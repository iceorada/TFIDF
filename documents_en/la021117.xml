<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, the respectable classes looked upon crime as
shocking -- on the eruption of violence in everyday life as
exceptional, on a body found in the library astonishing. In a society
where the FBI's Uniform Crime Report for 2001 records 15,980
homicides for the year, a corpse is less astonishing than a library,
crime is routine, respectability a volatile variable and events --
with all their chads left hanging -- tend to be unaccountable and
opaque.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Connelly is a compelling conjurer of chaos theory adjusted
to breaking news, and his "Chasing the Dime" a stunning exercise in
suspense and sci-fi technomagickry. Henry Pierce, a 34-year-old
chemist and Stanford PhD, is the head of Amedeus Technologies, a
catherine wheel of cutting-edge computer science. Holder of numerous
patents in the areas of molecular circuitry and molecular memory, he
is piling up ever more discoveries and inventions.</LD>
<LD>   As the curtain rises, Amedeus is racing to develop the first
practical molecular computer, whose power and possibilities will
revolutionize the world of electronics. Vastly more powerful than
silicon-based chips, molecular computer chips would unleash a tide of
dime-sized computers to turn digital e-literacy into global
illiteracy that would change the world -- and the bank balances of a
lot of people too.</LD>
<TE>   But Pierce has just been abandoned by Nicole, whom he still loves
after a three-year tryst (relationships have limited shelf lives in
Southern California, especially when mates spend too much time in the
lab and not enough in bed). The breakup leaves him discombobulated,
just when Amedeus prepares for the visit of a promising potential
investor. It also leaves the Amalfi Drive house to Nicole, while
Pierce moves to Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   But no sooner has he moved into a newly rented beachfront
apartment than his phone begins to ring with calls for someone named
Lilly; his electronic message box bulges with appeals for her. Who is
Lilly, what is she, that all the men pursue her? She must be a
prostitute. But then why did she suddenly drop out of circulation,
bequeath her number to the phone company and lose so much business?</TE>
<TE>   Pierce's quest for explanations provides a crash course in
electronic gadgetry (impressive) and electronic security (less so)
and a vivid guided tour through the maze of adult entertainment, Web
site porn, escort services, digital pimping and Internet sleaze (bad
for participants, good for profits), as well as the billions being
made off the electronic sex trade.</TE>
<TE>   The search for Lilly eats into Pierce's sanity, affects his
research, threatens his safety, jeopardizes his very freedom. What
started as a freelance investigation becomes an obsession pursued at
a breathless beat. The interests of his firm will not slacken it, nor
will the attentions that gangsters and police lavish on him.</TE>
<TE>   All this keeps one panting until the cliffhanging finale, in which
the underlying plot and its malicious generator are revealed; Pierce
is vindicated (which is good, because the death penalty process, as
real cases past and present often show, wastes a great deal of time).
So Connelly abides by the rules of classic detective stories by
offering a logical explanation, in the end, that reintroduces (some)
order into the chaos that he has craftily orchestrated. His plot
doesn't always hold water: Pierce's sudden infatuation doesn't quite
convince; his personality is more annoying than engaging; his
motivation more meretricious than credible. But griefs and annoyances
of this sort are minor irritants. When everything moves full tilt,
who has the time to think?</TE>

<DH>American Ground: Unbuilding the World Trade Center, William
Langewiesche, North Point Press: 206 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Bresnick</AU>
<BD>Adam Bresnick writes for several publications,
including the [London] Times Literary Supplement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several weeks ago, taking advantage of the recently restored service
on the No. 1 subway line, I rode past the World Trade Center stop on
my way down to Rector Street. Imposing metallic barriers have been
erected at the edge of the platforms to block the passenger's vista.
I was reminded of the zombie-like quality of the abandoned East
Berlin U-Bahn stations en route to the checkpoint at Friedrichstrasse
before the Berlin Wall's fall. An eerie calm prevails in the dry,
empty subway tunnel, and were it not for the thunder of memory, one
would pay no attention to the shuttered station platform under what
William Langewiesche poignantly calls "American Ground."</LD>
<LD>   The moral and technical challenge of getting down to that ground
in the wake of the attacks is the subject of Langewiesche's
remarkable account. Though some have complained that the book's
subtitle is arch, it is rather simply descriptive: Langewiesche sets
himself the task of recounting in sober prose how engineers and
workers set about the overwhelming labor of clearing 1.5 million tons
of debris from the devastated site.</LD>
<TE>   "American Ground" offers a painstaking insider's account of the
cleanup operation, as the author had apparently unlimited access to
the site. Indeed, during the months after Sept. 11, Langewiesche was
privy to many of the intricate political battles that transpired
there, most famously the strife between firefighters and the Giuliani
administration, which sought to place curbs on the FDNY's operation
because of safety concerns, resulting in the mini-riot of Nov. 2,
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Langewiesche's strategy of adopting an almost clinical discourse
is unusually cagey, especially as the unimaginable wound of the
attacks soon gave way to the endless emoting of television pundits.
In the wake of what was effectively a national post-traumatic stress
disorder, Langewiesche's dry attention to detail surreptitiously
restores the enormous trauma of the event. He is particularly good at
using facts and figures to conjure up the difficulty faced by the
wrecking crews: "Because the Twin Towers had been as much as 90
percent air and 10 percent structure, they had contained the
equivalent of approximately eleven solid stories of steel and
concrete." The mind boggles at realizing the composition of these
monumental towers, which upon crumbling registered on seismographs
with the intensity of a small earthquake. By mobilizing such
paradoxes, Langewiesche allows us to perceive the shock anew.</TE>
<TE>   Langewiesche also has a way of locating wicked ironies and
absurdities that give one pause. He describes how 308,000 tons of
structural steel and girders that once propped up the towers were
finally dumped into the cargo holds of an aging ship from Istanbul:
"It was high-quality metal, but too expensive for American mills, in
part because of high ground-transportation costs. Costs were more
relaxed elsewhere, of course. For better or worse, the scrap-steel
market is famously global." So it was that the beams that provided
the infrastructure of one of Manhattan's most famous building
complexes were shipped as scrap metal through the Panama Canal to be
melted down in China and sold worldwide. The remains of the trade
center became a commodity in the very world trade market Al Qaeda
sought to destroy.</TE>
<TE>   One of the book's most gripping sections describes an expedition
to what workers called "the final frontier," the site of the towers'
main chiller plant, one of the largest air-conditioning facilities in
the world. The plant was composed of seven refrigeration units, each
as big as a locomotive engine and each packed with up to 24,000
pounds of highly toxic Freon gas. Langewiesche and a hardy group of
engineers risk their lives by going on what he rather jauntily
describes as a "spelunking run." The men pass through a surreal
landscape: a parking garage filled with half-melted Lexuses, BMWs and
Jaguars; a vault belonging to the Bank of Nova Scotia that robbers
had attempted to pry open prior to the spelunking team's mission of
early October; a commuter bar "with its bottles of booze, its racks
of inverted glasses overhead, its open Heinekens on the counter." The
damage to the chiller plant turned out to be worse than the crew
expected, yet they were happy to find that the gas had vented, so
there was no danger of a Freon explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most riveting section of "American Ground" concerns
the technical particularities of the plane crashes, which
Langewiesche, a pilot, reconstructs with relentless precision.
Compared to the mass of the towers, "the oncoming 767 was a mere
pebble" but, as he explains, "the energy of an impact goes up
exponentially by the square of the increase in an airplane's speed."
The terrorists must have known this as they drove the plane at 586
mph, more than 150 miles faster than its speed limit at low altitude.
The airplane that destroyed the South Tower hit "about nine times
harder than it would have during a typical accident while on an
approach to a landing."</TE>
<TE>   Langewiesche describes in harrowing detail how 10,000 gallons of
"Jet A" kerosene poured over six floors of the building, burning
madly and "generating energy three to five times greater than that of
a standard nuclear power plant, [feeding] on wrecked office
furniture, computers, carpets, and aircraft cargo, but primarily it
fed on ordinary paper." Were it not for the paper, the fire would
perhaps not have reached the threshold necessary to melt the
structural steel. "It would be simplifying things, but not by too
much," Langewiesche writes, "to conclude that it was paperwork that
brought the South Tower down."</TE>
<TE>   Teeming with such paradoxes and ironies, "American Ground"
accomplishes the rare feat of restoring the unimaginable trauma to
the events of Sept. 11 and of presenting the everyday heroism of
those who cleared the site of its rubble.</TE>

<DH>The Stories of Alice Adams, Alice Adams, Alfred A. Knopf:
626 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Frank</AU>
<BD>Michael Frank is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years after Alice Adams' death, 53 of her short stories have
been brought together in one of those handsome, bulky volumes that
inevitably occasion -- seem, even, to expect -- a reconsideration of
a writer's relationship to a genre. The author of nearly a dozen
novels, four previous collections of stories and a travel memoir,
Adams was much celebrated for her short fiction: She was published
regularly in The New Yorker; she appeared in 23 O. Henry Award
collections and she received first prize six times; reviewers likened
her, variously, to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Flannery O'Connor and
Katherine Mansfield. It is with some anticipation, then, that a
reader sits down with these 600-plus pages to see how this writer
left her mark on the short story and, perhaps, how the short story
left its mark on her.</LD>
<TE>   "The Stories of Alice Adams" doesn't offer much helpful
chaperonage. The jacket copy, in describing them as her "best," is
the only indication that any standard or system of assessment has
been applied to selecting the work. The book comes without an
introduction. There is no explanation as to why the stories are
ordered the way they are (though from internal references the
principle seems to be chronological), and there is no sense of who is
guiding the enterprise and therefore responsible for allowing this
graceful, gifted writer to stand before her readers, so unmediated
and, alas, so uneven.</TE>
<TE>   Very few writers of short stories can survive having so much of
their work brought together in this fashion. Even Chekhov, in the
indispensable dozen-plus volumes of his short fiction in the old
Constance Garnett translations, delivers his share of the clunker or
the undeveloped sketch. There is something to be learned, however,
from watching a writer like Chekhov grow into his full embrace of the
story, but that is because Chekhov, in embracing the story,
eventually transformed it, whereas Adams writes in pretty much the
same mode at the end of this book as she does at the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   This said -- this grumbled? -- there is much to enjoy and admire
in the best of Adams' short fiction. Here is a writer who has a
natural, almost innate, gentility, an ease of being with language,
character, landscape, atmosphere and emotion that is both authentic
and modest. If these are watercolor, as opposed to oil paint, terms,
it is because Adams feels very much like a worker on paper, rather
than one on canvas. She is not a great dramatist. She makes collages,
assemblages of narrative, rather than building suspense, even
psychological suspense. She is fond of the aside: the stand-alone
paragraph or passage, the parenthetical remark or amplification that
merely adds texture and nuance. Many of Adams' stories feel like
sketches: They begin strong, move subtly and peter out by the end.
There are not often large, or sometimes even all that measurable,
shifts in her central characters, or their dynamics. Movement is
slow, spotty, subtle -- as in life, or certain kinds of lives.</TE>
<TE>   The stories tend to fall into two types: the reminiscence and the
snapshot. "Winter Rain," which appears early in the book, is one of
the reminiscences: The narrator looks back on a winter in Paris and
very vividly renders her younger self, her leftist lover and her old,
crisp, severe Gallic landlady. The story is a memory, formed and
fixed, nothing more -- and it is enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Greyhound People," one of Adams' best-known stories, belongs to
the snapshot variety: Here is a picture, pattern, character, place:
Its types are perfectly distilled: regular travelers on a bus route
from Sacramento to San Francisco, and that is sufficient for the
author. You come away from the story feeling that you have been taken
somewhere -- not enlightened so much, not shaken up -- merely shown.
Adams is a great shower of people, of place, of social moments and
moments of intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Adams sets women at the center of her stories more often than men
and white folk more often than people of color (although some of her
most empathic stories are about "the help" -- like "Verlie I Say Unto
You" and "Alaska"). She is not a writer of the ventriloquist variety:
There are no first-person stories in the voice of a man, for
instance; by most external markers, her characters seem close to her,
or your sense of her. They are largely straight, in both senses of
the word, and adults far more often than children. They are
frequently (too frequently) artists (or artistes): painters and
poets, musicians and the occasional actor; otherwise, they are
strictly professional: lawyers, doctors, editors, art dealers,
shrinks. Sometimes, they are animals -- Adams, as was Colette, was a
cat person, although she is not beyond attending to the dilemmas of
the life of a dog.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, Adams' people don't feel all that specific -- either
super sharply realized or idiosyncratic, deviant or eccentric. When a
character recurs in more than one story (like Posey Pendergast), she
is likely to be a caricature, in this case of a Southern dame. Her
older characters are more resonant, perhaps because Adams allows
herself to draw more liberally from full, rich past lives: the
eponymous character in "Elisabeth" is one example; Dr. Benito Zamora
(in "The Last Lovely City") is another; Jane Phelps, the narrator of
"Legends," is a third. All three linger beyond the stories that
confine them because of their more detailed relationship (or the
narrator's) to certain longer, more complex histories and themes:
friendship in "Elisabeth," social status and love in "City," and art,
fame and love (again) in "Legends."</TE>
<TE>   What happens to Adams' people? Well, they have a lot of love -- or
love problems, more accurately. This is her big subject. There is
love found and love lost, love expressed and love suppressed, love
fantasized over but never realized (the beautifully atmospheric "By
the Sea"), love fantasized over and meagerly realized ("Your Doctor
Loves You"). There is love that is like an illness ("Sintra"). There
is love that leads to marriage, love that leads to remarriage, love
that leads women and men outside of marriage. There is love that
turns to jealousy, love that turns to hate, love that gives a life
meaning and love that, when it ends, takes that meaning away.</TE>
<TE>   Sex comes up but is seldom explicit; even a story called "Great
Sex" is on this account tame (or, worse, hackneyed -- Adams actually
likens making love to "an earthquake, with deeper aftershocks"). She
does nostalgia far better. Many characters are displaced Southerners
in Northern California, and their visits home, or their memories of
home, bring out a good deal of deeply felt writing, as do their
journeys to Mexico, whose fragrant breezy beachscape is a frequent
backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   But Northern California is Adams' truest, most fully explored,
most hopeful region: "I was considering the possibilities of
California," says the narrator in "Greyhound People," "which just
then seemed limitless, enormous" -- this is true of Adams' characters
and, you surmise, their author as well. And San Francisco, which was
for many years Adams' home, is by far her most hopeful city. Hers is
a slightly precious, often foggy, regularly Oz-like San Francisco, a
place where her people are drawn, to conquer or to be suffocated or
reinvented or merely contained by.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Zamora, at the end of his life, remembers, for instance, how
"lonely he used to feel as he walked across those hills and stared at
massive apartment houses, at enormous family houses -- how isolated
and full of greed. He wanted the city, both to possess and to immerse
himself in it." By the end of his life, Dr. Zamora has actually
possessed parts of the city (experientially and tangibly -- he owned
apartment houses that made him rich), and as with most acts of
possession, it leaves him somewhat empty, somewhat wanting.</TE>
<TE>   Adams has a lot of human insight to offer her characters and
readers alike. Sometimes, this insight manifests itself as
encapsulations of human appearance, as of Deborah (in "Winter Rain"),
who is likened to a "bird that might topple over but never quite
did." Sometimes, it is the human interior she looks into: of a little
girl, Nell, in "For Good," she says, "Partly because she is so young,
she believes that what is said is meant." The narrator of "Legends"
says of herself, "I have noticed that after a time of deep sorrow the
greatest comfort may come from a person you do not know well." These
kinds of knowing remarks are Adams at her best.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over, for this connoisseur of the tribulations of love,
the human insight and the knowing remark take up the connection --
the connectedness -- between people, which despite all the assiduous
attention Adams gives it, receives (in "Snow") this paradoxical
declaration: "Any pairing is basically mysterious." This mystery is
one that Adams persists in coming at from all angles in these
stories, with -- despite the cumulative mixed results -- an enviable
persistence and an indisputably big heart.</TE>

<HD>A crusade to save the world</HD>
<DH>Balthasar's Odyssey, A Novel, Amin Maalouf, Translated from
the French by Barbara Bray, Arcade: 392 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Harris</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The year is 1666. Because 666 is the number of the Beast -- the
Antichrist prophesied in the Book of the Apocalypse -- the whole
Christian world trembles. Even Jews and Muslims fear that the end of
the world may be at hand. Signs and portents abound, from the rise of
false Messiahs in Ottoman Turkey to the Great Fire that devastates
London.</LD>
<LD>   It's a time not so different from our own. Lest we look back too
smugly on the ignorance and superstition of the 17th century, we
should remember our recent Y2K jitters and our insatiable appetite
for the "Left Behind" novels by Tim LaHaye and Larry B. Jenkins,
which exploit the same apocalyptic fervor. Then as now, nothing is
rarer than a sense of proportion, a voice of reason.</LD>
<TE>   Just such a voice is provided by Balthasar Embriaco, the narrator
of Amin Maalouf's latest novel, "Balthasar's Odyssey." He is a
wealthy, middle-age merchant -- a dealer in curios and rare books --
whose family came from Genoa, though it has lived in the Levant for
generations. A Catholic in a Muslim country, a businessman in contact
with learned people of all nations, Balthasar is skeptical of
religious dogmas and willing to befriend foreigners who share his
interests. He exhibits, in short, the spirit Maalouf applauds in his
best-known nonfiction work, "In the Name of Identity," whose message
can be summed up this way: To assume an identity -- to proclaim that
one belongs to a particular religion or country or ethnic group --
all too often means rejecting and stigmatizing those who don't
belong. "I'm convinced of it," the novel's hero reflects, "that trade
is the only respectable activity and those engaged in it the only
people who are civilized. The scoundrels Jesus drove out of the
Temple must have been not merchants, but soldiers and priests!"</TE>
<TE>   In the course of this picaresque tale, in which Balthasar journeys
by land and sea to Constantinople, Smyrna, Genoa, Tangier, Lisbon,
Amsterdam, London and Paris, his commitment to reason is sorely
tested. He is traveling, in fact, on a dubious errand to begin with:
to retrieve a book that reveals the 100th name of God, in addition to
the 99 listed in the Koran. Knowing this ultimate name, it is widely
believed, could save the world from its impending doom.</TE>
<TE>   Balthasar doubts this -- but not entirely. He has briefly
possessed the book but sold it unread. One of his sons, caught up in
Apocalypse fever, persuades him to chase after the new owner, a
French envoy to the Ottoman court. A fellow traveler, a woman,
complicates matters. She seeks a death certificate for her thuggish
husband, who has disappeared, so that she can remarry. And Balthasar,
a widower, is attracted to her.</TE>
<TE>   A picaresque novel is propelled by the sequence of events.
Balthasar must survive storms and plagues, bandits and corrupt
officials, swindlers of every stripe, and a deranged ship captain who
steers an erratic course to evade "winged demons," sea gulls. He also
must decide what to do when his newfound love, Marta, discovers that
her husband is still alive.</TE>
<TE>   But the real story is Balthasar's struggle to remain skeptical in
a world given over to the clash of fierce absolutes. "I can't go on
shutting myself up night and day in the citadel of my reason," he
says, "with my eyes shut and my hands over my ears, telling myself
it's all untrue, the whole world has got it wrong." To do so would
require superhuman strength, and Balthasar is only human.</TE>
<TE>   It's in telling this story that Maalouf, despite his historical
knowledge and his flowing style, lets us down a little. Balthasar is
a good guy but a ditherer, and his dithering takes up too many of
these pages. And the book he seeks may be truly magical; a strange
darkness descends on Balthasar whenever he tries to read it. Is he
simply afraid to learn the 100th name? This doesn't fit what we've
learned of his character. But if the book is magic, then what's the
value in his skepticism? Either way, it's a miscalculation.</TE>

<AU>Jonathan Kirsch</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to the Book
Review, is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at
God: The Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The whole world knows what the West looks like. Images of our meanest
streets and our most sublime stretches of wilderness are pounded into
the popular culture through movies, TV shows, 30-second spots and
music videos. But the phenomenon, we are reminded in a flurry of new
books, is at least five centuries old.</LD>
<LD>   From the very start, the depiction of the West was less rooted in
reality than in the imagination. Early cartographers like Henry
Briggs produced elaborate visualizations of the New World that were
rich in conjecture but lacking in geographical knowledge. Briggs, an
English mathematician, drew a map in 1625 that depicts California as
an island lying off the west coast of North America, thus fixing in
printed form what Paul E. Cohen in "Mapping the West" calls "one of
the most famous cartographical fallacies" in the long history of map
making. Indeed, the notion persisted until 1747, when King Ferdinand
VII of Spain sought to settle the matter once and for all with a
royal decree: "California is not an Island."</LD>
<TE>   "Mapping the West" is both a treatise on the history of map making
in North America and a celebration of cartographical glories and
curiosities over more than 300 years. The oldest map reproduced here,
attributed to the conquistador Hernan Cortes, dates to 1524 and
offers a colorful if highly fanciful example of how newcomers have
perceived (or misperceived) the West -- the lake that surrounds
Mexico City is depicted as far larger than the Gulf of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   A fascinating array of styles and sensibilities is reproduced and
annotated here, from a 1578 map of the American Southwest that
purports to show "the seven lordly cities of Cibola ... gold and
gem-encrusted" to John Wesley Powell's 1878 "Map of Utah Territory,"
a work of exacting topographical detail. Perhaps the single most
arresting image in "Mapping the West" -- and one that expresses its
remarkable reach -- is an 1876 battle map by a man called One Bull
that depicts the Battle of Little Bighorn from the perspective of the
Lakota and Cheyenne warriors who engaged and defeated Gen. George
Custer and the 7th Cavalry.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the book makes the point that the vast cartographical
enterprise that began in the early 16th century was not completed
until the verge of the 21st century: the Owyhee Desert of northern
Nevada and southeastern Oregon, we are told, was not mapped in detail
until the mid-1980s. Thus, as David Rumsey reminds us in an
introduction to Cohen's book, until very recently we could still
relive the experience of men and women for whom the American West
was, as their maps put it, "terra incognita" and thereby gain "an
admiration verging on awe for the explorers who had no maps at all to
guide them."</TE>
<TE>   While maps always have been tools of politics and diplomacy, the
visual arts have been put to use in service of Manifest Destiny, the
half-political, half-theological notion that transplanted Europeans
were destined to conquer all of North America, as we are shown in
"American Sublime" by Andrew Wilton and Tim Barringer, a sumptuous
collection of work from the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Cole (1801-1848), for example, rendered a series of five
heroic paintings, titled "The Course of Empire," that depict a dreamy
landscape, strongly reminiscent of ancient Rome but actually inspired
by his own vision of the American wilderness. The paintings were an
exercise in propaganda. "Mingled with the triumph of art," wrote one
newspaper critic when the series was put on display in 1836, "is the
triumph of the conqueror.... "</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, art, politics and commerce were compounded into a
single grand enterprise. In 1872, for example, Congress voted an
appropriation of $10,000 to purchase "The Grand Canyon of the
Yellowstone" by Thomas Moran (1837-1926), a gargantuan canvas that
the artist had "cannily arranged to have exhibited in the Hall of
Representatives." Moran's art was embraced, too, by the new
conquistadors of 19th century America whose weapons were spikes and
rails. "The power of these images of an almost unimaginably distant
and strange landscape to promote travel, exploration and tourism was
quickly understood by the new railway barons, who commissioned from
Moran pictures that they could use in advertising their services,"
writes Wilton.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, the color plates reproduced in "American Sublime"
seem to be nothing more than pretty pictures. Only when the authors
put them back into the political and cultural context in which they
were created do the images take on new meanings, and only then do we
begin to see the sometimes grandiose intentions of the artists who
painted them and the art collectors who displayed them.</TE>
<TE>   Both Cole and Moran figure prominently in "The Anatomy of Nature,"
but for a very different reason. They are among six landscape artists
whom author Rebecca Bedell singles out as exemplars linking art,
science and politics in 19th century America. "[T]hey struggled to
create respected, valued, and profitable positions for themselves ...
as educators, moralists, patriots, explorers, and facilitators of
national expanse and economic development," argues Bedell. "In all of
these ambitious undertakings, the artists' knowledge of geology
played a part."</TE>
<TE>   "The Anatomy of Nature" reveals the origins of fine art in oblique
but illuminating ways. Bedell shows us, for example, the battered
wooden box in which artist Thomas Cole kept his own collection of
minerals, fossils and stone artifacts. "As his mineral cabinet
suggests," she writes, "Cole made no firm distinction between art and
science, between human history and natural history."</TE>
<TE>   Moran, too, was no mere salon painter. He accompanied three "Great
Surveys" of the American West, including one conducted by Powell, and
his heroic canvases of the Yellowstone and Colorado rivers are
informed by his firsthand experience of the wilderness: "Artists and
scientists ... shared the same bread-and-bacon meals and faced the
same hardships and dangers," writes Bedell. "Photographing,
sketching, and painting were alternate modes of collecting samples,
taking notes, performing analyses, and making reports."</TE>
<TE>   Thus did art and science contribute to the westward thrust of the
American enterprise. "[G]eologists and landscape painters," argues
Bedell, "were able to collaborate in numerous social endeavors:
promoting patriotism, spreading scientific knowledge, teaching moral
lessons, inspiring religious awe, encouraging westward expansion, and
fostering tourism."</TE>
<TE>   Map making and painting, of course, were established art forms
when Europeans first arrived in the New World. Photography, by
contrast, was a technology that emerged just as the exploration of
the Western frontier was reaching its end: "a new medium and a new
place that came of age together in the nineteenth century," as Martha
A. Sandweiss puts it in "Print the Legend."</TE>
<TE>   Sandweiss acknowledges that the West had long been the subject of
"paintings and prints, maps and drawings," as we have seen here, but
she insists that "photographs seemed to make this imagined place more
real." As early as the 1840s, shortly after the invention of the
daguerreotype, and continuing with ever-increasing effect over the
remaining decades of the 19th century, images of the West -- the
Mexican-American War and the California Gold Rush, Geronimo and
Custer, Yellowstone and Yosemite and the Grand Canyon -- were being
seen all over the world. "[N]o part of the American historical
imagination," insists Sandweiss, "is so shaped by visual imagery as
its image of the nineteenth-century American West."</TE>
<TE>   Sandweiss includes a variety of vintage photographs, ranging from
a hand-colored battle scene from the Mexican-American War to a
"Wyoming Cow-boy" so stereotypical that it seems almost comical. But
her book is meant to serve as a work of social and cultural history,
and she makes the point, which applies as forcefully to landscape
painting and map making as it does to photography, that an image can
distort and ultimately replace the hard reality that it purports to
depict.</TE>
<TE>   A telling moment comes when she describes the work of
turn-of-the-century Montana photographer Laton A. Huffman, who made
and marketed about 83,000 photographs of the American West. For
Huffman, as Sandweiss explains, "Montana's charm lay not in the
complicated present, but in a storied past characterized by
picturesque scenes of cowboy life." And Huffman offered "to make his
prints more true to imagined memory than ever the original scenes had
been" by painting in elements: prairie dogs, buffalo chips, distant
hills or nearer buttes.</TE>
<TE>   "With a hair on a stick," as Huffman himself put it, he could
enhance his photographs with "the wanted details," thus anticipating
the work that is now done with microprocessors by the movie makers
and music video directors who are the latest generation of myth
makers in the American West.</TE>
<TE>   The essential quality of a frontier, of course, is the opportunity
for self-invention. That's why the West attracted not only explorers,
pioneers and entrepreneurs but also utopians, fantasists and zealots
of all kinds -- and still does. Artists, map makers and photographers
were no less susceptible to the impulse to remake what their eyes
beheld, and they left behind unique visual evidence of the whole
process. Indeed, these four books remind us that even the most
earnest effort to capture the West in an image -- a 16th century map
no less than a 21st century music video -- is inevitably an act of
imagination and sometimes an act of distortion.</TE>

<HD>An empty landscape, a sublime discovery</HD>
<DH>Soul of Nowhere: Traversing Grace in a Rugged Land, Craig
Childs, Sasquatch Books: 224 pp., $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Kittredge</AU>
<BD>William Kittredge is the author of many books,
including "The Nature of Generosity," "Who Owns the West?" and "Hole
in the Sky: A Memoir," which won a PEN West literary award in 1993.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First-rate writers and books keep emerging from the American West and
delineating the Western experience in smart, edgy ways. Lately there
have been Judy Blunt, a memoirist who tells of leaving the
constraints of ranch life in the vicinity of Montana's Fort Peck
Reservoir in "Breaking Clean," and novelist Judith Freeman, who, in
"Red Water," depicts the haunting results of violence following
Utah's Mountain Meadows Massacre.</LD>
<LD>   And there's also Craig Childs, a younger writer focused on natural
history. Childs tells stories of scientific discovery and adventure
in the field. His special competence lies in close, accurate and
evocative descriptions of the natural processes that shape evolving
life in the American Southwest. Childs is a fountain of
confirmed-on-the-ground, often surprising knowledge when it comes to
understanding interwoven biological complexity. And he's not afraid
to tell us what he thinks it all means.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000's "The Secret Knowledge of Water," Childs tells of hiring
out to research the availability of ground water in Arizona's Cabeza
Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, parking his pickup truck and walking
off into the most arid territory in North America. He followed bees
and other insects and found thunderstorm water in stone pockets
called tinajas. Lots of it. "The canyon narrowed into a resistant
rock, a hardened volcanic slurry that turned soft in its eroded
shapes. The narrows burrowed down so that the walls became curved
rather than sharp, squeezing until they revealed a disk of water
fifteen feet across. Two thousand fifty-three gallons of rainwater."</TE>
<TE>   That find, amid thousands of square miles of aridity, was
"overpowering, like coming across blood on the snow." He found toads
70 miles from the nearest permanent springs and water fleas "hardly
visible to the naked eye." Under a hand lens, a flea was "as fine and
crystalline as an ornament of blown glass, its body almost invisible
except for faint shadows of internal organs." Examined under a
powerful microscope, the water from that tinaja and others that were
ranged above it in that canyon, each overflowing into the one below,
"appeared as if full of broken slivers of glass, countless fragile
organisms." So an exercise in seeing accurately revealed evolving
insect communities that were utterly dependent on random
thunderstorms. The news seems to be that life survives where water
goes, so long as our planet isn't burned to an utterly dry cinder.</TE>
<TE>   On a weeks-long hike into the Grand Canyon described in "Soul of
Nowhere," visiting the springs the Hopi and Zuni claim as their
tribal emergence sites, places from which their ancestors came out
onto the surface of the Earth, Childs and a friend climb onto a cliff
in wetsuits. They venture into a cave from which a "fire hose" flow
of water emerges to free-fall 40 stories and they "walk inside of a
spring." They want, his friend says, "to pierce the veil."</TE>
<TE>   "The rock, a hard limestone, was sharpened into small thorns and
razors," Childs writes. "If I were to lose my grip I would be
hamburgered before getting another hold, before getting washed out of
the waterfall." A "quarter mile into that desert cliff," in "the
belly of the mother," they climb into a domed, utterly lightless
chamber their headlamps reveal to be a "garden of waterfalls and
pools." Beginning to suffer hypothermia, Childs faces a silent
dripping chamber at the end of this cave and tells himself to
"remember the silence." A cave -- alive with rushing water and
life-threatening adventure, significance inside secrecy, a weave of
circumstance -- generates metaphor and meaning.</TE>
<TE>   In "Soul of Nowhere," Childs tells of a precipitous route down
from the north rim of the Grand Canyon to the Colorado River. It had
been used by the Anasazi almost 1,000 years earlier, forgotten and
rediscovered by a legendary canyon explorer, mathematician George
Steck. How the Anasazi found the route, which works along cliffs into
a cave explorers called "the wormhole," Childs says, "is difficult to
imagine." It was "a major feat of relationship with the land." How
Steck rediscovered it is also difficult to imagine.</TE>
<TE>   When Childs' party of climbers entered the cave, they found "the
ceiling above streaked black with smoke scars. It was easy to imagine
a procession of Anasazi doing the same, carrying torches of wrapped
juniper bark and pine pitch, lighting their way toward the wormhole."</TE>
<TE>   "Back in total darkness was a hole, hardly as wide as my hips. It
was a trap door in the floor. The rest of the limestone in the cave
was sharp and broken, but here, leading into the hole, it was smooth
as porcelain. This was the wormhole. The limestone had been burnished
by the passage of human skin. Anasazi skin." Childs and his friends
scooted down the wormhole and emerged on a balustrade hanging over a
cliff. Below, the Anasazi had set a sequence of ladders. "The Grand
Canyon is so immense," Childs says, "and yet this is what it comes
to, a hole barely big enough to fit through."</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance to yet another forgotten, rediscovered route,
Childs finds "a field of thumbprints dabbed on a wall with ochre and
white paint in the shape of a giant abacus." There were 900 such
thumbprints, and their presence resonates.</TE>
<TE>   If there's a problem in this book, it has to do with naming the
ineffable. Writing that attempts naming qualities like the "soul" of
a natural place is semi-impossible to bring off. The ineffable -- for
instance, the feelings generated by a sexual orgasm or powder snow
skiing -- is by nature indescribable and not nameable even though
readers can easily be incited to imagine it for themselves. But
Childs gives the naming a shot, and he pays for it by occasionally
floundering off into abstract rhapsodizing. Writing about natural
systems as if they were creatures, for instance, speaking of "staring
directly into the eyes" of a place, is a subset of the same thing. I
wish he'd cut out the anthropomorphizing. But such complaints are
small potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   As he blends a continuously interwoven skein of metaphor about our
relationship to what we call "natural," Childs is part of an ancient
tradition: interest in "the sublime," which dates at least to Middle
Eastern Christian mystics known as the Desert Fathers, who saw that
contact with wildness generated an aesthetic and spiritual idea
implied by vastnesses -- the mountains, deserts, seascapes and starry
skies -- essentially an impression of limitless powers that transcend
understanding and are indifferent to human enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   Around AD 200, in the essay "On the Sublime," attributed to the
Greek Longinus, the sublime was defined as a reminder of human
frailty and insignificance. Cowed and awed by the same phenomena,
we're reminded that it's a good idea to stay humble. Confronting 900
thumbprints left by unknown Anasazi, humans with souls like ours, or
eyeing drifting sands, we contemplate the unknowable and our own
situation and find solace in the fact that we are part of everything.
It follows that in taking care of complexities both biological and
otherwise, we care for our homelands, neighborhoods, families and
selves.</TE>
<TE>   The sublime is a concept that's been a mainstay of poets from
Virgil to Wordsworth and particularly of artists confronting the
spectacular in the American West, painters like Albert Bierstadt and
Thomas Moran in the 19th century, 20th century figures like Georgia
O'Keeffe in New Mexico and the photographer Ansel Adams in Yosemite
and writers like my particular heroes, Mari Sandoz, Wallace Stegner,
Edward Abbey and Leslie Marmon Silko.</TE>
<TE>   Childs, as he tells us in detail about how his world works and of
his doubts, joys, fears and discoveries, is finding his way in that
tradition, and his willingness to risk naming the ineffable can be
seen as a virtue. He seems so far to be the real item, a useful
artist, given to reaching, to opening doors.</TE>

<DH>The Story of Lucy Gault, A Novel, William Trevor, Viking:

<BD>Jonathan Levi is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Captain Everard Gault wounded the boy in the right shoulder on the
night of June the twenty-first, nineteen twenty-one." There is
something ripely short story-ish about the opening sentence of
William Trevor's latest novel, "The Story of Lucy Gault." The single
shot suggests a single plot -- a tale of revenge, perhaps, with the
precise date of a police blotter, fixed at a distant point in
history, an age of exotic names like Everard Gault. But it is a mark
of Trevor's widely acknowledged mastery of the numerous ways the
English language can affect and manipulate the human mind that he is
able to turn this single shooting into a complex and thoroughly
extraordinary novel.</LD>
<LD>   The setting is Ireland, of course, County Cork. Everard Gault is a
veteran of World War I, Anglo-Irish, landed gentry, with a large
house set up above the coast, living with his English-born wife,
Heloise, in a genteel comfort afforded by her income. The wounded boy
is one of the local lads, driven by indeterminate republican fervor
to torch the houses of those richer and more English than he. Everard
intended to shoot high, to merely frighten the boy away. Accidents
will happen.</LD>
<TE>   The Gaults have little choice after the incident. The wounded
boy's family will not accept an apology. Other boys will come and try
again to burn the Gaults out. And Everard and Heloise have
responsibilities greater than the protection of their house --
namely, a 9-year-old daughter named Lucy. They must abandon Ireland
and settle in England.</TE>
<TE>   But Lucy, an independent girl who loves nothing more than to run
to the beach with a stray dog and swim naked in the waves, will not
go. On the day before they are due to leave Ireland, she decides to
run away to the home of a former servant, but trips in the forest and
sprains her ankle. Going in search of her, Everard wanders down to
the beach. His discovery of a half-buried scrap of his daughter's
clothing from an earlier swim leads to tragic misunderstanding.
Assuming their daughter has drowned, Everard and Heloise run from
Ireland in shock and finality, leaving neither travel plans nor
forwarding address. A few weeks later, half-starved and lame, Lucy
stumbles out of the woods. Neither the servants, who have been left
to close up the house, nor the solicitor who has been entrusted with
little more than the Gaults' departure, are prepared for the
reappearance of this demi-ghost. Attempts are made to contact her
parents. But the misfortune initiated by Everard's rifle shot is too
great to engender any hope. The parents will not return.</TE>
<TE>   Years pass. In Italy, the parents sit in oblivion, desperately
trying to ignore the tragedy on that distant green island. "Expert
now at altering sentences already begun, or allowing them to wither
or smiling them away, they gave themselves to the unfamiliarity of
the place they had arrived in as invalids of distress, to its rocky
hills and narrow streets, to a language they learnt as children do,
to the simplicities of where they dwelt."</TE>
<TE>   In Ireland, Lucy grows up tended by the last two servants, avoided
by schoolchildren and villagers and steeped in her guilt. "The
tragedy called down upon herself by a child, and what had since
become her life, made a talking point, and seemed to strangers to be
the material of legend."</TE>
<TE>   Legends need endings. Were "The Story of Lucy Gault" simply a
short story, there would be only two possible endings: reconciliation
or not. But Trevor is a more ingenious and more subtly ambitious
writer. As he pulls time forward to unveil the strange sideshows that
Lucy's unthinking escapade has engendered, narrative gives way to
poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years after the fact, as the 1940s give way to the '50s,
the wounded boy -- a veteran himself of yet a second world war --
returns to the scene of his shooting wearing a haunting stigma. In
Europe, Everard paces in Flanders Fields, revisiting "the places of
his war. Tramping over soil fed by the blood of the men he had led
and whose faces now stirred in his memory, it was his wife's response
that came -- as if in compensation for too little said before -- when
he wondered why his wandering had led him back to these old
battlefields: in his sixty-ninth year he was establishing his
survivor's status."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the survivors meet. Eventually the distinction between
perpetrator and victim, actor and acted-upon, fades as time moves the
story out of the mists of a past of dim communication into a present
age of telephones and e-mails. What remains is tragedy, stubborn and
unyielding, struggling for satisfaction -- and the brilliant heroine
that Trevor has created in Lucy, as strong and solitary as Bronte's
Cathy and Sophocles' Antigone, but ten times as resilient. A
survivor.</TE>
<TE>   The search for reconciliation, for a lasting peace, is as elusive,
as Irish and Catholic as it is human and Earth-wide. But the poetry
of Trevor's novel is aimed above politics, even if it strikes fully
at the heart.</TE>
<TE>   "Love is greedy when it is starved," Heloise tells her husband one
day, many years into their exile. "Don't you remember, Everard? Love
is beyond all reason when it is starved." Nursing love back from
starvation, as Lucy Gault discovers, comes at the mercy of time
"fickle in its arrangements," and it certainly is no short story.</TE>

<HD>One woman lifts the veil on her Islamic life</HD>
<DH>Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood, A Memoir of Growing Up
Female in a Muslim World, Taslima Nasrin, Translated from the Bengali
by Gopa Majumdar, Steerforth Press: 308 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a decade ago, Muslim clerics in Bangladesh issued a series
of fatwas against a 31-year-old woman who had written a novel they
found offensive. The woman, Taslima Nasrin, was a physician from a
small town in the northern part of the country. Having worked as an
anesthesiologist in the gynecological department of a hospital, she
had treated scores of battered women and raped girls who had no legal
or social recourse against their attackers. Prompted by these
experiences, Nasrin had written a series of newspaper columns
addressing the question of women's rights under Islam. In 1993, she
had spoken out against the stoning death of a woman whose second
marriage had been deemed a violation of Islamic law: The woman was
buried waist-deep in a pit and killed with more than 100 stones.
Later that year, Nasrin's "Shame" was published -- a novel about the
plight of Hindu citizens of Bangladesh under Muslim rule. This, the
clerics declared, was the last straw. Nasrin's writings were
officially deemed apostasy -- an offense punishable in Islam by death
-- and a fatwa was issued with a price on her head.</LD>
<TE>   Through the summer of 1994, 300,000 Bengali Muslims participated
in violent nationwide strikes against Nasrin. Prompted by the
mullahs, they demanded her arrest and public hanging. The government
responded by bringing criminal charges against Nasrin. She was forced
into hiding and later exile, where she lingers still, but she was not
silenced. Over the last eight years, she has continued to write
novels, essays and poetry. And she has published the first volume of
her memoirs.</TE>
<TE>   "Meyebela" is the story of a young girl born into a middle-class
Muslim family in what in 1962 was still East Pakistan. Nasrin's
father is a former peasant who received a secular education and who
now practices as a physician in government employ. He personifies the
often torturous plight of many citizens of traditional societies
engaged in the effort of secular modernization: He is enlightened
enough to believe in the rule of Reason above Faith, the merits of
secular laws over religious ones and the importance of education for
both men and women. But he cannot shake the vestiges of a thousand
years of inherited thought, the legacy of lies, cruelty and violence
that is often visited upon the weak -- women, children and ethnic and
religious minorities -- in such societies.</TE>
<TE>   So, he marries his wife when she is only 12, but he does allow her
to stay in school until her own father steps in to put an end to such
foolishness. He bemoans his wife's ignorance, but he keeps her
restricted to the house much of the time and makes every decision,
large and small, regarding the family. He tells his children that an
education is the only possible route to happiness, but he beats them
-- and his wife -- violently when they fail his expectations, straps
his sons to a tree when they disobey him, and he makes his daughters
rub mustard oil in their eyes so as not to fall asleep over their
books at night. He practices medicine -- a science devoted to
improving human life -- but he loots the homes of his Hindu neighbors
after they are driven away in the war of independence in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Nasrin grows up watching her mother, aunts and female neighbors be
beaten and humiliated by their men. She lives in a permanent state of
terror at her father's ever-increasing violence. She is so alienated
by him that she forgets how to speak in his presence. She understands
quickly that her mother has no refuge or escape: The laws of the
country, based on Islamic principles, recognize no rights for women,
and their upbringing -- little or no education, no job training and
very limited contact with the world outside the house -- has
virtually ensured that they will starve to death without help from a
man.</TE>
<TE>   Almost by instinct, therefore, Nasrin keeps to herself the fact
that she has been molested by a male cousin and an uncle. She stands
by quietly as her mother pleads for help under her husband's blows,
as her brother is almost killed by their father, as her mother, in
turn, beats and starves the servant girls in the house. She is too
weak to fight the seemingly invincible, but she does know enough to
distinguish between what is and what should be.</TE>
<TE>   When Nasrin is in elementary school, her mother's helplessness
leads to a depression that leaves her nearly mad. She emerges from
the depression in the early 1970s, only to become a regular at the
home of a fundamentalist cleric who promises eternal salvation at the
expense of earthly suffering.</TE>
<TE>   In the mullah's home, young women are kept prisoner in windowless
rooms with near unbearable heat and humidity. They are brought here
by their fathers as punishment for bad behavior, or if they are
believed to be possessed by jinn. To cure the girls, the mullah's
officers beat them, or visit with them behind closed doors. Every
day, visitors come to pray at the mullah's feet -- the women fighting
each other for a chance to touch the mullah, waiting for him to
expectorate so they may swallow the phlegm or rub it on their faces
and chests in hopes that his holiness will be transmitted through his
fluids. They bring the mullah money and food, massage his body, take
to heart his every admonition, every command, every warning of
damnation if they stray from the path.</TE>
<TE>   None of this makes sense to young Nasrin. At school, she has
learned about the moon landing, but the mullah tells her mother that
this is "just a rumor spread by Christians." She has learned to eat
at a table, that slavery is wrong and that attacking innocent
neighbors is a sin. The mullah, however, has said that it is "sinful
to eat at a table. Jews and Christians do that." He claims that the
Koran permits men to have sexual relations with their female slaves,
that real Muslims have a duty to attack and set fire to Hindu homes.
"This is simply an effort to save Islam from its enemies," he says.
Surely, Nasrin imagines, the mullah has misinterpreted the Koran,
presented his own version to the scores of believers who, illiterate
in Bengali, have the additional handicap of having to recite prayers
in Arabic, a language they do not understand. But Nasrin's logic,
like the locks her father puts on the doors to stop his wife from
leaving for the mullah's house, is no match for the woman's new
fundamentalism. When Nasrin questions the mullah's teachings, her
mother berates and beats her. When she asks the meaning of the
prayers her mother forces her to recite in Arabic, she is threatened
with hell's fire. Still hoping that her mother has misunderstood
Islam, she searches the house and finds a Bengali translation of the
Koran. Here, she reads that the "earth always stands still. If it
does not lean on one side, it is because all the mountains, acting
like nails, are holding it in place." She reads that "[o]ne of the
bones in a woman's neck is crooked. That is the reason why no woman
thinks straight, or walks on a straight path." She reads that "if a
woman is disobedient, her husband has the right to ... talk some
sense into her, but if she remains disobedient, he can beat her." She
reads that men can have four wives, that they can divorce any of them
simply by uttering the word talaq -- divorce -- three times. Women
are not allowed to seek a divorce at all.</TE>
<TE>   If the Koran contains such principles, 14-year-old Nasrin
concludes, then it isn't a single man or mullah one can blame for the
injustice committed against women; it is Islam itself, the rule of
blind faith at the expense of reason, of religion instead of logic.
"Meyebela" ends at the threshold of this realization. It will be many
years until the quiet young girl will find the voice and the heart to
commit blasphemy and earn a fatwa or two. Her courage is all the more
stunning to those who have lived under the reign of silence that
pervades the Muslim world, who have seen how not only men but also
very often women join in the effort to perpetuate fear and violence
against other females, how a dissenting voice, a rebel mind, is
quickly reformed or purged.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, however, it isn't Nasrin's courage or even the horror
of what she must endure under the fatwa that makes her story
remarkable: It is the message she brings to the well-intentioned
observers in the West who have explained away the damage caused by
the rule of Islam in terms of economic misery or the loss of identity
in the Muslim world. This wish not to offend believers of another
religion, not to criticize what we do not understand or not to impose
Western values on the East, although noble in its intentions, misses
the point entirely: The truth, as Nasrin and a handful of other brave
souls have dared to utter, is that not all traditions are worthy of
keeping, that not all long-held principles are equally valid. Not
every word written in a holy book -- any holy book -- is indeed holy.
Not every attempt to bring enlightenment to the shadows of ignorance
can be dismissed as "cultural imperialism."</TE>
<TE>   In the West, reform movements within Christianity and Judaism, and
the separation of church and state, have brought much-needed relief
from the inevitable tyranny of absolutist thought. In the Muslim
world so far, as in all other places and times where religion has
ruled supreme, the biggest victims of faith have been the believers
themselves.</TE>

<DH>Women Who Run the Show: How a Brilliant and Creative New
Generation of Women Stormed Hollywood, 1973-2000, Mollie Gregory, St.
Martin's Press: 400 pp., $26.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynda Obst</AU>
<BD>Lynda Obst, a producer at Paramount Pictures, is the
author of "Hello, He Lied: And Other Truths From the Hollywood
Trenches."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"We forget history so fast in this country," a television writer
named Dianne Dixon told Mollie Gregory. "Like water on a hot
sidewalk, it evaporates before it's recorded." It's a telling quote
that captures the importance of Gregory's recent book, "Women Who Run
the Show," an exhaustively researched, if not elegantly written, tome
about how a band of sisters crashed the all-boys party that was
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory's is encyclopedic oral history; the index alone refers to
just about every woman who strode through the halls of network
television and studio back lots over the last 20 years -- at least
the ones I ever heard of and many I had not -- and it comes just in
time to record a history that seems in danger of seeming trivial. "I
don't think there's been a women's movement in a decade. Is that
dangerous?" a former business affairs executive is quoted as saying.
Good question, well worth answering.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody seems to know what post-feminism is, but we are definitely
in it," Gregory concludes. "Scholars have defined it as cultural
constrictions favoring those men in power.... It points to struggles
that were won, and they're over." Definitely over, but won? True,
women producers are now commonplace, and three studios are run by
three remarkably gifted women. This would have been unimaginable a
brief 15 years ago despite their undeniable talent.</LD>
<TE>   But there are fewer women directors than 10 years ago, and nowhere
near parity in writing in film or television. But most troubling is
the increasing attrition of women in the middle ranks because of
exhaustion. Of late, it has become a kind of status to leave your
high-paying job to stay at home with a late-life child or for
marriage to be the goal of middle-management development-girls, as it
used to be for dental assistants. While signs of extraordinary change
are omnipresent, most women sense ambivalence from their bosses when
dealing with a pregnancy. That reaction creates conflict matching a
woman's own internal ambivalence. It's this internal ambivalence that
troubles me.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory's book reveals the chasm between then and now, more like
an eon than a mere 20 years. To wit, Paramount Chairman Sherry
Lansing, the foremost of the great dames of Hollywood, recalls her
expectations at the beginning of her career: "[I]f we sought
careers," she tells Gregory, "we could become a nurse or teacher.
They are wonderful professions but they were practically the only
ones open to women. I sort of accepted the fact that a woman would
never run a company." Now she has run Paramount for an unprecedented
10 years and is still standing. Yet women all over Hollywood are in
retreat.</TE>
<TE>   Pop culture indicates that this is not just a local backlash --
indeed, it is endemic to the culture at large -- but like everything
else in Hollywood's value system, it is most bald and cravenly
unapologetic here. I first noticed the sea change when I read Drew
Barrymore -- a woman I know to be smart and ambitious -- deny with
horror that she was a feminist. The word suddenly had an icky
old-fashioned quality that she took for granted. It stunned me.</TE>
<TE>   Where is Susan Faludi when we need her? Why is no one calling this
by its real name: backlash? But this is a female-driven backlash from
formerly driven women or their proteges, all under the approving gaze
of the men in power, denouncing the life of the Big Career. These are
the newly chic stay-at-home mothers who shine at their children's
schools' fund-raising but are free enough for a manicure in the
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Women in Hollywood are dropping like flies. Off to the suburbs to
bury the hatchet of the dream career and erect the white picket fence
we once saw as jail. Say goodbye to striving for success. Say hello
to striving for status, for safety, for the comfort of the husband's
financial umbrella, so that only he will feel the tremors and dread
of the fray. We're off to redecorate, to wax -- the floor, whatever.
It was far more horrible out there than anyone led us to expect.</TE>
<TE>   Where have all the brave women gone? Off to try out new painful
cosmetic surgeries? Doesn't anyone remember how painfully poignant it
was to grow up with a brilliant mother stuck in the suburbs with
nothing to do? Doesn't anyone else see Betty Friedan around the
corner? Why does Donna Reed suddenly look more glamorous than Mary
Richards?</TE>
<TE>   This backlash is powered by disappointment with the realities of
work and the difficulty of balancing family and career. This backlash
is anti-mentor, anti-superwoman, pro-girly girl. It is -- as we know
by watching Christina Aguilera -- OK to be a slut. It is not OK to
break into a sweat out of the gym. About five years ago, I started
noticing that the development-boys were the less entitled ones, the
male interns doing the heavy Xeroxing on the weekend, unable to take
their historic gender advantage for granted. But I fear the girls are
too busy on Saturdays now, yoga and all. Sadly, we are no longer able
to reap pleasure from the novelty of and gratitude for the job.
Gregory's book remembers the moment that we were. Once we were the
men we wanted to marry. No longer. Sorry, boys, that we took your
jobs. What were we thinking? You can have them back now.</TE>
<TE>   The generation Gregory has documented fought for a baby-friendly
workplace. This is the world the late Dawn Steel experienced at
Paramount in 1986: "Everything changed with the pregnancy," she is
quoted in "Women Who Run the Show." "Maybe they had changed
beforehand and I wasn't aware of it. But they didn't like me anymore.
Period." Now it is the unwritten prerogative in the movie business
for both genders to leave work for a parenting occasion, no matter
how small. But Steel -- the first woman (one of the first two -- with
Lansing -- that is) to run a major Hollywood studio when she was
named president of Columbia Pictures in 1989 -- founded day-care
centers. Today, work and family seem more irreconcilable than ever,
and it is common to question whether or not the whole enterprise is
remotely worth the effort.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder whether the women mentored by these pioneers dare to
reach out to young women. If so, where are the young execs and
producers to show for it? Are we breeding new leaders to succeed the
ones now reigning? The women whose battle-weary stories fill this
book (including the thousandth retelling of the Polly Platt-Peter
Bogdanovich breakup) were of the "equal-opportunity generation," my
old partner Debra Hill told Gregory. They are "no-one-ever-told
me-I-couldn't-do-something-so-I-just-went-out-and-did-it" kind of
gals. Who could have believed that 15 years later, it could be women
discouraging women from chasing hard jobs like these?</TE>
<TE>   We may need to wait for our eager daughters, those empowered
chicklets who are opening movies every weekend, for the newest
market, girl power. This next generation will redeem the one whose
head-cracking struggles are depicted here, where they are rightly
anointed as the "brilliant and creative new generation of women who
stormed Hollywood." Scattered throughout Gregory's book are stories
of parking spots denied, sly passes passed on and daily petty
humiliations. It was only 15 years ago that a woman's presence in a
meeting elicited dubious stares and demeaning requests for bottled
water. The tales here told vary from the iconic Steel -- fired as
president of production as she gave birth -- to pioneer camerawomen
Brianne Murphy, who was asked by her crew if she had her own light
meter. "It's like asking a driver if his car had tires.... I had so
much to learn from them, but they never talked to me about what I
needed to know."</TE>
<TE>   We are indebted to Gregory for committing to history those who
would underestimate their own gains. Storm Hollywood they did, and
what permanent effect their cumulative efforts may have on the
culture at large will not be measured by this temporal backlash
alone. It will incubate in the young girls watching their stories on
screen for the first time. This thought is expressed beautifully by
producer Laura Ziskin at the end of the book: "Men have built the
cities, made and defined the culture, interpreted the world. At no
time in recorded history have women been culture-makers. Movies are
arguably the most influential, important medium in the world. They
have a tremendous cultural impact. Because women are now making
movies, then women's ideas, philosophy, point of view will seep into
that culture. And that's never happened in history. Ever, ever, ever.
We can't even see the impact of that yet." Amen.</TE>

<AU>Emran Qureshi</AU>
<BD>Emran Qureshi is co-editor of "The New Crusades:
Constructing the Muslim Enemy," to be published by Columbia
University Press.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine if you will the delicious and absurd fantasy of the Beverly
Hillbillies taking over the Vatican and proselytizing worldwide after
striking crude oil. Stranger than fiction but closer to truth is the
case of the House of Saud. Unlike the nouveaux riches of the
television fable, the House of Saud has for many decades used its
wealth to spread the most extreme and fundamentalist interpretations
of Islam, intolerant toward all those who do not share its narrow
sectarian Wahhabi creed.</LD>
<LD>   While the Wahhabi sect has been the state-supported religion in
Saudi Arabia since the kingdom was established a century ago, its
influence and reach have been invidious, gradual and largely
unnoticed by the West. Wahhabism had even slipped under the radar
screens of America's scholarly apparatus. One example is Princeton's
eminent Middle East scholar Bernard Lewis, who admitted to Charlie
Rose in a January television interview on PBS that he vastly
underestimated the dangers of Wahhabism: "I hadn't realized its
importance until these last months ... this particular strain of
Islam, which is very far from mainstream ... which suddenly becomes,
if not dominant, at least extremely important."</LD>
<TE>   Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, the sect's founder, was a puritanical
18th century "reformer" who militantly repudiated 1,400 years of
Islamic tradition and culture while seeking to impose a version of
Islam "cleansed" of what he deemed idolatrous and un-Islamic
practices. (Incidentally, Wahhabis do not call themselves Wahhabis
but salafis, or simply faithful Muslims, and accuse anyone using the
term "Wahhabi" of smearing good Muslims with an epithet.) Wahhab also
thought that all Shiites, Sufis and followers of sects of Islam other
than his own were not Muslim. Further, he forbade the celebrations of
the Prophet Muhammad's birthday, the veneration of saints and the
visiting of tombs. But above all, Wahhab and his followers loathed
vocal or instrumental music in all its forms, a point that Stephen
Schwartz, in his book "The Two Faces of Islam: The House of Sa'ud
From Tradition to Terror," finds to be "extremist to the point of
derangement."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz recounts a recent instance of Wahhabi fanaticism, the
story of 15 Saudi girls who perished this year in a schoolhouse fire.
Religious police prevented the girls from leaving the burning school
because they were not shrouded in abayas (black robes) and thus
lacked "Islamic modesty." The girls were beaten back into the school
while anguished parents looked on.</TE>
<TE>   In the holy city of Mecca, the Wahhabis have razed tombs
containing the remains of the family of the Prophet Muhammad. Saudi
religious police guard the leveled sites carrying sticks to beat
pilgrims who are seen praying. It is Saudi Wahhabi aid agencies,
Schwartz notes, that are responsible for the gutting and
"reconstruction" of historic Bosnian mosques and bulldozing of
Kosovar Muslim cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   While tolerant and richly varied forms of Islamic tradition around
the globe were thus zealously eradicated, Saudi Arabia was considered
to be a "vital, moderate" American ally. The foreign policies of
Saudi Arabia and the United States dovetailed from the 1950s through
the 1980s. There are two distinct stages in this sordid love affair:
Until the late 1970s, Saudi Arabia fought the forces of godless
communism by supporting conservative and revolutionary Islamist
organizations as a counterweight to secular and nationalist movements
in the Islamic world. In 1979, twin disasters befell Saudi Arabia:
the Iranian revolution and the Soviet takeover of Afghanistan.
Consequently, the Saudis funded madrasas in Pakistan, proselytizing
the Wahhabi version of Islam to combat the Shiite clerical ascendancy
in Iran, and funded extremist Sunni fundamentalist groups worldwide
to rally what the late political scientist Eqbal Ahmad termed a
"Jihad International" to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Malise Ruthven, in his book "A Fury for God: The Islamist Attack
on America," suggests that Saudi Arabia is the leading exporter not
only of petroleum products but also of fundamentalist Islam. He
argues that the Saudis are able to proselytize effectively not just
because of their oil wealth but also because of their role as
"Custodians of the Two Sanctuaries" (Mecca and Medina), which conveys
upon them religious legitimacy. Wahhabism today is disseminated by
organizations such as the World Muslim League, which was established
by the late Saudi Sheik Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, among the most
reactionary Islamic clerics in the last century. One of Bin Baz's
more memorable rulings concerned the permissibility of women to wear
brassieres (yes, provided there was no attempt at deception). Bin Baz
also lent his moral authority and support to the jihad in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   It is in Afghanistan that Al Qaeda came into being. Ruthven
emphasizes the enormously deleterious role that the anti-Soviet jihad
played in giving rise to violent Islamic militant organizations
across the Muslim world. However, in "Militant Islam Reaches
America," Daniel Pipes argues that this anti-Soviet jihad was a just
one worthy of support. One senses here a Kissingerian moral compass
at work as Pipes strives to justify U.S. backing of fundamentalist
Afghan moujahedeen, and of Saddam Hussein's regime in the past,
because they were fighting America's enemies.</TE>
<TE>   But the rise of Islamic fundamentalism cannot be entirely laid at
the gnarled feet of Wahhabism. Ruthven argues that mid-20th century
Egyptian militant Syed Qutb was the godfather of modern-day militant
Islamism. Qutb, an ideologue of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, laid
the piping for much of what constitutes militant Islamism: the
redefinition of jihad as the overthrowing of secular regimes, the
advocating of the use of force and the revulsion toward secular
"Western" ideals. Ruthven speculates that Qutb may have been strongly
influenced by fascist and Marxist ideologies.</TE>
<TE>   Pipes gives short shrift to the menace of Saudi Wahhabism. One
would think that an author attempting to write a book on the threat
of militant Islam to America after 9/11 might discuss the role of the
desert kingdom in some sustained manner. Many of the essays appearing
in his book are recycled, and their wear shows. Worse, at times Pipes
veers dangerously toward making pernicious generalizations about
Muslims. In references to Bosnia and India, he discusses Islamic
militancy, but he chooses not to mention the slaughter of Muslims at
the hands of religiously inspired non-Muslim extremists. In the case
of Bosnia, Serbian nationalist forces engaged in the genocidal
slaughter and ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Muslims. In India,
anti-Muslim pogroms this year in Gujarat left 1,000 killed and more
than 100,000 displaced at the hands of Hindu fundamentalists. Pipes'
desire to convict Muslims worldwide of fundamentalism blinds him to
their humanity. His book is a shallow polemic masquerading as
informed commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Ruthven's exegesis is all that Pipes' is not. It is a chilling
indictment of Saudi Wahhabism and Saudi-supported fundamentalism
worldwide. More usefully, it is a serious refutation of the
fundamentalist assault against secular values and a brilliant probing
of the psychosocial motivations of its bloody foot soldiers. It is
grim but essential reading.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz's exploration is part polemic and part journalistic
exploration of Wahhabism. Its great advantage is that it also
examines Muslim-Jewish relations, attempting to show that these
peoples that once lived in relative harmony may one day do so again.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi-Wahhabi model of state and society is that of corrupt
princes abroad indulging in the practices their religious police
repress at home. Obstacles to women's equality, democratization,
human rights and freedom of speech have found expression and not
inconsiderable support in the Saudi Arabian theocracy. Along with
oil, these obstacles have been the chief Saudi contribution to the
Muslim world.</TE>

<LD>The Adventures of Lucky Pierre, Directors' Cut, Robert Coover, Grove
Press: 304 pp., $24</LD>
<TE>   Is it a bad sign if there are seven words on the first page of a
novel that you don't exactly know the meanings of (in this case,
"epiodion," "sibilants," "tenebrous," "fricatives," "piangevole,"
"plainchant," "embouchure")? Is it beside the point? In Robert
Coover's case, no. A reader will never feel entirely comfortable
reading a Coover novel, for Coover writes on the verge of
meaninglessness. Coover writes for the mind's eye, cluttering his
pages with images and hypertext and familiar phrases. This is the
place where the loop between irony and cliche is closed or begins
eating itself, like the proverbial serpent and its tail. Other
authors have played with a flow of verbiage, like the babble of
insane shamans, but no other have stopped a reader dead every third
word with images. In "The Adventures of Lucky Pierre," it's the
sexual images, images that can't help but be created as you read.
This is not always pleasant, but writers like Coover, who teaches
electronic and experimental writing at Brown University, work on a
new textual frontier. "Lucky Pierre" is the story of a porn star
living in Cinecity (the city motto is pro bono pubis, famous for a
certain part of his anatomy, sex slave to nine muse-directors who
place him in various roles and call it very high art. There is
absolutely nothing from this novel that can be quoted here. The
thread of the story line is so tenuous that its comprehension depends
more on the reader's imagination than is the case with more
conventional fiction.</TE>

<TE>   The Forgotten Founders: Rethinking the History of the Old West,
Stewart L. Udall, Shearwater/Island Press: 276 pp., $25</TE>
<TE>   Stewart L. Udall, congressman from Arizona from 1954 to 1961,
secretary of the Interior from 1961 to 1969, author and attorney
thereafter, has a new way of looking at the history of the American
West. Where others see conquest, a test of wills between man and
nature, the primitive plundering of the Gold Rush and the violence of
the movie version of the Old West, Udall sees in the stories of
largely unknown individuals a history of cooperation, community
building, loyalty, love for the land and gentleness. Udall looks
first at three Native American cultures -- the Iroquois, the Cherokee
and the Pueblo, then at his own people, the Mormons. Udall's
great-grandfather was John D. Lee, the man who was executed for his
role as a leader in the Mountain Meadow Massacre, a source of great
pain for Udall, who has worked hard to bring the families from the
two parties together and who finally believes that Indians were not
involved with the group of Mormons that murdered the settlers from
Arkansas, as historians have written. He looks finally at the
overblown importance of the California Gold Rush in Western
literature and then at the myth of the trapper as settler (trappers
were by definition nomadic). He wants to "puncture" the old idea of
Manifest Destiny, which argues that the pioneers were "agents of
empire." His is a quiet West, driven more by a need for religious
freedom than by greed.</TE>

<TE>   The Saints of Big Harbour, Lynn Coady, Houghton Mifflin: 328 pp.,

<TE>   Guy Boucher, a fatherless teenager from the boondocks of Nova
Scotia, is surrounded by idiots: his alcoholic Uncle Isadore, a big
man, a hero in his own mind, who wants to make a real man out of Guy
(which makes Uncle Isadore an excellent hockey coach); a
draft-dodging English professor (never has the book "Flowers for
Algernon" seemed so beside the point); a mother who makes a living
caring for other people's children while her own play hooky; and
various confused teenagers. One of them, Corrine, the town's
sweetheart, starts a rumor about Guy that turns an otherwise
hilarious novel (in the style of Scottish writer Magnus Mills) into a
potential tragedy. Few authors capture a rural teenager's voice as
successfully as Lynn Coady does. Feckless Guy is my hero.</TE>

<BD>Clancy Sigal, a screenwriter, is the author of "Going
Away" and "The Secret Defector."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sam Fuller's gloriously robust memoir is the inspirational book of
the year, if not decade, for anyone even remotely connected to the
film business. His life story, told in the punchy tabloid prose he
learned as a 16-year-old crime reporter covering suicides and
executions for the New York Graphic, a lurid sex-and-scandal sheet,
seizes you by the scruff and flings you headlong into his harsh,
funny, violent universe of independent filmmaking on the far edge of
a bygone Hollywood where deals were consummated by a handshake, not a
studio lawyer's 1,000-page small-print contract.</LD>
<LD>   This posthumously published autobiography -- Fuller died five
years ago and it took nearly that long for the manuscript and the
tapes he left behind to be edited and transcribed -- is not a how-to,
yet somehow you learn more from it about how to make good movies than
in almost all the technical cinema texts I have read. Sam Fuller --
his father's birth name was Rabinovitch -- is a good teacher because
he had guts, passion, anarchic emotions under the strict control of
tough deadlines and a true lover's addiction to film. Holy cow! -- to
use one of his favorite expressions -- what a read, what a ride.</LD>
<TE>   At the very least, Fuller's story -- his yarn, as he liked to say
-- should help us seriously reconsider some of his best films. Such
as his masterpiece, "The Big Red One," his Korean War-era movies "The
Steel Helmet" and "Fixed Bayonets," the searing, satiric Cold War
drama "Pickup on South Street" and his quirky westerns, including the
phallus-ridden "Forty Guns."</TE>
<TE>   In a way, his memoir is an impassioned love letter to an
up-and-coming generation of filmmakers. He had a special fondness for
young filmmakers such as Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch, Jean-Luc Godard,
Francois Truffaut and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, who all adored his
work and attached themselves to him, especially during his 13-year
exile in Europe. (Martin Scorsese has written the memoir's
introduction.) In his characteristic growl, Fuller talks directly to
novices. "You young people sitting around watching ... television!
Get off your asses and go see the world!"</TE>
<TE>   Yet there's hardly a false or self-pitying or retributive note in
his book. The man was in love with life, with movies and with telling
the gutter truth as he saw it. And because of his background as a
crime reporter and later as a virtually geriatric infantryman (at 31)
with the combat-decimated "The Big Red One" division, his truth could
be ugly, vicious, short, sharp and brutal. At the same time, he pays
generous tribute to old-line producers, such as Darryl Zanuck, Bob
Lippert and Jack Warner, who gave Fuller such latitude on some very
strange projects. Perhaps it was because he worked fast and under
budget -- and carried a loaded Luger pistol, which he fired instead
of shouting "Action!"</TE>
<TE>   Fuller worked as a tabloid reporter in the 1930s when "tabloid"
wasn't a dirty word, merely the New York Times written in street
vernacular. Over and over again he urges young directors: " ... seize
your audience ... as soon as the credits hit the screen ... ! Smack
people right in the face with the passion of your story!"</TE>
<TE>   In outrageously over-the-top movies like "Shock Corridor" and "The
Naked Kiss," he opposed -- with his kick-'em-in-the-gut screenplays,
choice of camera angles and near-anonymous casting -- the prevailing
sentimentality of most Hollywood product. When Howard Hawks asked him
to direct Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises," Sam Fuller lost the job
by insisting that the film open with the hero lying naked on an
operating table as the surgeon drops his sawed-off testicle in a tin
cup. Take that, "Three Coins in the Fountain"!</TE>
<TE>   Fuller's whole life is a study in the strategies of a scrappy
"peewee" kid from a poor family -- his widowed mother raised seven
children on almost no money -- thrown into the reasonless chaos of a
merciless Depression-soiled adult world. He sold newspapers on street
corners, joined hobos in boxcars, chummed with whores and murderers,
hustled and muscled -- and wrote -- his way out of poverty. Pulp
fiction was his metier; he wrote a dozen down-market novels before
being lured to Hollywood by older journalists who waved their big fat
checks in front of Fuller's dazzled eyes.</TE>
<TE>   In post-World War II Hollywood, Fuller was one of the very few
with battlefield experience. Miraculously, he had come out of the war
("the greatest crime story of the century") alive, with a bullet in
his chest and a Silver Star for gallantry. He endured combat in North
Africa, Sicily, the Normandy landing on D-day all the way through the
French hedgerows and wild-dog Nazi resistance inside Germany. Somehow
he stayed sane, buoyed by a gift for survival he would need to play,
and buck, the Hollywood system. Part of this talent lay in his choice
of mentors, or what he calls "father figures": the great popular
newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, director John Ford, even colonels
and generals in the Army who befriended him.</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, Fuller's story comes back to front-line combat.
He is intensely honored to have served in the mud and snow, to have
survived the American army debacle at North Africa's Kasserine Pass,
Anzio, the Battle of the Bulge and the horror of stumbling onto
Falkenau concentration camp in Germany. He came out of the war's
"everyday lunacy" tougher, harder, even more unsparing of himself.
But so proud. Pride -- in an old-fashioned, almost Victorian sense --
in work, life, in himself shines through every page of his memoir. As
he might say, it jumps out from the page and grabs you.</TE>
<TE>   It helped that he had relentless physical energy. Well into his
60s, as an actor in a Wim Wenders thriller ("The American Friend"),
he wanted to do his own stunt: falling from a speeding train. At 80
he and independent filmmaker Jim Jarmusch paddled a dugout canoe into
Brazil's Mato Grosso jungle where 50 years before he had tried to
make a movie among the Karaja native peoples.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologically, Fuller was "under fire" all his life. But he
followed the good infantryman's rule to push on because running away
from the enemy is more likely to get you killed. With more than 100
movie titles registered with the Writers Guild, a huge number of
movies he either made, wrote or acted in, published novels and unmade
scripts galore, he was inexorable, unbribable, unregenerate in his
odd, twisted, dark, stoic and funny personal obsessions. And how is
this for advice to any of us tempted by the fake expediency of
showbiz?</TE>
<TE>   "Even when things looked really bleak, I remained optimistic,
excited by the yarns I was working on. One of the tricks I've learned
is to tap constantly into my creative juices, no matter whether
there's a producer to finance the movie or not. When you're least
suspecting it, one'll show up. You damn well better be ready to pull
a script you really love out of your desk drawer."</TE>
<TE>   The operative words are "really love." He did a few hack films, to
which he freely confesses, but for most of his creative life he
wormed his way under and through the barbed wire of the studio
financing system like the agile rifleman he'd once been. For more
than 30 years his heart was set on only one project, the
semiautobiographical World War II "The Big Red One." This picture,
virtually starless (like most Fuller films) except for Lee Marvin as
the sergeant, grows the more I watch it even in its present
chopped-up one hour-plus version on TV. (Originally it ran to 4 hours
and 20 minutes.)</TE>
<TE>   In my opinion, "The Big Red One," with its mixture of routine
cruelty and offhand compassion, is the best of all war movies. His
story of a small squad of young infantrymen learning their killing
trade is a sobering antidote to the triumphalism, implied or
explicit, of Tom Brokaw's "greatest generation" and "realistic"
battle movies like "Saving Private Ryan."</TE>
<TE>   When all of Fuller's self-mythologizing and James Cagney-like
tough guy act are put aside, what remains is a cold fury at war. He
hates the patriotic sentimentality of John Wayne movies, " ... when
some officer invariably says, 'These men have given their lives for
their country.' ... They didn't give their lives. Their lives were
taken away. They were robbed." If it is possible to be an
anti-fascist, democratic, war-inspired antiwar peacenik Old Soldier,
Fuller fits the bill.</TE>
<TE>   When for five long years Fuller couldn't get arrested in Hollywood
or make a film, the Europeans discovered him, to his vast amusement
and secret pleasure. French critics and audiences especially went
wild over almost everything he had done. Jean-Luc Godard called
"Shock Corridor" a "masterpiece of barbarian cinema." "I didn't know
what the hell that meant, but I was happy if it sold tickets," Fuller
says with a tinge of the false naivete that he sometimes lapses into.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, although self-educated -- he was expelled from high
school for faking a student "orgy" for his scandal newspaper -- he
was erudite cinematically and in world literature. Put him in front
of his battered old Royal typewriter, shove a cigar in his mouth, and
Fuller would "crank out" a cheapo yarn about redemption, sacrifice,
love and betrayal to rival, or surpass, far more prestigious Academy
Award bores of his contemporaries. He might title it "I Shot Jesse
James" or "Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street," but the elemental
emotions would be descended from Shakespeare or Chaucer.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller died in 1997, shortly after dictating this memoir with the
help of his wife, Christa Lang, and Jerome Henry Rudes, founder of
the Avignon Film Festival. His last words are, again, for young film
lovers. "Okay, all you new voices, let yourself be heard!"</TE>

<HD>A parable of greed, written in wine</HD>
<DH>The Far Side of Eden: New Money, Old Land, and the Battle
for Napa Valley, James Conaway, Houghton Mifflin: 366 pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenyon Webster</AU>
<BD>Kenyon Webster is an urban planner in Sonoma County.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wine Country. Its mystique has captivated California from Santa
Barbara to San Luis Obispo to Sonoma, Mendocino and, most notably,
Napa, the epicenter of the state's wine industry. But this growth has
not come without a price. The extraordinary accomplishment, greed,
environmental destruction and political upheaval in the Napa Valley
wine industry of the 1990s is a parable for an America that often
destroys the landscapes it loves through wanton exploitation at the
expense of the public good and of the forces of reaction, at times
misguided, which have sought to protect that natural landscape.</LD>
<LD>   James Conaway's "The Far Side of Eden" continues the chronicle of
Napa Valley's evolution from a sleepy agricultural backwater to a
land of international conglomerates, dilettante millionaire
investors, gentleman farmers and aggressive resistance to
environmental protection that Conaway began in "Napa: The Story of an
American Eden," an account of the struggles of the early grape
growers and winemakers in the Northern California county from the
1960s through the '80s.</LD>
<TE>   Napa's eminence in the world of wine crystallized in 1976, when,
in a blind taste test by French experts, wines from Napa bested some
of the most renowned (read: French) names -- an extraordinary
embarrassment to that country's wine establishment. The cachet of
owning a Napa "estate" vineyard, of having one's own label and
becoming part of the American wine aristocracy, blossomed from that
singular triumph.</TE>
<TE>   But along with rampant growth in the industry came problems. Napa
County in the 1990s was the scene of epic struggles between
environmentalists and growers, entrepreneurs and wealthy investors
who resisted environmental regulation and, indeed, any other controls
on their land and development. Rampant destruction of hillsides,
bulldozing of oak woodlands, siltation of streams and hordes of
tourists brought calls for government intervention and regulation
from environmentalists and ordinary citizens. As described by
Conaway, this led to a polarization of those whose natural interests
should have coincided: grape growers who wanted to preserve
agriculture and activists who wanted to protect the environment.
Those who sought balance were derided by extremists in both camps.</TE>
<TE>   While winemakers, ordinary citizens, politicians and bureaucrats
debated the future of Napa County, others, eager for celebrity as
superstar consultants or purveyors of $100 bottles of "rocket juice,"
pursued status and profit no matter what the cost to the community.</TE>
<TE>   It was against this backdrop that the Sierra Club, with the
backing of a wealthy, eccentric local postmaster, sponsored a lawsuit
against Napa County for violating the California Environmental
Quality Act. Napa County was a leader in creating grading standards
to address soil erosion and runoff on steep vineyard sites.
Ironically, the county's permit requirements created the opportunity
for a legal challenge alleging that individual environmental reviews
should have been conducted on each permit. The Sierra Club won,
scoring a major tactical victory, but the club failed to capitalize
on larger policy issues and opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Repercussions of the lawsuit were felt beyond Napa County.
Supervisors in nearby Sonoma County, facing similar vineyard
development protests, restructured their proposed vineyard grading
ordinance to eliminate the possibility of the type of legal attack
experienced in Napa. This approach precluded the imposition of
conditions tailored to the unique circumstances of each project,
lessening the effectiveness of the regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The book stays locally focused but is a microcosm of the battles
being waged at the grass-roots level all across California. While the
shortfalls of developing policy by lawsuit are illustrated and the
value of hard lines between urban development and agriculture through
the creation of agricultural preserve zones is articulated, Conaway
does not draw broader lessons regarding the need for strong statewide
policies that balance resource protection with economic development
and preservation of agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide planning to limit unchecked sprawl, implement an
effective system of mass transit and preserve prime agricultural and
natural areas has been lacking in California, leaving cities and
counties to their own devices. Given the ethos of private property
rights, unfettered capitalism and a strong history of local control,
there is, of course, little prospect of such a statewide vision being
implemented.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does Conaway explore the fiscal dynamics behind the county's
allowances for high-end hotels and Disneyland-like wineries,
epitomized by Francis Ford Coppola's Niebaum-Coppola winery,
marketing everything from yo-yos to $85 espresso cups in a setting
crammed with artifacts from the director's Hollywood career and
catering to busloads of tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Conaway, who has written a diverse range of nonfiction and
fiction, opts for an understated style. His chronicle lets the
players speak for themselves, revealing their follies, pains and
aspirations. In the end, the future of Napa County, and other
precious areas of California, will be written by their likes, for
better or for worse.</TE>

<LD>"They say if it rains at a theater opening, it's good luck -- but I
think we've overdone it," said Julianne Argyros as she stood in the
spotlight at the new South Coast Repertory stage named in her honor.
With that, Argyros -- wife of U.S. Ambassador to Spain George Argyros
-- yanked a glittering gold cord and watched the scarlet-hued
curtains part on the world premiere of New York playwright Richard
Greenberg's "The Violet Hour."</LD>
<LD>   Minutes before, about 200 theater buffs dodged a pelting rain as
they flew across a parkway from the Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel in
Costa Mesa. There, they had dined on roast veal and purple potatoes
(a culinary nod to "The Violet Hour" -- "that New York hour when the
evening is about to reward you for the day," says one of the play's
characters) in celebration of the 336-seat Julianne Argyros Stage.
"We are delighted to be here in Orange County -- and what a great
county we have," said George Argyros, who, with his wife, has donated
upward of $5 million to South Coast Rep. Praising the company at the
Nov. 8 gala, Ben Cameron, executive director of Theatre
Communications Group, which supports regional theaters across the
country, called it "the crown jewel of the California theater scene."</LD>

<HD>Tied by music and murder</HD>
<DH>Enemies in court now find common ground in a record label.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>The tale of the rapper and the prosecutor is a twisted one now, bent
into strange shapes by scandal, celebrity and murder music, but once
it was a story of straight lines and simple roles.</LD>
<LD>   When they first met in 1994, the rapper, Anerae Brown, was one of
four gang members on trial for a spasm of early-morning violence that
had left a grandmother dead in her home. The button-down Pete Harned
was the star of the Sacramento County district attorney's office and
savvy enough to know that he would win convictions if he could put
the 17-year-old rapper's lurid music on trial as well.</LD>
<LD>   The judge allowed Harned to play Brown's music twice in court. The
music, recorded under the stage name X-Raided, was brash, explicit
and relentlessly violent. In one especially damning line, Brown
declared he would be "kicking down doors" and "killin' mommas."
Harned argued that this was practically a prediction of the slaying
of Patricia Harris. The community activist had been shot through the
heart in March 1992 when gang members stormed her home searching for
rivals, and police said Brown was the ringleader. When the music was
played in court, Harned was confident he read victory in the jury's
horror.</LD>
<TE>   The trial had been a complex one with a separate jury for each of
the defendants, but finally, four years after the crime and his
arrest, the verdict came back guilty for X-Raided. The rapper was
shuttled off to prison and, presumably, a 31-year sentence of
obscurity and heartache. Harned buckled his briefcase on a key career
victory and embraced Harris' relatives. The epic length of the case
had left the family fuming, and they viewed Harned as their lone
crusader in the legal system.</TE>
<TE>   There was no reason for Harned to think he would ever see X-Raided
again. But four years later, a letter with a prison postmark
reconnected them in a way that would stun the Harris family if they
had known.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 28-year-old Brown sits in Corcoran State Prison and
fills his hours and notebooks with rhymes of gang life. His music is
no idle handiwork. Despite the efforts of his jailers and the
California attorney general, Brown while behind bars has managed to
covertly record and release nine albums, the most recent in July. The
modest sales make him unknown to most music fans, but X-Raided is an
underground hero to some and a celebrity of the prison yard. "The
music," he says, "takes me over these walls."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the inmate may enjoy more freedom than the man who
prosecuted him.</TE>
<TE>   Harned is no longer a prosecutor; he lost that beloved job amid
scandal. He restarted his career as a defense attorney in a sad
closet of an office located one right turn away from the offices of
the Sacramento district attorney. He spends his days now defending
accused killers and robbers, but two years ago he quietly began a
side project in business law, specifically the music industry. In his
moonlighting role, he has one client: X-Raided, the rapper and
murderer. The attorney even has an X-Raided CD perched beside his law
books."I just can't stand rap music and I don't have to listen to the
stuff to work with it," the attorney said. "But I had to put it
there. Isn't that something? I'm so proud of him."</TE>
<TE>   For a man six years into a 31-year sentence, Anerae Veshaughn
Brown gets around: Folsom, Salinas Valley, Mule Creek and, the latest
state prison, Corcoran, north of Bakersfield. "They keep moving me
because they say I cause trouble," he said in an interview just
before his move last year to Corcoran. "I disagree. Trouble causes
me."</TE>
<TE>   Brown chuckled and squinted in the sun beating down on Mule
Creek's outdoor visiting area. It's air-conditioned inside, but also
as noisy as a middle school cafeteria, so prisoners looking for quiet
conversation with their girlfriends and wives sweat outside in their
starched denim. The couples hold hands and pace the fenced perimeter
in slow procession.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has rounded features and a certain shyness. He seems far
removed from the scowling young man who insisted on testifying at his
own trial and defiantly said, yes, he was a violent gang member and,
yes, he was proud of it. (Said Harned, with a smile: "He was speaking
honestly, at least, but I don't think it was necessarily a wise
course of action.") He hopes his music will fund his freedom. "Money
speeds up everything. I want my albums to make enough to pay Johnnie
Cochran or an affiliate of his to help me. I just need to get my
music out there. I'll be the biggest story in hip-hop."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about his latest work, X-Raided knitted his eyes, bobbed his
head to a beat no one else could hear and began rhyming:</TE>
<TE>   Might survive with black eyes and torn clothes</TE>
<TE>   Or meet my end in the pen, servin' a sentence for sins committed</TE>
<TE>   If I lose my soul I'll send my men to get it</TE>
<TE>   Never break the law again, player, but I intend to bend it</TE>
<TE>   Behind him, some of the Mule Creek couples paused in curiosity,
and one inmate with an iron cross tattoo sneered. If the rapper
noticed, he gave no sign. Brown's total of 10 albums have combined to
sell 309,000 copies in the U.S., according to SoundScan, which is
more than many artists but less than, say, Eminem sells in an average
week. He is not rich, but his music has earned him more than $100,000
while behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   He was only 16 when he finished his first recording, an
underground project with Sacramento rapper Brotha Lynch Hung, and he
was signed within a year to an independent label in Northern
California. His first solo work, "Psycho Active" in 1992, created a
buzz in south Sacramento that a gifted new rapper was claiming the
Crips as his gang affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   The cover of "Psycho Active" shows Brown's face with a .38-caliber
handgun pressed to his temple. The follow-up album a year later was
made inside the Sacramento County jail and recorded over phone lines
as Brown awaited trial for the Harris murder. That audacity inspired
a frenzy of local media coverage and outrage.</TE>
<TE>   The Harris murder had already been big news in Sacramento, which
still fancied itself immune to big-city street crime. Harris, 42, was
gunned down in March 1992 in what appeared to be a botched attempt by
gang members to shoot her two sons. To many, the crime signaled the
importation of Los Angeles gang woes to the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We hadn't had that many gang shootings and there was a lot of
concern about retaliation," Harned said. "This was a big deal. They
had metal detectors set up in the courthouse and sheriff's snipers on
the roof. Gang killings are garden-variety nowadays, but not then."</TE>
<TE>   A slaying, then arrests</TE>
<TE>   It had all started with boys shouting in the night outside the
Harris home in Meadowview, a neighborhood in south Sacramento. A
drowsy Harris padded to the door. The voices out front identified
themselves as police officers -- a sly strategy to confuse their
quarry, two of the Harris sons, reputed members of the Meadowview
Bloods.</TE>
<TE>   The hinges buckled, the door was kicked in and the boys tumbled
into the darkened home. In the chaos, a gunshot caught Harris in the
heart. The arrests came within days. Five suspects, 15 to 17, all
members of the Crips. X-Raided was joined by Skooby, Scrappy, Little
Bread and Baby Snake -- their nicknames were probably meant to make
them sound streetwise but had the opposite effect. Police said the
attack was a reprisal for the deaths of two members of the 29th
Street Crips. The youngest among the Crips war party would testify
that the raid was engineered by X-Raided, their leader and
charismatic neighborhood celebrity.</TE>
<TE>   "Mastermind, that's what they said I was," Brown said. "They took
turns during the trial. Either I was an idiot or I was a mastermind."</TE>
<TE>   To Det. Aldert Robinson, a 25-year veteran of the Sacramento
police force, what X-Raided really was that fateful night was a
poseur in over his head. He said wearily, "There were a lot of kids
up here trying to act like they knew what they were doing."</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, L.A.-area gang members were migrating north,
many of them youngsters dispatched by families hoping to give them a
fresh start. Instead, the newcomers often were the kingfish teaching
their old ways to eager novices. X-Raided was one of those novices.</TE>
<TE>   "Brown was an up-and-coming rapper trying to make some music,"
Robinson said. "During those days, that's when gangsta rap was really
starting to take off, and a lot of these guys decided that maybe you
had to be involved in what you were rapping about to give yourself
some legitimacy. Walk the walk."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's mother, Shirley "Jaz" Brown, says her son was a bright
youngster always jotting in his notebooks. He was schooled at home,
where R&amp;B was always around and his dad was not. Rap became his
passion, and as his reputation grew, his mother sensed something was
going wrong. She wanted him to join her for a much-needed vacation in
March 1992, but then let him stay in Sacramento because he had a
party celebrating a new single.</TE>
<TE>   Jaz Brown was having a bad dream at her aunt's home in Waco,
Texas, when the phone rang. The caller wouldn't identify himself, but
he demanded to know who Jaz was and whom she knew in Sacramento.
Later, she learned the call had come from the home of Patricia Harris
while the woman's blood was still on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives later explained that they found a Texas phone number on
a scrap left at the crime scene. It would be a key link to X-Raided.
"In the dream I had that night, there were all these people running,
and they were telling me to come on, to hurry, there was danger," Jaz
Brown says. "But I kept dropping everything and falling. There was
nothing I could do."</TE>
<TE>   Before the murder, Jaz Brown was a clerk at the Sacramento County
Courthouse, but she quit when X-Raided became a famous defendant in
the corridors. By June 2000, Jaz Brown had a new title, CEO of Madman
Records, the new label for X-Raided and other rappers. She ran the
business from a tidy Sacramento apartment, but its true command
center was her son's cell.</TE>
<TE>   The rapper himself was merely a "consultant," and with good
reason. A year earlier, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's office had sued
X-Raided under the Son of Sam law in an attempt to seize his music
profits and set them aside for the family of his victim. "This
album," Lockyer said, "is a simple attempt by a criminal with
marginal talent to cash in on a murderous past."</TE>
<TE>   But the Son of Sam case against X-Raided stalled and the
California Supreme Court later struck down the law. Still, in 2000,
the rapper was not about to take chances with his money. He also
brought in some professional help to set up the business. The man for
the job, he decided, was an old rival.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, the prosecutor.... It's twisted, I know that, it sounds
twisted," X-Raided said. "But I like it twisted. Everything is
strange. But that may be the strangest thing of all."</TE>
<TE>   Recording at prison</TE>
<TE>   The only truly bankable asset for Madman Records was a stack of
digitally recorded discs, the master recordings of more than 150
X-Raided songs. The storehouse includes enough unreleased material
for three or more albums. On a typical one is the voice of the
rapper, sitting in his cell: "All right now, I'm about to give you
the hook. First I'll give you one verse on how the hook is said and
then I'll give you the second and you can put them on top. So it's
the first and the overdub. Here we go...."</TE>
<TE>   The recordings were made at Salinas Valley State Prison. The
rapper was unhappy with the sound quality of his first album as an
inmate, the one recorded over the phone, and his second, done on
cassette tape, was not much better. But at Salinas Valley in 1998,
X-Raided finally found his voice.</TE>
<TE>   The rapper says a guard approached him and struck up a friendship
that created a pipeline. "He was adamant that he wanted to help me,"
Brown said. "He was like a little kid, all excited." The guard
delivered a digital recorder and the rapper went to work.</TE>
<TE>   The guard smuggled the discs to Brown's label at the time, Black
Market Records, and, with studio work, the finished product was
ready. "But the guard, he made a mistake," X-Raided said. "I gave him
a letter to hand someone on the outside. He left it with his paycheck
sitting in a control booth where someone else saw it. That crossed
everybody up."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Corrections confirms that a guard was
fired for smuggling contraband to Brown. Richard Subia, public
information officer for Mule Creek State Prison, said that since
then, prisoner No. K17737 has been monitored at every facility to
prevent a repeat of the embarrassing Salinas Valley episode. "We have
an eye toward that now," Subia said. "That was an isolated incident."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the rapper describes himself as a restless artist, waking
in the night to scribble rhymes. He is evasive on plans to record
more music, but the grin that accompanies his "no comment" speaks
volumes. He ends the conversation playfully: "Maybe you should talk
to my attorney about that."</TE>
<TE>   Delays in complex case</TE>
<TE>   Pete Harned is a Nat King Cole fan. To him, rap is a torrent of
ugly words delivered in a foreign language. But when he was tapped
for the Harris murder case, he steeled himself and listened to every
X-Raided song. A track called "Tha Murder" is the one that caught his
ear.</TE>
<TE>   In "Tha Murder," X-Raided raps that he will stop at nothing to
hunt down his rivals, and that he will smash through doors and kill
their relatives. The song was so eerily on point that the judge
agreed to let jurors hear it twice during the trial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Sacramento, so you've got mostly a white-ish, middle-class
jury and they were clearly offended by it," Harned said. "Your
average middle-aged postal worker from Citrus Heights doesn't hear
that every day. I don't think they convicted him because he wrote
such a song, but it was a very effective piece of the puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   The Harris murder seemed like it might never be resolved in court.
Each defendant had a court-appointed defender already dealing with a
mountain of work, and the original prosecutor had transferred to his
agency's juvenile division after working on the case for two years.
His replacement was Harned, who was determined to give the Harris
family some resolution.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest of the five arrested suspects had pleaded guilty to
ensure he would be tried as a juvenile, and he agreed to testify
against his cohorts, who would all be tried as adults. Each defendant
had a separate jury. Christopher McKinnie and Roosevelt Jermaine
Coleman were accused as accomplices, Brown and the remaining suspect,
Samuel Maurice Proctor, were tried as the triggermen.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, three were found guilty on murder and murder
conspiracy charges, and given life sentences. Proctor was acquitted.
The Harris family was distressed to see anyone go free but happy to
see the case end, finally. Four years had passed between the arrests
and the final verdict.</TE>
<TE>   X-Raided now says he did not testify about what really happened
the night of the Harris murder because he adhered to the gang code of
silence. "I could have testified and gone home," the rapper said.
"But I kept it real." He says he was present at the attack but did
not pull the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   For Harned, closing the case built on a successful law-and-order
career that began with a high school job as a clerk typist at the
state Department of Justice. By the time he graduated from Cal State
Sacramento, he was working in the state agency's Bureau of Organized
Crime. In December 1985, he had a law degree following night classes
at Lincoln Law School, and a post in the district attorney's office
of his hometown.</TE>
<TE>   By 1996, he was one of the prosecutors who handled capital cases
for the agency's homicide team and also prosecuted sex crime cases.
He was a top gun, a genial workaholic known to friends and rivals
alike as a candid but friendly voice; a judicial appointment was seen
in the future. Then, on a summer morning in 1996, his computer
crashed and his life's work went with it.</TE>
<TE>   The repairman who pried open Harned's home computer reported to
police that he found a CD-ROM inside with images of child
pornography. The scandal quickly bloomed, and Harned was fired and
charged criminally, a golden boy turned pariah. "My untimely demise,"
he says with a practiced casualness. "I've never been bitter. I've
been unhappy about the way it turned out. I loved the office, I loved
the people there."</TE>
<TE>   Harned explains it like this: He ordered a CD-ROM from the
Netherlands with hundreds of erotic images of young men. Among those
images were models under 18, but Harned insists he was oblivious to
that. Harned had never made it a secret that he was gay, but neither
had he made it a visible part of his work life. Now he found himself
explaining his private life and, more pressing, defending himself
from criminal charges that might land him in prison for 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   As he had so many times before, Harned won in the courtroom. A
judge ruled that the detective who secured a search warrant for
Harned's home had misrepresented the disc's content, both in the
amount he viewed and in the nature of its explicit content. The
charges were dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Harned retained his license to practice law, but the episode cost
him more than a few friends. One day in 2000, though, Harned found a
surprising new one in the morning mail. "I got a letter from Anerae
Brown. He said he saw on TV news what had happened. He wanted to tell
me to stay strong and that he knew I would be OK. I could not have
been more stunned."</TE>
<TE>   The rapper explains that he respected the prosecutor's strength
and appreciated that during the murder trail, Harned's attacks were
damaging but never seemed personal. The correspondence between the
unlikely pair continued, and then, when Brown left Black Market
Records to start Madman, he asked Harned to handle the paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   "My answer was no for a variety of reasons," Harned said. "It
seemed more than a little strange. It is not an area in which I'm
professionally trained. I've always worked in criminal law. But what
bothered me most was my previous relationship with him. I explained
to him very clearly that this would look very unusual to a lot of
people and raise a lot of eyebrows."</TE>
<TE>   Brown answered that Harned was the only attorney he trusted. That
was enough for the disgraced prosecutor. "I cannot afford, morally,
to judge my clients. I can't decide if they are morally bankrupt or
evil or good or bad. I am not a moral arbiter. I am a lawyer. If I
took only good decent people who did no wrong, these doors would be
shuttered, I guarantee you."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Harned, now 43, admits that the faces of the Harris family
flashed through his mind. When told that the family will be finding
out very soon, the attorney looked like he was waiting for a jury to
return a verdict. "If you speak to them," he tells his visitor, "can
you let me know what they say?"</TE>
<TE>   Agonizing memories</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Harris has been reduced to a name in archived court
documents, but the closer you get to her home, the more powerful her
memory lives. The people remember her, said Betty Scroggins, a
volunteer at Meadowview Community Center where Harris was a fixture.
"There was a lot of pain at her loss," she said. "As for the one who
did it, and the thing he does, well, I'd rather not comment on that."</TE>
<TE>   The front door of the Harris home shows no sign of the violence
that took place a decade ago, but the man who opens it is not far
removed from that painful night. William C. Harris was married for 25
years, but he was not home the night his wife was taken away.</TE>
<TE>   "The first two or three years it was an illness," he said. "My
mind would get bad."</TE>
<TE>   Moving slow, he walks through his home mapping out the madness of
that 1992 night. "She came all the way to here, that's when they shot
her," he said pointing to a spot near the living room. Then he points
again, to a spot beneath a framed copy of the Lord's Prayer. "They
found the splashes of blood on the wall, there."</TE>
<TE>   As the grim tour ends, William Harris points down the hall that is
off-limits to visitors. "They found her in the bedroom. She crawled
all the way back. That's what bothered me. She wanted help. She was
dying, in a panic. She wanted help. And there was no help. I wasn't
here. I was lost in my guilt."</TE>
<TE>   William Harris is willing to talk, but he's not sure what to say.
He offers snapshots, real and remembered, of his lost wife. He was a
young saxophone player from Stockton working in R&amp;B clubs and she was
the sister of a singer. She was 17 when they married. Through the
years, she worked with the PTA, had five kids and, at the time of her
death, 11 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The widower rarely leaves home. He has a hard time sleeping in
their bedroom. The kids are gone now, moved out, and he says he is of
little good to them. "I taught them life is a minefield," he says,
"and it's stacked against you."</TE>
<TE>   He spends his hours toiling on a community newsletter. The content
is political and feisty, a transcript of a talk show in his head. One
issue has a blurry photo of man with a gun pressed to his head --
it's the cover of X-Raided's first album. The adjacent essay is about
black-on-black crime. There is no identification of the man in the
picture, no mention of his role in the essayist's life. The hazy
image is, like the crime, inseparable from the life of William
Harris, but defies explanation or even acknowledgment.</TE>
<TE>   When X-Raided was on trial, Harris accused him of killing purely
to promote a rap career. Later, when the albums recorded in prison
were released, the widower lashed out publicly at the injustice of it
all. Now, though, his rage is seeping away.</TE>
<TE>   Harris did not know Harned was working for X-Raided. When told, he
paused for a long moment and then shook his head. "I don't know what
to say about that. Harned did all right by us. But I don't understand
that. There's a lot I don't understand anymore." He seems to want to
say more, but instead he shrugs and guides the visitor back past the
crime scene and out the door.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Harned accepted that vague verdict. Then he changed the
subject to the future. X-Raided wants to set up a new label, Gangway
Records, and minimize the role of Madman and Jaz Brown (instead of
minding the money, a frustrated X-Raided said, she mothered the acts,
lining up personal finance or anger management classes for them).
Harned's role, if any, is uncertain. Last week, he said that if
Gangway gets off the ground, he might consider an in-house job as an
executive.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been one to rule things out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And what of X-Raided's dream of cashing in with his rap and hiring
a hotshot defense attorney for an appeal -- did Harned's new
friendship with his onetime quarry persuade him that the rapper might
have been wrongly convicted? "We've never really discussed it, but
no," Harned said, suddenly sounding like a prosecutor back in a world
with sure footing and straight lines. "He did it. He's guilty. It was
a good case."</TE>

<DH>Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton
and Pierce Brosnan: 007s who've saved the world in her majesty's
service.</DH>

<LD>For 40 years, the suave British secret agent has been a cultural
icon, ever since Sean Connery first burst on the screen like a sexual
panther in "Dr. No" and identified himself as "Bond, James Bond."
With his license to kill, dry martinis and easy way with women and
gadgets, 007 has epitomized an ultimate male fantasy, transcending
novelist Ian Fleming's Cold War superspy.</LD>
<LD>   Although the world has changed considerably since, Bond remains
the same no matter who plays him -- because that's the way we want
it.</LD>
<LD>   So expect something old, something new, something borrowed but
nothing blue when "Die Another Day," the multibillion-dollar
franchise's 20th feature film (not counting a couple of "unofficial"
installments), opens Friday, with Pierce Brosnan.</LD>
<TE>   For many people, Connery is the best, the only Bond. He discussed
the legend he created by phone from Prague, Czech Republic, where
he's shooting "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen." Once Connery
took the lead, his successors gladly stepped forward: George Lazenby,
the Australian model who injected a rare dose of humanity in "On Her
Majesty's Secret Service" (1969) before heading off into obscurity;
Roger Moore, who gamely hung around for a record seven films in the
'70s and '80s with a decidedly more ridiculous approach; Timothy
Dalton, the Royal Shakespeare Company alumnus who returned 007 to
novelist Ian Fleming's gritty roots with only moderate success in
"The Living Daylights" (1987) and "Licence to Kill" (1989); and
Brosnan, who has chalked up four appearances and counting.</TE>
<TE>   In his wildest dreams, though, did Connery ever think Bond would
last this long?</TE>
<TE>   "No, I didn't. And anyone who says he did is a liar." The Oscar
winner suggests the timing of "Dr. No" in 1962 was perfect, and it
didn't hurt that President John F. Kennedy proclaimed "From Russia
With Love" was his favorite novel. "They broke away from the
kitchen-sink dramas" in Britain, he adds. "The initial Bonds were
refreshing, exciting and funny, and had good stories and pretty
girls--a certain kind of style that didn't take anything for granted,
although 'Dr. No' only cost a million."</TE>
<TE>   Connery, 72, who says he wouldn't mind playing a Bond villain if
the price was right, credits the first director, Terence Young, with
defining the sleek and sensual style, and shaping his cool and
confident performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Terence was a real bon vivant. He got me a rack of clothes and,
as they say, could get me to look convincingly dangerous in the act
of playing it. The humor was an added element lacking in the novels.
I took it seriously on one level. One had to be menacing, one had to
be strong enough to do all this stuff. Or seem old enough to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the first three films were fun (he cites 1963's "From
Russia With Love" as the best), Connery became increasingly
disenchanted with fights over salary and partnership, outrageous
sci-fi plots and demanding production schedules. He officially
retired his license to kill after six smash outings and has watched
only bits and pieces of his successors on TV. "One wound up doing
less and less, as it were. And the other thing was that they were
always committing to an opening before they had a script ready, which
is rather like the studios do now."</TE>
<TE>   "Working very hard to make it look easy" may have been Connery's
secret, but it was too great a burden for newcomer Lazenby, who was
unprepared for Bondage and a departure from the franchise formula. "I
was hooked on the films and had nothing to lose -- I think that in
part gave me the drive to become James Bond," he opined in Los
Angeles, where he plays a lot of golf. But "for the life of me, I
didn't believe I could be as good as Connery -- he was my hero."</TE>
<TE>   Lazenby could handle the action scenes easily enough because of
his swagger and natural athletic ability, but admits he was too
inexperienced for the more complex emotional demands of Fleming's
best story in which Bond falls in love and marries a free spirit
played by Diana Rigg.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I didn't understand that part of life -- the dark
side of what killing does," Lazenby said. "And [Bond] would do it
because he had this [dispassionate] quality. And he then showed his
emotions and lost it when they [killed] his wife. I understood that
he was falling in love but didn't understand the deeper things going
on."</TE>
<TE>   Although Lazenby, 63, regrets quitting Bond after only one film
(he was advised by a London hipster that the success of "Easy Rider"
was going to kill the franchise), he is proud of his final moment as
007. On the first take, he shed tears, but then was instructed by the
assistant director -- director Peter Hunt never spoke to him after an
early falling-out -- that Bond doesn't cry. On the next take, with
Rigg biting his leg for support, Lazenby summoned a more poignant
performance. "It's the only one that closely follows the book, which
is why the fans adore it so."</TE>
<TE>   'We had a lot of laughs'</TE>
<TE>   Making the transition to a more humorous Bond was easy for the
good-looking and laid-back Moore after playing "The Saint" on TV.
"All I had to do was be Bond, but it was the villains who had all the
fun and got to say, 'You've really gone too far this time, Mr. Bond,'
" said Moore, 75, via telephone from Monte Carlo, where he lives part
of the year. "We had a lot of laughs doing them. I remember the last
day of shooting one of the Bonds, I saw [producer Cubby Broccoli's]
head peering out from one of the sets, and a bucket of paste came
flying down at me on one of those wonderful silk suits I was looking
forward to stealing."</TE>
<TE>   But now Bond is taken for granted, said Dalton, 56, in Los Angeles
where he's working on "Looney Tunes: Back in Action."</TE>
<TE>   His only regret is that he wasn't given droll humor to lighten the
tone. "I think everyone who has played Bond has suddenly realized
that the role overtakes the individual. He drives the story along,
but you find that every other character has often been written
afresh. Bond is less well-written because he's such a part of our
consciousness, so his purpose is to get through one action sequence
after another."</TE>
<TE>   "From Russia With Love," with its suspenseful train encounter, is
the exception. "It was all about the look in the people's eyes, what
was going on, and it was a real piece of drama," Dalton enthused.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his own frustrations in trying to overcome the limitations
of the franchise, Bond has been a dream come true for Brosnan, 49,
who as a lad was first blown away by "Goldfinger" in 1964. "Everybody
has their own take on how to play Bond. For me, there's only one man
who's played it and is Bond to this day, and that's Connery. He
must've been blindsided. You have to be prepared to go through many
doors because you're not just an actor, you become the frontman for
this franchise. For me, above all else, it's been about getting away
with creating the role, having a love affair with the piece as a fan,
the pride in the work and being part of this legacy."</TE>

<LD>With the release of "Die Another Day" on Friday, James Bond steps
into the 21st century. The stylized espionage series has been around
so long that most moviegoers don't even remember a time before 007.
Here's how the forerunners, excluding a pair produced outside the
MGM/UA fold, stack up.</LD>
<LD>   1. "From Russia With Love" (1963)</LD>
<LD>   The best Bond? It's a tossup between this and "Goldfinger," with
great intrigue and the best supporting cast (including Lotte Lenya,
Robert Shaw and Pedro Armendariz).</LD>
<TE>   2. "Goldfinger" (1964)</TE>
<TE>   The series peaked here with the heist at Ft. Knox, the
gold-obsessed villain, henchman Oddjob, the Aston Martin, Pussy
Galore and that sensuous Shirley Bassey title song.</TE>
<TE>   3. "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" (1969)</TE>
<TE>   No Connery, but it's got the best story, the best action, the best
Bond girl (Diana Rigg), the best John Barry score and the most heart.</TE>
<TE>   4. "Dr. No" (1962)</TE>
<TE>   The first and most sadistic of the Bonds, with Connery getting his
feet wet and slipping into a dry martini as 007.</TE>
<TE>   5. "Thunderball" (1965)</TE>
<TE>   The franchise starts to jump off the deep end with gadgetry and
the plot is a bit ponderous, but the Oscar-winning underwater action
was groundbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   6. "You Only Live Twice" (1967)</TE>
<TE>   Bond in Japan, face to face for the first time with his arch
nemesis, Blofeld. You gotta love it, even if the formula starts to
run dry.</TE>
<TE>   7. "Diamonds Are Forever" (1971)</TE>
<TE>   Connery's last appearance in the franchise, the first gay couple
and the first over-the-top entry.</TE>
<TE>   8. "The World Is Not Enough" (1999)</TE>
<TE>   Brosnan comes into his own as 007, and director Michael Apted
stresses more character and plot.</TE>
<TE>   9. "The Spy Who Loved Me" (1977)</TE>
<TE>   Moore's best Bond, featuring fun and frolic in Egypt. And don't
forget Jaws (Richard Kiel).</TE>
<TE>   10."Licence to Kill" (1989)</TE>
<TE>   Dalton doesn't much care for the dour tone, but the
vengeance-is-mine theme has power and resonance.</TE>
<TE>   11. "Tomorrow Never Dies" (1997)</TE>
<TE>   Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh get it on in exotic fashion.</TE>
<TE>   12. "GoldenEye" (1995)</TE>
<TE>   Brosnan's first Bond ain't "Goldfinger," but its wall-to-wall
action shook up the franchise and infused box-office blood.</TE>
<TE>   13. "The Living Daylights" (1987)</TE>
<TE>   Dalton's first Bond displays a unique intensity as the franchise
returns to its Fleming roots.</TE>
<TE>   14. "For Your Eyes Only" (1981)</TE>
<TE>   Moore's most serious Bond also has an effective revenge theme.</TE>
<TE>   15. "Live and Let Die" (1973)</TE>
<TE>   Goodbye Connery, hello Moore. A wild ride underscored by that
Wings title song.</TE>
<TE>   16. "Moonraker" (1979)</TE>
<TE>   This has a cult following for its outer-space trappings, but it's
only diverting. Can you say "Star Wars"?</TE>
<TE>   17. "Octopussy" (1983)</TE>
<TE>   Moore starts to run out of energy; the franchise recycles more
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   18. "The Man With the Golden Gun" (1974)</TE>
<TE>   Fleming's last novel disappoints as a film drained of all weight
and emotional context, but Christopher Lee is elegant as the
million-dollar bounty hunter.</TE>
<TE>   19. "A View to a Kill" (1985)</TE>
<TE>   Moore looks bored in his final Bond, but Christopher Walken shines
with eccentric zeal as the super-villain.</TE>

<HD>New cars, classic mood</HD>
<DH>Designs by J Mays, showcased at MOCA, combine his vision
with an emotional tug he feels from the classics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Freudenheim</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Las Vegas</DL>
<LD>J Mays is driving a brand new red convertible Thunderbird with the
top down. It's a beautiful day, the traffic on the Strip is unusually
light, and he's smiling, snug in the bucket seat, knees just above
the bottom of the steering wheel, one hand steering, the other
resting on the bright red gearshift. Short cropped hair, Brioni suit,
black mock-turtleneck. Very cool.</LD>
<LD>   A young woman pulls up beside him, rolls down her window and asks
how much the car sells for. Automatically, clearly used to such
questions, he tells her, "$35,000 list," and when she says,
"Good-looking car," he smiles and quite genuinely responds, "Well,
thank you." For no apparent reason, as he speaks she looks sharply at
him and asks, "Did you design it?" Mays tips his head slightly,
clearly taken aback by the question in this anonymous setting, and
responds, "Yes, I did."</LD>
<LD>   How did she know? Was she for real? Las Vegas, with all its false
facades, layered realities and incongruous juxtapositions, seems the
perfect setting for such a Memorex moment. And Mays, vice president
for global design at Ford Motor Co., who's in town briefly for a show
of specialty automotive equipment, has become best known for
re-designing such classics as the T-Bird. He may just be the perfect
subject for such a question -- which really is not as simple as it
sounds.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, he did design it. And, well, no, he didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Mays is the hands-on director of the design team that created the
new Thunderbird, which is based on the 1950s and '60s Thunderbirds
but isn't really the same at all. It's updated, refined, spiffier and
very 2000s, as authentic a new car as the Venetian Hotel (which he's
just passed) is an authentic new hotel, and as different from an
original T-Bird as the Venetian is from Venice. Which is what life
appears to be all about these days. The new is about the old, looking
forward means looking back -- from the techno-reissues of classic pop
singles to the appropriations of artists like Sherry Levine, who has
photographed other photographers' work, or Kenny Scharf, who has
incorporated familiar cartoon figures in his paintings, to the
feel-good comeback of hippie fashion. Still, it takes a visionary to
make the new into more than the old in a way that is just right for
today.</TE>
<TE>   "Retrofuturism: The Car Design of J Mays" opens today at the
Geffen Contemporary at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art. Organized
by Brooke Hodge, MOCA's architecture and design curator, this is, she
says, the first museum exhibition to be devoted to the work of a
single American car designer. The question of how automotive design
fits into a larger cultural context seems particularly relevant at a
museum like MOCA, which in one of its first shows, in 1984, presented
"Automobile and Culture," an examination of the overlap between cars
and art.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Mays, who sees the world as a palette for his designs,
is comfortable skipping from discussions of Las Vegas to art, movies,
rap music and fashion, despite the fact that he sees his own work as
fundamentally linked to the classical geometry of Modernism.</TE>
<TE>   Exploratory gestures</TE>
<TE>   Mays' philosophy is that every good design elicits an emotional
response. Much like a movie, he says, a car takes your imagination to
places you haven't been for a while, or have never been. "You don't
actually lay the entire story out," he says, "but you put just enough
clues in the design of the vehicle that the customer can connect the
rest of the dots in their mind."</TE>
<TE>   At 48, Mays seems both wise and unimpressed with himself,
comfortable making grand statements and yet not ready to give up his
involvement in the minutiae of creating new products. Both very urban
and also decidedly rooted in middle America, he was born and raised
in Maysville, Okla., a town just south of Oklahoma City that's named
for his family and that, at the time of his childhood, had a
population of 800. The single-initial (no period) first name, he
laughs, is not an affectation, but the result of unimaginative naming
practices in his family. "Like J.R. Ewing," he says.</TE>
<TE>   After studying journalism at the University of Oklahoma, Mays
skipped out to Pasadena's Art Center College of Design to study car
design. It was the late 1970s, and he quickly stood out for his
conservatism. "He was more focused than everyone else," remembers
Richard Pietruska, an instructor in the transportation department.
"He was pretty clean-cut and was more interested in designing an
aerodynamic look, when the other students were interested in radical
styling."</TE>
<TE>   Upon graduating in 1980, Mays moved to Germany to work for Audi
AG, where he designed the Avus Quattro concept vehicle, a sleek
sports car that eventually evolved into the Audi TT. He broke into
the big time, however, when he returned to the United States for
Volkswagen and, in collaboration with Freeman Thomas, developed the
prototype for the new Beetle, revealed in 1994 as Concept One.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Mays became the global design master at Ford,
based in Detroit, where he oversees all eight divisions: the classic
Blue Oval (as they call it in Michigan), Lincoln, Mercury, Mazda,
Volvo, Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin.</TE>
<TE>   At Ford, he has developed the GT40 and the 2002 Thunderbird, among
others. His concept vehicles, which are highlighted at MOCA, include
the Ford Forty-Nine, the 021C (developed with hip product designer
Marc Newson) and the Ma, to be unveiled for the first time in the
exhibition. The latter is a modern hot rod, created as a kit to be
assembled by the customer, with bamboo hood and seats and an aluminum
frame. It was designed by Jose Paris, under Mays' supervision, and
Mays says it will more than likely remain just a concept.</TE>
<TE>   "J is extraordinary for his exploratory gestures," says Richard
Koshalek, president of Art Center. "He is exceptional in the way that
he combines car and product design."</TE>
<TE>   Not simply a Retrofuturist, Mays spans a wide range of interests
in his designs. The Audi Avus Quattro is a fantasy of a sleek,
high-end racer, while the Beetle embodies the practical simplicity of
its predecessor, reduced to simpler geometry that, turned
upside-down, looks like either a classic smiley face or Mickey Mouse,
a fact that has not escaped its creator. The same simple
functionality is echoed in the boxy Ford 021C, named for an orange
Pantone color. A lust for Ford's glory days inspired the Forty-Nine,
an extreme simplification of the lumbering 1949 homeboy car that
inspired it. But for pure romance, there's nothing like the
Thunderbird.</TE>
<TE>   Mays' own connection to the mystique of the Thunderbird is direct.
"It was 1965," he says, smiling at the memory. "I was 10 years old,
and my brother was 17. My dad had to trade in the '63 Caprice that we
had, and he wanted to get a new family sedan. He disappeared off down
to the Ford dealership, where he had seen a Galaxy he wanted to
purchase. He was going to be back in an hour or two.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, an hour went by, two hours went by, three hours went by,
and the sun started going down, and he still wasn't back. And
finally, just before the sun set -- we lived up on a hill, and you
could see down onto the road below our home -- we saw this turquoise
Thunderbird coming toward the house, and my brother and I were just
jumping around like madmen going, 'Dad bought the Bird! Dad bought
the Bird!' It was just a huge big family emotional event. We weren't
wealthy, and Thunderbirds weren't that expensive, but it just said,
'This is a typical middle-class family having the good life.' "</TE>
<TE>   A yearning to recapture that magic is at the heart of
Retrofuturism, a movement that has developed over the past two
decades in art and commerce in response to the global death of
optimism, Mays and others believe. Where once the future looked
bright -- in the 1950s and '60s -- the image of that future remained
fixed on the year 2000. "With every year, the future became nearer.
It had a number on it," Mays says. "So the unfortunate eventuality
is, we've gotten to the future, and it isn't what we expected. I
think we're a bit scared of the future at this point."</TE>
<TE>   Evoking mid-20th century design conjures up the thrill of that
turquoise T-Bird coming up the hill. "It's a safety blanket of
sorts," Mays admits, "a longing on the part of people who want to
hold onto something that makes them feel pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   Degas and dashboards</TE>
<TE>   As he drives the T-Bird through the bright streets of Las Vegas,
Mays talks about how a show of paintings by Degas at the Detroit Art
Institute made him realize how far he needs to go to improve the
palette of car interiors. How the light in the 19th century
Impressionist's paintings helped codify his vision of how color can
affect how we feel in a car.</TE>
<TE>   He may be designing for the fast lane, but he takes time to notice
the details and to see what he can learn. Even from artifacts that
were made to be taken in in very slow motion.</TE>
<TE>   And when he wants to see the real future, he has to look no
farther than his 9-year-old son. Mays says the boy regularly rolls
his eyes and tells him, "Oh, Dad, you don't have any style." The
designer's response is pretty typical of a dad facing middle age.
"You know," he says, "I look at my wife, and she says, 'He's right,
you know.' And he is."</TE>
<TE>   Professionally, the eye-rolling is a challenge, because Mays and
his team are working on cars that may not emerge for another six or
seven years -- cars, he points out, that his son will be driving
someday. But perhaps Mays' mix of self-deprecation and clarity of
vision is what has allowed him to make work that bows as it borrows
from eras past, even as it somewhat arrogantly attempts to make the

<HD>In a world of weasels</HD>
<DH>'Dilbert' creator Scott Adams explains how everybody from
Enron to your lazy co-worker gets away with so much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shawn Hubler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Energy rip-offs, insider trading, crumbling institutions, double-talk
from Wall Street to Pennsylvania Avenue -- what has the world come
to? Scott Adams has a theory.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a huge weasel bubble forming in society," postulates the
Bay Area cartoonist who created Dilbert, the mouthless
cubicle-dweller and patron saint of American wage slaves. "You've
heard how, when cabdrivers start giving you stock tips, you know it's
a stock market bubble? Well, when historians make up history and
executives are falsifying resumes and priests are having better sex
than you are -- well, when things like that happen, you know that
society has become weasel-infested." Hence Adams' new book, "Dilbert
and the Way of the Weasel" (HarperBusiness).</LD>
<LD>   Reached by phone in Seattle (where he was either doing a book
signing or weaseling out of work on a Thursday, he wasn't quite
saying), Adams elaborated on this weasel thing.</LD>
<TE>   Hasn't the world always had its weasels?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, I think so. But the best weasels are so much more effective
than they used to be. It's a time management thing. It isn't just
personal calls on the work phone anymore. Now it's "Let's spend a
bunch of money and call it all capital expenses!" It's a whole
different level today.</TE>
<TE>   Is that what inspired you to do this book?</TE>
<TE>   I just kept noticing that everybody seemed despicable, from
businessmen to politicians to just about every encounter. I also send
a newsletter out to about 600,000 people, and they send me their
stories. One of my favorites was how all the dot-coms, which had all
these cubicles with nobody in them, were dressing up the empty
cubicles when visitors came to make them appear occupied. One company
was actually asking employees to bring in family members to sit in
the cubicles so the place wouldn't look so deserted.</TE>
<TE>   Another bunch of stories involved the great goal of all
management, which is to give employees things they feel are like
money but don't cost anything. In the dot-com era, it used to be
stock options. Now I'm hearing it's 'imaginary raises.' The way it
works is, you come in for your annual performance review and the boss
says that they're not giving raises this year, but if they could give
raises -- which they can't -- but if they could, you'd get 4% this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds like if you can't beat 'em, this is the time to join 'em.
How can the Way of the Weasel be put to use by a rank-and-file
employee?</TE>
<TE>   Well, take teamwork. Teamwork is a trick often used in the office
by other people to get you to do their work for them. So if someone
tries to rope you into being on a "team," you counter with a weasel
trick known as Being Too Helpful.</TE>
<TE>   You cheerfully agree to help, but then at every stage you question
the global strategic implications. If they want you to make copies,
you question the whole idea of the use of paper -- paper versus
paperless strategies, double-sided versus one-sided copies, legal or
regular-sized paper. In other words, you become so eager to please
that you become a huge pain. This way no one ever asks for your help
again, and the beauty is that any complaints sound unreasonable
because they're essentially that you were being too helpful.</TE>
<TE>   How about using weasel techniques to ward off layoffs?</TE>
<TE>   What I recommend is that when you smell it coming -- and a weasel
can always smell it coming -- that's the time to get a fake back
injury. Don't do it the ordinary way and stop worrying the minute you
get disability. You have to be conscious that they might send someone
out with a video camera to see if you're really injured. So, say
you've made your claim, and now you're golfing. Right after every
putt, throw yourself on the ground and writhe in agony. That way, the
rest of your foursome will just think you're a bad sport, but you're
covered in case anybody's filming secretly.</TE>
<TE>   What if you're further up the food chain and vulnerable to
damaging allegations from underlings, a la Martha Stewart? How can
the Way of the Weasel apply?</TE>
<TE>   Do this trick. When a co-worker is hired who might end up as a
witness against you, inoculate yourself. You go to your boss and say,
"You know the new guy? I think he's a pathological liar."</TE>
<TE>   Because whatever people say about the new guy always sticks
forever. And you want to get him before he goes to the boss and gets
you.</TE>
<TE>   Hmm. That sounds a little effortful. What advice do you have for
people who prefer to weasel out of the company of weasels altogether?
In other words, how do you spot weasels in your midst?</TE>
<TE>   I give this handy tip. Look into any shiny object and you'll see a
weasel. Also, weasels are very attracted to money. I calculate that
$10 will attract one weasel. So if you put down a $20 bill and two
people appear as if by magic, those are the weasels and you can avoid
them.</TE>
<TE>   Are some jobs more attractive than others to weasels?</TE>
<TE>   Well, this book is, of course, focused on weasels in the executive
suite. But I do go broader, by thinking about what jobs I'd like if I
didn't have the greatest weasel job of all, which is criticizing
things that other people do. If you're a weasel, you want jobs where
it's impossible for anyone on the outside to tell if you're skilled
or just a huge, stinking weasel.</TE>
<TE>   That's why archeology is good. If I found a toenail in the desert,
I could construct a whole elaborate civilization to go with it and
almost no one would be able to tell whether I knew what I was doing.
Also, historian is a good weasel job, because I think history is
almost completely made up and nobody knows but other historians, and
they're not telling.</TE>
<TE>   The best weasel job, though, would be defense attorney for accused
murderers in Texas. Because if you win the case, you look brilliant,
and if you lose, the only person who might complain -- your customer
-- will get killed by the state.</TE>
<TE>   You asked your readers about weasel jobs, too, right?</TE>
<TE>   We had a poll on the Dilbert.com Web site. We asked readers to
vote for the weaseliest individuals, companies, organizations and so
on. They thought the weaseliest profession was, ahem, news reporter.
What's even funnier is, you beat out lawyers, politicians and tobacco
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously your Web site has a large readership among pathological
liars, $20 bill collectors and long-tailed carnivorous mammals. Is
there one place in particular that should be avoided by un-weasely
souls such as reporters?</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles. It's the natural habitat of the weasel.</TE>
<TE>   Um, we have to stop here. Your correspondent appears to be coming
down with a back injury.</TE>

<LD>Scott Adams, the creator of the "Dilbert" comic strip, invited
visitors to his Dilbert.com Web site to vote on "the weaseliest
individuals and organizations of 2002." Adams says 116,000 votes were
cast in six weasel categories:</LD>
<LD>   Weaseliest organization -- Democratic Party ...29%</LD>
<LD>   Major league baseball -- 21%</LD>
<TE>   White House -- 19%</TE>
<TE>   Congress -- 13%</TE>
<TE>   Republican Party -- 11%</TE>
<TE>   FBI -- 4%</TE>
<TE>   Adams: "There was an organization of conservative Republican
activists who told members on their Web site to get out the vote in
the Weasel poll. It's a tactic, apparently, that this group uses any
time it hears about an unscientific poll being done somewhere, to
make the entire world look like a conservative Republican."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weaseliest country</TE>
<TE>   France -- 34%</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia -- 23%</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan -- 18%</TE>
<TE>   Iraq -- 18%</TE>
<TE>   North Korea -- 3%</TE>
<TE>   Iran -- 1%</TE>
<TE>   Adams: "I owe this one to name recognition. It's the same reason
you can win almost any election if your name is Kennedy. Also, I
think a lot of voters were looking at the list and thinking, 'Hmm,
North Korea, is that the good one or the bad one?' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weaseliest company</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft (Bill Gates) -- 39%</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen -- 20%</TE>
<TE>   Enron -- 18%</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom -- 7%</TE>
<TE>   Rite Aid -- 6%</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch -- 2%</TE>
<TE>   Qwest -- 2%</TE>
<TE>   Tyco -- 2%</TE>
<TE>   Adams: Microsoft was "the most proficient at weasel-dom, in that
they get away with it. Say what you will about Microsoft, no one
there is being hauled off in shackles. You can't say that for the
rest."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weaseliest profession</TE>
<TE>   News reporters -- 24%</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers -- 22%</TE>
<TE>   Politicians -- 18%</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco executives -- 17%</TE>
<TE>   Accountants -- 5%</TE>
<TE>   Oil executives -- 5%</TE>
<TE>   Advertising executives -- 4%</TE>
<TE>   Adams: "Whether you're liberal or conservative, no one really
believes reporters don't have some kind of weasely bias. But look who
you beat out! I mean, tobacco executives?!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weaseliest individual</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart  -- 24%</TE>
<TE>   Gary Condit -- 19%</TE>
<TE>   Marie Reine Le Gougne (French ice skating</TE>
<TE>   judge) -- 18%</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Lay (Enron) -- 17%</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson -- 10%</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Kozlowski (Tyco) -- 4%</TE>
<TE>   Gary Winnick (Global Crossing) -- 2%</TE>
<TE>   "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap -- 1%</TE>
<TE>   Sam Waksal (ImClone) -- 1%</TE>
<TE>   Adams: "The insider trading allegations alone probably wouldn't
have been enough to put her over as a weasel. But her craft projects
are just so much harder than she makes them look."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Weaseliest religion</TE>
<TE>   Islam  -- 32%</TE>
<TE>   Catholicism -- 27%</TE>
<TE>   Atheism -- 22%</TE>
<TE>   Protestantism -- 9%</TE>
<TE>   Judaism -- .6%</TE>
<TE>   Buddhism -- 1%</TE>
<TE>   Hinduism -- 1%</TE>
<TE>   Adams: "What can I say? Islam isn't getting good press lately. But
to me, the funniest thing was that Buddhism got over 200 votes! Who's
picking up the paper these days and thinking, 'Damn those Buddhists!
They're ruining everything!' That's what I want to know."</TE>

<HD>When Elvis bowed to karate's kings</HD>
<DH>A Presley-backed documentary on the sport is finally out --
minus footage of the black-belt singer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's just a frayed, weathered, black karate belt, but it means the
world to George Waite, the former president of TCB -- Elvis Presley's
film company. The belt belonged to the King way back when, and Waite
has had it since Presley's death in 1977. Until recently, Waite had
never shown it to anyone because the memory of his loss was so
painful. Presley's death also put an end to a karate film called "New
Gladiators" that the singer had financed and that Waite -- a
self-described "karate bum" -- had produced in 1974. "New Gladiators"
was supposed to be to karate what Bruce Brown's classic "The Endless
Summer" was to surfing -- a definitive film about the sport. Presley
was scheduled to co-narrate and demonstrate karate moves.</LD>
<LD>   "I kept it going until Elvis died," says Waite, who studied with
Presley's martial arts instructor, Ed Parker.</LD>
<LD>   But that wasn't the end of the story. Waite had 50 hours of
footage -- including 33 minutes of medium-girthed Presley showing off
his black-belt moves and eight minutes of Bruce Lee demonstrating
karate in 1967 in Long Beach -- in the back of his 1963 GMC pickup
truck in his garage.</LD>
<TE>   And there the project stayed until recently, when he gave the
footage to Isaac Florentine, an Israeli-born director of action
films, and Florentine's partner, Don Warrener, who ran a chain of
karate schools in Canada. Florentine and Warrener's company, Rising
Sun Productions, which distributes karate movies and other martial
arts-related items, edited the footage down to 93 minutes. (None of
the footage of Presley is in the movie because the Elvis Presley
estate wouldn't allow it to be released; according to Warrener, the
estate was unhappy with the singer's less than flattering
appearance.)</TE>
<TE>   The two are now distributing the finished product, "New
Gladiators," on video and DVD, and are hoping to interest Hollywood
in a theatrical release. "New Gladiators" documents what fans know as
the golden age of the sport, when martial artists were interested in
the art of karate and not the glory or the money. The film focuses on
several karate fighters in training and captures tournament action --
two European team matches and the Urquidez Brothers Invitational in
Beverly Hills. Several well-known martial artists of the period
appear, including John Corcoran, Ticky Donovan, Emil Farkas, Roy
Kurban, Ron Marchini, John Natividad and Benny "the Jet" Urquidez.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, Florentine, Warrener and Waite gather in
Rising Sun's cramped Beverly Hills office with three of the men in
the film: Urquidez, a world-champion kickboxer who operates the Jet
Center in Burbank; Farkas, who wrote the Encyclopedia of Martial Arts
and is owner of the Beverly Hills Karate Academy; and Dave Brock, a
seven-time karate champion. Also sitting in are writer Joe Hyams, one
of Bruce Lee's first students and author of "Zen in the Martial
Arts," and Majeet Raz, one of Urquidez's students. They are there not
so much to talk as to show their support for "New Gladiators."</TE>
<TE>   Waite first came up with an idea for doing a documentary on
tournament life in 1974 and shared it with Parker, the instructor.
"He said we should have E.P. look at this; we'll call him right now,"
Waite recalls. Presley agreed to meet with them that afternoon. "We
went up to the house and we talked for a bit, and I presented the
idea to him."</TE>
<TE>   Presley was leaving for Las Vegas that night and told the two he
would have to think about it. "A couple of hours later, he said he
liked the idea and said, 'Come to Vegas.' So I went to Vegas and we
talked about the film. He gave me a check for $50,000."</TE>
<TE>   Waite says he never completed the film and didn't want to use the
16-millimeter footage of Presley, hoping instead to shoot him on
35-millimeter in more choreographed moves. But the King's weight had
ballooned since the film's inception. "We thought he was going to
come down a little bit [in weight]. We flew back to Memphis a few
times and showed him the film, and he said, 'That's good enough to
me.' He wore a rubber suit and I thought he would get smaller, but he
didn't. It's always hard to cut someone into something when they are
heavy. And it doesn't look good for the sport."</TE>
<TE>   To Florentine and Warrener, resurrecting "New Gladiators" is akin
to exhibiting the Lost Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail. The
film has achieved almost legendary status among karate devotees. In
fact, Florentine first heard of "New Gladiators" back in Israel in
the late '70s when he was a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   Since its release on DVD and VHS in August, "New Gladiators" has
become Rising Sun's biggest seller of the year (1,345 copies sold so
far).</TE>
<TE>   Waite says that the film was 90% complete before he gave it to
Florentine and Warrener. "I tried to keep it as much as possible
intact the way they meant it to be," Florentine says. "I didn't want
to cut stuff. When you see it now in the 21st century, it takes you
back into the '70s and really captures the period. There were holes
in the film, but we patched it."</TE>
<TE>   "This film was never made for release for the general public,"
Waite adds. "It was made for us -- the karate world."</TE>
<TE>   To complete "New Gladiators," Florentine used the work print --
one that hasn't been color corrected or timed. So the quality of the
print is atrocious -- there are skips, jarring jumps, and the picture
is a faded mixture of browns and yellows.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are several credit problems. The poster says that
Oscar-winners "Davio &amp; Hora" supplied the cinematography. It is
pointed out to a rather embarrassed Florentine that one of the
cinematographers is Allen Daviau, not Davio -- he's also listed as
Allen Davio in the credits. And though Daviau's been nominated for
such films as "E.T." and "Bugsy," he has never won an Oscar. John
Hora, who was the director of cinematography on such films as
"Gremlins," has never been nominated for an Academy Award. And on
both the credits and posters, the late actor Iron Eyes Cody is
referred to as Iron Eye Cody.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone involved in the film knows that, as is, "New Gladiators"
couldn't be distributed theatrically. Still, Florentine says, "I
think it deserves justice." It is their dream that a savvy filmmaker
in Hollywood will restore the original print, recut the negative and
release it theatrically.</TE>
<TE>   Waite believes the original negative is in pretty good shape -- it
sits in boxes in a corner in the back room at Rising Sun. Time is of
the essence for restoration because Waite, Florentine and Warrener
say they were knocked back from the smell of vinegar when they opened
the film cans -- a sign that the negative could be suffering from
"vinegar syndrome" deterioration.</TE>
<TE>   They also have had a hard time explaining to Hollywood executives
exactly what they have on their hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We approach people and say we have this documentary and it was
funded by Elvis," Florentine says. "People don't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   "In the martial arts world our credibility is unquestionable,"
Warrener says. "But the outside world is a new level for us."</TE>

<LD>Some people can unlock the secrets of the sages by watching a rerun
of "Gomer Pyle." Reviewing the new Pearl Jam CD, "Riot Act" ("Pearl
Jam's hope again burns bright," Nov. 10), Steve Hochman analyzes
Eddie Vedder's singing, "To the universe I don't mean a thing / And
there's just one word that I still believe and it's love." Hochman
goes so far as to claim that this evokes the Great Man himself, John
Lennon. However, going on the lyrics alone, I have the feeling that
the often acerbic Lennon might have taken Vedder to task for such
neo-hippie prose. Had Paul McCartney or the Moody Blues used these
identical lyrics in a song from their last releases, Hochman would
have ripped them from here to, well, all across that universe.</LD>

<LD>The "problem" with two men kissing on screen will lessen as it
becomes more common. Already on television, the initial shock at the
male love scenes on "Queer as Folk" and "Six Feet Under" has subsided
into a ho-hum attitude, similar to the response to male buttocks on
"NYPD Blue." Just give it some time and stop making a big deal about
it.</LD>

<LD>Jan Breslauer does a disservice to the theater ("Mavericks bow to
change," Nov. 10) by representing as "mavericks" a number of highly
conventional, even smug public-relations types who are still mouthing
the elitist cliches of the politically correct: Mainstream audiences
are bad, but specific minority audiences the salt of the earth; too
many white males still control the money bags, etc.</LD>
<LD>   The conflict facing these spokespeople would be laughable if it
weren't so pathetic. They must choose between flattering the
prejudices of their particular constituencies or "selling out" by
drinking from the federally funded (or mainstream) teat. What any of
this coterie of "activism" has to do with genuine theatrical
achievement is beyond me.</LD>

<LD>Producers of movie musicals ("A razzle-dazzle pitchman," Nov. 3) have
one fundamental stumbling block: While any manner of
computer-generated fantasy is accepted -- even encouraged -- by film
audiences, musicals remain a tough sell because "people don't sing
and dance in real life."</LD>
<LD>   The upcoming movie of "Chicago" is already being hailed as a
triumph. Perhaps its success will turn the tide. It does seem odd,
though, that Rob Marshall should succeed in creating a satisfactory
cinematic translation of Bob Fosse's stage hit when Fosse himself,
despite several tries, was unable to do so.</LD>

<HD>Kill -- but don't kiss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I am once again saddened but not surprised by the hypocrisy of
America's attitudes on men kissing men ("More than just a kiss," Nov.
10). It strikes me as completely insane that people are more willing
to go to a film and watch men kill, torture, decapitate, mutilate,
actually eat another person's brain ("Hannibal"), grind someone up in
a wood chipper ("Fargo") or kill a man's wife and child ("Road to
Perdition") than go to a film where two human beings of the same
gender engage in something as beautiful and loving as a simple kiss.
And people wonder why we live in such a violent and intolerant
country.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that Tom Hanks declined to kiss Antonio Banderas in
"Philadelphia" (a movie that is all about compassion toward gay
males), but seems to have no problem playing men who kill, is very
telling about what America accepts as a norm and what Tom Hanks as an
actor is really about. Did Mr. Hanks think he was going to ruin his
career, or was it all a money choice? Why take on the role in the
first place?</LD>
<LD>   It's mind-boggling to think that "Philadelphia" was directed by
Jonathan Demme, who had a problem showing a kiss between two men,
even when one is on his deathbed, but has no problem showing violence
against women in such films as "The Silence of the Lambs."</LD>
<TE>   My advice to all actors who decide to play a gay part: If you have
a problem with something as harmless as a kiss, do us all a favor --
let a true actor have the part.</TE>

<TE>   The back story: In 1997, five girls lose on a Japanese TV talent
contest in which the winner gets a record deal. When the winner's
records don't sell, the show's producer cobbles the five rejects into
a group, Morning Musume (Morning's Daughters). If they could move
50,000 copies of their first single, the lore goes, producer Tsunku
would turn them into Japan's next big thing.</TE>
<TE>   In five days, the girls meet their goal as a nation of teenage
boys and middle-aged "salarymen" swoons. The all-singing, all-dancing
group crosses over into the realm of phenomenon. Morning Musume's
five doe-eyed girls grow to eight, then to 13. These days, Svengali
Tsunku shuffles the girls into sub-units: short girls into Mini Moni,
girls born in the countryside into Country Musume, other girls into
groups named after primary colors. Auditions are being held for a new
crop of Morning Musume members. Cuteness? Required. Winning singing
voice? Optional.</TE>

<KH>BRIEF ENCOUNTER</KH>
<HD>Conversant with classics</HD>
<DH>Just as he would for the Bard, Kenneth Branagh studied up
for the latest 'Harry Potter.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Abramowitz</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth Branagh might be better known for his portrayal of
Shakespeare's greats, from Henry V to Richard III to Hamlet. Yet,
that hasn't stopped the 41-year-old thespian from dabbling in a
modern classic, forgoing angst -- and dignity -- for a chance to
portray J.K. Rowling's foppish foil, Gilderoy Lockhart, the Hogwarts
School's defense against the dark arts teacher in "Harry Potter and
the Chamber of Secrets."</LD>
<LD>   Were you familiar with the series before you signed on to play
Lockhart?</LD>
<LD>   My sister introduced me to them. I suppose I had slightly resisted
them. I would have been one of those people, possibly, who waited, as
they did in Britain, until Bloomsbury brought out new editions of the
books that had rather more adult covers. A lot of people were sort of
embarrassed being seen on Underground trains reading children's
books. Nonetheless, my sister brought me a copy of the children's
versions. I enjoyed them enormously.</LD>
<TE>   How did you prepare for the role? I did go and read all the books
around Harry Potter: things about the creatures described in the book
and where they come from. All of them are amalgams of mythological
creatures that can be researched. There are now junior theses on the
meaning of various characters, plots, thematic ideas in her books. I
also read a couple of Restoration plays, actually, because the figure
of the fop in Restoration drama is a classic type.</TE>
<TE>   Gilderoy Lockhart is famous for writing his autobiography, and
when you were only 28, you wrote yours. Could you relate?</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to think my book was not quite as full of itself as
Gilderoy Lockhart's. [Laughs.] I'd also like to think what I wrote in
the book was true. Gilderoy's great gift is for collaboration. Of
course, he's a great fraud, a charlatan. But I think J.K. Rowling
seemed to enjoy this amazing capacity with Lockhart to believe
anything he says about himself at the moment he says it. This is a
man without any capacity for guilt and an absolutely unashamed,
ruthless pursuit of self-publicity at any cost, with the natural
ruthlessness of the natural coward as well. I'd very much like to
think that wasn't part of my book.</TE>
<TE>   How does it feel to be a cultural icon to children?</TE>
<TE>   It is very strange to have your name called out by 10-year-olds. I
find kids will come up and ask me what I'm wearing and if their
favorite bit is in the film. "Why do I think he's so stupid, Gilderoy
Lockhart?" Questions I can't answer. I say, "Well, he doesn't think
he's stupid, and that's what makes him funny."</TE>
<TE>   This is a change of pace from the parts you've played recently.</TE>
<TE>   In the last couple of years I've played Shackleton, the Antarctic
explorer [in TV's "Shackleton"] who's a kind of a geezer, and
Heydrich [a trusted Hitler aide, in "Conspiracy"], who was this
extraordinary monster. I feel as if I've been doing comedy for a long
time. I remember when I left drama school, there were a couple of
opportunities to do situation comedy series, to be daft characters in
... sitcoms, which I enjoy watching, but I resisted strongly. I
didn't want to get typecast as a comic actor. It's been nice to be
able to surprise people. If you've done as much Shakespeare as I have
done, I think people on the whole are absolutely astonished if you
have any sense of humor at all.</TE>

<LD>It was an odd dichotomy -- cocktail-sipping guests gathered at a bar
to toast an organization, the Musicians' Assistance Program, that
helps drug users and alcoholics beat their addictions. Clearly, the
most famous recovering addicts in the room -- Stone Temple Pilots
frontman Scott Weiland and actor Robert Downey Jr. -- weren't
bothered by the imbibing at the House of Blues in West Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   They had their hands full with the press. Weiland fielded
questions about how group co-founder and fellow recovering addict
Buddy Arnold helped him battle heroin addiction: "One time, he said,
'I don't think you're ready to stop shooting dope.' It took a few
months behind bars to settle that for me." Next, Weiland was asked
about Winona Ryder's chances of a comeback. "Hollywood is very
forgiving," he replied.</LD>
<LD>   The cocktail hour notwithstanding, the Nov. 7 benefit was a sober
evening of food and music and moments of humor, held to celebrate the
program's 10th anniversary.</LD>
<TE>   Before the dinner and musical performances, Downey, the evening's
emcee, pushed his way through the crowd of photographers and past an
event coordinator, who gushed, "We got so many calls [from guests]
saying you're so inspirational!" Downey brushed off the compliment,
choosing instead to ham it up. "Steal my soul!" he shouted to the
photographers. "Go ahead! Take my picture!"</TE>
<TE>   Later, as he furiously smoked a cigarette, Downey admitted that he
was anxious about taking the stage. "I just don't want to do too
much," he said. "I'm afraid I just might blow it."</TE>
<TE>   He had a rough start but soon warmed to the spotlight, willingly
lampooning his recent ups and downs. He introduced his estranged
wife, singer-actress Deborah Falconer, as "a girl who is still
wondering why I won't sign the divorce papers." (They've been
separated for years.) While praising the musicians' program, Downey
explained that he discovered the organization just after "my annual
stint at some rehab but before my annual awakening."</TE>
<TE>   After a particularly soulful rendition of Bob Dylan's "I Shall Be
Released" by Weiland and Bob Forrest of the 1980s band Thelonious
Monster, Downey told the modest crowd that the song reminded him of
his early release from Corcoran State Prison after serving a year.</TE>
<TE>   After a hat was passed around for cash donations, he promised: "We
can assure you that none of that money will be spent in MacArthur
Park."</TE>

<LD>In coming months, you won't have to tune in the History Channel to
encounter Adolf Hitler. A spate of projects attempts to find new
stories behind the familiar face of evil. Here's the Fuhrer as you've
never seen him: misguided youth, frustrated artist, boss under siege
in the bunker. It's "Prime Time for Hitler," as a recent headline in
the Jewish Journal observed.</LD>
<LD>   Late December brings "Max" to the theaters. Set in 1918 Munich,
the film tells the story of Max Rothman (John Cusack), an aspiring
artist and Jew who lost his right arm fighting in World War I.
Opening an art gallery, he meets Hitler (Noah Taylor), a fellow war
veteran and aspiring painter who -- friendless and homeless --
transfers his creative talents to politics.</LD>
<LD>   "Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary" chronicles the man and his
downfall through the recollections of Traudl Junge -- a former Hitler
admirer who kept quiet for nearly 60 years after her day job ended.
Directed by Andre Heller, the son of a Jewish Holocaust survivor, the
Austrian film, set for release Jan. 24, is billed as a confession and
a confrontation with the country's past.</LD>
<TE>   Then there's the four-hour miniseries "Hitler," based on Ian
Kershaw's bio "Hitler: 1889-1936 Hubris." CBS Chief Executive Les
Moonves, whose Polish grandmother survived the Holocaust but lost her
10 siblings, defends the project, due to air next year. "I still
believe we should deal with all historical subjects," he says.
"Should we put our heads in the sand?" That's a question for
philosophers, and entertainment execs, that the ratings may help
answer.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I stopped talking about my idea for a movie called "The Deacons for
Defense" on Thanksgiving Day 1996, right after my cousin's husband
gave me a lecture on why it could never be made.</LD>
<LD>   It says something about the way Hollywood has leached into the
mind of the average American that a guy in New Jersey who works for
an insurance company would be able to explain why my film concept was
doomed and use the insider phrase "development hell."</LD>
<LD>   "It's too serious and too historical," he said. "And you don't
have anyone big behind it." What he didn't say, but probably thought,
was that I had been pushing this story since 1986, and if it hadn't
become a movie in that time, it wasn't going to happen.</LD>
<TE>   It was true that the story had a tortured past. I had first heard
about the Deacons from the mayor of tiny Ferriday, La.: Sammy Davis
Jr. (his real name). I had stopped to see him for an article I was
writing about the downfall of televangelist Jimmy Swaggart, one of
Ferriday's native sons. As we talked, he took an old pistol from the
drawer of his desk and announced to me, "The story you really should
write is about this gun, and about the Deacons for Defense." He then
proceeded to tell me the best, most fascinating bit of American
history you have never heard.</TE>
<TE>   The Deacons for Defense and Justice were a militia of African
American men, many veterans of World War II and Korea, who had
confronted the Ku Klux Klan during the most dangerous moments of the
civil rights movement. They had enjoyed their greatest success in
Bogalusa, a tough paper-mill town on the Mississippi state line,
where they conducted armed patrols for years and exchanged blows and
gunfire with Klansmen on the way to defeating segregation. The most
intriguing thing about the Deacons was that they defied the myth of
the passive black man of the 1950s and 1960s. They were
confrontational when the movement was nonviolent. Perhaps for that
reason, they had received short shrift from historians, who focused
mainly on figures such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   For the next few years, every time I got near Louisiana, I made
sure to interview Deacons. I searched old press reports and
eventually wrote a long proposal that failed to get a publisher
interested in a book about them. I was certain that the story had
merit, so I then wrote a 60-page movie treatment. It languished for
years, with my agent getting nothing but rejections. A couple of
Deacons died. Others stopped returning my calls. Then came the
Thanksgiving lecture and I began to worry that my cousin's husband
was right.</TE>
<TE>   I had almost buried my hopes for the Deacons' story when it was
optioned by Rehme Productions for Paramount Television in 1997. Two
screenwriters, Richard Wesley and Frank Military, turned my treatment
into a proper script. Last summer, Forest Whitaker signed to play the
leading role. Showtime agreed to broadcast "Deacons" (it airs in
February) and approved it for production.</TE>
<TE>   As the writer who conceived the story but didn't write the script,
I kept waiting to discover that my work had been chopped and
processed and remanufactured into some unrecognizable hash. It never
happened. The scripts improved on what I had conceived and followed
the history I had uncovered. Producer Nick Grillo and director Bill
Duke became fanatics about getting it right. But for me it remained a
paper exercise until I returned a call that Grillo had placed from a
strange new number.</TE>
<TE>   "Deacons for Defense," said the voice on the other end.</TE>
<TE>   My God, I thought, there's an actual office.</TE>
<TE>   Even more startling was the scene I encountered during a visit to
one of the film's outdoor sets in Canada. It was night, but huge
lights illuminated the street. Dozens of people ran around doing jobs
I didn't understand. Hours were spent on what would be 30 seconds of
action on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   I could not tell whether the scene I saw was good. And I will not
know until "Deacons for Defense" is broadcast whether it is a
superior piece of work. Even then, like a parent with his child, my
judgment will never be clear-eyed. I love the thing too much and have
lived with it too long. But all the people I met that night said they
were happy to work on a film that would preserve a true story that
might otherwise be lost. However it turns out, we have that
satisfaction.</TE>
<TE>   And there's one more thing. After 16 years, I'll be able to call
my Jersey relatives and tell them to turn on the TV and see that
Sammy Davis Jr. and I were right. Ever since I realized that, I've
been in development heaven.</TE>

<HD>Seeking another 'Friday' payday</HD>
<DH>Ice Cube works the holidays into the latest effort in the

<DL></DL>
<LD>When New Line Cinema told Ice Cube it would like to have a third
installment in the highly profitable "Friday" comedy franchise to
release around the holidays, the rapper, actor, screenwriter,
di-rector and producer decided to write the holidays into the script.
"I just realized that there was no Christmas movie about the
neighborhood," he says.</LD>
<LD>   But this isn't your typical heartwarming Christmas fare. In
keeping with the madcap ghetto humor of the first two films, "Friday
After Next" opens with a Santa suit-clad thief making off with the
presents -- and the rent money -- forcing Ice Cube's character,
Craig, to do the unthinkable: Get a job.</LD>
<LD>   It's no surprise the studio was looking for another "Friday"
payday. The original "Friday" in 1995 grossed $27 million at the box
office on a $4-million budget and became a huge bestseller on video,
prompting the $10-million-budgeted sequel, "Next Friday," which
grossed $57 million and opened at No. 1. The latest film in the
series opens Friday.</LD>
<TE>   As with the other "Friday" films and this year's hits "Barbershop"
and "All About the Benjamins," Ice Cube -- who wrote "Friday After
Next" and co-produced it -- recruited a music video director to make
his feature directing debut. This time it was Marcus Raboy, who has
worked with Mary J. Blige, Staind, Sting and Lil' Kim and directed
the much-played videos for Santana's "Smooth" and "Maria Maria," as
well as three of Ice Cube's own videos.</TE>
<TE>   Raboy's enthusiasm for the "Friday" films won over the studio
executives. Says Raboy, "I gave my take on the movie and they asked
me, 'Is this a movie you want to make or a movie you want to pay to
see?' And I told them, 'Both! I want to make this movie and then when
it comes out I want to go opening weekend and pay to see it.' "</TE>
<TE>   With a $20-million budget, "Friday After Next" was shot last
winter in San Pedro and Torrance, where the production bought out a
strip mall for six weeks to refashion as the domain of Craig and his
cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps), who land jobs as security guards armed
only with police whistles. Among the movie strip mall's shops: Bros.
Bar-B-Q and the Pimps 'N Ho's clothing store owned by new character
Money Mike.</TE>
<TE>   Again, Ice Cube was on the lookout for fresh talent and auditioned
scores of actors, the way he first found his "Next Friday" co-star
Epps. This time the newcomers include stand-up comedians Katt
Williams, who plays Money Mike, and Sommore, one of the Queens of
Comedy, as well as Terry Crews, who actually worked as a security
guard on the set of "Next Friday" before pursuing acting.</TE>
<TE>   Also in keeping with the franchise, about a third of the jokes in
"Friday After Next" were improvised, Ice Cube says. "If you're doing
a comedy you have to let comedians do what they do, which is be
spontaneous. Sometimes I'll tell them, give me two scripted [takes]
and then give me two takes where you just do what you want to do
within the realm of the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Conspicuously absent is Chris Tucker, who also didn't appear in
"Next Friday" and has declined to reprise his star-making role from
the original "Friday." "Every time I go do another ['Friday' film],
I'm gonna ask him to come back," Ice Cube says. "One day he might
change his mind. I think the fans will want to see him do it, and we
can pay him, so it's really on him."</TE>
<TE>   Ice Cube, who will record a new CD with Dr. Dre producing, says
he's not thinking about a fourth "Friday" film yet, but he does have
a title. He laughs, "definitely 'Last Friday.' "</TE>

<HD>The enduring cultural life east of the 'Eastside'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Josefina Lopez doesn't fit the cliche of an L.A. bohemian. She
prefers knee-length print dresses to grungy T-shirts and ripped
jeans. She keeps her hair long and loose, not tight and spiky. And
you won't find her striking poses on Saturday nights at the Dresden
Room or in an Echo Park garage-rock band.</LD>
<LD>   But make no mistake, what the author of the low-budget hit film
"Real Women Have Curves" and other Latino artists are up to these
days in the Eastside neighborhood of Boyle Heights comes as close to
the bohemian spirit as anything happening in overexposed Echo Park
and Silver Lake.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, the 33-year-old Lopez, a Boyle Heights native
who has lived in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco, renewed
her ties to her old neighborhood. Like the opinionated, Rubenesque,
semiautobiographical heroine of "Real Women," she had to leave home
to find it. Although she and her husband still rent in Silver Lake,
they're hoping to buy a home in Boyle Heights and are already
immersed in its cultural life.</LD>
<TE>   Since January, Lopez has operated Casa 0101 Theater Art Space on
1st Street at Cummings Avenue, a couple of blocks east of Mariachi
Plaza. A former bridal shop, Casa now functions as a focal point for
a new generation of Latino artists.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, 500 people packed the house for "Caja Negra
[Black Box]," an exhibition of 17 local photographers. This weekend,
Casa 0101 is hosting the sketch-comedy group Chicano Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle Heights already has a unique ethnic and cultural heritage,
affectionately detailed in the current exhibition "Boyle Heights: The
Power of Place" at the Japanese American National Museum in Little
Tokyo. Between world wars, it was a dynamic enclave, a hodgepodge of
Mexicans, Japanese and Eastern European Jews. In the '50s and '60s,
its Jewish lefties helped inspire a new generation of Chicano
activists and artists.</TE>
<TE>   Later, it was ripped apart by half a dozen freeways and rising
crime and unemployment. Historically viewed by the rest of the city
with suspicion, if not outright hostility, Boyle Heights has always
gone its own way.</TE>
<TE>   Could the neighborhood, which is the setting for "Real Women Have
Curves" and several other feature films now in development, be ready
for a new act? And if it is, will the cultural tourism likely to
follow help or harm the area?</TE>
<TE>   "I think Boyle Heights will be the mecca," Lopez said a few days
ago in her mile-a-minute cadence as we sat at the Plaza Cafe, an
amiable, low-key coffeehouse. "I just want more places like this to
come to Boyle Heights so we can have a strip, so people, instead of
going to Universal CityWalk, they can come and spend their money
here."</TE>
<TE>   Plaza Cafe's owner, Virginia Naranjo, is another Boyle Heights
native who recently reconnected with her roots after years of living
elsewhere. "I'm having different kinds of art coming, and I'm going
to be having poetry readings too coming in," she says. "They don't
know anything like that over here. They didn't know what a latte is,
they didn't know a cappuccino."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, a few cups of gourmet java doth not an arts colony
make. But Boyle Heights has a far more valuable asset. "Outside of
Hollywood, I think it probably has the most interesting stories in
the city to tell," says James Rojas, a regional planner for the MTA
who grew up in the neighborhood. "It's like the Big Apple to
Latinos."</TE>
<TE>   To many Westside Angelenos, Boyle Heights might as well be on the
other side of the world as on the other side of the Los Angeles
River. New census data show that L.A. is increasingly two cities,
culturally if not politically: one inhabited by English speakers, the
other perceptible mainly to those who speak Spanish or are bilingual.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, this paper's writers have variously anointed Echo Park as
the "last bohemia," lamented Silver Lake's transition into an
Eastside Brentwood, complete with valet parking, and suggested that a
new bourgeois-bohemian hybrid is emerging in once-sleepy Atwater
Village. East L.A.? It barely seems to register on the radar.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Benitez, director of Self-Help Graphics &amp; Art, says that
the local habit of overlooking Boyle Heights is nothing new. In the
1850s, when businessman-founder Andrew Boyle "came upon the bluffs
and looked east, he said, 'There's nothing here.' There was tundra,
there was fauna and there were Mexicans. So I guess that didn't
count," Benitez says, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   That same cultural myopia endures today, he thinks, in the way
that Echo Park and Silver Lake have usurped the "Eastside"
designation from Latino strongholds such as Boyle Heights, Lincoln
Park and East L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's wonderful that artists in Silver Lake and Echo Park
are getting the attention. I just wish that we were," he says. "That
old cranky Chicano part of me comes out." In Boyle Heights, Benitez
adds, "art and culture is understood to be a part of daily life," but
you won't find it in loft spaces. You'll find it in the vibrant
murals, the strolling mariachis, the anonymous shrines.</TE>
<TE>   From SoHo in Manhattan to the Haight in San Francisco, it's no
secret that America's historic bohemias are being swallowed up by
gentrification.</TE>
<TE>   Yet still we cling to the romantic ideal of the exotic Ghetto
Fabulous. A new staging by director Baz Luhrmann of Puccini's opera
"La Boheme" is one of Broadway's most anticipated openings. Miramax
just released its $13-million biopic about Mexican painter Frida
Kahlo, her sometime husband Diego Rivera and their Mexico City circle
of the 1920s and '30s. Too bad the film pays so much more attention
to the love lives and wardrobes of these free spirits than to their
actual work and ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a thing about these radicals: They're a little dangerous,
but they definitely throw the best parties," Rivera (played by Alfred
Molina) tells Kahlo (Salma Hayek) in "Frida." But making art into a
way of life is about more than just wearing cool clothes and throwing
cool parties. Maybe step one toward inventing a new bohemian model is
letting go of the old one. Or finding one that's been there all
along.</TE>

<HD>They pitch, and we catch</HD>
<DH>Infomercials get no respect, but they fuel sales in the
billions. No wonder they're multiplying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Maynard</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's 2 a.m. The world is dark except for the glow of your TV. That
"Miracle Pets" marathon on Pax has ended and paid programming has
started. OK, admit it. You watch infomercials. Yes, those tacky
28-minute spots with pitchmen pushing everything from the Ab-Doer to
the Zap Cleaner Kit as though it's the Second Coming. Or rather the
Second Coming plus a free set of Ginsu steak knives.</LD>
<LD>   If you're too tired to exercise or too lazy to clean, don't worry.
Flip to another channel, where you'll find infomercial superstar
Anthony Robbins, who sells personal enhancement backed by his
mile-wide smile; or loud Billy Mays, the stocky pitchman who keeps
you enthralled at the cleaning potential of orange oil; or for a bit
of creepy fun, there's ageless Cher touting hair care products.</LD>
<LD>   And if you can resist all of this, chances are someone you know
can't. By industry estimates, infomercial viewers buy more than $115
billion in products each year. And that number is growing.
Particularly among women over 40 who represent an estimated 80% of
infomercial consumers. "Men control the remote control," says Denise
DuBarry-Hay, chief creative officer of info-company Thane
International Inc. "But women control the purse. It's in our nature
to shop anyway." It's even become a respectable enough medium for
Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft and General Motors.</LD>
<TE>   Webster's defines an infomercial as "a television program that is
an extended advertisement often including a discussion or
demonstration." That, essentially, means that anything from, say, a
five-minute spot for Time-Life's "Sounds of the '70s" CD set to QVC's
24/7/364 days of sales programming (it actually goes dark on
Christmas Day) fits the definition.</TE>
<TE>   Expect the category, born in 1984 when the Reagan administration
dropped the rules limiting the time stations could devote to
commercials, to grow too. In an ever expanding universe of channels
with an insatiable appetite for cheap programs, infomercials are just
the ticket, especially in the late-night hours. And with the threat
to conventional advertising posed by personal video recorders like
TiVo and Replay, better-produced infomercials -- disguised as
entertainment programs -- are likely to proliferate.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to get rich. They see these people on television
making money," says Ron Popeil. "But first you better make sure you
have a quality product." He should know. Dubbed "the king of
infomercials," the chief executive of Chatsworth-based Ronco
Inventions has been selling kitchen gadgets and do-it-yourself gizmos
for more than 50 years, working home shows and state fairs long
before broadcast media.</TE>
<TE>   He's also third generation in the biz: He learned the trade from
his father, Samuel, who worked the carnival circuit with his big
invention, the Veg-O-Matic ("It slices, it dices, it makes julienne
fries"). Samuel learned the business from his uncle, way back when.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Popeil's secret for staying in the game? He develops all the
inventions he sells, making him a rarity in a world where pitchmen
come and go. (Remember Susan Powter, Dave Deldatto, Mike Levy's
Amazing Discoveries, Don Lapre's MoneyMaking Secrets?) Popeil talks
about his products like they're his children: the Pocket Fisherman,
the Smokeless Ashtray, the Ronco Clean Air Machine and, of course,
the GLH Formula #9 Hair System, a thickening powder spray that covers
embarrassing bald spots. "I wear it every day," Popeil says.</TE>
<TE>   But the product he's proudest of is the Showtime Rotisserie and
BBQ, which can be bought for four easy payments of $39.95. Studio
audiences weep at the sight of fat sliding off the glistening,
whirling meat. Most of Popeil's products have sold more than $100
million, but the Showtime Rotisserie has almost exceeded $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrities push the widgets</TE>
<TE>   A natural-born, unstoppable salesman, he can't help pitching, even
when just talking: "I was on Larry King and he asked me, 'Can I put a
chicken in it at the beginning and eat it by the end of the show?' "
Popeil remembers. "At the end of the show, he said, 'That's the
best-tasting chicken I have ever had in my entire life.' When a
customer buys my machine and uses it for the first time, they say the
same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Although Popeil has become famous from his talk-show appearances,
he insists he's not a star. "I'm deemed to be a celebrity but I'm
really not. My products are the celebrities." Still, many infomercial
companies use celebrity spokespeople to successfully sell their
wares. Guthy-Renker, with annual sales of about $700 million, uses a
cadre of famous faces for its products: Daisy Fuentes for Winsor
Pilates, and Judith Light and Vanessa Williams for the acne-fighting
Proactiv Solution. One of its clients, self-improvement guru Anthony
Robbins, spoofed himself in the Farrelly brothers movie "Shallow
Hal." Fitness professionals Billy Blanks and Richard Simmons have
become their own brand names.</TE>
<TE>   But others downplay the importance of famous faces. "People think
that if they hire a well-known face that that will make a
difference," says Jan Muller, high-energy spokesman for such things
as the FoodSaver Vac 500 and the Paint Stick house-painting tool.
"But what makes the difference to the viewer is the story. If they
buy into the story and they feel that you're a person they can trust
and believe in, that's what makes people like me ... Joe Fowler,
Kathy Mitchell, people that are on year in, year out. What makes it
work is that we're ordinary people."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Denise DuBarry-Hay became more of a celebrity from
infomercials than from her earlier career as an actress. She achieved
modest success in films like "Being There" (1979) and had a regular
role on the Robert Conrad series "Baa Baa Black Sheep," but by 1988,
her acting career was drying up. "I thought I was going to wind up
producing films," she says. "Then a friend told me about a woman who
taught Barbi Benton how to play the piano in two lessons. And it
really worked." Breaking into the infomercial industry, she developed
a spot for Piano Overnight, a musical method that featured
endorsements from Benton and Alex Karras. DuBarry-Hay appeared in
subsequent ads for the piano lessons and started working on marketing
more products.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she and her husband, Bill Hay, run Thane International
Inc., one of the largest direct-response and retail marketing
companies in the world. Their bestseller is Le Presse, a food slicer,
dicer and corer (not to be confused with the Veg-O-matic). Other top
products include the California Beauty Sunless Tanner and the Youth
Cocktail, an age-defying formula of vitamins and minerals that
DuBarry-Hay pitches herself. Although the FDA has not approved the
Cocktail, DuBarry-Hay stands by her product. But of course, if you
don't, there's the federally regulated 30-day money-back guarantee.
"Anybody that knows about supplementation and nutrition would find
this to be an incredible product," she says. "We won't sell anything
that we don't 100% believe in. We don't want it to ruin our
reputation and we don't want returns."</TE>
<TE>   What does the future hold for the infomercial? Ron Pearlstein,
chief executive of Infoworx, thinks he knows. He'll talk your ear off
about "infomarketing," a one-stop-shop marketing company he's running
now that targets any budding entrepreneur with a patent, a dream --
and $80,000 to $125,000 to pay for everything from sets and props to
on-camera hosts, digital editing and distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big difference between our business model and a company
like Thane. In that scenario, a company takes over all the marketing
rights of a product that a developer has put their blood, sweat,
tears and money into over the years. And in most cases give a 2%
royalty to the product owner," Pearlstein says. "In our model, the
product owner is totally in charge. We don't make a profit on the
front end, the client covers the media costs, and if the product is
successful, we get the 2% royalty. Our client has the ability to
control their product and gain the lion's share of the profits."</TE>
<TE>   More products than respect</TE>
<TE>   Pearlstein is excited about Infoworx's newest infomercial, which
was just launched three weeks ago. It's for the Roomba, a robotic
vacuum cleaner sold for $199.95 (and developed by scientists at the
artificial intelligence lab at MIT). It's compact and small enough to
glide into corners and under coffee tables to get the job done.
"Roomba is a revolutionary product that will affect people's lives,"
Pearlstein says. But he adds that the vacuum's infomercial stands on
its own for pure entertainment value. "People have testified that
they enjoy simply sitting and watching it work. It does have a mind
of its own."</TE>
<TE>   But even with customer protection, hands-on entrepreneurs and
state-of-the-art products, will this much-maligned industry ever
catch a break? Popular culture has been taking shots at pitchmen even
pre-infomercial, i.e. Dan Aykroyd's hilarious fish-churning
Bass-O-Matic inventor on "Saturday Night Live," a direct jab at the
Veg-O-Matic. Dennis Miller ranted, "Thank God for infomercials. I
can't tell you how often I've thought I've got to learn Chinese wok
cooking from an old bald Scottish midget." Popeil, for one, takes it
all in stride. "The Bass-O-Matic was a classic," he says. "It's all
just good publicity."</TE>

<HD>Doing as Miss Debbie Allen says</HD>
<DH>A squirmy dance cast settles down and listens up as the
choreographer rehearses them for a musical. (P.S. She doesn't yell --
she corrects.)</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie J. Nelson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside a converted aerospace factory in Culver City, a tornado of
undirected motion is roaring through the brick-walled rehearsal room
bursting with nearly three dozen young dancers who can't stand still.
The grade-schoolers fidget the most, with unending try-to-top-this
cartwheels and handstands, followed by a blitz of polished
pirouettes. It is an overwhelming reminder of a child's urge to
wiggle and, perhaps, a wake-up call to parents on the fence about
having that third kid.</LD>
<LD>   In strides the woman who could give seminars to mothers of
multiples on how to extract calm from chaos. Her dancers giggle when
they affectionately say she's "the diva of diva-dom, the queen
supreme, the bomb." Usually, they call her "Miss Debbie Allen,"
saying it quickly, as if it's a single five-syllable word they have
to rush through before they turn 10.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey!" snaps Allen, in the truly scary, better-do-it-right-now
voice that every mother tries to perfect. It's fear-inducing as well
as familiar -- at least to these kids' parents -- since Allen, 52,
played choreographer Lydia Grant in "Fame," the 1980 movie and the TV
series that aired later that decade.</LD>
<TE>   Today she is directing a rehearsal of "Pearl," a contemporary
retelling of the Snow White fairy tale she originally wrote as her
directing and writing final at Howard University in 1971. ("I got an
A-plus," she says, laughing.) It incorporates a broad range of dance
styles, from ballet and jazz to tap and hip-hop as well as Cirque du
Soleil-style gymnastics.</TE>
<TE>   The musical, which premiered last spring at the Kennedy Center in
Washington, D.C., has a cast of 35 children and five adults -- more
people than appeared on stage last season at the Geffen Playhouse,
where it opens Wednesday and will run through Dec. 22.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the first professional performance for about half of
the children, who range from 6 to 18. From their perspective, the
hardest part is making "the lines believable but not cheesy," says
cherubic Noah Robbins, 12, one of three of the Seven Dwowns
(dwarf-clown acrobats) who appeared in the show back East.</TE>
<TE>   With a loud, crisp quiet-down-now snap of her fingers, Allen takes
command of the rehearsal at the nearly 2-year-old Debbie Allen Dance
Academy. If an observer finds Allen's manner the tiniest bit
unnerving, any one of the Dwowns will set the record straight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a mean yell," the 8- to 13-year-olds chorus while
sitting around a table, and occasionally lying on it, during a break
in their first rehearsal at the Geffen in early November.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Debbie Allen never yells, she corrects," says Edric Leggett,
12, a.k.a. Hungry. And after the correcting?</TE>
<TE>   "Hugs and kisses," exclaims Jamil Morgan, 10, who plays Tell Me
Why.</TE>
<TE>   Already, they are poised professionals, meeting with a reporter
without a handler and shush-ing each other when conversation strays
into potentially socially incorrect territory. ("When is this going
to be over?" asks one. "You're not supposed to ask that," the others
say in unison, making the line drip with complete shock. Miss Debbie
Allen would be proud.)</TE>
<TE>   So when Allen tells them in rehearsal, "You are all old people
that are little," it fits. She is trying to make them see that they
have the tools to understand the subtext of a scene. She is already
treating them as if their years of experience equal their ages. "They
come in with a sensibility of being a professional. That's what this
is about," Allen says. "With that said, they have all the same rules
no matter how old they are."</TE>
<TE>   Rules like: Don't be late; if you're late, you're not on. Do your
homework. Stay focused. Don't be disruptive. If you are, an
understudy -- the youngest in "Pearl" is 4 -- is always waiting in
the wings. And a new one: "Lord, have mercy, don't wear pajamas in my
rehearsal," says Allen, as girls scurry to remove the cotton bottoms.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to come from a place of authority," says the
Emmy-winning choreographer, for "Fame" and "Motown 30." "You have to
know how to make them laugh. You have to have the ability to decipher
at a glance what is going on in the room. With that many bodies,
there's always something wonderful or dangerous happening."</TE>
<TE>   Gil Cates, producing director at the Geffen, watched Allen
multitask at a recent rehearsal. "A bunch of kids were lying around
and she's telling them, 'Go help him. Eat your sandwich outside. No
drinks in here. Oh, someone put a suitcase on stage.' She's
everywhere, and she loves it."</TE>
<TE>   Working with children is about "lighting the path," Allen says. "I
want to see the next generation do something else. Every day that we
are working, I say, 'Every step I do belongs to you, so now you are
going to take that and choreograph.' This is about more than giving
back. It's bigger than that. I don't sleep well because I realize
there is so much to do."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the run of "Pearl," the cast can almost guarantee
she'll lose a little shut-eye. Every time Miss Debbie Allen stages a
production, there's an appropriately kid-centric reward -- a
sleepover. But it's never coed. How to decide whether it's the boys'
or girls' turn to do anything but sleep?</TE>
<TE>   It's a solution that doesn't allow room for sibling-like
squabbling. When the show is about a girl, the girls get the
sleepover, and vice-versa. Not a single little old person could see
anything wrong with that.</TE>

<HD>Chicago newspapers have young readers seeing red</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's called "Hot Spot" and it introduces the news item at the top of
the F.Y.I. World and F.Y.I. Nation pages in RedEye, the new tabloid
the Chicago Tribune is publishing in an attempt to capture the
heretofore newspaper-averse 18-to-34 age group.</LD>
<LD>   In its second week of publication, RedEye's "Hot Spots" included
London (where a study found that women were "almost twice as likely
as men to have a collision while parking"); Norway's Skaalvik fiord
(where "Keiko the killer whale and 'Free Willy' star is ready to be
moved to another bay"), and Missouri (where RedEye editors made a
startling discovery: There are cities named Whoop-Up, Lickskillet and
Pucky-Huddle).</LD>
<LD>   If this is RedEye's idea of news that will send 18-to-34-year-olds
scurrying to their corner newsstand, I think they can find another
use for their obsession with red. The paper already has RedEye, Red
Hot and Red Zone. How about Red Ink?</LD>
<TE>   Editors have always complained that young people don't read
newspapers. Hence, RedEye (the brainchild of Tribune Co., which owns
The Times) -- and Red Streak, published by the rival Sun-Times.</TE>
<TE>   Both Reds are 40-page tabloids. Both sell for 25 cents -- or they
will once their owners stop giving so many of them away as
get-acquainted free samples. Both have a lot of sports, entertainment
listings, eye-catching graphics and celebrities, celebrities,
celebrities. Both recycle material from their parent publications. In
both, most stories are short -- designed for someone with the
attention of a gnat.</TE>
<TE>   RedEye made its philosophy clear on the cover of its first issue,
which consisted mostly of a large-type list of the "Top 10 reasons to
read this newspaper" -- and then gave only nine reasons (not,
presumably, because the editors could think of only nine, but
because, as No. 9 put it -- in what passes for humor in RedEye --
"Even our Top 10 lists are made to save you time").</TE>
<TE>   RedEye's back-page Red Hot feature in that issue told eager
readers where they could buy a fried Twinkie -- "impaled on a stick
and frozen until firm, then dipped in a batter similar to that used
to fry fish." (Yum, yum.)</TE>
<TE>   The next day's RedEye featured a column by a young man bemoaning
the excruciating "pressure" he felt on a subway when he suddenly
realized, "I am, without a doubt, the best-looking person on this
train."</TE>
<TE>   The column ends -- mercifully -- when a woman "undeniably better
looking than me" gets on five stops later, and he offers to give her
"a few tips on keeping cool when everyone starts to gawk."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, I thought, RedEye is trying for some of the irony that has
made the Onion such a hit with younger readers.</TE>
<TE>   Nope. There, in Issue 4, was an interview with Onion editor Robert
Siegel, who "recently sat down with RedEye editors for a burger and
some probing questions," the paper said.</TE>
<TE>   "When did you realize how big the Onion was?" read one of the
probing questions.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you get a lot of resumes?" was another.</TE>
<TE>   And Red Streak?</TE>
<TE>   The first issue had a story on the Washington-area sniper on Page
1 ... right above a Halloween story on inflatable pumpkins ...
adjacent to the earth-shattering news that Starbucks "wants you to
buy breakfast" ... surrounded by teaser photos on Sarah Jessica
Parker's new baby, Christina Aguilera's new album and Winona Ryder's
new shoplifting testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Red Streak does put news stories on Page 1, including those that
appeal to young readers -- one on the decline in online music sales,
for example, and another on the increase in cell-phone text
messaging.</TE>
<TE>   The RedEye front page usually has one big photo and several
smaller graphic devices, all referring to stories inside the paper.
(To be fair, early front pages did direct readers to stories on the
publication of Kurt Cobain's journals and the murder of rapper Jam
Master Jay.)</TE>
<TE>   Defining a demographic</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune struck first in what's being billed as the latest
skirmish in Chicago's long tradition of newspaper wars; the Sun-Times
leaped into combat only after word of RedEye leaked out.</TE>
<TE>   The Tribune is by far the more successful of the parent papers,
but the Sun-Times does better with younger readers in Chicago, and it
started Red Streak "to preserve the readership and deepen the
attachment" with those readers, as John Cruickshank, co-editor of Red
Streak, told me.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll stop giving the paper away and start charging for it when
RedEye does," he said. "If they branch out and start selling a lot of
papers beyond the downtown area, we'll do it too."</TE>
<TE>   Cruickshank concedes that "the notion that there is a demographic
18 to 34 is completely nuts. You go from someone just entering
college to someone with two kids, who may be on a second marriage and
a third job."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Red Streak is, in Cruickshank's words, "just another edition
of the Sun-Times," which is also a tabloid. But Joe Knowles,
co-editor of RedEye, says his paper is trying to be as different as
possible from the non-tabloid Tribune -- "fully separated from them,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Their differences notwithstanding, I think both reach-for-the-Red
tabloids underestimate and patronize their intended audience. Both
seem little more than byproducts of their owners' panicky
overreaction to a younger generation they clearly don't understand.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure how well the Red editors understand that generation,
either. After all, Cruickshank is 49; his co-editor, Michael Cook, is
50. Knowles is 44; his co-editor, Jane Hirt, is 35.</TE>
<TE>   Their staffs are generally younger, so maybe the staffs will
ultimately explain to their bosses that while today's
18-to-34-year-olds aren't as interested in news as their elders are,
they aren't morons.</TE>
<TE>   When I showed the first several issues of the two Red tabs to a
friend who's a 21-year-old college senior, his critique came quickly:
"Amazingly superficial ... bad writing, Maxim-esque irony that
doesn't quite work ... disturbingly random in what they consider
news."</TE>
<TE>   In their editors' note in the first issue of RedEye, Knowles and
Hirt promised a publication that would be "smartly edited,
attractively packaged and built for speed."</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, I guess one out of three isn't so bad.</TE>

<HD>Attack of the 40-foot ads</HD>
<DH>Promotions in the lobby, cheesy slides on screen, then
commercials. We paid $9 for this? Theater owners know we hate them,
but those ads aren't going away.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Debra Yaruss hates commercials. Especially at the movies, where she's
seen grainy, 40-foot versions of the same annoying ads she sees at
home on television. Standing with friends outside Irvine's Edwards 21
megaplex on a recent Sunday afternoon, the 33-year-old San Diego
resident says emphatically, "Commercials. Make. Me. Ill."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, she could arrive later to miss the ads, but then, she
figures, she might not get a seat, and besides, she never can tell
when the movie is actually going to start. Being forced into
commercial captivity has made her angry, she says. "I want to go see
a movie and not be assaulted by commercialism."</LD>
<LD>   Well, it's too late for that. Moviegoers across the country have
been increasingly bombarded by advertising over the past few years,
and not just in the theater. There are ads and promotions, marketing
surveys and product samples in the lobby, at the concession stand,
and even on the way in from the parking lot. In fact, Yaruss and her
friends had succumbed to marketing survey-takers working the weekend
crowd outside the megaplex. For a few Tootsie Roll Pops, they had
watched trailers and given their opinions to help movie studios
fine-tune pitches. A few booths away, marketers for a pain-relief
cream had Pete Rose in tow, looking for people to endorse the
product.</LD>
<TE>   For fans like Yaruss, this ubiquitous hard sell is transforming
the moviegoing experience, once regarded by cineastes as almost holy.
Unheard of even a few years ago, the "pre-show" at some theaters can
now last 25 minutes or longer, during which theater companies run
half a dozen non-movie-related ads (including one for the Los Angeles
Times) and four or five trailers for upcoming movies -- some of which
won't be released for nine months. Moviegoers like Yaruss don't know
who to blame: the studios, which have pressured theaters to add more
and longer trailers, or the theater owners, who have been coping with
financial woes by courting advertisers on screen and off.</TE>
<TE>   So far undaunted, people continue to go to the movies (this year's
box office is about to set records), and the Edwards megaplex is as
good a place as any to see how advertisers seek to take advantage of
that. The megaplex is owned by the world's largest theater chain,
Regal Entertainment Group. Last year Regal merged three bankrupt
movie houses (Edwards Theaters Inc., United Artists Theater Co. and
Regal Cinemas Corp.) and instituted an aggressive marketing campaign,
including hiring its own advertising sales force to round up more ads
to be shown in its theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Not all theaters run commercials. Decisions on the number of
trailers or commercials are made by individual theater owners. Art
houses and independent chains tend to have fewer ads. "It's a matter
of management style," said Milt Moritz, president of the California
chapter of the National Theater Owners Assn.</TE>
<TE>   For the Sunday matinee, each customer at Edwards 21 who had just
paid $6.50 to get in was given a promotional ticket for free
Raisinettes with the purchase of a Coke. In the airy and cavernous
atrium, light streamed down on a mid-lobby display of popcorn tubs,
and drinking cups advertised Coke and an upcoming movie, "The Wild
Thornberries." At the refreshment stand, popcorn bags carried ads for
United Way, Target stores and more movies.</TE>
<TE>   One patron said he admired Regal's creator, Colorado billionaire
Philip Anschutz. "If you look around," said Jim Chiate, 33, of Coto
de Caza, waving his arm around the lobby, "every inch in here is a
way for him to squeeze out more money." Chiate isn't irritated by the
commercials. "I'm not going to show up a half-hour early to watch
commercials," he said, "but if he wants to show commercials and get
paid for it, more power to him."</TE>
<TE>   Regulating start times</TE>
<TE>   So far only one organization, Commercial Alert, a nonprofit
founded by Ralph Nader, has officially protested the proliferation of
commercials in movie houses. The group has encouraged municipalities
to pass laws requiring theaters to tell people when the movies, not
the ads, start, and asks activists to fight back. Executive director
Gary Ruskin said no city has yet passed a law. But, he said, "we know
some people yell 'No commercials!' during movie ads."</TE>
<TE>   Less demonstrative moviegoers simply employ the avoidance
strategy, which requires guessing when the movie will actually start.
Take that recent Sunday, for instance. Those who arrived at the
advertised start time of 2:30 p.m. to see "Sweet Home Alabama"
settled in with a smattering of other folks while movie quizzes and
ads for Coke appeared on the screen. There was a pro-military
trailer, and several spots from Regal -- "We've got great jobs for
you!"</TE>
<TE>   "Call this number to advertise here." The patrons heard some nice
music followed by a suggestion that they pick up the CD after the
show at one of the stores in the surrounding mall.</TE>
<TE>   When the lights dim, the filmed commercials began for the Los
Angeles Times, the NBC fall series "American Dreams," Audi, T.J.
Maxx, Sprite and Coke.</TE>
<TE>   After five trailers for upcoming attractions, an ear-jolting Dolby
sound ad and a stomach-churning, computer-generated roller-coaster
commercial urging people to buy more Coke and candy, "Sweet Home
Alabama" began. The theater was full. The time now was 3:05 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Like Yaruss, many people say it's the commercials, and not
necessarily the trailers, that drive them nuts. Trailers are "the
only way I find out about movies," says Yaruss' friend, Alina Sorkin,
30, of Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she says, "You get sick of the repetition, of hearing all
the best jokes in the trailer. It can ruin the movie."</TE>
<TE>   The women thought it would be fun to give their opinions of
upcoming trailers when they were approached by employees of Action
Entertainment Talk, a marketing company hired by several movie
studios. They told the survey-takers they thought the trailer for the
sequel "Analyze That" looked too much like the first movie, "Analyze
This." Leo Lowenthal, an Action Entertainment Talk employee, said the
survey helps studios like Disney, Miramax and Paramount to gauge
reaction and make fixes to trailers and movies as much as six months
before their release.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers love moviegoers. Not only do they represent a broad
demographic, they also have money and have shown they don't mind
spending it. Elsewhere around the country, advertisers have hawked
cell phones and shampoo in and around movie theaters. The military
has plans to set up recruiting kiosks in theaters. Regal plans to
install technology, and use its 5,800 screens during off-peak hours
to show concerts, and religious, business and sporting events.
Commercials may also be shown on the plasma screens now used in some
lobbies for trailers.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards from Yaruss and her friends, employees from a
marketing firm were asking people to try a pain-relief cream called
Relief RX. If they liked it, their testimonial would be videotaped
and maybe shown on television. For participating, they got a tube of
cream and a handshake from Pete Rose, the major league hit king
denied a spot in baseball's Hall of Fame because of his alleged
gambling activities. At the moment, Rose, who endorses the product,
looked listless, hunched over in a chair, staring at the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Advertising consultants say the commercial assault is only going
to get more sophisticated. Already some theaters allow advertisers to
target the audience by movie rating and will soon be using the
digital technology to target consumers by ZIP Code or the type of
movie being shown.</TE>
<TE>   Regal plans change</TE>
<TE>   To lure back the moviegoers who arrive late to avoid the ads,
advertisers are trying to make their spots as entertaining as the
trailers.</TE>
<TE>   And Regal plans pre-show reforms starting early next year, said
Kurt Hall, CEO of Regal Cinemedia, the subsidiary that oversees
advertising. Instead of cheesy slides for local advertisers and
rolling stock commercials that run into the advertised show time,
Hall said the chain will distribute a prepackaged 20-minute digital
pre-show to its theaters. "The program will run until the advertised
show time," Hall said. "If a movie starts at 7, we're going to start
our show at 20 minutes of 7." Roughly 65% of the show will be
educational and informative shorts provided by NBC and other media
entities, and only 35% will be advertising, a spokesman said. Hall
declined to elaborate on the business reasons for the reforms, but
said the pre-shows will be digitally targeted by movie rating and ZIP
Codes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our primary goal is to just provide a good entertainment
experience for our customers, and a good marketing platform to
advertise brands and products," he said. In the end, viewers like
Yaruss may find their dilemma more palatable but fundamentally
unchanged. "The deal we're making with the patron," Hall said, "is
that they can decide what they want to do -- and risk getting a good
seat or not."</TE>

<HD>The bestseller they couldn't sell</HD>
<DH>Robert Redford and son James spent years trying to turn
Tony Hillerman's Navajo mysteries into movies. Then along came PBS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even a major player like Robert Redford runs into problems getting
films made. Never mind the Oscar, the Sundance Festival, the hits:
For 14 years, he's owned the rights to the majority of the 15 mystery
novels penned by Tony Hillerman revolving around the exploits of two
New Mexican Navajo police detectives: Officer Jim Chee of the Navajo
Tribal Police and Lt. Joe Leaphorn.</LD>
<LD>   Since "Skinwalkers" was published in 1986, Hillerman's books have
consistently hit bestseller lists and sold millions of copies. But
Hollywood didn't share Redford's passion for the police thrillers.</LD>
<LD>   The actor-producer-director finally found a home for this pet
project, however, thanks to his friendship with PBS President Pat
Mitchell, who sits on the board of directors of Redford's Sundance
Institute. While Redford was looking for an appropriate home for the
Hillerman books, PBS was in the process of radically changing its
long-running series "Mystery!," which has showcased only
British-produced thrillers for the past 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   Mitchell pushed the series out of its regular, Thursday-evening
time slot last year, turned it into a limited series last summer and
issued an edict that she wanted to introduce American programming on
the franchise. American writers' work have been adapted for the
series -- Elizabeth George lives in Huntington Beach -- but the
stories have been set outside the U.S. At this time, no other
American authors whose work is set in America are in line to be
adapted.</TE>
<TE>   Next Sunday, PBS is premiering Hillerman's murder-mystery
"Skinwalkers" as an "American Mystery! Special."</TE>
<TE>   The 90-minute whodunit features a Native American cast including
Wes Studi as Leaphorn and Adam Beach as Chee, and was directed by
Native American Chris Eyre ("Smoke Signals"). James Redford, son of
executive producer Redford, adapted the screenplay.</TE>
<TE>   "They [Hillerman's books] were so complexly difficult to mount,"
Robert Redford says. "There was no support for it. I had initially
seen it as a series of films like the old Charlie Chan mysteries.
Every 18 months this little movie would come out. They would not be
big or pretentious. They would be humble little efforts that would
deliver something diverse and new to an audience, but it would have
to have humor and characters. So that's how it was conceived."</TE>
<TE>   Redford did get Hillerman's "A Dark Wind" made as a feature film
in 1991. He was executive producer, it was directed by acclaimed
documentary filmmaker Errol Morris and starred Lou Diamond Phillips
and Fred Ward as the American Indian policemen. The film, says
Redford, wasn't any good and wasn't released.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a false start," Redford says. "It was miscast. It was
ill-conceived and I didn't think it was the right beginning for the
series. It wasn't distributed."</TE>
<TE>   Hillerman never saw that film but recalls that Redford asked if he
wanted his name taken off the credits. "I didn't care really," the
author says. "That book was very difficult to make a movie out of. It
had a very complicated plot. So did 'Skinwalkers.' "</TE>
<TE>   Redford acknowledges he was taken aback by how difficult it was to
bring Hillerman's tales to the big screen "because of the perception
of Native Americans not being commercial territory. Second, one
couldn't see the larger picture of value of introducing two new
characters who are fresh and audiences could adopt. They couldn't see
that idea. It was very hard to convince people, so we lost a lot of
years."</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, Redford did get a director interested in
"Skinwalkers." Although he won't mention the director's name, Redford
says, "He was very neurotic and was afraid of dry territory and
wouldn't go down to the reservation because something about it made
it uneasy to him. So it was pretty clear that the handwriting was on
the wall and it was never going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Hillerman respects Redford's passion for his novels and
never-say-die attitude. The author recalls that before Redford
approached him, an independent producer had optioned one of his
books.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do anything with it, but he renewed the option and
ended up owning the television rights to Leaphorn and Chee, so that
meant no one was going to option the books," Hillerman says. "When
Redford came along, he wanted to option them. So in effect, I had to
buy the TV rights for those two guys, which he put up the money for.
He optioned them and he kept trying, and so there we stood."</TE>
<TE>   Passion for the culture</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Hillerman says, other movie producers approached
his agent about obtaining the rights to his novels.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not much of a movie buff and I thought if anybody makes a
film, I'd rather it be Redford. Redford has a long-standing interest
in the Southwestern tribes. He has a lot of good friends among the
Hopis and other tribes too."</TE>
<TE>   Hillerman really isn't surprised by the reluctance of Hollywood to
embrace his novels. "When I tried to get my first novel published" --
"The Blessing Way" in 1970 --"I had an agent who was selling
nonfiction for me and doing pretty well with it. I wrote 'The
Blessing Way' and she told me the only chance of selling it was to
get rid of all the Indian stuff -- it slowed down the book. I told
her that was the reason I was writing the book, so I just sent it off
to an editor myself. I am not knocking her, she was a good agent."</TE>
<TE>   Although Redford grew up in Van Nuys, he has long had a love of
American Indian culture, and that was his road into producing the
Hillerman stories.</TE>
<TE>   "To be able to do a project that exposes something about our
original culture boils down to a very simple equation for me. If you
take the landscape and you take the culture, you can't separate them.
Then you add the word 'tradition' and you have something unique," he
says. "We have always looked at that culture in almost purely
symbolic ways to satisfy the need of our Hollywood movies -- where
the Indians are going to be the bad guys against the cowboys, the
good guys. Lately, that has kind of changed, but it has always been a
look at the culture in a sort of superficial symbolic way. So I
thought what an opportunity here to present both the old and new
[American Indian culture] because the new just hasn't been presented
-- just a little here and a little there. This is all pretty new
territory and it's amazing."</TE>
<TE>   James Redford, who shares his dad's passion for the Southwest,
wrote the first draft of the "Skinwalkers" script about eight years
ago, and then another draft five or six years later.</TE>
<TE>   "In between, it was confronting the reality that getting an
all-Native American cast financed above a certain budget was just
really hard to do. We are not idiots about the commercial realities.
But I think what happens is that we all identify what we are
convinced is a sure-fire thing. It was a bestselling author and a
mystery genre. But I was sort of surprised there was as much
resistance."</TE>
<TE>   Especially, James Redford says, because of the popularity of such
American Indian-themed movies as "Dances With Wolves," Disney's
"Pocahontas" and Eyre's art-house success, "Smoke Signals," as well
as the TV series "Northern Exposure," which featured many American
Indian actors and examined the Native American culture in the
American Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw all of these indications it was time [for "Skinwalkers']
and room for this," he says.</TE>
<TE>   PBS' Mitchell, a former producer at CNN Productions, first
collaborated with Redford a decade ago on a TBS documentary on Native
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   She recalls that even then, he was talking to her about the
Hillerman books.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, she adds, she would ask him what was happening
with "Skinwalkers."</TE>
<TE>   About two years ago, Mitchell was thinking of reinventing
"Mystery!" by adding some American fare to the mix.</TE>
<TE>   When she spoke with the general manager of WGBH -- the PBS
affiliate in Boston that produces "Mystery!" and "Masterpiece
Theatre" -- he expressed admiration for Hillerman's stories. "I said
to him, 'I might be able to help you.' That's how it started. I
called Bob right away."</TE>
<TE>   'PBS stands pretty tall'</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell says "Skinwalkers" should have a built-in audience among
fans of the mystery genre "that might not necessarily be a built-in
audience for material about Native Americans, which is traditionally
challenging material to get an audience for. Having Robert Redford's
name, having Tony Hillerman's built-in fan club is certainly going to
help."</TE>
<TE>   Eyre, who had developed "Smoke Signals" at Sundance, got involved
in the project last year.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that Bob said to me, and really I meditated on quite a
bit, is that he was interested in the books from the beginning
because they weren't about anything but Indian characters in a
contemporary setting and an interesting story. I think that's its
biggest value. I was interested in doing a movie that was purely
entertaining, and it was PBS and we were trying to reach a broad
American audience."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Redford feels the marriage of his sensibility and PBS' is a
good one. "It coincides with the Sundance mission of discovering,
honoring, nurturing and exposing new voices and new talent with
diverse options," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at America and what we are supposed to be, we are
supposed to be championing the word 'freedom' and part of freedom
involves the ability to be diverse," Redford says. "Sundance was
founded 21 years ago to try to create a mechanism to protect [freedom
and diversity] and nurture it. But you also need somewhere to put it.
So it has been amazing for me to watch over the years the collapse or
the shrinking down to nothing of the [TV] channels. PBS stands pretty
tall."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell says they are hoping to do more Hillerman projects. "We
have already commissioned another script, 'The Thief of Time,' and in
fact Bob has even indicated he might want to direct this one."</TE>

<HD>Hope: Last Refuge of the Helpless</HD>
<DH>Maybe the shift in the balance of power in Washington will
get the nation moving again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's downright jarring to read about the consolidation of power in
Washington. All that flexing muscle and sharpening of knives, so real
and dynamic in the capital, seems weirdly discordant with the general
frame of mind elsewhere in the land.</LD>
<LD>   So for a moment let's set aside the certainty of our cynicism and
allow that we could be in for a surprise, and not just the obvious.</LD>
<LD>   As the result of a net switch of 1% or so of the seats in Congress
and because the substance of pivotal campaigns was far spongier than
the mandate they created, George W. Bush has more maneuverability and
fewer promises to keep than any president in memory: power, pure and
simple. It appears that opposition Democrats, too, have been
energized. Losing where it counts, but not by so much, they stand to
lose little else by rousing themselves. Their ideas and their leaders
weren't defeated -- the lack of them was, which I gather is regarded
as a door thrown open to opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   For the moment at least, our dreary gridlocked politics have
picked up motion. Scary and exhilarating, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   Remember that quaint idea about power having a purpose beyond the
merely tactical and defensive? If this should reemerge as fact, not
artifact, in the nation's capitol, we might find ourselves having to
set aside our griping about politicians always lagging timidly behind
the public.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, the reigning mood outside of Washington, at least where
I live, has less to do with taking control of the future than being
powerless against it. Centrist politics have become accepted as an
excuse for inaction, or for baby steps that take us not down the
middle of the road but in wandering circles.</TE>
<TE>   Pollsters have it wrong when they ask Americans whether the
country is on the right track. The more telling question is: Do you
feel there is anything you can do about it? Asked in light of a score
or more of long-ignored and deepening social challenges, the answer:
Not really.</TE>
<TE>   Health care, traffic congestion, business scandals, Social
Security, immigration, budget deficits, environmental sustainability,
classroom overcrowding -- the only consensus has been that problems
are bigger than we have imagination and energy to tackle them.</TE>
<TE>   Take just one: The whole country seems flat-footed against the
power of corporations -- whether the companies we work for or those
that produce the goods and services we consume. Despite the inanities
about the marketplace answering to consumers, I don't know anyone who
doesn't feel that it's the other way around these days, with the
possible exception of a longshoreman or two.</TE>
<TE>   Thus there has been far more resignation than indignation over the
unfolding of the most extravagantly expensive crime spree in our
history. Too few people believe in the willingness, or even the
ability, of our leaders and institutions to rein in the multinational
overlords.</TE>
<TE>   When the government caved in and settled with Microsoft's
monopoly, for instance, many consumers reacted as if the case was
doomed all along. "Microsoft is everywhere, aren't they?" as one
shopper summed it up for The Times. "Why even bother trying to fight
it?"</TE>
<TE>   That's why pollsters almost always find that people are more
confident about their own lives and the future of their neighborhoods
than they are when asked about the fortunes of the larger nation. At
least in our backyards, we still feel some command over destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Now this sudden celebration of old-fashioned power in Washington
raises the possibility of a change beyond momentary ideology in the
course of our politics. As soon as we start hearing that our
challenges aren't too big to tackle, we just might find politicians
trying to outdo each other with some fresh ideas to meet them. After
all, that cat has been snoozing in the bag for a good long while now.
Who knows what frisky critter may emerge if the strings come untied.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of "Why bother trying?" we might be astonished to hear,
"Why not try?"</TE>
<TE>   Let's remember that no small number of our politicians are more
imaginative in private conversations when they speak of what the
nation should be doing than they are in public pronouncements of what
cannot be done.</TE>
<TE>   It is every generation's conceit to believe that it is writing
history in bold type. Maybe we're about to. No harm in hoping. Surely
there is great instability, plenty of hidden fissures in the social
bedrock, when the most powerful nation in the world is populated by
so many citizens who feel powerless.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Inefficient: I was mistaken last week in a column that challenged
conventional views about the benefits of never-ending economic
efficiencies. In the movie "Duck Soup," it was Chico Marx
masquerading as Groucho, not Groucho himself, who said, "Who are you
gonna believe, me or your own eyes?"</TE>

<HD>Eastside Pols Lose Clout</HD>
<DH>Villaraigosa's strength has the old guard flailing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sleazy tactics began sooner than expected in the Los Angeles City
Council's 14th District, where former Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa is campaigning to unseat Nick Pacheco. But amid the
understandable outrage generated by the racist attack one Pacheco
backer unleashed, there is cause for optimism. The wannabe politico
responsible for the ugliness may have sounded the death knell for a
worn-out Eastside political "machine."</LD>
<LD>   Villaraigosa no sooner announced his candidacy for the seat in
March's elections than Ricardo A. Torres II, a law school classmate
of Pacheco's, sent district voters mailers attacking the former
Assembly speaker. The most detestable accused Villaraigosa of
ignoring Latinos at the behest of his "gringo" advisors. A second
rehashed "womanizer" accusations. Torres boasted to The Times that he
would raise $500,000 to send out more mailers.</LD>
<LD>   Pacheco denied responsibility for the mailers and asked Torres to
stop sending them out. When Torres refused, Pacheco supporters such
as Mayor James K. Hahn, City Council President Alex Padilla and Los
Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca joined the chorus of public
disapproval. The sheriff withdrew his endorsement of Pacheco, saying
Torres' mailers were too "divisive from the standpoint of race."</LD>
<TE>   Torres cracked under the pressure by the end of last week. He
announced the mailers would stop but refused to apologize and warned
that he might resume his attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Torres' sophomoric high jinks hurt not only Pacheco but also other
political activists on the Eastside. They showed the city just how
weak and desperate the clique that once dominated Latino politics in
L.A. had become.</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders persist in referring to those who once orbited around
former 14th District Councilman Richard Alatorre as a "machine." But
clique is more accurate. The group's cohesion is based less on
political patronage than on personal relationships. And it was common
practice for young pols in the group to be told when it was their
"turn" to run for public office.</TE>
<TE>   The first to buck that was Gloria Molina, who beat a clique-backed
candidate for an Assembly seat in 1982. Since then she has supported
other dissident candidates, generating talk of "two Eastside
machines." But with Molina's ascension to county supervisor in 1991,
her political base shifted to the increasingly Latino suburbs of
eastern L.A. County, another indication of the Eastside's fading
influence.</TE>
<TE>   When Alatorre left office amid a corruption scandal, leadership
passed to state Sen. Richard Polanco. But Polanco's recent departure
from the Legislature because of term limits created a leadership void
on the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   The speed and ease with which Villaraigosa grew as a citywide
political power is proof of the clique's diminished power. He emerged
from Molina's circle a decade ago, and his rapid rise, first to
Assembly speaker, then as a serious mayoral candidate and now as a
threat to an incumbent councilman, scares the Eastsiders. He can
challenge them in their barrio base and is also attractive to
non-Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   But Villaraigosa is just one of a handful of independent Latino
pols who illustrate the Eastside clique's irrelevancy. Another is
City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo, elected citywide in 1999 in his first
run for office. And still another is City Council President Alex
Padilla of the San Fernando Valley. Pacheco wanted the council
president's job badly but couldn't muster the votes to win.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla helped defeat Valley secession and may soon see his old
mentor, Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, win a newly drawn council district
in the Valley. If that happens, Latinos in the Valley won't ever have
to follow the Eastside clique's lead again.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Eastside old guard's realization that a Villaraigosa
victory could be their last stand that has adherents rallying to
Pacheco -- and at times striking out stupidly.</TE>

<HD>'Tough on Crime' May Backfire</HD>
<DH>Mexico won't extradite fugitives facing life terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan M. Miller</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California district attorneys are furious because hundreds of violent
criminals use Mexico as their refuge to escape arrest. According to
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, Los Angeles alone
seeks more than 60 murder suspects who have crossed the border. But
part of the problem is California's unwillingness to adapt its
sentencing laws.</LD>
<LD>   In October 2001, the Mexican Supreme Court ruled that any sentence
of life imprisonment violated the Mexican constitution's protection
against unusual punishment, and therefore Mexico may not extradite
any individual to the United States who would face a possible life
sentence.</LD>
<LD>   The decision may sound peculiar to U.S. ears, and it goes far
beyond European and Mexican positions that bar extradition to face
the death penalty, but it does have some foundation. There is a long
tradition in European and Latin American jurisprudence that
imprisonment exists not for punishment but to protect society and for
rehabilitation of the offender. According to the Mexican Supreme
Court, a life sentence fails to recognize a prisoner's right to
rehabilitation.</LD>
<TE>   The decision is a setback for California law enforcement. Until
the late 1990s, Mexico rarely extradited its own citizens to the
U.S., invoking a clause in the U.S.-Mexico treaty that allows it to
deny extradition and conduct the prosecution of its own citizens in
Mexico. That approach led to many failed prosecutions and many light
sentences. But improved relations with the U.S. had led to a sharp
increase in Mexican extraditions in the years just before the 2001
Supreme Court decision.</TE>
<TE>   California is the state most affected by the Mexican Supreme Court
decision because, unlike in other border states, law in California
often leaves prosecutors no option but to seek a life term for a
serious charge.</TE>
<TE>   However, California has postured rather than dealing with the
problem. Law enforcement authorities complain of a corrupt Mexican
system that offers a haven for murderers, and some district attorneys
have simply stopped making extradition requests. The state
Legislature has passed a resolution calling for Washington to
pressure the Mexican government to change its policy.</TE>
<TE>   But Mexico has an independent Supreme Court. Rather than grumbling
and seeking Washington's aid, California needs to look for solutions
that work within Mexican legal traditions and serve justice in the
U.S. cases.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican law does provide for 60-year prison sentences for a range
of serious crimes. California's legislators could easily pass a law
providing that any life sentence imposed on an individual extradited
from Mexico shall automatically end after 60 years of imprisonment,
if required by Mexico as a condition for extradition. While this may
give fugitives in Mexico a special advantage, California prosecutors
have long offered assurances not to seek the death penalty in order
to obtain extraditions from other countries.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican Supreme Court decision may well be mistaken,
especially given that life imprisonment often allows a possibility of
parole based on rehabilitation. But California cannot count on
changing the case law of an independent neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration has a choice: look tough on crime and let
murderers go free or recognize Mexico's sovereignty and accept a
60-year sentence as the maximum.</TE>

<HD>George Bush's Big Brother</HD>
<DH>Orwell would recognize the plan to monitor citizens using
databases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Turley</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In George Orwell's book "1984," the government used "doublespeak" to
change the meaning of words to make the horrific appear commonplace.
Thus the war department was called the Ministry of Love, and citizens
were instructed that "slavery is freedom."</LD>
<LD>   Long thought dead, it now appears that Orwell is busy at work in
the darkest recesses of the Bush administration and its new
Information Awareness Office.</LD>
<LD>   It is a title that is truly a masterpiece of doublespeak. After
all, who could be against greater awareness of information?</LD>
<TE>   What was not known until last week was what information the
administration is seeking and how it wants to acquire it. With no
public notice or debate, the administration has been working on the
creation of the world's largest computer system and database, one
with the ability to track every credit card purchase, travel
reservation, medical treatment and common transaction by every
citizen in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   It has been the dream of every petty despot in history: the
ability to track citizens in real time and to reconstruct their
associations and interests.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the latest product from the good people at DARPA.</TE>
<TE>   The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has been working on
this project, and the pending homeland security bill would lay the
foundation for the system.</TE>
<TE>   In a little-discussed provision, the bill combines huge government
databases into a single, massive system. It further weakens
protections under the Privacy Act of 1974, opening the door for DARPA
to develop a prototype system.</TE>
<TE>   With a requested $200-million down payment, the "Total Information
Awareness" system could allow the government to study the purchases
and activities of citizens to isolate people for further
investigation, feeding names into the new massive surveillance system
constructed after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   This project is the brainchild of a man who hardly needs a new
technological boost into infamy: retired Vice Adm. and former
National Security Advisor John M. Poindexter.</TE>
<TE>   Poindexter's previous noteworthy public service was as the master
architect behind the Iran-Contra scandal, the criminal conspiracy to
sell arms to a terrorist nation, Iran, in order to surreptitiously
fund an unlawful clandestine project in Nicaragua.</TE>
<TE>   Along with various other Reagan administration officials,
Poindexter was convicted of five felony counts of lying to Congress,
destroying documents and obstructing Congress in its investigation.
He was sentenced to jail but was saved on a technicality: a poorly
crafted immunity grant by Congress that required some evidence to be
suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   One would think that a convicted felon who escaped by a
technicality hardly would be welcome in the Bush administration. Yet
when asked about Poindexter's prior criminal conduct, President Bush
released a statement that he believed "Adm. Poindexter has served our
nation very well."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Poindexter is the perfect Orwellian figure for the
perfect Orwellian project. As a man convicted of falsifying and
destroying information, he will now be put in charge of gathering
information on every citizen. To add insult to injury, the citizens
will fund the very system that will reduce their lives to a
transparent fishbowl.</TE>
<TE>   What is most astonishing is the utter lack of public debate over
this project.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, the public has yielded large tracts of
constitutional territory that had been jealously guarded for
generations. Now we face the ultimate act of acquiescence in the face
of government demands.</TE>
<TE>   For more than 200 years, our liberties have been protected
primarily by practical barriers rather than constitutional barriers
to government abuse. Because of the sheer size of the nation and its
population, the government could not practically abuse a great number
of citizens at any given time. In the last decade, however, these
practical barriers have fallen to technology.</TE>
<TE>   This new, untapped power has been an irresistible temptation for
many like Poindexter, who has reportedly been working on such ideas
for years. Soon after Sept. 11, he appeared at the door of the
administration like a J. Edgar Hoover vacuum salesman, promising a
system that could digest huge amounts of information and produce
neatly packaged leads on suspected citizens.</TE>
<TE>   A government's desire for "Total Information Awareness" of its
citizens is nothing new. Our founders understood that the quality of
government is determined not by the powers given but by those denied
to it. A free society cannot be maintained under the continual
surveillance of its government.</TE>
<TE>   DARPA has finally brought us to a constitutional Rubicon. Yet all
that is required is for citizens to do nothing. DARPA will do the
rest.</TE>

Beach Chamber Music Society will jointly present a chamber music
festival in the beach city in the spring of 2003.</LD>

<HD>Irvine Foundation tightens its philanthropy belt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The James Irvine Foundation, long one of the state's leading donors
to social causes and the arts, is trimming its staff from 42
positions to 35 in the wake of hefty stock-market losses and plans a
strategic shift that will reduce its arts philanthropy.</LD>
<LD>   The first move in that shift: the termination of program director
Melanie Beene, the most senior of the foundation's three arts
staffers, who will leave her position at the end of the month.</LD>
<LD>   "We will definitely continue in the arts," said David Shaw, San
Francisco-based spokesman for the foundation, "but I think it will be
a more focused and smaller program in the future."</LD>
<TE>   The foundation will honor grants already announced, and no further
steps are expected until after the Irvine board meets in December,
Shaw said. But he added that the foundation's arts grants and overall
grant total -- $11.5 million and $63 million, respectively, in 2002
-- will probably shrink in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Foundation was established in 1937 by philanthropist
James Irvine, whose 110,000-acre ranch in Orange County was among the
largest private land holdings in the state. As recently as 1999, Shaw
said, its assets amounted to $1.7 billion. At most recent count, Shaw
said, the weak economy and stumbling stock market had cut that figure
to $1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's grant recipients in 2002 included the California
Institute for the Arts in Valencia ($750,000 over three years); the
Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego and the San Francisco Museum of
Contemporary Art ($600,000 each over three years); the Los
Angeles-based Ford Theatre Foundation ($450,000 over three years);
Los Angeles Opera ($300,000 over three years); the Cornerstone
Theatre Company ($300,000 over three years); the Pasadena-based
Armory Center for the Arts ($300,000 over three years); and
Venice-based L.A. Theatre Works ($250,000 over two years).</TE>

<HD>Malibu Stage ousts artistic director</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The surf looks rough at Malibu Stage Company.</LD>
<LD>   Charles Marowitz, a director and critic who created the small
oceanside company 12 years ago, has been asked to resign as the
group's artistic director. He said he is planning to take legal
action against the group's board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   The board voted 9-0 to oust Marowitz, said Chairman Geoff Ortiz,
citing "ongoing problems related to his behavior and his inability to
run the theater." He said Marowitz had received "verbal and written
admonishments," including one from Ortiz that warned Marowitz he
would not be invited to board meetings "if he didn't stop insulting
board members."</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe I don't suffer fools gladly," Marowitz said. "But there was
nothing in my contract that I had to be a sweet fellow."</TE>
<TE>   Marowitz said that the leader of the campaign against him was
Jackie Bridgeman, board president emeritus. He had compiled a list of
what he called Bridgeman's "infractions" in what he described as her
unofficial management of the company and said that he "intended to
submit the catalog at the next board meeting." But he added that he
was not informed of the Nov. 6 meeting. "I was never allowed to
defend myself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bridgeman denied that she was the anti-Marowitz ringleader. But,
she said, "you can't have a discussion with him. He just yells."</TE>
<TE>   Marowitz had prepared a 2003 season including a Martin Sheen
production of a play about Cesar Chavez. Ortiz said a search for a
new artistic director has not yet begun.</TE>

<LD>Deborah Brockus' dance empire is about to expand again.</LD>
<LD>   Brockus already runs a locally based jazz-dance ensemble (the
Brockus Project Dance Company) and produces a multi-company showcase
called "Spectrum: Dance in L.A." four times a year at the Ivar
Theatre in Hollywood. (Spectrum #13 runs Saturday and next Sunday.)
This year, she also launched a teenage "Spectrum" titled "New
Perspectives" (penciled in for two new editions at the Ivar in 2003)
and "Caught Between," a collaborative multimedia Ivar event also
scheduled to repeat next year. Besides these public performances, she
arranges master classes for the local dance community with major
visiting companies.</LD>
<LD>   If all that weren't enough, Brockus will be running a new
quarterly series called "Split" at the Alex Theatre in Glendale
starting Jan. 10. "Split" teams three locally based choreographers or
companies with one from elsewhere: Robert Gilliam, Jamie Nichols and
Brockus' own troupe as the home team and the Forces of Nature company
from New York as the honored guest on the inaugural program.</LD>
<TE>   Even before this announcement, Brockus was presenting more local
dance than any other individual or institution. Now, nobody even
comes close.</TE>

<LD>"Retrofuturism: The Car Design of J Mays" focuses on nine cars, all
designed by Mays and his teams.</LD>
<LD>   Audi Avus Quattro concept vehicle, 1991. Named for the 1930s Avus
racetrack in Berlin, it was never intended for production, but its
form led to the development of Audi's TT (1995), designed by Mays'
colleague Freeman Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   Volkswagen Concept One, 1994. Using the geometry of three
truncated, intersecting circles, the Concept One was developed to
revive Volkswagen's most successful car, the Beetle.</LD>
<TE>   Ford Mondeo ST 220 production vehicle, 2002. Produced only for the
European market, the Mondeo links the elite cars Mays designed for
Audi with his more populist-oriented work.</TE>
<TE>   Ford O21C concept vehicle, 1999. Named for a Pantone color sample,
the car is a collaboration between Mays and product designer Marc
Newson, and incorporates a variety of Newsonian touches, including a
steering wheel that echoes his design for a coat hook.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Thunderbird concept vehicle, 1999. Introduced 45 years after
the debut of the original, the new T-Bird has smoother, simpler
curved details.</TE>
<TE>   Ford 24.7 concept vehicle, 2000. In an attempt to transfer today's
communication technology into an automobile, the 24.7 replaces analog

<HD>Music from life's mess</HD>
<DH>Chaos and beauty compete on Brad Mehldau's 'Largo,' an
album that defies labels. Is it still jazz? The pianist doesn't think
it matters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynell George</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As evening crackles to life on Hollywood Boulevard, Brad Mehldau
ventures out. Just like old times.</LD>
<LD>   He wandered away from this old, cacophonous neighborhood not so
long ago, but as he winds across the Knitting Factory's crowded main
stage, he slips right back into it, its rhythm and attitude.
California casual, his brick-red shirt untucked, rumpled, his dark
hair tousled, the pianist appears ready to retire to a wrap-around
porch with a cold beer, just in time to catch the first neon
flickering on.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, as if teasing out the illusion, he walks past the piano,
reaching instead for two mallets, then hovers over the vibes. Out
tumbles a spacey, herky-jerky intro that builds into a tricked-out
version of Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Wave" before drifting into the
Beatles' "Mother Nature's Son."</LD>
<TE>   Arranged around him are shiny tools for improvisation: two upright
basses. Two drum kits. The piano. And, through the evening, a parade
of brass and woodwinds. Mehldau is hip to hip with his utility men,
bassist Larry Grenadier and drummer Jorge Rossy, long the backbone of
his top-flight jazz trio.</TE>
<TE>   On this fall night, drummer Matt Chamberlain and bassist Darek
"Oles" Oleszkiewicz add another layer of texture and sass to a set of
compositions that elude easy descriptors. The band, which changes
incarnations throughout the evening, takes its turns through the
disparate cuts that make up Mehldau's latest recording, "Largo" --
part valentine, part journal of sonic sketches of his life in Los
Angeles in the late '90s. This performance feels more like a
no-holds-barred workshop than a prosaic "let's toss the solos around
and sail to a close" club set.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight offers a through-the-keyhole glimpse of raw improvisation
that just a few hundred people -- musicians, fans, curious bystanders
-- are lucky enough to witness. Mehldau and his
producer-conductor-compatriot, Jon Brion, are in effect sketching as
they go.</TE>
<TE>   Out saunters "Dusty McNugget," a strutting, loose-hipped original
that has been getting a fair share of crossover airplay for something
from a "jazz album." Angular, thudding with acoustic drum-and-bass
and Mehldau's own sly, funkified approach, it all feels buoyed by the
spirits of both Thelonious Monk and Frank Zappa. Its humor is
intrinsic, and never winking.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing forward, the band disassembles the recognizable -- say,
Radiohead's "Paranoid Android" -- or pares "Dear Prudence" down to
its chassis.</TE>
<TE>   A gleeful Brion, in turquoise suit coat and bird-nest coif, serves
as antic ringmaster, trapezing from role to role. Conductor, sideman,
cheerleader, he leaves no perspective untried, whether banging on the
vibes as if on water pipes or crouched in a corner for a kid's-eye
view.</TE>
<TE>   Horn and woodwind players make their way on and off stage, and
Mehldau is letting it all go: "I don't know who they are, but it
doesn't matter. They know who they are," he jokes, his face slightly
bewildered. About midway through, he scratches his mussed head: "I've
never done this thing before. A set list ... I've never had such a
big band to introduce," he marvels.</TE>
<TE>   His face is relaxed, alight, as if all of it is quickly sinking
in, happening right before his eyes. He's careful not to blink.</TE>
<TE>   In select company</TE>
<TE>   So where is jazz going?" Musicians and critics have been pulling
at this for decades. A miffed Thelonious Monk once fired back a
response both as direct and elliptical his playing: "I don't know
where it's going. Maybe it's going to hell. You can't make anything
go anywhere. It just happens."</TE>
<TE>   The heart of jazz is the rush of what happens in a moment. That is
the essence of improvisation, the excitement of pushing forward
without signposts. Jazz itself is in a moment of improvisation,
struggling with reinvention. As jazz, the marketing category,
struggles for footing, Mehldau, at 32,  has found his. He's among a
small young coterie of straight-ahead jazz musicians -- the
Marsalises, Joshua Redman -- who sell records, mount relatively
ambitious tours and enjoy some crossover recognition. He has recorded
nearly a dozen discs that mix solid original compositions with
creatively realized standards. He has an articulate, warm style that
is infused as much by classical training as by street chops. His
improvisational intuition pushes him toward the murky and uncharted,
but he always finds a way back. So what's got some jazz purists'
noses bent out of shape?</TE>
<TE>   "Largo" bends expectations about what jazz is. Although Downbeat
magazine featured Mehldau on its September cover, heralding his "New
Jazz of a New Generation," in the same issue's "The Hotbox" column,
the new album didn't rise above "good": " 'Largo' starts with a
lovely 'When It Rains,' then, like the rain, starts to sink into the
ground," wrote critic John McDonough. Added Jim Macine, "The
track-to-track change of dynamics and instruments becomes
disjunctive."</TE>
<TE>   But that is just what Mehldau's getting at: that life -- and jazz
for that matter -- is as much about mess and chaos as beauty and
symmetry. Although "Largo" might appear to be a far-flung departure
from the intuitive three-way conversation of his trio, it still feels
very much like a direct relation. Yes, he's got his "street creds" in
order -- a stint at the New School studying with drummer Jimmy Cobb
and pianist Junior Mance; spots on the bill with Redman, Christopher
Holliday, Christian McBride -- and endured endless comparisons to
Bill Evans (both pianists are white and have been chased by heroin
addiction), but Mehldau has long been hinting at this more expansive
inclination. His albums have always provided tasteful settings for
Porter or Rodgers &amp; Hart tunes, but Radiohead and Nick Drake have
been comfortable there as well.</TE>
<TE>   Going the way of his instincts, Mehldau demonstrates that one
sound can dovetail into the next, that borders and labels, if not
superfluous, are arbitrary.</TE>
<TE>   A life-altering excursion</TE>
<TE>   A WEEK or so after his Knitting Factory Hollywood gig, Mehldau's
back in Manhattan. He's installed in a hip hotel, Le Parker Meridien
and seems slightly weary, with a post-bronchitis cough. That doesn't
stop him from sneaking a cigarette, then cranking up the AC to clear
the lingering smoke.</TE>
<TE>   He's been putting the finishing touches on a new album with just
the trio. Fresh off a week at the Village Vanguard, playing with
Grenadier and Rossy, he'll be heading off to Europe for a month or so
of dates. But first he'll duck upstate to spend a few days at home
with his wife, Fleurine, and his baby daughter, Eden.</TE>
<TE>   The showcases at Knitting Factory were experimental forays to see
just how "Largo's" on-disc setup might play out live. Playing with
that revolving lineup in the city that incubated many of the
compositions had plenty of resonance for Mehldau. Those sketches
marked the end of years of hard living.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I actually went out there [in 1996] and
wound up in drug rehab," he says, settling into the suite's
stiff-backed love seat. "Before that, everything was in kind of
shambles in my life. I stayed in a place for three months in Pasadena
and then I figured, 'I'll just stay out here for a while and see how
it goes.' "</TE>
<TE>   He played dates with the late Billy Higgins and got to know
bassist Darek Oles. He also fell into a regular session with the guys
who played "The Tonight Show" gig. But what arrested his attention
was a weekly "happening" at a Fairfax district cabaret called Largo,
where he met producer Brion.</TE>
<TE>   Brion's Friday-night show became Mehldau's new habit.</TE>
<TE>   He says he was struck as much by Brion's daring as his
intuitiveness. "I think the first time I heard him he was playing
electric guitar, with a real sort of rock sound. Just all alone
[with] all these real sort of sonic things going on. And then he
launched into a Cole Porter song, I think it was 'I Love You.' ...
And it was startling the way he was sort of reconfiguring it.... Then
[he did] some of his own original music too. These beautiful songs
that just drew me in on an emotional level. It was kind of an
experience that happens less and less as you get older because you
get jaded. Where you really feel blown away." Encountering Brion
reawakened something old and familiar about his connection to music.
Not his classical training or his tour of New York's jazz clubs, but
what was beaming out of the radio during his formative years --
Steely Dan; Fleetwood Mac; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire; Frank Zappa; Rush.
Album-oriented rock was difficult not to absorb.</TE>
<TE>   He was curious about Brion -- who had produced Fiona Apple, Aimee
Mann and Rufus Wainwright -- and where he might go next. But Brion
admits he wasn't, at first, so curious about Mehldau.</TE>
<TE>   When Largo's owner-booker, Mark Flanagan, attempted a bit of
matchmaking, Brion was more than skeptical. "I think I literally
groaned!" he recalls. " 'Oh great, this year's Great Young Jazz
Musician.' " But Flanagan slipped him "Art of the Trio, Vol. 2," and
Brion floated down Mehldau's interpretation of "Moon River." "It
comes to a section where the band drops out and a gear gets shifted.
And [Brad's] hand-idea coordination is completely in sync. Here's the
sound I've heard in my head but can't play with my hands! I told
Flanny, 'You just point me in his direction.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, "Largo" isn't a jazz album in a purist's sense. Like a
classic jazz side, it was recorded live with everyone in one room and
without overdubs. But, says Brion, "it's got the scope of an
artsy-fartsy art-pop record, where each song has its own sound. So
it's like, this instrument we're going to mike like they did '50s
jazz instruments and this one, well, we're going to give a really
cockamamie, modern sound."</TE>
<TE>   Brion's mark is embroidered throughout. "Largo" has a feeling of
risk, of lightness, that shouldn't be confused with triteness. It's
pretty basic, Brion says. "I despise what has happened to jazz since
the late '60s with ... all sorts of stupid strictures on it. For me,
jazz is defined by improvisation. Now, if you are always playing the
things basically the same way every time except for the shapes you
play over the chord changes, then you're not awake, you're not aware,
you're not really improvising."</TE>
<TE>   It should, as Monk said, "just happen."</TE>
<TE>   "Originality is a delicate and ethereal thing," says Mehldau. "And
usually no one is going to call it when it happens." You just have to
be open. "I don't know if I would call Jon Brion a jazz musician or
if that really matters. There is something jazz in the spirit of
him." In the sense of the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   "People consider me a wacky, arty rock guy," Brion says. "What
people don't realize is the way that I work is based entirely on
improvisation. And that I'm beholden to improvisation as a life
force. Whether it's a record that people like or not, I can tell you
for a fact that it is human beings improvising head and shoulders
above what passes for jazz. I don't care what people call it. "</TE>
<TE>   Neither does Mehldau.</TE>
<TE>   He'd rather just play it.</TE>

<TE>   A select guide to the pianist's CDs:</TE>
<TE>   "Largo" (Warner Bros., 2002): Mehldau and his "big" band rely on
point of view and serendipity as improvisatory tools.</TE>
<TE>   "Places" (Warner Bros., 2000): An exploration of external and
"internal" place for solo piano and trio.</TE>
<TE>   "Elegiac Cycle" (Warner Bros., 1999): Conceived in Berlin, this
was Mehldau's attempt to "step out of my scene" physically and
intellectually. Reflective and impressionistic, it's solo piano work
that showcases Mehldau's ease and fluency in both jazz and classical
idioms.</TE>
<TE>   "The Art of the Trio, Vol. 3: Songs" (Warner Bros., 1998): A
striking bouquet of standards ("Young at Heart"), originals
("Song-Song") and covers (Radiohead's "Exit Music (For A Film)" that

<HD>Professor Alexander</HD>
<DH>USC's new faculty member teaches actors how to work hard,
not how to get ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than a few of the star-struck USC undergraduates lucky enough to
be admitted to Theatre 397 came to class expecting to be handed the
keys to the entertainment industry.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, Jason Alexander -- in residence this term at USC as the
School of Theatre's first George Burns Visiting Professor -- handed
them a challenge.</LD>
<LD>   "I made it very clear to them the very first day: I don't hold the
keys to the industry; I don't know anybody who does," Alexander said
in a recent conversation before class. "The only thing that will
virtually ensure your success is if you are undeniably good."</LD>
<TE>   Undeniably ... what?</TE>
<TE>   Here they are on the USC campus, achingly eager and impossibly
young, coming from all over the country to study acting just a few
freeway exits from the glittering gated lots of Paramount, Universal
and Warner Bros. They know a little bit about Hollywood -- or think
they do. It's an image pieced together from the media, the movies,
maybe from their friends.</TE>
<TE>   It's all about looks here; it's all about luck. It's a town of
connections; relationships. And what a shame, too, as you were just
saying to your new best friend in the industry, Jason Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   That was the fantasy. But now, here is your new best friend in the
industry, standing before you in the modest classroom, telling you
it's not who you know, but what you know?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe what you've signed up for is not Hollywood Connections 101,
but just what it says on the syllabus: "Practical Technique and
Material Development," four weighty words that imply hard work.
Friday's class is Practical Acting Technique for Singers -- the same
grueling process set to music.</TE>
<TE>   "Time after time, they see 'personalities' spawn into acting
careers or looks spawn into careers," Alexander observes with an
empathetic smile. "There's a huge abundance of very limited talent
doing very well. So it's hard to say to them: 'Work hard, work hard,'
when he ain't workin' hard, and he's making 50 grand a week."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander is not referring to himself. While cracking jokes on
"Seinfeld," this dedicated actor was also attending classes with
acting coach Larry Moss, sometimes far into the night. (That's also
someone else's salary: By the end of "Seinfeld," he and the non-Jerry
cast members were pulling down $600,000 per episode.)</TE>
<TE>   But Alexander knows the question students will eventually ask him.
"I say look, if you are looking for my career, good luck, I can't
tell you how to get it," he says. "I stepped in the right puddle.
Nobody thought 'Seinfeld' would be ... 'Seinfeld.' "</TE>
<TE>   Before a class early in the term, a student rushes up to
Alexander, worried because this student will be absent for an event
planned for later in the year: As a final project of sorts, students
will have the chance to perform before an invited audience of agents,
actors, directors -- Alexander's very good friends in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that I'm just here to get an agent and move on, but ..." the
student begins, interrupting himself with a burst of sheepish
laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, Alexander reassures him. "The people I invite aren't
going to turn around and launch anybody's career."</TE>
<TE>   The student turns and walks away. Hard to tell whether the look on
his face is relief or disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Juggling two jobs</TE>
<TE>   There are two lunch reservations for Alexander on today's list at
the USC Faculty Club. Both are for 12:30 p.m. Alexander raises an
eyebrow. He weighs his options. "I'll take the 12:30," he says
brightly.</TE>
<TE>   It's a scene straight out of "Seinfeld," that comedy about
nothing. But the double commitment seems oddly appropriate. For the
next few months, Alexander will enjoy a dual identity: as a working
actor soon to star as Max Bialystock in the Los Angeles production of
"The Producers," and as USC faculty member.</TE>
<TE>   In an hour or so, Alexander will trek across campus to the
unassuming white building called the Drama Center to hold office
hours before class. Right now, he's fascinated that Faculty Club
lunch tables bear cups of crayons, so brilliant academic minds can
doodle on the paper table covers. "What if e doesn't equal mc2? It
could be discovered right here," Alexander marvels, busily working on
his own crayon sketch of a man's face. After "Seinfeld," Alexander
says, everyone expects him to be as funny as his character, George
Costanza. He says he's not. He is. But Alexander is dead serious
about his new responsibility: teaching college students to become
better actors.</TE>
<TE>   You can, he asserts, teach acting. "For my money, every time
someone walks out the door, they are acting -- they are not, on the
outside, the same way they are on the inside," he says. "We are
always unconsciously defining who we are talking to, and what we want
from them, and what might potentially get in the way.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some people who are scared to death to be in front of
people, or they are scared to death to reveal certain things about
themselves. But take away those impediments, and I think anybody can
learn to act, yes. It's magical when all those things come together
in performance, but the rudiments of it are not magic."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander is an experienced acting coach, but has usually taught
master classes and mostly for struggling working actors, not anxious
18- to 22-year-olds. He's not quite comfortable with that yet.</TE>
<TE>   "They are usually people who have had a great deal of training but
not a ton of success," he says. "What I talk about brings a great
deal of clarity to the process. And then I walk away and wish them
happily ever after. Here, I'm dealing with a younger group of people
who haven't had as much life experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dicey because the bulk of my students are girls," he adds.
"They are choosing pieces where their sexuality comes into play. I
don't even know if they've had sex. I don't even want to assume
they're heterosexual. I'm not quite sure with this age group, in this
setting, what's acceptable, what's proper."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, strolling across campus, Alexander knows what's proper --
he's just having a hard time accepting it. "I could never work on a
college campus full time," he says, a happily married, 43-year-old
family man who can't keep the wistfulness out of his voice as he
watches willowy young women in low-rise jeans on their way to class.</TE>
<TE>   A conflicted teacher</TE>
<TE>   Although he continued to study with noted instructors, including
Lee Strasberg and Moss, Alexander left Boston University after his
junior year because he was being offered acting jobs. "I was
petrified that I was doing the wrong thing," he says. But it worked
-- and left Alexander with mixed feelings about academic degrees in
theater.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved my university experience, it's really valid for a lot of
people, but I personally don't believe it takes four years to teach
the art of acting, of theater," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I had an interesting conversation with a student who came to me
and said, 'I really want to be on "Saturday Night Live" -- is the
stuff you are going to teach me going to make me a better contender
for that?' I said, 'Absolutely not.' Improv has almost nothing to do
with acting technique, it has more to do with a writer's technique.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Why do you want to be at a university?' Because his
parents want him to have a university degree. I said, 'Get a degree
in engineering. If you are going to go through the college
experience, come out with something you can use. But to spend your
time getting a BFA -- nobody's going to ask to see it when you apply
for work.' Gee, the poor guy was totally rattled."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the "poor guy," Adam Ray, a sophomore from
Seattle, was rattled. But also inspired. "He didn't preach to me, or
tell me what to do," Ray says of the conversation with Alexander. "He
just said if it's 'Saturday Night Live' or more comedic stuff I want
to do, get into improv groups, do stand-up."</TE>
<TE>   Ray has decided to stick with the class. Although "practical
acting technique" might not get him on "SNL," it just might get him
somewhere. "I went in there with an open mind and let him work with
me -- I'm there to learn, not to get defensive or intimidated," Ray
says.</TE>
<TE>   Given his nonacademic philosophy, Alexander was amazed and amused
last fall when he received an invitation to apply for the position of
dean of the USC School of Theatre -- a position eventually filled by
former Ahmanson Theatre associate producer Madeline Puzo. The
invitation came about the same time that Alexander's short-lived ABC
series "Bob Patterson" was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   "I sent them back a letter saying thank you for your invitation,
but by your own criteria, I would be a horrible dean," Alexander
says. "I really don't have the academic background, I don't have the
fund-raising background. I've done master classes but never at USC,
if that's of interest to you."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Scales, then the dean of the theater school, invited
Alexander to become the George Burns professor. Burns left $1 million
each to the theater programs at USC and UCLA. USC had decided to put
the funds in an endowment to cover the cost of bringing theater
professionals in to teach. The idea was to create short-term
opportunities for professionals whose schedules don't allow them to
assume long-term academic posts. The drama school is still trying to
establish a regular schedule for the fledgling program; there is no
George Burns professor coming in for the spring term.</TE>
<TE>   Puzo, the new dean, said admission to Alexander's course was
first-come, first-served, although the musical theater class required
a singing audition. Each visiting professorship will be designed
around the skills and interests of the invitee, she said, adding that
future visiting professors may be distinguished in the field of
theater, but not household names like Alexander. Although Alexander's
celebrity may be a motivating factor for students, she said, "once
the work begins, it's not about spending time with a star."</TE>
<TE>   In tribute to Burns, the school wanted the first visiting
professor to come from the world of comedy. They asked Lily Tomlin;
she wasn't available because she was taking her one-woman show "Signs
of Intelligent Life in the Universe" to Broadway and on tour,
including a run at the Ahmanson Theatre. But Alexander had a window
of time before beginning rehearsals for "The Producers," opening at
the Pantages in May.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander visited the drama school several times during the
previous academic year. He recalls how his silent presence in the
back of a class on sitcom technique discombobulated the instructor.</TE>
<TE>   Tears of joy</TE>
<TE>   Practical Acting Technique for Singers causes floods of tears
Fridays from 2 to 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed around the midterm, freshman Brandi Wolff from Golden,
Colo., observes that of eight students who had the chance to work in
front of Alexander, seven have cried.</TE>
<TE>   That includes Aaron Neely, who tried to make a joke out of wiping
his eyes after a few tips from Alexander transformed his chosen song
-- "Lost in the Wilderness" from the Stephen Schwartz musical
"Children of Eden" -- from a good imitation of the cast album into a
plea, quivering with complex emotions. The girls were only too happy
to offer sympathy and Kleenex. When guys cry, it's cool.</TE>
<TE>   "How much better is this? How important is it that we work this
hard?" Alexander asks calmly, no more successful at hiding his pride
than Neely was at hiding his tears. "You can own us, when you are
this committed."</TE>
<TE>   Wolff cried too. The coltish brunet, who started singing at age 4
while Grandma played piano, may not have accomplished the full
transformation into the downtrodden prostitute she needed to be for
her song, "Someone Like You" from "Jekyll &amp; Hyde," but came closer
than she'd ever been before.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason is teaching in a very honest way, and I think the students
see it as an opportunity to really express themselves, instead of
just to put on a show and get praised," she says later. "Most people,
I think are just so inspired, and so touched, that we start crying."</TE>
<TE>   Alexander says acting can be taught -- but not everyone can learn.
When do you tell a young actor there's no chance at all?</TE>
<TE>   "I would never do that," Alexander says quickly. "When I was
studying with Larry Moss, I would be watching certain people in the
class, and I'd be thinking: 'Let it go, tell them, they're no good.</TE>
<TE>   "But he'd say: 'Wait, wait.' Sometimes it would take a year, or
two or three -- and then they'd come in with a breakthrough. "The
question they always ask is, should I be looking for an agent now?
Should I be going out on auditions now? And I say: 'I can't answer
that question.' I just say that any professional door you walk
through, this is your shot. You'll have it once. Are you ready to
take a shot, in your assessment? If they say yes, I say, 'Then go
take the shot.' "</TE>
<TE>   Alexander can't give them the keys to the industry -- only tools.
And, he hopes, the understanding that being success does not
necessarily mean a role on the next "Seinfeld."</TE>
<TE>   "I have friends from college who work in small repertory
companies, who make a small salary but do leading roles in some of
the great stage productions," Alexander says. "Are they failures
because they are in Podunk, Ind.? I think to my class, they are
failures, but time may change that opinion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next up for Alexander</TE>
<TE>   Between USC and "Producers" rehearsals starting March 13, Jason
Alexander will be a producer -- of an independent comedy movie in
which he will also star. "An Extra Marriage" is a co-production of
Alexander's AngelArk Entertainment (with partners Jennifer
Birchfield-Eik and Michael Jackman) and Jon Aaron Productions, with a
script by Mitch Markowitz ("Good Morning, Vietnam"). It will be shot
in Los Angeles in January and February. Alexander will play a man who
risks his happy marriage for one night with his fantasy woman.</TE>

<HD>They're thinking inside the box</HD>
<DH>At the Skirball, a freight elevator (maximum capacity: 50)
becomes a platform for two performers who delight in making the most
of its angles and acoustics.</DH>

<LD>"The way the doors open looks like the beginning of 'Get Smart'!
There's a grate that goes up and doors that slam horizontally! The
acoustics are great too. When you step onto it, it vibrates and kind
of echoes."</LD>
<LD>   Shel Wagner Rasch is one happy dancer as she talks about her
current collaborator, the freight elevator at the Skirball Cultural
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Along with her partner, Stefan Fabry, Rasch chose this particular
bit of architecture, an 11-by-18-by-15-foot kinetic box big enough to
hold 50 people (or 10,000 pounds), as the starting point for
"Skirball Improvisation 3," an entry in the cultural center's new
site-specific dance series.</LD>
<TE>   The gunmetal-gray lift -- made by Fujitec, lighted by fluorescent
bulbs, framed in stainless steel -- is usually used to move
everything from stepladders to ancient Israeli artifacts between the
center's three floors. Today at 2 p.m., it will contain Rasch and
Fabry and their "contact improvisation" choreography -- they tend to
hurl themselves and each other off walls, the floor, whatever. The
elevator's corners, says Rasch, make for lots of interesting angles.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the sound. This part of the piece (it will also
move outdoors) will be accompanied only by stand-up bass (Tom Peters,
stationed inside) and ambient elevator vibes.</TE>
<TE>   The performance begins as the elevator descends from the top floor
to the basement, where audience members wait. They'll "hear it coming
down and opening up and they'll also hear it close and go away at the
end," Rasch says. "Every step we take makes the whole room shake. The
elevator is a cool frame for a dance."</TE>

<LD>   Vivian Nixon, 18, is taking a break from her freshman year at New

the dance-driven, modernized version of "Snow White" premiered in
Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   "When I went to the school a couple of times, I had to hide,
because she does not want people to know," Allen says. "She wants to
be on her own. I watched a dance class and I had a hat on, and she
walked right by me and said, 'Thanks, Mom, just blow my cover,' " she
adds with a burst of laughter. "I respect it."</LD>
<TE>   Nixon, who is studying with the Alvin Ailey American Dance

<HD>If Santana repeats, who gets Grammy?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The release of Santana's new "Shaman" album raises the possibility of
a rerun of the 2000 Grammy Awards, with Clive Davis again accepting
the album of the year trophy, as he did as co-producer of Santana's
"Supernatural."</LD>
<LD>   With that prospect, some issues raised last time are coming up
anew.</LD>
<LD>   The concern is that the storied record executive, who is listed as
co-producer with Carlos Santana on both albums, is not credited on
either collection as the official producer on any of the individual
tracks. Some in the industry feel that makes him more of an executive
producer.</LD>
<TE>   That difference seems trivial, save for one thing: Producers
receive an album of the year Grammy, executive producers don't.</TE>
<TE>   No one disputes Davis' integral importance to the Santana albums.
Santana himself routinely says Davis was involved in every facet,
from song selection to assembling the collaborations that mark the
collections.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pure executive producing," says veteran musician, producer
and record company executive Bobby Colomby, when asked to assess
Davis' role. "A record producer is like a film director -- that's the
analogy. A producer in film is the guy who gets the money and puts
the team together. In music, that's the executive producer."</TE>
<TE>   In the film world, criteria for such credits are governed by the
guilds' rules.</TE>
<TE>   In music, there are no such procedures, and the Grammy-sponsoring
National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences has no official rules
as to what constitutes producing for the purpose of award
eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We rely on the accuracy of the record companies for the credits
on their albums," says Diane Theriot, the academy's senior vice
president of awards. "When you get 15,000 entries every year, we
can't really get in the middle of that. I can't go into the studio to
verify everything. We have to rely on the labels."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of both Davis and Santana stressed the integral
role Davis had in the making of the music, but had no other comments
on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis credit is not the only one that has spurred some
industry debate. Similar concerns came up earlier this year when the
Grammy for country album went to Lost Highway Records President Luke
Lewis and collaborators Mary Martin and Bonnie Garner, who were
credited as compilation producers for the Hank Williams tribute
"Timeless," although the actual songs were produced by others.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Lanois, who as a producer won best album Grammys in 1987
for U2's "The Joshua Tree" and in 1997 for Bob Dylan's "Time Out of
Mind," is concerned that Davis' credit obscures the efforts of the
actual producers involved in the albums, but does not begrudge him
the recognition.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many records made that way," says Lanois, who has
six Grammys as a producer. "I wish [Davis] all the best and if he
feels he deserves the credit and the award, then let him go up there.
I know what hard work it is to mastermind something and have it
succeed."</TE>
<TE>   If Davis does get the Grammy again, it won't have quite the same
intrigue as in 2000, when he'd just been squeezed out of the
chairmanship of Arista Records, the company he'd founded and that
released "Supernatural."</TE>
<TE>   However, Santana's still on Arista, so Davis, who now heads J
Records, would be on the podium, while his Arista successor, "Shaman"
executive producer Antonio "L.A." Reid, would be sitting in the
audience.</TE>
<TE>   He's the Samuel Pepys of rock</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Lanois handled the lead vocals on his solo albums, 1989's
"Acadie" and 1993's "For the Beauty of Wynona."</TE>
<TE>   But he's willing to share some of those duties on the album he's
finishing now. No wonder -- Bono is his duet partner on one song.</TE>
<TE>   The U2 singer and Lanois recently co-wrote a song titled "Falling
at Your Feet," with plans to put it on Lanois' as-yet-untitled album.
It probably will come out in March from Epitaph Records' Anti label,
home to Tom Waits, Merle Haggard and now Nick Cave.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lanois just hosted a delegation from the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, which has plans for a modest exhibition drawn from the
detailed journals he kept while producing albums by Bob Dylan, U2,
Peter Gabriel, Emmylou Harris and others.</TE>
<TE>   "I have lots of notes and journals," he says, "things I wrote
while working on those albums, sitting up at night wondering if maybe
I could just get Peter to sing a certain way it might take a song a
whole new direction. Lots of things like that. I'm flattered they
asked."</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   After a break working with such side projects as Boxcar Racer and
Transplants, the three members of Blink-182 will reconvene in January
to start work on a new album. No producer has been selected, and no
release date has been set.</TE>
<TE>   With brother Chris Robinson having launched his solo career,
former Black Crowes guitarist-songwriter Rich Robinson is starting a
new band, Hookah Brown. John Hogg, from the English band Moke, has
signed on as lead singer, with American drummer Bill Dobrow and
English bassist Fionn O'Lochlainn filling out the quartet. The band
will be introduced with a "surprise" show in New York this week.</TE>
<TE>   Blues veteran John Hammond follows last year's "Wicked Grin"
album, which was produced by Tom Waits and consisted entirely of
Waits songs, with "Ready for Love," produced by Los Lobos' David
Hidalgo. The album is due Feb. 11 from Back Porch Records and will
feature "Crown Vic," the first song Hammond has written in his
40-year career. There will also be tunes by Waits, the Rolling
Stones, George Jones, Billie Holiday and Muddy Waters, and two new
ones by Hidalgo.</TE>
<TE>   Electronica duo Deep Dish has been tapped for the 25th edition of
the Global Underground DJ CDs drawn from live spinning sessions.
Members Ali "Dubfire" Shirazinia and Sharam Tayebi will work
separately for the first time, each creating one disc of the
double-CD set. Their sets will be done in Canada this month --
Tayebi's in Montreal, Shirazinia's in Vancouver.Each also will
produce an expanded, limited-edition double-disc set of his own. All
three albums are due in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Weller's album "Illumination," which debuted at No. 1 when
released in the U.K. earlier this year, will get its U.S. release
Jan. 14 in an expanded version from independent Yep Rock Records. The
package will feature a bonus DVD with five videos and live material
shot in a concert in London's Hyde Park.</TE>

<LD>   "Audioslave" (Epic)</LD>
<LD>   *** 1/2</LD>
<TE>   For anyone coming to this Chris Cornell/Rage Against the Machine
super-pairing (due in stores Tuesday) as a Rage fan, the music is
likely to be jarring -- especially for those who favored Rage more
for the political fury of singer Zack de la Rocha than for the three
instrumentalists' sonic assault.</TE>
<TE>   With Rage guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and
drummer Brad Wilk, former Soundgarden frontman Cornell doesn't try to
adopt De la Rocha's focus on rapping and social commentary. He
continues to write passionately about overcoming deeply rooted
insecurities and doubts.</TE>
<TE>   For those turning to Audioslave as fans of Cornell or of Rage's
musical prowess, however, the impact of this new unit should be
immediate and deep.</TE>
<TE>   With grunge favorites Soundgarden, Cornell was one of the most
thrilling singers in rock, someone who could match the abandon and
wail of Led Zeppelin and then touch us with softer and more personal
moments. Although Cornell made some memorable music with Soundgarden,
there were times when he seemed to be reaching for emotions beyond
that band's interest or scope.</TE>
<TE>   His new partners seem eager to explore wider musical dimensions
with him, which is good because the relentless, fist-in-your-face
assault of Rage's old rap-rock approach needed to be expanded. From
the inner confusion of "Show Me How to Live" to the restless
aggression of "Gasoline," the result is both fresh and liberating.</TE>
<TE>   -- Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   Braxton spreads herself too thin</TE>
<TE>   Toni Braxton</TE>
<TE>   "More Than a Woman" (Arista)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   "You're more than a woman to me," sang the Bee Gees in a 1977 song
from "Saturday Night Fever." Braxton doesn't reprise that classic
disco moment here, but the R&amp;B-pop diva's fifth album (in stores
Tuesday) is all about settling for nothing less than a man with that
same attitude.</TE>
<TE>   With up-to-the-minute production by such brand names as the
Neptunes and Rodney Jerkins, this collection feels like a more
genteel, synthed-out cousin to recent works by Missy Elliott and TLC.
Such numbers as the I've-had-enough "Let Me Show You the Way (Out)"
have that danceable, hypnotic funkiness, while the soulful "Lies,
Lies, Lies" puts some rock into the mix. Yet the propulsive "Hit the
Freeway" and the lush ballad "Rock Me, Roll Me" evoke English
avant-garde songstress Kate Bush with layered vocals, strings and
burbling electronic noises.</TE>
<TE>   'Round about the Spanish-guitar-flavored, Madonna-esque "Me &amp; My
Boyfriend," however, the collection starts to feel as if it's more
about covering all the pop bases. Which is OK, but Braxton's
tough-to-tender messages aren't much different from those of a lot of
current take-charge female pop singers. And putting her capable voice
into so many different musical settings doesn't completely disguise a
lack of real insight.</TE>

pop may have been written mostly on a trip to Brazil and ooze French
and English accents, but its essence is vintage California pop in the
sunshine-can't-cure-me tradition of the Beach Boys, Burt Bacharach,
Nilsson, even the Mamas &amp; the Papas.</TE>
<TE>   How such grand, embraceable vocal harmonies have flown so long
under the radar is a bit of a mystery, but "Morning Macumba" is
Bikeride's fourth album, and once again former Loyola Marymount
student Tony Carbone delivers a handful of perfect surprises. "Fakin'
Amnesia" is a driving, guitar-and-piano clap-tracker in the spirit of
Apples in Stereo. On "Moonracing," Carbone lets his chalky,
endearing, sometimes Wreckless Eric delivery drop down to an Elliott
Smith hush and milks some lo-fi instrumentation.</TE>
<TE>   But "Norwegia" is the reason to keep this album on constant
repeat, a softly psychedelic jangle rocker with a soaring,
harmony-drenched chorus of "la la las" that connect with the
universe. If you don't catch yourself whistling this one later, you
better check your pulse.</TE>

<TE>   Sean Paul</TE>
<TE>   "Dutty Rock" (Atlantic)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   The mainstreaming of dancehall continues with this Jamaica-born
international hit maker, whose sophomore album strengthens the bonds
between hip-hop and the fast-paced reggae style that helped spawn rap
in the late '70s. With such star guests as Jay-Z, Busta Rhymes and
the Neptunes, and tracks addressing the crowd-pleasing subjects of
sex, parties, sex, ganja and sex, "Dutty" (as in "dirty") should seal
the Super Cat devotee's appeal among U.S. listeners.</TE>
<TE>   This very long collection also suffers from weaknesses that plague
the albums of artists in both genres. Among the 22
dance-floor-oriented tracks are such engaging numbers as the pulsing
hit "Gimme the Light," the shake-it-baby roll of "Get Busy," and the
breezy, old-school-feeling "Still in Love." But after 75 minutes,
Paul's braggadocio and so-so toasting become less fetching and the
songs become monotonous, despite efforts to vary things by mixing in
techno and funk.</TE>
<TE>   The production at times is a saving grace, adding a particularly
appealing bit of clacking percussion or some squiggly ray-gun buzzes
and bleeps. But the handful of silly between-song skits is soooo
cliched. Oh well. At least Paul was smart enough to include the much
better Rhymes remix of "Gimme the Light."</TE>

<TE>   Saint Etienne</TE>
<TE>   "Finisterre" (Beggars Banquet)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the ethereal beauty of 2000's stunning "Sound of
Water," the latest effort by this British trio sounds unusually
carefree, even sloppy. Those willing to forgive the pedantic spoken
interludes and an unfortunate foray into rap will be rewarded with
Etienne's sunny pop hooks and luscious, organic electronica. A big
plus: Sarah Cracknell's languid vocals have never sounded this
soulful. The group headlines the Palace on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ernesto Lechner</TE>
<TE>   Dot Allison</TE>
<TE>   "We Are Science" (Mantra Recordings)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   Scotland's Allison (who opens Monday's Saint Etienne concert at
the Palace) is a traditional singer-songwriter who delivers her
sensitive love songs with an empathetic voice. However, she
accompanies her tales with the best elements of dance music --
playfulness, musical experimentation and inviting rhythms. The result
on her second solo album sets a 21st century standard for the torch
song, soulful yet musically fresh.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   Keith Urban</TE>
<TE>   "Golden Road" (Capitol Nashville)</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Urban is one chipper cowboy. The Australian's second album brims
with tuneful good feelings, implying life's struggles far more than
outright exploring them. He lives a little, loves a little, hurts a
little and smiles a whole bunch in songs crafted in a conversational
style that lacks the sharp focus of country sophomore classmate Brad
Paisley.</TE>
<TE>   -- Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   Susan Tedeschi</TE>
<TE>   "Wait for Me" (Artemis)</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   The Boston guitar-slinger and singer still hasn't stepped out of
Bonnie Raitt's shadow five years after her second album turned into a
surprise hit. What Tedeschi lacks in originality she makes up for
with skills in rootsy styles from front-porch acoustic blues to
horn-drenched soul to roaring roadhouse rock.</TE>

<HD>The Russia we don't get to see</HD>
<DH>The classical ballets are exported, but Moscow audiences
are treated to charged work in a thriving contemporary dance scene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Moscow</DL>
<LD>The first notes of a recorded rock score by Peter Gabriel generate
happy squeals throughout the theater as the curtain rises on Dmitry
Bryantsev's "Salome." One of two steamy Bible stories being performed
tonight by his company, the 75-member Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet, the
dance drama represents a display of both the company's classical
training and its contemporary sensibility.</LD>
<LD>   Replete with simulated nudity, the costumes by Vladimir Arefyev
mediate between the fashion extremes of ancient, upper-class Judea
and millennial, urban Russia. In the same way, Bryantsev's
choreography fuses a narrative about the murder of John the Baptist
with the flash, danger and compulsive hedonism of contemporary
late-night Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   An English weekly here rates the city's bars and nightclubs on the
basis of money (how many rubles you need to spend per hour), threat
(the likelihood of being attacked by flatheads, the new breed of
Russian thug) and sex (the chances of scoring) -- and "Salome" drips
with all three. Focused on a power- and sex-mad family, it culminates
in an eerie trio showing Salome and her mommy dearest, Herodias,
gloating over the Baptist's severed head while a lustful, drugged-out
King Herod reels away in disgust.</LD>
<TE>   Created in 1998, "Salome" was not included in the Moscow
Stanislavsky Ballet's repertory at the Kodak Theatre this summer.
Instead, there were multiple performances of the full-evening "Swan
Lake," "Don Quixote" and just a single night of mixed repertory with
only one piece by a living choreographer (Bryantsev's "Spirit Ball").
Reports suggest that the company's return engagement next spring also
will be dominated by familiar classics, and that pattern holds for
virtually every Russian company that visits Southern California. The
big exception: St. Petersburg-based Boris Eifman, with his intense
historical dance-dramas.</TE>
<TE>   So what we see on our stages creates the illusion that Russian
dance audiences spend all their time at hoary tutu ballets. And that
means the reality of Russia's exciting, multifaceted contemporary
dance goes virtually unrecognized.</TE>
<TE>   Not tied to the classics</TE>
<TE>   Besides being a new Sodom, Moscow offers a dazzling performing
arts scene. In one recent week, you could have chosen from two
adaptations of Victor Hugo's "Notre Dame de Paris" (one a musical,
the other a ballet), two stagings of Rostand's "Cyrano de Bergerac"
(one traditional, the other a brilliant modern-dress production),
performances at two Moscow Art Theatres (one a monument to Chekhov,
the other Gorky), a world-class "Turandot" at the Bolshoi, and "Lord
of the Dance" at the Kremlin. Meanwhile, satirical revues undermine
official views of the world and contemporary work of all kinds
relishes the freedoms of the post-Communist era.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of this activity, Bryantsev runs a ballet company
that tries to cover all bases. Each month, his company dances about
12 performances, sharing the Moscow Stanislavsky Music Theatre with a
resident opera. Five ballets are usually classical, five contemporary
and two aimed at children. A new theater complex will open in 2005,
he says, and a planned second stage will allow ballet performances to
take place on nights that now belong to the opera. He's even planning
a second company to dance small-scale and riskier new works in
another Moscow venue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to being part of the 21st century, doing
different things," Bryantsev says, and his varied body of work
supports that statement. In addition to "Salome" and its equally
macabre companion piece, "Shulamite" (about the doubly fatal adultery
of King Solomon), his work ranges from the nostalgic, dreamlike
"Spirit Ball" to a two-act "Taming of the Shrew" full of sunny,
Mediterranean humor, and a completely re-choreographed, neoclassical
"Le Corsaire" that just may be the most dramatically astute version
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   He's also known for a series of experimental short pieces that
Russians call "miniatures," some of them extremely daring
thematically. In 1987, for example, he choreographed "The Road," a
duet for dancers portraying Christ and the woman taken in adultery --
but it was kept off the stage for two years by government authorities
until the downfall of Communist restrictions (and, soon after,
communism itself) freed it.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran company member Dmitry Erlykin, who dances such character
roles as Herod in "Salome," says that "when Bryantsev came to the
company in 1985, it became something new, combining what we already
had -- 'Esmeralda,' 'Snow Maiden,' 'Swan Lake' -- with innovative
choreography from the modern point of view." And that combination has
become the company's chief distinction.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not feel anything bad about the classics," Bryantsev says.
"It is our heritage. But I try not to be tied only to classical
style. Whatever story or character or image I want to create, I do
it. I use anything. Our movements must be as free as our emotions."</TE>
<TE>   Foreign companies' influence</TE>
<TE>   BRYANTSEV'S experiments are only a small piece of the Russian
picture. "There's a powerful movement toward contemporary dance now,"
says Sergei Korobkov, artistic director of Nations State Theatre in
Moscow, which organizes dance festivals throughout the country. "Even
in small towns, people are no longer living in ballet fairy tales."</TE>
<TE>   The entrenched repertories of official, state-supported theaters
often result in seasons that are 70% classical and only 30%
contemporary, Korobkov says, "but when you look at the number of
premieres, it's vice versa: 70% contemporary and only 30% classical."</TE>
<TE>   Like a number of Moscow critics and dancers, Korobkov resents the
fact that Eifman is the only contemporary Russian choreographer who
is recognized in Europe and America at a time, he says, when "there
are 10 to 15 very good contemporary dance companies in Moscow,
Petersburg, the Urals and the far east" of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   To Moscow dance critic and editor Anna Galaida, this new
"explosion of contemporary dance in Russia" can be credited to the
influence of foreign companies appearing in a series of festivals,
beginning in the early '90s. "They educated and nurtured the
audience," she explains. She also draws a distinction between modern
dance and modern ballet, believing there is more serious interest in
Moscow in the former right now than in the latter.</TE>
<TE>   By consensus, Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet -- the best known dance
institution in all of Russia -- plays no important role on the
contemporary dance scene. Blame artistic conservatism, limited dancer
versatility and recent managerial upheavals, plus ticket prices that
are sometimes so high, critic Alexander Firer says, "that only
tourists and flatheads can afford to go."</TE>
<TE>   The dancers make news</TE>
<TE>   At the Young Peoples' Theatre, across the street from the Bolshoi,
a chamber ensemble misnamed Ballet Moscow is performing a two-part
program confirming that Russian modern dancers are no less impressive
than their classical counterparts. There are no traces of ballet in
Paul Selvin Norton's "The Rogue Tool," which plays with cyclical
structure, discontinuity, tricks of scale and ironic new vaudeville
moves, while Natalia Ficksel's more conventionally focused "Don Juan
Rehabilitated" uses contrasting duets to explore current gender
attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   Merce Cunningham technique, Pina Bausch dramatic strategies,
Pilobolus gymnastics and a tradition of sophisticated Moscow
stagecraft loom large here, but the dancers themselves are the big
news: so accomplished and committed that they make even hand-me-down
ideas compelling.</TE>
<TE>   The choreography tonight may not merit international exposure, but
when the next big thing comes along, they'll be as ready to dance it
as any company anywhere. And, who knows? The next big thing could be
taking shape in their minds even now.</TE>
<TE>   As many of the dancers, critics and administrators repeatedly
mention in interviews, Russians such as Sergei Diaghilev, Mikhail
Fokine and Vaslav Nijinsky changed ballet forever early in the 20th
century. Afterward, only the imposition of an oppressive political
system kept dance in Russia from following the modernist trends
prevalent in Europe and America -- or developing home-grown
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "We were considered to be in the forward ranks of world dance and
suddenly we found ourselves locked in one style," Moscow Stanislavsky
dancer Erlykin says. "We have lagged behind and we're trying to catch
up. And now we're making huge leaps, even if those leaps do not
always take us where we want."</TE>

<LD>Frederic Rzewski</LD>
<LD>   "Rzewski Plays Rzewksi: Piano Works. 1975-1999" (Nonesuch)</LD>
<LD>   ****</LD>
<TE>   Frederic Rzewski is a left-wing Liszt. Given America's political
mood these days, and given that the Liszt revival has pretty much
petered out, this may not seem like the best moment for Nonesuch
Records to release a landmark seven-CD set of Rzewski playing his
piano music.</TE>
<TE>   But try listening to a few minutes of Rzewski (pronounced
ZHEV-ski) performing his addictive "The People United Will Never Be
Defeated" and see if you can stop the CD player any more easily than
you can put down that bag of chips. A beguiling Chilean political
song immediately insinuates itself into your consciousness, while
Rzewski develops a series of variations so astonishingly original in
sound and idea, that you can't imagine what he will do next. In the
course of an hour, he just keeps topping himself.</TE>
<TE>   A 64-year-old, Harvard-trained American composer and pianist,
Rzewski has made his life and career in Europe for most of the last
40 years. He has always been an ardent outsider, associated with
radical political and musical movements. He has taken to making
pronouncements about how he sees the symphony orchestra as an
outdated feudal institution that still treats musicians as servants.
But his outsider status only goes so far. He has a respectable
academic teaching gig in Belgium. And it would be hard to find a
composer today who employs a more extensive working knowledge of
Western tradition for his own music, to say nothing of a classical
composer who is a more thrilling pianist or improviser.</TE>
<TE>   Rzewski is often called eclectic, and he is to the extent that his
music presents a dazzling array of styles and techniques that range
from the Middle Ages to the present. But miraculously, Rzewski
actually makes the issue of style irrelevant. Everything sounds as
though it is a manifestation of the same impulse. "I think it now has
to be agreed," composer Christian Wolff writes in his illuminating
Nonesuch notes, "that Rzewski's music simply sounds like no other."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds like no other music because it is made like no other
music. Rzewski has found a way to be recklessly free and rigorously
controlled, to be fervent populist and master of the arcane, at the
same time. In "People United," Lisztian bravura collides with easy
jazz, with clusters of notes hammered out so hard you practically
expect the keys to fly off the piano, with whistling, singing,
elegant sustained chords, and so on. But this is also the work of a
mathematical obsessive who elaborately structures sets and subsets
that build a cascading momentum and create a new kind of musical
unity.</TE>
<TE>   This ability to contain opposing forces in a single musical
gesture is the hallmark of Rzewski's career. He first came to
attention in the early 1960s when he helped form the free
improvisation group Musica Elettronica Viva in Rome. He later toured
as a pianist with Karlheinz Stockhausen, but was also a close friend
of and musical co-conspirator with British radical and Maoist
Cornelius Cardew, who once wrote a book titled "Stockhausen Serves
Imperialism." "People United," written for Ursula Oppens in 1975 and
the earliest work on the Nonesuch set, may take its inspiration from
the Latin American Marxism of its time, but the musical message is
more abstract and so compellingly makes the case for a kind of
stylistic liberty that I have seen it win over political as well as
musical conservatives with ease.</TE>
<TE>   Rzewski's expansive protean abilities are demonstrated over and
over on the remaining six discs. In "North American Ballads" from
1979, he once more takes insinuating melodies and explodes them into
vast, fantastical musical landscapes, one style effortlessly
following another, sometimes with sonorities so massive that the
piano can barely contain them. An epic Sonata from 1991 knocks
together fragments of "Ring Around the Rosy," "Santa Claus Is Coming
to Town," the medieval plainchant "L'Homme Arme," "Johnny I Hardly
Knew Ye," John Lennon's "Give Peace a Chance" and "Three Blind Mice"
in a kaleidoscopic first movement. The second movement is a long set
of variations on "Taps." The final Agitato shoots through 27
variations on the plainchant tune.</TE>
<TE>   A theatrical composer</TE>
<TE>   Rzewski is, in all he writes, a grippingly dramatic composer, and
at times an audaciously theatrical one as well. "De Profundis," the
composer writes, "demands a combination of virtuoso technique and a
total lack of inhibition on stage, thus virtually guaranteeing that
no mediocre or conventional performer will dare to go near it."</TE>
<TE>   Composed in 1991, it requires the pianist to simultaneously play
and recite a deeply moving Oscar Wilde letter. In addition, the
pianist's entire body is brought into percussive play as it evokes
Wilde's desperation in Reading Gaol, and his transcendence of pain
and humiliation. It's true: No other piano music sounds like this.</TE>
<TE>   Two discs are devoted to the first four parts of "The Road," a
work in progress. Divided into "miles" -- short pieces meant to work
like chapters -- the full score when completed next year will last
around eight hours. It is a musical journey across time and space and
thought. There are fractured marches and the sounds of train
whistles, as Rzewski plays and sings and even reads in Russian from
Gogol's "The Nose." Already "The Road" is a vast musical panorama.</TE>
<TE>   As a pianist, Rzewski has slowed down over the years. He's added
more than 10 minutes to the Piano Sonata, turning it into a 45-minute
extravaganza. That's a bit too long, but for the most part, his
playing retains its captivating bravura and freshness, and only gets
deeper. Improvisations are inserted into some pieces, and they are
stunning.</TE>
<TE>   These recordings, made in Brussels between 1998 and 2001, are of
audiophile immediacy. And true to Rzewski's everyman philosophy,
Nonesuch has priced the seven CDs at a discount (a street price of
around $50). A great figure in American music is beginning to get his
proper due.</TE>

<HD>Bringing City Hall Closer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A week after city voters rejected a drastic proposal to break Los
Angeles apart, Mayor James K. Hahn unveiled a plan to make the city
more responsive to the complaints behind the breakup effort. Laid out
before secession leaders had time to regroup, the plan is not just
good politics; it has the potential to be good government.</LD>
<LD>   By moving so quickly, Hahn rightly acknowledges that the "no" vote
on San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession was not a victory for
the status quo. Instead, it was a call to continue building on
reforms that voters said yes to three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The revamped City Charter, approved in 1999, created seven
regional planning commissions and dozens of advisory neighborhood
councils, 56 of which have organized so far. Hahn's 10-point
"TeamWork LA" capitalizes on this and aims to bring government closer
to the people. Literally. It establishes "neighborhood city halls" in
each of the seven local planning districts -- the North Valley, the
South Valley, the Eastside, the Westside, Central L.A., South L.A.
and the harbor area.</LD>
<TE>   Borrowing from the Los Angeles Police Department's popular senior
lead officers program, each city hall will have a director
accountable for the quality of services in that area and
"neighborhood specialists" to help residents learn how to use the new
system. A "neighborhood cabinet" made up of city workers from
departments such as public works, parks and transportation will staff
the city halls. Expanded hours and computer tracking of services
modeled on a program being set up in the LAPD to track crime complete
the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Its advantage over either a breakup or a dramatic restructuring of
Los Angeles into semi-independent boroughs is that the city can start
on this new model right away, due to charter reforms that gave the
mayor the power to make administrative changes without going through
the City Council. (City Council members Tom LaBonge, Ruth Galanter,
Wendy Greuel and Janice Hahn contributed to the plan, and LaBonge is
working to organize regional City Council committees to work with
each of the city halls.)</TE>
<TE>   Five of the seven regional planning districts, now doubling as
city service districts, already have municipal buildings. Hahn claims
that staffing them is just a matter of reassigning downtown workers,
not hiring new ones. The test, of course, will lie in whether this
plan works, and that will take a long-term commitment to thoughtful
reform. It is at the very least a welcome first step.</TE>

<KH>HELPING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS</KH>
<HD>Bush Should Lead the Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a round-table discussion last April, in a conference center set
amid the native pines of the New Mexican desert, President Bush
talked with Ohio mental health director Michael Hogan just before
naming him to head the nation's first mental health commission in 25
years. "You know, you and I both grew up in the Southwest," Bush
said, "where the ethic is, 'You have personal problems? Suck it up.'
" Bush related how his attitude changed when he saw antidepressants
give a suicidally depressed friend a new lease on life. And that, he
said, was part of his decision to create his New Freedom Commission
on Mental Health.</LD>
<LD>   Bush that day accurately described the current mental health
system as one that lets "many Americans fall through the cracks ...
[failing to] confront the hidden suffering of Americans with mental
illness ... on the streets ... in our jails, our prisons, our
juvenile detention facilities." He asked for a system that "treats
mental illness with the same urgency as physical illness."</LD>
<LD>   Hogan's commission got as far as agreeing with the president about
how bad the problem is. "America's mental health service delivery
system is in shambles," its report said this month. However, repairs
are simply off the Washington radar. That's why Bush should spend
some of his formidable political capital right away to get beyond
hand-wringing to practical solutions. He should:</LD>
<TE>   * Require programs including federal disability, Medicare and
Medicaid to focus their spending on what works. The current shambles
partly results from the fact that none of these big programs is
really focused on mental health -- it's just a sideline to them. And,
as Hogan said in an interview with The Times last week, "The current
system spends tens of billions of dollars each year 'helping' people
once they've hit rock bottom but little on programs with a proven
record of helping people get back on their feet."</TE>
<TE>   Hogan cited one model, the Village, which he visited last week in
Long Beach. At the Village, professional staff and former "members"
help the mentally ill and addicted kick their drug habits, get proper
medication and find a place to live and work.</TE>
<TE>   * Back a bill that the late Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.)
co-authored with Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.) to outlaw disparities
in coverage between mental and physical illness. The House passed a
much weaker bill last week, but Bush should push the new Congress for
something better early next year. The Wellstone-Domenici bill in its
current form covers too many afflictions, not all of which pass a
common-sense test as serious ailments. So the White House should work
now with Domenici's staff to restrict the measure to serious mental
illnesses like schizophrenia and autism.</TE>
<TE>   As anyone in that New Mexico audience would attest, Bush can talk
the talk. By backing a strong parity bill and from-the-top reforms in
the way federal agencies help the seriously mentally ill, he could
walk the walk.</TE>

<LD>Oh, good, another unexpected wrinkle from scientific observations of
our society's most fundamental optional relationship: marriage. Some
German scientists -- weren't they the ones who gifted us with the
rocket? -- have figured out that spouses being solicitous of a
partner in chronic pain actually increase the suffering. By
expressing concern and talking about the problem, the "helper" can
triple the pain. They have the proof right there in little electric
brain squiggles.</LD>
<LD>   Now, we're all for openness and more knowledge; humanity's
perpetual march toward greater wisdom and all, "Jackass: the Movie"
notwithstanding. And it's no shock to those who've been married at
least once that pain can be associated with marital bliss.</LD>
<LD>   But, frankly, this counterintuitive research on pain is itself a
large pain. Think about it. If you're in a, shall we say, less than
loving marital partnership, this research suggests an ideal way for
one partner to wreak satisfying revenge on the other: Just act kind
and concerned. "You poor thing! This is awful!" The kinder and more
prolonged the concern, the greater the suffering. It's perfect.
You'll appear saintly while the target of concern writhes in mounting
agony.</LD>
<TE>   What they did at Heidelberg University was detect heightened
activity in the anterior cingulate vortex, the pain processor, when a
spouse was solicitous about a partner's pain. Just the spouse's
presence could amplify anguish.</TE>
<TE>   These findings are also a caution for those in abiding
relationships. It's bad enough to have chronic pain. It's no picnic
to witness the suffering of a beloved or even one occasionally
ranking slightly lower on the USA (Universal Scale of Affection). You
feel helpless. You want to aid, to offer a gentle, caring word, a
soothing liquid or touch, even a chance for the sufferer to vent
anger at a handy, safe target. Ah, ah, ah! No, no, no! You can't do
that now. Only makes things worse.</TE>
<TE>   Better to provide a distraction, change the subject, initiate a
new activity. Really. That is what the Germans say. This is actually
an approach adopted at the very start of the TV age by the hairier
half of America's marrieds. Now, that male response apparently has
official sanction from German scientists who, to be candid, do not
sound very married. The next time she enters the family room wincing
and complaining of pain, the study seems to suggest that any caring
husband should immediately say: "Hon, did you see that catch?" Or, "I
see where Dusty Baker left the Giants." Better yet, "Sweetheart, grab
your glove. We'll play some catch and get your mind off this silly
pain talk."</TE>
<TE>   One theory suggests that such statements could cause a sudden
transfer of pain from the wife to the helpful husband. But that is,
for now, merely anecdotal.</TE>

<HD>Labels' Online Hope: New Enhanced CDs</HD>
<DH>In a new strategy for fighting piracy, music firms offer
songs, contests and other Web extras that can be accessed only with
the discs. But will consumers buy?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recording artists may moan about consumers grabbing free music off
the Internet and burning their own CDs, but that's exactly what punk
band Sum 41 is inviting fans to do.</LD>
<LD>   Before downloading the free live recordings, though, fans will
need to buy something: the band's new CD, "Does This Look Infected?"
It's their plastic pass to the virtual concert hall.</LD>
<LD>   The forthcoming release from Sum 41 typifies what a growing number
of bands and record labels are doing to combat piracy on the Net. To
persuade consumers to buy the CD instead of downloading free
unauthorized copies online, they're offering an assortment of songs,
contests and other goodies that can be obtained only with the disc.</LD>
<TE>   This new generation of enhanced CDs tries to tap consumers'
enthusiasm for playing music on their computers, rather than trying
to squelch it like some of the labels' anti-piracy efforts. Enhanced
CDs also aim to help labels and artists establish a direct,
continuing connection with fans. It's a bit like the extra features
on a DVD movie, but the bonuses are stored online where they can be
updated and personalized.</TE>
<TE>   Some enhanced CDs can even track which songs from the album
consumers are playing and give companies instant feedback on where
the CD is selling. This kind of monitoring may unnerve some
consumers, but the companies involved insist that there's no threat
to privacy.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to fighting piracy, the technology has some notable
shortcomings. With a few exceptions, consumers with homemade or
pirated copies of the original disc can still obtain the online
bonuses. And in most cases, the extras are appealing only to the
band's biggest fans -- the ones most likely to buy the CD anyway.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the public's response to enhanced CDs has been lukewarm at
best. Industry executives say that only 5% to 10% of people who buy
the average enhanced CD use the special features.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Phil Leigh at Raymond James &amp; Associates, an investment
bank, said the main thing consumers want is a disc full of songs they
like. If an enhanced CD "still has only three tracks out of 12 they
want," Leigh said, the online extras aren't going to be enough.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all this, enhanced CDs are gaining momentum across the
music industry. Artists releasing enhanced CDs this fall include such
leading names as Santana -- whose enhanced CD "Shaman" debuted at the
top of the Billboard charts -- Bon Jovi, Tori Amos and Jennifer
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can enhance, we will," said Jordan Katz, senior vice
president of sales at Arista Records, a subsidiary of
Bertelsmann-owned BMG. "You will see a lot of our artists with
enhanced CDs."</TE>
<TE>   Several label executives said enhanced CDs aren't just about
fighting piracy; they also provide an outlet for more of an artist's
material. And the extras they provide aren't the only ones the labels
are stuffing into CD packages. For example, rapper Eminem included a
bonus DVD in the first 2 million copies of his latest album.</TE>
<TE>   A recent informal poll by Billboard magazine's Web site suggests
that Internet-savvy music fans may be warming to enhanced CDs. Nearly
60% of the 5,000 Web surfers who took part in the poll responded
favorably to the extra features, while the rest said the bonuses
played no role in their decision whether to buy a disc, Billboard.com
reported.</TE>
<TE>   Enhanced CDs have been on the market at least since the mid-1990s,
but the technology has changed significantly over the years. The
early versions offered text and graphics that were pressed onto the
disc and couldn't be updated. Some also included a link to a special
Web site, but those sites were accessible to anyone who knew their
Web addresses, not just those who bought the CD.</TE>
<TE>   The latest versions are more sophisticated. Rather than having
bonus features on the disc, as DVD movies do, the latest enhanced CDs
typically include only the electronic keys needed to gain access to
extra benefits online. Another approach is to include a customized
Web browser and online chat software that launches automatically when
the disc is played on an Net-connected computer.</TE>
<TE>   Island Def Jam Music Group, a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal,
goes one step further on the latest Bon Jovi and Sum 41 releases.
Users not only must possess the disc, they also must enter a unique
code from the CD package to get the extras.</TE>
<TE>   To executives at Sony Corp., which has been issuing enhanced CDs
since 1995, the most important difference is that most music fans now
have computers and Internet connections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Making Old New Again</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, the limited initial audience made it harder to
persuade artists and label executives to make online extras part of
the marketing plan, said Fred Ehrlich, president of new technology
and business development at Sony Music Entertainment. "Now, in label
meetings, the marketing people, the people who are creating the music
and the video, they're looking at how their creations could be used"
to enhance CDs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Any CD can be turned into an enhanced -- or "ConnecteD," in Sony
parlance -- product, even those already on store shelves. That's
because the technology for recognizing discs is at the Web site, not
on the discs themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That means labels can update and refresh old releases with new
material, just as movie studios re-release movies on DVD with new
commentary tracks and bonus features. Not only could the technology
extend the shelf life of a CD, it also enables artists and labels to
keep wooing fans long after they have bought the disc.</TE>
<TE>   Another option is to use an enhanced CD to promote the band's next
release or a disc by a related artist, said Daniel Sloop, vice
president of business development at Infotects Inc., which makes
CD-recognition software. For example, a month before the band
Disturbed released its latest CD, it gave fans who bought its
previous release a chance to listen to the new tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Katz of Arista said an artist's biggest fans are going to buy a
new CD right away, whether or not they know about any enhancements.
But the online extras can add to those buyers' enthusiasm for the
disc after they take it home, leading them to talk it up to their
friends and, potentially, sustaining sales after the first week, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A major problem for the labels has been the sharp decline in sales
of hit records after the first week, which many executives blame on
people recording copies of CDs for their friends. "If you have this
enhanced component, when you tell your friend about it, that may
discourage CD burning," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   The Santana CD uses Bandlink software from Javakitty Media Inc. of
Atlanta to connect listeners to the Web, where they can watch the
band's latest music video, hear an unreleased track, see interviews
and collect information about Carlos Santana. It also enables people
to chat online with other fans.</TE>
<TE>   The objective, said Javakitty co-founder Cedric Gore, is to create
a virtual listening party where people can trade messages while
playing the disc. Yet the technology's not quite at that point --
anyone with the Bandlink software can join the chat, regardless of
whether they have the CD.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Kind of Charting</TE>
<TE>   The Bandlink software also was designed to give labels and artists
more feedback on their records. The software monitors which songs on
the CD are played, revealing which ones are popular and which ones
aren't. That's extremely valuable information for executives and
artists picking singles to promote or songs to perform live. And if
users fill out the registration information and reveal where they
are, Javakitty can report the cities or even ZIP Codes where the CD
is selling well.</TE>
<TE>   Gore said the information is presented as a composite, and "none
of it's traceable back to an individual." But unless users read the
software's licensing agreement or privacy policy -- the online
equivalent of a contract's fine print -- they won't be aware that
Bandlink is monitoring what they play.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, labels and artists would update the online component of
an enhanced CD every few months, said Larry Kenswil, president of
Universal Music Group's ELabs. The limiting factor, though, is cost.
The labels charge the same for enhanced CDs as for conventional ones,
so money spent on the extras comes out of the disc's profit.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with artists routinely making behind-the-scenes videos and
live recordings, there's no shortage of low-cost material for
enhancements, Kenswil said. "We're finding that things like concert
tickets and exclusive Web access work best, but that may very well
vary from artist to artist and genre to genre," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Content is king," said Sloop of Infotects. "The cooler the stuff,
the higher the percentage [of users]. If you have stuff that wouldn't
even make the B side, that's not very compelling."</TE>

<HD>For Trump, Risks and Riches Are Par for the Course</HD>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is a story about how the rich get richer.</LD>
<LD>   Donald Trump is buying Ocean Trails in Rancho Palos Verdes, the
golf course that attained notoriety three years ago when its 18th
hole fell, kerplunk, into the Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   That collapse, which was found to be the result of a busted sewer
pipe, sent the golf course's developers, Robert and Kenneth
Zuckerman, into bankruptcy proceedings. It cost the main lender,
Credit Suisse First Boston, most of its $100-million loan. And it
stuck a collection of insurance companies with some $61 million in
claims payments, some of which the bank is using to rebuild that
final hole.</LD>
<TE>   In the intervening years, several developers took a look at the
golf course with an eye toward buying it at a discount and operating
it profitably. No one, though, had the guts to make a bid.</TE>
<TE>   "They just couldn't see enough golfers paying enough to make the
place work," says Los Angeles developer Robert Lowe, who is about to
build a luxury hotel nearby. Nor were these timid shoppers too sure
about the stability of the ground -- and for good reason. Ocean
Trails, according to Ken Zuckerman, is dotted with what geologists
call "ancient slide areas."</TE>
<TE>   But Trump, the New York mogul, is stepping in where others feared
to tread. "That land is solid," he says with characteristic
certainty. "We checked carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Trump is paying $27 million for the golf course, which comes with
adjacent building lots to accommodate 75 houses. In an area where
nearby homes are selling for $1 million to $2 million apiece, the
overall price is a bargain -- so much so that Trump can now afford to
pump a lot of dough into upgrading the property.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to put in $30 million more to build the finest course
in California," explains Trump, himself a six-handicap golfer. "I'll
build elegant holes -- all of them facing the ocean -- and a driving
range and practice area."</TE>
<TE>   One idea he has is to turn Ocean Trails into a high-end private
club, much like he has done with two golf courses in posh Palm Beach,
Fla., and New York's opulent Westchester County.</TE>
<TE>   At Ocean Trails, he can see charging private club members as much
as $300,000 just to join. "Do the numbers," says Trump. "Three
hundred members at $300,000 each comes to $90 million."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he might turn a big profit even without building
and selling houses along the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it won't be that simple. Les Evans, the city manager of
Rancho Palos Verdes, points out that there are deed restrictions
requiring Ocean Trails (which the new owner wants to name Trump
National) to be a public course.</TE>
<TE>   Changing that, says Evans, would take decisions by the town and
the California Coastal Commission, which governs oceanfront property.
In the end, Trump may be well advised not to go that route; it took
the Zuckermans 10 years to get the necessary approvals to build the
original Ocean Trails.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if the course is opened to the public, Trump still seems
to have a highly profitable venture on his hands.</TE>
<TE>   As he has so many times before, Trump has spotted a trend to tap.</TE>
<TE>   "Luxury golf is a growth industry," says Richard F. Davis, an
expert in resorts law and finance in the Los Angeles offices of the
firm Greenberg Traurig. Pebble Beach, the famed public course in
Northern California, is getting $175 to $200 for a round of golf and
has a six-month waiting list to play. And Pelican Hills, a public
course near Newport Beach, is snaring $185 to $200 a round.</TE>
<TE>   Those kinds of numbers add up fast.</TE>
<TE>   "A top-class public course in the Los Angeles market could be a
big winner," Davis says.</TE>
<TE>   Trump certainly doesn't win them all. Like all builders, the
56-year-old has had his rocky moments. A decade ago he put one of his
casinos, the Taj Mahal, into bankruptcy proceedings and had to
persuade lenders to keep his principal company afloat. And early this
year Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. faced a threat of default on
massive debts.</TE>
<TE>   But a recovery in the gambling sector has improved Trump Hotels'
fortunes. And Trump's development company is finishing a big
apartment structure on New York's Park Avenue and 7,000 housing units
overlooking the Hudson River on Manhattan's West Side. "I'm the
largest developer in New York City," the billionaire says proudly.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a key to understanding the Ocean Trails deal: Trump is
thinking grandly, not narrowly.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll build better than Pebble Beach," he vows.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an apartment house developer, whose own son has entered
the business, Trump understands above all the value of land --
especially when it includes a view.</TE>
<TE>   With Ocean Trails, he will own 300 acres on the Pacific Ocean.
"It's almost impossible to think of such an opportunity," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There is no telling how Trump's brash style will suit the Palos
Verdes Peninsula, where finicky residents have made life tough for
developers, including one who went bust trying to revive the former
Marineland aquarium site where Lowe Enterprises Inc. is building its
hotel complex.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Trump could be just what the area, which suffered a decline in
its tax base during the last recession, is looking for. "I think
he'll give the community cachet," says Ray Mathys, a former mayor of
Rancho Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   Trump says he intends to own the golf course for the long term,
and adds that financing his dreams there won't be a problem. "I may
take a first mortgage but I'm going to own it," he says. "I'm a rich
guy."</TE>
<TE>   And, it would seem, getting more so all the time.</TE>

<HD>New Buzz Making Waves on High-Tech Film Sets</HD>
<DH>Interference from wireless devices and other electronic
gear can cause baffling -- and expensive -- delays in moviemaking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. Huffstutter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cinematographer Brian Heller thought all systems were go as he
prepared to shoot inside a New York apartment building for the film
"Code of Ethics." The set looked elegant. The cast, poised for its
cue, stood ready.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, the camera jerked to a stop. On a second try, it did it
again. The circuitry inside the camera fizzled.</LD>
<LD>   A crew member eventually pinpointed the problem: a burglar alarm
one floor below that was emitting a strong burst of microwaves.</LD>
<TE>   As moviemaking becomes increasingly high tech, Hollywood film
crews are finding themselves at odds with the technology that
permeates everyday life. They sit on the cutting edge of a global
laboratory in which millions of computer chips, hordes of wireless
devices and even ordinary contraptions can wreak havoc on their
productions.</TE>
<TE>   In a world where science and art must mesh, the list of unexpected
electronic conflicts ranges from simple to simply baffling. They
typically are the consequence of the wrong technologies being in the
same space at the same time. These anomalies often are impossible to
predict and can be nearly as difficult to remedy.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're working with a traditional film camera and it breaks,
you can look at it and pretty much figure out what's wrong," said
cinematographer James Matlosz. "A film camera's a machine. A digital
camera's a computer. If the computer stops working, what do you do?"</TE>
<TE>   All manner of gizmos have been subject to technological
interference. A high-powered walkie-talkie being used too close to a
sensitive power generator confused its internal timing processor and
sent it into shutdown mode, killing the lights during filming of a
poignant moment in the summer blockbuster "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   And during a creepy scene in last year's camp horror film "Out of
the Darkness" at an old hotel in upstate New York, a dormant pool
pump sprang to life with ear-splitting screeches. It was
inadvertently turned on when the crew plugged a generator into an
antiquated electrical system.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like someone was sauteing a cat," producer Richard
Miller recalled. "It took us 20 minutes to figure out what it was."</TE>
<TE>   For Hollywood, the most common electronic hiccups are caused by
radio waves. Like light waves, radio waves consist of oscillating
electric and magnetic fields that roam through space. A key
difference between radio and light waves rests in the technologies
that are used to detect them -- and the ones that are affected by
them.</TE>
<TE>   Computers, televisions, cameras, cell phones and even coffee
makers are embedded with tiny electronic components and circuits that
often allow these machines to interact with each other. But these
components also may emit undesired radio- frequency waves that create
an ocean of buzz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Polluted Environment</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the radio spectrum is divvied up by the Federal
Communications Commission to avoid this chaos in the air. But when
the circumstances are right, the lines of division can blur, allowing
the ghost in the machine to take over.</TE>
<TE>   "We're living in a polluted radio environment," said Martin
Cooper, chief executive of Arraycomm Inc., a San Jose-based firm that
makes tools to enhance wireless technologies. "These kinds of
problems are only going to increase."</TE>
<TE>   Of all the tools that can crash, the worst to lose is a camera.
Digital cameras use powerful computer chips to convert light to
electronic pulses, which are translated into data and stored on
videotape. Even film cameras, which are basically mechanical, rely on
electronic parts that emit a subtle buzz.</TE>
<TE>   Film and digital camera manufacturers have attempted to shield
their equipment from meddlesome radio-frequency waves, but nothing
has been totally successful, noted Larry Thorpe, senior vice
president of content creation for camera maker Sony Electronics Inc.
in Park Ridge, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only test your technology so much," added Stuart English,
vice president of marketing for Panasonic Broadcast &amp; Television
Systems Co. in Secaucus, N.J., which provides digital cameras to news
and film crews. "What takes over is field testing, or testing by
experience. They find the problems, and we learn from them."</TE>
<TE>   Such was the case with the 2001 Imax film, "Pittsburgh's Big
Picture." Matlosz and his crew had their gear set up on a rooftop
overlooking an industrial skyline. The sun, just setting, painted the
horizon in rich hues.</TE>
<TE>   The massive camera suddenly began to "hiccup uncontrollably,"
advancing the film at wildly varying speeds, Matlosz said. The
baffled crew, eager not to miss the shot, scoured the camera for
clues.</TE>
<TE>   "Our heads were bobbing and weaving, looking all around for what
was wrong, like a loose wire or a switch in the wrong position," he
said. After nearly an hour, the crew deduced that the culprit was a
forest of nearby cell-phone towers that sent bursts of radio waves.</TE>
<TE>   Such delays can become expensive problems for production crews,
which are under constant pressure to deliver their films on time and
within budget.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, many moviemakers say one of the first things they do
when they walk onto a set is to look for cell-phone towers, satellite
dishes and even skyscrapers topped with antennas and digital
receivers so they can make sure that the effects of potentially
conflicting devices are accounted for when the cameras are rolling.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to know where the hot spots are and where you just can't
shoot," said cinematographer Heller, who shot "Code of Ethics" in
1997. "That alarm ate up a couple hours of shooting. For us, time's
money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Meter Is Running</TE>
<TE>   Delays can be expensive for studios and filmmakers. The average
cost of making a movie reached $47.7 million in 2001. Television
productions cost as much as $1 million per half-hour, up 20% in the
last three years. Even short delays can be costly. Producers say the
cost for a typical day of shooting for a Hollywood film is about
$100,000, or $5,500 to $7,000 an hour. That means a 10-minute pause
to clear up walkie-talkie interference can cost $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has dealt with strange mishaps on sets since the
earliest days of celluloid. Around the turn of the 20th century,
director Georges Melies hid camera flaws and effects foibles by
hiring scores of women to hand-tint each print of "Voyage to the
Moon."</TE>
<TE>   The newer electronic conflicts are the modern "vacuum in the
living room" problem, where the simple task of cleaning can cause
static on a TV screen.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the conflicts are more annoying than serious. While
shooting the upcoming Jim Carrey film "Bruce Almighty" in downtown
Los Angeles a few months ago, the crew could barely hear one another
on their walkie-talkies.</TE>
<TE>   The problem? The police and fire departments had filled the
airwaves with their own walkie-talkie chatter, and the cameras and
equipment of another film crew working around the corner threw off
another conflicting layer of electronic buzz.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the same thing happen on 'Liar Liar' when we were shooting
out at LAX," producer Jim Brubaker said. "It's a few minutes' delay
here, a few minutes' there. It's just a way of life."</TE>

<LD>Consider how much better our health-care system could work if it were
divorced from employment ("Radical Surgery Is Needed on the Way
America Finances Health Care," James Flanigan, Nov. 10).</LD>
<LD>   If we could roll the clock back 60 years and start fresh, we'd
never, knowing what we know now, make employment the nexus for health
insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Notwithstanding the theoretical interest employers have in the
health of their employees, virtually all employers who offer health
insurance would rather be free of that responsibility.</LD>
<TE>   The negativity associated with the era of managed care is a
byproduct of the desire of employers to become disengaged from the
expense and the problem-laden aspects of providing employee health
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Duncan</TE>
<TE>   Buena Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The only viable option for salvaging health care is a federally
administered single-payer system. Companies such as PacifiCare Health
Systems Inc. are part of the problem, not the solution.</TE>
<TE>   Why should health-care resources go to corporate profit and
double-digit overhead when Medicare operates with an overhead of 2%?
Most industrialized countries enjoy better health care than the U.S.
by spending 8% to 9% of GNP in single-payer systems, while we waste
15% of ours on a system that provides no care to 41 million and
insufficient care to many more.</TE>

<TE>   Redlands</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am a registered nurse with 20 years of stories to tell that can
rival what has been reported about Tenet Healthcare Corp.</TE>
<TE>   This is just the tip of the iceberg. Tenet is not alone. Just
about every hospital I have worked at overdoes everything. The public
has been sold a myth that there is a shortage of health care.</TE>
<TE>   Unnecessary tests, procedures and medications are symptoms of a
third-party-payer system and an ever-increasing population of people
in our socialized medical programs.</TE>
<TE>   Kathryn Ellison</TE>
<TE>   El Segundo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As an employee of Tenet (not a spokesperson), I would like to
correct your perception of this particular issue.</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals, including Tenet, do not bill specific amounts to
Medicare for outliers [special Medicare funds that are paid to
hospitals for unusually costly procedures].</TE>
<TE>   The payment amount is calculated by Medicare's fiscal intermediary
and has absolutely nothing to do with the amount billed.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare uses the hospitals' cost reports from two to three years
earlier, or the statewide average, to determine reasonable and
customary charges.</TE>
<TE>   Are Medicare outliers a quirky bureaucratic process? Absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   Did Tenet raise charges to all payers equally over several years
to combat declining reimbursement managed-care contracts? Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Did this have an unintended effect of altering Medicare's outlier
calculation? Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Does Tenet have a serious PR issue to overcome? Yes.</TE>
<TE>   Has Tenet overbilled or aggressively pursued or boosted outlier
payments? Absolutely impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Petrasich</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think you have succinctly identified a chunk of the problem.
Longevity does increase costs of treatment. So do health-care
advances in the form of new drugs, new tests and new treatments.</TE>
<TE>   Every advance expands the testable and treatable patient base.
More tests, more treatments, higher costs.</TE>

<HD>Don't Expect Insurer to Match 21-Year-Old Siding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Two months ago my neighbor backed her car into my house. My
home, which was built in 1981, has a type of siding on it that isn't
manufactured anymore. The insurance company wants to replace the
damaged siding with the closest thing they can find and call it good.
I will admit that the siding they propose is a close match, but I
don't believe they are making a genuine attempt to correct the
problem. I am honestly not looking to take advantage of the company,
but my home siding matched before their insured driver backed into it
and now it doesn't. What can I do?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The question is what, exactly, you expect the insurer to
do. Go into the business of manufacturing a discontinued siding,
perhaps? Even if it could or would, the siding still wouldn't match,
you know. It would be new, whereas your siding is 21 years old.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps you're hoping the insurer will replace all your siding.
That's not much more realistic than hoping it'll go into the
manufacturing business. You can always ask, but it's probably not
worth pushing the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Your best course is to accept the repair and get on with your
life. In a few years, the new siding will start to get that comfy,
worn look the rest of your siding has, and you probably won't even
notice the difference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Refinancing of Multiple Properties</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm looking for unbiased information about refinancing my
mortgage debt. I'm getting lots of unsolicited refinancing offers in
the mail, but my concern is that I've been unemployed since March and
I'm not sure the offers I'm getting reflect the interest rate I'd
really pay. My wife and I owe $121,000 on our first mortgage, $51,000
on our second and $31,000 for a vacation condo. We'd like to get one
loan to refinance all three debts. My wife makes $40,000 as a nurse,
and I get a $12,000 pension from the military in addition to $17,000
in unemployment benefits that will end in a year. Our house is worth
$189,000 to $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   A: Your biggest problem isn't your unemployment, because your
income probably is adequate for a $203,000 loan. The problem is that
you want to borrow more than your house probably is worth. Though
some lenders do make these loans, you typically pay through the nose
for them.</TE>
<TE>   Even if your house is appraised for more than the loan, part of
the money is going to pay for another property, which would make most
lenders view this as a "cash-out" refinancing, said mortgage broker
Allen Bond, president of the California Assn. of Mortgage Brokers'
southern Los Angeles County chapter. Cash-out refinancings tend to
have higher rates and more restrictions on how much you can borrow.</TE>
<TE>   If you did get a $203,000 loan, you wouldn't be able to deduct
interest on the amount that exceeds the value of your house.</TE>
<TE>   A mortgage broker could give you some idea of your options, as
well as what your payments might be in various scenarios. (The
mortgage brokers association in your state can offer referrals.) You
would need to compare those with what you're paying now and factor in
closing costs and other expenses of refinancing.</TE>
<TE>   Unless your current rates are awfully high, it probably doesn't
make much sense to try to include all three debts in one refinancing.
In general, you get the best deals in mortgages if you keep at least
10% equity in the property. In other words, you should try not to
borrow more than 90% of the value of your home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What's Considered a Good FICO Score?</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband and I recently requested our credit reports to
verify that the information contained is accurate, because we are
preparing to get a mortgage. We also got our FICO credit score, but
we're not sure what's considered a good score. Can you tell us?</TE>
<TE>   A: Different lenders have different standards for what's "good"
when it comes to credit scores, which are the three-digit numbers
they use to gauge your credit-worthiness.</TE>
<TE>   Usually anything above 720 will get you a good rate on a loan.
About half of American adults have credit scores above this mark.</TE>
<TE>   Note to readers: I erred two weeks ago in telling a reader that
early-withdrawal penalties would not apply to his IRA distributions
because he would be older than 55 when he leaves his job. In fact,
penalties are waived for employees 55 and older when the withdrawals
come from workplace retirement plans such as 401(k)s. IRAs don't
qualify for the over-55 exemption.</TE>
<TE>   It is correct, however, that early-withdrawal penalties for IRA
distributions can be avoided regardless of the account owner's age as
long as the withdrawals are based on the owner's life expectancy.</TE>

<HD>Moving On After Financial Scandals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quick -- name the most recent big corporate accounting scandal.</LD>
<LD>   If only WorldCom Inc. comes to mind, that's a good answer. And
note the date: WorldCom's revelation that it would have to restate
$3.9 billion of expenses came in late June.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the telecom giant has raised its restatement tally to
more than $9 billion. But the rumors that racked the stock market in
July -- that many more WorldComs or mini-WorldComs were in the wings
-- didn't pan out.</LD>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying before a
congressional committee July 17, predicted that there would be
"significant restatements" of corporate earnings ahead of the Aug. 14
deadline for chief executives of the largest U.S. companies to
certify their firms' financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   But the deadline came and went, the vast majority of CEOs
certified as required, and the expected restatement wave never
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   To Robert Olstein, a Purchase, N.Y.-based money manager who has
gained renown for paying close attention to corporate balance sheets
and income statements for 30 years, accounting scandals are
"yesterday's story," as he puts it.</TE>
<TE>   It was a big story, to be sure -- and the search for the guilty
could go on for a long time. The Securities and Exchange Commission
continues to pursue bookkeeping investigations at many companies that
will keep the agency's lawyers, and those of corporate defendants,
busy for years. New probes are certain to be opened.</TE>
<TE>   And the national accounting oversight board created by Congress in
summer and now struggling to launch itself while it awaits a new
chairman (after the first one, William H. Webster, resigned under
fire) may next year have new ideas about what's legitimate financial
reporting and what isn't.</TE>
<TE>   But Olstein, whose Olstein &amp; Associates manages $1.3 billion,
believes investors are missing the boat if they're too frightened or
disgusted to research and buy stocks because of fears that corporate
books have universally been cooked.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's move on," Olstein said. Major accounting scandals have
occurred repeatedly in American history, he said. Something else also
has occurred repeatedly, he notes: Corporate profitability -- genuine
profitability -- has rebounded after recessions, making many stocks
more attractive investments.</TE>
<TE>   The message may seem flip in a year when trillions of dollars in
equity market value has been wiped out at least in part because of
corporate chicanery. But Olstein's point is that investors should
spend more of their time looking ahead now, not behind.</TE>
<TE>   His hard-nosed focus on balance sheets and income statements,
hunting for companies whose true earnings power doesn't appear to be
reflected in their share prices, has delivered an average annual
return of 3.4% to shareholders of his Olstein Financial Alert fund
over the last three years, during the worst bear market in a
generation.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the average U.S. stock mutual fund has lost 8.2% a
year in the same period, according to Morningstar Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Now Olstein is looking for a recovery in corporate earnings in
2003 to lift the stock market as well. He views the market overall as
"fairly valued" today, which leaves room for stocks to advance if
underlying earnings do too, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, disgraced though their profession may be in
the eyes of many investors, still are useful as a point of reference
for corporate earnings expectations. According to estimates-tracker
Thomson First Call, analysts predict that operating earnings for the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 companies will rise about 2% this year,
beginning to revive from last year's plunge.</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, analysts expect S&amp;P 500 earnings to jump 14.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Putting aside the perennial issue of whether analysts are too
optimistic, many investors may view the key question as whether any
earnings rebound reported by companies can be trusted. How do we know
the numbers are real, given the accounting tricks that seemingly were
widespread in the late 1990s?</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics can argue that the only reason a massive earnings
restatement wave didn't precede CEOs' financial-certification
deadline in August is that most CEOs are hoping they won't get caught
-- in other words, that an overburdened SEC won't be able to identify
everyone who played fast and loose with accounting during the boom
years.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC still is very much in the hunt. Copper producer Phelps
Dodge Corp. last week disclosed that the SEC is examining the
company's accounting for mining properties where Phelps had cut
production. The probe could result in new write-offs against
previously reported results, the company said. Its stock fell 9% for
the week.</TE>
<TE>   Still, investors shouldn't discount that there are very good
reasons that true earnings can bounce sharply after recessions,
Olstein said.</TE>
<TE>   For one, corporate cost-cutting usually is fierce during and after
recessions. It's still going on at many companies, both in terms of
staff cuts and reductions in capital spending and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A Business Roundtable survey of 150 CEOs of major companies,
reported last week, showed that 60% expect to cut jobs in 2003 --
even though an even higher percentage expect that their companies'
sales will rise.</TE>
<TE>   Higher sales with lower costs set the table for more money to fall
directly to the bottom line -- the essence of earnings leverage.</TE>
<TE>   With their cost-cutting, many companies have taken what Olstein
calls "kitchen-sink write-offs" over the last two years, as excess
and inefficient production capacity has been closed or sold.</TE>
<TE>   Investors may tire of such supposedly "one-time" write-offs
occurring repeatedly, but for companies that have legitimately worked
to become more efficient, those write-offs should be near an end and
won't be dirtying-up income statements in 2003, Olstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, companies that have cut capacity should face lower
depreciation expenses, which also can boost the bottom line (though
depreciation, as Olstein notes, is a non-cash charge in any case).</TE>
<TE>   Olstein still has one big concern about 2003 earnings: the
potential hit some companies will take because they are using
unrealistic assumptions about what their employee pension funds will
earn. If those targets aren't reached, firms may have to ante-up more
pension cash.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Olstein is optimistic that what he has long termed
the "quality of earnings" will improve next year. And with it, he
said, will come the potential for higher stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   "The quality of earnings always goes up at the end of bear
markets," he said. There's no reason to believe that this time will
be different, he said.</TE>
<TE>   For investors who believe that earnings will continue to rebound
in 2003, and that they'll be real enough, the issue is how to value
them -- that is, how high a share price to pay for $1 of reported
earnings per share.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Keon, an investment strategist at Prudential Securities in New
York, makes the case that the true earnings that will be generated by
S&amp;P 500 companies this year will be equal to what they generated in
1997, though down sharply from the results reported in the boom years
of 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   If earnings are back to 1997 levels, where are share prices? The
S&amp;P 500 index, at 909.83 on Friday, is 6% below its 970.43 closing
level at the end of 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Keon notes, interest rates are far below their levels
of 1997, and inflation also is lower.</TE>
<TE>   If the world as we know it doesn't end, and even allowing for
slower earnings growth in the next few years than during the boom
years, if stocks are judged against interest rates and inflation they
are "very cheap," Keon contends.</TE>

<LD>Tech Stocks Extend Recent Recovery</LD>
<LD>   Technology stocks continued their recent recovery last week as
investors shrugged off bad news in the sector and concerns about
terrorism and the strength of the U.S. economy.</LD>
<LD>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 3.8% for the week,
bringing its gain to almost 27% since hitting a multiyear low Oct. 9.
The gains came despite some negative news, such as a profit warning
from chip equipment maker Applied Materials.</LD>
<TE>   Nontech areas of the market didn't fare as well but still managed
to post gains for the week. The Dow Jones industrials inched up 0.5%.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 1.7%.</TE>

<TE>   Webster Steps Down From Accounting Panel</TE>
<TE>   Former FBI Director William H. Webster resigned the top post of a
new watchdog board created to address the recent wave of corporate
accounting scandals. He said there was a "perfect storm" of
controversy surrounding his appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's action capped weeks of tumult stemming from a bitterly
divided 3-2 vote of the Securities and Exchange Commission on Oct. 25
that approved his nomination. Since then, a major accounting firm
accused Webster, 78, of making "false and misleading statements"
about his awareness of financial problems at a small company at which
he had been a director.</TE>
<TE>   The political fallout led to the resignations this month of SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, who championed Webster's nomination, as well
as the SEC's top accountant, Robert Herdman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Taps Diller to Play Broader Role</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood deal maker Barry Diller was tapped by Vivendi
Universal's top executive, Jean-Rene Fourtou, to be interim co-chief
executive of the ailing Paris-based conglomerate's U.S. entertainment
division.</TE>
<TE>   That part of the corporation is now being rejiggered to add the
lucrative games unit and Universal Music Group to Diller's existing
portfolio: Universal's movie studio, theme parks and television
properties.</TE>
<TE>   The move came amid criminal investigations in France and the
United States over allegations of financial improprieties, including
whether Vivendi's former chief executive misled investors about the
severity of the company's financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   Since the ouster of former CEO Jean-Marie Messier in a boardroom
coup, Hollywood corridors have been rife with speculation about the
future of Universal and Diller, who is widely known for his business
savvy and survival instincts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   California to Settle Suits Against Williams</TE>
<TE>   California agreed to settle lawsuits against Williams Cos., one of
the major power companies accused of price gouging during the energy
crisis. In exchange, the company has agreed to make concessions and
payments that the state says could exceed $1.8 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis and Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer announced the
settlement with Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams days after federal
prosecutors signaled they were pressing ahead with a criminal
investigation of alleged manipulation of energy prices in California
and issued subpoenas to Williams and four other firms.</TE>
<TE>   However, new evidence emerged late in the week that AES Corp. and
Williams conspired to squeeze electricity supplies to California in
early 2000, drawing an angry response from state officials and
threatening the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In its deal with California, Williams agreed to renegotiate $4.3
billion in long-term power contracts with the state.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Compaq CEO to Head WorldCom</TE>
<TE>   Michael Capellas was named to head WorldCom Inc. as the
telecommunications company tries to shake off accounting scandals and
retain customers.</TE>
<TE>   Capellas, 48, will replace interim Chief Executive John Sidgmore
and Chairman Bert Roberts, effective Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, Capellas announced he would resign as
president of Hewlett-Packard Co., walking away from the newly merged
computer maker with nearly $14 million in bonuses. The former CEO of
Compaq Computer Corp., who helped engineer its merger with
Hewlett-Packard, won't be replaced when he steps down Dec. 1.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom has been operating under bankruptcy protection since July
and aims to emerge intact in mid-2003.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NASA Decides to Extend Life of Shuttle</TE>
<TE>   NASA had welcome news for thousands of Southern California space
shuttle workers as the agency scrubbed plans for a reusable launch
vehicle and decided instead to extend the life of the shuttle another
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that perfecting a reusable rocket technology could
take 15 years, NASA said that in the interim it wanted to develop a
smaller, less ambitious orbital space plane capable of ferrying
astronauts to the International Space Station.</TE>
<TE>   NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe outlined the strategy shift as
part of his broad new plan for transporting crews into space. The
agency's revised spending proposal was signed by President Bush and
forwarded to Congress for approval.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Won't Pursue Penalties at Ports</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said it will not pursue contempt penalties
against the dockworkers union or shipping companies for contributing
to slowdowns in violation of a court order to keep West Coast ports
moving normally.</TE>
<TE>   The statement was filed with the U.S. District Court in San
Francisco before a status conference involving the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn., which
represents shipping lines and terminal operators.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides are working under an Oct. 8 federal injunction that
reopened ports after a 10-day lockout. Mediated contract negotiations
resumed last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redding Doctors Keep Their Licenses</TE>
<TE>   Two doctors who are under investigation for allegedly performing
unnecessary operations at Tenet Healthcare Corp.'s Redding Medical
Center got to keep their licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Shasta County Superior Court Judge Monica Marlow ruled that the
California Medical Board's evidence against cardiologist Chae Hyun
Moon and heart surgeon Fidel Realyvasquez was insufficient to stop
them from practicing.</TE>
<TE>   "She sent a message that these kinds of proceedings cannot and
should not be based on innuendo, hearsay and double hearsay," said
William Warne, Moon's lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Realyvasquez lawyer Robert H. Zimmerman said the board "fired a
dud."</TE>
<TE>   The board had sought temporary restraining orders in the wake of
an FBI investigation of the doctors' work. The FBI is probing alleged
Medicare fraud, but the Medical Board was seeking the suspensions
solely on public safety grounds. Neither the doctors nor Tenet has
been charged with any crime.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Key3Media Plans to Explore a Sale or Merger</TE>
<TE>   Key3Media Group Inc., the Los Angeles-based company that runs the
huge computer show Comdex that opens today in Las Vegas, said that it
probably faces a sale or merger because it is plagued with losses and
can't pay its debt.</TE>
<TE>   Key3Media is being crushed by a heavy debt burden amid the
technology industry's collapse and post-Sept. 11 cuts in business
travel that have eroded attendance at shows such as Comdex. The
company runs other shows for buyers and sellers of electronic gear.</TE>
<TE>   Key3Media will explore a sale, merger or other restructuring,
perhaps using a bankruptcy reorganization to facilitate the overhaul,
the company said while announcing a quarterly loss. Pressure will
intensify after Dec. 16, when the company faces a debt payment of
about $15 million that it can't afford.</TE>

<HD>Year-End Preparations Can Lower Taxpayers' Bill</HD>
<DH>Realizing stock-market losses, making an early mortgage
payment or donating personal property before Dec. 31 can you save
money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taxes may be the last thing consumers want to deal with during the
holiday season, but making a few smart moves before the end of the
year could save taxpayers a bundle on their 2002 returns.</LD>
<LD>   "Get out your papers and pretend it's April 15th," advised Nick
Childers, senior financial consultant with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "See
what you can do to lower your tax bill and put a few more dollars in
your pocket in the coming year."</LD>
<LD>   Traditional sources of last-minute deductions include making
charitable donations, renewing work-related magazine subscriptions,
locking in losses on investments and doubling up on mortgage payments
and other deductible expenses.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to last year's federal tax-cut legislation, there's another
option: contributing more money to tax-advantaged retirement plans,
such as 401(k) accounts, said Don R. Weigandt, managing director at
J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 tax law increased the amount Americans can contribute to
retirement plans in 2002. The annual limit on 401(k) or 403(b) plan
contributions, for example, rose to $11,000 from $10,500 last year.
Maximum contributions to 457 plans also rose to $11,000 from $8,500.
And the annual limit on IRAs rose to $3,000 from $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing contributions to tax-deferred retirement savings
shields additional income from both state and federal income taxes.
And those age 50 and older can save even more, thanks to so-called
catch-up contributions, Weigandt said.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum allowable catch-up contribution this year is $1,000
for 401(k) or 403(b) plans and $500 for IRAs -- meaning a 50-year-old
with a 401(k) plan could contribute as much as $12,000 this year.</TE>
<TE>   "If you turn 50 in 2002 -- even if your birthday is on Dec. 31 --
you can make a catch-up contribution" this year, said Martin
Nissenbaum, tax partner at Ernst &amp; Young in New York.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to remember that retirement plan providers
generally won't make a catch-up contribution unless they are asked to
do so by the plan participant.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for 2002 tax returns, 401(k), 403(b) and 457 plan
contributions must be made by Dec. 31. IRA contributions can be made
until April 15, 2003, and still qualify for this year's tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some other tax-saving tips:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harvest Market Losses</TE>
<TE>   Investors who have seen the value of their stock holdings plummet
during the bear market may want to use those losses to shield
investment gains -- assuming they have any -- and to offset as much
as $3,000 in regular income from state and federal taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no write-offs for paper losses. To get the tax
break, investors must "realize" the loss by selling securities for
less than they paid.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an opportunity to take advantage of the downturn,"
Nissenbaum said. "See if you've got losses worth harvesting."</TE>
<TE>   Capital losses are used, first, to offset any capital gains
realized during the year -- that saves 20 cents on the dollar in
federal capital gains tax alone. In California, using capital losses
to offset capital gains saves closer to 29 cents on the dollar
because the state's top income tax rate is 9.3% and there isn't a
lower rate for capital gains.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, those with more capital losses than gains can use
excess losses to offset as much as $3,000 in ordinary income each
year. That saves even more, because ordinary federal income tax rates
run as high as 38.6%.</TE>
<TE>   What about securities that can't be sold because the company has
filed for bankruptcy protection or simply evaporated, rendering its
securities worthless?</TE>
<TE>   If a security is worthless, the taxpayer need do nothing but claim
the loss on his or her return, Nissenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   But if the security still trades -- even if it's only for pennies
a share -- the shares must be sold to take the loss, he said. Many
brokerage firms offer "penny for the lot" programs that allow
customers to get rid of near-worthless shares without paying a
brokerage commission.</TE>
<TE>   A reminder: If a security is repurchased within 31 days of its
sale, the transaction is dismissed by tax authorities as a "wash
sale" and the capital loss deduction would be disallowed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Make a Charitable Gift</TE>
<TE>   Planning a large charitable contribution before year's end? Those
who still have appreciated securities in their portfolios might
consider giving stock rather than cash, Childers of Merrill Lynch
said. The deduction is the same, and the giver won't have to pay the
capital gains tax when the security is eventually sold.</TE>
<TE>   Consider an investor who bought 500 shares of XYZ company five
years ago for $5,000. The stock now is valued at $10,000. If the
shares are sold and the proceeds given to charity, that's a $9,000
contribution -- the $10,000 from the sale minus the $1,000 tax on the
capital gain. A $9,000 gift nets the giver $2,700 in tax savings,
assuming an income tax rate of 30%.</TE>
<TE>   If the shares are given directly, the charity gets the whole
$10,000 -- and the investor gets a write-off for the entire amount.
Because the charity is tax exempt, no one has to pay the capital
gains tax when the shares are sold. The investor ends up saving
$3,000 in tax instead of $2,700.</TE>
<TE>   However, it doesn't make sense to donate depreciated securities.
In this case, it's wiser to sell first and give later. Why? Because
the charity can't use the capital loss and the donor can.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pay Taxes Early</TE>
<TE>   Property tax payments, billed in November, usually are due in two
installments -- one before year-end and one shortly after. Those
looking for an additional deduction can pay both before Dec. 31, said
George McCrimlisk, a Los Angeles tax partner at KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   But beware the alternative minimum tax -- a parallel tax system
that can hit people with large families and unusually high state and
local tax deductions. If the taxpayer falls under the AMT, the value
of the property-tax deduction is lost, which defeats the purpose of
prepaying the tax, McCrimlisk said.</TE>
<TE>   Before making the early property tax payment, run a tax projection
to make sure you're safe from the AMT.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bunch Expenses</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time to pay -- or delay -- dues for professional
memberships, work-related magazine and newspaper subscriptions, and
bills from lawyers and accountants for professional services.</TE>
<TE>   The decision about whether to pay these costs now or, if possible,
delay paying them until 2003 hinges on how many other miscellaneous
itemized deductions the taxpayer claimed in the last year. That's
because miscellaneous itemized deductions are deductible only once
they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. That makes it smart to push
two years' worth of expenses into one year whenever possible.</TE>
<TE>   For those who were unemployed during 2002, remember that
job-hunting expenses -- from resume preparation to travel costs --
are miscellaneous itemized deductions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Make Payment Early</TE>
<TE>   The mortgage bill that homeowners receive in January actually is
for interest expenses accrued in December. That makes it possible to
pay the bill in December and deduct the interest from 2002 income.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Give Personal Property</TE>
<TE>   When donating personal property to charity, taxpayers get a
deduction for the current market value of the item, or the amount
they paid for it, whichever is less. It's up to the taxpayer to
establish the market value at the time of the donation.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS recently simplified what taxpayers need to do when giving
a car to charity -- an area of huge growth and possible abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The agency stated that values in a standard car-pricing guide --
if matched to the donated vehicle's condition, age and mileage --
would be sufficient to establish market value, Weigandt said.
Taxpayers no longer need to get a professional appraisal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Check Withholding</TE>
<TE>   Taxpayers should do a tax projection at least a month before
year's end to ensure that enough money has been withheld from their
pay during the year to avoid a big tax bill -- and penalties -- in
April, Nissenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   To do this projection, pull out pay stubs, mortgage and investment
records and project estimated year-end numbers. Plug those numbers
into a 1040 as if completing a real tax return. Compare the estimated
tax owed with what already has been paid. If past payments and
withholding through the last few weeks of the year are sufficient,
keep the projection and records in a file to make next year's tax
season simpler.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have paid far too little can make an estimated tax
payment or have their employer withhold more from remaining
paychecks. The withholding option is better, Nissenbaum said, because
it eliminates underpayment penalties that still may be assessed if
you make an estimated payment with cash.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Buyer Vows to Trump Pebble Beach," Nov. 10: I am the person who
was on the landslide at Ocean Trails Golf Club in 1999. My dog and I
had to be airlifted to safety and are fortunate to be alive today. I
take exception to the statement that a leaking sewer line caused the
landslide that took out the 18th hole as well as a beautiful coastal
bluff and tide pools. After much study and finger-pointing, it was
never determined whether the sewer line was leaking prior to the
slide.</LD>
<LD>   Many factors were at work. In the months leading up to the
landslide, the entire area was scraped clean of its existing
vegetation. When the predicted El Nino rains fell, torrents of water
carved deep channels on their way to the sea. After bulldozers and
earthmovers had reconfigured the landscape, the 18th hole was
constructed on what the environmental impact report had identified as
an ancient landslide with, not surprisingly, the potential to slide.
Also, an artificial lake that was built nearby was found to have a
substandard liner, causing it to leak.</LD>
<TE>   The Palos Verdes Peninsula has notoriously unstable geology, and I
think that Donald Trump may be wise to rethink his idea of
reconfiguring an existing Ocean Trails golf hole so that it is
perched on the fringe of a bluff. Natural forces should be respected
and worked with rather than flouted and worked against, whether one
is a flamboyant developer or not.</TE>

<HD>Republicans Obstructed Clinton's Nominees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a Nov. 13 letter, Peter Rich stated, "The Democrats have already
been far more obstructionist with the Bush administration's judicial
nominees than Republicans were with President Clinton's." President
Bush's nominees have been confirmed by the Democrats at a
significantly faster rate than were Clinton's by the Republicans. In
all of 1996, the Republican-controlled Senate confirmed only 17 of
Clinton's judicial nominees, reportedly a 40-year low. Senate
Judiciary Committee Chair Orrin Hatch prevented a vote on the
appointment of Judge Richard Paez to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
for more than four years, despite the highest possible rating from
the American Bar Assn. for Paez. In 1997, federal court vacancies
reached 100 due to Hatch's refusal to allow the nominations to come
up for a vote.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans like to argue that the number of Clinton judicial
appointments confirmed were similar to the numbers achieved by
President Reagan -- 377 in eight years. What they don't say is that
the number reflects primarily the success during the years that
Clinton enjoyed a Democratically controlled Senate. The success rate
changed significantly under Republican Senate control.</LD>

<LD>Mike Feuer is correct about the housing problem in Los Angeles, but
he addressed only part of the problem in his Nov. 14 commentary,
"L.A. Trust Fund Is a Good Foundation for Affordable Housing." So
long as residents -- legal and illegal -- continue to propagate in an
unthinking fashion, housing will never catch up to population. A
$10-an-hour worker I met recently proudly told me that he has five
children. I am sorry if they live in a garage, but it is difficult
for me to work up much sympathy for their situation.</LD>

<HD>Norah Vincent Spins an Illogical GOP Rant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Bleating of the Cushioned Classes," Commentary, Nov. 14:
Norah Vincent's column is a disingenuous piece of Republican spin.
According to Vincent, if a person is "living the American dream," he
or she is hypocritical to care about the environment, civil rights or
the separation of church and state.</LD>
<LD>   There are obviously many rich Republican CEOs who are not
hypocritical; they have paid themselves lavish salaries while running
their companies into the ground, cheated and lied to their
shareholders and have asked for and received special treatment from
the government. Certainly they have nothing to fear from the results
of the last election.</LD>
<LD>   But I have much to fear: I believe that President Bush's policies
will run this country into the ground as sure as Bush's good friend
destroyed Enron. Campaign contributions will dictate his policies and
greed will rule.</LD>
<TE>   Elaine Fresco</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of middle-class voters who presume to voice distress at
the recent Republican sweep of Congress, Vincent writes: "An inverse
relationship seems to exist between how good this country has been to
certain people and the flimsiness of the pretexts on which they not
only disparage but also betray it -- in spirit and careless words, if
not in deeds."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, for middle-class voters to express anything other
than wholehearted approval of Republican policies amounts to treason
-- a sentiment that would seem to amply justify the middle-class
Democratic apprehensions she derides ("the specter of jackbooted
Republicans banging home their belligerent agenda in Congress
untrammeled by sensible dissent"). Thus ever conservatism: irate,
resentful and searching for enemies to denounce, even in victory.</TE>

<TE>   As an English instructor at Cal State Bakersfield, I regularly
read your Commentary page to show my students how to create a
logical, well-crafted, succinct argument. I also get to read Vincent,
whom I would like to personally thank. One of the hardest concepts
for my students to grasp is the notion of a fallacious claim.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, I can regularly turn to Vincent for examples of ad
hominem, poisoning the well and the genetic fallacy. Rather than
presenting her claims or logically critiquing those of her opponent,
Vincent -- choosing to ignore the argument itself -- consistently
attacks a claim's environment, whether that be the person making the
claim, the present circumstances surrounding the claim or the history
in which the claim was fashioned. Her commentaries never fail to
provide my students with examples of illogic at work.</TE>

<LD>Re "Parks Proposal Alarms Activists" and "Judge Drops Frog Habitat
Protections," Nov. 13: The Times logs yet another pair of
environmental safeguards being tossed out the window, courtesy of
President "Pave It All Over" Bush and his administration.
Snowmobilers can once again assault Yellowstone in winter, and
red-legged frogs are no longer protected from development and
all-terrain assault vehicles (and that industry) in California.</LD>
<LD>   The Muslim countries with which we are at odds refer to Bush as
the "Great Satan." When it concerns our environment, that moniker
fits the current U.S. president like a glove.</LD>

<TE>   During my time as a Yellowstone ranger, I met countless park
visitors, and most expected the park service to do everything in its
power to preserve the national heritage for future generations.
Sadly, Bush doesn't appear to share this desire. The president's plan
to scrap a Yellowstone snowmobile phaseout and replace it with
measures that "minimize" snowmobile damage is a prime example of his
reluctance to give the parks the full protection they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to the national parks, the American public has a
long memory. Teddy Roosevelt, for example, is still revered for his
work to block private forces from destroying our public lands and
waters. In recognition of his tireless commitment to conservation,
Roosevelt's face was chiseled into Mt. Rushmore. Similarly, Bush's
environmental policies will be long remembered. However, it seems
that a toxic landfill might be the only appropriate monument to the
president's environmental legacy.</TE>

<LD>Re "Look. Listen. Over There." editorial, Nov. 10:</LD>
<LD>   I was amused and entertained by your editorial on TV Quik-Speak,
which was at once timely and concise, correctly pointing out a
penchant by TV commentators to employ time-saving language in light
of our current cultural tendency to exhibit short attention spans,
necessitating the transfer of information in bursts and sound bites.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, I have noticed for a few years now an equally
annoying and grammatically questionable trend among journalists with
the Los Angeles Times, "one of the world's great newspapers," and
other popular print media to scribe meandering and excruciatingly
long sentences -- there is also a tendency to insert related phrases
or sentences within many sentences, set off by dashes -- containing
multiple subjects that could more clearly be presented in separate
sentences, resulting in a single sentence often consuming an entire
paragraph.</LD>
<TE>   Our media, whether electronic or print, have a responsibility to
exemplify good language skills. Thank you for pointing this out, but
you told only half the story. Somewhere there is reasonable middle
ground. Clear. Concise. Correct. Coherent. Complete. Freshman

<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't think the L.A. Board of Supervisors understands the severity
of the effect of closing Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation
Center on people with disabilities (Nov. 13). In many of the
independent living centers across California, there are consumers of
services who thank Rancho Los Amigos for their independent way of
living. Without Rancho Los Amigos they might be in a nursing home,
doubting their self-worth and letting their disability get the best
of them. But because of Rancho, many people with disabilities are
integrated into society as members of the community and the work
force.</LD>
<LD>   Rancho Los Amigos is more than a hospital. It's a landmark to
rehabilitation service to the disability community. It should not be
closed down.</LD>

<BD>Benjamin R. Barber, Distinguished University Professor
at the University of Maryland, is the author of "Jihad vs. McWorld."
He will be speaking at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on
Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Osama bin Laden, it appears, is back. Which means even after Iraq is
disarmed, which it will certainly be one way or another, Al Qaeda
will continue its campaign of destruction and terror. As the United
States impatiently waits for weapons inspections to fail so it can
open a second front in the war on terrorism, it has nowhere near
closed out the first front. The Taliban has been run out, but
Afghanistan is by no means stable. Pakistan has become a principal
U.S. ally, but tens of thousands of Wahabi fundamentalist religious
schools (madrasas) continue preparing the next generation of zealots
for their jihad.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when President Bush declared
that any state harboring terrorists would be a potential target of
U.S. military force, America has crafted anti-terrorist policies as
if we still lived in a 19th century world where the only enemies of
states were other states.</LD>
<TE>   But in the 21st century world of globalization and
interdependence, malevolent nongovernmental operations like Al Qaeda
and Hezbollah, hiding in the creases of the new global disorder, are
the real enemies. Destroying the regimes that harbor them will be
ineffective, because such states include not only a handful of
rogues, but also allies like Pakistan and Egypt, European friends
like Germany and Britain and even states within the continental U.S.
Remember, Florida and New Jersey inadvertently harbored terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   America has lived for two centuries with the myth of its
independence, sure that its sovereignty would protect it from outside
aggression. After all, before Sept. 11, the last major assault by
foreigners on mainland American soil was the British attack on the
White House and the Capitol in 1814. But our sovereign independence,
already under siege from new forms of global disease, global
technology, global crime, global ecology and global markets, came
under direct assault on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The moment has come for a new "declaration of interdependence"
that will embrace America's fully joining the world to which it is
ever more seamlessly bound. For interdependence means no nation,
however powerful, can impose its will on others. It means that as
long as a child in Cairo lives in poverty, no U.S. child can live in
safety. It means that the wealthiest nation cannot flourish unless
those in the most impoverished have opportunities to grow.</TE>
<TE>   War (or its threat) can take out a coterie of terrorists and bring
this or that rogue state to heel and thereby help eliminate that
malevolent interdependence that terrorism has both created and
exploited. But to construct a benevolent interdependence is another
matter: It entails strengthening international law, reinforcing
multilateralism and spreading equality.</TE>
<TE>   For these tasks, military might is not only ineffective but
sometimes counterproductive. It was no accident that after two
devastating world wars into which the United States was drawn,
America became the chief architect of an international framework for
law, cooperation and economic development. Its effort put the first
positive face on a benevolent interdependence that not only paid
tribute to America's best democratic instincts and altruistic
generosity but that also reflected its best interests.</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, as terrorism puts its exclamation point on the new age
where interdependence is more real than ever, is the Bush
administration insisting on a traditional sovereignty that it has
already lost and a unilateralist strategy of preventive war that
cannot succeed?</TE>
<TE>   Not only has it withdrawn from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty and turned its back on the international criminal court (an
ideal instrument to prosecute international terrorists), it has
weakened the monitoring provisions of the chemical weapons convention
and defunded programs aimed at dealing with the "loose nukes" left
behind by the breakup of the Soviet Union. It has insisted on
unilateralism and force in a world demanding more cooperation and
multitrack strategies that focus on education as well as arms, and on
economic opportunity no less than inspections compliance.</TE>
<TE>   The globalized world will remain a dangerous place for Americans
until ways are found either to democratize globalization or globalize
democracy. In a world defined by doctors without frontiers and banks
without borders, there must also be democracy without frontiers and
citizens without borders.</TE>
<TE>   To create such a world is the work of governments, as well as of
civil associations and the private sector, and it cannot be
accomplished by states alone or exclusively by force of arms. It
means finding ways to make not only smart bombs but smart kids; a
dollar spent on education today may save $100 on weapons 10 years
from now because a potential terrorist has become an educated
citizen. It means transnational NGOs, responsible multinational
companies and innovative forms of global governance. It means genuine
diversity -- not only our own familiar tolerance for religious
pluralism, but a tolerance for religion itself; not only religions
that are tolerant of secularism, but a secularist materialism that
reins itself in enough to be respectful of religion.</TE>
<TE>   At this moment in history, Islamic and Hindu parents in the Third
World (and some Christian parents in the First World) have two fears
about the future. The first is the fear that their children will be
left out of modernity, deprived of the opportunity to join the global
marketplace and share in its products and prosperity. The second is
that their children will be included in modernity, join the global
marketplace and, as a consequence, lose their religious roots and
cultural morals. They would be saved from poverty only to be plunged
into corruption.</TE>
<TE>   A civil and civilized world -- call it CivWorld -- must be one
where liberty is not secured at the price of equality and pluralism
does not demand the corruption of morals; where no nation, however
powerful, can force the world to join it unless it first acknowledges
it is part of the world; where strong nations are willing not only to
make war on terrorists but to share the sources of their strength
with the weak; and where warriors against the axis of evil are also
willing to become soldiers against the axis of inequality and tutors
to the axis of despair -- the invisible twins of the axis of evil.</TE>
<TE>   Killing Bin Laden and disarming Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
will mean little if, as we bring down the "evil ones," we fail to
raise up a democratic architecture of interdependence in its place.</TE>

<HD>Can Hahn Think Big?</HD>
<DH>In ousting Chief Parks and tackling secession, the mayor
took risks. Now will he slide back into pothole politics?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Boyarsky</AU>
<BD>Bill Boyarsky is senior consultant for the Center for
Governmental Studies and teaches journalism at the USC Annenberg
School for Communications. He is writing a biography of the late
California political leader Jesse M. Unruh.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was Mayor James K. Hahn's moment of triumph the day after
secession's defeat. Arrayed behind him on the platform at the Airtel
Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys were some of the city's biggest powers, among
them schools Supt. Roy Romer and new Police Chief William J. Bratton.
But as Hahn approached the peroration of his celebratory speech, the
audience didn't hear about his vision for the city he had fought to
keep whole.</LD>
<LD>   "I ask you, Kim Thompson, and you, Al Fuong, to join me in working
to close the Sunshine Canyon Landfill in your backyard," said the
mayor, naming two people seated behind him. "I ask you, Jim Dunn, to
join me in making L.A. a better city in which to do business." And on
he went, naming names.</LD>
<LD>   Listening to Hahn, I was reminded of the small San Francisco Bay
Area city where I went to school and later worked as a reporter for
the Oakland Tribune. San Leandro was the kind of place where
decisions were made by a few men in the coffee shop across from City
Hall, discussing which streets to fix and nailing down the details of
the Fourth of July parade. Hahn, chief executive of the nation's
second-largest city, sounded like the mayor of San Leandro.</LD>
<TE>   Could this be the "new" Hahn, who had defied expectations and
boldly risked his core black supporters by dumping Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks because he felt the chief not only opposed police
reform but also insisted on lecturing the mayor on the subject rather
than listening to him? Could this be the "new" Hahn who had
single-mindedly raised huge amounts of money to beat secession and
campaigned against it by invoking an image of a greater L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   Or, with the secession threat neutralized, had the "old" Hahn, who
finds comfort in the small and mundane, just as he has done
throughout most of his career, resurfaced?</TE>
<TE>   His father, the late Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn,
was the master of pothole politics, first-name friend of every
businessperson and neighborhood big shot in his working-class
South-Central district, and relentless provider of parks, libraries,
swimming pools and well-maintained streets and sidewalks. Although he
was a risk taker -- he conceived the sales tax increase that began
the county's rail transit system -- Supervisor Hahn never let on that
he was the smartest, craftiest and toughest of politicians. His was
the safe political path.</TE>
<TE>   The son, first as city attorney and then in his early days as
mayor, also favored a safe, almost passive, approach. What's more,
unlike his publicity-loving dad, he recoiled from the public
spotlight -- except when he was in trouble. In two races for city
attorney, Hahn the younger, faced with tough challenges, turned into
a political killer, just as he did when he beat Antonio Villaraigosa
for mayor in 2001, when he fired Parks and when he defeated
secession.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview in his City Hall office after his celebratory
speech, the mayor didn't deny his small-town approach to governance,
what his political advisor, Bill Wardlaw, calls putting a face on
city government. Hahn embraced it, saying it was the way for the city
and for him to succeed after the trauma of the secession fight. "I've
got to be the mayor of Atwater Village and Arleta and the mayor of
Westchester and Winnetka," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "People want specifics these days," Hahn continued. "They are
looking past the idea that someone is going to give an eloquent,
feel-good speech."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Hahn said he understood that he also had to deal with the big
picture, but, "I'll tell you, if you have to choose, if one thing has
to give, I think you have to concentrate on those little things.
Taxpayers want to see the tax dollars at work in our neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   With that simple -- or simplistic -- formula, Hahn aims to make
peace with the 50.7% of the Valley that voted for secession and still
retain the support of the downtown-oriented public employee unions
and businesses that bankrolled his fight against secession. Clean,
smooth streets, he hopes, will help dissipate the unhappiness many
black leaders still feel over his firing of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Such a goal didn't seem improbable the Wednesday morning after the
election, when the roomful of old supporters and new toadies cheered
him and hustled to shake his hand. L.A. loves a winner. But the
immensity of the task ahead was much clearer the night before at a
pro-secession party at another San Fernando Valley hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The music was minimal. The decorations were spare. The returns,
even at the early hour, didn't look favorable. But in addition to the
good feelings generated by the pay bars, there seemed to be a real
spirit, much of it coming from campaigners for candidates for seats
on the proposed Valley city council. These people -- many new to the
game -- had gotten a taste of political participation and, with
leadership, could stick with it.</TE>
<TE>   A few were cynical about how the San Fernando Valley has been
inundated with city street fixers and traffic managers during City
Hall's campaign against secession. "I think if they stop the traffic
guys, the Valley will be outraged," said one council candidate, Scott
Svonkin.</TE>
<TE>   It's safe to assume, given Hahn's formula for political
conversion, that the traffic-minders will remain on duty,
supplemented by more left-turn lanes and the latest in stoplight
technology. Services, however, were just one aspect of the secession
drive. More powerful was the demand for decentralization of political
power. That is a perennial Valley issue that won't go away.</TE>
<TE>   "Can that structure on Spring Street change and share power with
the neighborhoods?" asked secession leader Richard Katz. The vote, he
said, "was a wake-up call that business as usual will not satisfy"
the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   In the interview in his mayoral office, Hahn said he recognized
the need for neighborhood representation. He's betting on
neighborhood councils, authorized by a revision of the Los Angeles
City Charter two years ago, as well as homeowner organizations,
business owners and various community groups that have a stake in a
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The councils will advise city government but have no lawmaking
power. They can protest a controversial development but can't stop
it. Nor do they have authority over the city budget. That is why
Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) proposed earlier in the
year a borough system that would make the various parts of the city
largely self-governing in many municipal matters. The Hertzberg plan,
which fell flat in City Hall, was supported by a number of Valley
leaders, who also favor giving the neighborhood councils real power
or enlarging the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn disagrees about the need for boroughs, although he did
announce last week a plan for reorganizing most city departments so
that each one breaks the city down into the same seven regions. Each
region will have its own "neighborhood city hall" out of which
employees of most city departments will work. But the regions don't
correspond to boundary lines of any council or neighborhood council
districts, and no new elected officials will represent them.</TE>
<TE>   "We are just in the infancy of neighborhood councils," Hahn said.
"Many of them are weeks old. They are just learning to walk now. I
would like to see how [they] develop ... before saying we have to
have boroughs, we have to have more City Council members, we need to
do this, we need to do that. I'd like to see how we're doing with
this structure and try to get people to buy into it."</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Joel Fox, a secessionist advisor, said that
unless that happened, people would see the councils "as a bowl of
jelly" and Hahn would fail.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood councils are just part of how Hahn will be
judged. For example, owners of small and medium-sized businesses --
the heart and soul of the pro-secessionist Valley Industrial and
Commercial Assn. -- want the city tax on gross business receipts
reduced; the levy is a complex mess of categories. But that potential
loss of city revenue clashes with the salary-and-benefit goals of the
municipal employee unions so helpful to Hahn in the anti-secession
fight.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn realizes his fierce campaign against secession made people
mad. "At the end of the day, I am going to have to mend fences with a
lot of people," he said. "I think that's already begun.... I don't
know if people will elect me to a second term as mayor or not. But I
know I'm here now, and I worked really hard to get here. So, every
time there's a decision on your plate, you're going to do what you
think is right. I may not get this chance again."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's words seem to show that Hahn understands the
difficulties that lie ahead. Certainly, he rose to the occasion with
Parks and secession. The question is: Can he sustain this toughness,
or will he bury himself in small, safe tasks? L.A. is not a small
town. It is a complex, contentious place, where race relations are
volatile and the gap between rich and poor is widening. To govern it
effectively will require more than filling potholes.</TE>

<HD>McTrouble in Fat Land</HD>
<DH>Pressured on the financial and health fronts, McDonald's
must revisit the fundamentals that gave rise to its success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Critser</AU>
<BD>Greg Critser, a frequent contributor to Opinion, is the
author of "Fat Land: How Americans Became the Fattest People in the
World," to be published by Houghton Mifflin in January.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blame Max Cooper. He is the former McDonald's Corp. executive and
current franchisee who came up with the notion of a "value meal."
Cooper, who in the mid-1970s began a wildcat experiment with the
concept at his own stores, knew it was the next big thing. But he had
trouble convincing other McDonald's executives.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, the moaning and groaning," he recalls. "All they could hear
was that somehow I was advocating 'discounting,' which to them meant
somehow devaluing the brand. But that wasn't what I was talking about
at all. I was always talking about somehow replicating the notion of
the table d'hote, as I had experienced it as a young man in Paris."</LD>
<LD>   As anyone who has ever hoisted a Big Mac knows, McDonald's
headquarters got only one part of Cooper's message -- and it wasn't
the idea of bringing a French sensibility to fast food. What they
grasped is that bargain meals, a.k.a. value meals, sell burgers. And
as anyone who owns stock in the company knows, value meals (which
soon morphed into the health nightmare known as supersizing)
translated into higher stock values. That was because value meals did
exactly what Cooper thought they would do: increase foot traffic and
overall purchasing. In the long run they helped transform McDonald's
into the most recognizable brand in the modern global food industry.</LD>
<TE>   But recent trends -- seven quarters of declining earnings, this
month's stock price slide, a revolt by 500 franchisees, layoffs
overseas and at home, and a growing worldwide protest over the
company's omnipresent and nutritionally troubling food -- point to an
uncomfortable fact for CEO Jack Greenberg, who just last year was
portrayed on the cover of Foreign Affairs as a virtual Atlas. It is
this: McDonald's must fundamentally remake itself if it is to
survive. And to do so, it must address the concerns of many of its
biggest critics, and then boldly go even further.</TE>
<TE>   Tinkering with the present formula -- as the company has
unsuccessfully tried with its recent "Big 'N Tasty" campaign -- won't
work. In almost every domain, McDonald's must revisit the
fundamentals that gave rise to its success.</TE>
<TE>   Consider supersizing. With obesity rates skyrocketing and
government health policy increasingly attuned to the caloric
imbalances that cause it, jumbo burgers and jumbo fries simply don't
look so cool anymore. Worse, the concern is growing in lucrative
overseas markets. Earlier this year, a major contretemps between
McDonald's USA and McDonald's France erupted when the latter placed
ads in popular women's magazines advocating that, for their health,
customers should limit their consumption of fast food. (The
collective "mon Dieu!" could be heard from Chicago to Paris.)</TE>
<TE>   The fundamental notion -- more for less -- has turned out to be a
bad idea for sedentary modern societies. So has the use of cheap but
outdated ingredients. The commodity revolution of the early 1980s,
which produced huge surpluses of cheap meats, fats and sugars, is
increasingly besieged by bad economies. There are also more and more
troubling studies implicating McDonald's core menu items in the
development of chronic diseases, from dental caries (from the
high-fructose corn syrup) to obesity (from the high saturated-fat
content) to type 2 diabetes (from both).</TE>
<TE>   Again, the fundamental notion -- McDonald's as the overlord of
Midwestern commodity imperialism -- has turned out to have some
troubling limitations.</TE>
<TE>   "Omnipresence" -- the notion that McDonald's could always outstrip
its competitors through sheer physical growth, opening 1,000 new
stores a year -- has not only proved costly and self-cannibalizing,
it has made the firm a pariah among powerful new urban interest
groups. For 20 years the company's franchisees have successfully used
taxpayer-supported Small Business Administration loan guarantees to
create a new urban nutritional infrastructure targeting young
minority males. No wonder communities are questioning the need for a
McDonald's on every corner.</TE>
<TE>   No one, of course, is writing obituaries for McAtlas. Yet. But
considering the wrath and number of its critics and the
aggressiveness of its competitors, McDonald's clearly needs to take
some chances. That it can afford to do so is demonstrated by its
recent decision to re-engineer its cooking oils to contain fewer
unhealthful trans fats -- an admission, long coming, that its fries
were unnecessarily unhealthful.</TE>
<TE>   But that was too timid. In the arena of fats and oils, McDonald's
needs to join the global 21st century, where much healthier oils are
now available, particularly olive oil, which has become a cheap
commodity with tons of urban cachet. It should find a way to use this
new and very adaptable oil for deep frying.</TE>
<TE>   It must also take the leap into what nutritional policymakers from
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson on down
have begun to describe as "smart-sizing." This means making it
possible to buy an eight-ounce Coke, now impossible at any of its
stores. It also means using its sizable advertising muscle to make
smaller portions sexier. One imagines a "Le Petit Mac," made with
better ingredients and hawked by, say, Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   It might also revisit Max Cooper's original vision of a table
d'hote, which would go a long way toward reestablishing a group
dining culture in an increasingly fragmented food culture. By this I
do not mean that McDonald's must bear the weight of the kind of
social re-engineering that should come from the ground up, but rather
that it find ways to make money doing so. How about rewarding family
dining with a reduced-rate bowl of salad for the entire table?</TE>
<TE>   A story that every now and then makes the rounds at McDonald's is
particularly relevant here. In the early 1970s, chain founder Ray
Kroc was engaged in a vigorous debate with David Wallerstein, one of
his top executives, over the introduction of large bags of fries.
"Let them just buy two bags if they want more," was Kroc's standard
reply to Wallerstein.</TE>
<TE>   But people were not buying two bags. So Wallerstein began slipping
out at various times of the day and watching people order fries at
several McDonald's locations. He compiled an informal study and came
rushing back with his results. "Ray, people want more! But they don't
order two bags because they don't want to be seen as gluttonous!"
Kroc, convinced of the logic, approved the new product, now known
round the world.</TE>
<TE>   Did someone say it's time for the folks at McDonald's to start
getting out more often?</TE>

<AU>Laura K. Donohue</AU>
<BD>Laura K. Donohue, an acting assistant professor of
political science at Stanford University, is a Carnegie Scholar and a
visiting fellow at the Center for International Security and
Cooperation at Stanford's Institute for International Studies.</BD>
<DL>STANFORD</DL>
<LD>Early this month, six men driving in Marib province, Yemen, died when
a CIA drone fired a Hellfire missile into their car. Bush
administration officials say that one of the men was Qaed Sinan
Harithi, suspected of involvement in the October 2000 bombing of the
destroyer Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. The White House
described the other five men as low-level operatives in Al Qaeda. One
of them, it turns out, was a U.S. citizen.</LD>
<LD>   The incident in Yemen wasn't the first time in the war on
terrorism that the Bush administration has assassinated people it
considers "enemy combatants." But it is the first time it has done so
outside Afghanistan; it is the first time it has done so in a country
with which the U.S. is not at war; and it is the first time it has
assassinated a U.S. citizen.</LD>
<LD>   This signals a dangerous and unethical shift in U.S. policy and
underscores the hypocrisy of the administration's stance on
democratic norms. It also undermines Americans' safety both at home
and abroad.</LD>
<TE>   The target was clearly Harithi, a man Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld referred to after the killing as "a suspected terrorist
connected to the USS Cole." He was suspected of terrorist crimes, but
he had not been charged -- much less convicted -- in any court of
law. Neither had the other five, at least one of whom was entitled to
U.S. constitutional protections.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after Sept. 11, 2001, Congress passed a joint
resolution authorizing President Bush "to use all necessary and
appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he
determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist
attacks." The resolution failed to place adequate safeguards on the
power granted to the president. The Bush administration subsequently
held hundreds of people indefinitely, without charge.</TE>
<TE>   The White House refused to apply the Geneva conventions to
prisoners and replaced the U.S. judicial system with military
tribunals, claiming that due process did not apply to suspected
terrorists. Now, the administration appears to be interpreting the
resolution as a license to kill.</TE>
<TE>   In October 2001, the Bush administration issued a presidential
finding that grants the CIA power to engage in "lethal covert
operations" to eliminate Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   On the surface, this violates Executive Order 12333, put into
place by President Gerald R. Ford and renewed by Presidents Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan. The order states unequivocally: "No
employee of the U.S. government shall engage in, or conspire to
engage in, assassination." The White House claims that the order
doesn't apply to wartime or to individuals with the newly minted
enemy-combatant status, just as it didn't apply to enemy soldiers
killed in previous wars.</TE>
<TE>   But we aren't at war with Yemen. We are at war with a method,
which is something much more amorphous. Reeling from the Sept. 11
attacks, Congress gave the Bush administration the power to determine
who is a terrorist and to go after him anywhere in the world. The
administration claims that Article 51 of the United Nations Charter,
which allows for self-defense, further justifies its position. The
intent of Article 51, however, was to repel an immediate threat or
direct invasion. It would be hard to prove that six men traveling in
a car in Yemen represent an imminent threat to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   How can America claim to be a great protector of human rights and
engage in extrajudicial assassinations? On Nov. 4, the day after the
assassination, President Bush denounced Al Qaeda as "international
killers." A State Department spokesman then announced, "Our policy on
targeted killings in the Israeli-Palestinian context has not
changed." The United States cannot live by the standards it condemns.</TE>
<TE>   The assassination raises important moral questions. Is it better
for one, or, in this case, six enemy combatants to die, their guilt
unproved, than for American soldiers' or citizens' lives to be placed
at risk? The utilitarian argument that might allow this ignores the
central importance of individual rights -- rights that form the basis
of our political structure.</TE>
<TE>   If we suppose that we are at war, then the tradition of "just war"
demands that the force we employ must be "discriminate," providing
immunity for innocents wherever possible. And it must be proportional
to our ends. Some might argue that assassination is discriminate,
since the target is specific, and that this sets it apart from
terrorism, which is "indiscriminate murder." But this argument
depends upon what is considered a "legitimate" target -- a definition
set by those engaging in the act itself. In terms of proportionality,
was the murder of six people proportional to the suspicion of the
guilt of one?</TE>
<TE>   Assassination does not ensure national security; it erodes it. It
sets a precedent for other countries to engage in similar practices,
endangering U.S. citizens at home and abroad. It also alienates our
closest friends when we need them the most and hurts us in the
recruitment of other important allies. A Gallup Poll of 10,000 people
in nine Islamic countries in December 2001 and January 2002 showed
that the populations view the United States as "ruthless, aggressive,
conceited, arrogant, easily provoked and biased on foreign policy."
Only 9% viewed U.S. military actions in Afghanistan as morally
justified, while 88% did not feel that the United States or the West
respected Arab or Islamic values. The way to counter this growing
anger and resentment is not to run roughshod over countries'
sovereignty, killing people at will.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, R. James Woolsey, the director of the CIA, testified on
the problems with state-sponsored assassinations: "In my view ... [a]
proposal that the United States should adopt political murder as a
tool of statecraft is impractical, ineffective, illegal and immoral."
More recently, U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) introduced the Terrorist
Elimination Act of 2001, which would have lifted the ban on
assassinations. Congress rejected his bill, which attracted no
co-sponsors and never made it onto a committee agenda.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that in its eagerness to respond to Sept. 11,
Congress went too far and allowed the Bush administration too much
leeway. The United States cannot insist that everyone else in the
sandbox play by democratic norms and then turn the tables by
establishing a separate set of rules for itself. It is not just
irresponsible. It is dangerous.</TE>

<BD>Marc B. Haefele comments on local and state issues for
KPCC-FM (89.3) in Pasadena.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To hard-core environmentalists, it was as though John Muir had
suggested clear-cutting Sequoia National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   "We have confidence that, given past history, the auto industry
will rise to the challenge and we will have light-duty diesel in
California." This was Alan Lloyd, longtime electric-car champion and
president of the California Air Resources Board, recently declaring
in a newspaper that diesel-powered cars, sport utility vehicles and
light trucks will become part of the solution, not the problem, in
California's effort to clean the air.</LD>
<LD>   Behind his heresy is the need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions
under the state's global-warming abatement law. Lloyd said he was
impressed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's test results
on the European-marketed Toyota Avensis, a diesel passenger car, and
the success of diesels in Europe. He also said that he had been
pushed by Gov. Gray Davis, who may want to avoid another legal
challenge by motor industry lawyers like those who recently won a
rollback of the Air Resources Board's electric-car mandate.</LD>
<TE>   Jerry Martin, an Air Resources Board spokesman, said Lloyd's
statement "wasn't anything really new. We've never ruled out any
technology that could give us cleaner air." But what did appear new
was the board chief's claim that long-reviled diesel was the
technology that could do it.</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd and his board have led the nation in fighting for a
reduction of diesel emissions. Major studies by USC, UCLA and other
top institutions have connected diesel particulate emissions with
respiratory ailments among children and adults in neighborhoods
adjacent to crowded freeways, making diesel pollution an
environmental-justice issue. And it's one reason why the federal EPA,
within five years, will require -- via innovative technology and
low-sulfur fuels -- that new diesels be 97% cleaner than those of
today.</TE>
<TE>   So strong has the air board's anti-diesel sentiment been that some
clean-air advocates wonder what's with Lloyd. According to one
skeptical environmentalist, "Increasing the use of diesel to clean up
the air is like taking up smoking to lose weight." Or, as automotive
historian David Kirsch puts it, "You can have cleaner diesel. But
there's no such thing as clean diesel." Even the European-market
diesels Lloyd cited as examples of how good diesels can be do not
meet the impending EPA rules.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the fact is, most diesels pump out less carbon-dioxide
greenhouse gas than gasoline engines of the same power range, leading
some to wonder whether the air board might be inclined to seek more
greenhouse reduction in return for an increase of other diesel
pollutants.</TE>
<TE>   But Lloyd has vowed to make no compromise in emission standards
while seeking the diesel-power option, particularly in popular (if
CO2-prone) SUVs, as well as light trucks and cars. It's not yet clear
exactly how that can be done, though. Carbon dioxide, the basic
combustion byproduct, causes global warming. The less fuel an engine
burns, the less CO2 it pumps out. State law requires auto makers to
reduce CO2 emissions by 2009, and Lloyd says the greater use of
diesel could make this happen.</TE>
<TE>   But diesels also emit nitrogen oxide (NOx) gases and sooty flakes
called particulate matter. The former make smog; the latter are a
factor in respiratory disease. And the particle traps and NOx
catalysts needed to meet the 2007-10 federal clean-air deadlines are
still in development and of uncertain durability. What's more, most
of these devices are intended for 18-wheeler trucks, not cars. Nor
even the bulky, best-selling CO2-belching SUVs the new law appears to
target.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dead end," said Dan Lashof of the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington. "We're all for any technology that
makes for cleaner air," he added, but he said other technologies --
particularly gas-electric hybrid cars like Toyota's Prius, which has
sold 100,000 worldwide -- offer both low CO2 and low emissions of
other pollutants, plus mileage as good as a diesel. Other engineering
innovations can both lower conventional gas-engine cars' CO2
emissions and raise mileage to diesel levels, according to veteran
auto engineer and consultant Vahe Kludjian. These include
high-voltage electric systems that would power what are now
engine-driven accessories, as well as direct fuel-injection systems.</TE>
<TE>   Diesels make up 30% of the European car market, and overseas
manufacturers are developing the technology to the max: One Opel-Fiat
two-seater diesel show car reportedly gets 94 miles per gallon.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. skeptics like Kludjian and Lashof say that diesels cost
more than equivalent gas-engine cars, and their greatest appeal is
that diesel fuel is about 25% cheaper than regular gas in Europe. (In
California, diesel often costs more than regular.) What's more, it
has been a long time since mileage was a strong selling point to
Americans, who may still be averse to going diesel because of the
foul reputation that U.S.-built diesel cars acquired in the late
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, Euro-diesels don't have the high-tech add-ons needed to
meet coming federal EPA and California regulations -- and it's
uncertain how well they would run if they did.</TE>
<TE>   The official EPA/Society of Automotive Engineers test report said
that the Avensis, when burning an ultra-low-sulfur fuel not available
commercially, met EPA's intermediate 2004 diesel-emission
requirements. But it added that the test was too brief to confirm the
durability of the car's innovative duplex pollution-control system.
Toyota spokeswoman Holly Ferris said: "That vehicle has nothing to do
with the North American market."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Toyota has a much stronger clean-air commitment to
its Prius and other hybrids, including a full-size sedan now marketed
in Japan. Nissan, Toyota's major competitor, has also announced a
hybrid program. Manufacturers and environmentalists mostly agree that
this looks like the way to go. As Lashof put it, "Because of the
hybrid's electric component, it's the link to the fuel-cell future of
the automobile."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd's dark-horse diesel choice could be the loser in this
critical race for clean air.</TE>

biology at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a new term in the environmental movement. It sounds
esoteric, like the kind of thing you don't really need to understand,
something you can leave to the more technical types.</LD>
<LD>   The term is "shifting baselines," and you do need to know it,
because shifting baselines affect the quality-of-life decisions you
face daily. Shifting baselines are the chronic, slow, hard-to-notice
changes in things, from the disappearance of birds and frogs in the
countryside to the increased drive time from L.A. to San Diego. If
your ideal weight used to be 150 pounds and now it's 160, your
baseline -- as well as your waistline -- has shifted.</LD>
<LD>   The term was coined by fisheries biologist Daniel Pauly in 1995.
It was a term we'd apparently been needing, because it quickly spread
to a variety of disciplines. It's been applied to analysis of
everything from deteriorating cities to declining quality of
entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   Among environmentalists, a baseline is an important reference
point for measuring the health of ecosystems. It provides information
against which to evaluate change. It's how things used to be. It is
the tall grass prairies filled with buffalo, the swamps of Florida
teeming with bird life and the rivers of the Northwest packed with
salmon. In an ideal world, the baseline for any given habitat would
be what was there before humans had much impact.</TE>
<TE>   If we know the baseline for a degraded ecosystem, we can work to
restore it. But if the baseline shifted before we really had a chance
to chart it, then we can end up accepting a degraded state as normal
-- or even as an improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The number of salmon in the Pacific Northwest's Columbia River
today is twice what it was in the 1930s. That sounds great -- if the
1930s are your baseline. But salmon in the Columbia River in the
1930s were only 10% of what they were in the 1800s. The 1930s numbers
reflect a baseline that had already shifted.</TE>
<TE>   This is what most environmental groups are now struggling with.
They are trying to decide: What do we want nature to look like in the
future? And more important: What did nature look like in the past?</TE>
<TE>   These questions are particularly important to ask about oceans, my
main research interest. Last year Jeremy Jackson of the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography brought the problem into focus with a
cover article in Science that was chosen by Discover magazine as the
most important discovery of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and his 18 co-authors pulled together data from around the
world to make the case that overfishing had been the most important
alteration to the oceans over the past millennium. Furthermore,
humans have had such a strong effect on the oceans for so long that,
in many locations, it is difficult to even imagine how full of life
the oceans used to be.</TE>
<TE>   One of scientists' biggest concerns is that the baselines have
shifted for many ocean ecosystems. What this means is that people are
now visiting degraded coastal environments and calling them
beautiful, unaware of how they used to look.</TE>
<TE>   People go diving today in California kelp beds that are devoid of
the large black sea bass, broomtailed groupers and sheephead that
used to fill them. And they surface with big smiles on their faces
because it is still a visually stunning experience to dive in a kelp
bed. But all the veterans can think is, "You should have seen it in
the old days."</TE>
<TE>   Without the old-timers' knowledge, it's easy for each new
generation to accept baselines that have shifted and make peace with
empty kelp beds and coral reefs. Which is why it's so important to
document how things are -- and how they used to be.</TE>
<TE>   For the oceans, there is disagreement on what the future holds.
Some marine biologists argue that, as the desirable species are
stripped out, we will be left with the hardiest, most undesirable
species -- most likely jellyfish and bacteria, in effect the rats and
roaches of the sea. They point to the world's most degraded coastal
ecosystems -- places like the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, even parts
of the Chesapeake Bay. That's about all you find: jellyfish and
bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   We have already become comfortable with a new term, "jellyfish
blooms," which is used to describe sudden upticks in the number of
jellyfish in an area. The phenomenon has become sufficiently common
that an international symposium was held on the subject in 2000.
Meanwhile, other types of world fisheries are in steep decline.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to miss changes in the ocean. It's big and deep. But
sometimes, if people have studied the same oceanic trends over time,
we get a glimpse of a highly disturbing picture. The Scripps
Institution's Jackson, for example, has documented the nearly
complete disappearance of the ecosystem he built his career studying:
the coral reefs of Jamaica. "Virtually nothing remains of the
vibrant, diverse coral reef communities I helped describe in the
1970s," Jackson says. "Between overfishing, coastal development and
coral bleaching, the ecosystem has been degraded into mounds of dead
corals covered by algae in murky water." Nothing you would want to
make into a postcard.</TE>
<TE>   Next year two major reports will be released on the state of the
oceans: the Oceans Report from the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the
report of the U.S. Oceans Commission. The advance word on both is
that the news will not be good.</TE>
<TE>   The last major U.S. report on the oceans was 30 years ago. That
report warned that "there may be a risk some day of severely
declining oceans." The inside word on the upcoming reports is that
they will conclude that the oceans are today in severe decline.</TE>
<TE>   The Ocean Conservancy, Scripps Institution and the Surfrider
Foundation are mounting a major media campaign for early next year to
call attention to the overall fate of the oceans and the problem of
shifting baselines. The solutions are already known: We must care
more about the environment and work to prevent its decline. Hundreds
of environmental groups have action plans to help achieve such goals.
The only thing they are lacking is mass support.</TE>
<TE>   The oceans are our collective responsibility. We all have to ask
the questions: What did they used to look like? What are we putting
into them? Where did these fish we are eating come from? Are my food
preferences jeopardizing the health of the oceans?</TE>
<TE>   And, in a more philosophical vein, we should consider the shifting
baselines in our own lives, examining how and where have we lowered
our standards to the point that we accept things that once would have
been unacceptable. Our environment has clearly suffered from our
increasing comfort with shifting baselines. I suspect our lives have
suffered in other ways as well.</TE>

Education and Why It Matters."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We don't watch "The West Wing" anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, my family does. We tape it every Wednesday night to
preserve the rule of no television on school nights, and then we
watch it, together, on the weekend. Early in the first season, our
pre-teen daughter announced that she wanted to be C.J., the press
secretary, when she grew up. My husband and I, two yellow-dog
Democrats from the Midwest, plan to dwell in the blue-gray, 32-inch
glow of Bartlet-land, with all its liberal angst, until the real
world offers us something better.</LD>
<LD>   But lots of you have forsaken the show. Despite "The West Wing's"
Emmy-winning third season, viewers have turned away in droves from
the early episodes of the fourth season. Too dry, too serious, too
much policy wonking, too little Rob Lowe; every armchair expert has
an explanation.</LD>
<TE>   Truth is, you simply would rather watch something else; our
television sets have become the real weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   A nuclear warhead on the White House grounds was joke fodder on
"The West Wing," but a terrorist bomb in Los Angeles is the spine of
this season's "24," which, by the way, is up about 5 million viewers
over last year.</TE>
<TE>   You can find a "C.S.I." or "Law &amp; Order" clone almost every night,
duking it out with magazine shows about real crimes and docudramas
based on real crimes. What gets ratings is assault, as gruesome as
possible, either individual or global. Viewers want to see the
beautiful corpse sprawled at the curb, or to consider the possibility
that terrorists will forever retire the issue of traffic congestion
on the soon-to-be- vaporized 405.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Because at this uncertain moment in our nation's history, we
are desperate to hear about people who are worse off than we are.
Psychologists who deal with chronically ill patients talk about the
tendency to make "downward comparisons": The newly diagnosed feel
much better if they see another patient whose story is even sadder,
someone who is younger, poorer, more gravely ill. There is hope as
long as they do not feel that they are at the bottom of the heap.</TE>
<TE>   We are in sore need of hope these days. We wake up every morning
scared: There is so much to be afraid of, and worse, it is random.
Snipers pick off targets they have never met, with not so much as a
vendetta to ease the fear that any one of us could be next. The
government warns us, variously, to stay away from bridges or trains
or maybe tall buildings, except that we do not know which ones or
when. The remedies are no more consistent than the threats: A friend
with a little nail clipper got through airport security in Los
Angeles, but a second one she bought in San Francisco was confiscated
when she flew back home. This is supposed to make us feel secure.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not even contemplate the economy, which has decimated the
retirement savings of a generation and failed to provide jobs to
cushion the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Medical science? Be afraid; be very afraid. My favorite goof at
the moment is hormone replacement therapy, which my mother's
generation took to ward off all manner of ills, which my generation
may well abandon because -- oops -- we seem to have gotten it
backward, and those little pills are more likely to cause harm than
to prevent it. New research suggests that estrogen combats
Alzheimer's disease, which offers cold comfort: If we rush to refill
our prescriptions, we'll be less likely to forget all the other
threats the pills pose.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the environment. I live about a mile from the
Pacific Ocean, at least for the moment. If the oceans keep rising,
thanks to global warming, we could end up with a beachfront property
before the mortgage runs out. Or consider the new American Express
billboard that asks, coyly, "Is there anything plastic can't do?" Not
a darn thing. It's so powerful it may alter the hormonal makeup of
our kids, as they eat their lunches from it, drink their water from
it and sit on chairs made of it.</TE>
<TE>   So we turn on the tube and look for folks with real trouble:
people who have been relieved of their life savings, their homes,
their pulse; people who no longer have to worry about terrorists or
the stock market or their health because they will be dead or
convicted before we go to commercial. Compared with them, we seem
almost well off.</TE>
<TE>   It's a relief to contemplate poor Jack, who labors to save
everyone else on "24" from the pending nuclear apocalypse without
even knowing that his daughter, Kim, works for a madman. It's a
relief to watch the procedurals, knowing that justice will be served
at the end of an hour -- and that even when the cops or the lawyers
nail the wrong suspect, we, the viewers, know who really did it. How
lovely to feel omnipotent, even if it only lasts until we turn off
the set.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with the real world is that we never know how it is
going to turn out, but the problem with television is that we almost
always do. Is there anyone out there who really thinks that Jack will
let us be blown to smithereens? How can there be a third season if
we're pulverized? The suspense on "24" is not whether he's going to
save us, but how, and that makes for a nice, smug evening.</TE>
<TE>   "The West Wing" is escapism too, but with a point of view. There's
a much higher ratio of words to dead bodies; if "ripped from the
headlines" is the aesthetic these days, "The West Wing" borrows from
a different section of the paper than the crime shows do. This is not
make-a-snack television, where you can wander out to the kitchen and
come back to see whether they've found the perp yet. Sometimes we
have to use the commercial breaks to explain the policy issues to our
daughter; OK, sometimes we use them to explain the issues to each
other, depending on the topic. Any way you look at it, we are
talking, not vegging.</TE>
<TE>   We still miss Simon, the federal agent, because he was so much
more than just another corpse. When the president's late secretary,
Mrs. Landingham, reappeared in a flashback, we were glad to see her
again. Each of them died in a freak incident, with no hope of a tidy
ending. That's how it goes, doesn't it, outside the box.</TE>
<TE>   The latest "Bachelor" sweepstakes nibbles at "The West Wing's"
ratings, which troubles me more than it should.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand why people don't watch it anymore," I mutter
one morning, to myself as much as anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's too real," says the girl who would be C.J.</TE>
<TE>   And real, these days, is what we want to get away from.</TE>

<AU>Milton Viorst</AU>
<BD>Milton Viorst's latest book is "What Shall I Do With
This People? Jews and the Fractious Politics of Judaism."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, it's true that Israel is a parliamentary democracy, and yes,
it's true that Israelis overwhelmingly favor a peace settlement based
on the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
Notwithstanding Islamic extremists, suicide bombers and Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, the country's pollsters found last
month that 60% of Israelis wanted to reopen negotiations with the
Palestinians, and no fewer than 78% were ready to withdraw from
occupied territory in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. These numbers
correspond with poll results over the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   So, why has there been no peace, much less territorial withdrawal?
And why was Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's coalition, composed of
doves from the opposition Labor Party as well as representatives of
his right-wing Likud, recently replaced by an extremist Cabinet that
repudiates not just negotiations but past efforts at a compromise
peace?</LD>
<LD>   The answer lies in a combination of weak leadership in the Labor
Party, clumsy negotiating by the Palestinians, Washington's
abandonment of its role as mediator, the calculations of ambitious
politicians and the lacerating effect of terrorism on Israel's
collective psyche. But there is also something deeper and more
unyielding: the fragmentation of European Jewish unity two centuries
ago that gave rise to the divergent political shards blocking peace
today.</LD>
<TE>   To understand how this happened, it's important to recall that,
after their dispersion into a hostile world in the 1st century, Jews
adopted a defensive posture, preserving their identity by clustering
around their rabbis in closed communities known to history as
ghettos. This was the life they led in exile for some 17 centuries.
Change came only after Europe's Jewish population exploded from 1
million in 1600 to 11 million by 1800. Much as the rabbis tried to
shore up the ghetto, Europe's Jews spilled out, to live, work and
study among the Gentiles.</TE>
<TE>   This was during the era called the Enlightenment, when man
replaced God at the hub of the universe, when science trumped
revelation in explaining life's mysteries, when clerics lost their
special authority and faith became a matter of individual choice.</TE>
<TE>   Untouched by Europe's previous intellectual waves, Jews were
tantalized by these ideas. While portions of the community remained
steadfastly pious, others adopted a secular outlook. Many talked of
modernizing Judaism; a few left the faith entirely. By the 19th
century, Judaism was, like Christianity, divided into denominations:
Reform and Conservative, both products of the Enlightenment, and
Orthodoxy, which rejected the new ideas as heresy and refused to
surrender its claim to religious preeminence.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Enlightenment had also revealed an ugly underside.
Napoleon infused it with a rabid nationalism, to which others added a
racism that complemented the anti-Semitism long rooted in Christian
theology. In the decades that followed, Charles Darwin's ideas on
evolution, another fruit of the Enlightenment, were distorted to make
a scientific case for Jewish inferiority. As the 20th century opened,
hopes for a Jewish future based on freedom and equality were suffused
with foreboding. The response of some Jews was to found Zionism, a
secular movement whose aim was to provide refuge for Jews exposed to
the looming dangers.</TE>
<TE>   But Jews did not reunite around Zionism. Orthodoxy, bound by a
belief that only the Messiah could lead them back to the Holy Land,
viewed it as nothing more than Enlightenment poison. Many Reform and
Conservative Jews saw it as inconsistent with Jewish integration into
the larger society. A Zionist faction called Revisionism emerged,
drawing upon the Enlightenment's Napoleonic wing to insist on a
militant, expansive Jewish state. Still another faction, known as
religious Zionism, accepted the Jews' need for refuge but insisted
that a Jewish state must be governed by religious law.</TE>
<TE>   All these forces -- and more -- are alive in Israel today, often
stridently advancing their claims and undermining the stability of
the democratic state:</TE>
<TE>   * The Labor Party, direct descendant of Zionism's secular
founders, led the way to the establishment of a Jewish state based on
democratic practices and civil law. It also provided leadership for a
series of successful wars, most notably the War of Independence in
1948 and the Six-Day War, which, in 1967, created the dilemma of the
occupied lands. In recent decades the Labor Party has lost much favor
with the electorate, but, supported by several secular parties with
slightly different ideologies, it continues to head the campaign for
a peace agreement with the Arabs based on territorial withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   * Likud is the Revisionist party, heir of the Enlightenment's
Napoleonic wing. Long a minority, Likud grew in strength in rejecting
the return of territory after the Six-Day War. Without religious
ideology, it has shown some readiness to compromise, most
dramatically in evacuating the Sinai in 1979 to achieve peace with
Egypt. But as a minority party, it depends heavily on Israel's
religious forces to attain its territorial ends.</TE>
<TE>   * Israel's Orthodox community participates actively in secular
politics, though in theory it still rejects the Zionist state as
heresy. Having been granted jurisdiction at Israel's founding over
such personal matters as marriage and divorce, it uses its power to
extend its authority over daily life and to deny recognition to its
Reform and Conservative rivals. With its roots in tradition and its
political alliances, Orthodoxy's influence is far greater than its
numbers suggest.</TE>
<TE>   * Both Reform and Conservative Judaism, with the support of
American Jews, are growing stronger in Israel's secular community.
But without parties they are politically powerless, which forces them
to turn to the courts rather than to parliament in their efforts to
reach equality with entrenched Orthodoxy.</TE>
<TE>   * Religious Zionism, long an adjunct to secular Zionism, soared to
great power after the Six-Day War, when it brought unanticipated
zealotry to promoting a doctrine that held that God commanded Israel
to keep the occupied lands in perpetuity. Backbone of the settlers'
movement, which has installed 450,000 Jews on the territory captured
in 1967, religious Zionism has shown a disdain for civil law and
thwarted every effort to exchange territory for peace. When Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin proposed in 1994 to evacuate one small
settlement as part of the Oslo accords, religious Zionist rabbis
ruled that his plan would violate Jewish law and that soldiers were
barred from enforcing it. Faced with the prospect of a Jewish civil
war, Rabin backed down, just before a young zealot claiming to act in
God's name assassinated him. Religious Zionism, by threatening the
country with civil war, has added significantly to its power to
enforce its territorial vision.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the political panorama, it is necessary to cite two
additional groups. One is Shas, Israel's largest religious party,
which received about 13% of the vote in the last Israeli election. It
claims to represent some 2 million Sephardim, Jews who, having lived
for centuries in isolation in the Arab world, were never exposed to
the Enlightenment. The other, 1 million strong, comprises recently
arrived Jews from Russia, where czarism and then communism
neutralized the effect of the Enlightenment. The two, both hard-line
on peace, have added large constituencies to the Likud-religious
alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The shadow of the Enlightenment thus hovers over Israel, imparting
to it a political character unlike that of other Western democracies.
Israelis, having never laid to rest the issues raised by the
Enlightenment, have also failed to accommodate to the diversity that
these issues created.</TE>
<TE>   Though a majority favor territorial withdrawal, a larger majority
give priority to their religious and social ideals. Ordinary Israelis
rarely quarrel over banal matters like economics or the environment.
They fight over the definition of the Jewish state and Jewish
society. They differ over Weltanschauung, their worldview -- and,
more precisely, over whose worldview will succeed in dominating the
culture as a whole.</TE>

To come together would require, as a start, that Israelis listen to
one another, carefully and respectfully. Instead, it is hard to hear

<LD>George Foreman, who was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame
in October, has purchased a furnished Malibu townhome for close to
its asking price of $2.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   Foreman, who lives in Houston, bought the beachfront pied-a-terre
as a place to stay when visiting the L.A. area, where one of his 10
children attends college. All of his sons are named George.</LD>
<LD>   The townhouse has two master suites in 2,800 square feet and an
attached two-car garage. The unit, built in 1990, is on three levels,
each with a balcony.</LD>
<TE>   Foreman, an Olympic gold medalist who knocked out Joe Frazier to
win the heavyweight championship in the early '70s, lost the title to
Muhammad Ali and left boxing in 1977. In 1994, after founding the
Back Door to the World ministry in Texas, Foreman won the heavyweight
title again at age 45.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Foreman has become a familiar TV face, endorsing
cooking appliances and appearing on HBO as a boxing analyst. Salton,
manufacturer of George Foreman's Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling
Machine, bought the former boxing champ's name and image for use in
promoting the grill and other kitchen products in late 1999 for about
$137.5 million in cash and stock.</TE>
<TE>   "George Foreman's Guide to Life: How to Get Up Off the Canvas When
Life Knocks You Down," a Simon &amp; Schuster book, is due to be
published in January.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Urbach of A.M. Realty in Pacific Palisades and Foreman's
attorney, Henry Holmes of the Santa Monica law firm of Greenberg
Traurig, represented Foreman. Carl Straub of Coldwell Banker's Malibu
West office had the listing.</TE>
<TE>   '90210' star is leaving behind another ZIP Code</TE>
<TE>   Tori Spelling, who is planning to star in and co-executive produce
a sitcom for NBC, has sold a Hollywood Hills home for about $3
million.</TE>
<TE>   Spelling bought the house in 1999 and expected to remodel it. She
razed the kitchen and the bathrooms and put in a retaining wall but
left the home to be completed by the buyer, described as a developer.</TE>
<TE>   When Spelling bought it, the house had four bedrooms and four
bathrooms in about 3,500 square feet. The traditional-style home is
on a private, gated promontory with a grassy yard, pool and city
views. The home also has a guest house.</TE>
<TE>   Spelling was in her 10th season playing Donna in the series
"Beverly Hills 90210" when she bought the house for about $2.9
million. Now she plans to play an up-and-coming corporate publicist
at a large New York firm in her new series. The sitcom, based on her
original idea, is still untitled.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, 29, has appeared in such movies as "The House of Yes"
(1997), the independent film "trick" (1999) and "Scary Movie 2"
(2001). She has been in such TV movies as "A Friend to Die For"
(1994).</TE>
<TE>   Judy Feder at Hilton &amp; Hyland, Beverly Hills, had the listing,
real estate sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Former King gives up the beach life</TE>
<TE>   Rogie Vachon, the first L.A. Kings player to have his jersey
retired, has sold his home in Playa del Rey for $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Vachon, who most recently has been special assistant to the
president of the Kings, and his wife, Nicole, plan to move to Palm
Springs and buy a second home in Canada. He is a native of Quebec.</TE>
<TE>   The Playa del Rey home has five bedrooms and four bathrooms in
nearly 3,000 square feet. Built in 1956 but remodeled in 1992, the
contemporary-style house has panoramic ocean views and direct beach
access. The kitchen has granite counters, the family room has a stone
fireplace and the rooftop deck has a spa.</TE>
<TE>   Rogie Vachon was one of the NHL's top goaltenders during his
16-year playing career. After retiring as a player, he joined the
Kings coaching staff in 1982. He was the Kings' general manager from
1984 to 1992. Later, he served as team president and chief hockey
operations officer. His L.A. Kings jersey No. 30 was retired in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Berman and Pat Kandel of Coldwell Banker, Marina del Rey,
had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Model remakes home near Strip</TE>
<TE>   Jason Shaw, a top Tommy Hilfiger model, has purchased a Sunset
Strip-area home for slightly more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, 29, and his girlfriend, Paris Hilton, are already renovating
the property. Hilton, 21, is the great-granddaughter of Conrad
Hilton, founder of Hilton hotels.</TE>
<TE>   The Mediterranean-style home that Shaw bought has two bedrooms and
two bathrooms plus a den in about 2,200 square feet. The home, built
in the 1940s, also has gardens and city views.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw and two friends he met at the University of Chicago
collaborated on writing, editing and acting in the movie "Liar's
Club," which had a limited run after it debuted in September. Hilton
appeared in the movie "Nine Lives," which opened last spring.</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Wilson of Nelson Shelton &amp; Associates, Beverly Hills,
represented both sides of the Sunset Strip-area purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Moving on to the next production</TE>
<TE>   Bill D'Elia, co-creator of the CBS series "Judging Amy" and
executive producer of "Chicago Hope" and "Ally McBeal," and his
interior decorator wife, Ellie, have listed their La Canada
Flintridge home of 10 years at $2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   The couple wants to spend more time in a gated community in Seal
Beach, where they are renovating a home.</TE>
<TE>   The gated La Canada home has seven bedrooms and six bathrooms in
nearly 5,000 square feet. The master suite includes a sitting room,

<HD>Megan's Law gives buyers another tool</HD>
<DH>Think you know the neighborhood? Think again. Home shoppers
are turning to sex offender databases to get the whole picture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michelle Hofmann</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Larissa Schultz and Ernie Duran looked beyond the usual
considerations -- price, size and location -- when buying their
Signal Hill condominium. The couple also researched the number of
registered sex offenders reported as living in the area.</LD>
<LD>   Since July 1, 1999, California law has required that purchase
contracts for residential property serve as a notification to buyers
of the availability of information on sex offenders. They also must
include resources for information, such as county Web-based
information as well as the state's Megan's Law database, a public
notification and registration program named for a 7-year-old New
Jersey girl who was raped and murdered in 1994 by a twice-convicted
sex offender who moved into her neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Because the law does not require sellers or agents to track down
the number of registered sex offenders in any given area, June
Barlow, vice president and general counsel of the California Assn. of
Realtors, recommends that home buyers do their own research on sex
offenders in an area before making a purchase.</LD>
<TE>   Told by her real estate agent about the availability of such data,
Schultz used the Los Angeles County Sex Offender Locator Web site and
discovered there were five "serious" sex offenders living within
one-tenth of a mile of the condominium she wanted to buy and 22
within a one-half mile radius.</TE>
<TE>   Orange, San Diego and Riverside counties also provide this
information online. The county sites use color-coded maps to show
approximate locations of convicted sex offenders. However, unlike
Megan's Law online reports, which have more detailed information,
county site maps can be searched only by ZIP Codes, addresses,
schools or parks.</TE>
<TE>   Residents statewide can access Megan's Law information via
computer terminals at justice and probation departments, college
campus police stations and sheriff and police departments. The
database allows viewers to search by name, ZIP Code, county, birth
date, physical description and crime. It provides details on physical
appearance, ethnic background, aliases, identifying marks and
tattoos, sometimes with photos. It also describes the crimes
committed, using penal code sections to identify and explain the
types of crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Offenders are categorized as "other" (someone convicted of
indecent exposure, pornography or spousal rape), "serious" (a felony
sex offender or misdemeanor child molester) and "high risk" (those
with a higher recidivism rate, which means they may pose a greater
danger to the public). According to the state Department of Justice,
California is home to about 97,077 known sex offenders, including
17,047 in Los Angeles County and 3,119 in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the facts and comfortable with their decision, Duran
and Schultz, who don't have children, purchased the Signal Hill home
anyway. "If we had found a [known] sex offender living within the
condominium complex, that may have affected our decision," she said.</TE>
<TE>   However, not every informed buyer is still willing to buy. For
some, concerns about reduced home prices and safety issues related to
living near a registered sex offender are deal breakers.</TE>
<TE>   Will Brown, a real estate agent at Century 21 Better Homes in
Santa Monica, said one buyer backed out of a deal after the family
learned that three sex offenders lived within one mile of the sale
property. The client bought a different home.</TE>
<TE>   Barlow suggested that buyers use the inspection period to research
the property themselves. As with any potential problem related to
purchasing a home, buyers who locate known sex offenders living close
to the property during the inspection period have the right to
terminate sales contracts and receive full refunds of their deposits,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   When moving to an area with known sex offenders, Barlow said,
buyers should consider factors such as the route their children might
take to school, the nature of the offense and how far away the
offender lives.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Brown said buyers who have lived in an area for some
time and are looking to buy nearby should not assume they know the
neighborhood. "I can't imagine investing $500,000 in a property and
walking in there ignorant," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, about 250,000 people have viewed the state's Megan's
Law database, searching for information on employees, child-care
workers, pastors, neighbors, landlords, tenants, coaches, youth
counselors, teachers, friends, boyfriends, spouses and family
members, according to Mike Van Winkle, state Department of Justice
spokesman. And for the last six years, the state agency has provided
Megan's Law information at the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   Camille Abdalla did not search the database before purchasing her
Pasadena home in June 2000. While visiting the fair with her
2-year-old daughter in September, Abdalla and her husband, Anthony,
checked the Megan's Law database. They found 38 known sex offenders
in their ZIP Code.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked at every single picture, hoping that I wouldn't see
anyone I recognized," she said. "I didn't."</TE>
<TE>   But 21 of the 1,300 viewers who checked the database this year
during the fair's first three days did find someone they recognized,
Van Winkle said.</TE>
<TE>   Surprised by the numbers, Abdalla said she would do more research
before purchasing another house and probably would not buy close to a
registered child molester.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a young family, and I wouldn't want to have to constantly
remind my daughter about the [offender] three doors away," she said.
"I don't want to live in fear."</TE>
<TE>   Today, 28 states have some kind of Web-based sex offender
information. However, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments
last week in cases from Connecticut and Alaska that could determine
how far states can go in keeping track of convicted sex offenders and
sharing the information with the public.</TE>
<TE>   California has been tracking adult sex offenders since 1944. In
1995, the California Sex Offender Information hotline, formerly known
as the Child Molester Identification Line, provided a phone service
with public information about registered sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Megan's Law database</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Megan's Law expanded the service. Its first incarnation
came in the form of a CD-ROM updated monthly and sent to law
enforcement agencies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice
reportedly published its last CD-ROM in June. Although some agencies
still may be using CD-ROM data from June, Van Winkle said most
Megan's Law database computer terminals are electronically updated
daily.</TE>
<TE>   To access Megan's Law, users must be 18 years old, have valid
California driver's licenses or ID and sign statements that they are
not registered sex offenders and will not use the information to
locate or harass registrants. The screening process weeds out sex
offenders who may try to use the database to network with
child-pornography rings and pedophiles, said Diane Webb, a detective
in the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division.</TE>
<TE>   Offenders are required to register with local law enforcement
agencies within five working days of being released from jail or
prison and annually within five days of a birthday, relocation or
name change. They must comply with the law for the rest of their
lives, and violent offenders must provide information every 90 days;
transients every 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the system represents only a fraction of the nation's
actual sexual predators and does not provide accurate information on
their locations.</TE>
<TE>   However, Van Winkle said his research suggests 70% to 75% of
registrants are in compliance and living at their stated location.</TE>
<TE>   Still, because sex offenders are mobile, Barlow said it is
important for buyers and residents to check the information on a
regular basis.</TE>
<TE>   Signal Hill condo buyer Shultz is sold on the idea. "In this day
and age, I consider [Megan's Law] to be a basic safety item, like
checking for smoke detectors and crime statistics. It's common sense,
especially because the information is free and available."</TE>

<HD>Taking off in two directions</HD>
<DH>A Claremont couple expands their 1953 home by going up with
a curved ceiling and down with a basement library.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy Price-Robinson</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sale of Ned Freed and Tamara McDonald-Freed's software company in
the '90s gave them the means to expand their Claremont home twice.</LD>
<LD>   First they went up, adding a loft office under a vast barrel
ceiling overlooking the dining room, living room and a library
addition.</LD>
<LD>   Last year they went down, creating a basement library for the
remainder of Freed's 7,000 books, housed in finely crafted shelves.</LD>
<TE>   He bought the two-bedroom house in the late '80s and decided it
had potential. With architectural details considered avant-garde for
1953, the home had a flat roof with wide overhangs and post-and-beam
construction, which allowed large expanses of glass.</TE>
<TE>   Freed grew up in a contemporary home and saw beyond gothic details
imposed by a previous owner, the poorly remodeled kitchen without one
apparent true right angle and an aviary stretching across the back of
the house.</TE>
<TE>   With the birth of a son, Thomas, in 1990, the family lived in the
house as it was for the first few years. Freed, who works at home,
set up an office in a corner of the living room until "the house
started getting on our nerves."</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the first remodel in 1995 was to create a proper
office and a place for Freed's large book collection. Plus, there was
another problem. "The kitchen was a huge mess" and needed to be
redone, McDonald-Freed said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the couple had more money than tolerance for shoddy work,
they sought out a high-quality contractor. Over the years, they'd
heard their share of remodeling horror stories.</TE>
<TE>   "Ned and I didn't want that to happen to us," McDonald-Freed said.</TE>
<TE>   Friends had used HartmanBaldwin Design/Build, a Claremont company
known for upscale remodels and historic preservation. Freed liked
that HartmanBaldwin is a design-build firm, which means that the
architect and builder work for the same company. The relationship
minimizes the potential for an adversarial situation between an
architect and a contractor should something go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest dilemma was where to put Freed's office. He didn't
want to be cut off from his son. "He likes Thomas to be able to
wander in and wander out," said Devon Hartman, co-owner of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Tucking Freed's office into the corner of a room seemed the only
answer until one of the company's designers came up with an idea to
pop up the ceiling to create an office on a bridge, accessed by a
spiral staircase, overlooking both an enlarged dining room and the
new library, which would be added to the front of the house. The new
ceiling would have a dramatic arch on curved beams held up by massive
iron posts sunk into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I heard about it, I wanted it," Freed said.</TE>
<TE>   To get approval from Claremont's picky Architectural Commission,
HartmanBaldwin's presentation stressed that the new arched roof would
mesh with the house's modern style.</TE>
<TE>   To assuage neighbors' fears, the company hosted several teas at
the house to show drawings of the proposed additions. The commission
approved the project without objection.</TE>
<TE>   Planning for the second phase began when it became evident that
the library addition wasn't large enough. Freed reads half a book a
day -- mysteries, science fiction, literature -- and enjoys rereading
them. He also has an extensive collection of dictionaries, his late
father's medical books and a collection of plays.</TE>
<TE>   But McDonald-Freed is sensitive to dust, and the six ceiling-high
bookcases that had taken over a wall in their bedroom were too much
for her. Plus, she told her husband, what they really needed was
another bathroom for Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   The library basement was Freed's idea to create square footage on
the 9,081-square-foot lot. During his childhood in Oklahoma,
tornadoes regularly drove his family to the basement.</TE>
<TE>   The couple went back to HartmanBaldwin for the second phase. The
10-month remodel last year called for tearing down the entire bedroom
wing of the house and replacing it with a bedroom and bathroom for
Thomas, a new bedroom and bath for the couple, the basement and
another bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   When construction began, the builders boarded up the doorway where
the wing connected to the house and didn't open it until 30 days
before the project was done, protecting the family from most of the
dust and noise created by the job. The previous library addition
became the couple's temporary bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Excavating the site for the basement was a major undertaking, but
Dave Robertson, one of two job foremen, had experience with
basements. The tricky part was getting earth-moving equipment into a
narrow area with the neighbor's rock wall only a few feet away.</TE>
<TE>   After four days of machine excavation, it took two and a half more
weeks of hand digging and hauling rocks and soil up a ramp with a
wheelbarrow to be loaded into bins and hauled away.</TE>
<TE>   The footings were set with concrete and steel reinforcement. A
shell of concrete masonry block followed, with a sophisticated
waterproofing system of emulsion, matting, foam board, perforated
drain pipes and backfill of gravel.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the basement has radiant floor heating, double-depth
shelving and a workroom for Freed outfitted with his dad's worn
workbench. "I'm a tinkerer," Freed said.</TE>
<TE>   There is access to the whole-house stereo and the home's heating
and cooling systems, including a new solar-powered system tied into
the electrical grid so the meter runs backward on sunny days.</TE>
<TE>   Among the project's few setbacks: The wrong tile was delivered for
Thomas' bathroom, and it would take six to eight weeks to get the
right tile.</TE>
<TE>   "I went berserk when I found out they sent us the wrong tile,"
said Allen Suckley, the other foreman on the job, who also built the
first phase. At that point, McDonald-Freed was tired of camping in
the library and wanted to take shortcuts to get the job done. But
Suckley talked her into waiting to do it right.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the house, everything is precision-made, from the maple
and cherry cabinets to the stained-glass window in the stairwell.</TE>
<TE>   To McDonald-Freed, the clutter-free, finely crafted house "is
really a piece of art."</TE>
<TE>   "This is it," said McDonald-Freed, running her hand across the
marble counter in her newly opulent bathroom. "This is the dream
house. Ned and I want to leave this house feet first."</TE>

<LD>Susan Baskin's narrative of her journey of self-discovery as a Jew
("Out of Hiding," Oct. 27) gives the impression that the turning
point in this journey occurred when she carried a sign handed to her
at a Westwood rally protesting anti-Israel terrorism. I think a
closer reading of her essay reveals that she experienced her most
important turning point much earlier--when she delved into the study
of Judaism. As she says, "My study of Judaism fed my mind and my
spirit." I believe it is the convictions and insights that such a
study formed that generated in her the courage and commitment that
has motivated Jews to stay Jewish since antiquity. Without such
study, she would not have developed this commitment.</LD>

<TE>   I find my Jewish soul best expressed in the defense of freedom and
justice and human rights no matter the victim, and I believe the
slogan that came out of the Holocaust, "Never again," refers to the
mandate to fight for justice wherever it is needed. Baskin could just
as easily find her Jewish voice in the movement for a just peace
between Arabs and Jews. Those of us who oppose the brutal Israeli
occupation also take issue with the targeting of innocent civilians,
be they Arabs or Jews. As more and more Israeli officials openly
discuss the "transfer" of millions of Palestinians, one wonders if
there are Israelis truly connected to the lessons of the Diaspora who
will hide our Arab brothers and sisters when the authorities come to
round them up!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming as it did as the season of flame winds down across the West,
"Burn It to Save It" (by Wade Graham, Oct. 20) was timely and
comprehensive. After decades of fire suppression and mismanagement,
we have reached a point where real solutions are needed if we are to
crack the fire paradox.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, if the risk of catastrophic fire is going to be reduced
across the West, a wide variety of tools will be needed, including
prescribed burning, strategic thinning and brush removal. Top
priority must be placed on reducing the risk of fire near homes and
communities. An approach also must be mounted, such as the one set
forth in the Sierra Nevada Framework, a landmark plan in California
that balances old forest protection with reducing the risk of fire.
At the end of the trail, we need to better understand and accept the
role of fire.</LD>

<HD>Is the PTA Relevant to Children?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Los Angeles</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I would love it if the PTA's focus was, as your article stated, a way
to improve parent involvement in the schools ("Can the PTA Get a
Passing Grade?" by Molly Selvin and Gail Zellman, Oct. 20). That is
the key to success with our children's education, but local benefits
are pushed aside for the so-called "benefit of the whole."</LD>
<LD>   Take a look at the PTA's Web site and the long list of issues it's
dealing with on a national level. But on the local level, PTA work is
so time-consuming and paperwork-laden that while it may help parents
become better leaders in the community, it provides little immediate
benefit to the local students it should serve. Does the PTA serve our
children? I think the parents involved in their childrens' schools
have the right heart but are involved in the wrong organization.</LD>
<LD>   M. Moore</LD>
<TE>   San Pedro</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Is the PTA relevant? The answer can be found in the startling
statistics released in October by the child advocacy group Children
Now. In a nationwide study, California had the eighth highest rate of
child poverty and 25% of the state's children come from low-income
families. The 10th District PTA's low-cost eye and dental clinics are
more relevant than ever.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Landlord's sound, but tough advice</HD>
<DH>The Landlord's Kit, By Jeffrey Taylor, Dearborn Trade
Publishing: 219 pages, $18.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert J. Bruss</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you own residential rental houses or apartments, or want to
someday, you're going to profit from reading "The Landlord's Kit" by
Jeffrey Taylor. Known as "Mr. Landlord" for the superb monthly
newsletter he has published for more than 15 years, Taylor reveals
his profitable rental management secrets in his new book.</LD>
<LD>   For example, he begins by explaining why the rental application is
the landlord's best cash-flow tool. He then shares how to "sell" your
vacancy to prospects and how to avoid having a few unscrupulous
tenants take unfair advantage of the landlord.</LD>
<LD>   Each chapter contains several pages of concise explanations, such
as how to use the "rental holding deposit receipt" correctly to hold
the apartment or rental house for the applicant. Taylor also explains
how and why landlords should use the verification forms to "evict
deadbeats before they move in."</LD>
<TE>   The best parts of each chapter are the superb forms, which readers
are invited to copy for personal use.</TE>
<TE>   A unique aspect of Taylor's rental screening is his point system
to identify qualified applicants. It is much like a credit score or
FICO score system that most lenders use.</TE>
<TE>   He gives points for a good credit report, a checking account, a
savings account, no prior evictions and even appearing on time for
the rental showing appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Whether you are a novice or experienced landlord, you'll
especially enjoy and profit from how Mr. Landlord puts his tenants on
the "automatic rent payment plan" to withdraw monthly rent
electronically from their checking or savings accounts. He says this
works especially well with parents who pay their college student's
rent.</TE>
<TE>   Frankly, Mr. Landlord seems like one tough landlord. To
illustrate, if he agrees to accept a tenant's pet, he interviews the
pet. Also, he requires self-employed applicants to submit tax returns
to verify income.</TE>
<TE>   "Be tough during the first two to six months," he advises, to
condition and train new tenants.</TE>

<HD>Fed up with noisy leaf blowers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Glassman and Donie Vanitzian Special to The Times</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We live in a common interest development in Los Angeles and
are fed up with loud lawn mowers and leaf blowers. Our gardener has
been fined three times for using leaf blowers and loud equipment. Our
board pays all the fines and encourages the gardeners to ignore the
law.</LD>
<LD>   The owner of the gardening business charges us more to use rakes
and justifies the higher cost by calling it "manual labor." Even
paying more, his workers continue to use the blowers for everything
but leaves. I wake up to the smell of exhaust and the noise of loud
equipment right outside my front door very early in the morning.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners have tried to ask the gardeners to stop, but they mock
us by using the blower to blow circles around us.</LD>
<TE>   The board said that because the leaf blower is mounted on the
gardener's back, it is legal. The city told us they are understaffed
and don't have the budget to take care of these complaints. The
police don't seem to be interested either, as we keep calling but
they don't show up. What is the law and what are we to do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Invented in Japan in the 1970s and adopted by California
in the drought-plagued 1980s, leaf blowers were labeled as one of the
country's "inventions we love to hate" in a Learning Channel
documentary and voted the third-worst invention ever, behind parking
meters and car alarms.</TE>
<TE>   Although challenged by various nationwide consumer watch groups,
manufacturers claim leaf blowers are estimated to be about five times
faster than rakes when it comes to moving debris around.</TE>
<TE>   Critics note, however, that rakes don't routinely generate noise
levels of 70 to 75 decibels, nor do rakes launch particulates into
the atmosphere. As determined by the American National Standards
Institute, a 65-decibel level measured at a distance of 50 feet can
actually be as high as 90 decibels outside your front door.</TE>
<TE>   The rules on leaf blowers are contingent upon where you live. In
Los Angeles, use of gas-powered blowers "within 500 feet of a
residence at anytime" is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Both the user of the blower and the individual or association
"that contracted for the services of the user, if any, shall be
subject to a fine not to exceed" $100. Penalty assessments added to
those fines can bring the total to $270.</TE>
<TE>   By paying the fines incurred by the gardeners, the board may
actually be a party to the illegal conduct. The board's concerns
should include homeowner complaints about how the noise is affecting
the quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcement is a problem, acknowledged James Washington, a chief
inspector in the city Bureau of Street Services, because "there are
only two officers for the Los Angeles area."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Strick, the West Los Angeles neighborhood prosecutor,
stressed it is still important to "educate employers, homeowners and
homeowner association boards that the Los Angeles Municipal Code
prohibits use of gasoline leaf blowers within 500 feet of a
residence."</TE>
<TE>   "Placing the blower on one's back is still a violation of the
ordinance," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the state level, California's Health and Safety Code, Section
41700, states that "no person shall discharge from any source
whatsoever such quantities of air contaminants or other material
which cause injury, detriment, nuisance, or annoyance to any
considerable number of persons or to the public, or which endanger
the comfort, repose, health, or safety of any such persons or the
public, or which cause, or have a natural tendency to cause, injury
or damage to business or property."</TE>
<TE>   If the leaf blowing is occurring within the city of Los Angeles,
inquire at your local Los Angeles Police Department station about the
possibility of a citizen's arrest. If fines are levied on a regular
basis, that might put a stop to the noise and air pollution you are
experiencing. Boards that employ vendors that break the law also face
fines and prosecution for each infraction.</TE>
<TE>   "Quiet enjoyment" is a term lawyers use, but it says exactly what
the homeowner is entitled to, even for those living in
deed-restricted developments. A Web site for more information and
links to leaf blower facts is www.zapla.org.</TE>

<HD>A slice of small-town America in Orange</HD>

<LD>Old Towne Orange offers its 11,300 residents a chance to step back in
time. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the Orange
County community of about 1,200 homes has the largest collection of
historical houses in California. At its heart is the Plaza Square
park, with a landmark fountain dating to the city's founding in the
1870s.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   Sidewalks and homes with front porches encourage strolling and
talking with neighbors in this quiet, low-crime community on the
western edge of Orange. Dining and shopping are within walking
distance at the Plaza Historic District, which has more than 100
owner-operated businesses, including restaurants, sidewalk cafes,
coffee shops, antique stores, eclectic gift shops, various services
and galleries.</LD>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   Old Towne has an impressive mix of well-maintained homes in a
variety of architectural styles -- Victorian, Craftsman, Bungalow,
Mediterranean Revival, Prairie and Spanish Colonial. The Plaza
Historic District consists of functioning historic buildings,
including a post office from the 1920s, a railroad station and a
variety of churches. The community's oldest business, Watson's Drug
Store, is an old-fashioned soda fountain and pharmacy that opened in
1899. Hollywood has used Old Towne as a location over the years to
capture a small-town, historic feel. Recent films shot here include
"Big Momma's House," "Clockstoppers," "That Thing You Do" and "Small
Soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   The vintage buildings and attention to historic preservation fuel
a strong sense of community. Residents of all ages come together at
Plaza Square on a regular basis for such community events as the
Christmas tree lighting and the Labor Day weekend Street Fair,
started in 1910.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   Homes tend to be small in square footage, and renovations are
often required. Keeping history maintained can be costly. Though full
of restaurants, the plaza lacks a movie theater or other
entertainment draw. And there are no grocery stores in Old Towne.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   The northeast quadrant of Old Towne is the most desirable because
of its mix of 1877 to 1930s homes. Prices range from $300,000 to
$800,000 for 800 to 3,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Stock report</TE>
<TE>   Single-family homes make up 90% of the housing. Apartment
complexes and duplexes account for the rest. Because the houses were
built by individual owners, no two are alike.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Part of the Orange Unified School District, public schools here
fall below average in national test scores. Some residents choose to
enroll their children in private schools within Old Towne, including
St. John's Lutheran School and Immanuel Lutheran School.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>

ranging from $265,900 to $779,000.</TE>

<HD>Reform plan faces hurdles</HD>
<DH>While many consumer organizations back the HUD proposals,
some industry groups oppose guaranteed fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth R. Harney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Should millions of home buyers and refinancers have the option of
shopping for a guaranteed, fixed-price package of settlement costs on
their mortgage, along with the interest rate quote?</LD>
<LD>   Wouldn't such a choice provide at least some improvement on the
current system, in which last-minute settlement charges can add
hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars of unexpected expenses to
a mortgage transaction?</LD>
<LD>   Most major consumer organizations, including the Consumer
Federation of America, AARP, Consumers Union and the National
Consumer Law Center, endorse the basic concept of guaranteed fees.
The 35-million-member AARP, formerly the American Assn. of Retired
Persons, said the settlement-cost packaging plan proposed by Housing
Secretary Mel Martinez represents "a novel concept to promote true
comparison shopping" that will "exponentially enhance consumer
understanding" and provide certainty to consumers.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposed alternative to the current system, rate quotes
that come with fixed-price costs would be "shoppable" among competing
lenders before you sign up. One lender might quote you 6% and $2,750
in total costs. A second lender might be $500 higher on closing
costs. A third might quote a lower interest rate but higher fees.
Once you pick the best rate-and-cost package, the deal would be
guaranteed and legally enforceable at settlement.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, you could still shop under a modified version of
the current system, in which rates are quoted but fees are not
guaranteed. The two alternatives would exist as parallel financing
options.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's staff at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development is reviewing 45,000-plus comments about the plan from
AARP and other groups. The agency hopes to adopt final rules
sanctioning guaranteed fees in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But not all comments are laudatory. In fact, some high-profile
trade groups are dead set against the idea. The 840,000-member
National Assn. of Realtors considers the packages "radical,"
"untested" and lacking in "consumer benefit."</TE>
<TE>   The group, in language that has some consumer advocates shaking
their heads in disbelief, said "there is little or no data to confirm
that large variances exist" between closing costs quoted to loan
applicants in the "good faith estimates" and what they're asked to
pay at closing.</TE>
<TE>   HUD, however, has documented thousands of consumer complaints
about surprise fees at settlements during the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups perplexed by the Realtors' opposition recalled that
the association traditionally has endorsed packaging and has
testified on Capitol Hill in favor of settlement-service "bundles"
and "one-stop shopping."</TE>
<TE>   In testimony before a Senate banking subcommittee in 1997, Russell
K. Booth, then president of the Realtors' group, said packaging
"provides added convenience and value to consumers, through reduction
of costs of search and related 'transaction' costs."</TE>
<TE>   Countering fears that packaged services would favor large
companies over smaller ones, Booth cited an academic study
commissioned by the Realtors that "found that bundling of services
does not disproportionately favor large firms."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen K. Cook, a spokesman for the Realtors, said the Martinez
proposal "is different from earlier proposals" in that it is centered
around mortgages. "We have concerns over loosening consumer
protections under [this] proposal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The group's official comments express fears that by allowing
"packagers" to escape current federal "anti-kickback" restrictions,
consumers could be deprived of legal protections they now have.</TE>
<TE>   The title insurance industry also is in the opposition camp. The
American Land Title Assn. questions HUD's statutory authority to
create the packaging option and worries that lenders will force title
and settlement agencies to roll back their prices in order to be
included in competitive packages.</TE>
<TE>   Also in opposition: Appraisers fear that there will be pressure to
decrease their fees as the price of inclusion in settlement packages.
That would affect "many small appraisal businesses," said a joint
letter from appraisal groups, and would encourage use of lower-cost
valuation alternatives to traditional appraisals.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for the new plan in 2003? Pretty good unless
politically powerful opponents can convince the new Congress that
lowering costs for homeowners and refinancers is a bad idea.</TE>

<AU>Ruth Ryon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rancho Caritina, once part of a working ranch on 30 acres, now sits
on one flat acre in Tarzana, its 1902 main house, guest house and
office restored and updated over the years.</LD>
<LD>   The gated estate, which has a tennis court, pool and horse barn,
has been owned for eight years by actress Jenilee Harrison and her
chiropractor husband, Bruce Oppenheim. They nearly doubled the size
of the living area, completing a $1.1-million renovation in late
1998.</LD>
<LD>   About this house: The house was originally a ranch hand and
foreman's quarters. It is now California ranch in style with
hand-carved woodwork reminiscent of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. A
wine cellar was built in what was the root cellar, and a 200-year-old
church door was added.</LD>
<TE>   Asking price: $2.9 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The main house has four bedrooms, 4 1/2 bathrooms and three
fireplaces in 5,500 square feet; a guest unit has two bedrooms and
two bathrooms in about 1,500 square feet, and a detached office,
which could be a second guest unit, has a bathroom and a kitchenette
in about 700 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: Horse facilities include a barn and turn-out with
misters, wash rack and tack room. The home also has a henhouse,
kennel, three-car garage and workroom. The grounds have fruit trees
and a rose garden.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a tennis pavilion with a bar, refrigerator and sink.
Except for the two-bedroom guest unit over the garage, the home is
single-story.</TE>

<HD>Can ad specify Cantonese speaker?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I recently tried to place a newspaper ad to rent a room in
my home. I would like to specify in the ad that I only want a
Cantonese-speaking tenant. Is it permissible to limit consideration
of potential tenants this way?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The answer depends on the reason why you want to limit
your ad to Cantonese-speaking applicants. Many readers would
interpret such a limitation as excluding anyone who is not Chinese.
It would be a violation of the fair housing laws to include such a
limitation if it is a pretext to hide your desire to only rent to
Chinese tenants.</LD>
<LD>   However, if you have a valid safety or operational need for a
Cantonese speaker, you could overcome the suspicion of
discrimination.</LD>
<TE>   One possible valid explanation might be that you are only capable
of giving or understanding simple responses or directions in
Cantonese. For example, if you could only talk to a tenant about the
need to properly turn off the stove in Cantonese, you could claim
that you have a non-discriminatory motive.</TE>
<TE>   For more information on discriminatory advertising, contact your
local fair housing agency.</TE>
<TE>   Manager has own way of figuring</TE>
<TE>   Question: I gave a 30-day notice to move on the 15th of next
month. My rent is $1,200 a month and the manager calculated the rent
for next month as $50 a day for the 15 days I will occupy the
property. When I calculated the daily rate, I came up with $40 a day.
The manager told me she was rounding up the daily rental rate in case
I stay over a day or two. Is this correct?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: No. The rent due for your last month's rent must be exact.
If you were to pay and the manager were to accept the $50 a day, or
$750, then your 30-day notice could be invalidated since you would
have paid rent for time beyond the 30-day notice. In this case, if
you wished, you could stay on as a tenant.</TE>
<TE>   The California standard to determine a daily rate is to divide the
rent by 30, even for months with 29 or 31 days. For those rent
amounts that do not divide evenly, round up to the nearest cent; for
example, $46.666 would be $46.67 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Your calculation of $40 a day is correct and you will owe the
landlord $600 for the next month's rent. If it becomes necessary to
stay a day or two over your 30-day time period, with the property
owner's permission the additional rent could be deducted from the
security deposit after you vacate the property. Civil Code 1950.5
allows for unpaid rent to be deducted from a tenant's security
deposit.</TE>
<TE>   Do I have to pay late rent fees?</TE>
<TE>   Question: About five years ago I was unemployed and had to pay my
rent late for two months. My landlord was very understanding and
allowed me to pay the rent late. We recently had a slight
misunderstanding and she is now telling me I owe $50 for late fees
from five years ago. Late fees are not listed on my rental agreement.
Do I have to pay the $50?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: No, because late fees are not currently a part of your
rental agreement, your landlord cannot request payment of the $50.</TE>
<TE>   To modify your rental agreement to include collection of late
fees, your landlord must give you a 30-day Change of Terms Notice.
Even if they were part of your current rental agreement, your
landlord has probably waived this claim by failing to request payment
in five years.</TE>
<TE>   At best, even when late fees are stated in a rental agreement,
they can be difficult to collect. For example, late fees can't be
deducted from security deposits and can't be requested on a 3-Day
Notice to Pay Rent or Quit. Therefore, it generally remains a
tenant's choice to pay them or not. If a tenant decides not to pay
and a landlord continues to insist on payment, the landlord must
pursue legal action, such as small claims court.</TE>
<TE>   In your case, any applicable statute of limitations has probably
expired.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The first big rain of the season is a reminder that it's time for
homeowners to tackle troublesome leaks overhead or assess the wear
and tear on a roof.</LD>
<LD>   But beware of unscrupulous contractors, cautions the Contractors
State License Board.</LD>
<LD>   Avoid rushing to make repairs and hiring someone without taking
the time to determine if he is a licensed qualified contractor.</LD>
<TE>   Any roofer performing work priced at $500 or more (labor and
materials) must be licensed by the state board, which operates under
the California Department of Consumer Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The board, which licenses 278,000 contractors in the state, offers
more advice in a free booklet, "New Tips for Hiring a Roofing
Contractor: A Consumer's Rights &amp; Responsibilities." It explains how
to find contractors, screen them to verify their current license
status and determine if there are any legal actions against them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Leave it to baby boomers to drive lifestyle trends. Having left
behind free love in the 1960s and plastic surgery in the 1990s,
aging, nesting boomers are now fueling interest, and sales, in second
homes.</LD>
<LD>   Having a vacation retreat is the main motivation for adding a
second home, followed by planning for retirement and diversifying
investments, according to a new survey of second-home owners
conducted by the National Assn. of Realtors and EscapeHomes.com,
which specializes in resort property and second homes.</LD>
<LD>   "In short, this market is driven by middle-class baby boomers"
motivated by lifestyle and investment considerations, said David
Lereah, the association's chief economist. The oldest boomers are now
56.</LD>
<TE>   The survey of existing owners, conducted this fall, showed the
typical second-home owner is 61, has owned the property for nine
years, earns a household income of $76,900, is married and purchased
the property for recreational use.</TE>
<TE>   A separate association survey last year that focused only on
second home-buyers showed the median age was 46 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of second homes have been increasing, rising to 359,000
units in 2001 from 264,000 units a decade earlier. "Approximately 6%
of all home sales each year are second homes," Lereah said.</TE>
<TE>   Only 56% of second-home buyers used mortgage financing. For other
sources of funds, 49% used savings, 10% tapped into equity from a
primary home or from a refinanced property, 9% sold stocks or bonds,
7% used inheritance, 5% used gifts from relatives or friends and 2%
used funds from the sale of personal property.</TE>

<LD>Discrimination nationwide against African Americans looking to buy a
home or rent appears to be waning, according to a new study by the
federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. Latinos also had
an easier time purchasing a home, but that was not the case when
renting.</LD>
<LD>   The results of the study, which included Los Angeles, showed that
black home buyers received unfavorable treatment in 17% of home sales
in 2000, down from 29% in 1989, the last time a similar survey was
conducted. Black renters encountered discrimination in 22% of
inquiries, less than the previous 26%. Discrimination against Latino
home buyers also eased, falling to 20% from 27%, but Latino renters
faced the same level of discrimination as in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The study, the third since 1977, was conducted in 23 metropolitan
areas by sending two individuals -- one a minority and the other a
white -- posing as renters or buyers with identical backgrounds
responding to advertised housing units.</LD>

<LD>Total existing-home sales activity in the third quarter of 2002 was
the third-highest on record, with 34 states and the District of
Columbia posting increases from a year ago, according to the National
Assn. of Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   The association's survey showed that nationwide, the seasonally
adjusted annual rate of existing single-family, condominium and
co-operative home sales totaled 6.21 million units in the third
quarter of this year, up 2.5% from the 6.07 million-unit pace in the
third quarter of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The record is a pace of 6.55 million units, recorded in the first
quarter of 2002; the second-highest level of sales activity was a
6.35-million annual rate in the second quarter of this year.</LD>
<TE>   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac,
the average commitment rate on a 30-year conventional fixed-rate
mortgage was 6.29% in the third quarter, down from 6.82% in the
second quarter; it was 6.97% in the third quarter of 2001. Last
quarter's average interest rate was the lowest since the Freddie Mac

<HD>Certain sellers to pay sooner</HD>
<DH>A new state tax law, which applies to the sale of
investment properties, goes into effect on Jan. 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under a new state law, residents and nonresidents who sell any home
in California other than their primary residence will be required to
withhold 3.33% of the sales price and turn the money over to the
Franchise Tax Board. The California Investment in Real Property Tax
Act, which goes into effect Jan. 1, is expected to affect 300,000
California real estate transactions worth $6.8 billion and will
increase state revenue by $225 million for fiscal year 2002-2003,
according to information released by the Franchise Tax Board.</LD>
<LD>   Although the new law does not impose new taxes or increase
existing taxes, it accelerates the receipt of tax revenue to the
state through withholding on investment properties, said June Barlow,
vice president and general counsel for the California Assn. of
Realtors.</LD>
<LD>   Typically home sellers pay taxes on the gains from the sale of a
property when they file tax returns. Under the new law, the state
will get funds at the time of the sale.</LD>
<TE>   Sellers who owe less than the funds withheld will get a refund
later when they file their tax returns. Even if the seller can prove
the withholding will exceed the gain, no waivers will be allowed
under the law, Barlow said.</TE>
<TE>   A property owner who sells a rental unit or vacation property
worth $500,000, for example, will give the state $16,650 in
withholding, regardless of the actual gain to the seller. If the
owners paid $450,000 for the property, they still will have to
withhold tax on the entire $500,000 sale, not the $50,000 in actual
gain.</TE>
<TE>   To owe $16,650 in taxes, the owner of that property would have to
have pocketed a gain of about $180,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Most sellers won't find out about this new law until they enter
escrow," said Mike Cain, a partner with Carlson, Safer, Cain &amp; Smith,
a Woodland Hills accounting firm. "They'll be shocked, and they'll be
powerless to do much about it."</TE>
<TE>   There are, however, a few exceptions to the new law. Withholding
will not be required, for example, if the home sale price is less
than $100,000. Exemptions also are permitted if the home is sold at a
loss or if it is exchanged for a like property.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new law, escrow companies are required to inform buyers
and sellers of their withholding obligations. If an escrow company
fails to do so, the escrow agent will be subject to penalties: $500
or 10% of the amount required to withhold, whichever is greater.</TE>
<TE>   "This law causes another complication in escrow," Barlow said.
"Many people sell because they want the money, but now they won't get
as much up front."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers who have minimal equity in their home will have to foot
the withholding bill from their own pocketbooks. And sellers who get
a big refund may get hit with a higher adjusted gross income the
following year, which could affect their tax planning, Cain said.</TE>
<TE>   While some owners may be put off from selling their properties,
others might find ways around the new law, possibly by restructuring
the sale into an entity such as an irrevocable trust or placing the
property into a corporation, for which different withholding rules
apply, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Cain said it's not easy to move real estate into corporations,
however. Those transactions can involve real estate taxes, changes of
title and other issues that many individuals would not want to
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   For wealthier investors, the law will barely make a ripple.
"People with more money have fewer things to complain about," said
Boyd Smith, a Coldwell Banker Previews agent in Pasadena. "This may
just be a topic of discussion for the holiday season, and then it
will burn away."</TE>

<DH>Mutombo focuses on helping Nets and African homeland</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Barker</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dikembe Mutombo lives in two worlds.</LD>
<LD>   The first is the glitzy, possession-to-possession life of the NBA.
It revolves around a ball, celebrity and millions of dollars in
material goods. A crisis in this world is a five-game losing streak.
A difficult mission is being asked to guard Shaquille O'Neal and
helping the New Jersey Nets try to win an NBA title.</LD>
<LD>   The second world is one of incomprehensible statistics, such as an
average weekly income of $20 and average life expectancy of 47. The
Democratic Republic of Congo, where Mutombo spent his first 21 years,
is in a constant state of need. A difficult mission there is getting
enough food and medical care to survive.</LD>
<TE>   Every morning, the 7-foot-2 Mutombo wakes up knowing he will have
to glide seamlessly between the two, similar to a lithe guard darting
in and out of the paint. Every morning he feels the pressure of
trying to balance the responsibility of being a good teammate with
the responsibility of being the kind of person he believes he should
be.</TE>
<TE>   Achieving incredible goals in the first world has helped Mutombo
work toward incredible goals in the second. On the court, he is one
of the most intimidating defensive presences in the game, famous for
sharp elbows and tentacle-like arms. Off of it, he is one of the
game's most soft-hearted individuals, having donated millions of
dollars and countless hours to help others, especially those in his
native Congo.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of my life is basketball," Mutombo said, "but it's not the
only thing God intended me to do." Mutombo has two dreams, two things
he believes he must accomplish before he walks away from the game.
Mutombo, 36, wants to win an NBA title. And he wants to finish the
$14 million hospital he is building for his people in the Congo.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that New Jersey is the place that can help him do
both.</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo got close enough to taste an NBA title when he went to the
2001 Finals with Philadelphia. Things in the brotherly city soured
last season, however, as the injury-riddled Sixers exited the
playoffs in the first round. Mutombo, forced to play a ton of
minutes, ran out of gas. He averaged a career-low 10.7 rebounds and
became a scapegoat for a lot of the team's offensive problems.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time Mutombo realized it wasn't going to happen for
him in Philadelphia, the Nets realized they weren't going to make any
headway against Western Conference teams without a bigger defensive
presence in the middle. The Nets, who were swept by the Lakers in
last season's NBA Finals, have to take a win-now attitude as there is
no guarantee that Jason Kidd will return after the season. That's why
they were willing to deal two starters -- Keith Van Horn and Todd
MacCulloch -- to bring Mutombo to New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good situation for Dikembe and a good situation for us,"
Net Coach Byron Scott said. "He's at a stage in his career when all
that is missing is a championship ring. As a team, that's what we're
shooting for. That's the kind of expectations we have. We both need
each other. We think Dikembe is really going to help this team."</TE>
<TE>   His dreams off the basketball court are even more difficult to
attain.</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo has made a second career out of helping others. His
Atlanta-based Dikembe Mutombo Foundation is in the middle of building
the first new hospital in the Congo in 42 years, a $14-million
project to which he personally has contributed more than $3.5
million. The foundation also has helped inoculate eight million
children for polio, or one out of every five people in a country
where 20 percent of the children die before their first birthday. It
also has shipped $250,000 worth of medical and pharmaceutical
supplies to existing hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo's largess, however, hasn't been limited to his native
country. He has served as a spokesman for CARE, the humanitarian
relief-effort organization. He has worked with youth in inner-city
schools in Atlanta and Philadelphia. And, since 1999, he has served
as the youth emissary for the United Nations Development Programme.
In that capacity, he has visited polio victims, spoken to kids on the
importance of AIDS awareness, recorded public service announcements
in French, English and Swahili and attended the international AIDS
conference in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a 7-foot-2 guy, but I think he has a bigger heart," Kidd
said. "He's the perfect role model."</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo says he learned his giving ways from his Sorbonne-educated
father, Samuel. A school superintendent, Samuel supported 10 kids, a
wife and a bevy of uncles, aunts and cousins on the equivalent of $37
a month in Kinshasa, the large capital city of what was then called
Zaire. While his NBA peers were honing their games in youth
basketball leagues after school, Mutombo helped out his family by
selling bread, cheese and sausages in a Kinshasa marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo, who speaks four languages and five African dialects, came
to the United States in 1987, on an academic scholarship to attend
Georgetown. In Luba culture, a father can give his name to only one
of his children. Dikembe, the seventh child, was the chosen one,
though he says he's not certain why. When he left for Georgetown, the
plan was to study medicine, become a doctor and return home. But when
Coach John Thompson saw the 7-2 Mutombo, the plan changed.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Mutombo, with a degree in African Studies and
Linguistics, was made the No. 4 pick in the 1991 draft by Denver. He
has been a four-time defensive player of the year with the Nuggets,
Hawks and 76ers, won two rebounding titles and appeared in eight
All-Star games.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a chance to get out and be the one that made a million
dollars and looked after everyone," Mutombo said. "I'm doing what I
love to do, and I'm in a position where I can help people."</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo has long been a big man with big goals. But his mission
turned personal in 1998 when his mother, Biamba Marie Mutombo, died
of a stroke. His country was in the midst of a long civil war, and
his family's efforts to get his mother to a hospital were blocked by
a government-mandated curfew. The war, which ended this summer, also
kept Mutombo from going to her funeral.</TE>
<TE>   In September 2001, Mutombo was in Kinshasa for the groundbreaking
of the Biamba Marie Mutombo Hospital, a 300-bed facility. His goal is
to have the hospital completed by the time his Net contract expires.</TE>
<TE>   Mutombo understands the value of his celebrity, understands what
his success on the basketball court could mean to his people back
home. For now, he says he is putting his energy into basketball. For
now, all his dreams are intertwined with the dreams of the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Said Mutombo: "I think God brought me here for a reason."</TE>

<DH>Coaches today motivate their players in different ways</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Murray</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Locker-room oratory is usually overdone, often backfires and is
seldom memorable.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the NFL cannot live without it. Every game, every team
meeting, requires a speech of some kind from the coach. Each coach
applies his own concept of motivation. The best use an economy of
words. The worst wade into hyperbole.</LD>
<LD>   Though the day of the rah-rah speech is largely gone from the
league, the need for communication with the players will never
disappear.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it will always be a part of leadership," said James
Harris, director of pro personnel for the Ravens and one-time NFL
quarterback. "But I think it starts with people respecting you.
You're wasting your time if there's no respect."</TE>
<TE>   The ability to motivate players has been a keynote in football
since Knute Rockne delivered his famous "Win one for the Gipper"
speech for Notre Dame in 1928. Every coach since then, from Vince
Lombardi to Bill Parcells to Jimmy Johnson, has tried to strike the
same chord.</TE>
<TE>   After all these years and all those pep talks, Ozzie Newsome said,
the coach's speech is still as important, still as relevant as it was
in the early days.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's a tone-setter," said Newsome, Ravens' senior vice
president for football operations and a Hall of Fame tight end.
"You're the leader, and the players are looking for you to lead. So
when you give that talk, you get the opportunity to set the tone for
that game and set the tone after the game."</TE>
<TE>   Speeches never win games, but they do provide a blueprint.
Delivered at the right time, with the right message, they can have a
lasting effect on a team.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Accorsi, general manager of the New York Giants, said
inspirational speeches can be delivered at the wrong time, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been a big believer in the speech before the game," he
said. "How long can it last? When players come out and jump all over
the place, sooner or later their feet have to hit the ground.
Preparation is the key.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is so complicated now, there are so many substitutions,
so many calls, formations, players on and off the field. You have to
think all the time. The old adage was, 'Prepare them so they don't
have to think on Sunday and play with emotion.' [But] if you don't
think on Sunday, you're in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   A more effective time to motivate is during the practice week and
in the team meeting Saturday night before the game. Bill Kuharich,
director of pro personnel for the Kansas City Chiefs, said it is
important for players to have confidence in the leadership of the
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the dialogue has to come during the week," he said. "It
has to be built up during the week so they understand when they're
struggling that the person in command has a plan, has a way to
execute the plan and they believe in what the process is.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you can flip a switch Saturday night or at
halftime. I've never been in a locker room where something was said
at halftime and turned the game around in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Fame coach Marv Levy was superb at providing perspective
during his 12-year tenure with the Buffalo Bills. A graduate of
Harvard, the professorial Levy rarely said much to the Bills in the
locker room before a game.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's just noise if you start to give pep talks in the
locker room," he said. "I do not think pep talks are very meaningful.
You can give instruction, though."</TE>
<TE>   One of Levy's best moments addressing the team came a day after a
wrenching, 20-19 Super Bowl loss to the Giants in 1991. On the flight
home, Levy thought of a poem he read in a book of English poetry
given him by his mother. The next day, he read "The Ballad of Sir
Andrew Barton." It said:</TE>
<TE>   Fight on my men, Sir Andrews said</TE>
<TE>   A little I'm hurt, but not yet slain</TE>
<TE>   I'll just lie down and bleed a while</TE>
<TE>   And then I'll rise and fight again</TE>
<TE>   At the end of that meeting, some 10 players were moved enough to
ask Levy for a copy.</TE>
<TE>   Parcells, who coached that Giants team to another Super Bowl
victory, is considered the king of mind games. Johnson, who coached
the Dallas Cowboys to two Super Bowl wins, was equally deft at
manipulating situations and circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing intuitively what to say and when to say it is vital.</TE>
<TE>   Raven Coach Brian Billick has the knack. His routine is to present
a theme early in the week and reinforce it daily. He has shown clips
from movies like "Saving Private Ryan" and "Wise Guys" and called
players out. He tries to avoid leaning on an emotional angle too
often.</TE>
<TE>   "In the pro level, if you're having to manufacture too much of
that as a coach, then you've got other problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "All you're trying to do is elicit a certain intellectual and
emotional and physical response, to heighten their senses about
whatever it is you're doing -- the teaching sequence, the moment, the
veracity of the game. And you have to be careful. When I use these
clips and such, you can overdo it. It can become trite."</TE>
<TE>   Billick was anything but trite before the Super Bowl two seasons
ago. As he had been throughout the 2000 season, he was masterful
setting the stage for the Ravens' 34-7 rout of the Giants.
"Appreciate the moment" was his theme.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let a moment of this escape you," he told them, "and for
God's sake, don't let yourself for a second escape the point. You
don't want to look back and go, 'Damn, I didn't give everything I
had. I didn't have the focus I needed.' "</TE>
<TE>   Veteran players appreciate Billick's approach. Defensive end
Michael McCrary has had four coaches in 10 seasons, from Tom Flores
and Dennis Erickson in Seattle to Ted Marchibroda and Billick in
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "Ted was more of a rah-rah coach," McCrary said. "He was like,
'C'mon guys, let's go get it.' He was more old-school. Billick has
more of a business approach. He makes his points and he doesn't
scream at you; he's just very direct and passionate."</TE>
<TE>   A critical part of leading, Newsome said, is knowing the makeup of
your team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to understand the pulse of the team, where the
team is," he said. "If you've got a veteran team, ranting and raving
probably is not going to get it done; it's not going to move those
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Asked which coach was the best speaker they ever heard, Newsome
and Harris named their college coaches -- Bear Bryant at Alabama and
Eddie Robinson at Grambling.</TE>
<TE>   It was left to Harris to draw the bottom line on locker-room
oratory.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in the room with a group of players and they need this
speech to be successful," he said, "then you're going to lose."</TE>

<LD>Locker room speeches cover a wide range of topics and situations.
Here are a few examples of some memorable NFL speeches:</LD>
<LD>   * During his brief tenure with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 1996,
wide receiver Andre Rison took exception to a speech made by Coach
Tom Coughlin before a game against New England. Coughlin warned the
Jaguars about Dave Meggett, and said they would keep the game close
until the fourth quarter, when they would win it.</LD>
<LD>   When Coughlin finished, Rison reportedly stood up and said:
"Forget that (expletive). We're going to kick their (expletive) in
the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter and the fourth
quarter. And (expletive) Dave Meggett. We can crush him like a little
flea."</LD>
<TE>   The players loved Rison's talk, but lost in overtime, 28-25.</TE>
<TE>   * Chuck Noll rarely gave speeches as coach of the Pittsburgh
Steelers and still won four Super Bowls. One of his best, though,
came before a Monday night game in Oakland in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing commitment, Noll told the players that the Spartans
were so committed to victory that when they sailed to the island of
Corinth to fight the Corinthians, they burned their own ships; the
only way they could return was with a victory, on Corinthian ships.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers lost, 30-27, and finished the year 8-8.</TE>
<TE>   * New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells kept his talk brief and to
the point before the team's first Super Bowl after the 1986 season.
Parcells stressed that the players were finally where they wanted to
be. "You're finally here. You may never have the opportunity again,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants crushed the Denver Broncos, 39-20, in Super Bowl XXI.</TE>

<DH>Golf's original bad boy is one of six inductees in World
Hall of Fame</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Whitley</AU>
<BD>Orlando Sentinel</BD>
<DL>LECANTO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The hands that launched a thousand golf clubs aren't what they used
to be. They're still large and strong, but 86 years of hard use has
taken a toll.</LD>
<LD>   "I still play, but I don't have as much touch," said Tommy Bolt,
who was one of six inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame in St.
Augustine Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "And your fingertips are where your touch is."</LD>
<TE>   Carpal tunnel syndrome or not, the 1958 U.S. Open champion can
shoot the age of a man 10 years younger. As for throwing the clubs,
the truth got lost in the myth long ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Bolt Volcano never really sent a thousand clubs spewing like
lava into the air over the PGA. It only seemed that way, thanks
primarily to the showman who knew a good thing when he threw it. If
there was a downside, it was that a terrific golfer became famous for
being terrible.</TE>
<TE>   If Bolt had a penny for every time he has been asked about being a
golfing madman, he could buy Black Diamond Ranch, the renowned golf
enclave that employs him as its resident legend. If he had $10 for
every time he was remembered for what he did between club tosses, he
barely could afford a ticket into the Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   That changed Saturday night when Bolt finally got in for free.
Well, there was a price.</TE>
<TE>   "I did it the hard way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Golf's original bad boy would like you to note that nobody gets
into the Hall of Fame based on how far they could heave a 5-iron.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt won 15 tournaments, played on two U.S. Ryder Cup teams,
missed only six cuts in two decades and for years held the tour
single-round scoring record of 60.</TE>
<TE>   But what about the club throwing?</TE>
<TE>   "All that was blown out of proportion," Bolt said.</TE>
<TE>   He almost won the 1971 PGA Championship when he was 55 and was
instrumental in igniting the Senior PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   But what about the club throwing?</TE>
<TE>   "Like I'm the only one who ever threw a club," Bolt said.</TE>
<TE>   He long ago learned to live and laugh with the image monster he
created. It doesn't take long to see Thunder Bolt is actually as
cheerful as a crystal blue sky. He and his wife, Mary Lou, split time
between their ranch in Arkansas and Black Diamond.</TE>
<TE>   If schmoozing prospective members is a chore, it's one Bolt was
born to do. The next woman who passes by and doesn't give him a peck
on the cheek will be the first. Bolt still sets the fashion standard,
with shined shoes and a golf shirt buttoned to the top.</TE>
<TE>   He can spin stories for hours, recalling bets, shots and
personalities from 75 years ago. The one thing he cannot recall is
throwing a club and wishing he could have it back.</TE>
<TE>   "Not that I can remember," Bolt said.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't try merely to shoot low scores; he wanted to hit
artistic shots. Bolt swears his perfectionist's temper got the best
of him only a handful of times, like at the 1960 U.S. Open, when he
sent a club whirling into a lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who's never thrown a club is not serious about the game,"
Bolt said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of his heaves were mainly for show, providing the kind of
spice today's tour has been accused of lacking. Bolt can't help
shaking his head over how things have changed, from the souped-up
equipment to the courtesy cars to the traveling PGA masseuse, who's
needed to help relieve sore muscles after pros pick up their
gargantuan 15th-place paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   "Most kids today are loaded," Bolt said. "Let me tell you, it does
make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   He took a bus to his first tournament in Montgomery, Ala. He
stayed at the YMCA and made $170.</TE>
<TE>   Bolt has the usual modern-day laments, but he's not the bitter old
codger angry over being born too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no. I'm happy with what happened," he said. "I did it the
hard way, but I'm happy."</TE>
<TE>   His satisfaction was never complete until today. Bolt made no
secret he wanted to get into the Hall of Fame, but he'd been bypassed
for years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the ultimate, man," he said. "There's nothing bigger."</TE>

<AU>Michael Wilbon</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than once I've criticized NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman in this
space for what I felt was turning a blind eye toward gratuitous
violence that reduces the sport. So let me applaud him and his
sergeant-at-arms Colin Campbell for suspending New York Ranger Coach
Brian Trottier for two games this week for essentially precipitating
a brawl by sending a lineup full of goons out for the final 2.8
seconds of a game.</LD>
<LD>   With nothing left in a 6-3 loss but a neutral-zone faceoff,
Trottier sent Krzysztof Oliwa, Sandy McCarthy and Matt Barnaby onto
the ice, and trust me that nobody will ever confuse these three with
Gretzky, Howe and Orr. And what did Trottier's goons do in those
final 2.8 seconds of Saturday night's game in Columbus? They thugged
it up. Oliwa crosschecked Grant Marshall the instant the puck was
dropped, despite being warned by referee Kerry Fraser that the league
would "throw the book" at him if he did anything.</LD>
<TE>   Campbell, obviously with Bettman's blessing, suspended Oliwa for
five games, Trottier for two games. Fabulous. None of the parties
involved are talking about the brawl or the discipline handed out.
But Bettman said in several different interviews last Thursday and
Friday that fighting is down across the league, which it is. And one
way to reduced it even further is to suspend not just the goon, but
the coach who keeps him around, dispatches him to do the vile work
that's still to some extent embraced in the culture of the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   I like hockey. I hate hockey fighting. Anything that takes one's
eye away from the skill and artistry of the best players in the
world, in my mind, undermines the product. I find it hard to work up
any real sympathy for the Washington Capitals that they will be
without their primary fighter, Stephen Peat, for the next month or so
because his right hand needs surgery, probably because he has thrown
more punches with it in the last few weeks than Lennox Lewis. In the
Washington Post on Tuesday, Jason La Canfora's story on Peat's injury
was entirely about fighting. The really encouraging news to me in
that story is that the Capitals, even though they recently traded
tough-guy Chris Simon to Chicago, apparently aren't looking to deal
for a fighter and don't have one in the minors. Imagine that, they
could use an actual skilled player on the roster in place of Peat!</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if the Capitals' skill guys start getting pounded over
the next few weeks before Peat returns, George McPhee is going to
feel his players are at a disadvantage and therefore he is compelled
to get an enforcer. Alex Henry, the 6-foot-6 wingman who could be
converted to defense, might want to keep himself warm in the bullpen.
(To show you what the Rangers really think of Oliwa, the Rangers sent
him home even though he is allowed to practice while under
suspension. Maybe that's because Oliwa doesn't need a rink to
practice, he needs a speed bag and Emanuel Steward.)</TE>
<TE>   No, I'm not naive enough to think fighting is going to disappear
from the NHL, even though it serves no purpose, and it's the only
sport anywhere that sanctions fighting. Guys are still going to drop
the gloves and fight, and many more people within the NHL seem to
want it that way than not. Jarome Iginla, last year's leading goal
scorer, was widely applauded for fighting last week. There's a whole
underground network of hockey fight tapes that are absolutely prized.
But Bettman's effort to clean up the game and put the emphasis on the
skill, speed and beauty of the game shouldn't go unnoticed. The
number of relatively unskilled goons is down, with all apologies to
Edmonton's George Laraque, the reigning NHL tough-guy. The Bob
Proberts and Marty McSorleys -- hired pieces of meat -- are
thankfully becoming extinct.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the NHL isn't exactly moving closer to the Olympic-style
of game that many of us find superior and more engaging, Bettman's
suspension of Trottier sends a message of intolerance for
premeditated fighting. Actually, the NHL had already told team
executives that there would be zero-tolerance of situations where one
team goes after another at the end of a lopsided game. So Bettman and
Campbell, when they suspended Trottier, were only backing up what
they'd already told the clubs.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a reach to pop the Rangers and Trottier. Oliwa was sent
out on the ice with 2.8 seconds left specifically to tag somebody. It
had happened earlier against Tampa Bay. I wonder how much Trottier
was egged on by his assistants, tough guys Jim Schoenfeld and Terry
O'Reilly, yes, the former Bruins fighter. You can smell these
end-of-game, we've-got-no-chance-to-win-but-we're-going-show-you
situations a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   While I'm in, apparently, that small percentage of people who
wants fighting eliminated altogether, it's clear that ridding the
game of obviously gratuitous fights, premeditated brawls provoked by
coaches and the clutching and grabbing offenses that tend to obscure
the brilliance of the world's best players goes a long way toward
improving the NHL's product, as long as Bettman and Campbell keep the
heat on the offenders.</TE>

<HD>Bulger Proves Martz's Worth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ram Coach Mike Martz finds himself without a great quarterback,
he simply creates one.</LD>
<LD>   Against the Chicago Bears Monday night, he will show off his new
quarterback, Marc Bulger, who has won four straight while
pinch-hitting for the old, Kurt Warner.</LD>
<LD>   But even Warner -- the NFL's reigning most valuable player, a
two-timer, in fact -- never had a day like Bulger's last Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Four of Bulger's better passes were caught, but fumbled away, two
of them returned for spectacular San Diego touchdowns. Then, throwing
four touchdown passes that were held -- completing pass-play drives
of 85, 88, 94 and 54 yards -- Bulger came back to win, 28-24.
Clearly, the new model is, like the old model, something special.</TE>
<TE>   From 0-4 to 4-0</TE>
<TE>   The creation of two superior pro quarterbacks, in succession, is
so difficult and unusual that Martz has had few predecessors. One was
Bill Walsh of San Francisco, who built the NFL's only five-time Super
Bowl champion with a third-round draft pick, Joe Montana, and a
castoff quarterback from Tampa Bay, Steve Young.</TE>
<TE>   In the NFL's only other comparable two-quarterback scene, Bob
Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin led the old Los Angeles Rams to the
championship one day half a century ago, when Hamp Pool was the
offensive coordinator under Coach Joe Stydahar.</TE>
<TE>   On that team, owner Dan Reeves drafted Van Brocklin after he
already had Waterfield</TE>
<TE>   On this team, the coaches began with an Arena League graduate,
Warner, and a free agent named Jamie Martin, a potential star who had
been cut first by Jacksonville and then by Cleveland before he was
cut by Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Both quarterbacks soon went down with injuries as the Rams fell to
0-5 this fall with most of the same players who, earlier this year,
had reached the Super Bowl -- where they lost in the last two
minutes, after having won the Super Bowl championship two winters
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams were ready with a third quarterback, Bulger, a former
sixth-round draft pick who had been cut by New Orleans and Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Martz had used Bulger in every exhibition game, taking the time
after each to go over the fine points of the incomparable Martz
system with a third-stringer. The Rams finished the summer 0-4 -- but
who cares about the exhibition record? Martz, improbable as it seems,
had another quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   He's No. 1</TE>
<TE>   There are two reasons to think of Martz as the nation's finest
football coach of the last 20 years or so, since at least Walsh.
First, he developed those two successful, winning quarterbacks
consecutively.</TE>
<TE>   Other coaches have been hard put to get one. The league is full of
passers who can't win a Super Bowl -- or even four consecutive
regular-season games.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Martz's teams have scored more than 500 points in three
successive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Before this coach came to the Rams, only two teams had ever
exceeded 500 points in one schedule of games, the 1983 Redskins and
1998 Vikings -- and neither could do it more than once.</TE>
<TE>   Thus if San Francisco's Young is the NFL's No. 1 all-time passer
because he has the highest passing rating, Martz is the league's
all-time No. 1 offensive coach because the record is there to show
it.</TE>
<TE>   Passing Wins</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Rams' three big seasons consecutively (1999-2001),
Martz started 2002 with hordes of critics. Misunderstanding or
underestimating pass offense after all the Rams have done with the
thrown ball in his time, they keep saying he should run it with
Marshall Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   Although Martz's pass offense had been primary in achieving
records of 13-3, 10-6, and 14-2 in the last three seasons, they keep
saying he lost the Super Bowl game because he wouldn't run Faulk.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, Warner's passes had the Rams in a 17-17 tie in the
last two minutes, when it was New England quarterback Tom Brady's
surprise passing attack that won it, 20-17.</TE>
<TE>   There was further evidence that the Ram coaches are on the right
track against San Diego last Sunday, when the catalyst,
unfortunately, was an injury. On the fourth play of the fourth
quarter, Faulk, who is perhaps the premier pass-catching halfback of
all time, went down with a game-ending leg problem.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, the Rams were losing, 24-14, but if Faulk's injury
should have doomed his team, it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Freed from the necessity to prove anything to anybody but himself,
Martz, through the rest of the fourth quarter, called one pass after
another, as he used to do.</TE>
<TE>   And Bulger completed them all -- except a spike and a throwaway or
two -- to turn a 24-14 San Diego lead into a 28-24 Ram win.</TE>
<TE>   QB Controversy?</TE>
<TE>   The lesson for Monday night possibly, and on through the remainder
of the schedule, is that Martz is more likely to succeed if, instead
of heeding other people, he hears only Martz.</TE>
<TE>   That has proved hard to do in the Rams' last three starts, when on
many occasions Martz called Faulk's number when in his system a pass
was the percentage call.</TE>
<TE>   The critics, in other words, have been influencing the coach. It
gets increasingly harder to ignore them the louder they shout.</TE>
<TE>   Next up, almost certainly, is a Warner-Bulger quarterback
controversy, as generated in part by Martz critics and in part by the
nature of football. A quarterback controversy always makes a great
story. So the coach is on the spot again, this one perhaps a no-win
spot. He can get off it only by listening just to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Brains and Courage</TE>
<TE>   Here are three reasons most NFL coaches have been reluctant to
throw, even though Knute Rockne, Sid Gillman, Walsh, Martz and a few
others have shown them how:</TE>
<TE>   * It takes an intelligent designer to draw up good pass plays,
whereas dummies can persistently run the ball. For 83 years, NFL
running-play advocates have used the same three simple-minded running
plays: off-tackle, around end, or into the line. On the Ram team,
Martz has designed hundreds of pass plays.</TE>
<TE>   * It takes an extra helping of self-confidence for a passing coach
to disregard the potential for interceptions. When an interception or
two costs him the lead, or possibly a game, a one-word explanation
will come instantly from almost every bar in town, not to mention
every TV set -- "Turnovers." Everything else the coach might do all
day, good and bad, and everything else his team does, good or bad,
will be forgotten while the critics constantly and thoughtlessly
repeat, "Turnovers."</TE>
<TE>   * Above all, it takes more courage than most people have to face
down the critics who gather like vultures whenever, for any reason,
pass plays fail.</TE>
<TE>   It's much safer to run. If you run and fail, it's the players who
screwed up, not the coaching staff. Or so the media analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Five Choices</TE>
<TE>   As NFL results get more unpredictable, here are five guesses on
this week's big games:</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco to win by one or two points over San Diego at
Qualcomm Stadium, site of this winter's Super Bowl: Two good
California teams can both run and pass, but the 49ers are deeper into
the habit of winning.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans by three over Atlanta at the Georgia Dome: In a battle
of impressive young quarterbacks, the Saints' Aaron Brooks is more
experienced in the art of rising to big games than Michael Vick,
though Vick, the favorite this week, beat him last time at the
Superdome</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City over Buffalo by a touchdown at Arrowhead Stadium,
where the Chiefs will hold their own in passing and will outrun the
Bills.</TE>
<TE>   New England over favored Oakland by a touchdown at Network
Associates Coliseum: In a replay of last winter's controversial Snow
Bowl, the Raiders would like to get even but have shown only
intermittently that they can play that well.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis by eight over Chicago at the Edward Jones Dome: In the
Monday nighter, the Bears will exhibit the tools to disrupt the Ram
defense but not the will for intelligent play calling.</TE>

<LD>Is chivalry dead? Not for Sir Edward Artis, self-styled Knight of
Malta. The Vietnam paramedic-turned-humanitarian swashbuckler has
spent 30-plus years taking donated food, medicine and other supplies
into the planet's hairiest hot spots. Be it Kosovo, Rwanda, Chechnya
or Afghanistan, the nonprofit Knightsbridge International, of which
Artis is a member, is over the border before more bureaucratic
nongovernmental organizations have drafted their proposals. An
upcoming documentary feature by Adrian Belic tracks the group in
Afghanistan and the Philippines and along the Thailand-Myanmar
border. We spoke to Artis, 57, on a stopover at his West Hills home.</LD>
<LD>   What is the deal with the Knights of Malta?</LD>
<LD>   I was knighted in 1993 [by] a group from the U.S. that wanted to
reestablish the order in Russia [formed during the 11th century by
the Catholic Church, the order splintered during the late 1700s. A
Catholic order continues today, but there are dozens of self-styled
groups, some focusing on charitable work]. I was invited to join for
work I'd done with Afghan war veterans in Russia.</LD>
<TE>   How did you get into this work?</TE>
<TE>   I was a paramedic in Vietnam, and we did what they called MEDCAPs,
the Medical Civic Action Program. I left the army in 1973. In 1992, I
went to Russia to do a documentary on the Soviet involvement in
Vietnam. That's when I met the Afghan veterans. They had nothing, and
I knew I could get stuff like prostheses and hospital equipment. When
Chernobyl happened, I sent oncology meds. I know how to scrounge. I'm
a good pack rat.</TE>
<TE>   Obvious question: How do you ensure that aid reaches its
destination?</TE>
<TE>   "Hand to hand, eye to eye, heart to heart." That's a little
slogan. You do it in small enough increments. The individual and the
food, the blankets, the tents, the clothing. The manner in which we
do it, very little is going to get sold. [Though] if a father trades
wheat for medicine or something to feed his family, who am I to
belittle him?</TE>
<TE>   How do you decide who to help? There is misery all over the
planet.</TE>
<TE>   It depends on what is available. What I don't want, and a lot of
people that run these agencies have, are warehouses. [My garage] is
my warehouse. I have two pallets of medicine coming worth about a
million bucks. They only have like nine months left on them. [If] I
can get to somebody that needs those quickly, that's going to
predicate where we'll go.</TE>
<TE>   What about skimming once you're there?</TE>
<TE>   They always try to skim. You have to finesse. When we go to
Afghanistan, we'll have 10-30 bodyguards for the convoy. We feed
them. We make sure they have shoes. We pay their salaries. We also
give them an equal amount of food at the end of the mission. That way
they are part of the team. Nobody works for us. They work with us.</TE>
<TE>   Could anybody get rice, get on a plane to Afghanistan and hand it
out?</TE>
<TE>   You could if you wanted to.Those who want to go, find an NGO that
will take them. But know that nobody is going to pay you to go.</TE>
<TE>   There's been much talk of evil since the 9/11 events. What is your
definition?</TE>
<TE>   Evil is when women and children and elderly are caught in the
crossfire and people will not make a move to get them out of the way.
A little battle of knuckles now and then is not a bad thing, but you
don't want a lot of collateral damage. That's evil to me.</TE>
<TE>   What is the biggest factor putting people in dire straits?</TE>
<TE>   Poverty. I'd like to see redistribution of wealth and access to
information and education for everybody. I would love to put Internet
cafes all over the world. Solar-powered kiosks where somebody could
read a book or a newspaper. Or the Bible or Koran or whatever they
want. Ignorance and poverty are the major problems in the world
today.</TE>
<TE>   What about Iraq? Do you have an opinion on the U.S. position?</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I think we should be there. Look, he's never lived up to his
1991 treaty. We keep rattling our sabers with Saddam Hussein, he's
going to move his assets. We did it in Afghanistan. For a month, we
watched [U.S.] aircraft fly over and drop one bomb. By delaying the
full air attack, we allowed the Taliban and Al Qaeda to seep out. The
next thaw in Afghanistan, we'll start to lose American soldiers. The
Taliban and Al Qaeda are in the mountains. The same thing is going to
happen to Iraq. I'd rather err on the side of us than see another
9/11. The streets in the U.S. will be like Jerusalem if we are not
careful.</TE>
<TE>   You're not a peacenik then.</TE>
<TE>   No. I can wage war as equally as peace. But we're the voice for
those who have none. That's why I want to be in Iraq now, preparing
the civil affairs side. You have to reconstruct, to deny the people
you displaced an opportunity to come back in. The only way is to show
people you made a change for the better. You didn't wash your hands
and leave. I think U.S. policies in Afghanistan are grossly flawed.
We abandoned Afghanistan in 1989 and allowed it to be a petri dish
where Taliban and Al Qaeda could germinate. We ended up paying for it
on Sept. 11 and we're not done paying yet.</TE>
<TE>   What do you carry on a mission?</TE>
<TE>   I have one rucksack [with a] solar panel that will power my
laptop. We have a sat phone that does videos. We keep our Web site
up. If [you] can watch a turtle give birth in Costa Rica, I want
people to follow us. Not just to see the tragedy, but to see part of
the solution.</TE>

<HD>NOBEL LAUREATE FRANCIS H.C. CRICK DISCOVERED DNA. NOW HE'S
HUNTING FOR THE VERY ESSENCE OF OUR BEING--THE SOURCE OF CONSCIOUS
THOUGHT.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL A. HILTZIK</AU>
<BD>Michael A. Hiltzik is a Times staff writer. He last
wrote for the magazine about the dispute over screenwriting credits
for the film "Spider-Man."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His gait is slower now, his voice no longer quite as resonant as the
one that used to dominate conversation in sitting rooms around
Cambridge, England, in the 1950s, proclaiming his colleagues' errors
and oversights and attracting attention like a magnet drawing iron.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood" was James D.
Watson's appraisal of his research partner in the famous opening line
of "The Double Helix," his 1968 memoir of the quest that turned these
two young scientists into household names. But time has moderated, if
scarcely stilled, the braying laugh that Watson depicted as so
penetrating that eminent scientists would flee when they heard it
coming down the hall. And Crick's famous habit of haunting other
peoples' labs and discerning the importance of their discoveries
before they did themselves has diminished, in large part because, at
age 86, Crick finds it hard to get around much anymore.</LD>
<LD>   "It pays to sit in on experiments," he says a little wistfully
from the dining room of his La Jolla home. "I do go across when I
can" to laboratories at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies,
where he is president emeritus, and to nearby UC San Diego. "When you
go to experimental labs you pick up things about what they're doing
that you won't otherwise."</LD>
<TE>   But the traits that made Francis H.C. Crick one of the preeminent
theorists of modern science--not to mention one of its premier
intellectual provocateurs--are still evident. There is his gleeful
pleasure in worrying a scientific problem until it begins to yield,
his eagerness to engage experts in a wide range of fields on
questions likely to cross the artificial boundaries of individual
disciplines, his constant reminders that the role of hypothesis in
science is not to isolate an experiment from unexpected paths of
inquiry but to provide a rough road map through a murky landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Today, four decades after having won a Nobel Prize and a permanent
place in the pantheon of biology for helping to explicate the ancient
structure of DNA (the double helix of Watson's book title), Francis
Crick is devoting his robust mind to solving a riddle of biology
emerging from the opposite end of the evolutionary scale. His goal is
to identify the physical basis--the "neural correlate" in scientific
terminology--of the very quality that separates humankind from
animals and machines: consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two decades, Crick has become one of the most prolific
theorists of this search. In articles, many co-written with Caltech
professor Christof Koch, Crick has exhorted his colleagues to explore
the physical mechanisms that make us thinking individuals.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the Crick-Koch hypothesis is a simple idea with
vast implications. It is that consciousness, rather than representing
some spiritual or God-given quality, is a biological process like
digestion or circulation, generated by the activity of neurons in the
brain. As he wrote in his 1994 book, "The Astonishing Hypothesis":
"You, your joys and your sorrows--your sense of personal identity and
free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly
of nerve cells and their associated molecules."</TE>
<TE>   Those words have energized a generation of scientists delving into
how neurons communicate with each other and with other structures in
the brain and the body. They have produced an explosion of interest
in how the electrochemical impulses of millions of organic cells
generate images, ideas, desires and memories. "What we've done is
make the problem respectable," Crick says, padding around his home,
his gangly frame shrouded within a bright knit cardigan. "We nag
people."</TE>
<TE>   That's an appropriate way to put it, because within academic
circles the scientific study of consciousness was until recently a
hard sell. In 1951, when Crick and Watson launched their study of
DNA, some molecular biologists thought that the search for the
molecular structure was reasonable and the goal attainable. By 1953,
DNA's role in carrying genetic information was understood in
principle, and several research teams at major universities were
racing to decipher its code. Watson later admitted in "The Double
Helix" that he assumed that the victors would win the Nobel Prize.</TE>
<TE>   Consciousness is different. Crick acknowledges that consciousness
is bound to be a far more complex quarry than DNA. "There are lots of
bits of business to explain," he says cheerfully, relishing the sheer
intricacy of the quest. "Aesthetic responses to things, long-term
plans and so on. The double helix was simple because it goes back to
the very beginning of life, when things had to be simple. But
consciousness is the product of millions of years of evolution."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, consciousness remained the exclusive province of
philosophers and theologians. They often appealed to concepts such as
God or "spirit" to explain the distinction between physical
phenomena--say, plant growth or digestion--and mental phenomena such
as memory and emotion.</TE>
<TE>   Among scientists, the subject of consciousness carried the scent
of the disreputable, similar to studying alchemy or ESP. In academia
it was the surest route off the tenure track. Early on, Crick ran up
against this prejudice. "An interest in the topic was usually taken
as a sign of approaching senility," he recalled in a 1988 memoir.
Crick thought it deplorable that science might admit that any
physical process was too complicated for scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   Part of his determination derived from the importance of the
subject. In the words of Berkeley philosopher John Searle,
consciousness is "central ... in the understanding of our very
existence as human beings." It plays a role in every phenomenon by
which we define our individuality. It includes what it means to see
red, feel thirsty, recall the pain of touching a hot grill, suffer
grief, find the humor in a pratfall or the joy in love--subjective
perceptions that scientists call "qualia." It is what enables a
person to assemble a chaos of sights, sounds and smells into the
unified perception of an environment, whether kitchen, coal cellar or
glade, and distinguish where one's body stops and the rest of that
world begins. Or to recognize the face of an aunt or a boss and
summon up the appropriate greeting; to decide whether to walk or take
a bus; to judge one's position on a baseball diamond to intercept a
batted ball; to plan a shopping trip, a route through the park or a
strategy on the battlefield. It is what enables you to read this
paragraph, pause, and contemplate what it means to be thinking about
thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Consciousness is slower than instinct or reflex but capable of
coordinating the actions of a larger number of physical systems. It
may be the ultimate example of how nature, starting with the building
blocks of biology, can create something of almost infinite
complexity.</TE>
<TE>   An early obstacle for scientists was the attempt to define
consciousness. By some reckonings there are as many layers of
consciousness as there are colors in the spectrum. At the most
rudimentary level, consciousness can be regarded as simple awareness
of occurrences in the world, perhaps combined with a limited memory
that enables animals to respond to novel situations by applying prior
knowledge. Researchers have argued that many species can be
considered conscious by this definition--ranging from honeybees,
which follow their hive mates' "waggle dance" as though aware it
leads to food, to dogs who apply their awareness of the difference
between strangers and family members to know when to bark out a
warning at the approach of intruders.</TE>
<TE>   Humans use the same low-order capabilities to layer meaning onto
otherwise random events. "When you touch something hot and pull your
hand away, that's a spinal reflex," observes Joseph Bogen, a clinical
professor of neurosurgery at USC and visiting professor at Caltech
who specializes in split-brain research. "But it's almost always
accompanied by a sensation of pain, long after the limb is pulled
back." Yet if reflex alone can rescue a limb from danger, why the
pain? The answer, Bogen argues, is that consciousness of pain "helps
you to learn something that you would not otherwise learn as fast or
as well: The next time you're near the stove, you don't touch it."</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the consciousness scale is what theorists call
"higher-order thought"--the self-awareness most people think of as
true consciousness. This includes the ability to reflect on one's
thoughts and perceptions, to embed them within intricate mental webs
of memories and concepts, and to communicate them. Decoding this
level of consciousness is "at once the most familiar thing in the
world and the most mysterious," writes David Chalmers, a philosophy
professor and director of the Center for Consciousness Studies at the
University of Arizona. It represents the biggest intellectual
challenge for philosophers and scientists alike, with some arguing
that it may never yield to human understanding.</TE>
<TE>   One of Crick's most important contributions to the debate has been
persuading scientists to set aside temporarily their desire to define
the type of consciousness that they are trying to isolate and just
start looking. "As a tactical matter it would seem best to discover a
lot more" about the neural correlate before trying to refine the
search, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "The most valuable thing I ever learned from Francis Crick is not
to get mired down in debate but just to focus on what you can agree
on," says Bogen, who has devoted much of his 76 years to studying the
brain. "If consciousness is everything that everyone wants to apply
that word to, the search is hopeless." Bogen interrupts dinner at a
Chinese restaurant to hold a teapot aloft. "Almost everybody in this
room would agree that this teapot is not conscious. And everyone
would agree that everyone in this room is conscious. So there's a
reasonable amount of agreement about what we're searching for."</TE>
<TE>   He unfurls a napkin and marks it with a network of interlocking
circles, each representing someone's pet definition of consciousness.
Then he indicates the space at the center that falls within every
circle. This common element is composed of the subjective perceptions
called "qualia"--the sense of red as red, the smell of a jacaranda as
a floral perfume or the sun striking our bare arms as a layering on
of heat. "That's the crucial, central core of the many various
concepts of consciousness," Bogen says.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers already have identified physical manifestations of
some phenomena related to consciousness. They have found, for
example, that the neural patterns differ when one is viewing an image
subconsciously and when one is "seeing" it--actually paying
attention. In both cases an image is striking the retina, but only in
the latter can a subject describe it. Neurons in parts of the brain
also appear to fire in different patterns depending on whether
someone is viewing a scene or merely recollecting it (in the mind's
eye, so to speak).</TE>
<TE>   These are rudimentary phenomena. Finding the key to higher-level
thought is what beckons many scientists in this fledgling discipline.
Some argue that as we learn more we will gain a new conception of
what it means to be human. Neuroscientists are contemplating the
implications of research suggesting that our emotions and
personalities are largely manifestations of impersonal
electrochemical events in the brain: If we demystify the image of
ourselves as entities with free will, if we banish from our culture a
conception of the human soul as something spiritual, what kind of
people will we become?</TE>
<TE>   Others are starting to consider the ethical and legal questions
that could be raised if we learn how to manipulate conscious states.
When knowledge of consciousness provides insights into the mechanisms
of decision-making, perception and emotion, how much will we be
tempted to fix what we consider broken or to "beautify" modes of
thinking that are no longer fashionable? Could mental engineering, in
the words of the German researcher Thomas Metzinger, "reduce the
number of ways acceptable to be a person"? If we conclude that
elements of human nature such as moral choice are not the result of a
spiritual communion with God and society but the outcome of a
hard-wired biology, what will keep us from trying to rewire the
system?</TE>
<TE>   There might have been no better candidate to move the subject of
consciousness out of the metaphysical world and into the empirical
than Francis Crick. Born in 1916 to churchgoing but not especially
devout Protestants near Northampton, England, he found himself
pondering the incompatibility of science and religion at an early
age, and ever after wore his hostility toward religion and philosophy
like a badge.</TE>
<TE>   "At exactly which point I lost my early religious faith I am not
clear," he wrote, "but it was almost certainly before the actual
onset of puberty." To this day, he sprinkles his daily banter with
reminders of his antipathy toward philosophers, lest anyone forget
that only science holds the key to ultimate truths.</TE>
<TE>   In person, Francis Crick is hardly the figure summarized by Watson
in that famous introduction. The tall, slightly stooped figure
greeting a visitor to his home exudes charm and an eagerness to
engage in dialogue. Silence is scarce in a conversation with him,
which is an outpouring of ideas and observations and a challenge to
hold up your end of the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   In his memoirs, Crick suggests that Watson misconstrued as
immodesty what was really a habit of thinking aloud, an unconstrained
emission of ideas expressed "unduly loquaciously." Crick maintains
that although his opinions often prove correct in time, they are not
always meant as the last word. Rather, they are notions to be
pondered, perhaps by more acute minds than his. "For solving protein
structures, my point of view was bound to emerge in the long run," he
wrote. "By giving my colleagues a very necessary jolt--all I did was
help create an atmosphere in which it happened a little sooner."</TE>
<TE>   Unsurprisingly, these colleagues were often less than grateful.
When Crick contradicted the presenters during a postwar Cambridge
University colloquium on X-ray crystallography, a topic in which he
was a novice, he was charged with the ultimate breach of decorum by a
senior scientist: "Crick, you're rocking the boat."</TE>
<TE>   Crick had come to the study of X-ray crystallography by a
circuitous route. He says he was never one of those prodigies who
settled on his life's work at a tender age. He was an intellectual
vagabond, trying on various subjects and gauging his interest by the
"gossip test." Whatever topic he gossiped about most was the one that
interested him most. From time to time he would be cornered by
circumstance into concentrating on one field, and he invariably
excelled. Duties during World War II, for example, brought him to a
physics lab, where he developed magnetic mines that wreaked havoc on
enemy fleets.</TE>
<TE>   War's end found him searching again, his only guidepost a rather
broad question. "In the old days I asked myself about very mysterious
problems, such as the difference between living things and
nonliving," Crick says. Part of the appeal of such arcane study was
that it seemed far beyond the scope of modern science. "It was widely
believed by educated people at the time that the problems were
insoluble."</TE>
<TE>   The question led to two disciplines: neurobiology, the study of
the brain, and molecular biology, the study of the simplest
components of life.</TE>
<TE>   Neurobiology was at an embryonic stage. Molecular biology, at
least, was beginning to solve the riddle of protein synthesis and
organization. So he and Watson, his Cambridge research partner,
turned their attention to DNA, the chromosomal protein that was known
to play a critical role in genetics. Working with the
crystallographers Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, Crick and
Watson discovered the helical structure of DNA in 1953, an
achievement for which they and Wilkins won the 1962 Nobel Prize in
physiology and medicine. (Franklin had succumbed to cancer in 1958.)</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Crick dabbled in several fields. As he later wrote, he
had started working in molecular biology on the assumption that most
of its major questions would outlast his professional life. Instead,
by the mid-1960s, most had been solved, including the makeup of the
gene and the secrets of its functioning. He toyed with embryology and
then with speculations that life on earth had originated from
microorganisms sent "by a higher civilization elsewhere," a theory he
described as "directed panspermia" in a 1981 book, "Life Itself."</TE>
<TE>   But the gossip test told him his interest was the brain. Having
accepted a permanent appointment at the Salk Institute, he decided
that determining the physical basis of consciousness would become his
new life's work.</TE>
<TE>   What he found was a field that had been all but cowed by
philosophical speculation. The 17th century French intellectual Rene
Descartes had staked out the so-called "dualist" position,
distinguishing between the body, which was the repository of all
things physical, and the mind, which was an ineffable something else.
For the next 300 years, anyone who tried to probe the nature of
"mind" labored under what might be called the curse of Descartes. You
could study the body as a physical manifestation or the mind as the
manifestation of an animating spirit, but you could bridge the gulf
between them only by appealing to metaphysics.</TE>
<TE>   A wall stood between consciousness and empirical science. If
consciousness could not be defined except through first-person
reports of subjective phenomena, then it could hardly be an
appropriate study for scientists, who were trained to focus only on
phenomena that could be observed and verified.</TE>
<TE>   Crick was not dissuaded. He chose to begin by studying vision. The
mechanics of vision, how light works on the rods and cones of the eye
and is transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve, had been solved.
The areas of the cerebral cortex involved in processing visual
messages had been located. But obviously there was more to "seeing"
than that. "What [was] not yet understood, is how the brain puts all
this together to give us our vivid unitary picture of the world,"
Crick wrote in 1988. This was consciousness, "which one was not
supposed to mention."</TE>
<TE>   Crick's first public stab at the subject appeared in a 1979
Scientific American article. He had reached several important
conclusions. One was that the study of perception tended to be
clouded by subjectivity, which misled researchers into believing that
processes such as vision were simpler than they are. What a person
senses subjectively when he or she sees, hears, smells or feels is
only the output of neurological processes; the processes themselves
take place unconsciously. "Our capacity for deceiving ourselves about
the operation of our brain is almost limitless, mainly because what
we can report is only a minute fraction of what goes on in our head,"
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But that fraction, like everything else, was still the outcome of
processes that "involve large numbers of neurons interacting in
intricate ways." There was no reason, he concluded, that this
neuronal interaction could not be the subject of experimental
inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   With Crick's endorsement, the study of subjective states could no
longer be dismissed. Crick's argument also concentrated researchers'
attention on what could be learned instead of what was beyond the
reach of scientific skill. His move to Salk in 1976 had given him a
way to do more than exhort scientists in print: He was now in a
position to bring like-minded researchers together.</TE>
<TE>   "Francis' style was that when he saw an interesting piece of work,
he'd invite the author to visit," says Koch, who met Crick in 1981,
thanks to their common interest in studying neural dendrites. Koch
says that when he was preparing his first paper on consciousness, he
had not received tenure. Crick's agreement to join as a collaborator
ensured that the research wouldn't jeopardize Koch's academic career.</TE>
<TE>   Another person drawn into Crick's circle was Patricia Smith
Churchland, a Canadian-born philosopher who had approached the
consciousness wall from the opposite side. "In 1983, I wrote that we
had a lot to learn from neuroscience," recalls Churchland, who later
joined the faculty of UC San Diego with her husband, philosopher Paul
Churchland. "To philosophers, that was shocking and disgusting. They
thought consciousness was either an insolvable problem or strictly an
armchair affair, and you would never look at the brain."</TE>
<TE>   Although Churchland believed experimentation on consciousness was
still years off, Crick convinced her otherwise. "Francis had thought
a lot about the development of molecular biology and science and what
you need to frame an attack on a problem. I found myself almost
immediately in the mind-set of looking for experiments that would
move us along."</TE>
<TE>   Koch, however, became Crick's chief collaborator. The
Missouri-born son of German parents, Koch had been educated in
Holland, Germany and Morocco as a physicist before landing at
Caltech's computation and neural systems program. On the surface, the
two men could not be more different: Crick projects a scatter-shot
energy; Koch exudes concentration and focus. A dedicated rock climber
and devotee of Apple computers (he sports a tattoo of the company's
multicolored logo on his right arm), Koch is apt to sustain a
conversation while performing casual calisthenics in his Pasadena
backyard, a climbing rope coiled over his shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Every month or so Koch spends a few days at the Crick home,
working on his forthcoming book, "The Quest for Consciousness," and
engaging in dialogue. As the two men toss ideas back and forth, it
seems Koch's role is to keep Crick apprised of interesting fresh
research ("Christof does all the hard work," Crick says generously)
while Crick provides the intellectual goading that helps drive the
field ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "When Francis takes a problem and chews on it and tries this and
that, it's a wonderfully creative process," says Churchland.
"Christof has some of the same character traits. He's relentless on a
problem. Both of them are good at thinking up ideas and quite happy
if an idea turns out to be flawed."</TE>
<TE>   If scientists thought that trying to define consciousness was
elusive, so, too, have been efforts to identify the physical
manifestations they are trying to find. Does conscious thought reside
in a discrete area of the brain, resembling the "Broca's area" that
is devoted to producing speech? Is consciousness produced by a
pattern of electrical impulses, or by a type of neuron that may be
found throughout the brain?</TE>
<TE>   Philosopher John Searle says the difficulty arises partly from the
undifferentiated structure of the brain: "If you were designing an
organic machine to pump blood, you might come up with something like
a heart. But if you were designing a machine to produce
consciousness, who would think of a hundred billion neurons?"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, over the years researchers have tried a number of
hypotheses. At one point, Crick and Koch speculated that the neural
correlate of consciousness might be related to the synchronous firing
of groups of neurons at about 40 hertz (40 times a second). To anyone
convinced that consciousness involves the high-level coordination of
neurons, this was intriguing. But Crick and Koch have more recently
backed off some of their broader claims for that theory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, they are inclined to believe that the neural correlate is a
discrete process in the brain, whether of neurons acting individually
or in groups. "Francis and I believe [it] is probably something very
specific," Koch says. "The biological model is very specific--so many
things in biology are little machines."</TE>
<TE>   One thing is clear: Crick's interest in consciousness came at a
fortuitous moment. Neurologists were just becoming familiar with new
tools, including functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron
emission tomography, that allow researchers to see which parts of the
brain respond to specific stimuli. Implantable electrodes are now
sensitive enough to read the electrical activity of individual
neurons.</TE>
<TE>   Some neurobiologists believe that some parts of the brain are
implicated in consciousness and others are irrelevant. In some cases,
fully half of a patient's brain can be surgically removed without
rendering the patient unconscious. Conversely, damage to certain tiny
structures can place a patient in a lasting coma.</TE>
<TE>   Neuroscientists have identified parts of the brain where
specialized processing that may be integral to "awareness" occurs.
The cortical region devoted to recognizing faces, for example, is
different from the region that responds to images of houses or food.
Specialized neural patterns, similarly, appear to come into play when
an individual tries to imitate another's action.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most optimistic researchers acknowledge that the science
is in its infancy. Among the obstacles is the impossibility of
performing invasive experiments on healthy human brains. Instead,
researchers look for patients suffering certain kinds of brain damage
and compare their responses to various stimuli with those of healthy
subjects. Finding the right patients is hard. One researcher recently
reported that it took five years to assemble 20 subjects with damage
of a certain kind. A favored alternative is experimenting on macaque
monkeys, whose sensory systems resemble humans'--but they can't
report on what they feel.</TE>
<TE>   Some think that going after big game like consciousness remains
premature. "To do an experiment that goes for the moon wasn't right
for our research," says Itzhak Fried, a UCLA neurosurgery professor
who has collaborated with Crick and Koch and treats epileptics by
implanting electrodes in their brains to stimulate seizure-prone
neurons. Fried's precision electrodes allow him to record the
activity of individual neurons as his patients view images of faces,
food and other items.</TE>
<TE>   When Crick first visited Fried's lab, Fried recalls, "I
instinctively thought of consciousness as a quality that seemed too
far from our grasp." But he eventually agreed that the opportunity to
view the workings of the mind neuron by neuron justified spending
time on the big questions. "You can't just look at trivial issues."</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that even identifying the neural correlate of
consciousness will not solve the so-called "hard
problem"--determining how electrical impulses cause emotions,
memories, vision and all of the other phenomena of subjective
perception.</TE>
<TE>   Crick is not convinced that the solution is as far off as many
colleagues believe. "Once you have what the correlate is, you won't
have any difficulty figuring out the cause," he says with a sly
smile. "Some philosophers may think it's hopeless. But we think
they're just not clever enough."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean he has a glimmer of where the research may lead.
It's enough that he has helped start the effort. "Frankly," he says,
with the anticipation of a traveler bound for an uncharted realm, "I
don't know what the answer is."</TE>

<BD>Janet Reitman's last story for the magazine was a
profile of David Rosenthal, a television writer who left Hollywood,
at least temporarily, and moved to New York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The boys who might save your life one day really love fast cars. one
of them, a 24-year-old named Mark Davis, drives a turbo-powered black
Ford Mustang. Earlier this year, Mark took me for a drive through
Tulsa, Okla., where he lives. "Check this out," he said, as we passed
a strip mall. He flipped on a Metallica CD, rolled down the windows,
pumped up the volume as high as it could go, and revved his engine. A
few people standing on the curb staggered back as if they'd been
shot. Mark grinned.</LD>
<LD>   "Dude," he said, supremely satisfied by the effect. "That ruled."</LD>
<LD>   Mark could talk about car stuff for hours, but he has other
consuming passions. A graduate student in computer science at the
University of Tulsa, Mark understands far more about bits and bytes
and other aspects of cyberspace than a good number of adults. So do
many of his friends at the university, most of whom also have
excellent cars, awesome stereos, goatees, piercings and tattoos. The
Dudes, as we might call them, have been playing with computers since
preschool. They have skills they can use in ways most of us cannot
imagine, and that makes them a valuable national asset--assuming they
behave themselves.</LD>
<TE>   In another, flusher time, guys like Mark Davis would be preparing
for lucrative private-sector careers. But these are not flush times,
and it's a foregone conclusion that even the most tech-savvy whiz kid
might have to wait a while for serious money. Luckily, the Dudes have
other plans. Ready or not, Mark and his friends will soon be working
for Uncle Sam. Specifically, they'll be guarding crucial U.S.
infrastructures, thanks to a $30.5-million cyber-security program
known as Cyber Corps.</TE>
<TE>   Started last fall and funded by the National Science Foundation
and the Department of Defense, the program (officially called the
Federal Cyber Service: Scholarship for Service) is for juniors,
seniors and a handful of graduate students. The deal: complete a
degree in cyber security--which involves the study of computer
systems, their flaws and techniques to protect them--courtesy of the
federal government, in exchange for a two-year commitment to work for
the government. Among the many agencies interested in employing them:
NASA, the Navy, the Air Force, the FBI, the CIA, the Office of
Homeland Security and the National Security Agency.</TE>
<TE>   These are unsettling times in America. Osama bin Laden is MIA. War
with Iraq looms. Enemies--invisible, amorphous, ever-threatening--are
out there. They can stage an attack anonymously, from a cyber cafe, a
cell phone or the privacy of a bedroom. Last year, roughly 85% of
American government agencies and corporations reported security
breaches.</TE>
<TE>   Anonymous computer criminals, or "black hats," launching cyber
attacks such as the Nimda worm and the Melissa virus cost the global
economy roughly $10 billion during the first eight months of 2001.
With a few learned keystrokes, say security experts, hackers working
for themselves, corporate espionage operations, organized crime,
hostile governments or terrorist organizations could wreak havoc on
the country's critical electronic infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 16, consultants at a San Diego security firm called
ForensicTec Solutions Inc. illustrated this point, announcing that
they'd used software widely available on the Internet to enter dozens
of confidential military and government computers without permission.
Among the files they perused: an Army "smart book," detailing radio
encryption techniques; hundreds of personnel records containing
Social Security numbers, security clearance levels and credit card
numbers; and, in one case, "a [Defense Department] memo naming
couriers to carry secret documents and their destinations," according
to the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Once an obscure item on the government's agenda, cyber security is
now center stage. Securing the cyber infrastructure is paramount to
homeland security, says White House cyber czar Richard Clarke, and
yet "the government doesn't have anywhere near the number of trained
IT personnel it needs." Clarke won't quantify the size of the
deficit, but other experts do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big black hole," says Alan Paller, director of research at
the SANS Institute, a security consortium based in Bethesda, Md. He
estimates that more than 100,000 federal employees whose jobs involve
computer security have almost no security skills.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Davis, of course, has excellent skills. He could use them for
good or bad. Good seems to be a reasonable choice right now. It pays.
It's "funner." Plus, Mark is a pragmatist. Life, he explains, is kind
of like math. You're born, you live, and at the end you tally up your
experiences hoping that the cool side of the ledger is longer than
the boring side. True, Mark is going to work for "The Man," and he
worries that he might have to lose his eyebrow ring, which would be a
bummer. On the other hand, he's the son of a millwright from Broken
Arrow, Okla., and his education is being paid for by the feds.
Getting paid to hack using some of the most high-tech equipment on
the planet might be worth a few sacrifices and a background check,
particularly if it means he can work for a super-cool agency like the
NSA.</TE>
<TE>   "That agency didn't even admit it existed until a few years ago,"
says Mark. "You've got to figure if you want to get into the really
hairy stuff, that's where it's gonna be."</TE>
<TE>   He says he really has no idea what kind of "hairy stuff" the NSA
might be up to, though he assumes it involves the same type of
high-tech gadgetry as was portrayed in the hacker-friendly movie
"Enemy of the State."</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to be privy to all of the secrets and not be able to
tell anybody," Mark grins. "It's a power trip kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   It's a blustery evening, and Mark and his friend Gavin Manes, 25,
are kicking back at a Tulsa pub called the Slow Duck Saloon. Both are
happily drinking, though Gavin--whose girlfriend has requested that
he come home sober--swears he'll limit himself to one beer. (He has
three.) Mark is on his third Long Island iced tea, a drink he loves
primarily because it has more alcohol than any other drink. Which
isn't to say he's drunk. He's 6-foot-1 and built like a defensive
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to get drunk," he says, smoking a cigarette. Drinking
is pretty much the only vice Mark can admit to right now. "I'm trying
to be good," he says sarcastically.</TE>
<TE>   "So check this out," says Gavin. "This guy called the other day
and said he'd stolen a Porsche in California."</TE>
<TE>   "He stole it?"</TE>
<TE>   Gavin clarifies: "No, no. It wasn't like he stole the car. It was
one of those things where you have to be the 102nd caller to this
radio station and you win a car. So he hacked in and took over the
phone system."</TE>
<TE>   "Dude, that's awesome." Mark grins. He's hacked the phone system,
too, he says, back in the day when he was about 14. When he was 13,
he made a "red box," which is a device that essentially tricks a pay
phone into thinking it's a quarter. (This is not to be mistaken for a
"blue box," which tricks a phone into thinking it's an operator.)
This is kind of a secret--one of many, I suspect.</TE>
<TE>   There seems to be a subtle
don't-ask-too-much/don't-tell-everything ethos built into Cyber
Corps. "A few indiscretions during your 'experimental years' won't
necessarily exclude you from serving your country," says Mike
Orenstein, spokesman at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,
which vets most of the Cyber Corps students.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I gather, there's, like, the past and, like, there's
now," says Mark. "And as long as you don't lie about anything, it's
cool." He, like everyone in the program, signed a contract that will
bind him to a background check and polygraph test if they're required
by the agency hiring him. Until then, he's been instructed to avoid
situations and behaviors that would prevent him from getting security
clearance.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of anything I'm doing illegal now." Mark frowns. He
feels incredibly tame. He even stopped playing with his band, he
says, because band practice cut into his study schedule. His old
friends don't understand the new Mark. "They want to party, and I'm
like, I gotta go home and go to bed." He sighs. "I miss being young
and reckless."</TE>
<TE>   But you're still young, I suggest.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, but I'm not reckless. I miss being reckless." He sighs
again. "You can only be reckless for so long and so far."</TE>
<TE>   "Dude, that's such a lame thing to say," says Gavin, flashing a
rakish grin. A doctoral student in computer science, Gavin is not
part of the scholarship for service component of the program, which
stops at the master's degree level; he's a student mentor, a paid
position that also falls under the Cyber Corps umbrella. This is fine
by Gavin, who admits that his true goal is to prolong graduation as
long as possible. "And, of course, to be totally overpaid in the
private sector," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   Mark regards this remark with a blase shrug. "Dude, I was totally
overpaid in the private sector when I was 19." (He made a living for
a while, he explains, writing software for a consulting firm that
served phone billing companies.)</TE>
<TE>   Gavin smirks. "Yeah, but now you guys have to--I mean, get
to--work for the government."</TE>
<TE>   Mark pretends this doesn't annoy him. "Dude, think about it. We
get a master's degree, government experience, security clearances....
"</TE>
<TE>   "Two years." Gavin makes it sound excruciating.</TE>
<TE>   "But when we get out?" says Mark, smiling knowingly. "Cha-ching!"</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the IT sector couldn't have come at a more
opportune time for the federal government. "Throughout the 1990s, we
couldn't get good IT people," Richard Clarke says. "The government
doesn't have the money to pay high salaries like private companies
did." And now? "This is heady stuff for a 22-year-old," he says. "You
don't make as much money, but you get to do a lot more exciting
things a lot younger."</TE>
<TE>   And who better to fight the invisible foe than the Dudes? They
understand cyberspace intrinsically, says Clarke. "It's like a
language. If you learn it when you're young, you understand it in a
way that those of us who learn it later simply don't."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, hiring the kids with the "scary skills"--let alone
spending tax dollars to train them to police the very networks they
might have dreamed of cracking in the first place--has its risks.
Then again, hacking, Clarke explains, isn't necessarily a bad thing,
provided it's used in the right way.</TE>
<TE>   There are currently 11 Cyber Corps "scholarship for service"
programs in the United States, with a total of 150 students. They are
spread across campuses including Purdue, Tulsa, Iowa State, the
University of Idaho, Carnegie Mellon and the Naval Postgraduate
School in Monterey. With 43 of the 150, Tulsa, a school best known
for training petroleum engineers, is the national leader, thanks in
no small part to the program's director, Sujeet Shenoi, a
cyber-security expert and a member of the Oklahoma Joint Task Force
on Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   Shenoi, a frequent participant in Defense Department-sponsored
symposiums on cyber security and counter-terrorism, is described by
Clarke as a "guiding force" in the field of information assurance and
one of the few U.S. professors qualified to teach cyber security.
Shenoi describes Cyber Corps as a 21st century "Right Stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Gavin and Mark snicker at this kind of rhetoric. "That's just
Shenoi," says Gavin. "He's really enthusiastic." Of course, Gavin
often talks up the program as enthusiastically as Shenoi. It's part
of his job as Shenoi's assistant. But it's mostly talk. The goal, the
guys explain, is to do whatever is necessary but always keep the
ultimate goal--getting free schooling and a two-year job doing
something totally cool--firmly in mind. Mark, for example, recently
cut his waist-length hair to just above the chin when Shenoi
suggested it might make a better impression on the government suits
interviewing him for the program. Another one of their friends has a
tongue ring. "He took it off for his NSA interview," says Gavin.</TE>
<TE>   "See?" says Mark. "You have to understand how to play the politics
game."</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, most of the Dudes aren't like Gavin and Mark. They
have short hair and minimal piercings, and some are members of campus
fraternities. Many have been motivated by a vague, post-9/11 sense of
patriotism--even those who aren't yet eligible for the program. "You
do feel like you owe your country something," says Brock Blackburn, a
beanpole of a sophomore from Colorado who hangs around Gavin's office
and hopes to join Cyber Corps next year. "I mean, Sept. [11] raised
the stakes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's doing something tangible for the country and, like,
meaningful," he says. "I think being a geek these days is pretty much
of a compliment. Like, it's cool if I don't take a bullet for my
country. I can use my head."</TE>
<TE>   Even Gavin sometimes wears that enduring symbol of post-9/11
patriotism, the tiny American flag pin. He's also got a large red,
white and blue poster in his office on the third floor of the
University of Tulsa engineering school: "Cyber Corps: Defending
America's Cyberspace." Perhaps this is more of a political maneuver,
or a sign of gratitude. Thanks to Cyber Corps, the university boasts
one of the few undergraduate computer research labs in the country: a
$4-million facility complete with dual-monitor computers that are
replaced regularly to keep them from becoming obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think of the perks in all of this, the government can't
be that bad," Gavin quips.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that a little cynical?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I am cynical," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then why do this?</TE>
<TE>   "Uh, duh. To have more power. Do you even know what we're doing?"</TE>
<TE>   There is a computer science theorem known as the halting problem
that addresses the nature of cyber security and states, in essence:
Begin with an assumption that we are destined to lose. Shenoi teaches
his cyber-security classes with this theorem in mind. Thus guided,
students go about their days thinking up ways to lose--less. The goal
of Internet security isn't to "win." That, in Shenoi's estimation, is
basically impossible. The goal is to effectively preempt the enemy's
dastardly plans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's interesting because the anti-terrorism laws are changing,
and that gives my students a positive handicap," Shenoi says. It's
also quite troubling, he adds, due to the erosion of privacy laws
that give the government increasing surveillance power. But, this is
war. "We have to assume that whatever position we take, at least half
of the world's population will be [angry] at the United States, so we
have to do the best we can to build defensive postures." It helps, he
explains, to be able to think like a cyber terrorist. He hopes to
train the students to understand how the enemy thinks.</TE>
<TE>   While Cyber Corps' students are not creating viruses, they are
stockpiling viruses and other forms of "computer attacks" for further
study. There are 33,000 computer attacks stored on the main computer
in the university's computer lab. Mark has an additional 3,500
dormant viruses stored on his computer at home. The students are also
doing a bit of "dumpster diving," rummaging through campus dumpsters
looking for trash. This is a valuable technique used by hackers eager
to glean information to which they might not otherwise be privy:
discarded bank statements, interoffice memos, passwords.</TE>
<TE>   The university's dumpster-diving rules are as follows: the
activity must be pre-authorized; take place on school property;
students can't keep what they find; there are penalties if you get
caught breaking rules 1 through 3.</TE>
<TE>   Civilian criminal investigations are also integral to the program.
To learn how to investigate cyber crime, the university has teamed up
with the Tulsa police force's cyber-crime investigations unit. The
curriculum includes hunting down pedophiles and child pornographers.</TE>
<TE>   A civilian setting has useful qualities. Learning how to
investigate cyber crime like a cop means, by default, learning where
the cops might fall short. Theoretically, understanding the weakness
in a system helps strengthen the system. Practically, it could point
a destructive hacker to the major holes in a system. "You don't want
to tell your friends what you're up to," Shenoi says in his computer
security course. "Some of what you learn in this class can put you in
prison for a very long time."</TE>
<TE>   To reinforce this theme, Barbara Geffen, the general counsel for
the University of Tulsa, visited Shenoi's computer forensics class
and spent about 20 minutes explaining Oklahoma telecommunications
law, as well as what might happen if you break it. "You do not want
to replicate software," she said. "It's illegal to replicate
software. It's illegal to steal passwords. Don't do this." She
repeated the word "illegal" several times. Mark, sitting in the
fourth row, suppressed a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   To be clear, the Dudes do not want to go to jail. They just don't
think they will since no one really understands what they're doing
other than, well, them.</TE>
<TE>   The Dudes respect Shenoi--sort of. But they also believe he's
basically clueless. After all, he's 42. "Like, theoretically he knows
a lot, but practically? I could smoke him," says Mark.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, most of the time what we're doing is so far over his head
we have to show him. He's way behind on the research," says Gavin.
Then again, almost everyone is behind on the research. "It's hard
when you get old," says Gavin. "You realize there's a lot you don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Gavin has been feeling extraordinarily old. "Some of these
young guys are so bright, they don't even need a computer--they just
think," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Keller, for example, a sweet-faced, gangly 21-year-old
junior, is not technically in the Cyber Corps--he's thinking of
following in Gavin's footsteps and getting a PhD. But thanks to
Shenoi, who sees mentoring younger students as a particular mission,
Jesse is as integrated into the Cyber Corps as any other student. A
computer whiz, he is so brainy that he was tapped to join a team of
students, including a 50-year-old grad student, in Gaithersburg, Md.,
where they consulted on a project for the FBI. Their assignment was
to inspect a PBX phone system the government was considering
purchasing. The group found many kinks and believes the FBI shelved
its plans and went shopping for a new system.</TE>
<TE>   The beauty of the Internet is that it has enabled even the
nerdiest among us to become superheroes: to wage a hack attack on,
say, the Pentagon (which was done in the late 1990s by an 18-year-old
Israeli hacker who called himself "The Analyzer," and who had the
help of a few California teens), and then pad downstairs in your
sweat socks for dinner with mom and dad.</TE>
<TE>   None of the Dudes have ever been caught doing anything illegal,
including hacking--at least their records are clean. But who are they
really?</TE>
<TE>   Off the record, it's a question dogging every federal agency that
might employ them, say a few officials. On the record, "I can assure
you that we have a very robust screening process," says Michael
Jacobs, former information assurance director of the NSA and an early
booster of Cyber Corps. "It's very successful in assuring we hire not
just competent people, but people dedicated to serving the nation."</TE>
<TE>   That takes care of straight-arrow boys like Jesse and Brock. But
what about Mark? "You can't know for sure that they won't break the
law, but, frankly, if they wanted to do harm to us, they probably
wouldn't choose to work for the federal government anyway," says
Clarke. In other words: Only true patriots are willing to sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that assumption leaves out much of the lesson of Sept.
11. What about the "enemy within"?</TE>
<TE>   Here, neither Jacobs nor Clarke has much of an answer. "Hopefully,
our networks are designed in such a way that they can't be damaged
drastically by one insider," Clarke says. "They're not going to be
making decisions. They'll be supervised."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, most of the Dudes would like to be left alone. It
is part of the hacker code, as stated in "The Hacker Manifesto." You
can find it on the Internet. It defines a hacker as someone who,
among other things, "enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively
overcoming or circumventing limitations." It also defines a hacker as
someone who "detests and avoids" business suits, dishonesty, boredom
and bureaucracies.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't take it literally. It's old-school thinking," says Mark.
"Being a hacker is a mind-set more than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   We are having greasy Chinese food somewhere in the vast strip mall
universe of Tulsa. Mark mentions Kevin Mitnick, a famed "social
engineer" who hacked into online databases and stole thousands of
credit card numbers in the mid-'90s after tricking several network
administrators into giving him their passwords. Mitnick spent a few
years in federal prison. "He did a decent hack. He got caught," Mark
says. "A lot of people do decent hacks, not all of them get caught,
though."</TE>
<TE>   Mark prefers John Draper, a.k.a. Captain Crunch, the creator of
the infamous "blue box." Draper also got caught. Now he is running a
successful cyber-security firm. "Captain Crunch was cool because he
was the first person who figured out how to beat a system," Mark
says, looking at his friends.</TE>
<TE>   So what do they think about cyber war? And who's a "cyber
warrior?" The guys think for a minute. "I guess we are," says Jesse's
friend Tony Meehan, obviously psyched. "See, most of us in this
program are already pretty gray hat, leaning toward white but not
totally."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Tony, who is 20, and Gavin went to the Air Intelligence
Agency at the now-closed Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas,
where they presented a paper on cyber security to a room full of
military brass. Gavin was curious to know how much the generals knew.
"I asked one of these dudes if there was, like, some illegally funded
computer operations in the government--you know, like some shady
Cambodia-Panama kind of thing," he says. The generals didn't take to
that question, he adds. "One guy was like: 'Son, if there is, I'm not
going to tell you.' "</TE>
<TE>   The guys chuckle, but beneath their facade is a distinct sense of
unhappiness. "See, a lot of people simply don't understand security.
There's this dearth of awareness out there," says Gavin. "People who
are not willing to listen to young people do not last long in
security. You know, a lot of the research we're doing is all just
thinking. We don't even really need a computer, since we have this
super-tool." He points to his brain. Tony smiles, contemplatively
chewing on a sparerib.</TE>
<TE>   "The cool thing about Cyber Corps is it's almost like being the
bad guy--except you're a good guy," Tony says. "Of course, you have
to have some moral sensibility," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   So does that mean you've learned how to think like the enemy?</TE>
<TE>   The Dudes laugh. "Oh, that's just a line Shenoi uses to sell the
program," Gavin says. "It's all just curiosity." In other words, no
one's teaching anyone to think like the enemy. Says Gavin: "These
guys already think like the enemy."</TE>

<HD>The Guru of Happy Cows</HD>
<DH>Bill Niman Believes in Giving His Cattle a Special Kind of
Attention. The Result, Say His Customers, Is Beef That's Tastier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>Martin Booe last wrote for the magazine about petits
fours.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"See that? happy cows with an ocean view!"</LD>
<LD>   I am hardly qualified to speculate about the inner life of cows,
but I'll take Bill Niman at his word. We're standing in a jade green
paddock on the original Marin County ranch where Niman began raising
cattle in the early 1970s, and we are pretty much surrounded by cows,
about 300 of them, blinking at us with gentle curiosity. Tufts of
mist curl along the hillsides, and in the distance, shrouded in haze,
lies San Francisco Bay. If nothing else, these cows act as if they
have nothing to fear from humans. Niman says it's because the ranch
hands visit them frequently--on foot, not horseback--and spend a fair
amount of time talking to them.</LD>
<LD>   Niman firmly believes that a happy cow is a tasty cow, and while
this may sound like a New Age flight of fancy, it is solidly rooted
in science. Nervous, stressed cows secrete cortosteriods and other
stress hormones that affect the texture, flavor and color of their
meat. To Niman, the humane treatment of cattle isn't just a matter of
taking the moral high road; it's good business, and that's why he
insists the constellation of 40 ranchers who raise Niman beef, on
spreads largely clustered near Boise, Idaho, adhere to a strict code,
including the stipulation that they walk cattle individually to the
slaughterhouse, to calm them.</LD>
<TE>   If you think that's bunk, you might want to consider that Niman
Ranch has gross sales of $40 million a year--and growing--in beef,
pork and lamb. It's a far cry from the cottage industry Niman started
in the mid-'70s, when he began supplementing his meager teacher's
salary by delivering choice cuts of his own home-grown beef to Bay
Area restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   When Niman started farming in Marin County near Bolinas with eight
pigs and a half-built barn, he had an inkling that animal husbandry
practices were taking a turn for the worse. He did not, however,
foresee the advent of the Frankencow, or the ever-widening market
niche that industrial meat's declining reputation would eventually
make for more naturally raised beef like his.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could say I had a vision for all of this, but I really
didn't," he says. "We really just crawled along an inch at a time. We
never set out to convert anyone. Our attitude was, 'If you agree with
us, come along for the ride.' " As it happened, his timing was
fortuitous. In the late '60s and early '70s, Berkeley was all about
flower power. But by the late '70s, it was all about food. There was
Alice Waters at Chez Panisse, Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San
Francisco and Margaret Fox at Cafe Beaujolais in Mendocino--his first
restaurant account. Admiring Niman's refusal to feed cattle growth
hormones and antibiotics to hasten their fattening, all became
customers. Also strictly barred are animal byproducts, such as
chicken-feather meal.</TE>
<TE>   Niman says today that he didn't appreciate the growing stature of
those first chefs at the time. "I just dealt with them as regular
folk and they dealt with me as regular folk. They were the culinary
giants of the industry. I'm glad I didn't know that at the time. It
would have been intimidating."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that most cows (and pigs and sheep) these days are
anything but happy, and it didn't take Stephen King to conjure the
image of the common beef steer as a hidebound cargo container of
chemicals and byproducts standing on four hoofs. The past year has
seen at least two high-impact salvos that have inspired a lot of
inveterate carnivores to start reaching for the tofu burgers. First
came the bestseller "Fast Food Nation," and next was the recent New
York Times Magazine article by Michael Pollan, documenting in
visceral detail the lurid banquet of hormones, antibiotics and animal
products force-fed to cattle in the beef industry's quest to fatten
them at an unnatural pace. Suddenly, concern about meat quality was
no longer limited to health food nuts, and worries about the
treatment of feedstock gained interest beyond circles of
animal-rights activists.</TE>
<TE>   With his droopy mustache, rangy frame and salt-and-pepper hair,
Niman can, in a certain light, resemble Marin County's answer to
Marshal Dillon--or better yet, the cattle industry's. Donning
horn-rimmed glasses, though, he takes on the aspect of a history
professor. He is soft-spoken, congenial and deferential, but belying
this is an indisputable streak of ambition, one that's aimed more
toward influencing agricultural practices than financial success.</TE>
<TE>   Niman is emerging as one of the country's leading voices in animal
husbandry, and it's a position he relishes. He was the first rancher
to adopt the Animal Welfare Institute's stringent but admirable
standards for raising pigs, which he extends to all 210 pig farmers
who supply Niman Ranch pork. "Without Niman Ranch, our standards
would only be theoretical," says Diane Halverson of the institute.
"Bill brought them to the real world, consumers responded, and others
are following suit."</TE>
<TE>   Among those requirements are that pigs be allowed to nest before
delivering. "It's important for them to have a chance to realize
their instinctive behavior," Niman explains. "We believe you can't
separate an animal's psychological health from its physical health."</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Niman wants to represent the future of animal husbandry.
In practice, by contracting with small farmers who are on a
first-name basis with their cattle, he represents its more humane and
ecologically sound past. "My goal is to turn back the clock on
agricultural practices a good 40 years," he says. "And if we can save
a few hundred family farms in the process, all the better."</TE>
<TE>   Judging by its name recognition among foodies, Niman Ranch is the
prevailing gold standard for beef. In the Bay Area, his home turf,
where culinary passion is rivaled perhaps only by New York, Niman
enjoys something bordering on rock star status. His is one of the few
brands, as with Hudson Valley Foie Gras and Liberty Duck, that is
touted by name on restaurant menus. Once fairly limited to the Bay
Area, his market has expanded considerably. In the past two years,
Niman Ranch products have found increasing favor in Southern
California, as well as the East Coast. In Los Angeles, it's served at
Ammo, Campanile, Jar and Lucques, and at Newport Beach's Aubergine.
Trader Joe's now carries Niman's pork chops and bacon and will soon
distribute his prime rib. Niman Ranch products are also available on
the Internet at www.nimanranch.com.</TE>
<TE>   But what exactly are its selling points? Is it flavor, or is it
the product's reputation for purity? Niman is the first to admit that
the two don't necessarily go hand in hand. "I think when a restaurant
puts 'Niman Ranch' on the menu, they're probably marketing the P.C.
angle," he speculates. "But chefs at the level we're talking about
wouldn't sign on if the flavor weren't there."</TE>
<TE>   The flavor is there, according to any number of chefs. Many
attribute the beef's superior taste to its 21-day dry aging and to
shrouding, an all but forgotten process that causes the meat to shed
much of its water. "I wouldn't say that there isn't any other beef
that can compete with Bill's for flavor," says chef Suzanne Goin of
Lucques. "But when you consider that Bill doesn't take any shortcuts
with his cattle, that his agricultural standards are amazingly pure,
and he still comes out with this superb, highly consistent product,
there's really no one else. And I'd say that 75% of our guests know
Niman Ranch beef by name."</TE>
<TE>   Niman was hardly born to ranching. A native of Minneapolis, he was
a city kid who majored in anthropology at the University of
Minnesota. He spent a year teaching school in a federal poverty
district in the rural San Joaquin Valley, and it was there that he
was exposed to the farming life. "I wasn't actively involved in
agriculture at that time, but I think just being there planted the
seed. I got to know the farmers. Every time I saw an animal born, it
was like a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Berkeley to get a teaching credential, but after a
year decided that "Berkeley was getting a little too heavy," he says
as we slog through the pasture to the wooden house he built in 1977
with his own hands. Small but airy and elegant, it's nestled in a
sylvan grotto of emerald green, shielded from the winds that rake the
coast. "You had the hippies versus rednecks thing, you had racial
turmoil, you had the Symbionese Liberation Army. I needed to get
out."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually he drifted to Marin County, married, worked in
construction to support himself, and wound up with an 11-acre ranch
across the road from where he now lives. On the side, he started
raising hogs under the tutelage of veteran local ranchers. Nearby, a
hippie commune called "Paradise Valley" had sprung up and one Orville
Schell, now dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley
and a noted China scholar, sought refuge on Niman's spread from the
dubious amenities of communal living. Schell, a maniacally
disciplined writer, began working on the book "Modern Meat,"
published in 1984, sitting at the typewriter while balancing his
2-year-old child on his knee. (The book, now out of print but widely
considered a lost classic, decried the looming degradation of animal
husbandry practices.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, the two became partners and acquired the grassy 207-acre
plot of land where Niman still lives. It was more suitable to raising
cattle than hogs. Thus was born Niman Schell Ranch, which became
Niman Ranch seven years ago when Schell sold out his share.
"Basically, I loved the idea of creating food for people," Niman
says. "To me there was something magic about converting forage and
sunlight into flesh and blood. It was a hobby that metamorphosed into
a full-time job."</TE>
<TE>   Schell was the first of several literati who took up residence on
the ranch. Another was the poet and Los Angeles River activist Lewis
MacAdams. "I don't think you could really call Bill a hippie," says
MacAdams, who in 1975 spent a year sleeping in Niman's hog barn and
published a book of poetry, "News From Niman Farm," based on the
experience. "He was way more together than that, and he worked harder
than three people combined. When a hog gave birth at 3 a.m. in the
pouring rain, Bill was out there midwifing. For Bill, it's always
been a labor of love. You could say he was an artistic success long
before he became a commercial success."</TE>
<TE>   Niman has a beef, and it's with purists. He took heat for
contracting with the Chipotle chain, of which McDonald's is a
majority owner, to supply pork for their carnitas. "A few people said
I was getting in bed with the devil. But if you want to change animal
husbandry practices, what better way than to supply a corporation
[owned] by McDonald's? Chipotle had to raise the price of their
burritos by $1.05, and sales doubled. And every time they open a new
store, we save another family farm."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the grass-fed issue. Niman Ranch beef is not strictly
organic because Niman will administer antiobiotics to an animal, but
only if it is diseased. Also, the cattle are "finished" on corn,
which improves marbling. On this note, Niman became engaged in a
spirited e-mail exchange with the New York Times Magazine's Pollan,
who wrote the influential article "Power Steer," tracing the odyssey
of a cow on its way to becoming industrial beef. Pollan held that
feeding grain to beef is unnatural. Niman seriously disagreed, and
the two exchanged many volleys.</TE>
<TE>   Walking through a paddock, Niman toes perennial rye grass that has
gone to seed. Usually laconic, his voice rises at the thought that
critics find it acceptable to feed grass but not corn to cattle,
arguing that their stomachs can't handle corn. "Grass is grain. Corn
is grass. And when grass goes to seed, that's when it's drawing the
most energy out of the soil. The animal's inclination is to nibble
the top of the plant, which is where the most nutrients are. It's a
high-energy diet, and the seed is what prepares their stomachs for
corn. That's why the extended grazing period is so important. It's
like a bear fattening up on the salmon run before hibernation."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, now Alice Waters is nipping at his tail, albeit gently:
"I'd like to see Bill go completely organic," she says. "In fact, I'd
like to see the whole beef industry become purely grass fed and get
rid of the feed lots completely. But I think that right now, given
the scale he's operating on and the way he's maintained the purity of
the product, Bill is in a league of his own."</TE>

<TE>   Braised Beef Shortribs With Young Spinach and Horseradish Cream</TE>
<TE>   from Lucques</TE>
<TE>   Serves 8</TE>
<TE>   For the beef:</TE>
<TE>   8 14- to 16-oz. 2-inch thick beef shortribs marinated overnight in
cracked black pepper and thyme sprigs</TE>
<TE>   1 cup medium diced onion</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup medium diced celery</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup medium diced carrot</TE>
<TE>   3 sprigs Italian flat-leaf parsley</TE>
<TE>   6 sprigs of thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1/2 bottle hearty red wine</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups port</TE>
<TE>   6 cups veal or beef stock</TE>
<TE>   For the potato puree:</TE>
<TE>   4 large russet potatoes</TE>
<TE>   4 large Yukon gold potatoes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons kosher salt for boiling the potatoes</TE>
<TE>   4 teaspoons kosher salt for seasoning the puree</TE>
<TE>   1 cup cream</TE>
<TE>   1 cup milk</TE>
<TE>   1 pound unsalted butter, cut into chunks</TE>
<TE>   For the vegetables:</TE>
<TE>   4 cups young spinach, cleaned</TE>
<TE>   4 shallots, sliced thin</TE>
<TE>   For the horseradish cream:</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup creme fraiche</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon prepared horseradish or more to taste</TE>
<TE>   Mix together, season with salt, pepper and lemon if desired.</TE>
<TE>   For the ribs: Season the shortribs on all sides with salt and
pepper. In a heavy saute pan sear the shortribs in a little cooking
oil until they are caramelized on all sides except the bone side.
Remove the ribs to a platter and saute the vegetables in the same
pan, stirring constantly to pick up all the crusty bits left in the
pan until the vegetables are caramelized. Add the bay leaf, thyme and
parsley. Add the balsamic vinegar, port and red wine and reduce by
three-quarters. Add the veal stock and let come to a boil. Pour the
liquid into a braising pan and then place the shortribs and their
juices in the pan.The liquid should come 3/4 of the way up the side
of the meat. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and then aluminum foil.
Braise in a 350-degree oven for about 3 hours.</TE>
<TE>   After 2 hours and 45 minutes, insert a paring knife into a
shortrib to check for doneness. The meat should fall off the knife
easily. When the meat is done, uncover the pan and let the ribs brown
in the oven for 10-15 minutes until they are caramelized. Let the
ribs rest for 1/2 hour in their juices, then remove them to a sheet
pan and strain the juices. When the juices cool you will be able to
skim off most of the fat. When you are ready to serve, reheat the
ribs in their skimmed juices.</TE>
<TE>   For the potatoes: Boil the potatoes with skin on in water to cover
with 2 tablespoons salt. When the potatoes are cooked through, strain
them and set aside to cool until you can handle them. Peel the
potatoes and put them through a food mill or potato ricer. Put the
riced potatoes in a heavy-bottomed pan. In a separate pot, heat the
milk and cream together. Over medium heat stir the potatoes with a
wooden spoon to dry them out. Then slowly add in the hunks of butter,
stirring constantly. Season with 4 teaspoons kosher salt. When all
the butter has been absorbed, slowly add in the milk/cream mixture
until you achieve the consistancy of a puree. Taste for seasoning and
remove from the stove.</TE>
<TE>   At the restaurant, we pass the mixture through a fine mesh tamis
with a rubber spatula two times.This makes an extremely smooth puree.
You can skip this step if you want a more rustic style potato puree.
If you are going to serve the puree soon, you can keep the potatoes
in a metal bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap. Otherwise you can
make them ahead of time, let them cool, keep them refrigerated and
later heat the puree in the oven with a little more cream.</TE>
<TE>   When you are ready to serve: Put the ribs in their juices in a
400-degree oven to reheat. Saute the spinach and shallots in 1
tablespoon butter until just wilted. Season with salt and pepper. In
the center of 8 large bowls place a spoonful of hot potato puree.
Divide the spinach among the 8 bowls. Place a shortrib in the center
of each bowl and spoon over some of the braising liquid. Top with a
generous spoonful of horseradish cream and serve immediately.</TE>

<DH>David Paul Bayles' Photographs Remind Us That a City's
Trees, Properly Seen, Offer More Than Just Parking-Lot Shade</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Cheverton</AU>
<BD>Richard Cheverton's last story for the magazine was a
profile of Irvine Ranch heiress Joan Irvine Smith. He is writing the
text for a book of Bayles' urban tree photographs, to be published by
Sierra Club Books next fall.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Paul Bayles toils in the workaday world of portrait
photography, making pictures that are more likely to wind up in a
rumpus room than the white cube of a gallery or museum. They are fine
photographs, and Bayles is justifiably proud of his work even as he
acknowledges that family portrait shooters aren't exactly at the top
of the profession's pecking order.</LD>
<LD>   But for two decades Bayles has also been secretly making images of
trees. Specifically, trees in the city--the place of tension, as
Bayles sees it, between "what we build and what we grow." Then he
adds, sorrowfully, "We ask these trees to live in such an unnatural
place."</LD>
<LD>   This seems an odd preoccupation for a photographer of human
families, until Bayles relates one key fact: Fresh out of college, he
spent four summers in the early 1980s working as a lumberjack in the
western Sierra. He didn't actually cut down any of the big
trees--that was work for two-man teams of "fallers" and "buckers." He
was a "choke-setter," in the trade's rich argot, the guy who
clambered around logs that had been trimmed to a uniform 33 feet
length, attaching cables to pull them out of "the sale."</LD>
<TE>   Cutting down big trees is one of the most dangerous jobs on the
planet. Cuts, nicks, scrapes are routine. But Bayles will never
forget the log that almost killed him, careening down a steep
hillside like the giant boulder pursuing Indiana Jones. It was a
"very, very close call--I wrote a very bad poem about it," Bayles
recalls. "If I was going to be taken out, that beautiful piece of
wood would be the way I'd want to go. That was pure sugar pine."</TE>
<TE>   Since then, as Bayles moved into the world of portrait
photography--and became increasingly rooted in the city--trees
continued to hold him in their thrall. He spotted his first "city
tree" image, literally on the run, as he dashed along a Santa Barbara
street trying to get to a photo shop before it closed. He came back
and took a moody portrait of ficus trees posed against a wall of
eerily glowing windows--a picture, he later found, that can only be
made during a single month when lighting conditions are just right.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved the balance and the harmony and the beauty between the
man-made structure and the tree," he says. "It was really a metaphor
for my struggle with having cut down trees but yet loving trees at
the same time. And living in the city, becoming part of the
environmental movement and understanding what that meant, and yet
having lived on this side where I'm supposed to hate these [lumber
industry] guys."</TE>
<TE>   It made for some odd moments, this sense of betwixt-and-between:
"After my first summer in the woods," Bayles recalls, "I went to a
party in L.A. with a friend of mine. His friends had just built a new
redwood deck and they were having a party to inaugurate it.
Inevitably somebody asked me what I did, and I told them I was a
lumberjack. The whole deck quieted down. Everybody looked at me and
then the question came: 'How dare you cut down trees?' I was just
flabbergasted at that."</TE>
<TE>   Gradually, through travels in Europe and across the country--as
well as his deepening involvement with the world around Seal Beach,
where his portrait studio is based in a tidy Main Street
studio--Bayles kept adding to his idiosyncratic collection. "This is
a project that's part of my daily life," he says. "I never set out to
go look for the urban forest."</TE>
<TE>   And yet he found it.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, Bayles' feelings about the tenuous tree-city
relationship have changed: "Looking through all this work--I don't
know what to make of the fact that I started this process looking at
beauty and harmony and balance. And the more I've looked at it, I've
moved from that to more of what I see as the imbalance and the irony
and the human folly."</TE>
<TE>   Bayles' images of trees avoid the trap of propaganda; these are
not cute or angry or tragic surrogates for human politics. Instead,
they seem weirdly like visitors from another world, perhaps another
dimension--and, in a real sense, they are. Trees, no less than
epoch-layered rock canyons, remind us that there are different ways
of computing time; that within the frantic rush of man-made cities
are eddies and rills of slowness, sureness; that there are cycles as
profound as the procession of the stars. Trees reproach our temporary
manias while also serving as an antidote.</TE>
<TE>   As Bayles puts it: "All I really hope of my photographs is that
people just look at trees around them in a different way. I'd be
satisfied with that."</TE>

<LD>German precision and Japanese serenity mingle in industrial designer
Holger Schubert's Venice home overlooking the canals. A tall ficus
hedge conceals the white-and-gray stucco structure from the public
footpath, but the interior is flooded with light and full of
surprises. It's a machine for living that works in interesting ways
and an experiment in minimalism that is enriched by views of water,
sky and greenery.</LD>
<LD>   Schubert, who trained as an industrial designer at Art Center in
Pasadena, was planning to build on a beachfront plot when he chanced
on the tranquil enclave of the canals--all that remain from Abbot
Kinney's ambitious project of the early 1900s to re-create Venice
beside the Pacific. He and his wife, Yuriko Nagasaki, wanted to raise
a family and decided that it would be quicker to remodel an existing
house than start from scratch. Schubert, who owns the Culver City
design practice Archisis, bought a 10-year-old contemporary
residence, intending only to upgrade the kitchen and master bathroom.
One thing led to another, and it took more than three years and
$500,000 to refine the entire house.</LD>
<TE>   "I decided to tear out all the stuff we didn't like, saving
whatever we could, and then design new window openings, built-ins and
finishes," he says. "I was naive, thinking it was just a matter of
drywall, glass and paint." Pivoting doors, limestone paving and white
oak paneling demanded expert installation into the existing
structure. Holger learned the hard way that few share his sense of
perfectionism, and that you don't demolish anything before deciding
what to put in its place. "You have to know where you are going or
it's costly, time-consuming and messy," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the house is finished, harmony rules. In contrast to
neighboring residences, where the ground floor is for living and
upstairs for sleeping, the master bedroom opens onto the enclosed
garden, and the bathroom is suffused with natural light from a
sliding glass door that is screened by feathery bamboo. Both were
inspired by Holger's three-year professional sojourn in Tokyo. He
learned to live with a minimum of possessions in one room and to
appreciate the alternation of light and shade, the sensuous and the
austere.</TE>
<TE>   In his three-story home, Japanese minimalism continues to
influence his aesthetic. A deep soaking tub occupies much of the
bathroom, and the open shower can be screened off by a pair of
curtains. The floor slopes to a concealed strip drain and a mirror
slides across on an overhead track. Essential tools, such as electric
toothbrushes and a Water Pic, are clamped to built-in storage
cabinets above a pair of walnut-encased pedestal sinks. The bedroom
ceiling was lowered to achieve intimacy and conceal a structural
beam, and a flat television screen pivots on a central column so that
it can be viewed from the bed or the sofa.</TE>
<TE>   Aluminum-clad steps with a stainless steel handrail lead up to the
second-floor living areas and office and to the upper-level guest
bedroom and roof terrace. The kitchen and dining area flow out of the
double-height living room, and sunlight from 11 south-facing windows
plays over the white walls and concrete floors. Expansive sliding
windows to the west frame the canal. Holger designed the dining table
using a medium-density fiberboard with a matte white finish supported
on two aluminum-wrapped poles set in concrete. An opening at the
center accommodates a metal container for making the Japanese dish
shabu-shabu, or a glass dish can be substituted. When illuminated
from recessed spots directly above and below, it casts shadows on the
floor and ceiling. Sheer white organza drapes surround the
20-foot-high office on three sides, turning it into what the designer
calls "a floating work tent," and a circular pedestal table revolves
to keep the computer screen out of the sun.</TE>
<TE>   As a first house by a designer with no architectural training, the
project has turned out well. Holger has given functionalism a human
face, and he and Yuriko are constantly surprised by the way the house
changes its character throughout the day. They wish they had more
storage space, but realize they'd quickly fill whatever they had. The
arrival of Kaya, the couple's 1-year-old daughter, has changed some
of the design elements. "I love the sun, but for her it was too
bright, so I had to install drapes," Holger says. However, he is
busily planning a beach house, incorporating the lessons he has
learned from this home.</TE>

<DH>At Pal's, Veterans Had a Place Where Everybody Knew Their
Names</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL T. JARVIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pal's bar in West L.A. was the closest place to home for many a
veteran who passed the time in the now-vanished storefront tavern's
red leatherette seats. The regulars spanned World War I to Vietnam,
and they convened on endless afternoons to share cigarettes, drinks
and war stories beneath the bar's glowing neon signs and ceiling fan.
An office building displaced the decades-old bar in the early 1980s,
but Pal's Hopperesque wistfulness endures in a series of hand-colored
photos by Venice artist George Small, now at TAG, The Artists'
Gallery, in Santa Monica.</LD>
<LD>   Small vividly remembers his first visit in 1977 to Pal's on
Sawtelle Boulevard, a block from the Veterans Administration Medical
Center. "Vietnam was still fresh in everyone's mind," he says. "There
was a community at Pal's. They had a place to go where they were safe
and cared for and friendship was really valued. Ethnicity knew no
bounds. They took care of each other. When you have that in common,
it's everything."</LD>
<LD>   Owner Owen Klein, whose father purchased the bar during the late
1940s, served as in-house patron saint for the veterans, Small says.
"Owen got them jobs, cashed their checks and served meals, including
Christmas and Thanksgiving dinner. He made sure the vets didn't get
into trouble. He'd have them write stories and do contests. He had
heart."</LD>
<TE>   Small and his camera spent about a month behind the bar for the
project, originally a collaboration with writer R. David Stephens
(who taped hours of conversation with the vets) for a magazine
article that was never published. For many shots Small literally
aimed "from the hip" at waist level without a flash, lighting his
tableaux with the afternoon sunlight that filtered through the bar's
Venetian blinds. Not all of the regulars were vets, he notes. A woman
in her 70s known as "Mama" came in daily to savor a pitcher of beer
and reread the same packet of letters.</TE>
<TE>   Small, 56, was born in Phoenix and raised in Los Angeles. He
studied art and graduated from Cal State Northridge. A high draft
number kept him out of Vietnam, and he practiced bronze casting in
Mexico and taught at the Art Studio in Santa Monica, which he owns,
while working as a sculptor. Last year Small displayed photos of
re-created 1930s and '40s scenes at TAG.</TE>
<TE>   For the Pal's show, he located his hundreds of negatives and
enlarged selected black-and-white shots to "life-size" 34-by-44-inch
prints before hand-coloring them with chalk, pencil and watercolors.
"I wanted to give it that richness," Small says. "The back room is
cool. But in front it's hot and smoky--like stills from a movie, each
scene colored and lit. Life is rarely one-dimensional." Indeed it
isn't. In one shot, a WWII veteran in a fedora, coat and tie clasps
the hand of a tattooed Vietnam vet with hair past the collar of his
denim jacket. "When you have that in common, it's everything," Small
says.</TE>

2903 Santa Monica Blvd., (310) 829-9556.</TE>

<LD>INVITED TO: Carousel of Hope, Marvin and Barbara Davis' biennial
charity ball to benefit childhood diabetes research at the Beverly
Hilton.</LD>
<LD>   GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE HOT: "Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen,
it's for a good cause, so bid your brains out," urges barker Tony
Danza, a Carousel fixture, cooing into a cordless mike in the Jewelry
and Luxury Items section. The hotel's ground floor has been
transformed into a veritable silent auction souk. Well, not that
silent: Fellow barkers Tom Arnold and Ed McMahon find each other at
the Sporting Goods section by announcing their coordinates over the
P.A. system. Penny Marshall hunkers around the rock memorabilia. "I
got a dog with diabetes," she remarks. "I'm not making fun. It's
true." But before you know it, it's time to move on to the dining
hall, much to the chagrin of Owen Wilson, who took a shine to an Ed
Ruscha painting. "I thought it was great," he says. "I just got here
and they closed the bidding. Story of my life."</LD>
<TE>   THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE FREE: "This year is the silver
anniversary of the C.O.H.--we will celebrate 25 years of outstanding
progress," announces oil baroness Barbara Davis, whose biennial
benefit attended by the likes of Martin Sheen, Samuel L. Jackson,
Lisa Kudrow, Oprah Winfrey and the Lizzes--Taylor and Hurley--will
this year raise $5 mil for the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood
Diabetes in Denver. Halle Berry gives a salute to Sidney Poitier, and
B.B. King, Sting and Elton John all perform. When Lakers owner Jerry
Buss collapses at his table, rumors fly like peas in a junior-high
cafeteria ("He stopped breathing!" "White as a ghost!"). But it's
just a pinched nerve in his neck, and relieved emcee Jay Leno moves
on to the Carousel's traditional celebrity raffle of wacky gifts.
Raquel Welch wins an Easy Sew. Dr. Phil, the Epil Stop hair remover
("apparently he already uses one," Leno quips). Kate Hudson takes
home a case of Oxi Clean, and Ray Romano, a much-appreciated Contour
back pillow ("I got a bad everything," the "Everybody Loves Raymond"
lead says.) Thus encumbered, the rich and famous nonetheless wouldn't
dream of bypassing the goodie- bag room, where massive swag bags are
being bungee-cabled onto portable luggage dollies. Kelsey Grammer and
Christian Slater actually lock wheels on the way to the valet. "It's
humiliating. I don't think anybody should give a goodie bag you have
to wheel out," says Shannen Doherty. Why bother queuing up, then?
"Well," the erstwhile "Charmed" star admits, "I'm curious to see
what's in it."</TE>

<LD>Can a dead gerbil be resurrected? Can subliminal suggestion make
people spontaneously expose their underpants? These are just a few of
the investigations being undertaken by the sketch comedy troupe The
Ministry of Unknown Science.</LD>
<LD>   Founders Jason Berlin, Rico Gagliano, Eric Trueheart and Timothy
P. Walker cooked up MOUS at Burning Man 2000 when they decided to
apply their backgrounds in comedy writing, design and performance art
to the rigorous pursuit of hilarity. Abetted by dozens of
behind-the-scenes volunteers, Ministry shows combine live performance
with interactive digital video clips to prove a comedic hypothesis.
The four lab-coated mad scientists performed their first experiment
in April of 2001 and have been gaining momentum like a quark in a
particle accelerator in periodic sold-out performances around Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The "scientific comedic think tank's" bold inquisitions have
tackled subjects as base as underwear and as metaphysical as one
man's personal relationship with Jesus--who happens to be his
roommate. Mind control is a favorite methodology. For the underpants
project, the Ministers hypothesized that subliminal messages could
induce audience members to display their underwear. Using "top
secret" mind-melding techniques, they whipped the crowd into a mass
display of tighty-whities and boxers, crowning the proceedings with
an appearance by the "god of underpants," a 20-foot-tall pair of
skivvies.</TE>
<TE>   Truehart, Gagliano and Berlin work as film and TV writers while
Walker, a former manager of creative affairs and an art director at
Hearst Entertainment, acts as the troupe's producer. "Our goal is to
give science to the largest number of people possible," Berlin says.
On Nov. 30, the Ministry will appear at the 29th annual Loscon, the
Los Angeles Science Fiction and Fantasy/Literary Convention at the
Burbank Hilton. For the 9 p.m. show, dubbed "The Bakula Episode," the
Ministers will attempt to induce audience members to see
hallucinogenic images of whomever they truly love most.</TE>
<TE>   But even as they seek cathode-ray supremacy, the Ministers hope to
launch vectors of laughter in more intimate venues. "We're looking
for a bris," Gagliano says. "But they're kind of hard to book."</TE>

<DH>You May Never See the People Who Bring the Season's Bounty
From a California Desert, or How Many Die Trying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Straight</AU>
<BD>Susan Straight's last piece for the magazine was about
raising kids without risk. Her novel "Highwire Moon" was recently
released in paperback by Anchor Books.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I went to the desert recently, to the bottom of California, to a
world most Americans never see, though they eat the grapes, lemons,
grapefruit, fish and dates grown in Riverside and Imperial counties.
I have been coming here all my life, to camp as a child in the
Anza-Borrego, to visit family, or just to see all the food that comes
from this naturally barren landscape. I drove south toward Indio, the
same route I follow every year, leaving Riverside behind and entering
the desert. I always linger in the date groves of Indio and Thermal,
then the vineyards of Mecca, skirting the Salton Sea, and finally
head for Calexico, the last place in California. I come to remember
where this bounty is grown and touched, and always, every year, I
marvel at our ability to defer the truth, which is all around me,
around us.</LD>
<LD>   We face each other here, Mexico and California, in the expanse of
sand and cactus and mountains that migrants cross to enter the
richest nation on earth. According to the U.S. Border Patrol, more
than 519 illegal immigrants died in the San Diego and El Centro
sectors between October 1997 and September 2002. They died of
dehydration or they froze, they drowned or died in vehicle accidents.
Operation Gatekeeper, begun in 1994 to seal off the area around
Tijuana and San Ysidro, has forced migrants toward this desert.</LD>
<TE>   Often abandoned by their smugglers in the canyons and arroyos of
remote mountains, or in the vast expanse of land around the Salton
Sea, they wander the hot sand, shelter under mesquite trees and drink
their own urine in desperation. Between October 1998 and September of
this year, 1,447 migrants were rescued in those two sectors, most by
Border Patrol agents and some by Americans and Mexican Americans
searching for lost souls on their own. Those rescued are sent back
across the border, of course. But they always try to cross again. In
fall heat reaching more than 100 degrees, they head here to harvest
the ripening lemons, grapefruit and dates. They sometimes find the
water tanks concerned Americans have placed in strategic locations to
save them. Or they sometimes find the tanks empty, since other
Americans, angry at the migrants, may have vandalized the tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Some don't die of thirst--they drown in the All-American Canal, a
wide blue-gray rush in cement banks on which it is impossible to gain
a handhold. The canal, which parallels the Mexican border from
Calexico into Arizona, brings water to the crops the migrants are
trying to pick, to load onto pallets and trucks, then to unload at
warehouses, or maybe to cook in restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   In the desert, almost every face along the highway was brown:
vanloads of pickers, truckers moving tomatoes and grapes and citrus,
and men driving dusty old American cars. The date palm groves outside
Indio were as serene as cathedrals, the dangling golden fruit
protected by paper bags attached by men in cherry-pickers. Along the
grapevines near Mecca, where the harvest was on, hundreds of
bandannaed faces and baseball caps moved up and down the rows. At
Niland, tilapia grew in ponds tended by workers feeding the fish and
cleaning the water.</TE>
<TE>   I passed the brackish expanse of the Salton Sea, where my former
husband's relatives used to fish for corvina. His people, refugees
themselves from the economic deprivation of Mississippi, settled in
Calexico in 1950 because that's where their car broke down, as family
legend goes. They laughed at the primary crop there back then:
cotton. Some of their descendants were among the first black U.S.
Border Patrol agents.</TE>
<TE>   Near the border, I stared out at the shimmering sand and ghostly
smoke trees. Before 1994, hundreds of people scaled fences and walls
nightly in Tijuana and San Ysidro, all around San Diego and in other
cities along the border. Now, hundreds move through the mirages
hovering above the asphalt and creosote. I looked at the canal and
thought, "Water is inexorable, and will find another way."</TE>
<TE>   Americans don't see the migrants. I have heard people react to
migrant deaths, or numbers of migrant crossings, or reports of
Mexicans returning home to vote, by saying, "Where do these people
hide? I never see them." They haven't seen the hills outside
Riverside, where my mother will move into a new development, where
Mexican men pour the concrete, nail the drywall, and crawl on the
roofs to lay tile. My children, with their brown skin and long black
hair, always notice Mexican immigrants. They are often mistaken for
Mexican children, admired in Spanish by female hotel workers when we
stay overnight, smiled at tenderly by restaurant workers when we are
standing in a parking lot where cooks and buspeople are taking a
break.</TE>
<TE>   I can speak Spanish, not well but politely, and they tell me they
are from Zacatecas and Michoacan and Nayarit. They tell me about
their kids, or where their families live now. We talk about the
weather. Then they go back inside.</TE>
<TE>   At restaurant chains, where the waitresses are generally American
women, my children have noticed that the cooks are generally Mexican
men. My girls have commented on this in Santa Barbara and L.A., in
New York City, in Flagstaff and Riverside. The border seems a porous
place to them, and they wonder how people can die in the sand trying
to get to the street near their grandfather's house, where
day-laborers have gathered for years, dozens of men glancing toward
our car, checking our faces to see if we want them.</TE>
<TE>   I left the All-American Canal and headed north toward Mecca in the
early evening. People were preparing to sleep in cars, in truck beds,
in motels where they crowd 10 to a room, or just on a blanket under a
tree in a vacant lot. I saw men firing up tiny grills, opening beers,
gathered in a circle around dinner like the cowboys of the old
movies. Except their horses were old Impalas and Broncos, and they
were in the desert, in vacant lots outside Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered when the men got paid in the vineyards, in the date
groves, on the citrus farms. My brother, who lived in an orange grove
at the edge of Riverside, told me he'd witnessed Mexican crews finish
picking oranges or grapefruit, the foreman calling immigration on the
last day. My brother watched, gathering his own grapefruit, while the
men scattered through his trees or were picked up by light-green INS
vehicles. No money traded hands.</TE>
<TE>   At the edge of Indio, I stopped to eat at a fast-food place where
everyone behind the counter spoke Spanish, as did everyone ordering.
I ate my French fries and thought about who had touched them, when
they were potatoes in the dirt, when they were being sliced and
frozen, when they were unpacked and fried just now.</TE>
<TE>   It was late and still hot in the desert, and I had to go home. I
headed north again, passing the darkened date groves, the palm fronds
like feather dusters against the purple sky.I passed one vineyard
where headlights were aimed toward the grapes, so people could keep
picking in the cool of night. My radio was tuned to Radio Tricolor,
which plays its call numbers and a signature tune proclaiming
"Mexicanisima." I heard songs about migrants who died, who lived, who
sent money home but were forgotten by their wives, or who forgot
their wives. Songs about migrants from Zacatecas and Sinaloa, about
la migra and love. Bad love, good love, and lots of songs about
loving a ranchito in Mexico, about missing home. Between the songs
were commercials for Sears. "Es su tienda." It's your store.</TE>
<TE>   I watched the vineyard recede in the rearview mirror, the silvery
headlights pooling much brighter than the distant moon.</TE>

<HD>Asian trip means more planning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur Frommer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I shall be leaving shortly on a trip to China, and a pile of
guidebooks, brochures and e-mails from friends stands 2 feet high on
my bedside table. For Americans, travel to Asia takes more than the
usual preparations, and even with all my previous trips to the Far
East, I'm still nervous about overlooking some important advance
task.</LD>
<LD>   Apart from reading about political, economic and cultural
conditions and making reservations, I've needed to arrange shots for
hepatitis A and B, order a cell phone that can make outgoing calls
from Asia and select a giant historical novel for the long flight.</LD>
<LD>   Other general preparation for Asia falls into four categories:</LD>
<TE>   Deciding when to go: The seasons in Asia are different from those
in the United States and Europe. Asian countries fall into three
general climatic zones. In the north -- Japan and Korea -- you are in
a temperate zone with conditions akin to those of the U.S. and most
of Europe. Tokyo's weather is similar to that of Washington, D.C.;
Korea's is closer to that of Fargo, N.D., and it can get cold there
in winter.</TE>
<TE>   The second great zone -- from Hong Kong and Taiwan south through
Southeast Asia and over to India -- is tropical and subtropical, and
you will generally encounter year-round heat in all places other than
New Delhi and northern India. Hong Kong and Taiwan are slightly
cooler December through February, but not markedly so.</TE>
<TE>   China is a zone all its own. Beijing has cold and windy winter
weather, hot and dry summers and passable spring and fall weather.
Shanghai is a bit more like Hong Kong and Taiwan. China's worst
weather occurs during the cold months of December through February in
Beijing, and the rainy season of July and August in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing relative costs: Japan is the costliest Asian
destination, followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Bangkok
(the latter two about the same). Indonesia and northern Thailand
(Chiang Mai) are at the bottom of the list. Above them are New Delhi
and Manila. In the middle: Beijing; Shanghai; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;
and Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding local religions: You should read about the religions
of the countries you plan to visit. Keep in mind that Mahayana
Buddhism (which allows priests to marry and have families) is the
predominant religion of Asia, particularly strong in Thailand and
Japan. In Japan, most Japanese are both Buddhists and Shintoists.</TE>
<TE>   Koreans are equally divided between Buddhism and Christianity (the
latter Catholic and Protestant in about equal parts). In countries or
areas where the Chinese predominate (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore),
there are few practicing Buddhists, and most Chinese follow the
teachings of Confucius. In the Philippines, most of the population is
Catholic, with a scattering of Protestants and Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   India is three-quarters Hindu and one-quarter Muslim, with a
scattering of Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Bahais. Bali practices
a form of Hinduism; the rest of Indonesia and Malaysia is generally
Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for local customs: Far more than for a trip to Europe or
elsewhere, you should also read up about particular Asian customs,
such as the usual practice of not touching another person -- except,
on rare occasions, when they will deign to shake hands out of
deference to your strange Western ways.</TE>
<TE>   In Thailand, because of Buddhist teachings, the head in particular
should not be touched, even to pat the head of a child, and you
should be careful where you point the bottoms of your feet. Never
expose the soles of your feet or shoes to anyone, especially a statue
of the Buddha or a picture of the king. It is polite to take off your
shoes when entering homes and temples in Buddhist countries. Note
that in most homes, there are also separate slippers for the toilet,
found right outside of it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the unrest in the world, many people are looking for
vacations close to home. Southern Californians are fortunate to have
seven cruises departing every week from Los Angeles and San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   First-timers may want to test the waters with a three-day cruise,
sailing from Los Angeles on Friday with a day at sea and a visit to
Ensenada, Mexico, or a four-day cruise leaving Monday with a day at
sea and calls at Ensenada and Catalina.</LD>
<LD>   Cruisers with more time and money can choose seven-day sailings
from Los Angeles or seven- and 10-day cruises from San Diego. All
seven-day Riviera cruises call at the same ports: Puerto Vallarta,
the quintessential Mexican resort, with red-tile roofs and
cobblestone streets running along the wide beach; Mazatlan, with its
shopping areas and the Papantla Flyers, who have been performing
their aerial act for decades; and Cabo San Lucas, where the town is
an easy stroll from the tender dock.</LD>
<TE>   Seven-day cruises from San Diego into the Gulf of California offer
a different view of Mexico, concentrating on the small towns of Baja
California. Calls are made at Pichilingue for La Paz, where you can
snorkel with sea lions at Isla los Islotes; Loreto, which has a
mission founded in 1697; and Santa Rosalia, which displays its French
colonial influence in a church designed by Gustave Eiffel.</TE>
<TE>   On 10-day cruises from San Diego, two more stops are added to the
usual Riviera ports: Acapulco and Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa.</TE>
<TE>   Because the itineraries are much the same, choosing which ship to
sail on depends on your lifestyle and what you expect from your
cruise.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival Cruises ([800] CARNIVAL [227-6482], www.carni val.com)
has year-round sailing on the 70,367-ton Ecstasy, which carries 2,052
passengers on three- and four-day cruises leaving Los Angeles every
Monday and Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The shipboard atmosphere is active, and the vessel is filled with
young and old, looking to have as much fun as they can. The ship is
bright and gaudy, and music is everywhere. Rates on a three-day
cruise range from $699 to $1,149; on a four-day, from $849 to $1,379.</TE>
<TE>   The Elation, a sister ship of the Ecstasy, makes seven-day
round-trip sailings every Sunday from Los Angeles. The atmosphere is
much the same as the Ecstasy's, but you could spend a quiet moment in
Duke's, an intimate piano bar with a New York setting. Rates range
from $1,349 to $2,599.</TE>
<TE>   The 78,491-ton Vision of the Seas, from Royal Caribbean
International ([800] 327-6700, www.royalcaribbean.com), sails every
Sunday from Los Angeles on seven-day round trips through April. The
2,435-passenger Vision is aptly named: Windows provide vistas nearly
everywhere. The ship's atmosphere is active, with entertainment,
sports, fitness and a large spa. Rates run from $1,279 to $6,449.</TE>
<TE>   The 109,000-ton Star Princess, from Princess Cruises ([800]
PRINCESS [774-6237], www.princess.com), carries 2,600 passengers and
makes regular seven-day round-trip cruises from Los Angeles on
Sundays through April. This elegant ship is dressier and offers
dazzling entertainment, plenty of deck space and pools and a
late-night disco 15 decks above the sea. Rates range from $1,379 to
$4,519.</TE>
<TE>   The 77,000-ton Sun Princess, with 1,950 passengers, has several
10-day sailings from Los Angeles this winter and spring. It has a
more intimate atmosphere, with the same amenities offered on larger
ships. A favorite alternate dining spot is Fabio's, which features
made-to-order pizzas. Rates range from $1,639 to $4,179.</TE>
<TE>   Holland America's 55,451-ton Ryndam and Statendam, carrying 1,266
passengers each, sail round trip from San Diego on seven-day Gulf of
California cruises, calling at Loreto, La Paz and Cabo San Lucas.
Seven-day cruises call at Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San
Lucas. Holland America ([800] 426-0327, www.hollandamerica.com) also
has 10-day cruises calling at Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, Acapulco,
Zihuatanejo and Puerto Vallarta. These beautifully appointed ships
have a more relaxed and restful atmosphere, offering fine dining and
entertainment and an excellent library. Rates for seven days at sea
range from $1,762 to $7,322, 10-day cruises from $2,669 to $10,629.</TE>
<TE>   All rates quoted above are per person, double occupancy. Almost
any travel agent should be able to get lower prices in today's
market.</TE>

<HD>Like home, but better, in Hermosa</HD>
<DH>Surf, sand and entertainment are just steps away from an
upscale hotel in the down- to-earth South Bay town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Craig Nakano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Hermosa Beach</DL>
<LD>Ah. Home, sweet home.</LD>
<LD>   I grabbed a drink from the fridge, put my feet up on the coffee
table and kicked back to Coldplay and Peter Gabriel alternating on
the CD changer. Had I stepped outside onto my deck, I would have
heard the Pacific playing its own song, waves landing on sand like
soft strikes on a cymbal.</LD>
<LD>   But I was content on the couch. I could contemplate my four phones
(all obligingly silent), my two TVs (both off) and my fireplace
(calmly flickering). In the morning my kitchen staff would have
breakfast waiting. My maid would tidy the room. My driver would bring
the car.</LD>
<TE>   Yup, it was a good life. Until it was time to leave. For my real
home.</TE>
<TE>   Unless I win the lottery or polar icecaps suddenly melt and
submerge West L.A., my home is nowhere near the ocean. So two weeks
ago, I did the next best thing to buying a house at the beach: I
bought two nights at the Beach House.</TE>
<TE>   The upscale Beach House hotel sits on a decidedly downscale
stretch of Los Angeles County coast. "Downscale" is a relative term,
of course, used only in comparison with the millionaire mansions of
Malibu or the exclusive resorts to the south in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Hermosa, "downscale" just means a little more
down-to-earth. Flip-flops, not leather sandals. French fries, not
pommes frites.</TE>
<TE>   Local bars such as Brewski's and Aloha Sharkeez (specializing in
"Hawaiian-Mex" food) draw throngs of partygoers in a sort of endless
post-college spring break. But my partner, Todd, and I were more
interested in biking along the coastal path known simply as the
Strand and holing up in a Beach House we could call ours, if only for
a couple of days.</TE>
<TE>   We left Saturday morning, not returning until early Monday, in
hopes of three benefits. First, we could relax Friday with dinner out
and a movie instead of fast food and a SigAlert. Second, we could
sleep in Saturday at home, rather than wake up in a hotel with
checkout already looming a day away. Third, we could save money on
our second night because the Beach House, like many coastal hotels,
offers lower rates Sunday through Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   All three wishes came true, though with a glitch on No. 3. (More
on that later.) Come Saturday, we blitzed down the 405 midday and had
lunch in Hermosa at the Downtown Bakery Cafe. The chicken panini and
turkey on baguette were fine, but we were more interested in dessert:
for Todd, a strawberry tart; for me, three layers of dark chocolate
cake interspersed with a not-too-sweet chocolate mousse.</TE>
<TE>   From there we walked a block to our 4-year-old hotel, which really
has the breezy look of a beach house, albeit one with three stories
and 96 bedrooms, most with a full or partial ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   Last year the Beach House listed rates from $264 to $339 per
night. But the terrorist attacks, the recession and the addition of
45 new rooms tipped the supply-demand scale. The Beach House's Web
site this fall showed that standard off-season rates (good through
April) for nonview rooms had dropped as low as $224 per night Fridays
and Saturdays, $199 other nights. Recently announced holiday
specials, based on availability from now through Dec. 30, are even
better: Two- to four-night stays average $150 to $165 per night for
nonview rooms, $180 to $205 for an ocean view.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, these holiday deals weren't in effect when I made
reservations. Which brings me to my only criticism of an otherwise
fine operation: When I booked my room by phone, a reservations agent
said we would pay $224 for Saturday and $199 less 10% (an auto club
discount valid Sunday through Thursday) for our second night. But at
check-in, a different clerk informed me that the hotel offers no such
discount. The price discrepancy wasn't resolved until checkout two
days later, when the general manager, who was unaware I'm a
journalist, graciously offered to charge $199 each night in lieu of
the auto club discount on one night.</TE>
<TE>   All these minutiae about prices were irrelevant because the hotel,
whether $150 or $199 or $224 a night, is worth its full price. The
attention to detail -- often practical, occasionally whimsical --
goes a long way toward convincing guests that they're buying more
than a prime beachfront location.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit A, the bed: It induced sleep with a mountain of down
pillows and a billowy, cloud-white duvet.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit B, the sunken sitting area and wet bar: The chair and
sleeper sofa faced a wood-burning fireplace already prepped with a
Duraflame log. Stove, microwave, coffeemaker, plates and utensils,
and a mini refrigerator (free bottled water inside) were
unobtrusively woven into the room design.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibit C, the granite bathroom: Here lay a rubber ducky for the
oversize tub, a separate shower, Aveda bath products, the suite's
fourth phone (though it didn't seem connected) and washcloth origami:
towels folded into the improbable forms of a seashell, a starfish and
a sailboat.</TE>
<TE>   Guests seeking fine china or enough space to cartwheel across the
living room may be disappointed. I peeked into half a dozen rooms,
and all had virtually the same cozy layout -- even the pricier
oceanfront units. We thought our third-floor room overlooking a side
street was fine. When we wanted to see the beach, we went to the
beach, which took all of 52 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   And that's truly the draw: location, location, location. So
Saturday afternoon we rented one-speed cruisers from Hermosa Cyclery,
next door to the hotel, and pedaled north along the Strand into
Manhattan Beach. Along the way we passed the nutty amalgamation that
is beach city architecture: Southwestern adobes, Northwest lodges,
Cape Cods, Victorians that look lifted from San Francisco's Alamo
Square.</TE>
<TE>   We saw other reminders of what makes this place unique. A 30ish
blond surfer dude skateboarded by with a blond baby cradled in his
arms. A leftover Halloween jack-o'-lantern was carved to depict a
surfer under a killer wave's curl.</TE>
<TE>   We returned the bikes, checked out the view from Hermosa's
409-yard pier, then walked to the foot of Pier Avenue. The pedestrian
plaza here was renovated in 1997, much to the consternation of some
locals, who feared an invasion of high-end boutiques and bistros
would change the town's low-key character. Downtown has been
prettified but retains enough of a scruffy, everyman spirit.</TE>
<TE>   We settled for a late, leisurely Italian dinner at the Bottle Inn,
where we each gained 3 pounds just reading the menu.</TE>
<TE>   We started with wine and the house specialty appetizer, toasted
focaccia topped with prosciutto and zucchini sauteed in sherry and
bechamel, then draped in melted fontina and mozzarella. The chicken
entrees that followed were fine. For Todd, fesa di pollo Trastevere,
a breast pounded thin, breaded and sauteed with lemon and garlic. For
me, pollo imbottito, a breast stuffed with prosciutto, porcini
mushrooms and cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The past, the present, the park</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning I made myself at home on our deck, complimentary
Tazo tea in one hand and a complimentary Sunday paper in the other.
Later we walked down to the hotel's complimentary breakfast in a room
facing the Strand.</TE>
<TE>   With our stomachs full, we walked into the past at the Hermosa
Beach Historical Society's makeshift museum behind the Hermosa Beach
Playhouse. The trip through time started with the vote to incorporate
on Dec. 24, 1906 (24 yes, 23 no). Then came a parade of historical
photographs and news clippings. We saw the grand Surf &amp; Sand Club
(later the Hermosa Biltmore Hotel), built in the 1920s near where the
Beach House and a small park now sit, and the 1926 Bijou Theater, a
space that now seats customers of Cold Stone Creamery and Coffee Bean
&amp; Tea Leaf.</TE>
<TE>   Good Stuff, a burger joint next to the hotel, served up a lunch of
two teriyakis -- one chicken sandwich, one hamburger. Both were
adequate. Better were the fries and chocolate shake. Best was the
beachfront view. We moved on to the eclectic shops along upper Pier
Avenue. Depending on your interests, you can browse
mid-century-modern furniture, hipster clothing, hand-blown art-glass
bongs or organic soap.</TE>
<TE>   Avante Card and 2 Doors Down, a couple of adjoining gift shops,
kept shoppers entertained with items like the Jesus action figure
("with posable arms"). More respectable fare was packed inside the
Stars Antique Market. We didn't stay long. As soon as Todd saw that
his childhood Uncle Sam piggy bank was old enough for an antiques and
collectibles store, we split.</TE>
<TE>   Dessert at the pleasant Java Man coffeehouse didn't make us feel
any younger, and neither did the walk along the sliver of parkway
that runs through the center of town. But we still loved the park,
which follows the corridor where the Pacific Electric rail tracks
once lay. The wide, mulched path is shaded by trees and lined with
wildflowers.</TE>
<TE>   We followed the tranquil walk with a soak in the Beach House's
spa. By the time dinner rolled around, we were feeling too indolent
to go far, so we walked a block to Cantina Real. Two margaritas, one
great enchiladas plate and one not-so-great carnitas platter later,
we headed back "home."</TE>
<TE>   Monday morning would mean returning to reality. But before leaving
our Beach House, I joined the dog walkers and the in-line skaters,
the sea gull feeders and the lucky locals who simply hop over their
patio wall to reach the beach. It was the best Monday morning in a
long, long time.</TE>

<LD>Birds and bird-watchers are flocking to the newly restored
Carpinteria Marsh. Two of the most visible visitors are the brown
pelican and the osprey, which dive like fighter jets into the muddy
channels.</LD>
<LD>   They're a welcome sight because the Carpinteria Salt Marsh Nature
Park is a remnant of a wetland that used to be miles wide, extending
from the Santa Ynez Mountains to the Pacific. A century of draining,
filling and developing diminished the marsh to just 230 acres. Even
downtown Carpinteria stands on former marshland.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few years ago the estuary was an eyesore, a wasteland of
weeds and an unofficial dump site. But after the removal of tons of
fill dirt and debris and the planting of thousands of native plants,
the marsh has rebounded. With development halted and limited water
flow restored, the marsh healed itself.</LD>
<TE>   Today the land is under the stewardship of the University of
California reserve system. Every Saturday, 90-minute docent-led tours
begin at 10 a.m. at the nature park entrance.</TE>
<TE>   You can see habitat for resident and migratory waterfowl as well
as a nursery for halibut and other fish. Herons, egrets and the
long-billed curlew are among the more commonly seen birds in the
reserve, where more than 200 species have been identified. Among them
are endangered or threatened species such as the light-footed clapper
rail.</TE>
<TE>   To reach Carpinteria Salt Marsh Nature Park, exit Highway 101 at
Linden Avenue and drive south 0.7 mile. Just before the avenue ends
at Carpinteria City Beach, turn right (east) on Sandyland Road. Drive
three blocks to Ash Avenue and the entrance to the marsh. Park along
Ash.</TE>
<TE>   Near the park entrance you will find an amphitheater, restrooms,
interpretive signs and trails. For a mile-long walk, meander north on
the path that skirts the western edge of the wetland. Turn west
alongside a mobile home park to the banks of Carpinteria Creek. Most
visitors turn around here, though a pathway continues inland along
the creek.</TE>
<TE>   After exploring the marsh, hit the beach. You can walk for miles
south along Carpinteria City Beach and Carpinteria State Beach.</TE>

<HD>Heightening safety, security at top of hotels' to-do lists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Long before Sept. 11, safety was a concern among hotel guests -- one
exploited in such classic movie thrillers as Alfred Hitchcock's
"Psycho" and Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining." The fictional Bates
Motel and the Overlook Hotel had safety issues far more profound than
secure locks or fire sprinklers.</LD>
<LD>   Since the attacks on the World Trade Center, safety and security
have become a "top-of-the-mind matter for hotel guests and managers
alike," says Cathy Enz, executive director of the Center for
Hospitality Research at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   She and an associate, Masako Taylor, have recently completed an
analysis of safety features at more than 2,100 U.S. lodgings. An
architecture firm and a fledgling company that created a safety
standard for U.S. hotels also have examined the issue. Here are some
of their findings and thoughts:</LD>
<TE>   Security equipment:  Enz and Taylor looked at whether hotels
reported having such safety devices as sprinklers, smoke detectors,
electronic locks, interior corridors (considered safer than external
walkways because access is more limited), security cameras and safety
literature and videos. They gathered their information from a 2001
survey for the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Assn. Two scores were
developed: one for safety, focused on fire and accident prevention,
and one for security, focused on theft and crime prevention. Hotels
got points on a 100-point scale based on how many of the safety
devices they had.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, hotels averaged 66% on the safety index and 60% on
the security index. Both figures jump into the 80s when hotels less
than 14 years old with more than 150 rooms are considered, Enz says.</TE>
<TE>   Based on these findings, you're more apt to find key safety and
security equipment at a large, new, luxury hotel near an airport than
at a small, vintage resort or bed-and-breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   Hotels with 250 or more rooms averaged in the high 70s on both
indexes; those with 20 to 39 rooms averaged 48% on safety and 26% on
security. Hotels less than 7 years old averaged in the high 70s on
both indexes; those 29 years or older scored 57% on safety and 47% on
security.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury hotels averaged 82% on the safety index, 79% for security;
economy hotels scored in the 60s. Rated by type of hotel, those near
airports averaged in the high 70s on both indexes; resorts averaged
61% on safety, 46% on security.</TE>
<TE>   Enz readily acknowledges her study has limits. It may overestimate
preparedness because hotels with key equipment may have been more
likely to answer the survey's security questions than those without.
Security depends on other factors besides equipment, she notes. A
small B&amp;B that uses keys in a residential neighborhood may be more
secure than a large airport hotel with electronic locks because the
B&amp;B owner can easily monitor who is a guest and who is not.</TE>
<TE>   Tips from business travelers: In an unscientific but intriguing
survey, Atlanta-based hospitality architects John Portman &amp;
Associates e-mailed about 13,000 Fortune 1000 business executives
about their security preferences. About 1% responded, said Vice
President Ellis Katz.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to rate hotel security in general from 1 to 10, 70% rated it
a 6 or above.</TE>
<TE>   But they did have concerns. More than half said they look for a
hotel room below the 10th floor and parking facilities adjacent to
the hotel instead of underneath. (Security experts suggest avoiding
rooms above the 10th floor because many fire ladders can't reach that
high, and rooms on the first floor because they are easier to break
into.)</TE>
<TE>   About three-fourths would like to have cameras outside their door,
with a monitor in their room to show who's outside, and an in-room
"panic button" that alerts the front desk to problems.</TE>
<TE>   And 80% would be willing to spend 5% or more for a room with
better security. "Security-conscious travelers are willing to pay for
added security features," Katz concludes.</TE>
<TE>   A safety seal of approval: John C. Fannin III has a vision and a
company. Now all he needs are clients.</TE>
<TE>   Fannin, former president of a consulting firm specializing in fire
protection and security, now heads SafePlace Corp. in Wilmington,
Del., which aims to become a nationwide independent accreditor of
hotel safety and security standards.</TE>
<TE>   Applicants submit to an on-site inspection by SafePlace that
considers not just safety equipment but also whether there are
policies and procedures to use it correctly. Hotels that pass get a
shield they can display in the lobby and on literature. So far, only
the AAA Four Diamond-rated Hotel du Pont in Wilmington has been
accredited, although Fannin says hundreds have inquired about
inspections. But he has some interesting points about security.</TE>
<TE>   Fire safety is governed by local codes, but there are no national
standards for which security features hotels should have, such as
electronic locks and video cameras, he says. (AAA-rated hotels must
provide "adequate illumination" in public areas and equip guest rooms
with deadbolt locks, primary locks and either door peepholes or a
"window convenient to the door.")</TE>
<TE>   "People require more safety standards of their toaster than they
do a hotel," Fannin contends.</TE>
<TE>   Without policies and a vigilant staff, security equipment is
nearly useless, he adds. He cites a friend who, armed with an
electronic key card, recently walked into his assigned Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., hotel room, and found a couple already checked in
there. The clerk then gave him a key card to a different room -- and
let him keep the old card.</TE>
<TE>   Fannin suggests hotel customers ask tough questions when reserving
a room and on arrival. These include: Is there a well-trained
security staff on site 24 hours a day? Are criminal background checks
and drug tests performed on every employee?</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Fannin about the most common security precaution that
hotels neglect, his answer was simple: hiring credible staff.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>DON'T get me wrong: I love my family. I just hate spending
Thanksgiving with them.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just me. Sixty percent of Americans think they need a
vacation after a holiday family visit, and 10% say they would rather
eat a fruitcake than spend a week with their in-laws, according to a
recent survey by the travel Web site Expedia.com.</LD>
<LD>   So why are we getting on a crowded plane two days before
Thanksgiving? My husband, Andy, has asked me that at least six times.
He would prefer to stay home, run in the local turkey trot race and,
not incidentally, save the money.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, it's not his family. We're going for the same reason
many of you -- about 37 million, according to AAA -- will be bucking
traffic and negotiating airport security, traveling 50 miles or more
from home. We're going to reconnect with the relatives, sharing the
same Thanksgiving dishes we prepare every year. (Doesn't anyone ever
get tired of creamed onions?) We want the kids to spend time with
cousins and aunts and uncles -- whether they want to or not.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us will have new babies, new fiances or spouses to show
off. Others, grappling with a recent death, divorce or lost job, will
struggle to put up a brave front. We'll laugh, and we'll probably
fight. Certainly, we'll eat and drink too much.</TE>
<TE>   At least 80% of us will drive, renting a car if necessary. "It
will be easier with the baby than dealing with the airport," says my
cousin Jayme Sitzman, who plans to drive from Denver to Las Vegas to
join the family. Maybe it's a sign of how much times have changed
that new parents would rather drive with an infant for 10-plus hours
than navigate a busy airport. It's also probably a sign of these
troubled times that so many of us believe it's important to make the
time-consuming and often emotionally taxing trek to see family rather
than taking off for Disney World, getting in some early-season skiing
or grabbing some of those cheap fares to London. Too bad the holiday
doesn't always play out like a Jimmy Stewart movie or a Norman
Rockwell painting.</TE>
<TE>   "You may be a successful adult, and all of a sudden you're a
middle child again, or the child who never lived up to a parent's
hopes and expectations," says Dr. David Fassler, a Vermont child and
adolescent psychiatrist.</TE>
<TE>   Just the anticipation of a family visit can be stressful. That's
why so many of us get grouchy in the weeks beforehand, Fassler says.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the trip itself: the kids wild from too much sugar
and too little sleep, the well-meaning aunt offering misguided
child-rearing advice, the teens sulking because they miss their
friends and the sisters-in-law, fueled by too much wine, saying
things they will regret.</TE>
<TE>   We've all been there. I've walked through the airport the Sunday
after Thanksgiving muttering, "Never again." My kids usually laugh.
They know I don't mean it.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily I've discovered that it is possible to stay calm -- and
maybe even have a good time. It always helps if you can get away from
the gang for a while, despite the possibility that your family, like
mine, may complain you're not helping enough. Too bad. Plan to visit
an old friend, take a walk, go shopping or stop by a local health
club.</TE>
<TE>   "Avoid situations where you will feel trapped, like being in the
suburbs without a car," Fassler says.</TE>
<TE>   Get the kids out of the fray too. Go to a playground, a movie or a
nearby children's museum or science center. (For directories, visit
the Web site of the Assn. for Children's Museums at
www.childrensmuseums.org. or the Assn. of Science-Technology Centers
at www.astc.org.)</TE>
<TE>   Take construction paper, scissors and markers so you can put the
littlest cousins to work making table decorations and place cards.
They will forget what they were fighting about. Encourage the older
ones to help cook. Where's that oatmeal cookie recipe you used to
help your grandmother make? Maybe the kids want to prepare something
different, starting a new tradition. I'll bet that vegetarian niece
has a few ideas.</TE>
<TE>   If you can afford it, spring for a hotel. You will enjoy the visit
more. There are lots of deals to choose from. Homewood Suites by
Hilton offers rates starting as low as $69 that include breakfast and
coupons good for free movie videos. Call (800) 225-5466 or visit
www.homewoodsuites.com. Some Hyatt resorts offer a free night with a
minimum stay, as well as $100 to spend on resort activities. Rates
start at $149. Call (800) 233-1234 or visit www.hyatt.com. The
cousins will work off some energy in the hotel pool. Even better, you
won't have to share a bathroom with five relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Pass the cranberry sauce.</TE>

<KH>Destination: Australia</KH>
<HD>Really roughing it in the outback</HD>
<DH>On a four-wheel drive into the wild Kimberley, adventurers
encounter otherworldly landscapes as well as crocs, bats and assorted
creepy creatures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Herron</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Kimberley, Australia</DL>
<LD>A sickening sensation tickled the pit of my stomach as our truck
plunged over the lip of a dry riverbed, jarred along its stony bottom
and lurched up the other side. It was the 50th gully we had crossed
in three hours. My heart was in my mouth, and my backside ached.</LD>
<LD>   My suffering was so distracting that I barely noticed the large
Toyota Land Cruiser barreling around the next bend, bearing down on
us for a head-on collision. Luckily, our driver, Glen Steggles, was
paying more attention. He swerved off the track at the last second,
narrowly avoiding the Toyota and plunging us into the thick
undergrowth. A sharp metallic crack rang through the cab as we ran
headlong into some boulders. We skidded to a dusty halt and clambered
out to inspect the damage. The car bore a jagged scar on its
underbelly and a large dent in the foot rail. "Not too bad," I said,
nodding approval, and we continued on our way. This kind of thing
happened all the time in the Kimberley.</LD>
<TE>   The Kimberley has been called Australia's last frontier, and with
good reason. The 140,000-square-mile wilderness in the far northwest
is buttressed on one side by the Great Sandy Desert and on the other
by an uninhabited coastline. It is home to only 25,000 people, making
it one of the least densely populated places on Earth. Furthermore,
at least 30% of those people are of aboriginal descent -- 10 times
the national average. European civilization has barely made a mark
here.</TE>
<TE>   The main reason is the weather: a monsoon climate whose two
seasons have a Jekyll-and-Hyde relationship, varying from baking
aridity in the winter to knock-'em-down storms and widespread
flooding in the summer. In the Wet, from November to April, easily
forded rivers become mile-wide torrents, the temperature soars to a
stifling 110 degrees and all but air traffic comes to a standstill.
During the Dry, travel is possible, but only on an isolated network
of rough dirt roads. And that's what draws most visitors: the
glorious isolation, the rugged beauty of a wilderness that will never
be tamed.</TE>
<TE>   That was what stuck in my mind on my first trip to Australia in
2001, under a yearlong working visa program available to British
citizens. I longed to explore Australia's wildest places from the
moment I set foot on the continent.</TE>
<TE>   While working as a waiter in Sydney, I met several like-minded
travelers in their mid-20s, including Glen. The Aussie just happened
to own a new SUV and was keen to test its mettle. We quit our jobs
and cruised off into the outback with three others, Tamsin Hoare,
Katharine Sidenius and Chris Tanner.</TE>
<TE>   We arrived in Broome -- a bohemian town on the West Kimberley
coast renowned for its long white sand beaches -- in June 2001, four
months and several thousand miles after leaving Sydney. Our journey
had already taken in many of Australia's highlights, but we knew that
the real adventure would begin 180 miles farther west, when our steel
radials first bit into the dirt of the Gibb River Road, a 417-mile
track that crosses the heart of the Kimberley between Broome and
Kununurra. We would not see asphalt again for more than 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   The Kimberley's isolation makes it one of the great bastions of
modern aboriginal culture, which has a deep and intimate connection
to the land. If you travel with a knowledgeable aboriginal guide, you
will probably hear countless stories of "The Dreaming," the
aboriginal creation myth. Its colorful tales of supernatural animals
and ancient ancestors who created the Earth pervade the landscape,
breathing mystery and spirituality into every rock and tree.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking vestiges of these beliefs are the mysterious
Wandjina paintings, more than 10,000 years old, which adorn rock
galleries all over the Kimberley. These enigmatic figures with large
white heads, dark oval eyes and long straight noses represent the
protectors of the aboriginal people.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most dramatic story from the creation is that of
Wunggud, an enormous serpent that swam in from the ocean at the
beginning of the Dreaming. She burrowed deep into the Earth with her
powerful body, tearing rifts and tunnels in the solid bedrock that
collapsed to form deep valleys and gorges. Water flowed in from the
ocean in her wake, creating the rivers that crisscross the Kimberley
today.</TE>
<TE>   This story seemed perfectly plausible at our first stop along Gibb
River Road. Here the mighty Lennard River had sliced open and punched
holes through the limestone foundation of the Napier Range with an
awesome power. Spectacular rock formations -- the sheer walls of
Wandjina Gorge and the dark caverns of Tunnel Creek -- dominated the
scenery.</TE>
<TE>   Tunnel Creek was a half-mile underground river that had bored its
way through a mountain. In the Wet it can flood at any minute, but in
the Dry you can walk along its sandy banks, wading intermittently
through cold, still water. The tunnel's high walls are rough and
rounded. It wasn't hard to imagine the body of Wunggud slithering
through, her scales rasping along the rocky walls.</TE>
<TE>   Deep in the tunnel, it was as black as pitch and more than a
little spooky. A lone shaft of light pierced the gloom from a hole in
the roof. Our pulses quickened when dozens of bats wheeled through
the air, fluttering close to our heads.</TE>
<TE>   Wandjina Gorge was no less unsettling. Jagged black walls 300 feet
high, the limestone remnants of a prehistoric coral reef, towered
over a series of shallow pools -- all that remains of the Lennard
River in the Dry. Each pool was crammed with crocodiles. Rough, scaly
bodies splashed in the water, and the hissing and snapping of
fighting males reverberated throughout the gorge. The water looked
cool and refreshing in the soaring heat of the day, but no one cared
to get in the middle of a croc fight.</TE>
<TE>   That night, while preparing dinner at the Wandjina Gorge campsite,
we became aware of something moving around us. Twigs cracked;
something moved beneath the tall grass. Suddenly a succession of loud
metallic pings resounded from every vehicle in the campsite.</TE>
<TE>   Before we knew it, thousands of crickets, as large as a man's
finger, bombarded us like a barrage of microscopic artillery. They
ricocheted off our skulls, ensnared themselves in our hair and
crawled up the backs of our shirts. We were no matches for such a
biblical swarm, so we grabbed our dinners and fled to our tents.</TE>
<TE>   Once the drama was over, sleep found us quickly. We lay beside the
campfire with heavy eyelids, watching the orange embers slowly fade
to black. A gentle symphony of night sounds filtered through the
undergrowth -- the baritone of croaking frogs, the high chirping of
crickets, the rhythmic flutter of bat wings overhead.</TE>
<TE>   I rolled onto my back and gazed at the Milky Way, brighter than I
had ever seen it before. It filled my dreams as I drifted off to
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Sacred pools</TE>
<TE>   Where the Earth Snake came to rest, pools of water formed between
her coils: sacred water holes that the aboriginals know as Wunggud
places. They are the jewels of the Kimberley, where crystalline
shards of water explode over blood red cliffs and still pools reflect
the cobalt sky like a mirror. The aboriginals believe that great
powers dwell in the waters. People come to Wunggud places to be cured
of sickness; pregnant women come so that the spirit of their unborn
child may enter its body through the water.</TE>
<TE>   In time, we too came to revere them. There were no hotels on the
dusty trail beyond Wandjina Gorge. All campgrounds were rough
affairs, with pit toilets and, most important, no showers. After a
long, hot day of driving, the virgin waters of Bell Gorge, Manning
Gorge, Galvan Gorge or any of the other little oases that lined the
road became our daily salvation from the searing heat of the Dry.</TE>
<TE>   Barely would the car come to a halt before we were tearing off our
clothes and leaping into the cooling waters. They soothed our bodies
and revitalized our minds in a way that really did seem magical. Days
slipped idly by as we lazed in the shade of pandanus trees, showered
in crystal cascades and sought refuge from the searing heat beneath
the glassy waters.</TE>
<TE>   So far the drive on the newly graded Gibb River Road had been
pretty easy. Our needle hovered at a steady 50 mph, and the endless
expanses of Kimberley country -- rocky yellow plains, dry stunted
forest and cloudless blue skies -- blew by in a blur.</TE>
<TE>   That became a dim memory as we left the Gibb River Road and turned
south toward Purnululu National Park (also known as the Bungle Bungle
Mountains), the last stop on our journey. After a brief stretch of
asphalt, the roadway became a mess of corrugations. The car shook for
endless hours, as if someone were pounding on the roof with a
pneumatic drill.</TE>
<TE>   As we drew closer to the park, things got even stickier. A season
of flood and rain had cleaved deep gullies and washouts into the
gravel track. In several places the road was so mangled that we got
out of the car and onto our hands and knees, surveying every possible
angle to figure out how we were going to make it through. Our speed
dropped to 15 mph, and we spent the rest of the afternoon bouncing
around the inside of the cabin like the beads in maracas.</TE>
<TE>   Night fell, and we were still far from our destination. Driving in
the dark was unsettling. Twisted branches, bleached a ghostly white
in the halogen flare of our spotlights, loomed at us by the roadside.
Dozens of tiny eyes glinted at the edge of our vision. Our relief was
palpable an hour later, when we first saw the friendly sight of cars
and tents at the Bungle Bungles' campsite. Too exhausted to set up
camp, we unrolled our sleeping mats on the rocky ground and fell
immediately into a hard slumber.</TE>
<TE>   In the secret garden</TE>
<TE>   I awoke suddenly the next morning to the piercing howl of a dingo.
The sun had not yet risen, and the air was cool and heavy. A fine
white mist shrouded the meadows, as if an ancient spirit were
clinging to the pale trunks of the trees. But when its first rays
struck the land, everything burst to life. The white trunks of ghost
gums blazed orange and yellow. The tall termite mounds that studded
the plains glistened like gold.</TE>
<TE>   Striped orange domes of sandstone, like a metropolis of giant
beehives, grew up from the dry earth. One would be as perfectly
smooth and rounded as a giant stone egg; its neighbor would be
peppered with holes. Exposed outcrops and slender pinnacles were
warped and twisted until they resembled animals or deformed human
faces.</TE>
<TE>   Purnululu National Park was endlessly surprising and bizarre. The
park was virtually unknown, even to Australians, until the mid-1980s,
when filmmakers first revealed the scenic delights hidden within its
high sandstone ridges and cavernous gorges. Many of its 1,200 square
miles remain unexplored, and it is one of the least developed parks
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Our night's sleep had us feeling sufficiently recovered to
undertake an overnight hike through Picaninny Gorge, into the heart
of the sandstone massif.</TE>
<TE>   The dry riverbeds were a natural labyrinth, riddled with a maze of
shallow channels and deep gullies. It was as if a deranged sculptor
had been set loose with a hammer and chisel. I couldn't shake the
feeling that I was walking through an old "Star Trek" set.</TE>
<TE>   The morning cool soon faded, and the sun beat down ferociously.
Every rock sizzled like a hot plate; every footfall kicked up clouds
of choking dust. The parched spinifex grass that covered the floor
scraped and jabbed at our legs like a forest of surgical needles.
Suddenly even a six-mile hike started to look quite unpleasant.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, we soon were staring into the narrow entrance to
Picaninny Gorge, a dark alley flanked by twin skyscrapers of red
rock. We continued into the blessed shade.</TE>
<TE>   The air inside the gorge was cool and heavy. Its walls soared 600
feet above us, filling our vision in all directions. Its surface was
rough and irregular, scarred by the millenniums-long battle between
water and earth that resulted in its creation. Dwarfish palms and
emaciated gum trees clung to the vertical walls.</TE>
<TE>   As we went deeper, the vegetation grew steadily thicker. Soon we
were pushing our way through thickets of eucalyptus, towered over by
Livistonia palms, their fronds caressing the red sandstone walls. I
felt as if we had discovered a secret garden.</TE>
<TE>   We spent our final night in the gorge, tossing our sleeping bags
on the sandy riverbed right where we stood.</TE>
<TE>   I had been asleep for a few hours when I was woken by a faint
scratching coming from the sand beneath me. Lifting up my sleeping
bag, I was startled to see dozens of tiny green heads poking up from
the sand -- frogs that had been passing the dry season in the damp
subsoil of the riverbed. Their eyes momentarily flicked left and
right before they hopped off into the bush.</TE>
<TE>   It was the perfect metaphor for the Kimberley. At first it can
seem a parched and unforgiving wilderness. But just below the
surface, there is an inextinguishable life force that will surprise
and delight.</TE>
<TE>   The aboriginals call this force Yorro Yorro: a constantly
recurring process of creation and rebirth. Each day it revitalizes
and renews the Kimberley. It did the same to me.</TE>

breath away, just as it did when I first saw Akaroa a year ago. It is
truly a Shangri-La setting. The ride to get there takes 1 1/2
stomach-churning hours through some of the most beautiful New Zealand

<LD>Going away for the holidays? Now is a good time to brush up on the
new rules of travel, before you leave for the airport. To help you,
the federal Transportation Security Administration, which coordinates
security at U.S. airports, has posted tips at the Internet site
www.TSATravelTips.us.</LD>
<LD>   The information is similar to what had been posted on www.tsa.gov.
But it is more concise and conveniently organized, with quick links
to topics such as prohibited and permitted items, travel preparation
and security procedures. The list of what's naughty and nice to carry
on is neatly divided into categories such as personal items,
electronic devices and sharp objects. A section called "Special
Considerations" includes tips on traveling with children, pets and
film.</LD>
<LD>   National Airlines shuts down, refuses refunds</LD>
<TE>   Passengers were left scrambling after Las Vegas-based National
Airlines abruptly shut down Nov. 6. The discount airline, which ran
flights between the gambling mecca and various cities, including Los
Angeles and San Francisco, had operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for most of its 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   The airline said it would not issue refunds. Last week on its Web
site, www.nationalairlines.com, it suggested they seek refunds from
their credit card companies or ask to be accommodated on other
airlines. More information can be found at
airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/cessations/national.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Snow brings early skiing to Colorado</TE>
<TE>   Colorado ski resorts have pushed up their opening dates after
getting early snow. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   Vail Mountain moved its opening date to this weekend from Nov. 22
after record snowfalls of more than 6 feet since September, it said.
Snowmass opened Nov. 9, Winter Park was to have opened last week and
Aspen Mountain was to have opened Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Mammoth Mountain opened Nov. 7. In the Lake Tahoe
area, Alpine Meadows was to have opened Thursday and Kirkwood,
Northstar-at-Tahoe and Squaw Valley on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a train through the pineapple fields</TE>
<TE>   Visitors to Oahu can chug through the fruit fields of Hawaii's
Dole Plantation aboard a new diesel train.</TE>
<TE>   The four-car Pineapple Express, built in England, takes tourists
on a 20-minute, two-mile spin through several acres of pineapple,
banana, coffee and other fields. Along the way they learn about the
history of the plantation and Hawaiian agriculture. (The train tour
replaces a short-lived bus tour that ended last month.)</TE>
<TE>   Tours run 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Tickets are $7.50 for adults,
$5.50 for ages 4 to 12 and free for children younger than 4. The
plantation is about a 40-minute drive from Waikiki, at 64-1550
Kamehameha Highway. (808) 621-8408, www.dole-plantation.com.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's note</TE>
<TE>   The State Department recently updated its earlier worldwide
caution, warning of possible "retaliatory attacks against American
interests overseas" after the execution of convicted terrorist Mir
Aimal Kansi, scheduled last week in Virginia. Kansi, a Pakistani, was
convicted in the 1993 murders of two CIA employees. The caution
expires May 7.</TE>

starting at $339 per person, double occupancy, including all meals,
one night's lodging in Kamloops and a musical revue. Air fare is
extra.</TE>
<TE>   Singles pay $38 more each; the child fare, ages 2 to 11, is $135.
The same trip starts at $478 per adult in peak season, June to
October. The train travels about 600 miles one way between Vancouver

<HD>Bora-Bora, but not for hoi polloi</HD>
<DH>A new South Pacific resort's 'huts' offer luxurious touches
and high-tech amenities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An over-the-water, all-suite resort billing itself as the ultimate
luxury resort in French Polynesia is opening in phases on the island
of Bora-Bora.</LD>
<LD>   The $60-million Bora Bora Nui Resort &amp; Spa, operated by Starwood
Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc., had opened about 50 of its
thatch-roofed two-room suites as of last week. The rest are expected
to be completed by mid-December. Eighty-four of the 120 planned units
will be over the water, with the rest on the beachfront or hillside.</LD>
<LD>   The water suites have glass floor panels for viewing the sea life
below, plus a balcony and a dock. Guests can have room-service
breakfast delivered by canoe, with singing crew.</LD>
<TE>   Over-the-water bungalows are not unusual in the islands, but on
Bora-Bora they're typically modest in size and lack air-conditioning.
At the new Starwood resort, the suites are 1,000 square feet, with
three "royal" suites measuring 1,500 square feet. Spokeswoman Kim
Marshall calls them "high-tech huts." They have air-conditioning,
satellite TV, computer data ports, CD players and Indonesian mahogany
interiors. Each bathtub is carved from a single block of Italian
marble; bath fixtures are French silver.</TE>
<TE>   There are several restaurants and bars, hot tubs and an infinity
pool. A Mandara Spa is to open in mid-December.</TE>
<TE>   Guests take a 20-minute water taxi ride to the resort from the
Bora-Bora airport. The island is a 45-minute flight from Papeete on
Tahiti, capital of French Polynesia.</TE>
<TE>   Published rates begin at $500 per night. The top rate is $1,885
for an over-the-water royal suite. Marshall, who returned from a
visit last weekend, reported "lots of Japanese honeymooners" at the
resort and said Christmas week was nearly sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Introductory rates, which must be booked by Nov. 30 for travel
through Dec. 20, start at $377 a night, with a three-night minimum.

<HD>Time for a splurge in S.F.</HD>
<DH>In a buyers' market, you can get luxury for less at some of
the city's finest lodgings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beverly Beyette</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>San Francisco</DL>
<LD>Luxury hotels in this city all but have "on sale" signs tacked to
their doors. All things are relative, of course, and at the four- and
five-star level, a room for two at $200 and lower is a steal.</LD>
<LD>   These days, it's also a reality.</LD>
<LD>   So if you're fed up with bounce-back foam pillows, coat hangers
permanently affixed to their rods and other annoyances of mid-priced
hotels, it may be time for a splurge in San Francisco, where tourism
has been hit hard by the dot-com collapse, the Sept. 11 fallout and a
resulting hotel room glut.</LD>
<TE>   To splurge is to step into a world of down pillows and duvets,
padded satin hangers, complimentary newspapers and shoeshines,
24-hour room service, luxurious linens and thirsty terry robes,
lighted magnifying mirrors, nightly turndown service and bonbons on
your pillow. Some of these hotels will even take Fido, though that
may add up to $75 to your bill.</TE>
<TE>   Although not all image-conscious establishments are eager to
advertise that they're doing deep discounting, anyone with a computer
and/or an auto club or American Express card can find good rates.
Some bargains are Internet only; a telephone call directly to hotels
often will yield rates that match those on the Web. But you must ask.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month I checked into five luxury hotels on five nights,
Monday through Friday: two grandes dames, the Fairmont and the
Palace, both of which have had multimillion-dollar renovations; the
Clift, transformed under new ownership; the recently renovated
Campton Place, a boutique hotel; and the year-old Four Seasons.</TE>
<TE>   My quest for good deals began on the Internet, where sites such as
Expedia, Orbitz and Travelocity post a dizzying range of rates for
the same rooms, typically moderate or standard doubles with king-size
beds. (Other good Web site sources are www.quikbook.com and
www.hotelres.com.) I then telephoned the hotels -- never identifying
myself as a Times travel writer -- and asked for their best rates.
The first rate quoted was rarely the best rate available. It took a
little persistence to get to the bottom line, but once I did, the
savings were substantial.</TE>
<TE>   Why this windfall? For two years straight, San Francisco has been
the hardest hit of any U.S. city. And with about 31,000 hotel rooms
to be filled, the dramatically decreased demand has created a buyers'
market.</TE>
<TE>   "People can come up from L.A. and get great hotel rates and
probably will be able to do so through the middle of the year," says
Gary Carr of PKF Consulting, which tracks such matters for the San
Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   PKF figures released last week show that, year to date, the
average daily room rate citywide is down 15.7% from 2001, and
occupancy is down too. In September, rates at high-end hotels ($160 a
day and up) averaged $199.62, down from $208.39 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Flying to San Francisco, I pondered how a bargain hunter would be
received at these posh hotels. Would I be treated like a refugee from
Motel 6, shuffled off to a dark cubicle next to the ice machine?</TE>
<TE>   The reality: Although several rooms were on the small side, all
were luxurious. All had down pillows -- usually four -- and most had
duvets. At most of the hotels, bells and whistles included in-room
high-speed Internet access, voicemail, irons and boards, in-room
movies ($10.99 to $12.99), CD players, two or three telephones,
including one in the bath, and mini-bars with overpriced snacks and
drinks (and, at the Clift, condoms). All but the Clift had ice
machines on each floor. Fitness and spa facilities ranged from a
canopied terrace with the standard exercise equipment (Campton Place)
to the state-of-the-art, 100,000-square-foot Sports Club/L.A. and
Splash spa at the Four Seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "Extras," such as overnight parking rates up to $45 and add-ons as
high as 75% for long-distance telephone calls, can quickly pad room
rates. It's good to keep in mind that the room rates do not include a
14% citywide tax.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what I found:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cozy, classy Campton Place</TE>
<TE>   Any fears of being treated like a second-class tourist were
dispelled the moment I walked into the 110-room Campton Place, a
little gem wrapped around an atrium with a Zen-inspired garden. This
boutique hotel, just off the newly spiffed-up Union Square, opened in
1983 in the former Drake-Wiltshire space and underwent a $15-million
renovation in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Published rates began at $335, but I paid $195.</TE>
<TE>   I was warmly welcomed by name and taken to my fifth-floor room,
which made up in amenities for what it lacked in space. Minimalist in
shades of beige, with rich pear wood, it had a spacious bath,
wonderful lighting and a double-paned window that shut out city
sounds.</TE>
<TE>   It was noontime, so I ducked around the corner to Maiden Lane,
where at Mocca, a little cash-only Italian cafe, the
sandwich-and-salad crowd included shoppers bearing bags from the chic
stores around Union Square and along Post Street.</TE>
<TE>   Room service prices, though daunting, are less than at some of the
other hotels. American breakfast -- bacon and eggs, juice, toast and
coffee -- is $19 plus $2 delivery charge, 15% gratuity and taxes. But
there's always Starbucks next door.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the reputation of the hotel's restaurant chef, Laurent
Manrique, I had booked a dinner reservation. This was the week's big
splurge -- about $100, including tip and a split of California
Sauvignon Blanc. With only 14 diners in a room for 65, I had a waiter
for every course. The halibut, three perfect medallions in a sauce of
diced tomatoes, black olives and capers, served on a bed of pureed
potatoes, didn't disappoint. And the homemade prune ice cream -- yes,
prune -- with Armagnac was memorable. The piece de resistance of the
room decor, San Francisco artist Nikolas Weinstein's glass
chandelier, was a bit baffling: wilting calla lilies, perhaps, or
some exotic sea anemone?</TE>
<TE>   Returning to my room, I found on the nightstand two Mrs. Fields
cookies, the next day's weather forecast and, on the floor by the
bed, a small mat and a pair of terry slippers with the hotel's
signature swan logo. I put my shoes outside my door; the next morning
they had been shined.</TE>
<TE>   It was inviting, friendly and intimate, with great service, a good
location just off Union Square and a tranquil Asian-inspired
ambience. Standard rooms are on the small side but have generous
baths. There's a top-echelon restaurant and a clubby bar.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Fairmont's fabulous face lift</TE>
<TE>   At the 591-room Fairmont, which last year completed an $85-million
restoration, I had booked a view room in the original low-rise for
$224.65 (recent rates began at $169 for the lowest-level room) but
was upgraded without explanation to a 16th-floor tower room with a
dazzling view. In greens and golds, it was big and formal, with
traditional dark wood furniture. The fringed moss green velvet
draperies recalled those from which Scarlett fashioned a costume to
beguile Rhett. Still, it was a lovely room, with generous marble bath
(tub and shower) and mirrors galore.</TE>
<TE>   Scanning the room service breakfast menu, I was reminded that
luxury has its price. Continental breakfast is $17, plus a $3.50
service charge, tax and a 17% gratuity. I opted out, having
discovered downstairs Espressions, where a bagel and coffee cost
$3.50. The rich may be different from you and me, but I noticed other
guests at these hotels engaging in small economies, such as
schlepping their own bags or eating at modestly priced places nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Even on Nob Hill, I spotted two small spots, Vicino and the Nob
Hill Cafe, at Clay and Taylor, only a short walk from the major
hotels. In the theater district, across Geary Street from the Clift,
are David's delicatessen, Max's and a California Pizza Kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The paucity of visitors to the city is evident, both in some of
the high-end shops and in the restaurants. At the Fairmont's kitschy
Tonga Room, which by popular demand has been little changed since
1945, there were a dozen guests on a Tuesday night. I ordered a mai
tai in a faux coconut shell and settled into a wicker chair to watch
the rain on the roof.</TE>
<TE>   After checking out of the Fairmont, I checked in with Jeff Doane,
the hotel's sales and marketing director, who took me on a tour from
the $10,000-a-night penthouse suite to the Venetian Room, where Tony
Bennett first sang in public "I Left My Heart in San Francisco." The
Fairmont's crowning glory is its Edwardian lobby, now ivory and gold,
with stately marble columns and gilded mirrors. "From 1945 to 1999,
this was a red and black hotel," said Doane as we crossed the lobby.
Gone are the black walls and the red velvet bordello decor, replaced
with sofas and chairs in soft cocoas. Gone too is the red and black
carpet, yanked up to expose the circa-1907 marble floor. In the
adjacent Laurel Court restaurant and lounge, false ceilings have been
removed to reveal lovely twin glass domes.</TE>
<TE>   This palatial landmark, very Old San Francisco, is for those who
prefer big hotels with elegant public rooms. There's good
people-watching from one of the greatest of all hotel lobbies. The
rooms are nicely sized, traditionally furnished, some with sweeping
views, and the Fairmont has an excellent Nob Hill location, cable
car-close to all.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The understated, elegant Four Seasons</TE>
<TE>   The next day I checked into the Four Seasons, a 277-room oasis of
privilege that occupies 12 floors of a 40-story residential high-rise
on Market Street. I paid $299; published rates begin at $469.</TE>
<TE>   It was built for $364 million and opened just a year ago. In the
fifth-floor lobby, geometric glass sculptures at either end of the
gilded 60-foot ceiling cast prisms of light. Contemporary works by
Northern California artists adorn walls of richly burnished wood.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood, although being gentrified, is still a mix, not
the best place for an evening stroll. But from the Four Seasons, the
fast-food joints and tacky storefronts, the buskers and beggars, seem
of another planet.</TE>
<TE>   I had a corner room with tall windows, a lavish bath with window
and deep tub, and a king bed with pillow-top mattress. The colors
were soothing: sage and buttery taupe, the Art Deco furnishings
handsome. I found a laminated card on an elastic string with a map of
suggested city jogging routes.</TE>
<TE>   One of the hotel's prides is its state-of-the-art Sports Club/L.A.
complex, which is free to guests. Occupying two levels, it has a
basketball court, restaurant and the Splash spa, where I booked a
50-minute massage with Heather ($85) and was soon relaxing on a
heated table while she pummeled and kneaded. I passed on the oxygen
facial and the soy and mud wrap.</TE>
<TE>   At the cocktail hour, the wood-paneled Living Room lounge off the
lobby adjacent to Seasons restaurant beckoned. Candles flickered in
the low light, and my drink came with a linen coaster and napkin. For
nibbling there were wasabi peanuts and olives. My club sandwich was
made with real turkey. Soon the house pianist, who had a fondness for
romantic tunes from the '40s, began playing to a largely empty room.</TE>
<TE>   The Four Seasons is stunning. It has generous rooms and baths,
exquisitely understated wood-paneled public rooms and friendly
service. There's some Market Street noise on lower floors. It's not
as convenient to theaters and shopping as some, but it's steps to San
Francisco Shopping Centre mall and other South of Market
destinations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Old World feel at the Palace</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I rolled my bag the two blocks to the 552-room
Palace, where, without asking, I was upgraded to a spacious $775
corner suite for which I paid $199. (Published rates begin at $590.)
The Palace, now a Starwood hotel, opened in 1875 and had become a bit
tired before being shuttered for a top-to-bottom renovation completed
in 1991 at a cost of $140 million. Now the glass-domed Garden Court,
one of the most beautiful of all hotel spaces, sparkles. Enjoying a
shrimp salad before check-in, I imagined onetime guests Sarah
Bernhardt or Oscar Wilde sitting beneath a potted palm.</TE>
<TE>   My suite, traditional with dark woods and blue and gold decor,
lacked nothing, though the bath was small, with a curtained
tub-shower combination. A corner desk in the living room overlooked a
tall, curved window with an ornamental iron rail. The corridors are
grandly wide, the original PH brass doorknobs on guest rooms brightly
polished.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, as I walked south from the hotel a few blocks to the
San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, I paused on Mission Street,
where, near 3rd Street, a queue had formed at A.G. Ferrari, an
Italian marketplace-deli from which came irresistible scents of
cheeses and olives. There were panini and salads to be eaten at
little round tables.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner that night I chose the light menu at the Palace's Pied
Piper Bar, where it's said Mark Twain used to lunch. Three hours
until midnight closing, it was almost empty. The Promenade, the grand
galleria that cuts through the hotel for most of a city block, was
deserted. Occupancy has been "up and down," said hotel sales
coordinator Liz Pasha, although half of October was sold out. When I
checked out, a doorman thanked me profusely "for staying with us."</TE>
<TE>   I left behind an elegant, Old World hotel with nicely sized rooms.
It's big and a bit impersonal. Like its neighbor the Four Seasons,
it's not as well situated for theater and shopping as some, but it is
close to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Gardens
and Moscone Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The oh-so-happening Clift</TE>
<TE>   Day 5 brought me to the theater district and the 375-room Clift,
home of the Art Deco Redwood Room, an icon for generations of San
Franciscans. The hotel, formerly a Four Seasons, is now owned by Ian
Schrager Hotels and reopened in July 2001 after a $25-million
makeover from which it says it emerged "a wonderland for the jet
set."</TE>
<TE>   Stepping through the tall glass doors is a bit like falling down
the rabbit hole. French designer Philippe Starck's eclectically
playful lobby accommodates a French bronze chair three times the size
of a normal chair; a Salvador Dali table; metal sculptures for
sitting; and an ostrich sofa with horns, created by French cartoonist
Michel Haillard. ("Yak horns," the concierge explained. "They're
shed, not killed.")</TE>
<TE>   My room was, to be charitable, cozy, the bath so small (4 1/2 by 6
1/2 feet) that there was no place to put anything. There was a
curtained shower-tub combination, and the plumbing was sluggish, the
shower running hot and cold. But the room had charm, with its
sycamore sleigh bed, yards of shimmery champagne draperies, little
chrome lamps and a lavender chair with a lavender throw and orange
plexiglass cubes for bedside tables. A crystal vase on the desk held
a stem of orchids. All this for $195; published rates begin at $325.</TE>
<TE>   The guest directory told me that, for $12 a night, I could rent a
DVD -- everything from "Gone With the Wind" to adult movies. CDs, $6
a night, ranged from Snoop Dogg to Tony Bennett singing you know
what. Absolut vodka was $95 a bottle from room service. (It's about
$30 at your local grocery.) There also was a you-gotta-be-kidding
price list for purchase of in-room amenities ($300 for that lavender
throw, $50 for a small, garden-variety hair dryer).</TE>
<TE>   When I called to reserve for a late dinner in the Redwood Room I
was told that, it being Friday, I'd have to take my chances. The
Redwood is as beautiful as ever, despite the Gustav Klimt
reproductions having been replaced by ever-changing digital art on
flat-screen TVs. On a Friday it's SRO, a hip young crowd, lots of
singles. I spotted a small brown leather sitting cube and moved it to
a spot against a wall. No sooner had I commandeered a tiny plastic
table than a man asked, covetously, "Is that a table or a seat?" It
was a table, and I wasn't giving it up. The canned music, some sort
of rock, was deafening. As passersby swept French fries off my plate,
I remembered with fondness the old Redwood Room, with its tinkling
piano and air of civility.</TE>
<TE>   At breakfast in the adjacent Asia de Cuba, Michael, my waiter,
literally danced to the table. (Yes, that music again.) It's hard to
believe this once was the stuffy French Room, all Louis Whatevers and
crystal chandeliers. Now it is an inviting extension of the Redwood,
with wood paneling, brown velvet draperies and leather banquettes
with tall fan-shaped backs. A 30-foot cross-shaped etched glass
table, lighted from beneath, with high bar stools for 24 guests, is
inspired.</TE>
<TE>   I ate my pancakes and checked out, off to look at more luxury
hotels.</TE>
<TE>   The Clift is decidedly eccentric and avant-garde, not for
traditionalists. It has a young, hip clientele and a friendly young
staff. Venture into the popular Redwood Room on a weekend night at
your own risk. Standard rooms and baths are small. It's well located
off Union Square in the heart of the theater district.</TE>

<TE>   The way to get a deal: Ask</TE>
<TE>   In search of more bargains, we checked out prices at a dozen other
traditionally pricey San Francisco hotels. Asking for a rate card
elicited one of two responses: There wasn't one because rates are in
flux, or there was one but the rates didn't apply. Clerks were almost
invariably happy to show a room.</TE>
<TE>   Grand Hyatt, 345 Stockton St., (415) 398-1234,
www.grandsanfrancisco.hyatt.com. At this 685-room convention-oriented
hotel just off Union Square, the clerk said, "Our rates change all
the time. I'm sure we'll be having some holiday specials." Regular
rates start at $169, but specials abound.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington, 1075 California St. on Nob Hill, (415) 474-5400,
www.huntingtonhotel.com. A clerk at the 135-room, family-owned hotel
handed over a rate card, scribbling reduced prices alongside printed
ones -- $310 for a luxury $455 double, $195 for the $310 superior
double.</TE>
<TE>   Mandarin Oriental, 222 Sansome St., (415) 276-9888,
www.mandarinoriental.com/sanfrancisco. The clerk at this 158-room
hotel wrote special holiday rates good through November and into
December alongside printed rates -- $250 for a $540 deluxe king, up
to $450 for the most spacious view king, listed at $725.</TE>
<TE>   Milano, South of Market at 55 5th St., www.hotelmilanosf.com,
(415) 543-8555. Rate cards have been removed at this 108-room hotel,
but the clerk quoted a range from $199 to $299, then advised asking
for park-and-stay specials.</TE>
<TE>   Nikko, 222 Mason St., (415) 394-1111, www.nikkohotels.com. "Rates
go up and down," a clerk said of the 532-room hotel. He offered a
November special of $159 a night for a king for a package that would
have cost $235, including free parking (usually $30) and a sake
martini.</TE>
<TE>   Nob Hill Lambourne, 725 Pine St., (415) 433-2287,
www.nobhilllambourne.com. "It's best to call. Rates vary these days,"
said the agent at this 20-room hotel. She offered a brochure, on
which she wrote a price of $189 for a deluxe queen and $219 for a
deluxe suite. All rooms have kitchenettes; rates include breakfast
and a wine-and-cheese hour.</TE>
<TE>   Pan Pacific, 500 Post St., (415) 771-8600, www.panpac.com. At this
330-room place, a cheerful agent produced a sheet showing rooms and
suites ranging from $365 to $2,500, then suggested calling in-house
reservations for a better rate and mentioned a Thanksgiving special
of $129 for a superior queen from Nov. 22 through 30.</TE>
<TE>   Renaissance Stanford Court, 905 California St. on Nob Hill, (415)
989-3500, www.marriott.com. No rate sheet was available for this
400-room hotel. "Rates constantly change, depending upon
availability," a clerk said. Regular rates start at $170, deluxe view
rooms at $199.</TE>
<TE>   Ritz-Carlton, 600 Stockton St., (415) 296-7465,
www.ritzcarlton.com. Only at the 336-room Ritz was a rate card handed
over with no comment. The lowest listed rate was $500 for a deluxe
room. A check of the hotel's Web site showed rooms starting at $355
and, through Dec. 30, a $369 as-available package with overnight
parking, American breakfast for two and a 25% discount certificate
for shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Marriott, 55 4th St., South of Market, (415)
896-1600, www.marriott.com. The 1,498-room hotel did not have a rate
card but quoted a special of $189 to $204 with breakfast for two,
adding, "It fluctuates from day to day."</TE>
<TE>   W, 181 3rd St., near Yerba Buena Gardens, (415) 777-5300,
www.whotels.com. A standard room starting at $299 was offered at this
423-room hotel. But that changes, the clerk said, "depending on when
you book and whom you book with."</TE>
<TE>   Westin St. Francis, 335 Powell St. on Union Square, (415)
397-7000, www.westin.com. A rate card also was unavailable at the
1,194-room hotel. The clerk mentioned a range of $189 to $469,
adding, "Rates vary according to occupancy."</TE>

<HD>Shanghai's saga continues to unfold</HD>
<DH>Once notorious as a capital of vice, then as a model of
urban communism, the cosmopolitan city is now reinventing itself as a
roaring economic engine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert J. Myers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Shanghai</DL>
<LD>Gritty and crowded, Shanghai has a vibrant street life and a history
of intrigue, but most of all it has a proven capacity to reinvent
itself -- something I had heard was now happening at a maniacal pace.</LD>
<LD>   The city, home to 15 million, is the heart of China's burgeoning
economic development and has become one of the world's
fastest-changing places as the government heaps millions into the
economy and permanently alters the skyline with a host of new
skyscrapers.</LD>
<LD>   It has been nearly 10 years since my family and I left Shanghai.
When my firm assigned me there in 1988, I regarded the city as a
hardship posting: It had foul air and a byzantine business climate,
and it was under communist rule. But when I left five years later, my
attitude was changing, and so was this city on the Yangtze River
Delta.</LD>
<TE>   What is Shanghai like today? We decided to retrace our steps as
expatriates, discovering the profound changes that, we heard, were
restoring Shanghai as East Asia's preeminent capital of commerce and
culture.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Lynn, teenage daughter, Lindsey, and I arrived at
Shanghai's new Pudong Airport in late August. Our taxi crossed the
Huangpu River, delivering us into the city. On the right was the new
Pudong "special economic zone"; on the left, the Bund, the row of Old
World buildings and banks that remain from Shanghai's heyday.</TE>
<TE>   We were dismayed to see that so much of the old city had been
leveled to make way for skyscrapers. But we remembered what the city
once was and envisioned it unfolding, block by block, one age merging
into the next, as we taxied west and back in time. From the Bund, the
heart of the onetime international settlement, we traversed what
remains of the French Concession; Shanghai's nickname, "Paris of the
Orient," stems from this area's graceful tree-lined avenues and
Gallic style of architecture. Continuing back in time, we entered the
Jing An district with its Ching- and Ming-era temples.</TE>
<TE>   A series of reincarnations</TE>
<TE>   Shanghai, which translates to "above the sea," was an outpost for
the cotton trade until the British won the Opium Wars in 1842,
forcing China open to international commerce. The city, at the
juncture of the Yangtze and the Pacific, became the fulcrum of
business activity in the region. Autonomous foreign settlements were
formed, business flourished and the glamorous assembled. Shanghai
became both the "Paris of the Orient" and a capital of vice.</TE>
<TE>   The city's decline came with the World War II Japanese occupation,
the civil war and Communist takeover in 1949. Shanghai transformed
itself into a communist urban model. And with the death of Mao
Tse-tung and the emergence of the more moderate Deng Xiaoping in the
early 1980s, Shanghai reincarnated again, evolving into a free trade
and tourism powerhouse.</TE>
<TE>   A good night's sleep was on our minds when we arrived at the
glittery Portman Ritz-Carlton Hotel, in the Shanghai Centre complex.
Opened in 1990, the Centre instantly became a symbol of a new and
reemerging Shanghai. It is a 50-story city-within-a-city catering
mainly to the foreign community, developed by Atlanta architect John
Portman. There are two apartment towers, a retail mall, a theater,
the hotel and U.S.-style businesses such as Starbucks and the Hard
Rock Cafe. We lived in an apartment there in the early '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Climbing out of the taxi, we experienced a familiar sensation:
Shanghai's oppressive August humidity. After checking into our small
but elegant room, we dropped into the Long Bar, a favorite expatriate
hangout on the second level of the complex. Still displayed above the
bar were small plaques commemorating some of its first patrons, among
them Reagan-era Cabinet members Caspar W. Weinberger and Alexander M.
Haig Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Our first morning, in 90-degree heat, we walked a few blocks west
on Nanjing Road to the Jing An subway station, opened in 1999. It was
easy to use and even provided helpful signs in Chinese and English,
like "Do not leap into the tunnels." Two stops and 17 cents later, we
exited the Renmin Park station bound for People's Square.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby is the new Urban Planning Exhibition Hall, the perfect
place to become oriented to Shanghai's past, present and future. This
modern building, which resembles an ancient Chinese pavilion about to
take flight, features a pictorial history of Shanghai's architecture
and a Disney-like "main street" with a traditional Chinese pharmacy,
teahouse and other reminders of what Shanghai was like not so long
ago. But the most fascinating feature is a massive scale model of the
city. Studying it, one senses the monumental scale of current
construction.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the Exhibition Hall, we crossed People's Square to the
Great World complex to take another look at Shanghai's more recent
past. In an infamous spasm of debauchery, Great World opened in the
1920s as a sort of one-stop shop for all imaginable vices. It began
innocently enough on the lower floor of the six-story building with
acrobats and magicians. On upper floors were gambling, drugs,
prostitution and ever more exotic pleasures. Great World now reflects
China's egalitarian mores: It has become a slightly cheesy amusement
arcade with carnival games and magic shows. We doubled back to
People's Square and the new Shanghai Museum for a look into ancient
China. I found myself using the word "exquisite" frequently as I
strolled through the four floors of galleries. The museum owns one of
the world's great collections of Chinese art and artifacts. Bronze
vessels in immaculate condition, dating to the 18th century BC, are
beautifully displayed. There are also ceramics, paintings,
porcelains, furniture, costumes and other artifacts from the Tang,
Song, Ming and other dynasties.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner we chose an old favorite, the Jin Jiang Hotel. At its
12th-floor Si Chuan Restaurant, we decided against bullfrog, stewed
snake and "mixed internal organs of beef." Instead we ordered steamed
dumplings (xiao lomba) and tofu with chili sauce (mapu dofu), all
very spicy. We recalled that right across the way, Henry A. Kissinger
and Chou En-lai signed the Shanghai Communique in 1972, establishing
diplomatic relations.</TE>
<TE>   Renovation boom</TE>
<TE>   The following day, several friends hosted lunch at Zhiweiguan, a
Hangzhou-style restaurant in the Jing An district. The lotus stuffed
with glutinous rice was pleasantly sweet, and the "drunken chicken"
was moist and delicious. We reminisced about the old days, when
recreational opportunities were scarce. So our friends flagged taxis,
and, after a few minutes, a splash of colorful banners announced the
new Xintiandi area, a once rundown neighborhood that has gentrified
into a chic entertainment center. Buildings that decayed for decades
have been renovated to house restaurants, nightclubs, galleries and
boutiques.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, our daughter settled in at our hotel room to e-mail
friends while my wife and I caught the subway. At the Bund History
Museum at the north end of Huangpu Park is a brief pictorial history
of the area. There at the confluence of Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu
River, the entire Bund is visible, as is the Pudong New Area across
the river with its garish Pearl of the Orient TV tower, Asia's
tallest structure. Strolling Zhongshan Road on the Bund, we stepped
into the Industrial and Commercial Bank, originally Jardine Matheson
&amp; Co., whose lobby has been restored to its original white marble and
gilt splendor. We moved on to the Hong Kong Shanghai Bank, now the
Pudong Development Bank. High up in the entry dome, layers of paint
were removed to reveal an elaborate mosaic picturing the world's
trading capitals, the zodiac and scenes from Greek mythology, another
reminder of Shanghai's 1920s opulence.</TE>
<TE>   We took a breather from the heat at the famous Peace Hotel, musing
that Noel Coward wrote "Private Lives" here in 1930. Then we returned
to the subway on the way to Pudong, on the other side of the river,
and its Grand Hyatt Hotel, which resembles an 88-story pagoda.
Visitors can pay for passage to the top-floor observation deck. But
we relaxed in the 54th-floor lobby, sipped iced tea and coffee and
looked out on Pudong, the Bund, the river traffic and the murky
afternoon sky.</TE>
<TE>   We wanted to spend some time in our old neighborhood, so we
checked out of the five-star Ritz and into the three-star Donghu
Hotel, in the heart of the Luwan district, formerly called the French
Concession. An apartment in the hotel was our first home in Shanghai.</TE>
<TE>   Though a little musty, our two-room suite was comfortable and
clean, and it cost a third as much as our elegant room at the Ritz.</TE>
<TE>   Most major international performances are now held at the new
1,800-seat Grand Theatre in People's Square, but there is much to see
on other stages too. One night we saw the touring European
Philharmonie at the 1,001-seat Shanghai Centre Theatre; another night
we attended a kung fu exhibition featuring the monks of China's
Shaolin Temple at the spectacularly restored 1930s-era Majestic
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Our final morning, I went jogging along my former four-mile route,
from the Donghu to Huaihai Road. Arriving at Hengshan Road, I passed
a former residence of Chiang Kai-shek, richly renovated into a
popular Continental restaurant, Sasha's.</TE>
<TE>   A little farther on, the Community Church, a charming Tudor
structure, was filled to capacity for the 8 a.m. service. My daughter
was baptized there on Easter in 1989. I was warmly welcomed by a
Chinese usher and asked to join the overflow crowd in the lush
garden, but I jogged on.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the Hengshan Hotel, I heard a Viennese waltz and
investigated a scene fit for a Renoir. Smartly dressed couples
drifted in circles, enjoying the genteel Shanghai exercise ritual of
ballroom dance. As rays of dusty sunlight beamed through the dome of
leaves, I wondered if scenes like this will still exist the next time
I return to Shanghai.</TE>

<HD>Divorce trip can be the first journey toward a new attitude</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PEOPLE sometimes take trips for deep reasons. They're turning 50 and
feel compelled to see Florence; they've just recovered from an
illness and want to trek in the Himalayas; they're divorcing and need
to escape the anguish.</LD>
<LD>   Psychologically motivated trips like these are, in a sense,
gambles with life. The transition or crisis makes people more willing
to free themselves from routine, feel in a heightened way or make
life changes based on events on the road. They are my favorite kinds
of trips.</LD>
<LD>   I took one a decade ago, and it changed me. I was in the middle of
an ugly divorce, and my life was changing, but into what, I did not
know.</LD>
<TE>   I couldn't find the threshold and didn't want to walk through the
door. Then my parents offered to send me anywhere I wanted to go. I
was jobless, childless, husbandless and couldn't think of a reason to
say no, so I took a divorce trip, the polar opposite of a honeymoon.</TE>
<TE>   I've heard of women who have gone to swinging singles resorts in
the Caribbean after a divorce. One, a beleaguered single mom, came
home from such a place on Haiti, having danced every night until dawn
with several men who seemed interested in her. She did not get
involved but felt more attractive to the opposite sex afterward, no
small gift.</TE>
<TE>   "Travel can help you get away from the scene of pain," says
Harriet Lerner, a psychotherapist and author of "The Dance of
Connection" (Quill, 2002). "This is especially important because it's
normal to have crashing self-esteem after a divorce."</TE>
<TE>   A friend of a friend went to a Caribbean island in the throes of
divorce and slept with a Frenchman she met on the beach. On the plane
home, she wondered what in the world she had been thinking, given the
dangers of sexually transmitted disease.</TE>
<TE>   Marilyn Mason, a Santa Fe, N.M., psychologist and author of "Seven
Mountains: Life Lessons From a Climber's Journal" (Penguin Putnam,
1997), says it's dangerous for disenchanted lovers to travel because
they might meet someone who looks better than the spouse back home,
thereby precipitating divorce. West L.A. psychotherapist Marion
Solomon, author of "Narcissism and Intimacy: Love and Marriage in an
Age of Confusion" (W.W. Norton, 1989), says people who feel
devastated by divorce should not travel to find someone new. "They
have to be careful," she says. "If they think whoever they meet is
going to be a lifelong partner, they might be disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   Still, travel seems to me as good a prescription for divorce and
other traumatic life passages as antidepressants. In the aftermath of
a divorce -- and before AIDS made people wary about sleeping with
strangers -- a friend who had just separated from her husband
traveled from India to the Mediterranean, where she spent a week on
the beach with a man she met on the tour. The two then went their
separate ways without looking back.</TE>
<TE>   Sex isn't mandatory on a divorce trip; other things can be at
least as fulfilling. Dunham Gooding, director of the American Alpine
Institute in Bellingham, Wash., which sponsors two-week climbs of
peaks in Asia, Alaska and South America, doesn't know precisely what
motivates participants.</TE>
<TE>   But he says they are rewarded in ways that could benefit anyone
going through the uncertainty and turmoil of an important life
passage.</TE>
<TE>   "Entering a landscape as challenging as the mountains is
completely absorbing," Gooding says. "People's decisions matter and
have immediately measurable results." Moreover, there's the
"psychological refreshment of going into a grandly beautiful place,"
as Gooding puts it.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the same benefits accrue from travel of any kind. For me
it was a simple trip to Europe, on my own for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   I flew to France and visited my best friend, who had a house in
the foothills of the Pyrenees, then took a train to Italy's Cinque
Terre, where I walked an olive grove-lined path above the Ligurian
Sea, a time of deep quiet and healing solitude.</TE>
<TE>   My divorce trip ended in Rome. It was my first visit there, and I
clearly remember going out walking shortly after I arrived. Suddenly
I saw the Colosseum and dissolved in tears. I don't know whether I
was weeping for the gladiators who died there or for myself.</TE>
<TE>   The whole week in Rome was like that. Grief over the end of my
marriage heightened my reactions, turning visits to the Vatican or
the Piazza Navona into emotional pilgrimages. I bonded deeply with
the Eternal City and still think of it as the right place to go when
life falls apart. For me, Rome was a door to a new life, though it
took some time for me to realize I had passed through it.</TE>
<TE>   Now, when someone I care about is in a time of trouble, I tell him
or her to travel, but not just for sightseeing, pleasure and escape.
Traveling at such times is a rare opportunity to find the road ahead.</TE>

<LD>   Winter specials mean thrifty packages to Rome and Florence</LD>
<LD>   TOSS three coins in the Trevi Fountain in Rome, then hop a train
to Florence and stand before Michelangelo's "David" in the Galleria
dell'Accademia.</LD>
<TE>   All for just a bit more than $100 a day, including round-trip air
fare from LAX on Lufthansa, first-class hotels, daily buffet
breakfasts, a first-class express train ticket from Rome to Florence,
taxes, service charges and a couple of bottles of wine.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-day, $859 package is being sold by TourCrafters, an
Illinois-based company that specializes in travel to Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "There are winter specials every year, but they're not as
inexpensive as this one," said TourCrafters representative Barbara
Gilliam. "It's because Lufthansa is in the picture this year. Their
air fares are really low; they need the business."</TE>
<TE>   The seven-night package, which must include a Saturday night stay,
is available through Dec. 14, and from Jan. 6 to Jan. 31.</TE>
<TE>   Four nights are spent in Rome. Hotels included in the package are
in the historic city center, including the Hotel Gallia near Santa
Maria Maggiore; Hotel Genio, near Piazza Navona; and Hotel Pace

Florence at the Hotel Carolus, on the edge of the historic city
center.</TE>

departure. All prices are per person, double occupancy.</TE>

<TE>   If a siesta isn't to your liking, stroll along a deserted beach,
snorkel in the turquoise waters of Blue Lagoon or order a romantic
picnic of lobster and champagne.</TE>
<TE>   But keep your wallet handy. The tariff is $1,090 per night, double
occupancy, with a six-night minimum. And it doesn't include air fare
from LAX to Fiji. But if you stay a seventh night, you'll get air
fare free.</TE>
<TE>   Turtle Island is a 500-acre luxury playground that hosts only 14
couples at a time. Visitors stay in beachfront Fijian bures, two-room
thatched cottages with 21-foot vaulted ceilings, a king-size
four-poster bed and a private veranda with views of the surrounding
lagoon.</TE>
<TE>   Meals, beverages and activities are included in the price. The
seaplane trip to Turtle Island from Nadi, Fiji, where international
flights land and depart, is an additional $760 per couple.</TE>

sheep, mule deer and more than 200 varieties of birds.</TE>

camping along the river and is designed for novices, said organizer
Ken McKeon. "By day we explore a calm, flat-water section of the
river; by night we relax by a campfire under a blanket of stars."</TE>
<TE>   The group leaves San Diego Friday morning and camps along the
river two nights, returning to San Diego late Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: $269 per person, double occupancy, including round-trip
transportation from San Diego to the Colorado River, six meals,
including a Thanksgiving camp meal on Friday, all kayaking and
camping equipment except a sleeping bag, and introductory kayaking
instruction.</TE>

<HD>The Enigma Behind the Man on the $100 Bill</HD>
<DH>The 'Ben Franklin' documentary was born during the making
of a series on the American Revolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Benjamin Franklin was one of the country's Founding Fathers. He
discovered the lightning rod, invented bifocals and charted the Gulf
Stream. He wrote the witty and wise "Poor Richard's Almanac," which
is still read today. And his worldly countenance graces the $100
bill.</LD>
<LD>   But despite his significant place in American history, Franklin
remains somewhat of an enigma.</LD>
<LD>   "There is this American myth that he is this fat old avuncular guy
you can put your arms around," says Ronald Blumer, writer and
co-producer of the new three-part PBS documentary, "Benjamin
Franklin," which premieres Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   "Boy, did we find out differently. One scholar said it was
impossible to ever figure out who Franklin was because he was so
modern in terms of putting forth the image he wanted to create. The
only time we ever thought we were getting at the truth of Franklin is
when he got angry and he would really show his true mettle.
Otherwise, he puts on his bland 'I'm Mr. Nice Guy.' It was an act."</TE>
<TE>   The creative team that produced the Peabody Award-wining PBS
documentary series "Liberty!: The American Revolution" was
responsible for "Benjamin Franklin," which, like "Liberty!," utilizes
paintings, interviews with scholars and actors playing the various
historical figures discussed in the documentary. Dylan Baker and Tony
Award-winning actor Richard Easton both portray Franklin, with Blair
Brown playing his sister Jane, Peter Donaldson as John Adams and
Robert Maxwell his wife, Deborah.</TE>
<TE>   "Benjamin Franklin" was a direct outgrowth of "Liberty!,"
according to executive producer Catherine Allan. "In the middle of
the editing room for 'Liberty!,' the narration came by that Benjamin
Franklin was the most famous American in the world [during his
lifetime]. I said, 'Stop. How could that be?' And then the writer
just turned to me and said, 'Well, he was.' His discovery in
electricity had made him a world-famous celebrity. That immediately
piqued my interest, and then realizing he had led an entire life
before the American Revolution.... "</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was brilliant -- a classic over-achiever whose mind was
always going a mile a minute.</TE>
<TE>   '"We think there is one kind of intelligence, which is measured by
IQ tests," Blumer says. "But in fact we know now there are lots of
kinds of intelligence -- social intelligence, political intelligence,
financial intelligence. Franklin had all the intelligences people can
have and he used it and exploited it. That's what's so amazing. He
wasn't just a geek. He could organize people. He could get along with
people and he could manipulate people."</TE>
<TE>   He was also very hard on his family. He left Deborah in
Philadelphia when he went on a diplomatic mission to England. Though
he said he'd return soon, he stayed for 15 years. Deborah died before
his return.</TE>
<TE>   He disowned his son William, who was governor of New Jersey,
because he sided with England during the American Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   "He was wonderful with strangers or acquaintances," Easton says.
"I think it has to do with being a loner.... "</TE>
<TE>   "He would be a great dinner guest," Blumer says. "He wasn't a big
talker, but he was very self-effacing. He would listen more than
talk, but whenever he opened up his mouth, whatever he said was
fascinating. He has become a really boring guy, a patron saint of all
the Rotary clubs and savings banks, and that is so far from the
truth."</TE>

<HD>Singapore Muslims Invoke a Remnant of Surgical Tradition</HD>
<DH>Female circumcision persists, but in a mild form. One
mother says it's 'like having your ears pierced.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gillian Wee</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>Ratna Damayanti considers herself a modern Muslim. Like many of her
peers in this wealthy island nation, she counts coffee shops and jazz
bars among her favorite haunts and watches "Friends" every week.</LD>
<LD>   Damayanti also thinks of herself as more modern than her more
conservative Muslim girlfriends who wear the Islamic headscarf. But
the extroverted college student does have one thing in common with
them.</LD>
<LD>   They were all circumcised when they were a few days old. And she
says that if she ever has daughters, she will have no qualms about
putting them through the same procedure.</LD>
<TE>   "I would allow my children to go through it," she says. "It's not
like they are removing everything."</TE>
<TE>   In Singapore's small Muslim community, female circumcision
involves nicking the prepuce, the skin covering the clitoris.</TE>
<TE>   It is markedly different from the practices of some Muslim
communities in Africa and the Middle East that are decried by human
rights activists as female genital mutilation. In some cases, a young
girl's clitoris is clipped and burned. In a few communities, all the
external genitalia are cut off and the remnant tissue is sewn up to
leave only a small opening.</TE>
<TE>   Those practices originated 1,400 years ago, before the birth of
Islam's Prophet Muhammad, said Noor Aisha Binte Abdul Rahman, a Malay
studies professor at the National University of Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore's milder form is viewed as symbolic of this tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But the custom has no religious basis and no guidelines -- except
that it should not bring harm to believers, said Zhulkeflee Haji
Ismail, manager of Singapore's Islamic Scholars and Religious
Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people just follow customs without knowing what they're
about," the scholar said. "Traditions die hard."</TE>
<TE>   Yaacob Ibrahim, the government minister in charge of Muslim
affairs in this city-state, said he does not plan to circumcise his
daughter since it is not a religiously required practice.</TE>
<TE>   He said there are no laws regulating the practice in Singapore,
whose predominantly Chinese population of 4 million includes 300,000
Muslims, most of them ethnic Malays.</TE>
<TE>   Circumcisions in Singapore are done by female doctors at a handful
of Muslim clinics. It's another contrast to areas that practice the
harsher forms of circumcision, which are often done by nonmedical
practitioners in unsanitary conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Masayu Zainab Masagos Mohamed, who circumcises five to six
patients a day at a Singapore clinic, said the procedure is usually
performed on babies or prepubescent children. But it has been done on
women of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure involves using small, stainless steel scissors to
make a "nick" of a half-inch or less on the skin covering the
clitoris, Zainab said.</TE>
<TE>   No anesthesia is used because the injection would be more painful
than the cut itself, she said, and she prescribes an antibiotic cream
for the punctured skin. The procedure costs about $17 and is not
covered by insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Zainab, who wears a headscarf, said there is no specific medical
rationale for the practice, although many Muslim women think there
is. In the past, Singapore females were circumcised at home by
traditional Malay midwives, Zainab said.</TE>
<TE>   Not all Singaporean Muslims embrace the practice. Some, like
27-year-old housewife Nur Naadiya Chia, said it is "outdated and
inhumane."</TE>
<TE>   But most Muslim women go along with the practice. They say it does
not affect their sexuality nor cause them any discomfort.</TE>
<TE>   "The procedure is like having your ears pierced," said Zaileen
Mohammed Zain Tahar, a mother of two sons and a daughter. "It's
nothing."</TE>

<HD>Mothers of India Cry for Joy to Learn It's a Boy</HD>
<DH>Sons are so prized that even well-educated women feel
pressure to bear them. Prenatal testing, abortion and infanticide
skew the ratio of males to females.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Sullivan</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>The sign stands outside a doctor's office in a leafy New Delhi
neighborhood, a hand-painted warning that the law is upheld in this
enclave of walled-off homes, imported cars and private clubs.</LD>
<LD>   "Here prenatal sex determination [boy or girl before birth] is not
done. It is a punishable act," the sign says in both English and
Hindi.</LD>
<LD>   The law, though, clearly has its loopholes.</LD>
<TE>   "The Indian mentality is like this: You have to have a son," said
one New Delhi woman from a wealthy industrial family.</TE>
<TE>   After she gave birth to a daughter, her husband's family demanded
that she have illegal sex-determination tests. When each of her next
three pregnancies tested female, they demanded that she have
abortions. In a nation where a woman's in-laws often wield enormous
influence, she complied.</TE>
<TE>   "They say I have to try and try" for a son, said the woman, who
spoke on condition that she not be identified. "My mother-in-law --
full pressure; my father-in-law -- full pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Across much of India, sons have long been preferred. They have
more status, they don't require expensive wedding dowries, they can
light their parents' funeral pyres. A married woman traditionally
moves in with her husband's family.</TE>
<TE>   "Raising a girl," an Indian adage says, "is like watering the
neighbor's garden."</TE>
<TE>   The preference for sons has led to such practices as killing
female infants -- illegal for well over a century but still practiced
in some parts of this nation of 1.05 billion people. And with the
advent of sex-determination tests has come the aborting of female
fetuses.</TE>
<TE>   Activists and officials long believed that such practices were
largely an issue among the poor and less educated, and would
gradually be choked off by education, legislation and the spread of
India's middle class.</TE>
<TE>   But as that educated middle class has blossomed over the last two
decades, and laws protecting girls have been strengthened, the
numbers have grown worse.</TE>
<TE>   And among the worst of all areas are those wealthy enclaves.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we'd create awareness through education," said Dr.
Sharda Jain, a gynecologist with a well-heeled New Delhi clientele
and a fierce opposition to sex-determination tests. "But what happens
when the educated want to terminate their girl children?"</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, faced with the spread of inexpensive ultrasound
technology and a parallel slide in the girl-boy ratio, India outlawed
prenatal sex-determination tests.</TE>
<TE>   At best, the effect has been minimal. In the 2001 census' count of
children 6 or under, there were 927 girls for every 1,000 boys-- down
from 945 girls in 1991 and 962 in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics mean there are anywhere from 20 million to 40
million "missing" women in India -- the result of girls aborted or
killed in infancy, according to census reports and activists.</TE>
<TE>   The preference for boys, strong across most of Asia, has also led
to a scarcity of women elsewhere, particularly in China, where the
official one-child policy has dramatically magnified the pressure for
male children and spawned trafficking in kidnapped women for brides.</TE>
<TE>   In India's larger families, if the first-born is a daughter, she
will normally be accepted. But the pressure for boys can build
fiercely after that.</TE>
<TE>   India's 2001 census found the widening of the sex ratio was
sharpest in India's most economically developed states. In New Delhi,
the capital, the ratio dropped from 945 girls per 1,000 boys in 1991
to 865 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Near the bottom were some of the city's toniest neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a belief that urbanization and prosperity will
somehow have a modernizing effect," said Satish Agnihotri, a Calcutta
University professor who studies the demographics of what he and
others call "feticide." The reality, though, is the opposite: "As
prosperity goes up, the sex ratio seems to go down."</TE>
<TE>   It is another example of the dichotomy that is modern India.
Fifty-five years after independence from Britain, India has the
world's largest middle class, estimated at 300 million people -- but
nearly 250 million malnourished people.</TE>
<TE>   It is a country with one of the world's leading software centers,
the city of Bangalore -- but where 110 million homes have no toilets.
It is a nation that decades ago elected a female prime minister,
Indira Gandhi -- and where some women hold top posts in academia,
business and government -- but where most women are still relegated
to lives of quiet household desperation.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for the dismal gender statistics range from the
economic to the cultural: pressure for small families, dowry demands
that can run into thousands of dollars and, perhaps most important, a
steep drop in the cost of ultrasound tests. Unlike prenatal
amniocentesis exams, which can cost hundreds of dollars, a
sex-determination ultrasound can cost less than $10, an abortion just
$18.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot for India's poor, although still manageable for most.
For the wealthy, it's less than a good restaurant dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say the issue is not abortion, which is widely accepted
in India, but how women are valued. That's something that many women
struggle with themselves.</TE>
<TE>   A well-off woman in her late 20s, a college graduate in the social
sciences, described growing increasingly depressed during her second
pregnancy. Already the mother of a daughter, she desperately wanted a
son.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just my own pressure that I was missing something in my
life," said the woman who, torn by her feelings, didn't seek an
illegal ultrasound. "I was in a big trauma because even if it is a
girl, then what am I going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   Her gynecologist, worried that the woman's fear would affect her
health, finally told her that she was carrying a boy.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me cry so much," the woman said, relief and pride echoing
in her voice. "My life got fulfilled."</TE>
<TE>   Some activists, though, say the problem is as much legal as
cultural. They blast the government for barely enforcing the
6-year-old law -- the Supreme Court had to order enforcement in 2001,
and then in response to lawsuits. There have apparently been few
prosecutions of doctors or ultrasound technicians.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people talking about it now, but that is not enough,"
said Sabu George, a co-petitioner in the Supreme Court lawsuit. "In
many parts of the country, there is no implementation" of the law.</TE>
<TE>   George puts much of the blame on the medical profession, saying
greed drives the availability of illegal services.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say that's nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   While the staff in Jain's clinic regularly perform ultrasounds and
abortions, they don't do sex-determination tests -- or abortions if
they believe that the woman had a sex test elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But for many doctors, that refusal is a struggle. Many have long
relationships with their patients and know that if they won't break
the law, other doctors will.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just one woman, it's hundreds" who ask for the tests,
said a New Delhi gynecologist who refuses to perform
sex-determinations, but knows that many of her patients get them
elsewhere. "We are close to them. That is why we don't give them to
the police."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, plans to battle the gender deficit have included
threats of jail time for lawbreaking doctors, preachy movies and
condemnations by religious leaders. New rules say clinics performing
ultrasounds must post signs warning that they don't do sex tests,
although few appear to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Little has worked.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, many activists still believe that the answer lies in
education and economics -- and that a shift is coming.</TE>
<TE>   "Things will definitely change," said Jain, who believes that as
more educated women become financially independent, their value and
decision-making power will increase.</TE>
<TE>   For some, the change has already come.</TE>
<TE>   The woman pressured by her in-laws into repeated abortions is
pregnant again. Now, though, her resolve has strengthened.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether it's a boy or girl I don't care," she said. "I want a
baby .... I want a second child whatever it is."</TE>
<TE>   This time she's had no sex test. And she insists that she won't.</TE>

<HD>Holland Riven by the Politics of Division</HD>
<DH>Once known for tolerance, the Dutch now face racial
tensions. Immigration, crime and welfare are flash points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anthony Deutsch</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Holland likes to think of itself as a placid country of hard-working
merchants and salt-of-the-earth farmers, where tolerance, prosperity
and social conscience go hand-in-hand.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Dutch are agonizing over values that they once took for
granted and a system that no longer seems to work.</LD>
<LD>   Six months after the assassination of populist politician Pim
Fortuyn, followed by his stunning posthumous election success, his
movement is collapsing as swiftly as it rose, leaving some people
frustrated and wondering where else to turn.</LD>
<TE>   The changes go beyond politics and into self-image as the Dutch
find themselves at the crest of some of Europe's most trying dilemmas
-- immigration, crime and overburdened welfare systems.</TE>
<TE>   In a country that has been a pioneer of legal marijuana, same-sex
marriages and euthanasia, and where brothels are taxpaying
businesses, old-fashioned themes of family values are being sounded
more frequently these days.</TE>
<TE>   Many Dutchmen are glad that in the last year, politics has come
out of the backrooms into the streets. But some worry that it has
changed Dutch norms of respect and decency.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of aggression and violence in our society that
nobody wanted to know about because we wanted to uphold the image
that we were tolerant," social historian Thera Wijsenbeek said. "It
has created instability and stirred up emotions. The brakes seem to
have been taken off society."</TE>
<TE>   So many cocaine smugglers have been caught recently that there
aren't enough jail cells to hold them. People wait so long for
surgery that many go next door to Belgium. Road traffic is snarled
into an almost permanent rush hour, while bus and train fares are
going up 10% next year.</TE>
<TE>   When immigrants were needed to overcome a labor shortage, they
were welcomed with open arms. No longer.</TE>
<TE>   High taxes were imposed to fund a generous welfare system. Now
every fifth worker is on long-term sick leave and the welfare system
is buckling.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with some jarring industrial European cities, the Dutch
still have a lifestyle that harks back to a calmer age. Many bicycle
to work, past old gabled houses along ancient canals, and windmills
still turn lazily in the mirror-flat countryside.</TE>
<TE>   But a country proud of its sympathy for the developing world now
confronts racial tensions that were routinely swept under the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters three generations removed from their Turkish and
Moroccan immigrant ancestors, speaking fluent Dutch and holding Dutch
citizenship, complain of discrimination and are blamed by the
self-styled "native Dutch" for rising crime.</TE>
<TE>   Although non-Western immigrants and their descendants are only 10%
of the population of 16 million, they make up about half the
population of the main cities.</TE>
<TE>   When Rob Oudkerk, an Amsterdam city councilor, was caught on
camera talking about "rotten Moroccans" (he later apologized), a
Moroccan-born Dutch rapper named Raymzter seized on the phrase for an
MTV rap song. Wearing a turned-around baseball cap, he hammered out
his lyrics in earthy street Dutch:</TE>
<TE>   They look at me like I flew into the Twin Towers,</TE>
<TE>   They want to put us down when they talk about us,</TE>
<TE>   We didn't do a thing, but they want to hate us.</TE>
<TE>   The May election campaign broke all taboos thanks to Fortuyn, a
gay magazine columnist who flaunted his political incorrectness by
ridiculing Islam as backward and demanding an end to immigration.</TE>
<TE>   He also challenged other cornerstone values of post-World War II
Dutch society, such as the welfare state and workers' rights, saying
they were bloated beyond reason.</TE>
<TE>   The outgoing Social Democratic government had already begun to
change the system.</TE>
<TE>   Social benefits were sharply scaled back. Student grants were
linked to performance. Welfare entitlements were tightened and
thousands of people were cut off.</TE>
<TE>   Fortuyn was shot by an animal rights campaigner nine days before
the election in Holland's first political murder in 400 years, but
his party went on to win more than 1.6 million votes out of 11
million cast, and join a center-right coalition government.</TE>
<TE>   But without the charismatic Fortuyn, whose alleged killer is
awaiting trial, the party dissolved into bickering and on Oct. 16 the
government resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Building on restrictions the previous government had begun to
introduce, the new coalition set up an Immigration Ministry and
appointed Hilbrand Nawijn, Fortuyn's designated successor as party
leader, to run it. He proposed locking immigrant families in
"departure centers" while their asylum requests are processed,
promised to double the number of deportations and set a target
rejection rate of 80% for newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   But the government collapsed after only 87 days, leaving the Dutch
with the feeling that the immigration question is nowhere near a
solution.</TE>
<TE>   Elections for a new parliament are scheduled for Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   The Netherlands, the size of West Virginia but nine times more
populous, is the most densely packed country in Europe. The Dutch
were building dikes and landfills 1,000 years ago. So, to many,
immigration makes the feeling of crowding seem more acute.</TE>
<TE>   Old Dutch fixtures such as churches and cheese markets are making
way for mosques and stands offering Moroccan spices or whole lambs
slaughtered under Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   Herman Heinsbroek, a Fortuyn follower and economics minister in
the outgoing government, says his countrymen must do more to absorb
immigrants into the Dutch way of life: "Teach your neighbor how it
works here, speak Dutch, explain the ground rules of society."</TE>
<TE>   Heinsbroek says he plans to run in the January elections on a
platform of "old-fashioned" standards and values such as tougher
policing and respect for teachers and elders.</TE>

<HD>Blithely Biking the Road of Death</HD>
<DH>High in Bolivian Andes, vehicles regularly plunge off
cliffs. Still the tourists come.</DH>

<DL>LA PAZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>Onlookers inched to the edge of the road and peered 600 feet down
into the misty jungle where a shattered bus and its victims lay.</LD>
<LD>   Someone flung down a rope. About 50 men pulled and then fell
silent when the corpse of an Indian woman rose through the clouds,
her clothes bloodied and torn. They stared as rescuers laid her on
the muddy ground with a tropical fern over her face.</LD>
<LD>   Then came a strange click-clacking sound. Swooping down the road
came a group of tourists in bright red cycling suits, riding modern
mountain bikes and offering an incongruous sight on "El Camino de la
Muerte" -- the Highway of Death.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice, and it's really dangerous," said Esther Marechal, a
28-year-old tourist from the Netherlands. She and four other Dutch
cyclists weaved through trucks backed up on the 10-foot-wide road,
then squeezed past the accident scene and disappeared around a sharp
curve, arms joggling with every bump.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, 101 Bolivians have died in traffic accidents
along the 40-mile road carved into a mountainside that drops 11,700
feet, or 2.2 miles, from snowcapped Andes to steaming jungle.</TE>
<TE>   Yet what is a deathtrap for Bolivians has become one of this
nation's hottest tourist attractions for adventurous and athletic
bicyclists.</TE>
<TE>   Guidebooks bill the single-lane dirt road as the world's most
dangerous highway.</TE>
<TE>   "Those up for an adrenaline rush will be in their element, but if
you're unnerved by a gravel track just 3.2 meters wide -- just enough
for one vehicle -- sheer 1,000-meter drop-offs, hulking rock
overhangs and waterfalls that spill across and erode the highway,
your best bet is to bury your head and not look until it's over,"
says the Lonely Planet guide.</TE>
<TE>   Travel agencies in La Paz, 40 miles to the southwest, transport
cyclists to the top of the road and then accompany them with a guide
the entire way down.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a thrill, especially for young boys looking for bragging
rights," said Karin Gembus of Gravity Assisted Mountain Biking, which
charges $49 a person for a guided tour.</TE>
<TE>   "It's dangerous because there are buses falling off the road, not
because there are buses hitting cyclists," Gembus told one
prospective client. "You've got some incredible views."</TE>
<TE>   Moss-covered crosses dot the shoulder where people have
disappeared over 1,000-foot precipices. At the top of the road a
monument memorializes two young Dutch lovers killed in a fall.
Farther down, a memorial marks where some political dissidents were
pushed over the edge on orders of a military government.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers with red and green flags emerge from the mist to regulate
truck traffic in an effort to prevent collisions.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the road's most dangerous sections have nicknames. The
curve where the bus accident happened is called "Central Sacrament."</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers pulled 31 dead from the jungle floor after the
crash Sept. 2. Julio Paco, 30, one of 16 people who survived, woke to
screams around 5 a.m., and realized the bus was leaning over the
muddy edge.</TE>
<TE>   The bus, which was traveling uphill from Coroico to La Paz, fell
600 feet down the mountainside, or about 50 stories. After regaining
consciousness, Paco managed to climb up to the road, despite a torn
scalp.</TE>
<TE>   Paco told his story from a hospital room he shared with another
survivor, Fortunato Guarachi, 36, who lost his brother in the crash.
Guarachi broke his collar bone but also was able to climb back up to
the road.</TE>
<TE>   The government is building a safer highway. It was supposed to be
finished two years ago, but officials say tunneling difficulties have
set back the schedule. They now aim for completion by April.</TE>

<HD>London Unleashes Air Raids to Banish Bothersome Pigeons</HD>
<DH>Hawks are enlisted to chase away the populous pests,
despite objections from animal-rights activists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Wardell</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Early on a crisp morning, while most of the capital sleeps, an elite
fighting force rids the city of vermin.</LD>
<LD>   Buzz, a 2-year-old Harris hawk, flies high above Westminster
Abbey, the Houses of Parliament and other landmarks on the lookout
for one of the greatest scourges of modern London -- pigeons.</LD>
<LD>   Buzz and his handler, Roger Polley, rise before 4 a.m. three days
a week to climb to the top of the Treasury building, where Buzz is
set free. His circling presence is enough to scare off recalcitrant
pigeons.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like having a tiger in your front room. You're not going to
hang around to see if it can catch you, and you are not going back in
to see if it's still there," Polley said.</TE>
<TE>   Falconry -- the hunting of wild quarry using trained birds of prey
-- has been a sport in Europe for centuries, but only in recent years
have canny falconers thought of turning their hobby into a business.</TE>
<TE>   City officials say millions of pigeons in London are
disease-ridden and have no respect for statues and historic
buildings, leaving a collective calling card that costs thousands of
dollars to remove.</TE>
<TE>   Their growing numbers led City Hall to revoke the license of the
last pigeon-feed seller in Trafalgar Square last year, ending a
decades-old tourist tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Polley's boss, David Van Vynck, said his family falconry fell into
the pest control business while displaying birds at a country fair
about 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "A local baker saw us with the birds and asked us if we could
scare away sparrows from its bakery. We were the only ones doing it
at first," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Although falconry is a sport that has been around since medieval
times, the actual use of birds in this way to deter nuisance species
is a modern-age phenomenon."</TE>
<TE>   Several falconries are now competing for business in London.
Yearly contracts to keep dozens of sites around the capital
pigeon-free -- such as Downing Street, where the prime minister lives
-- are worth up to $65,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Some animal rights activists complain that the hawks often kill
their prey rather than simply scare them away.</TE>
<TE>   But van Vynck said a predatory bird couldn't kill more than a bird
a day. Instead, he said, their task is to "change the patterns of the
pigeons who are creatures of habit. The Harris hawk is an excellent
tool for removing pigeons from areas that we couldn't otherwise get
to."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Lewis, facilities manager for the newly refurbished
Treasury building, said the government had enlisted the falconers
because they wanted a humane solution.</TE>
<TE>   "The alternatives are shooting them or poisoning them, neither of
which are acceptable these days," Lewis said. Falcons are "the
natural way of doing things."</TE>
<TE>   The van Vynck falconry has 20 Harris hawks and 20 other falcons
used for traditional hunting and display shows.</TE>
<TE>   The hawks, worth $450 to $600 each, are taken to various sites
around London, including train stations and parks</TE>
<TE>   The falconry's seven handlers develop a close relationship with
the birds. Polley named his hawk after its habit of zooming in from
behind and knocking his handler on the head, or "buzzing" him, when
coming in to land on his arm. Thankfully, Buzz has grown out of the
habit.</TE>
<TE>   For Polley, a former factory worker who became a trained hawker
two years ago, his job -- even with its early hours -- is one of the
best in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this view," he said, gazing at the sun rising behind the
Houses of Parliament. "Not everybody gets that for their office."</TE>

<HD>Chinese Play a Global Name Game</HD>
<DH>Striving for something unique and meaningful, young people
adopt such monikers as Vanilla, Thunder, Bryan and Scallion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ted Anthony</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>First she tried "Linda" on for size, but gave it up because her boss
also was named Linda. Then she turned to "Vivienne," for Julia
Roberts' character in "Pretty Woman." Soon, though, various Vivians
and Viviennes were crossing her path.</LD>
<LD>   So when Wang Wei, a marketer in a Beijing hotel, chose her third
English name, she wanted to make absolutely certain that it was
unique. She found it while shopping in the frozen foods aisle of a
supermarket and is still answering to it seven years later.</LD>
<LD>   "In China," Vanilla Wang says today, "it really helps to have a
name people remember."</LD>
<TE>   China talks of opening to the world, of how the most populous
nation is becoming international in epic ways. But it unfolds on
smaller canvases too: Just look at the English names of the younger
generation -- names they have chosen meticulously to present
themselves to the world beyond China.</TE>
<TE>   They find inspiration in foods (Scallion Liang, a student), in
Italian soccer players (Baggio Hua, a mover), in names that evoke
centuries past (Ignatius Ding, a government employee) and names that
just plain sound cosmopolitan (Harlem Zhao, a waitress, and Echo
Wang, an account executive).</TE>
<TE>   It's globalization, on the most personal of levels.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreigners, when they choose Chinese names, go by phonetics. But
Chinese prefer something with meaning," said Wang Xuejun, author of
the popular volume "Choose English Names."</TE>
<TE>   "More Chinese are leaving China. More Chinese are coming into
contact with foreigners in China," he said. "And English is the
world's language. So a beautiful or unique English name gives you
access to all the countries of the world."</TE>
<TE>   It also gives young Chinese the opportunity to craft a logo of
sorts, something that gives them personality in a sometimes
impersonal society -- and that they can find by plundering
fashionable Western popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   And plunder they do.</TE>
<TE>   There is Zhao Tianqi, an artist whose wood-block prints -- a cross
between socialist realism and Andy Warhol -- were selling well to
foreigners. She decided that she needed an appropriate moniker, so
Colour Zhao, complete with British spelling, was born.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't it fit just right?" she boasted.</TE>
<TE>   There is Li Yang, who works for the government in the southern
city of Zhuhai. "I was listening to Bryan Adams and 'Everything I
Do....' So I thought, 'Why not Bryan?' " he recalled. "So it's Bryan
with a 'Y.' "</TE>
<TE>   There is Wang Lei, a 24-year-old video editor who translated his
birth name and now roams Beijing as Thunder Wang.</TE>
<TE>   And Cheng Ming, who works for the foreign affairs office in the
port city of Xiamen, chose "Light" simply because it's a translation
of "Ming." He uses both -- depending on the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "On the mainland, it's like a different face. 'James' in the
office is different than 'Chen Jun' at home. That English name may
represent a side of them that eats at McDonald's and listens to
George Michael and works with Westerners," said Steven Schwankert, an
Internet analyst who focuses on China.</TE>
<TE>   He once taught an English class that included Scallion Liang. "I
said, 'Why would you name yourself after a green onion?' She said, 'I
really wanted to name myself Scarlett, as in O'Hara, but I'm not
glamorous enough to be a Scarlett. So instead I looked for a word
that sounded like it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Chinese place much greater stock in the meaning of names than most
native English speakers. In China, many foreign words are assimilated
into Chinese with great care. America is "meiguo," or "beautiful
country"; Elvis is "maowang", or "King Cat."</TE>
<TE>   So it goes with native Chinese-given names too. During the 1950s
and 1960s, the nationalistic fervor whipped up by Mao Zedong produced
children with given names like "Jianguo," "Jiefang" and "Aijun" --
"build the nation," "liberation" and "love the army."</TE>
<TE>   In mainland China, the first syllable is the family name and the
second two (or sometimes only one) are the given name, which is
rarely used by itself (few would have dared address Chairman Mao as
"Zedong").</TE>
<TE>   Chinese have taken Western first names for generations, whether
because of conversion to Christianity, colonization or emigration.
Some who used English names have gone back to their birth names to
reclaim a sense of Chineseness; the Harry Lee who attended Cambridge
University, for instance, is better known today as Lee Kuan Yew,
Singapore's elder statesman.</TE>
<TE>   In Hong Kong, a British colony for 150 years until 1997, English
first names were understandably popular, and many chose theirs to
evoke the United Kingdom -- producing sundry Desmond Leungs, Agatha
Maks and Winnie Tses. But the latest generation on the mainland,
courting internationalism, has been much more freewheeling.</TE>
<TE>   "I just looked through the dictionary and there it was. I wanted
something unique -- not an average name," says Aegean Zhang, who
tends bar at Henry J. Bean's, an American-style restaurant in
Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting academics have reported students who have claimed Western
brands, calling themselves Kodak, Levi, even Marlboro. Wang, author
of the names book, insists that he has met a Stallone and a Ronald
Reagan Lei. His advice: Stick with something you know, like a
celebrity ("If you enjoy watching 007, just call yourself James").</TE>
<TE>   His book lists thousands of names for the taking, in categories
including American soap operas (Lujack and Stavros), Shakespeare
(Benvolio and Fleance) and "unusual" (Zorb and Quonset, Aisling and
Marisol, Gritt and Taz).</TE>
<TE>   Hogan Sun, president of a 2,000-student language school called
Modern English, got his name from a teacher who loved "Hogan's
Heroes" on TV and says a woman named Potato recently studied in his
program. He attributes the popularity to the growing number of young
urban Chinese working for foreign companies.</TE>
<TE>   "Foreign bosses, they don't have time to remember all these
Chinese names," Sun said. "If you have a name the boss can remember,
you have more of a chance for the boss to choose you for a certain
kind of work -- and then maybe get promoted."</TE>
<TE>   For Chinese twentysomethings who want to embrace the world,
though, Sun prescribes caution. Creativity to create a striking name
is fine, he says, but the strategy can backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "Your name is your personal brand, and it helps people remember
you. But you don't want them to remember you for the wrong reason,"
Sun said. "You really don't want people to say, 'Hey, I'm going out
with Potato and Tomato tonight.' "</TE>

<HD>Cowboy's Killer Evades Justice as Determined Detectives
Persevere</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph B. Frazier</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FOSSIL, Ore.</DL>
<LD>A lone cowboy headed no place in particular rides through the rugged
canyons and hills of Wheeler County, miles from any road or town. A
rifle shot shatters the mountain stillness and, hours later, his
horse and dog show up back home. He doesn't.</LD>
<LD>   Two days later, Indian trackers find the body of James Phillip
Brooks, 23.</LD>
<LD>   That was in 1994. Law officers and the prosecutor in this tiny
county are still scrambling for a motive and evidence to help them
solve the county's first murder since the 1930s.</LD>
<TE>   "We were dead-stalled for seven years," Dist. Atty. Tom Cutsforth
said. "Now we have a whole new list of witnesses, witnesses we should
have had seven years ago. We're going back to zero, to the day it
happened. We're asking, 'What's the most likely scenario?' "</TE>
<TE>   At the time, he said, the investigation concentrated on a logging
crew in the area. "We were headed in the wrong direction. Instead,
we're concentrating on everyone who might have been in the area and
talking to them."</TE>
<TE>   Cutsforth convened a grand jury this year and is in the final
phase of calling some 90 witnesses. "I can't guarantee an
indictment," he said. "But we're going to chase it as far as we can
chase it."</TE>
<TE>   Why anyone would want to kill Brooks, a well-liked rodeo
competitor who had no serious problems with the law, remains a
mystery.</TE>
<TE>   "You might not understand this, but he was a cowboy," said
Cutsforth, himself a product of a small eastern Oregon town. "He got
in some fights with friends and not-so-close friends. He drank a
little bit, and he would stand his ground if he thought he was right
or his pride was hurt. But most cowboys do."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Dave Rouse secured two search warrants but says neither
turned up useful evidence. As for suspects, he said, "We had two
people of interest, but they refused to speak to the grand jury. One
came back and talked. That opened a few doors."</TE>
<TE>   Cutsforth says someone knows what happened, and he won't quit
until he weeds out the rumors and gets some answers.</TE>
<TE>   In small counties, as in small towns, there is talk, and Wheeler
County -- Oregon's least-populous, with 1,500 people -- is no
different. At the Shamrock Lounge, a popular watering hole in this
county seat of 430, Pat Ignowski has held court behind the bar for
six years and has heard just about everything.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about planes that used to fly over the area real low,
with lights on that lit up the whole countryside," Ignowski said.
"They talk about how maybe the kid saw something he shouldn't have."</TE>
<TE>   There are whispers of drugs, he said, but added that there is no
landing strip within many miles of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Rouse says he is inclined to dismiss a drug connection.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd be hard-pressed to grow it up there," he said. "It's real
high. You could probably only get one crop a year."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the trail grows ever colder. "At one point, they had 67
people up there -- in four-wheelers, on horseback and on foot," Rouse
said of the first investigation. "The site was contaminated."</TE>
<TE>   And in a county where the average age is well into the 50s,
witnesses die. Memories dim.</TE>
<TE>   "Cases like this do not age well," Cutsforth said. "They're not
like fine wine."</TE>
<TE>   Given the remoteness of the area, Cutsforth said, Brooks'
encounter with his killer almost certainly was a random one. A lot
can happen unseen in a county with less than one person per square
mile. Possibly the young cowboy was just in the wrong place at the
wrong time.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch where he worked leases hunting rights to a guide
service, and Brooks was killed in the last week of bow-hunting
season. Anybody hunting with a rifle that day was poaching.</TE>
<TE>   Cutsforth said loggers in the area heard a rifle shot. Some say
they heard three. Brooks died of a single shot to the chest.</TE>
<TE>   This is in a county where deer-hunting vies with Christianity as
the dominant faith.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be that he saw someone with a rifle," Cutsforth said.
"Part of his duties was to apprehend trespassers. He may have
confronted somebody who decided it was easier to shoot him than to
deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   There were trespassers in the area the next day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cutsforth says it's possible the killing was an accident but he
will treat it as murder until he knows otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody does know," Cutsforth said. "Whether that person wants
to take it with him to his grave or come clean with us is up to
them."</TE>

<HD>Facts About Fin Whales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peggy Andersen</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Fin whales are Earth's second-largest creature after blue whales,
reaching up to 85 feet long.</LD>
<LD>   Little is known about them because they prefer deep water, where
they "gulp" large quantities of water and prey -- including small
schooling fish, krill and squid -- straining water through plates of
baleen in their mouths as they feed.</LD>
<LD>   They belong to a speedy class of torpedo-shaped whales known as
"rorquals." Sometimes called "the greyhounds of the sea," they can
manage bursts of speed up to 25 knots -- too fast for whaling vessels
propelled by sail.</LD>
<TE>   In time, humans learned to outrun them. Fins were the second
species targeted by efficiently deadly commercial whaling ships,
after blues, and are still recovering from predation that took an
estimated 30,000 of their species annually from 1935 to 1965.</TE>
<TE>   The global population of fin whales -- found in all the world's
oceans -- is unknown, with estimates ranging from 50,000 to 100,000.</TE>
<TE>   They probably have migratory patterns linked to feeding and
breeding. Calves are born at two-year intervals, weaned at six months
and spend months with their mothers.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly gray or brown with white undersides, fin whales have
V-shaped patterns of color around their heads called "chevrons."</TE>

<HD>Ship-Whale Collisions Hint at Shift in Feeding</HD>
<DH>Biologists in Northwest suspect the hungry mammals have
moved into traffic lanes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peggy Andersen</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Over about eight weeks, three ships pulled into Northwest ports with
a fin whale draped over the bulbous bow, a fuel-conserving device
projecting into the ship's path just below the waterline.</LD>
<LD>   The first dead fin whale -- it is the world's second-largest
creature -- arrived at Seattle on the bow of the container ship Tokyo
Express on Aug. 9. The second came into Portland, Ore., on the
auto-transport vessel Ruby Ray on Sept. 2. The third reached a Cherry
Point refinery on the bow of an oil tanker Oct. 2.</LD>
<LD>   It's happened before, but not in such quick succession.</LD>
<TE>   "To have three come in so close together is something we've not
seen before," said Brent Norberg, marine-mammal coordinator for the
National Marine Fisheries Service here.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear why, although scientists speculate that the whales
may have changed feeding patterns -- moving into traffic lanes in
search of prey. It appears that "the food they're grazing on happens
to be on a freeway," Norberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Ship-whale collisions and other encounters -- net entanglements
and propeller hits -- have been an increasing factor in whale deaths
off the nation's coast for some years, raising concerns among
biologists. Ships are getting bigger and faster, while populations of
the now-protected whales are increasing.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent cases, tests indicate two of the whales were alive
when they were struck. Damage to the Portland carcass suggests that
it was already dead.</TE>
<TE>   The carcasses, which ranged from 35 to 60 feet long, apparently
were tucked up against the vessels by the bulbous bows. The
odd-shaped projection has greatly increased fuel efficiency through
"wave-making resistance reduction technology" developed in the early
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   A bulbous bow would prevent a struck animal simply rolling off to
the side, Norberg said. There is no research on whether bulbous-bow
technology could be a factor in whale deaths, he added. . The
percentage of bulbous-bow ships involved in collisions with whales is
not known.</TE>
<TE>   Crews "are as surprised as anyone when they pull in and the animal
is there," he said. The ships weigh thousands of tons: "That's a
massive object moving through the water;" striking a whale would be
"kind of like hitting a noodle with your car."</TE>
<TE>   The remains of the two whales that probably were alive when struck
were quite fresh when they reached port, Norberg said, which suggests
that the strikes occurred as the vessels neared their journey's end.</TE>
<TE>   That reduces the chance that a whale strike would be noticed, he
said. When ships near port, they are busy taking on pilots to
navigate inland waters, slowing to enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca
and making other routine changes in operational strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Also, "crew size is going down as vessel speed and size are going
up," noted activist Fred Felleman of Ocean Advocates. "And even if
somebody did see a whale, it's not like a big ship can turn on a
dime."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike toothed whales, baleen whales such as fin whales do not
echo-locate -- a method of detecting objects and food by creating a
series of clicks and interpreting the reflected sound. Even so,
scientists believe that they have very sensitive hearing. And today's
bigger, faster ships generate "significant amounts of noise," said
whale expert John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research in Olympia.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with few natural enemies, whales may not consider an
approaching vessel a threat.</TE>
<TE>   "These animals evolved over millions of years," Calambokidis said.
"The arrival of huge ships that travel 20 or more knots is a very
recent development -- recent as in the last 100 years. It's nothing
they're equipped or have evolved to recognize as a threat."</TE>

<HD>From Credit-Card Junkie to Internet Beggar</HD>
<DH>When she found herself $20,000 in debt after overspending
and losing her job, she got the idea for a Web site. But condemnation
comes with the cash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lukas I. Alpert</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>After an 18-month bacchanal buying Manolo Blahnik, Gucci and Prada,
Karyn Bosnak found herself unemployed with more than $20,000 in
credit card debt.</LD>
<LD>   When Bosnak, 29, spotted a sign in a supermarket with an odd
request -- "Wanted: $7,000 To Pay Off Debt" -- it made perfect sense.
The television producer launched a similar appeal to a much larger
audience: the World Wide Web.</LD>
<LD>   Internet panhandling was born.</LD>
<TE>   Now, more than 3 1/2 months after launching www.savekaryn.com,
Bosnak has received more than $13,000 from hundreds of donors
worldwide. Coupled with the online auction of the high-ticket items
that drove her into debt, plus earnings from a new job, as of Nov. 10
she was debt-free.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I figured it wouldn't work, but I could collect some
stories out of it and maybe I'd write a book," she said. "But it must
have struck some sort of a chord because people just started sending
me money.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess many people can relate to debt."</TE>
<TE>   But for every person who feels her pain or simply admires her
creativity, there is another who condemns her method. One angry
e-mailer wished that she would die of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   And there's the Internet backlash, with anti-Karyn sites like
www.dontsavekaryn.com, which promises to "waste your money in
inventive and creative ways."</TE>
<TE>   Or www.savekarynnot.com, which asks people to donate money to
charity rather than finance Bosnak's "bikini wax binge and Prada
party."</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I would offend anyone," she said. "I guess I was
wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the venture has been an undeniable success, landing Bosnak
in People magazine and on NBC's "Today" show. Even better, the money
she collected was tax-free -- considered a gift, according to the
Internal Revenue Service.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnak says she has even been approached by a publisher for a
possible book deal and a producer about selling the movie rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue of timing and a great concept, and of course great
word of mouth," said Frank Catalano, author of "Internet Marketing
for Dummies."</TE>
<TE>   "Stuff like this is not easily replicable. It utilizes the
water-cooler factor," he said. "But really, it's an inspired
anomaly."</TE>
<TE>   He said he doesn't find the bipolar response surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to stand up in public and flash people, some
folks will take photos and others will throw ice water on you," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnak's financial troubles began when she moved to New York from
Chicago in May 2000, near the end of the economic boom. She had just
taken a job as a producer for King World Productions on a short-lived
reality courtroom program called "Curtis Court."</TE>
<TE>   Earning "well over $100,000 a year," Karyn rented an expensive
apartment in midtown Manhattan within walking distance of Henri
Bendel, Bergdorf Goodman and Bloomingdale's.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know that many people here, so I just walked around
checking out the city and I'd end up buying things," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Which meant charging $400 Prada sling-back shoes, $500 Gucci
purses, pedicures and $150 trips to the hair salon on her six credit
cards.</TE>
<TE>   "In my mind, I was making a lot of money, so I should live like I
make a lot of money," she said. "Spending $500 on a Gucci purse
didn't seem like a big deal."</TE>
<TE>   But after the failure of "Curtis Court" and a stint with the even
shorter-lived "Ananda Lewis Show," Bosnak found herself out of a job
and faced with an enormous debt in the shaky post-Sept. 11 economy.</TE>
<TE>   "I got really depressed," she said. "And then I snapped back into
reality."</TE>
<TE>   First, she moved from her midtown digs to a more modest, shared
apartment in Brooklyn. For the next four months, she was unemployed
and living la vida frugal -- no more trips to the beauty shop, no
more nights on the town.</TE>
<TE>   In April, she finally got a job on the Animal Planet show "Dog
Days," but took more than a 50% pay cut. After doing the math, she
figured that it would take 40 years to pay off her debt. Then she saw
the sign in the supermarket, and the rest is history.</TE>
<TE>   Bosnak says any money she receives after clearing her debt will go
to charity.</TE>
<TE>   "Also, if this movie thing should happen, then I'll match whatever
everyone gave me and give it to charity," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But has she really learned her lesson?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yes, definitely," she said. "Becoming the face of consumer
debt was not necessarily a situation I wanted to find myself in, and
I certainly would never want to find my way here again."</TE>

<LD>The story of the investigation into John T. Veysey III is based on
interviews with numerous officials, including Pat Layng and Lori
Lightfoot of the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago; members of the
Cary, Ill., police, including Chief Ron Delelio, Deputy Chief Ed
Fetzer and former Det. Denise Bradstreet; Cary firefighters Brad
Dellatore, Andy Veath, Scott Mohr and Robert Deau; U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agents Jack Malooly, Tina Sherrow, Jane
Balkema and Jim Allison; Deserie Beetle and her mother, Irene Beetle;
Betty and Gerald DeBruyne, and Kathleen Hilkin. It also draws on
thousands of pages of court testimony, as well as a transcript of an
interview conducted by Sherrow and John Korth, a sheriff's deputy in
Jo Daviess County, Ill. Through his attorney, Veysey declined to be
interviewed.</LD>

<HD>Rice Insists Bush Is Focusing on Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Struggling to account for a torrent of fresh threat warnings and the
reappearance of Osama bin Laden, the Bush administration scrambled
Friday to defend its handling of the war on terrorism and to counter
criticism that it is preoccupied with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice bristled at questions
about the administration's priorities, saying President Bush's first
order of business each day is assessing the nation's progress against
Al Qaeda and other terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   "He does not begin his day on Iraq," Rice said. "He begins his day
on the war on terrorism and the threat levels, and the threat
information that we have about the United States."</LD>
<TE>   The administration sought to bolster its case by presenting new
evidence of success against Al Qaeda, declaring that one of the
terrorist network's top operatives recently was captured and is in
U.S. custody. Officials declined to identify the figure.</TE>
<TE>   Rice's remarks and disclosure of the capture were part of a
concerted White House effort to blunt renewed criticism from
lawmakers and foreign leaders that the hunt for Al Qaeda is failing
from neglect.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany on Friday, Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher warned that
the administration's focus on Iraq is dangerously misguided.</TE>
<TE>   "International terrorism is the No. 1 danger," Fischer told the
German Parliament. "I need it explained to me how we ended up making
Iraq the priority."</TE>
<TE>   The White House is sensitive to second-guessing largely because of
Bin Laden's reappearance, as well as a flurry of ominous new
intelligence signals.</TE>
<TE>   Citing an increase in intelligence traffic not seen since before
the Sept. 11 attacks, the FBI issued an alert late Thursday that Al
Qaeda might be planning spectacular new strikes at the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's developments underscore how the White House increasingly
finds itself in the seemingly contradictory position of claiming
significant success in disabling Al Qaeda even as it warns that the
nation might be no safer now than it was before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Rice straddled both those positions, recounting the success of the
war in Afghanistan and citing "numerous senior leaders of Al Qaeda
that have either been eliminated, incarcerated, or detained
someplace."</TE>
<TE>   She stressed that Al Qaeda is "an adaptable organization."</TE>

<HD>Rubble of a House Fire Offers Tantalizing Clues</HD>
<DH>A smoke detector with no battery, guidebooks for setting
fires and making bombs are found. Callers offer tips about the owner.</DH>
<SE>Second in a Weekly Series</SE>

<DL>CARY, Ill.</DL>
<LD>THE STORY SO FAR</LD>
<LD>   Fire destroyed John Veysey's house in Cary, Ill., leaving his wife
and 3-year-old son struggling for life. Veysey himself survived, but
a local detective doubted his story of jumping from a window to
summon help. Then a caller told authorities about other suspicious
fires in Veysey's past.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   CARY, Ill. -- The scent of charred wood hung in the frosty air as
Det. Ron Delelio stepped around pools of standing water and holes
where flames had eaten away the floorboards.</TE>
<TE>   Burned furniture, clothing and toys were everywhere -- a family's
worldly possessions fried into an amorphous mess. Somewhere a
generator was humming. A contractor was surveying the fire damage.</TE>
<TE>   Near the foot of the basement stairs in what had been John
Veysey's home, Delelio spotted something that stopped him cold. A
smoke detector hung open without a battery. Then nearby, mixed in a
pile of clothing, he saw a 9-volt battery.</TE>
<TE>   Delelio wasn't taking written notes. But an experienced cop always
makes mental notes, and the empty smoke detector got a page all to
itself.</TE>
<TE>   It came on top of tips from callers to the police station only
hours after the fire the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   Most were anonymous. People who knew John T. Veysey III didn't
like him and they told Delelio some intriguing things:</TE>
<TE>   * His first wife died mysteriously.</TE>
<TE>   * He didn't seem to work, yet he lived comfortably.</TE>
<TE>   * He collected big insurance payouts.</TE>
<TE>   In 15 years as a cop, Delelio had developed a theory about police
work: 98% is common sense. And common sense told him that Veysey,
this seemingly respectable family man, was a fraud and a liar.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe something even worse.</TE>
<TE>   Proving it would be hard work. Delelio was used to that.</TE>
<TE>   He'd grown up outside Chicago, one of 13 children in a family that
struggled to get by. Their three-bedroom home in rural Wonder Lake
was so crowded that some kids slept on the living room floor.</TE>
<TE>   At 11, Delelio was washing dishes in a pizza parlor. He dropped
out of high school but later got a college degree. His dream was to
be a police officer, like his grandfather.</TE>
<TE>   If you wanted something, he'd learned, there was one way to get
it: hard work. What he wanted now was to find out what really
happened in that fire.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When Deserie Veysey woke up in the hospital four days after the
High Road inferno, she had no memory of it, no sense of how close she
had come to dying.</TE>
<TE>   As she looked around, she saw her mother, Irene Beetle; her
husband, John; her 8-month-old daughter, Sabrina; her sister, Denise;
her father-in-law, Tom Veysey.</TE>
<TE>   And her stepson, Little John. He was there too. He was OK.</TE>
<TE>   Both had suffered smoke inhalation and were treated in hyperbaric
chambers, which increase oxygen levels and help the body eliminate
smoke-borne toxins.</TE>
<TE>   Deserie was accustomed to hospitals, having undergone repeated
surgeries through childhood to correct a birth defect that left her
nose misshapen.</TE>
<TE>   She was hoarse now from tubes inserted in her throat, and she hurt
from severe burns on her leg, hand and face. Her whole body felt taut
and stretched. Bits of melted carpet still clung to her fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   But she was breathing. She was alive.</TE>
<TE>   How had she gotten here? What had happened?</TE>
<TE>   John was the hero, her father-in-law kept saying. It was John, he
said, who saved them all.</TE>
<TE>   John told her that she had discovered the fire when she got up in
the middle of the night, threw him a fire extinguisher -- which
turned out not to work -- and struggled in vain to crank open a
window.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he said, he took a running jump and plunged through the
double-glass window, landing in the snow nine feet below. He called
it a "Ninja roll."</TE>
<TE>   He caught Sabrina when Deserie lowered her through the broken
window, he said, but then couldn't get back inside after running for
help.</TE>
<TE>   Deserie didn't remember any of this. Not a single detail.</TE>
<TE>   She remembered coming home about 9:30 p.m., changing into pajamas,
spooning herself a bowl of Moose Tracks ice cream and getting
ensconced on the couch near the Christmas tree to watch TV.</TE>
<TE>   John had asked if she wanted a glass of water -- not the type of
thing he normally did. The last thing she remembered was drinking it.</TE>
<TE>   Deserie spent five days in the hospital before being released.</TE>
<TE>   They all moved in with John's parents. But instead of sharing a
room with her husband, Deserie found herself upstairs with her
stepson. Veysey explained that he didn't want to risk hurting her if
he thrashed around in bed.</TE>
<TE>   Since the blaze, John had changed. He was cool and distant. He
never asked how she felt, never kissed her. He never said he was
happy she'd survived. One morning, Deserie went downstairs, lay next
to John on the sofa bed and wrapped her arms around him. He remained
rigid.</TE>
<TE>   It was just one more sign that something was terribly wrong. She
would never heal there, she thought. She wanted to be coddled, as her
mother had done when she was sick as a little girl.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few days, Deserie moved out -- it was the beginning of
the end of their marriage.</TE>
<TE>   She moved with Sabrina to her mother's house outside Rockford,
where, two days later, there was a knock at the door. It was Delelio,
with fellow Cary Det. Denise Bradstreet.</TE>
<TE>   In the family room, where Deserie sat with her bandaged leg
propped up, Bradstreet asked about her burns. She asked about the
children. Then she got to the point:</TE>
<TE>   "We're concerned about your safety; that's why we drove out here.
There are some things that lead us to believe this wasn't an
accident."</TE>
<TE>   As Bradstreet spoke, Deserie thought about how aloof John had
become. Listening, she let an idea that would have once been
unthinkable slowly take hold: John had set the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Bradstreet had expected Deserie to protest, "No, not my husband,
John." Instead, her response took the detective by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," she said calmly. "What do you want me to do?"</TE>
<TE>   The detectives needed information, they explained; then they
carefully broached a possible motive: insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Deserie said, after their wedding, she and John had taken out
$500,000 life insurance policies on each other. There had been a
$50,000 policy on Little John; it had lapsed a month earlier when a
renewal notice was sent to the wrong address and never forwarded.
There was no policy on Sabrina.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next few weeks, Deserie made daily visits to the small
investigations room on the second floor of the police department, and
her life story unfolded.</TE>
<TE>   She had met John in 1996 through a personals ad in the paper. She
was on the rebound from a long relationship that had gone bad -- and
now she was ready to start a family.</TE>
<TE>   She remembered what he wore the day they met: tight white jeans,
aqua shirt and gray suede shoes. At first, she'd been put off by
that, but soon he won her over.</TE>
<TE>   John would send her lush bouquets for no special reason. She felt
comfortable around him. He was intelligent, dependable, someone she
could count on.</TE>
<TE>   As for work, he told her that he dabbled in commodity futures
trading.</TE>
<TE>   They were married in 1997, a month before Sabrina's birth.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives were amazed by Deserie's command of details.
Although she didn't remember the fire, there were some unsettling
things she could recall.</TE>
<TE>   When they started dating in the summer of 1996, John was living in
the Galena home that he'd shared with his first wife, who had died 15
months earlier. In December 1996, fire damaged that house. And
something he said soon afterward struck Deserie as odd.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to arrest me," she remembered him telling her.
"They're going to think I did it."</TE>
<TE>   But that fire was ruled accidental. And he collected $266,382 in
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Another strange thing happened later, Deserie told the detectives.
It was January 1998, two days before the fire on High Road in Cary.</TE>
<TE>   She came home from work and Veysey told her not to read her mail.
He needed some fresh air. With the kids, they piled into her car and
went for a ride, skidding on icy streets.</TE>
<TE>   That night, Deserie opened her bank statement and discovered that
two checks written by John -- for $2,500 and $500 -- had bounced.
Just a bookkeeping error, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deserie gave the detectives copies of insurance policies. She went
to the library and tracked down a copy of a personals ad that Veysey
had placed with the headline: "Sleepless In Galena."</TE>
<TE>   Delelio started collecting everything in a three-ring binder and
put together a timeline. But it was becoming clear that he needed
help: This case, which had moved far beyond the boundaries of Cary,
Ill., was getting too big for him.</TE>
<TE>   He invited county, state and federal officials in and laid out
what he had learned, what he suspected and what he felt was beyond
his reach.</TE>
<TE>   This would be a turning point. Federal involvement would mean the
power to subpoena crucial bank and insurance records in different
states.</TE>
<TE>   It would bring in arson and financial specialists that a
small-town police department couldn't match.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the promised help, Delelio kept a hand in the case. He
returned to search the High Road house, again and again.</TE>
<TE>   On one visit, he discovered the pieces of another melted smoke
detector, this one in the second-floor hallway. It had no battery,
just like one in the basement. That was strange, considering that
Deserie had told him Veysey had tested it and found it working just a
month before the fire.</TE>
<TE>   In the master bedroom, he found a package with a charred wrapper.
Inside was "The Anarchist's Cookbook," containing recipes for making
bombs.</TE>
<TE>   And in the exercise room, there were two volumes of "The Poor
Man's James Bond" with instructions for setting fires and using
exotic poisons.</TE>
<TE>   Another day, Delelio returned to the bedroom from which Veysey
claimed he had jumped. Picking up shards of glass, he looked for
dried blood or pieces of cloth. Nothing. He scanned the window frame,
just 2 feet wide. Veysey was big -- 6-foot-5, 220 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Again, no torn cloth or blood.</TE>
<TE>   Delelio went to work with a screwdriver. He removed the wooden
frame and put it in his squad car.</TE>
<TE>   Someday, he thought, this will be important evidence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next week: A master arson sleuth has his own suspicions.</TE>

<HD>Purdue Knocks on Wood to Produce Sturdier Trees</HD>
<DH>Scientists seek to create faster-growing, disease-
resistant hardwoods, including black walnut, black cherry and
northern red oak.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rick Callahan</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Molecular biologist Keith Woeste squats down among rows of young,
musky-smelling black walnut trees and grasps one tree's trunk to eye
a slender branch.</LD>
<LD>   These aren't ordinary black walnut trees -- they're integral to an
ambitious bid by Purdue University scientists to create
faster-growing, richer-grained and disease-resistant hardwood trees.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is superior black walnut, black cherry and northern red
oak trees -- a trio coveted by the fine furniture and wood flooring
industry -- that can be planted by the millions in tree plantations.</LD>
<TE>   "If we can domesticate hardwood trees, that means you can
eventually leave the wild ones where they are in the woods because
you've made something that's better," Woeste said.</TE>
<TE>   For generations, people have been breeding better crops, fruit and
decorative trees and prettier flowers. But until recently, there has
been little work on improving hardwood trees.</TE>
<TE>   Woeste believes that they can grow better hardwoods through a
combination of classical breeding and biotechnology to give a boost
to the nation's $14-billion-a-year hardwood industry.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers are crossbreeding the most desirable black walnut
trees at Purdue's experimental tree farm using grafted limbs selected
from 400 different trees. They hope to produce black walnut trees
with a higher percentage of heartwood -- the durable, coffee-dark
wood made into expensive furniture.</TE>
<TE>   Similar work is under way on black cherry and northern red oak at
the center, a partnership created in 1998 between Purdue, the U.S.
Forest Service and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.</TE>
<TE>   But the big leap forward may come when researchers begin
genetically modifying select trees by inserting genes into embryonic
trees with such sought-after traits as insect resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Within five years, the center's scientists hope to have created a
new black walnut tree equipped with a gene that makes it resistant to
herbicides. Such trees would boost large-scale hardwood tree farming
by allowing tree farmers to kill weeds that threaten to choke out
young plantation trees without damaging the trees themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers then will work to insert insect-resistant genes into
black cherry trees to ward off attacks by insect borers that ruin the
trees' value.</TE>
<TE>   If such improved trees eventually emerge, the center will be able
to use simple biotechnology to produce millions of cloned seedlings
for planting in the nation's central hardwood region.</TE>
<TE>   This 12-state area, stretching from Iowa to Pennsylvania to
Tennessee, originally was covered by dense forests filled with
towering oaks, walnuts and other ancient hardwoods. Nearly all of
these old-growth forests were felled in the 19th century, in part to
help build the East Coast's great cities.</TE>
<TE>   Although demand for North America's hardwood trees grows each
year, there is an annual shortfall of about 55 million seedlings.</TE>
<TE>   Breeding efforts for loblolly and slash pines in the South have
had the kind of success that Purdue is hoping for. By crossbreeding
the most productive trees and developing "seed zones" that dictate
where each improved variety should be planted, the inventory of wood
from those trees has been boosted by 70%.</TE>
<TE>   The Purdue center, which has a staff of 33 and a yearly budget of
about $1.5 million, is surveying hardwood forests in the Midwest as
part of its goal of creating similar hardwood seed zones.</TE>
<TE>   But its research goes beyond industrial production issues to
assessing the biodiversity of the remaining hardwood forests.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 90% of the nation's annual hardwood production comes from
private forests averaging less than 100 acres -- small patches that
Woeste describes as "lifeboats of diversity."</TE>
<TE>   The best and biggest trees are typically taken during periodic
harvests, and that could fuel the gradual decline in the size of
hardwoods reaching the marketplace, said Paul Houghland Jr.,
executive manager of the National Hardwood Lumber Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "The overall picture has been that the trees that are being
harvested now are smaller than they were 50 years ago. And smaller
trees mean you need more of them to get the same amount of lumber,"
said Houghland, whose Memphis, Tenn.-based trade association
represents hardwood producers and users.</TE>
<TE>   More disconcerting than the size of the harvested trees is concern
that stunted, diseased or otherwise undesirable trees left behind
could weaken the genetic pool of hardwood species.</TE>
<TE>   The Purdue center is cataloging and preserving tissue from a full
spectrum of each species because many rare selections are in danger
of becoming extinct.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Romero-Severson, an assistant professor of quantitative
genetics, is leading the center's northern red oak project. Her task
has particular urgency because oaks used for superior wood flooring
are not long-lived -- 250 years at most.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now reaching the end of the natural life cycle of the trees
that were here before the wave of European colonization, and we'd
like to be able to capture that genetic diversity before it's gone,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike black walnut and black cherry, northern red oak cannot be
grown from cuttings, but Romero-Severson is hopeful that the center
can overcome that roadblock.</TE>
<TE>   Her work surveying Indiana's older growth forests has already led
to the discovery that two old-growth woods in southern Indiana
contain unique northern red oak populations. The stands are
descendants of trees destroyed when mile-high glaciers flattened the
northern half of Indiana about 14,000 years ago during the last Ice
Age, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The center's staff is always on the hunt for seeds or branches of
rare trees, such as those with curly or wavy grains that can fetch 10
to 50 times the price of normal grained hardwoods.</TE>
<TE>   The hardwood-improving genetic technologies the center develops
could also help ward off future disease threats such as a fungus
threatening California's majestic oaks and redwoods.</TE>
<TE>   "It's diseases like that we need to be prepared for because we
know that hardwood trees -- the American chestnut, the American elm,
for example -- can be decimated in a matter of decades by disease,"
Woeste said.</TE>

<HD>Hospital Stay Proves No Handicap to This Wedding</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HARRIMAN, Tenn</DL>
<LD>HARRIMAN, Tenn. -- The bride wore white bandages from head to broken
foot. The groom, in a donated tuxedo, stood unsteadily at her
hospital bedside.</LD>
<LD>   Jimmi Langley and Ronnie Ray, 18-year-old survivors of a deadly
tornado that swept through their mountain community last Sunday,
exchanged vows in the intensive care unit Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   They tied the knot just one day late by moving the ceremony from a
church to the bride's room at Roane Medical Center, where she was
being treated for two broken arms, the broken foot and other
injuries. Her bridegroom, with numerous cuts and bruises, arrived in
a wheelchair.</LD>
<TE>   "Will you love him, comfort him, honor and keep him in sickness
and in health ... so long as you both shall live?" asked the Rev.
Stewart Slone, pastor of their Church of God of Prophecy in Petros.</TE>
<TE>   "I do," Jimmi said with a weak voice and a bright smile.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie lifted Jimmi's veil and kissed her. They celebrated with
sparkling apple cider.</TE>
<TE>   Their community of Mossy Grove in eastern Tennessee was one of the
hardest hit when more than 70 tornadoes cut a path of destruction
from Louisiana to Pennsylvania over the weekend. Thirty-six people
were killed, including 17 in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Ronnie and Jimmi had planned to marry in church Wednesday, exactly
two years after they met. Then came the tornado. The couple took
shelter in his mobile home, hiding in the bathtub under heavy
blankets.</TE>
<TE>   "The trailer was completely annihilated," hospital spokeswoman
Karen Martin said. "When they came to, they were in different
places." The bathtub -- with Jimmi still in it -- landed across the
street from the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were reunited at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmi told nurses that she had lost her home, but she wouldn't
lose her wedding. "I had to have more surgery Tuesday and we couldn't
do it," she said. "I was determined not to put it off any longer."</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever she wants," Ronnie told the hospital staff. "Good
answer," the nurses told him.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts from a wedding shower a week before, their rings, even her
salon-styled fingernails were gone, so the hospital staff and local
merchants pitched in.</TE>
<TE>   A marriage license was secured to replace the one blown away,
white netting decorated the room, and an off-the-rack wedding dress
was fashioned into a one-of-a-kind hospital gown.</TE>
<TE>   Her parents, his mother and two aunts attended the 15-minute
ceremony. A nursing supervisor sang a cappella.</TE>
<TE>   "When the nurses mentioned it, I said it sounded like a good
idea," Jimmi said of her hospital-bed wedding. "I didn't expect it to
be this big, though."</TE>

<HD>60-Foot Lava Lamp Plan Is Just Plain Groovy</HD>
<DH>Residents of a rural Washington town hope a monument to
glowing, undulating ooze would boost the economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Ashton</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SOAP LAKE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Brent Blake and John Glassco want to light the way to this little
town in central Washington's coulee country with the world's largest
Lava lamp -- a 60-foot monument to glowing, undulating ooze.</LD>
<LD>   But don't go pulling out the Iron Butterfly eight-tracks and love
beads just yet -- this isn't a flashback to the 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   "There's more to it than a Lava lamp. It's an economic development
issue," said Blake, a ponytailed architect and designer who divides
his time between Soap Lake and Gig Harbor on Puget Sound.</LD>
<TE>   The director of the Grant County Economic Development Council,
Terry Brewer, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's right on point there," Brewer said.</TE>
<TE>   Soap Lake, population 1,275, is something of a rarity east of the
Cascade Range, a rural town without a grain elevator or a railroad
spur.</TE>
<TE>   It exists as a sort of a faded "Wellville" with a small,
mineral-rich lake that once attracted hordes of health-conscious
travelers intent on taking the foamy, healing waters and coating
themselves with mud.</TE>
<TE>   But the lake -- about 150 miles east of Seattle and 110 miles west
of Spokane -- isn't the draw it was a generation or two ago, Brewer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Soap Lake has had a shriveling economy for a number of years," he
said. "We need someone or something to create the kind of activity or
interest to get the little economic engine spinning again."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, 60, and friend Glassco, 54, an environmental services
consultant who lives here, came up with the idea on a whim during a
late-night chat, and both insist they never owned Lava lamps in their
youth.</TE>
<TE>   The design and the engineering are fluid right now, with lots of
sketches in a book and specs that are uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the lamp would be 60 feet tall, with a diameter of 18
feet.</TE>
<TE>   The top cap would have a searchlight that would shine vertically
for 50 miles. A catwalk would surround the glass cylinder where it
meets the base to form an observation platform.</TE>
<TE>   Blake said he has no cost estimate, but he'd like to have it built
in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Blake has enlisted the help of the state Office of Community,
Trade and Economic Development to try to make his Lava lamp vision
real.</TE>
<TE>   George Sharp, a tourism development account manager for the
development office, is there to help Blake explore the feasibility of
and financing options for the project, along with brainstorming ways
to have it make money.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want it to be just like the largest ball of twine --
where you come look and you're done," Sharp said.</TE>
<TE>   Times are tough for businesses here. People on their way to Grand
Coulee Dam or Sun Lakes State Park don't see much reason for
stopping.</TE>
<TE>   It's not for lack of trying. An intimate 144-seat theater is under
construction on Main Street for the local Masquers troupe and other
visiting performers. There's a Sun Lakes Photography Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Soap Lake took a shot at the Wild West theme years ago, but the
North Cascades town of Winthrop did it better. Two restaurants are
boarded up and for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The lake itself and the high-desert sunshine remain the primary
attractions, from the start of fishing season in the spring through
hunting season in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Both hotels, the rosy Inn at Soap Lake and the rustic Notaras
Lodge, have guest rooms where visitors can choose between fresh water
and lake water for their baths.</TE>
<TE>   Barney and Gerry Ballor, en route to Tacoma from Bay City, Mich.,
stopped here briefly with their granddaughter's pug dog, Blackberry,
after reading about Soap Lake in a brochure in their Moses Lake motel
room.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to come here in the summer and go swimming," Gerry
Ballor said.</TE>
<TE>   And both agreed they would probably stop to see the world's
largest Lava lamp.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp believes there are many ways to make a 60-foot-tall Lava
lamp a destination, with changing interpretive exhibitions on
everything from the geology of the area to natural healing techniques
to the history of the Lava lamp itself.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd rather have attention for something like this than no
attention at all," Brewer said.</TE>
<TE>   Ideally, Blake would like to see Soap Lake end up an eclectic,
artsy little community.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much potential here. It's frustrating to walk down the
street," Glassco said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just makes you want to make something happen," Blake added.</TE>
<TE>   The city has given its blessing. "You have really started a
wake-up call here and created interest in the community with this
idea," Mayor Ken Lee wrote in a letter of support.</TE>
<TE>   Even Chicago-based Haggerty Enterprises, which owns the rights to
the Lava brand motion lamp, seems to think it's a groovy plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We would definitely work with them in any way we could to
maximize this," Vanessa Patrick said.</TE>

<HD>Minor Quakes Elsewhere Tied to Alaska Temblor</HD>
<DH>Seismic instruments record increased activity as far away
as California. Link with movement in volcanic zones is possible,
scientists say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Bridges</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The magnitude 7.9 earthquake that rocked Alaska on Nov. 3 has lent
new credence to the theory that large temblors can trigger seismic
activity even thousands of miles away.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately after the earthquake, the largest to strike on land
since the 1906 quake that leveled most of San Francisco, seismic
instruments recorded increased activity as far away as California.
There, swarms of tiny temblors shook the Geysers, north of San
Francisco, and Long Valley, in the eastern Sierra.</LD>
<LD>   Similar minor quakes were recorded at Washington's Mt. Rainier and
in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, all volcanic areas.</LD>
<TE>   Most seismologists agree that the quakes were triggered by the
temblor on Alaska's Denali fault.</TE>
<TE>   "There can't be any question at this point that the phenomenon
does occur and probably more frequently than we thought before," said
David Hill, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1992's magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake in the desert east
of Los Angeles that first suggested to seismologists that remotely
triggered quakes were possible.</TE>
<TE>   In the minutes, hours and days after that quake, instruments
recorded upticks in seismic activity near Lassen Peak, Long Valley,
the Geysers and Little Skull Mountain in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Before Landers, which was among the first large earthquakes to
strike in the era of modern seismic instruments, seismologists could
not definitively link temblors that struck in close succession but
were separated by large distances.</TE>
<TE>   In California, earthquakes come nearly every minute of every day;
that any two should strike in different locations within the state at
the same time is usually no more than mere coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   "There's one problem we face, and that's people like to correlate
things," said David Wald, USGS seismologist. "People like to see
patterns."</TE>
<TE>   Now with more and better instruments deployed in the field,
seismologists can discern any change in the background levels of
seismic activity that might indicate earthquakes triggered by
distant, larger quakes.</TE>
<TE>   Some still do not accept the theory that they trigger one another,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "So what, there are earthquakes all the time, right? You'd be
hard-pressed to tie it to that," said Christopher Scholz of the
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University.</TE>
<TE>   Scholz does allow that earthquakes can trigger seismic activity in
volcanic zones, as was the case with the Denali quake.</TE>
<TE>   Since Landers, seismologists have pored over historical records,
looking for accounts of past earthquakes that may have triggered
other temblors, even in nonvolcanic areas.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Hough, USGS seismologist, said the three strong earthquakes
that hit New Madrid, Mo., in the winter of 1811-12 triggered quakes
as far away as northern Kentucky -- hardly a volcanic region.</TE>
<TE>   "There is compelling evidence that it's happened in areas that are
not volcanic," Hough said.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Wald and student Aron Meltzner spent more than a
year studying newspaper accounts from the time of the April 18, 1906,
San Francisco earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   They found what they called a "marked clustering" of earthquakes
in the West in the 48 hours after the estimated magnitude 7.8 quake.</TE>
<TE>   They attribute the change to aftershocks and triggered quakes.
(The difference between the two is largely one of distance -- and
semantics, seismologists said.)</TE>
<TE>   Among them were earthquakes reported in Oregon, Arizona and
Southern California, including an estimated magnitude 5 quake that
struck off the Los Angeles coast on April 19, 1906.</TE>
<TE>   "There are clear effects at great distances from these
earthquakes," Wald said of those of large magnitude.</TE>
<TE>   How they trigger other quakes remains unclear, although the
apparent tie to volcanic areas is a clue, said Joan Gomberg, USGS
seismologist.</TE>
<TE>   "These volcanic areas seem to be more sensitive, for whatever
reasons," Gomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the theories is that the shaking redistributes bubbles of
gas trapped in the magma underlying volcanic regions, Gomberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Seismologists caution that triggered earthquakes seem to occur
only in areas that are already seismically active.</TE>
<TE>   "They're already primed in some sense for producing earthquakes,"
Hill said.</TE>

<HD>A Different Pringle? Maybe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's Latino activists show cautious willingness to give
Curt Pringle a second chance after his past transgressions. The newly
elected mayor of Anaheim should remember, though, that he has a long
way to go in showing that he deserves their trust.</LD>
<LD>   The ugly event occurred in 1988, but it's hard to forget the time
Pringle's campaign stationed uniformed, private guards at polling
places in Santa Ana, where some of them challenged Latino voters and
demanded identification. The GOP and Pringle, then a Republican
assemblyman, eventually paid a $400,000 settlement.</LD>
<LD>   The Latino community got revenge 10 years later with a campaign
reminding voters of the shameful episode -- helping bring about
Pringle's stinging defeat for state treasurer.</LD>
<TE>   The two sides were on more amicable terms during Pringle's
successful run for mayor. That's because he took the unexpected step
of siding with a Mexican supermarket chain in its bid to open an
Anaheim store.</TE>
<TE>   City officials had expressed concern that the store was too Latino
in theme for the regional shopping center in question. But the City
Council ultimately approved the liquor license that the Gigante store
needed in order to open.</TE>
<TE>   By joining a pro-Gigante rally, Pringle at minimum showed himself
a practical politician who recognizes the county's rapidly changing
demographics. Anaheim's population is almost half Latino, and though
Latinos now make up only a fifth of its voters, that too will change
in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   Such high-profile activists as Nativo Lopez now say such things as
"Curt Pringle of 2002 is not the Curt Pringle of 1988. I don't think
he's the same person ideologically."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps. So far, all that Pringle has shown is that he's not the
same person pragmatically. The Gigante controversy was a no-brainer,
at least for almost everyone but the city's misguided redevelopment
director, who expressed dismay that the market's signs were in
Spanish as well as English. The chain's U.S. stores are clean,
successful, popular additions to the ethnic-foods sector, as the
Anaheim store is certain to be. The rally came at a good time for a
political appearance: in August, close enough to the elections to
make an impact. It also fit neatly into the Republican's ideological
support for business in the face of government regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Still unknown is how Pringle will react when it comes to providing
city services that affect Latinos, or dealing with the Latino
community's ongoing discomfort with the Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Pringle offers equivocal explanations about the poll guards. He
didn't know about the uniforms, he says, or that his campaign paid
for the signs saying that illegal immigrants cannot vote. Better
would be an acknowledgment of his responsibility for his own
campaign, along with an apology.</TE>
<TE>   But the Latino community appears willing to forgo all that. It
rightly would prefer to build a strong relationship with its new
mayor. Pringle has laid some good groundwork; now the real work
begins.</TE>

<HD>Waging a Worthy Tax Battle</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody likes to pay taxes, but the burden grows particularly heavy
when the assembled evidence suggests that you're carrying more than
your fair share. That's why the system has checks and balances to
guarantee suspicious taxpayers their day in court.</LD>
<LD>   But if your name is William Bunker, make that days, weeks, months
and years spent in court.</LD>
<LD>   The San Juan Capistrano homeowner began fighting for a property
tax reduction in 1992. Bunker suspected that Orange County had broken
a state law by not granting him the property tax refund, and a state
appeals court this month sided with the irate homeowner.</LD>
<TE>   Bunker's victory is good news for an estimated 1,500 property
owners who also might qualify for property tax refunds based on
appeals filed during the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Bunker's odyssey began when the sagging economy sent local
property tax values plummeting. The county assessor's office had set
the value of Bunker's home at $940,221 for the 1992-93 tax year.
Bunker filed an appeal on Sept. 6, 1992, arguing that the recession
had knocked the value of his property down to $770,000.</TE>
<TE>   By law, Orange County should have responded to Bunker's appeal
within two years. But the rejection letter wasn't posted for 26
months. It was an expensive decision because county assessors who
miss the review deadline must stick with the property owner's
proposed value for a property.</TE>
<TE>   The tale has an added twist. A month after the county rejected
Bunker's argument, Orange County plunged itself into bankruptcy, and
a federal judge froze all outstanding property tax appeals. In the
year before the bankruptcy, the county Assessment Appeals Board had
amassed a backlog of 62,000 review requests -- including Bank of
America and other big companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bunker's lawsuit alleges that, at the time of the bankruptcy,
4,000 pending appeals had slipped beyond the two-year deadline, and
that 1,500 subsequently suffered the same fate as his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   A 1998 lawsuit was thrown out by a judge, but an appellate court
just ruled that Bunker has a legitimate complaint and that the case
should be tried in Orange County Superior Court. So stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   The county maintains it has procedures in place to avoid missing
deadlines. But Bunker's battle should be of broader interest because
it underscores the need for property owners to challenge assessments
that seem at odds with reality.</TE>
<TE>   The Bunker case might not qualify as taxation without
representation, but it's clearly taxation with misrepresentation. And
cheers to Bunker for not giving up his fight.</TE>

<HD>Noise Rule Is Unsound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana officials are a bit abashed about the ordinance that, along
with a tree, fell on a Floral Park house last week.</LD>
<LD>   A dose of common sense would help the players in this classic tale
of well-intentioned people, crossed signals and small lapses that led
to a nonsensical Veterans Day standoff.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana has a reasonable ordinance that outlaws construction
noise on weekends and federal holidays. An attempt to give working
folks a quiet day at the castle.</LD>
<TE>   But this past Veterans Day in picturesque Floral Park was less
than peaceful. A resident called to complain about the noise from two
houses where repair work was underway. Police stopped the work. Then
they heard noise down the street, where tree trimmers were sawing
into pieces a Chinese elm that had fallen against a house during the
recent storm and blocked the front door.</TE>
<TE>   Well, police thought, noise is noise.</TE>
<TE>   Being reasonable, they let the trimmers clear a path to the door.
But then, despite the uprooted tree leaning against the house, and
the difficulty of finding tree trimmers after a damaging storm, the
work had to stop. Police praise themselves for not issuing a
citation.</TE>
<TE>   There's a big difference between emergency work and noisy
construction scheduled for a day when neighbors should be able to
barbecue in peace. But somehow no one in the city thought of this
before Veterans Day.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana's little-known and poorly written ordinance needs a
little repair work itself (not on a holiday, though). Urgent
situations clearly override the neighborhood's desire for quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Should a major sewer break or broken water main befall Santa Ana
on a holiday, would the city obey its own ordinance and refrain from
fixing the problem?</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, City Manager David N. Ream said he would look into
the law immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Police also could have stretched their good intentions a little
further. Drivers aren't allowed to speed, but if a motorist is
pressing the gas pedal to get a seriously ill person to an emergency
room, the police provide an escort, not a ticket. Good judgment is as
important as the letter of the law. Officers could even have gone to
the complaining neighbor and explained the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Or here's a solution that, sadly, few people think of these days.
Imagine if the neighbor had gone to the owners of the noisy houses to
ask that they refrain on this holiday -- a day of respect for people
who have served our country.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that the noise-makers were considerate enough to apologize
and quit. If the neighbor went to the tree trimmers, they could
explain the situation and the neighbor would understand. A situation
handled with common sense among reasonable people without police
intervention.</TE>
<TE>   Just a holiday thought.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thank you for such great coverage of Proposition 51 and its
relationship to the Great Park. As a member of the Planning and
Conservation League, which sponsored the bond measure, and a
supporter of the Great Park, I was disappointed in the approach.</LD>
<LD>   Though Proposition 51 was progressive in a lot of ways, it was
also self-serving and fraught with tunnel vision. It alienated some
of its most ardent supporters and failed to make a distinction
between urgent and important issues.</LD>
<LD>   The backers of Proposition 51 were absolutely correct when they
said that Orange County is a donor county and that we do not get our
fair share of taxes invested back into our communities. However, the
way Proposition 51 was written and marketed, one would think that
Irvine is the only city in Orange County. The argument that Orange
County is a donor county, and thus we need a park in Irvine, missed
the fact that there are a lot of urgent land-use issues in Orange
County.</LD>
<TE>   Though the Great Park is important and will be great for Orange
County, it is not urgent. The park can be built in 10, 20 or 25
years.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, there are many urgent land-use issues involving areas
such as Coyote Hills in Fullerton, the Brea hills wildlife corridor,
the headlands in Dana Point, Marblehead in San Clemente, Banning
Ranch in Newport Beach, and Saddleback Meadows and the Rancho Mission
Viejo property in southern Orange County. All of these beautiful
areas face imminent destruction and are important to nearby
communities. They are in urgent need of help.</TE>
<TE>   People will pass land acquisition bonds to buy land or restore
land communities. Even Proposition 40 passed in Orange County with a
majority. If only half of the money slated for the Great Park were to
be allocated to other areas in Orange County that demonstrated a
"willing seller," it would have had more supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51 failed to identify important land-use issues in
Orange County and elsewhere in the state. Irvine saying that it was
the only area worthy of parks was not helpful. We all lost because of
that failed strategy.</TE>

such as La Habra and San Clemente. It could even have impacts from
San Ysidro to Crescent City. I am not talking jets, either. I am
talking about the threat to taxpayers around the state from Irvine
Mayor Larry Agran's avarice.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, he failed with Proposition 51 in an attempt to raid
the state general fund to the tune of $120 million for his "tax-free"
Great Park. He was barely reelected, as more than 46% of his own city
voted for a virtually unknown opponent. Probably the only thing that
saved Agran's political career was that a lot of Democrats and
left-leaning independents couldn't quite bring themselves to vote for
a Republican opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, you can bet your bottom dollar that Agran will try
again some way, somehow to grab a fistful of tax dollars for his
fantasy park. Look for another Proposition 51-style measure that
diverts general funds or a bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   We need to protect ourselves from this new threat that El Toro
poses. The Board of Supervisors should place a measure on the ballot
that would make it illegal to use any bond or state general funds for
El Toro regardless of its zoning. Since Measure W promised "no new
taxes," it should then be legally enforced. Otherwise, it will be the
Great Park greed that will ultimately lead to the unraveling of
Measure W. Agran and other parasitic politicians should quit while
they're still ahead.</TE>

<TE>   Linda Hoover of Lake Forest (Letters, Nov. 10) complains that
Measure W passed only because North County had a low voter turnout
and South County voters were "frightened out of their wits by
misleading airport propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   The existence of an international airport in South County would
have no negative impact on North County. This explains the low voter
turnout there.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, South County residents did not need to listen to or
read any anti-airport propaganda. We were convinced by the sounds of
the occasional military jets flying over our houses. We knew that an
international airport would turn those occasional flights into
24-hour, nonstop air traffic flying over our homes, neighborhoods and
schools. That is why we came out in full force. The result was as it
should be. Those of us who would experience all of the negative
effects were the ones to give a resounding "no."</TE>

<LD>Re "Saddleback OKd for Development," Nov. 6:</LD>
<LD>   When will we stop developing the precious little land that
remains? There comes a point when development of land (yes, even
private land) is a crime against the environment.</LD>
<LD>   Even small developments within a wildlife corridor cause
significant habitat damage. And what about the first time a coyote
kills a pet? There will be outrage and a demand for the removal of
the very wildlife that the people sought out before they moved there.
What starts out as a small development becomes a large one. Humans
cannot live in harmony with nature. When man and nature interact,
nature suffers the most apparent damage. But it is we who suffer the
most in the long run. It's time to let the wild areas remain wild and
for us to use our intelligence to determine how to live within the
current infrastructure.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, the Orange County Board of Supervisors delivered
unincorporated Trabuco Canyon another unneeded and unwanted
mass-graded development for hundreds of tract homes. Named by the
developers Saddleback Meadows but more aptly described as Where the
Saddleback Meadows Used to Be, the project sits in the foothills of
the Santa Ana Mountains at the uppermost reaches of the Aliso Creek
watershed, between the Ramakrishna Monastery and St. Michael's Abbey.</TE>
<TE>   The project requires amendment of the Foothill/Trabuco Specific
Plan, enacted in 1991 by a more visionary Board of Supervisors, to
preserve the area's rural character and provide a buffer between
urban development and the Cleveland National Forest. Saddleback
Meadows goes precisely in the opposite direction.</TE>
<TE>   The current board's approval of this project entirely disrespects
the Specific Plan and is yet another example of our county's
insatiable desire to pave over even the most bucolic and
resource-rich locales. Casting the lone dissenting vote, at least
Supervisor Tom Wilson had the courage and foresight to say no to this
development, citing urban runoff and other environmental issues.
Maybe it's because the development will contribute to more
contaminated beaches in the cities in his district, and he'll be
around to have to answer for it.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Spitzer, on the other hand, snubbed his district, choosing
instead to sympathize with the shortsighted, profit-oriented goals of
the developer. Maybe he feels distanced from the importance of
preserving Trabuco Canyon now that he's on to "more important" issues
in Sacramento. But, having brushed aside the pleas of his
constituents, including two religious groups and the federal and
state wildlife agencies who say the development will destroy a
crucial wildlife corridor, one has to be concerned about what Todd
Spitzer will do representing his constituents at the state level.</TE>

<HD>Adams Case Shows the Need for Bar Evaluation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that judicial candidate John Adams has been revealed as a
ne'er-do-well businessman with minimal if any legal experience
masquerading as an experienced lawyer, those duped into endorsing him
should commit that the next time they endorse a judicial candidate,
they will require the candidate to agree to be evaluated by the
Orange County Bar Assn.'s judicial evaluations committee.</LD>
<LD>   The bar committee uses a three-person team of respected
litigators, each with at least 10 years' experience, to interview the
candidate, his former opposing counsel, judges before whom he or she
has appeared, and other references, which the candidate is required
to identify on a comprehensive questionnaire.</LD>
<LD>   The investigative team reports its findings to the committee,
which numbers 20 to 30 lawyers. They sometimes require further
investigation. The investigators include prosecutors, criminal
defense lawyers, and civil lawyers from both the plaintiff's and
defense bar.</LD>
<TE>   Mistakes do happen. Persons with private maladies can sneak
through the system. But by and large the system works well. The
system only comes into play, however, when the candidate agrees to be
evaluated. Adams refused to be evaluated. Now we know why. Adams knew
his checkered past could not withstand the scrutiny of his peers.</TE>

<LD>Re "Phones Blamed in More Crashes," Nov. 10:</LD>

<TE>   In your article on the relationship between the use of cell phones
and car accidents, you neglected to mention an important study
(reported by The Times not too long ago) that showed that the
distraction responsible for the accidents is caused not so much by
the act of holding the phone as by the mere fact that the driver's
attention is engaged in conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, hands-free phone regulation may not remedy the
situation entirely, although it seems certainly a step in the right
direction.</TE>

<LD>Re "Issa's Project Shouldn't Sidestep Federal Review," Nov. 10:</LD>
<LD>   Writer Paul Carlton misleads readers on several points related to
the proposed Lake Elsinore Advanced Pump Storage facility and
legislation I introduced providing for a route for a transmission
line to connect that project to California's electricity transmission
grid.</LD>
<LD>   When the project is completed, it will provide much-needed clean
hydro-electric energy to Southern California. The federal government
already owns most of the land necessary for the project, and contrary
to Carlton's claims, no wilderness areas will be affected.</LD>
<TE>   With respect to the needed transmission line, any proposed route
will have to undergo the environmental review process outlined in the
National Environmental Protection Act. The legislation I have written
would begin that process in the hopes of providing an emission-free
energy solution to meet California's future energy challenges.</TE>

<LD>   As a teacher at North Orange County Regional Occupational Program,

<LD>   The blame, however, falls as much on the schools as the students.
Many teachers tend to look the other way because detecting and
preventing cheating takes too much effort and decreases pass rates.</LD>
<TE>   And if teachers do try to stop it, they get little or no support
from the administration. The administrators are more interested in
funding tied to average daily attendance than in the integrity of the
program or the quality of the product.</TE>

<LD>Re "Neuroscientists Mine the Depths of Emotions," Nov. 8:</LD>
<LD>   I must express my apprehension of our current research in the
field of human behavior. The article speaks of researchers who are
trying to record emotions and brain activity, an area they say is
hitherto unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Interesting that more "science" in this field has led to a
voluminous amount of "disorders," which in turn has resulted in a
corresponding list of "behavioral" drugs to alter people. We can see
plainly the disastrous effects this has created, with the escalation
of violence and mental institutions, including a large portion of the
population of our children, like we have never seen before.</LD>
<TE>   If the golden rule and decent social mores have influenced the
"anatomy of social graces, neural impulses of fairness and shame" in
the past, maybe it's time to reemphasize that workable formula. At
least people would have the choice with their own behavior, rather
than having some know-best scientist push buttons to adjust our
emotions.</TE>

<LD>Re "Playing Population-Explosion Politics," Nov. 5:</LD>
<LD>   Robert Scheer's gloom-and-doom diatribe against the U.S. religious
right, repressive Muslim regimes and the Vatican is utter nonsense,
for the simple and obvious reason that the world's population is not
exploding. According to World Population Prospects: The 2000 Revision
(United Nations publication, 2001), world births have declined since
1985-1990, and world population will, with a high degree of
confidence, begin to decline in about one generation. The world will
then be faced with very different and far more severe calamities than
the "chaos -- desperate mass migrations -- medical epidemics, bloody
riots and crime waves" mentioned by Scheer.</LD>
<LD>   Such will be the tragic legacy of the immoral United Nations
programs championed by Scheer to "empower women by giving them
reproductive rights." These international programs which promote
almost exclusively sterilization, abortifacient contraception and
abortion have already produced disastrous results in the more
developed regions of the world. During the last 25 years the total
fertility (average number of children per woman) of these regions has
sunk to suicidal levels.</LD>

housing, many working poor, overburdened medical and criminal justice
systems, shortages of water and power and impacts on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   This rate of growth, and its fallout, was the "given," and all
articles discussed how best to deal with these problems.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere have I seen a discussion of the root cause of our problems
-- too much immigration and the high birthrates of some of our
immigrant groups. A quick look at the Census 2000 statistics from the
U.S. Census Bureau reveals that during the 10 years between 1990 and
2000, the population of California increased by about 4 million
people, a gain of about 5 million minorities and a loss of about 1
million non-Hispanic whites. The 5 million-person gain in minorities
included an increase of about 1 million Asians and more than 3
million Hispanics.</TE>
<TE>   So if we truly want to address the problems of overpopulation and
demographic rate of change then we must, as a minimum, regain control
of our borders.</TE>

<LD>During the debate between the Cypress City Council and Cottonwood
Christian Church, ultraconservatives (such as radio talk show hosts
Larry Elder and Hugh Hewitt) kept saying that the council was not
representing the will of the people.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, those of us who fully supported the council felt
otherwise. And we were right, because on election day, all three
incumbents were reelected.</LD>
<LD>   After viewing the actions of the church during this ordeal (they
bused people to council meetings who would stand outside screaming
that anyone who didn't support the church was the devil and would rot
in hell), it is my hope that this kind of church never be built.</LD>

<LD>Re "Sports Agent Tackles Ex-Protege in Court," Oct. 22:</LD>
<LD>   After reading a number of articles about Leigh Steinberg and the
unfortunate trial in which he is embroiled, it is important to
examine another side of this very unselfish super sports agent.</LD>
<LD>   The Anti-Defamation League of Orange County and Long Beach is a
vibrant and important agency in our community today because of
Steinberg's vision. He saw the need to train and develop vigorous and
motivated individuals to pick up the mantle of leadership so the ADL
can continue its important work. Fighting hate, bigotry and
prejudice, especially in today's world, is a priority of our
community. ADL takes the lead in this fight and Steinberg's support
makes it possible. It's time to remember the legacy Steinberg gives
to each athlete he represents: that they give back to their community
and make the world a better place. His former clients need to
remember how they benefited from Steinberg in more ways than one.</LD>

<HD>Myra Hindley, 60; Accomplice in Grisly U.K. Child Killings
in '60s</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Myra Hindley, one of Britain's most hated women for her involvement
in a string of child killings in the 1960s that gave her the nickname
the "Moors Murderer," died Friday. She was 60.</LD>
<LD>   Hindley, who smoked 40 cigarettes a day, died of respiratory
failure at West Suffolk hospital in Bury St. Edmunds in eastern
England, Britain's Prison Service said. She had been taken to the
hospital from her cell in Highpoint Prison in Suffolk on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Britain's longest-serving female prisoner suffered from heart
disease, high blood pressure and osteoporosis. In the last two years
she had apparently suffered at least one stroke and heart attack.</LD>
<TE>   In 1966, in a trial that riveted Britain, Hindley and her
boyfriend, Ian Brady, were sentenced to life in prison for the
murders of 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey and 17-year-old Edward
Evans.</TE>
<TE>   Brady was also found guilty of killing John Kilbride, 12, and
Hindley was convicted of sheltering her lover after that murder. The
pair confessed in 1987 to murdering Pauline Reade, 16, and Keith
Bennett, 12. They were not tried for those deaths. Bennett's body has
never been found.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Hindley said in letters to a journalist that she
wished she had been hanged. Nevertheless, she had campaigned steadily
for her freedom, claiming she was driven to participate in the
killings by Brady, who was said to be fascinated by Nazi killings and
death. Brady, who earlier unsuccessfully sought to be allowed to end
his life, remains in prison and is force-fed since going on a hunger
strike in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the young victims were beaten, tortured and sexually
abused before being killed and buried on a desolate moor in
northwestern England.</TE>
<TE>   The couple tape-recorded their crimes. Detectives said they would
never forget hearing Lesley Ann Downey pleading for mercy as the pair
killed her or the tune of the "Little Drummer Boy" the couple played
as they carried out the murders.</TE>
<TE>   The serial killings, from July 1963 to October 1965, horrified
Britain. The victims simply vanished -- Reade was abducted on her way
to a disco, and Downey, the pair's youngest victim, was lured from a
fairground. Hindley always claimed that her role was to abduct the
children and that she did not take part in the killings or sex
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hindley was 18 and Brady 22 when they met as clerical co-workers
for a chemicals firm in Manchester, England. Within a year, they
became lovers. Hindley said he dominated her by beating and
blackmailing her and threatening to kill her relatives. Before the
murder spree, she said, he forced her to buy books for him about the
Marquis de Sade.</TE>
<TE>   Hindley became a hated figure for Britain's tabloid newspapers,
which splashed her glowering mug shot on front pages every time she
came up for parole. Her gender seemed to make her even more of a
target, with many expressing shock that a woman could be involved in
such grisly violence against children.</TE>
<TE>   The murder of Lesley Ann Downey was perhaps the pair's most
notorious.</TE>
<TE>   Hindley lured the 10-year-old away from a fairground the day after
Christmas 1964. The girl was sexually abused, tortured and forced to
pose for pornographic photos. Jurors in the trial listened to the
audiotape of the girl calling out for her mother and asking God to
help her, before she was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Hindley and Brady were caught in 1965, after they forced Hindley's
brother-in-law, David Smith, to watch as they killed Evans. Smith
fled and called the police.</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge, Fenton Atkinson, said more of the blame lay with
Brady than Hindley. "Though I believe that Brady is wicked beyond
belief without hope of redemption, I cannot feel the same is
necessarily true of Hindley, once she is removed from his influence,"
Atkinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Hindley, who became a devout Roman Catholic and received a
humanities degree while in prison, admitted that "my conscience will
follow me to my dying day." But she insisted that she had paid her
debt to society and yearned to be released. "I know I could be out
one week before someone assassinated me," she said. "But at least I
would have had a week of freedom."</TE>

<HD>Mustafa Mashhour, 81; Leader of Banned Muslim Group in
Egypt</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Mustafa Mashhour, 81, a leader of Egypt's banned Muslim Brotherhood
who spent more than 20 years in jail, died Thursday in Egypt after
suffering a stroke and going into a coma Oct. 29.</LD>
<LD>   The Brotherhood, founded in 1928, advocates turning Egypt into a
strict Islamic state. Although once known for violence, it says it
now seeks change only through peaceful means within the political
process.</LD>
<LD>   Born in a village in Sharkiya province, Mashhour joined the group
in 1938 when he was 17. He received a bachelor's degree in science in
1943 and worked for the Egyptian government's Meteorological
Department. In 1948, he was sentenced to three years in jail after
police seized guns allegedly belonging to the Brotherhood.</LD>
<TE>   In 1954, after the group was blamed for a failed attempt on the
life of President Gamal Abdel-Nasser, Egypt outlawed the organization
and jailed or executed scores of its leaders. Mashhour was sentenced
to 10 years in prison. He was arrested again in 1965 and held without
charges until President Anwar Sadat pardoned political prisoners in
1971.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur T. Winfree, 60, who was known for his studies of biological
rhythms -- work that affected research in heart rhythms, arrhythmia
and sleep patterns -- died of cancer Nov. 5 at his home in Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   Winfree, a University of Arizona professor of ecology and
evolutionary biology, helped develop an understanding of how the
human biological clock could be synchronized and slightly reset, an
idea that led to his designing a program by which travelers might
avoid jet lag.</LD>
<LD>   But Winfree, who was known for his modesty, also recognized that
"other factors, such as auto suggestion, might explain equally well
his irritability and sleeplessness when he didn't follow his own
recipe," said Richard Michod, head of the University of Arizona
department in which Winfree taught.</LD>
<TE>   Winfree, who received a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur
fellowship in 1984 (an award also won by his son, Erik, an assistant
professor of computer science at Caltech, in 2000), earned his
bachelor's degree from Cornell University and his doctorate from
Princeton.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Ji-Yun; a daughter, Rae, who teaches
at Princeton; his son; his father, C. Van Winfree; a sister; and two
brothers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry May, 81, an Emmy-nominated scenic designer for stage and
television who collaborated with such well-known artists as Frank
Lloyd Wright, Orson Welles and Leonard Bernstein, died Monday in a
Washington, D.C., nursing home.</LD>
<LD>   He had Alzheimer's disease, according to UC Berkeley, where he
taught for many years.</LD>
<LD>   May's sets were known for their clean style, symmetry and detail.
He worked at such venues as Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and the New
England Conservatory of Music. He also designed major theater and
dance productions at UC Berkeley for 25 years, until his retirement
in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Havana and raised in New York City, he earned a bachelor's
degree in landscape architecture in 1943 from the University of
Illinois. After a roommate introduced him to theater, he began
designing productions for the university and summer stock.</TE>
<TE>   After serving in the Navy during World War II, he studied set
design at Yale University.</TE>
<TE>   He was nominated for an Emmy in 1957 for his artistic direction of
"Boswell's Life of Johnson" on the variety show "Omnibus."</TE>
<TE>   He also won a bronze medal at the Sixth Triennale of Theater Set
and Costume Design in Yugoslavia in 1981 for his production of
Shakespeare's "As You Like It." His other honors included a
Guggenheim Foundation Award and a West Coast Theater Critic's Award
for his design work on Noel Coward's "Tonight at 8:30."</TE>

<HD>Alan Tagg, 74; Set Designer Known for Eye for Detail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Tagg, a prominent British theater set designer whose best-known
work included the shabby bed-sitting room in the original 1956 Royal
Court Theatre production of John Osborne's "Look Back in Anger," has
died. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Tagg, whose nearly four-decade career spanned London's West End
and Broadway, died of undisclosed causes Nov. 4 in a London nursing
home. He had been in frail health.</LD>
<LD>   Known as a designer with an eye for detail, Tagg designed sets for
the National Theatre, the Chichester Festival, the Royal Shakespeare
Company and many of Alan Ayckbourn's West End plays -- including
Ayckbourn's 1970 "How the Other Half Loves," in which a single living
room doubled for the upscale and downscale couples (a transformation
made by changing the cushions on the sofa).</LD>
<TE>   Tagg's credo for theatrical decor was that it should never draw
attention to itself: Scenery should serve the play with a minimum of
distraction, "just as long as the actors don't bump into it."</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't quite the case with Tagg's set for Osborne's "Look
Back in Anger," which was so realistically cluttered with household
items that the actors found it difficult to move without running into
the bed, the ironing board and other set decorations.</TE>
<TE>   Tagg also did the sets for Osborne's 1957 play "The Entertainer,"
starring Laurence Olivier, which moved on to the West End.</TE>
<TE>   Among his other Royal Court sets were the slum interiors for John
Arden's 1958 "Live Like Pigs" and the sparsely furnished jungle hut
for Willis Hall's 1959 play about Japanese prisoners of war, "The
Long and the Short and the Tall."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first designers to devise scenery for amphitheaters,
Tagg achieved one of his biggest successes with a 1965 production of
Arthur Wing Pinero's "Trelawney of the Wells" at Chichester.</TE>
<TE>   With no drop curtain to hide a major scene change, Tagg had
Victorian footmen in shirt sleeves calmly remove tables and chairs,
roll up the carpet and lower a chandelier, turning the modest
lodgings into an upscale house.</TE>
<TE>   The enthralled audience responded to the transformation with
applause.</TE>
<TE>   Tagg's decor for Ayckbourn's "Way Upstream" for the National
Theatre in 1982 was more problematic: It included a large water tank,
whose erection and dismantling sometimes caused it to leak.</TE>
<TE>   He was nominated for a London Theatre Critics Award for his work
on the Royal Shakespeare Company's acclaimed 1970 revival of Dion
Boucicault's "London Assurance."</TE>
<TE>   The shy, mild-mannered Tagg was considered the designer of choice
for stars such as Ingrid Bergman, Deborah Kerr and Maggie Smith.</TE>
<TE>   His designs for Broadway included Peter Shaffer's 1966 "Black
Comedy," for which Tagg received a Tony nomination when it was
transferred to Broadway; and the 1990 "Lettice and Lovage."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Sutton-in-Ashfield in central England in 1928, Tagg
studied at Mansfield College of Art and then trained at the Old Vic
Theatre School, directed by George Devine and Michel St.-Denis.</TE>
<TE>   Tagg, who joined other former students in founding Devine's Royal
Court Company, began his career as a designer in 1952 in the West End
production of Charles Morgan's "The River Line," directed by Michael
MacOwan.</TE>
<TE>   Tagg is survived by his longtime partner and a brother.</TE>

<HD>We Have the Resources to End Hunger</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Seeberg</AU>
<BD>Tom Seeberg is director of Second Harvest Food Bank of
Orange County</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We have a problem in Orange County. It's one that can be solved. The
question is, what are we going to do about it?</LD>
<LD>   It isn't new, but most of us turn our heads in disbelief when we
hear about it. How can we have people going hungry in one of the most
affluent communities in the country?</LD>
<LD>   The late psychologist Abraham Maslow, who created the now-famous
"Hierarchy of Needs," ranked hunger in the bedrock of a five-tier
pyramid that includes physiological needs, safety needs, belonging
needs, esteem needs and self-actualization.</LD>
<TE>   Hunger has no face, at least not one you could pick out of a
crowd, yet it's a major problem. It continues to grow in record
proportions. The usual perception of the hungry in many people's
minds is a population of illegal immigrants or people too lazy to
work. That's simply not the case.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, we're talking about the working poor. They have
jobs that pay minimal wages. They are probably living in apartments
or homes, but the rent or mortgage expenses are almost prohibitive.
So we do have neighbors who are at risk of missing meals sometime
each month.</TE>
<TE>   This is where Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County enters the
picture. The food bank helps to provide nutritious food through 386
local member charities.</TE>
<TE>   For the statistically inclined, the 2000 Census estimated that
450,000 people in Orange County, roughly 16% of the overall
population, falls into this category. And more than 40% of those
going hungry are children.</TE>
<TE>   According to county surveys of shelters and agencies that assist
the needy, 23,000 people have no home to sleep in each night in this
relatively wealthy community of ours. That number has grown by 17%
from a year ago and up more than 100% over the past five years.</TE>
<TE>   The tragedy of Sept. 11 compounded the problem. Since then, the
unemployment rate has climbed from 4.9% to 5.9%. Thirty-three states
reported massive layoffs as a result of the attacks. A total of 56%
of those cuts came from five states -- including California.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these alarming figures, our society still places a higher
priority on tourism, building performing art centers, restoring
historic buildings, projects that have an impact on traffic and the
like. But when it comes to one of our most basic needs -- food -- we
often turn a blind eye.</TE>
<TE>   Working in an outdated facility and in dire need of a larger site,
the food bank nonetheless managed to set a record by distributing
more than 15 million pounds of food during our 2001-02 fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   While the figures may sound impressive, we are still unable to
meet the needs of even half of the at-risk population. At the same
time, an estimated 2.5 million pounds of food are wasted every month
in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   What does all this mean? As the holiday season begins, wouldn't it
be wonderful if each of us refocused our priorities to include
digging in and doing something about our backyard problem?</TE>
<TE>   How can you help?</TE>
<TE>   The answers are simple.</TE>
<TE>   Donate food.</TE>
<TE>   Donate money.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer. Call (714) 771-1343, e-mail give@FeedOC.org or visit
www.FeedOC.org to learn more.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating hunger in Orange County is possible, but only if each
of us accepts the challenge and makes it a priority.</TE>

<HD>Yogi Helps Explain Why the Democrats Struck Out</HD>
<DH>In light of the election day results, will the party
change? Yes! It will go further to the left.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Royalty</AU>
<BD>Reed Royalty is president of the Orange County
Taxpayers Assn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Taxpayers Assn. turned to the wisdom of Yogi Berra
to help us assess the election. Here are Mr. Berra's comments,
followed by OCTax's interpretation of what he said.</LD>
<LD>   "We made too many wrong mistakes."</LD>
<LD>   Democrats think they lost the nationwide election because "our
message was not clear; people didn't know what we stood for."
Actually, their message was as clear as a buttonhook in the well
water. Today's Democrats stand for higher taxes, bigger government
programs and pandering to unions that represent government employees.
That message was welcome in California, but not anywhere else.</LD>
<TE>   In light of the election day results, will the party change? Yes!
It will go further to the left. Nancy Pelosi, described in the Los
Angeles Times as "to the left of Richard Gephardt," has become House
minority leader.</TE>
<TE>   At the state level, the Senate has created a committee to end
poverty by finding ways to end "greed" through the redistribution of
wealth from the rich to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's founder proudly cited socialist Upton Sinclair,
who ran for governor in the 1930s on a platform of creating communes
in California. Republicans must be jubilant.</TE>
<TE>   "The other teams could make trouble for us if they win."</TE>
<TE>   The San Andreas Fault, which runs north-south near the coast,
divides California geophysically. Politically too. Most liberals live
near, or west of, the San Andreas Fault: Los Angeles, Monterey, San
Francisco, Berkeley, Marin County. Anti-tax working stiffs live east
of the fault, in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Orange County is west of the fault. But the Newport-Inglewood
Fault juts from the San Andreas to encompass us among the
conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   When the Big Quake sloughs the entire coastline into the ocean,
California's political landscape will change as much as its
topography.</TE>
<TE>   But the part of the state that remains will have to decide whether
to grant amnesty to the tax-and-spenders that survive the quake and
bob back ashore in their hot tubs.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of the game is half mental."</TE>
<TE>   Common sense made a slight comeback this year, even in areas where
voters normally are guided by metaphysical cosmic emanations rather
than taxpayers' judgment.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco voters passed an initiative that will reduce checks
to the homeless and shift the funds to programs to rehabilitate them.
In addition, Baghdad by the Bay rejected ballot measures that would
have created a government electricity authority and raised property
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were overwhelming underdogs."</TE>
<TE>   Because California is more liberal than the nation, pundits fear
we will be ignored by the conservative White House and Congress in
the distribution of federal largess.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry. As a de facto socialist nation, ruled by an
avaricious dictator who the polls say is disliked by 60% of his own
people, all California needs to do is establish a consulate, exchange
ambassadors with the United States, promise to reform our government
and apply for foreign aid.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lost, but we're making good time."</TE>
<TE>   With a state deficit of $24 billion, there won't be money for
state legislators and the governor to spend. Will they sit there and
do nothing? No. They'll do "free" things for us. They will impose
unfunded mandates on local governments, business and labor.</TE>
<TE>   A legislator told OCTax that "the state must force local
governments to do needed things that are politically unpopular." We
can expect a Santa's bag of "free" help from Sacramento mandating
affordable housing, employee benefits, affirmative action, universal
health care and other utopian ideals.</TE>
<TE>   "The future ain't what it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   An issue in future elections will be the surging AIDS epidemic in
India, China and Russia. The disease may kill 43 million people in
those nations by 2025. Eurasia holds 63% of the world's population
and is very visible.</TE>
<TE>   We will see people dying on television. To what extent will U.S.
taxpayers be willing or able to stop the human and economic
destruction caused by AIDS?</TE>
<TE>   "If people don't want to come to the ballpark, how are you going
to stop them?"</TE>
<TE>   This election drew the lowest voter turnout in history.</TE>
<TE>   Why bother?</TE>
<TE>   Last year's legislative redistricting was designed by incumbents
to protect incumbents. Of the 153 state and federal races on the
ballot in California this year, only five were subject to real
competition between the parties. This discourages voter
participation. It's boring. It gives credence to the old lament that
"one vote doesn't count." It makes it difficult for voters to hold
their representatives accountable at the next election.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of decades ago, the Supreme Court appointed a panel of
"masters" (retired justices) to redistrict the state, because the
Legislature couldn't agree on a plan.</TE>
<TE>   Yogi Berra might agree that it's time to reappoint the masters.
Give us "deja vu all over again."</TE>

<HD>Man Is Jailed After 2 Fires</HD>
<DH>Police say blazes were set at a Buena Park bank and a
nightclub; 20-year-old is charged with attempted murder and arson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder and arson in
connection with two fires set early Saturday in Buena Park at a bank
and a nightclub he had been kicked out of a few hours earlier,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Molina Diaz Oliverio of Buena Park is being held at the city jail
on $1-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   Club staff members reported seeing a black truck leaving the area
after the fire started and spotted the vehicle again while
firefighters were extinguishing the blaze, Orange County Fire
Authority Capt. Stephen Miller said.</LD>
<TE>   Police stopped the truck and arrested Oliverio, who was wearing an
orange vest. Employees said he had been pepper-sprayed and thrown out
after trying to start a fight, Buena Park Police Lt. Terry Barnum
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had made a comment before he left that he was going to come
back and bomb the place," Barnum said. "It's probably not too smart
to do something like that when you're wearing a bright orange vest."</TE>
<TE>   The first fire was reported about 2:15 a.m. at a Bank of America
branch at Commonwealth Avenue and Beach Boulevard, where a blaze had
engulfed an ATM, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty minutes after firefighters had extinguished the bank fire,
they were called to Ozz, a dance club on Manchester Boulevard
one-third of a mile from the bank, where the facade and an exit door
were in flames, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   That fire was extinguished within minutes and caused an estimated
$5,000 damage. None of the four employees inside the closed club were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Oliverio was charged with attempted murder because of the fire's
location, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if his intent was to cause any harm," Miller said.
"However, the fire was started at an exit door, and that's where
employees need to come out."</TE>

<HD>Errant Cell Calls Are Clogging 911 System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a veteran 911 operator with the California Highway Patrol, Deanna
Mora has been trained to calm distraught murder witnesses, comfort
suicidal callers and make peace during angry domestic disputes.</LD>
<LD>   But she was not prepared for the call she received not long ago
from an upset woman who had just left a pet grooming salon in Orange
County. The woman's emergency? Her dog had just received a bad
haircut and she wanted the police to take some action.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half of the 7.2 million 911 calls made in California from
cellular phones last year were either not for emergencies -- of the
bad dog-haircut sort -- or accidental calls made when a cell phone
owner unintentionally dialed the emergency number.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is expected to grow with the proliferation of cell
phones. Of the 150 million 911 calls made nationwide in 2000, 45
million, or 30%, came from cell phones. This is a tenfold increase
from nearly 4.3 million wireless 911 calls just 10 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   By 2005, most 911 calls are expected to be from wireless callers.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials say there is no way to tell for certain
if the delays caused by bogus 911 calls have led to deaths or
injuries. But it is certain that such calls have clogged the system
and increased the frustration level among 911 operators.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone loves cell phones, but they can be a headache for us,"
said CHP Capt. Dan Hoff, commander of the Los Angeles communications
center, which fielded 1.8 million cellular 911 calls last year, more
than three times as many as in 1996. In California, the CHP takes
most 911 cellular calls. Hoff estimates that as many as 60% of those
calls are nonemergency or accidental calls.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to educate cell phone owners on the problem, the CHP for
the first time has joined with the Automobile Club of Southern
California to produce and air a television commercial warning that
accidental and bogus 911 calls can delay calls on truly
life-threatening emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   The new commercial, which is running for three weeks in Los
Angeles and San Diego counties, depicts a man who accidentally pushes
the 911 auto-dial feature on his cell phone while ordering coffee at
a coffee bar. Most cell phones are programmed to dial 911
automatically with the push of one button.</TE>
<TE>   In the commercial, the 911 operator assumes the man is reporting a
fire because she hears him yelling: "HOT! BURNING! FIRE!" In the ad,
the man is referring to the steaming cup of coffee he has just been
handed.</TE>
<TE>   To reduce the number of such calls, the CHP and the Auto Club urge
cell phone users to disable the single-button 911 feature. Cellular
industry leaders support the campaign, noting that most new phones
come with the feature already disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Many cellular carriers don't include a notice of 911 calls on
their bills, so callers usually don't know they have accidentally
called the emergency number.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, the problem is serious.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon at the Los Angeles communications center,
emergency operator Susana Carrillo, an 11-year veteran of the CHP,
responded to more than 10 accidental 911 calls in about an hour.</TE>
<TE>   In most of those calls, Carrillo heard nothing but dead air. In
others, she could hear music, the sounds of people walking down a
city street and people casually talking about lunch. She called out
in vain: "911 emergency. Hello?"</TE>
<TE>   In several calls, Carrillo could hear the bumping and scraping of
small items, which she guessed were the sounds picked up by a cell
phone inside a purse or backpack.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that she doesn't dismiss a true emergency, Carrillo is
required to listen for a few seconds. The CHP does not have the
technology to identify the location of a cellular 911 call. If a 911
operator is not sure whether a call is for a legitimate emergency,
the operator can call the cell phone back and ask if the caller meant
to dial 911. Usually, the embarrassed cell phone owner will
apologize, promising to be more careful in the future.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, Mora answered a 911 call that she assumed was a
legitimate emergency because she heard loud, angry voices in the
background. She called the cell phone back and learned that someone
had accidentally dialed 911 while watching a violent movie on
television.</TE>
<TE>   Mora said she once answered a 911 call, only to hear screaming
voices combined with the sounds of wheels speeding on a rail. Mora
called the cell phone back and learned that the caller had
accidentally bumped the phone while riding on a roller coaster.</TE>
<TE>   But accidental calls are only part of the problem. Many cell phone
owners have intentionally dialed 911 for the most inane reasons.</TE>
<TE>   They call to ask for the correct time. They want directions to a
restaurant or Disneyland. They want to know why traffic is moving so
slowly. Several 911 operators say they have received calls from men
who were stuck in traffic and wanted the CHP to call their wives to
explain that the men would be late for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials say such calls put an immense strain on an
already overburdened emergency communications system. The CHP
communications center in Los Angeles can accept only 50 cellular 911
calls at a time. Any calls beyond 50 must wait on hold.</TE>
<TE>   Several large cities, including Los Angeles, have launched 311
telephone systems that accept nonemergency calls, connecting callers
to dozens of public agencies. But no such number exists yet in
California for nonemergency cellular calls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great that they have that access to 911 with one button, but
it's giving us the blues," Hoff said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hello? Hello? What's the Emergency?</TE>
<TE>   Accidental and nonemergency calls account for nearly half of all
cellular 911 calls in the state, clogging the CHP emergency call
system and delaying response to real life-threatening emergencies.
The following are examples of cellular 911 calls made in Los Angeles
County on one day in October.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911. Do you have an emergency?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Yeah, I'm in a taxi, and the taxi driver is telling me he
is not taking me where I'm supposed to go, and he is going to take me
back where he picked me up from.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: Unfortunately, sir, that is not a life-threatening
emergency. Is he threatening you in any way?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Yeah. He is taking me back out of my way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911. Hello. Hello?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Hello.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: Oh, hello. This is 911.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Hello.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: This is 911. Did you have an emergency?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Oh, I'm sorry, I must have sat on my phone. Sorry to
bother you.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: Don't sit on your phone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Can I ask you one question? There is nothing going on. I
just want to ask you one question. I lost my wallet on the bus and I
have the feeling that the bus driver took it because I'm sure it was
in the bus. And I was asking the bus driver if he can possibly, like,
let me see his bag just to make sure he didn't take it. I know it's
rude but ... I was 90% sure that he can be the only person who took
it.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: What you have to do is call the bus company and talk to
them.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: But they can't do anything.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: I beg your pardon.</TE>
<TE>   Caller: They can't do anything.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: Who can't do anything?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: My question is....</TE>
<TE>   Operator: I'm telling you to call the bus company and talk to
them. You are tying up my 911 line.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911 emergency. What are you reporting?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Yeah, can you have a patrol car come to the El Segundo
(park) on Imperial Highway at the doggie park. They have the small
dogs in with the big dogs, and there is a problem.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Operator: 911 emergency. What are you reporting?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Yes, I'm calling to report a missing street in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Operator: A missing street?</TE>
<TE>   Caller: Yes, I couldn't find Evergreen Street in L.A. from the
1000 block to 700. It's missing. It's really missing. I looked on the
map and drove around, and I couldn't find it.</TE>

<HD>Few Bumps Found on Caltrans' Path</HD>
<DH>Agency generally gets good marks. But engineers say turning
over projects to private sector is a mistake.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If construction defects discovered in a new carpool ramp linking the
Costa Mesa and San Diego freeways turn into a major headache for
Caltrans, it won't be the first in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The California Department of Transportation has been stung by a
handful of construction problems and delays in Southern California,
including design flaws in the Century Freeway that cost taxpayers an
extra $60 million and faulty welds at the Orange Crush interchange,
where the Santa Ana, Orange and Garden Grove freeways merge.</LD>
<LD>   Critics contend that agency's oversight has faltered, in part
because Caltrans has had difficulty filling key vacancies. However,
even they acknowledge the agency has suffered relatively few mishaps
among the hundreds of projects it handles annually.</LD>
<TE>   In August, state auditors faulted Caltrans for a yearlong delay
and $321,000 cost overrun on the Highway 33 improvement project in
Ventura County, blaming the problems on the agency's failure to
monitor the contractor and for using faulty designs.</TE>
<TE>   However, auditors reviewed 20 other projects in Caltrans'
$4-billion-a-year highway maintenance and construction program, and
generally gave the agency good marks for staying within budget and
avoiding unreasonable delays.</TE>
<TE>   "The California Department of Transportation has the best
transportation work force anywhere," Caltrans Director Jeff Morales
said. "We are currently managing more than 650 construction projects
worth $7 billion."</TE>
<TE>   Morales said local and county transportation agencies often seek
out Caltrans to manage their road and highway projects.</TE>
<TE>   "While we won't be error-free, our work force is trained and
qualified to address any issues or problems we face," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials say their leadership should be judged on its
current performance -- not on blunders that happened under previous
administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of the agency's most vocal critics agree.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, given the hundreds of projects Caltrans is managing
across the state, the vast majority of them have been very
successful," said Ted Toppin, spokesman for Professional Engineers in
California Government, which represents Caltrans engineers.</TE>
<TE>   However, Toppin and his organization have actively fought and
criticized the agency's practice of contracting with private firms to
manage, design and engineer some highway construction projects --
including the faulty carpool overpass between the Costa Mesa and San
Diego freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "When you turn over entire public works projects to the private
sector, there is no one there looking out for the public's interest,"
Toppin said. "They're looking to get the job done quickly, cheaply
and as simply as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Problems with other highway projects in recent years have
included:</TE>
<TE>   * Design flaws in a 3.5-mile lowered section of the Century
Freeway that was cracking and threatening to collapse because of
rising ground water. Caltrans spent $60 million to fix the road
linking Norwalk and Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   * Defective welds on a bridge between Interstates 805 and 8 in San
Diego County's Mission Valley area. In 1996, Caltrans ordered $44.3
million in earthquake retrofitting redone after tests showed problems
in nearly 70% of the welds in the bridge's reinforced columns.</TE>
<TE>   * Local politics, turf battles and legal scuffles have led to
delays and an estimated $1.3 billion in cost overruns in repairs of
earthquake damage to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), vice chairman of the
Senate Transportation Committee, said Caltrans has had serious
management problems since former Gov. Jerry Brown took office in the
early 1970s, when the agency started to give priority to public
transportation and other alternatives over the state highway system.</TE>

<HD>Calabasas Tries to Extend Itself for a Cantina</HD>
<DH>The city orders a study on ways to annex the Sagebrush in
Old Town. But L.A. officials aren't eager to part with the sales tax
gold mine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Calabasas City Council recently bellied up to the bar at the Old
West-style Sagebrush Cantina and placed its order: a $7,000 study on
how to lasso the tax-rich watering hole into the city limits.</LD>
<LD>   Not so fast, said the city of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The eatery with cowboy murals and sawdust-covered floors -- whose
patrons include such celebrities as Sophia Loren and Bruce
Springsteen -- is a sales tax gold mine worth fighting for, officials
say.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not foolish when it comes to giving up revenue," said Los
Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine, whose district includes the
1,000-seat restaurant. "This isn't a toxic dump that nobody wants;
this is a positive cash resource for our city."</TE>
<TE>   The councilman said he would view any boundary change as a
"business transaction" that would include a hefty price tag for
Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what amount of money would make for a fair trade, Zine
responded, only half joking, "maybe $50 million or $100 million."</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas, an upscale suburb whose residents enjoy hillside views
and oak-studded surroundings, knows it's in for a fight. By law, it
can't annex the seven-acre parcel, which extends like a thumb across
Mulholland Drive from Woodland Hills, without the permission of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas officials contend that money is not the driving factor.
They said the cantina and adjoining Leonis Adobe -- the birthplace of
their city -- are in Los Angeles only because of an accident of
history and should be restored to their proper home.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like manifest destiny to annex the property,"
Calabasas City Manager Don Duckworth said. "It doesn't make a lot of
sense that on one side of the street is Calabasas and the other side
is not."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, the cantina and adobe anchor Calabasas' Old Town, a
two-block stretch of quaint shops and offices connected by
cobblestone paving and plank sidewalks that serves as the social hub
of the 27,000-resident city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very strange border; it's a very silly border," Mayor
Lesley Devine said. "There is a table at the cantina where you and
your lunch partner can actually be sitting in two different cities."</TE>
<TE>   At least two other efforts to negotiate a deal with Los Angeles
failed in the 1990s because of disagreement over how to split sales
tax revenue from the cantina. Just how much tax money is at stake in
the latest effort is a matter of opinion. Officials of both cities
said there has been no recent analysis of the amount of annual
revenue generated by the cantina.</TE>
<TE>   A 1994 Los Angeles city report estimated that the restaurant
produced $150,000 annually in revenue for the city. A later report on
annexation, based on sales tax receipts, identified the cantina as
the second-busiest bar in Los Angeles County, behind Gladstone's 4
Fish in Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas officials hope the new annexation study will show that
the revenue Los Angeles collects from the Sagebrush Cantina is
largely offset by the expense of providing police, fire, street
maintenance and other services, Duckworth said. He believes the
$150,000 figure is far off the mark.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm suspicious of all numbers until we can figure this all out,"
Duckworth said. "I wouldn't deny at all that it is a significant
sales tax producer for Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   While the border feud continues, Sagebrush Cantina owner Bob
McCord III is staying out of the line of fire and says he'll be happy
with whoever wins.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, we're much more involved with the city of Calabasas
than we are with the city of L.A.," he said. "But I've been very
happy with Los Angeles for a lot of years."</TE>

<HD>L.A. Officers Fire Shots in Four Incidents</HD>
<DH>One man is killed, another wounded in spate of police
shootings. Two juveniles die after their fleeing car crashes into a
tree.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police officers fired their weapons at suspects in four
separate incidents Friday night and early Saturday. The incidents
left one man dead, another wounded and two juveniles dead after their
fleeing car crashed into a tree, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings, which are under routine investigation, occurred
over a nine-hour period and involved officers with at least five
years of experience. No officers were injured.</LD>
<LD>   In Wilmington, an unidentified man was shot and killed on a
cul-de-sac after he rammed his pickup truck into a police car several
times about 7 p.m. Friday, police said. The officers, who shielded
themselves behind the car's doors while they tried to get the man to
surrender, fired on the truck on Robidoux Street until it stopped.</LD>
<TE>   Police said officers had pursued the man after watching what they
believed was a drug buy. He died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   At 9 p.m., two Wilshire Division officers shot at a suspect
fleeing an apartment carport near Kingsley Drive and 5th Street where
a 59-year-old man had been shot. Officers said that while they were
arresting Jose Rivera, 26, on suspicion of attempted murder, they
heard another pair of shots from the carport and saw a man running.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said Armando Villatoro, 21, pointed a gun at them as he
fled. They fired at him, but he turned a corner and escaped, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Villatoro, who was hit several times, turned up at his sister's
Van Nuys home, authorities said. Police arrived as Villatoro was
being put into an ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   Both Villatoro and the man police believe he shot, Yong Kap Kim,
remained in serious condition Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   At 1 a.m., officers patrolling near Central Avenue and 53rd Street
in South Los Angeles saw two young men who they believed were
stealing a car. The men ran but were soon spotted by the officers
with three others in a white Lexus, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the car's driver tried to run over one of the
officers, who then fired into the car.</TE>
<TE>   The car missed the officer but crashed at a nearby intersection.
Two of the car's passengers, both underage, died as a result of the
crash, police said. They had been shot in the knee and hand. Two of
the surviving passengers were also juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, Miguel Solorzano, 20, was admitted to the jail ward at
County-USC Medical Center in Los Angeles and charged with assault
with a deadly weapon on a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   The final incident occurred at 4 a.m. as officers were leaving the
Southeast Division station near Broadway and 108th Street.</TE>
<TE>   The officers witnessed a shooting and were then fired at when they
intervened, officials said. One of the officers fired back, but no
one was hit and the suspect fled, police said.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County Sheriff's Department is investigating the death of
an 11-month-old Tustin boy who crawled unseen into his family's
swimming pool and drowned Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Peralta, who lived in the 18000 block of Vanderlip Avenue,
was discovered by his parents shortly after they noticed he was
missing. He was pronounced dead at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana
at 5:15 p.m., according to the Orange County Coroner's Office.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators said the boy's mother had a migraine headache and
went to lie down, leaving the boy in a room with two siblings.</LD>
<TE>   "The baby slipped out, crawled down the hallway, out the door and
was found in the pool," said Sheriff's Lt. David Wilson. "This is not
a matter of neglect as far as we can tell," Wilson said. "The
investigation is continuing."</TE>
<TE>   The boy was found by his father, who attempted to perform CPR,
Wilson said.</TE>

<HD>Studies See Big Quake as More Likely</HD>
<DH>Magnitude 7 or higher temblor on San Andreas fault in
Inland Empire, Palm Springs may occur sooner than thought. Reports
stir dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Usha Lee McFarling</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new analysis of the San Andreas fault that peers thousands of years
into its turbulent past suggests that sections in the Inland Empire
and Palm Springs area may be more primed for a major earthquake than
previously believed.</LD>
<LD>   The new work -- already the subject of dispute -- also indicates
that the San Francisco Bay Area could soon emerge from the relative
seismic quiet that has lasted since the magnitude 7.1 Loma Prieta
quake in 1989.</LD>
<LD>   The findings are included in 14 reports published today after
years of study intended to help scientists forecast the next big
shakers -- greater than magnitude 7 -- along the dreaded California
landmark. One of the studies looked back 1,500 years at more than a
dozen earthquake cycles -- a far richer information trove than the
two or three cycles that earthquake archeologists typically find.</LD>
<TE>   The Palm Springs study found that a stretch of the fault there,
which once experienced temblors on average every 215 years, has not
ruptured in 326 years -- indicating that much stress has accumulated
from the movement of plates deep in the Earth. The research team
believes this means that a "big one" could be more than a century
overdue in that area.</TE>
<TE>   A similar though even less conclusive pattern was seen on the San
Bernardino strand of the San Andreas running through the now-highly
populated Inland Empire, which ruptured during the 1600s, and not in
1812 as previously assumed.</TE>
<TE>   "We already knew we had a high seismic risk in the Inland Empire,"
said Sally McGill, a Cal State San Bernardino geologist. "This isn't
a call for new alarm. It's just a reminder to stay prepared."</TE>
<TE>   The findings, in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of
America, are the work of 74 paleoseismologists who have spent years
-- even decades -- digging deep trenches into the heart of the San
Andreas fault and scrutinizing disordered layers of mud, peat and
rock.</TE>
<TE>   Those layers provide a record of past earthquakes. The scientists'
work is an effort to compile the most detailed record yet of the
fault's antics to see if quakes have occurred in regular, predictable
patterns.</TE>
<TE>   If they do, many geologists say, there would have been a large
earthquake by now in tiny Parkfield in southern Monterey County,
where major rumblings seemed to have occurred with striking
regularity -- on average every 22 years -- since 1857. The last quake
was in 1966. The U.S. Geological Survey has spent tens of millions of
dollars there to "trap" the major quake they were sure would strike
by 1988. They are still waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "We disproved that [theory] in Parkfield, publicly and with great
embarrassment," said Lucy Jones, a seismologist who heads the
survey's Pasadena office. She was not involved in the newly reported
research.</TE>
<TE>   Jones is among those who think that earthquakes occur randomly and
that past activity is not a significant factor.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's not perfectly periodic," said Ned Field, another
seismologist at the survey's Pasadena office, who is leading a
project to produce more precise hazard maps. "The question is whether
it's periodic at all."</TE>
<TE>   If quakes are random, Field said, they may be triggered by small,
unpredictable movements on faults that generate larger quakes, or by
movement on neighboring faults.</TE>
<TE>   Time elapsed since past quakes is not factored into the state's
earthquake hazard maps, Field said. The official forecast is for an
85% chance of a magnitude 7 or higher Southern California quake in
the next 30 years on the San Andreas or one of the smaller faults.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings may help refine estimates of the earthquake risk
on segments of the San Andreas. But the results are not expected to
dramatically alter the assessment of overall seismic risk in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Still other explanations have been offered for why the strands of
the San Andreas near Palm Springs and San Bernardino have not
ruptured in 300 years.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure that produced them may have changed, Jones said.
Shifting tectonic plates under the Earth's crust may be transferring
stress to the newer, 1-million-year-old San Jacinto fault, a San
Andreas offshoot.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 20-million-year-old San Andreas is the best known and
most studied fault on Earth, it remains a mystery. That's because the
written record of its earthquakes is just 200 years old and includes
only a handful of magnitude 7 or larger quakes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've only been here a few centuries. It's sort of like we just
met the San Andreas and we're trying to figure out what our neighbor
is going to do," said Lisa Grant, a paleoseismologist at UC Irvine
who edited the edition of the journal containing the new research.</TE>
<TE>   To test the idea that earthquakes occur regularly, scientists
estimate that they need data on about 30 past quakes on the same
stretch of the San Andreas, a record that would probably stretch back
4,000 years. They are nearly halfway there.</TE>
<TE>   The research published today includes information on a trench dug
near Wrightwood in the eastern San Gabriel Mountains and studied for
more than a decade. What scientists see there is 1,500 years of
history, during which there were at least 14 major earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   Digging into a fault's past becomes harder as seismologists go
deeper. Sediments get smashed, thin and illegible. Ground squirrels
dig holes in the layers. Storms turn the trenches into mud pits.</TE>
<TE>   Work on the trench by the Geological Survey's Tom Fumal and the
University of Oregon's Ray Weldon, both geologists, is considered a
monumental achievement by many of their colleagues -- even those who
don't agree with the conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Wrightwood area has had a quake about once every
century through much of its history, the section of the San Andreas
there has not ruptured for 215 years, Fumal said. "It's really
starting to approach the longest time we see between earthquakes.
That's true of all locations from Wrightwood south. To me, it says
that whole part of the fault is ready to rupture."</TE>
<TE>   He found that many fissures on the central and southern portions
of the fault were 150 miles long or more -- much longer than
previously assumed -- and probably caused by big quakes. Based on
this, he said, "It looks like when it does rupture, it's going to be
a large one."</TE>
<TE>   Another of the 14 studies, focusing on newspaper articles and
damage reports from the early California missions, provides a wealth
of new data on the fault's relatively recent past.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 200 years, the Bay Area has experienced spikes in
earthquake activity in decades leading up to its major temblors.
After the big quakes, the area has been still, with no magnitude 5 or
larger quakes. The region has been in one of those lulls since 1989,
when the 7.1 Loma Prieta quake struck.</TE>
<TE>   Tousson Toppozada, the California Geological Survey seismologist
who led the research, said it appears to be time for the shaking to
resume.</TE>
<TE>   Current forecasts say there is a 70% chance that a large quake
will occur on one of the faults in the Bay Area in the next three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   Toppozada also found that the four largest earthquakes on the San
Andreas have occurred in geographic pairs that ruptured overlapping
parts of the fault.</TE>
<TE>   The southern portion was hit by a 7.5 magnitude quake near
Wrightwood in 1812 and an 8.0 temblor at Ft. Tejon, near the
Grapevine northwest of Los Angeles, 45 years later. In the north, the
great 1906 San Francisco quake, magnitude 7.8, occurred just 68 years
after a 7.0 quake on the San Francisco Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Toppozada has no explanation for the apparent pairings. But it
does make him think that the Loma Prieta shaker has a twin quake yet
to come -- albeit possibly decades away.</TE>
<TE>   As for that nagging question of why the much-expected quake at
Parkfield hasn't happened, Toppozada now thinks he has the answer:
That stretch of the fault may not be so regular after all.</TE>
<TE>   By including reports of Parkfield earthquakes that had been
dismissed or overlooked earlier, Toppozada found that there was no
22-year pattern. Instead, he said, the rate and force of earthquakes
there have been declining since 1857.</TE>
<TE>   He thinks this is because Parkfield sits at the very end of the
225-mile rupture from the Ft. Tejon quake. Such a point is typically
a site of high seismic stress. Each earthquake has relieved some of
that stress, he said, and that segment of the fault may no longer be
vulnerable. "It's a pretty exciting finding," he said. "A Parkfield
quake may not happen after all."</TE>

<HD>Donor Gives to Honor Wife and Save Lives</HD>
<DH>Businessman is moved by his success and his setbacks to
pledge $5.3million to a medical center for a program to fight
substance abuse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Merl</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Karl B. McMillen has savored some of life's sweetest gifts: a long
and happy marriage, a Midas touch in business, and the robust health,
at age 74, to keep on expanding the firm he built from scratch.</LD>
<LD>   McMillen also has endured some of life's toughest challenges: the
death of his firstborn son from a drug overdose, the loss -- to
cancer -- of his wife of 48 years, and his own battle with alcohol
abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Now the Manhattan Beach man, who made his fortune in plumbing
contracting and supply, has dug deep into his pockets in a carefully
planned gesture that ties together the blessings and the pain.
McMillen has pledged $5.3 million to Torrance Memorial Medical Center
to develop a comprehensive program to combat drug and alcohol
addiction.</LD>
<TE>   The Thelma McMillen Center, named in memory of the businessman's
wife, is scheduled to open next August. The outpatient facility, to
be housed in a newly purchased building next to the hospital, will be
large enough to serve more than 400 patients a year. That will at
least double the capacity of the medical center's chemical dependency
program, now limited to adults.</TE>
<TE>   McMillen's donation, which Torrance Memorial officials said is the
largest private gift in the hospital's 77-year history and one of the
largest ever to any community hospital, will enable development of a
program for adolescents and will help pay for treatment for uninsured
patients. The center will have dedicated rooms for counseling,
treatment and meetings, plus a library and exercise space.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much need for these programs," McMillen said during a
recent interview in his tidy office at the Hawthorne headquarters of
Todd Pipe and Supply, the firm he co-founded in 1966 after selling
his interest in a previous firm and "retiring."</TE>
<TE>   He recalled how the family had agonized as their bright, athletic
son Mark struggled with his drug addiction before succumbing to an
accidental overdose in 1986. He was 31.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his son's death, McMillen wrote to a community
weekly newspaper and urged publication of the eulogy a former teacher
of Mark's had read at the funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "We all recognize that drug use in the South Bay is rampant,"
McMillen wrote in the Beach Reporter, "and, perhaps, just perhaps,
the publication of the eulogy might dissuade some young person from
following the inevitable tragic path our boy took."</TE>
<TE>   Through his donation, McMillen believes he has found a far more
effective way to join the war on addiction -- and to honor the memory
of his wife, who did volunteer work for the South Bay Free Clinic and
other causes for many years.</TE>
<TE>   "Through the Thelma McMillen Center, we can save lives," he said,
blue eyes lighting with enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel fortunate that I am at a point in my life where I am able
to give back something."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Arizona and raised during the Depression, Karl McMillen
learned the value of hard work from his father, a former school
district administrator who worked as a bookkeeper for a plumbing
company after the stock market crashed and he moved the family to
California.</TE>
<TE>   After a three-year stint in the Marines, McMillen worked as a
plumber to pay his way through USC, graduating in 1954 with a degree
in business administration. With Thelma by his side and a favorite
professor as mentor and advisor, he built businesses in plumbing
contracting and commercial real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Since its founding 36 years ago, McMillen has built Todd Pipe and
Supply into one of the largest wholesale plumbing distributorships in
the nation, with eight branches and plans for a ninth.</TE>
<TE>   He refers to the firm's 400 employees as "team players," calls the
customers "partners," and included such phrases as "honesty, trust
and integrity" in the company's mission statement. He often arrives
at the office at 5 a.m. and stays till 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   McMillen lives comfortably but not lavishly.</TE>
<TE>   "I could buy a fancy boat or big house up in Palos Verdes, but I
don't need them," McMillen said. "I'd rather spend the money on
something worthwhile."</TE>
<TE>   The Torrance Memorial donation was not McMillen's first venture
into philanthropy. In 1995, he and his wife gave $1.5 million to
endow the Kenneth L. Trefftz Chair in Finance at USC -- a tribute to
his former professor and mentor.</TE>
<TE>   McMillen said he was inspired by the late George Graziadio, a
shopping center developer and banker who gave generously to
Pepperdine University. Graziadio also donated money to Torrance
Memorial, and that, McMillen said, helped him decide on a recipient
for his own gift.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think we needed to reinvent the wheel; I followed his
steps and used his expertise."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, McMillen mused aloud, his gift will inspire others, much
as Graziadio's did him.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it is important to do what you can to help," McMillen
said, "and I am hoping that by me doing this, maybe someone else will
step up too. That would be neat."</TE>

<HD>Civil War Vets: From Brave to Grave</HD>
<DH>History-minded reenactors fervently salute 26 buried at two
cemeteries. Plots that were neglected suddenly aren't.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claire Luna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tombstone dulled to a mottled yellow and the grass around it
unmarked by flag or flower, it was plain that Sgt. John Griley's
grave hadn't been fussed over in a while.</LD>
<LD>   But if the Civil War veteran could have seen what happened above
his Huntington Beach burial plot Saturday morning, he likely would
have been reassured that he has not been forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   A flag, two bunches of daisies and a promise to restore his
tombstone's appearance were showered on his final resting place,
along with those of 25 others, by Civil War reenactors who paid their
respects to veterans of the war between the states at two cemeteries
in Orange County.</LD>
<TE>   This year, about a dozen compatriots joined Ray "Skip" Hutton, 61,
of Huntington Beach for the first time since he started posting flags
at Civil War veterans' graves five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "This takes what we do as reenactors all the way through," said
retired Army Sgt. Major David Crichton, 47, of Fort Irwin. "By coming
here we're honoring their whole lives, not just what they did in
battle."</TE>
<TE>   Sweltering in their wool uniforms, the reenactors split up to
stand by individual graves during the three-minute color guard
ceremonies at Good Shepherd Cemetery in Huntington Beach and
Westminster Memorial Park.</TE>
<TE>   Calling out to stake his claim to "the Illinois dude," Crichton
bounded toward Griley's grave because his great-grandfather also
fought in an Illinois company.</TE>
<TE>   Reenactor Neil Morrison's shouted commands echoed through the
muggy air to the surrounding strip malls. In response, the costumed
soldiers touched their swords to the headstones and knelt graveside.</TE>
<TE>   "With that husky voice, I know those boys heard us," Hutton said
as he approached Griley's grave.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the stone, he said, "John, my boy, you maybe wouldn't
want this much bother taken over you, but we will anyway. You deserve
it."</TE>
<TE>   After the ceremony, Huntington Beach resident Mary Martin and two
other women in Civil War-era blouses and hoop skirts fanned out to
place two flowers with crisscrossed stems on each grave. The fringe
of Martin's soft pink shawl trailed on the grass as she stooped over
the stones.</TE>
<TE>   "I think of the hardships of these people and what they endured
during those horrendous battles," she said. "I feel like this is the
least we can do for people who survived those times and then came out
to start settling Orange County."</TE>
<TE>   Some people whose relatives had been left out of Civil War veteran
records joined the reenactors to ask if those graves could be
included in the tribute.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress resident Shirley Roberts said her great-grandfather, Henry
Posther, had served in Indiana before moving to Southern California
and being buried in the Westminster cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Hutton promised Roberts he would hold a ceremony for the man
Monday after verifying his service.</TE>
<TE>   "It might not mean much to him at this point," Roberts said, "but
I would like to see him remembered."</TE>

<HD>Effort to Revive Hemp Industry Encounters Stigma of
Marijuana</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He may have the enthusiasm of a New Age Johnny Appleseed, but if John
Roulac scatters the seeds of his favorite crop, he could wind up
behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   And that infuriates the Ojai entrepreneur, who sees hemp as a
remedy for America's ailing farms and as a way to invigorate national
health.</LD>
<LD>   He's pushing not marijuana, but industrial hemp, which contains
only trace amounts of THC, the chemical that puts the buzz in
Cannabis sativa.</LD>
<TE>   Roulac owns and operates Nutiva, one of the largest hemp food
companies in the country. He converts hemp seeds from Canada into
snack bars and oil sold in 1,200 health-food stores nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "You can a smoke a truckload of this stuff and all you'll get is a
headache," he said, relaxing in the organic garden of his rural Ojai
home.</TE>
<TE>   Roulac leads a hemp-centric life. He cooks with hemp oil, grazes
on hemp seeds, wears clothes made of hemp fiber and writes books
about hemp.</TE>
<TE>   His nimble mind constantly turns over new applications for hemp, a
crop he calls the soybean of a new generation -- rich in omega-3
fatty acids and protein.</TE>
<TE>   But Roulac's hemp noshing and peddling days could be numbered.
Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration declared hemp foods
containing THC illegal and gave those making or selling hemp foods
120 days to get rid of their stock.</TE>
<TE>   With their livelihoods threatened, Nutiva and six other hemp
businesses joined with the Hemp Industries Assn. of America to sue
the DEA in the hope of blocking the ban.</TE>
<TE>   The case is now before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in
San Francisco, considered one of the nation's more liberal venues. A
decision is expected soon.</TE>
<TE>   DEA officials said they became interested in the issue after
seeing increasing numbers of hemp products on the market. Some had
labels saying they contained THC. This led to public confusion over
what is and isn't legal, the DEA said in a filing with the Federal
Register.</TE>
<TE>   "The law is pretty clear," DEA spokesman Will Glaspy said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "If it contains THC and it's meant for human consumption, then
it's an illegal product. Congress does not make allowances for trace
amounts. The law specifies that any amount of THC is illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the law has always excluded oil and nonviable hemp
seeds from the prohibition.</TE>
<TE>   "They are legal and not on the list of controlled substances,"
said Joseph Sandler, the attorney representing the hemp industry in
the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The DEA said that if the court rules in its favor, local
jurisdictions will decide how to prosecute those eating or selling
hemp foods.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial hemp has about 0.3% THC, while marijuana hemp, which
belongs to the same plant family, has 5% to 20%.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to legalize industrial hemp have created some bizarre
bedfellows.</TE>
<TE>   Roulac, an activist who once held a hemp tasting in front of the
DEA headquarters, is allied with James Woolsey, a Washington lawyer
and lobbyist for the hemp industry who was director of the Central
Intelligence Agency from 1993 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "This has nothing to do with marijuana," said Woolsey, who sits on
the board of the North American Industrial Hemp Council.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a tie-dyed T-shirt in the outfit here. We are opposed
to marijuana legalization. We want to grow hemp entirely for fiber."</TE>
<TE>   Roulac, 43, chuckles when he thinks of Woolsey as hemp's chief
spokesman. "The politics of hemp is really wild," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It is legal to import hemp fiber and seeds that are shelled or
otherwise made nonviable. But growing hemp and importing hemp leaves
and flowers, which contain most of the plant's THC, are illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say 25,000 items can be made from hemp. The fiber is
used in paper, clothing, even interior car parts.</TE>
<TE>   David Bronner of Escondido runs Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps, which
sells soap made partly of hemp oil.</TE>
<TE>   "We worry that the DEA will roll over the food companies and go
for the body soap next," he said. "They might say the THC can be
absorbed into the body."</TE>
<TE>   Woolsey said industrial hemp is an ideal rotation crop that
replenishes farm soil. He said its fiber could someday replace
plastic, which is made of petroleum byproducts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understandable that the government wants to be a vigilant
watchdog regarding marijuana, but there are a number of perfectly
rational governments that grow industrial hemp, and there is no
evidence that people want to smoke it," he said, noting that hemp is
grown in Canada, France, England and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Roulac, who steers clear of the politically charged issue of
legalizing marijuana, stays on his message like a politician. It's
all hemp, all the time.</TE>
<TE>   He rattles off recipes for hemp pancakes, hemp milk and hemp
gravy. He notes that George Washington grew hemp, and says hemp
figured prominently in ancient Chinese medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "That parachute George Bush Sr. wore when he bailed out over the
Pacific in World War II," he said, "that was made of hemp. So were
his shoelaces."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in the wealthy enclave of San Marino, Roulac has long been
drawn to environmental causes.</TE>
<TE>   "I became an environmental activist to make a living doing
something I believed in and to provide solutions to environmental
problems," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He helped start 50 community composting programs throughout
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, he saw a U.S. Department of Agriculture film called "Hemp
for Victory" that was made during World War II and urged farmers to
grow hemp. The plant's fibers were used to make rope, parachutes and
string.</TE>
<TE>   Entranced, Roulac decided to try to revive America's hemp
industry. He said hemp is environmentally friendly and superior to
many crops.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't require pesticides or herbicides, its fibers are
stronger than [those of] trees and its seed is considered among the
most nutritious in the world because of its protein and good fat
ratios," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hemp never needs weeding because it grows faster than any weed.
You plant it and close the door. It's probably the best rotation crop
in the country from a biological standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Roulac has written three books on hemp and lobbied lawmakers. He
founded Nutiva in 1999, and today it has offices in Ojai and
Sebastopol and a warehouse in Ontario.</TE>
<TE>   "The DEA wants to equate a candy bar with heroin," he said
indignantly. "Isn't the drug war going a little far here?"</TE>
<TE>   At the Rainbow Bridge Natural Food store in Ojai, owner Ernest
Niglio bristled at the idea that the DEA could order him to remove
hemp foods from his shelves.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are told to remove it, we will remove it," he said. "But
the real reason for the opposition seems to be the stigma of
marijuana."</TE>

<HD>Teens Find a Place of Refuge at Operation Safe House</HD>

<LD>Adriana says she looks a lot like a man she doesn't know: her father.
For that, she says, she pays a price.</LD>
<LD>   "My mom hits me all the time," the 14-year-old says. "She hates my
father, and I look just like him. I'm a reminder."</LD>
<LD>   Adriana, who is being identified only by her first name, says her
relationship with her mother has recently deteriorated to new lows.
When she ran away from home, she landed at a friend's house and in a
world that she says many runaways face, one of cigarettes, pot,
vodka, total chaos.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this month, police officers picked her up and took her to
a place they rely on: Operation Safe House, a 17-bed shelter and
school for runaway and homeless teens in Riverside.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a lot safer here," Adriana said. "I have a chance to get
away from the pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Operation Safe House, now in its 12th year, is being featured as
part of this year's Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign. Agencies
helped by the annual campaign provide services to disadvantaged
children and youths such as food, clothing, shelter, childhood
literacy programs, services for developmentally delayed and disabled
children, and programs on preventing violence, drug abuse and teen
pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit agency, the only shelter of its kind in Riverside
County, received $10,000 from last year's campaign. Serving teens
ages 12 to 18, Operation Safe House is open 24 hours a day, 365 days
a year, serving more than 600 youths annually. And it operates a
school.</TE>
<TE>   Social workers and therapists try to resolve problems between
parents and children, and typically attempt to reunite the two sides
within two weeks. Some children, unable to return home because of
abuse or other problems, are placed in the care of another relative
or moved to a foster home.</TE>
<TE>   The organization operates on a $650,000 annual budget, said
Executive Director Kathy McAdara, about 80% of it from federal and
county grants. The rest comes from private donations.</TE>
<TE>   "These are kids who feel that they have no other option than to
take to the streets," McAdara said. "We like nothing better than to
get everybody back home together. That's what we strive for. It
doesn't always work. But we try."</TE>
<TE>   More than half the teens are brought to the shelter by police.</TE>
<TE>   "The only alternative for the kid a lot of times is to run away,"
said Valerie Hill, president of the organization's board and a
Riverside County Sheriff's Department division chief. "Here is a
place for them to go that is safe."</TE>
<TE>   Kristen, 16, another temporary resident, said she turned to the
streets after running away from an abusive father. "I wasn't making
good decisions," she said. "I knew I needed to turn my life around.
So here I am."</TE>

<HD>Cooking Their Way to New Opportunities</HD>
<DH>A nonprofit foundation gives immigrants training in food
handling, catering and starting a business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Saidi</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>EL CAJON, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A nonprofit foundation here is trying to encourage low-income women
to join together to learn job skills and entrepreneurship, with some
herbs and spices thrown in.</LD>
<LD>   The International Women's Kitchen makes its new home in a
renovated house off El Cajon's Main Street, pledging to help turn
women immigrants from around the globe into self-sustaining
businesspeople.</LD>
<LD>   What began as an informal idea -- "Let's cook" -- has evolved into
a comprehensive training program in catering, food handling and
starting a business, all facilitated by a nonprofit organization,
Downtown El Cajon Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Two years ago, the organization was approached by local immigrant
women who wanted to open a vending booth at the community's farmers
market.</TE>
<TE>   The initial idea was the women's, said Laura Jones, now manager of
the International Women's Kitchen. The organization "just put it into
pretty words [in a grant proposal] and got money."</TE>
<TE>   The seed money came from the San Diego Foundation, a charitable
organization that had researched 18 neighborhoods in San Diego County
and found that this diverse city 15 minutes from downtown San Diego
had a worrisome potential for tension among its immigrant
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The program now provides a full curriculum of courses taught by
visiting professionals and translated into Spanish and Arabic through
United Nations-style headsets. There are classes in basic nutrition
and food presentation, as well as such general business classes as
how to file taxes and micro-enterprising, which spells out the ABCs
of starting your own business.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the program will soon enable the International
Women's Kitchen to move completely into its new home, where meetings
have been held but the kitchen is not quite ready.</TE>
<TE>   While preparing meals, women -- mainly from Mexico and the Middle
East -- work alongside one another using hand gestures and smiles.
Occasionally they try their English for important words such as
"salt."</TE>
<TE>   Women such as Maria Silva and Petra Acosta, both from Mexico, cook
meals with Kaniah Zangana and Victoria Miran, Kurdish immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The women cater local business seminars, nonprofit gatherings and
fund-raisers and operate booths at concerts.</TE>
<TE>   They are learning to prepare one another's traditional dishes, and
Silva even boasts that she has made the Arabic dessert baklava at
home, to the delight of her husband, Eduardo.</TE>
<TE>   The menu for any given event may feature Mexican food, with
tamales and carne asada, or Arabic selections such as kabobs and
saffron rice. A sample dessert buffet is an international cornucopia
of treats from basbousa -- an Egyptian cake -- to flan, sweet tamales
and coconut macaroons.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jones throws in her grandmother's recipe for fried chicken
and collard greens to meet some clients' demands.</TE>
<TE>   A professional chef and businesswoman who gave up a business
career in New York City shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, Jones
said she's seen some of the women transformed by the program since
she joined it.</TE>
<TE>   They're learning English, Jones said, and gaining skills. Some are
also getting greater help from their husbands with housework and
child care.</TE>
<TE>   "On a personal level," Jones said, "I see them becoming more
competent, more outspoken. It's their personalities sort of
blossoming."</TE>
<TE>   On quiet Orange Street, just off El Cajon's industrious Main
Street, sits a brightly lighted renovated house containing the
program's kitchen, which has been certified by the county Health
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Donations, including a free roof, helped make the building
possible. And now the kitchen is within days of opening, Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Jones takes the women and cooking supplies to
various neighborhood kitchens before each job.</TE>
<TE>   The women make many of the business decisions, from deciding on
the menu to setting the prices. Jones provides the women with
spreadsheets of their personal and business finances -- documents
they can use for insurance or tax purposes.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Wednesday night, some of the women seemed uneasy with
the program's goal of encouraging them to move on and start their own
businesses. They know another group of women is waiting to enter the
program.</TE>
<TE>   Jones reassured them, saying they can stay in the program as long
as they want to. Then she used a chalkboard to reiterate the
program's parameters: The nonprofit pays 25% of the food costs, and
10% of profits go back into the Women's Kitchen. The net profit is
divided among the women working the job.</TE>
<TE>   So far the money they earn is minimal: $100 for each woman on a
very good night of catering. But, whether working the booth at the
farmers market or planning menus, the women display enthusiasm and
ambition.</TE>
<TE>   Acosta is grateful for even a little bit of her own money in her
pocket. "I can go buy groceries and don't have to ask my husband for
money," she explained through a translator. "If I want something for
the kids, I can go buy it."</TE>
<TE>   Jones predicted that some of the women will form their own
businesses, and others will simply be bolstered by the chance to make
alliances and strengthen the community.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the kitchen manager predicted, the women will run the
program themselves, and training might even be expanded and child
care added.</TE>
<TE>   "The women who are in it, they're all very intelligent, they're
excited," Jones said, "because this is their business. They all have
hopes and dreams of what they want to do, and we're hoping that soon
we'll be able to call them graduates."</TE>

<LD>Whhhewwww.</LD>
<LD>   It was a close call, but the nation can breathe another sigh of
relief.</LD>
<LD>   The threat has been extinguished.</LD>
<TE>   Nine soldiers who attended a training center in Monterey,
including at least six who speak Arabic, have been discharged by Army
storm troopers.</TE>
<TE>   Suspected spies? No.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorist collaborators? No.</TE>
<TE>   But they threatened to undermine military unity and national
security nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   They're gay.</TE>
<TE>   The nine were dismissed over several months, but the news of their
discharge couldn't have been more appropriately timed.</TE>
<TE>   There was the contemptible Osama bin Laden again last week, or so
the experts seem to think, speaking to us from who-knows-what cave. I
still get a shiver when the FBI warns in dire terms, as it did
Thursday, that intelligence "chatter" suggests Al Qaeda is planning
another "spectacular" attack.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't the first one happen at least partly because of a shortage
of intelligence personnel to intercept and interpret such chatter?
And if so, is this any time to worry about the sexual orientation of
someone who might help save our lives?</TE>
<TE>   Alastair Gamble, 24, got the heave-ho in August. He speaks pretty
good Arabic, but was kind enough to tell me his story in English.</TE>
<TE>   He was inspired to enlist after internships at two Navy sites,
including one in an intelligence unit. The Navy wouldn't take him
because of a vision problem.</TE>
<TE>   But he had studied Latin and German while earning a college
degree, and the Army put him on track for the Defense Language
Institute in Monterey.</TE>
<TE>   In basic training, Gamble says, he qualified as marksman on the
M-16. At the language institute in Monterey, he got a letter of
commendation.</TE>
<TE>   "Sept. 11 certainly made me more committed to the military. At
least, I became more committed to learning the language," says
Gamble.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember listening to some taped interviews of Osama bin Laden
in class right after the attacks and picking up words and phrases,
even at that early stage in the course."</TE>
<TE>   But last spring, in the middle of the night, he got a visit that
would end his military career.</TE>
<TE>   Gamble had been seeing another soldier in the language school, and
because Robert Hicks was about to graduate and move on, they risked a
night together in Gamble's room.</TE>
<TE>   "At 3:30 a.m., we both woke to the fire alarm in my building,"
Gamble says, "and a knocking at the door announcing a surprise
'health and welfare' inspection."</TE>
<TE>   Gamble bought some time while Hicks tried to climb out the window,
but a sergeant was waiting outside.</TE>
<TE>   Get these "inspectors" to Baghdad immediately. Saddam won't stand
a chance.</TE>
<TE>   The two were marched off for questioning while three platoon
sergeants searched Gamble's room. He says they turned up a gay-themed
movie, some photos of him and Hicks, and his journal.</TE>
<TE>   Gamble knew they were goners. Under the military's "don't ask,
don't tell" policy toward gays -- established by a president who
wrote the book on artful deception -- the discharge process would
begin.</TE>
<TE>   Says Gamble:</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how many people, once I was outed, came up to me
and said, 'I don't agree with your lifestyle, but what this comes
down to is whether I would share a foxhole with you, and I would.' "</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry over what happened next.
While awaiting his discharge, Gamble says, the Army took note of his
command of Arabic and assigned him to work as a substitute teacher in
the program from which he'd just been dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   Go, Army.</TE>
<TE>   UC Santa Barbara's Aaron Belkin, who runs a study of sexual
minorities in the military, says there is no evidence that 23 foreign
militaries have low morale or "unit cohesion" problems due to the
presence of openly gay soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the gay ban itself that undermines national security,"
Belkin says, "because in the midst of the most dire shortage of
language experts in history, the military has gone out of its way to
fire its best linguistic students."</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the nine gay linguists who studied in Monterey came
forward on their own over several months, saying there was an
atmosphere of hostility toward gays.</TE>
<TE>   The other two, Gamble and Hicks, 28, relocated to Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   With a jittery nation on yellow alert, Gamble's language skills
are being wasted while he tries to figure out a new career.</TE>
<TE>   But there's still some soldier in him, and he refuses to blame the
military for going by the book.</TE>
<TE>   "I must make it clear that I am not interested in people feeling
sorry for me or apologizing for what happened. I knew the possible
outcome of my actions, and I will face the consequences," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I am simply asking the question, 'Why continue to enforce this
policy when it is such a clear detriment to military proficiency? ...
At a time when the military wants to be as prepared and efficient as
possible, it is being forced ... to throw away its assets."</TE>
<TE>   I don't want them thrown away.</TE>
<TE>   Gay, straight, short, tall, young, old, it doesn't matter. Anyone
who can help protect us from killers, sign them up and put them to
work.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if the best way to bag Bin Laden is to convince the Army
he's got a boyfriend.</TE>

<HD>Riders Take to Roads to Save Tree Species</HD>
<DH>Group of bicyclists rolls out in Pasadena and San Marino in
a campaign to preserve the Engelmann oak from developers' axes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under the span of a large California oak near the Caltech campus, a
disparate group of bicyclists gathered Saturday as if on cue.</LD>
<LD>   They had chosen their meeting place in part for shelter from an
unseasonably warm November sun. But it was also for what was situated
nearby: a healthy concentration of Engelmann oaks, one of the more
endangered species in California.</LD>
<LD>   The ride, which was organized by the Arroyo Seco Foundation, was
billed as part of the group's campaign to preserve and protect the
Engelmann oak. For two hours, the cyclists crisscrossed the streets
of Pasadena and San Marino in search of tree specimens. Among the
attractions: a lone Engelmann in a parking lot just east of
Pasadena's Lake Avenue shopping district that ride organizers said is
slowly being choked to death by its concrete surroundings; a
canopy-like tree that stretched out over a quiet city street; and a
one-story house built around the few-hundred-year-old Engelmann in
its frontyard.</LD>
<TE>   "One of the reasons we are doing this on a bicycle is so that you
can get a context of the thing," Dennis Crowley, one of the ride's
leaders, told the group as members rolled toward a sprawling tree,
impressive even from a block away. "You wouldn't get that from the
windshield of a car."</TE>
<TE>   The group learned to recognize the Engelmanns by their distinctive
leaves -- oval and flat -- and by their dark brown acorns, which are
stubby and squat. The trees, they learned, are indigenous to a narrow
strip of land that straddles Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino and San Diego counties. Named for a St. Louis botanist,
the species Quercus engelemanii Greene thrives in foothill land,
typically 20 miles or more from the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   As the specimens found on Saturday's tour demonstrated, the
Engelmanns often grow to a height of more than 50 feet, and sometimes
require cabling or poles to support their heavy, octopus-like limbs.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brick, managing director of Arroyo Seco Foundation, said the
Pasadena area was at one time populated by thousands of Engelmann
oaks. But their number has dwindled as development in the area,
especially along the mesas, has led to the trees' destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "Swimming pools have taken a lot of oak trees," Brick said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's going on in this tree is incredible stuff," said
naturalist Jeff Chapman as he stood underneath an Engelmann oak on
the Caltech campus. "It's got the world's most amazing water pump."</TE>
<TE>   For the last few years, the Arroyo Seco Foundation has been
collecting the tree's acorns and raising them to seedlings at a local
nursery. Before the riders left their last stop and headed back to
their cars, Brick urged them to visit the Foundation's Web site and
help save the precious tree.</TE>
<TE>   As a leaf blower buzzed in the background, Chapman read a poem
that paid tribute to the mighty oak. "We're all messengers," Chapman
said, "of the information we've learned today."</TE>

<HD>Man Dies in Castaic Oil Well Blast</HD>
<DH>A second worker is critically burned in the early morning
explosion, felt for miles. Experts arrive to help fight the fire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One man was killed and another seriously burned Saturday in an oil
well explosion near Castaic that was felt for miles and sent flames
roaring 200 feet into the air, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   A team of oilfield disaster specialists from Texas was flown in to
extinguish the natural-gas-fed blaze, which burned throughout the day
as several dozen Los Angeles County firefighters stood near the
wreckage of a 100-foot steel derrick that toppled and melted in the
inferno.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional firefighting techniques were deemed too risky by
officials. "If we do it wrong, we could have another explosion," Fire
Department spokesman Brian Jordan said.</LD>
<TE>   Boots and Coots International Well Control, which extinguished
burning wells in Kuwait during the Gulf War, hoped to have the fire
out and the well capped by late today or sometime tomorrow, Jordan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The man who died was described as a 43-year-old member of a
four-person crew, employed by Caza Drilling Co. of Bakersfield. He
was removing an 8 1/2-inch drill bit from the well at 2 a.m. when the
explosion occurred. As of late last night, he had not been positively
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the four escaped injury, but Delton Russin, 35, of
Bakersfield was badly burned on his face and taken to Sherman Oaks
Grossman Burn Center. He was in critical but stable condition last
night.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said it was unclear what caused the explosion, which
is being investigated by Cal/OSHA, the state Division of Oil and Gas
and the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Gaz, area manager for Caza Drilling, said the explosion
appeared to have been caused by "something coming out of the well."
Laurene Lopez, a spokeswoman for the County Fire Department, said
officials were investigating the possibility that the drill bit hit a
pocket of methane that was under pressure. Gaz said that theory was
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Miller, 23, of Castaic said he and a friend were about two
miles away and felt the shock wave from the blast, then saw what
looked like a 150- to 200-foot blowtorch shooting into the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like a bomb," he said. "I thought a big propane tank at a
nearby trailer park had exploded. It was 10 times louder than a sonic
boom."</TE>
<TE>   During the day, flames died down to 15 feet but burned fiercely at
an estimated 1,200 to 2,000 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The well is part of an oilfield covering about a square mile in
Tapia Canyon that has been drilled since the early 1960s, said oil
exploration consultant Tony Kinnard, who has worked with drilling
firms in the area. Wells in the Tapia oilfield generally reach a
maximum depth of 1,200 feet, he said, adding, "You can bump into a
gas pocket easily, and you never know when it's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Ignition can occur if the drill bit sparks against another
component of the well shaft, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Henry, senior well control specialist for Boots and Coots,
said by phone from company headquarters that the four-person team
sent to Castaic would probably quell the blaze with water or
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, we can extinguish the fire with water. You need a
lot of volume, and fairly high pressure to do that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When explosives are used, they are packed at the end of a long
boom and placed at the wellhead. "It disrupts the flow of gas. It's
like blowing out a match, but a little more drastic," Henry said.</TE>

<HD>Antiwar Issue Is 'So Just Like Yesterday'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I picture Caitlin Orr wearing faded blue jeans with a hole in the
knee and an American flag patch on her backside, a tie-dyed T-shirt,
a pair of sandals and, oh yeah, some flowers in her hair. It's 1968
and she's sitting in a meadow with several hundred other college kids
listening to a local garage band and a succession of speakers
decrying the Vietnam War.</LD>
<LD>   It's me in the time warp, not her.</LD>
<LD>   The real Caitlin Orr wasn't even alive in 1968. She's 16 and goes
to Fullerton Union High School, where, among other things, she's on
the soccer team. To my knowledge, she's never sat in a meadow.</LD>
<TE>   But she is an antiwar protester in a place and time in which you
don't see a lot of them. They're hard to find on college campuses or
in Congress, let alone the halls of a Fullerton high school in Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin has Iraq on the brain, convinced the United States is
heading down the wrong path in contemplating war in the Middle East.
She's also a bit of an entrepreneur, hawking "Think Peace" T-shirts
around campus for $15 each.</TE>
<TE>   As a baby boomer who remembers the Vietnam War protest days, I ask
Caitlin if that era seems like a million years ago. "Oh, no," she
says, "it is so just like yesterday. It would seem like a long time
ago if people had matured in any way, but as you can see, history is
repeating itself. People are saying the same things now they were
many years ago."</TE>
<TE>   By that, she means the response of some of the people unhappy with
her peacenik point of view. A fellow student attempted to counter
Caitlin's argument by saying: "I would invite all those who favor
peace to take your signs to Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin says her father reminds her that "America, love it or
leave it" was the battle cry of many of those who protested the
protesters during the Vietnam War era. "He says he'd always say,
"Love it and change it,' " Caitlin says.</TE>
<TE>   What's different now -- other than 30 years passing by -- is that
there was no equivalent of Sept. 11 to color the debate during the
Vietnam era. Does anyone today doubt that the terrorist attacks on
America have muted many of those who normally would be protesting an
attack on Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin says she in no way dismisses the gravity or meaning of the
terrorist attacks on New York and Washington D.C. She just thinks
Iraq is the wrong target.</TE>
<TE>   But if an unshakable belief in their own position and
near-contempt for the other side characterized the antiwar movement
in the 1960s, Caitlin sounds a bit different. She's talking about
setting up lunch-hour discussions at school, at which people on all
sides of the Iraq issue would take part.</TE>
<TE>   Having only antiwar participants at the sessions wouldn't spur a
dynamic discussion, she says.</TE>
<TE>   My intention today is not to debate her or anyone else about Iraq.
I'm here only to praise this nascent flower child for her courage in
bucking popular opinion. It's as American now as it was when John
Adams in pre-Revolutionary War America defended British soldiers in
court for firing on Boston colonists.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, the divisions in America over Iraq don't come
close to matching those during the Vietnam era. The political
hostility in the air then got into everyone's lungs and poisoned
many.</TE>
<TE>   Caitlin seems way too chipper for that. "This could be a good
thing," she says of her fledgling campus movement. "Think peace. Who
doesn't want to think peace?"</TE>
<TE>   Ah, the innocence of the young.</TE>
<TE>   I suggest to Caitlin that Fullerton isn't exactly a hotbed of
liberalism. "I've been told that," she laughs. "But you've got to
start somewhere, right?"</TE>

<HD>Athlete in Crash Gets a Big Assist</HD>
<DH>Emotional and financial support grows for the injured
Moorpark College student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nayely Jimenez remembers nothing about the crash that cut short her
college basketball season and nearly ended her life.</LD>
<LD>   The Moorpark College freshman doesn't remember driving to her
parents' Pacoima home last month to pick up her basketball uniform on
the eve of the team's first official practice. Nor does she remember
getting slammed by a drunk driver who allegedly blew through a red
light, broadsided her car and then tried to bolt from the scene.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the 18-year-old didn't even know she had been hurt until
she woke up the next day in the intensive care unit at a Mission
Hills hospital, surrounded by posters and get-well cards from family
and friends, many of whom feared she wouldn't make it.</LD>
<TE>   That outpouring of support sparked an unprecedented fund-raising
drive at Moorpark College to which has spread beyond the east Ventura
County campus.</TE>
<TE>   The effort culminated Friday at the Lady Rangers' first home game,
where Jimenez received a rousing ovation during pregame introductions
while standing at mid-court between her coaches. The coaches wrapped
a protective arm around Jimenez, who suffered a broken jaw, head
trauma and other injuries that have blurred her vision and left her
unsteady.</TE>
<TE>   Athletic Director John Keever explained to the crowd about the
fund set up in Jimenez's honor and the goal of raising $10,000 to
help with her expenses and recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing her No. 23 basketball jersey, Jimenez then huddled with
teammates for the first time since the Oct. 14 accident and joined
them on the bench, cheering and clapping and swapping high-fives
after every good play.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been so great, I don't even know how to put it into
words," Jimenez said of all the goodwill. "To know so many people
care is just a wonderful feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Support has come from all over.</TE>
<TE>   The Moorpark College Foundation established a fund in her honor
that so far has raised more than $6,000. Most donations have come in
response to mass e-mails sent to faculty and staff at the three
schools in the community college district.</TE>
<TE>   The college also raised more than $1,000 through ticket sales for
a drawing held after halftime of Friday's game. The prizes -- which
included piano lessons, a basket of Avon cosmetics and a round of
golf at a Moorpark course -- were donated.</TE>
<TE>   Although it appears that Medi-Cal will cover most of her hospital
bills, Jimenez will likely have some outstanding debt. She also had
to give up her part-time job at Blockbuster, and the crash left her
without a car.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Bailey, the college's veteran public information officer,
said she has never seen such a broad segment of the college community
rally around one of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been all of these people who have been willing to step
up to the plate and do the right thing," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident even inspired a new wrinkle to the college's annual
drunk-driving prevention campaign, held last week in the quad.
Members of the women's basketball team set up booths alongside
Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Alcoholics Anonymous to solicit
donations for Jimenez.</TE>
<TE>   Team members were among the first to visit Jimenez in the
hospital. And they had worked hard since the accident to push tickets
for Friday's raffle at football games and other events.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team concept is family, so we are doing whatever we can to
help Nayely and her family," said team captain Chenne Tuimoloau. Team
members have clutched Jimenez's jersey in huddles and kept it next to
them on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted her to know she was always with us," Tuimoloau added.
"She is such a hard worker, I have no doubt she will be back."</TE>
<TE>   There were plenty of doubts, however, the day Jimenez was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   About an hour after leaving her sister's house in Simi Valley, the
5-foot-7 forward from Reseda High was on Laurel Canyon Boulevard,
preparing to turn onto Pierce Street, when her compact car was struck
by a Ford Taurus driven by 22-year-old Miguel Ayon, according to
police.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacoima man allegedly tried to flee but was tackled by
witnesses, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Ayon has been charged with several felonies, including causing an
injury while driving drunk. He has pleaded not guilty and his case is
set for a preliminary hearing this week.</TE>
<TE>   As word spread of the accident, the waiting room at Providence
Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills filled with family and
friends, including Reseda High basketball Coach Mike Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner, who coached Jimenez for two years before taking over the
men's program, said he wasn't very hopeful when he saw her for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought she wasn't coming home," said Wagner, who remembers
Jimenez as a hard worker and a model student.</TE>
<TE>   "But every day since Oct. 14, she's gotten a little bit better and
a little bit stronger," the coach said. "Even if she never plays
basketball again, I could care less. Just to hear her laughing again
is all that matters to me."</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez laughs now about her inability to eat solid food because
her jaw is temporarily wired shut. But she said no one should
question whether she will return to the basketball court.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she sneaked into the Moorpark College gym last week to
try a few free throws. She is not in constant pain, although she does
have recurring headaches and her eyes aren't working too well -- the
left one doesn't close on its own and the right one can't move to the
right.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, she has lost much of her strength, as evidenced by her free
throws, which continued to fall short until she was standing close to
the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez is not deterred. When her coaches visited last week, they
delivered greetings from her teammates and a team T-shirt that sums
up the months of healing and physical therapy that lie ahead: "Mental
Toughness, Extra Effort."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to work really hard, but of course I'll make it back,"
she said. "I'm just glad there are so many people backing me up,
because it would be hard to do it on my own."</TE>

<LD>Nayely Jimenez remembers nothing about the crash that cut short her
college basketball season and nearly ended her life.</LD>
<LD>   The Moorpark College freshman doesn't remember driving to her
parents' Pacoima home last month to pick up her basketball uniform on
the eve of the team's first official practice. Nor does she remember
getting slammed by a drunk driver who allegedly blew through a red
light, broadsided her car and then tried to bolt from the scene.</LD>

<HD>Attack Mailer Spotlights a Word That Can Sting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louis Sahagun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When attorney Ricardo Torres II recently wrote a political mailer
attacking City Council candidate Antonio Villaraigosa, he had a
special message for Mexican American voters -- one conveyed in a word
of just five letters.</LD>
<LD>   Villaraigosa, the flier told voters, was not Mexican enough to be
their political voice. And why? Because Villaraigosa is a pocho.</LD>
<LD>   Although it may mystify the rest of the population, in Mexican
American communities across California -- indeed across the Southwest
-- pocho is a powerful and nuanced word, able to sting as it leaps
off the tongue.</LD>
<TE>   When Roxanne Devora's husband uses it at home, she said, "He's
talking about a Mexican who speaks lousy Spanish -- like me. But if
someone else said it to me, I'd be offended."</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo Salazar's relatives in Mexico apply it to him,
affectionately, "because they like to kid around that I was born in
the United States."</TE>
<TE>   To John Hernandez, 14, it's a fighting word. "It means a Mexican
who acts like a white guy," he said. "A sellout."</TE>
<TE>   One of the touchstones of life in the heavily Latino communities
just east of downtown Los Angeles is an individual's sense of
self-recognition: Am I an ethnic American or a transplant loyal to
Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   "The word pocho sparks a visceral reaction from all of us born in
the Southwest," said Carlos Velez-Ibanez, professor of anthropology
and director of the Ernesto Galarza Applied Research Center at UC
Riverside. "The pejorative use of the word is at least eight decades
old."</TE>
<TE>   "Like any pejorative, it reduces a person to a category," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   But what, exactly, is pocho -- and is it a pejorative?</TE>
<TE>   Under the most common definition, pocho  -- or the feminine pocha
-- is slang for a Mexican American who is neither one nor the other,
who speaks no Spanish or speaks it poorly, who is adrift between two
cultures, or lives comfortably in both.</TE>
<TE>   Some have embraced the word, just as an earlier generation of
Mexican Americans transformed Chicano -- once a jab at poor Mexican
Americans -- into a term of pride. Lalo Lopez, a Los Angeles writer
and co-editor of Pocho Magazine, summed up the word in an essay
called "Generation Mex":</TE>
<TE>   "The Pocho enjoys a peanut butter and jelly tortilla, eats
Crispurritos, Enchurritos and Double Cheeseburgerritos regularly at
Hell Taco and loves it. The Pocho's lack of mastery of the Spanish
tongue and inability to eat spicy Mexican cuisine dooms him to a life
of inbetweeness."</TE>
<TE>   North of the U.S. border it can imply a class distinction,
referring to people who speak the Spanish-English blend called
pochismo and are assumed to be blue-collar working stiffs. South of
the international line, however, a Mexican citizen may rely on the
word to cut a wealthier Mexican American down to size as in, "You
might have a fine job and a new car, but I'm pure Mexican and you're
not."</TE>
<TE>   Hence the word's ability to endear or insult, depending on your
point of view. Or, more precisely, how you view yourself.</TE>
<TE>   It's a term whose origins are as veiled as its meanings.</TE>
<TE>   "Where did pocho come from? Maybe the same place as the word
'Chicano,' " ventured Edgar Delgado, 28. "It's been around as long as
there's been a border separating the United States and Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Anthropologists and etymologists say it's even older than that,
and trace its roots to ancient Nuahtl languages of the Sonoran Desert
in an area that is now the southwest United States and northern
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Diccionario General de Americanismos by Francisco
A. Santamaria, which is regarded as the ultimate authority on
derivations of the words of the Americas, pochismo refers to use of a
blend of Spanish and English by descendants of Spanish populations,
especially Mexican Americans in the southwestern U.S., and
particularly in California.</TE>
<TE>   The word had a starring role in one of the first novels published
in English by a Mexican American: Jose Antonio Villarreal's "Pocho,"
which came out in 1959. Set in Depression-era California, it tells
the story of Richard Rubio, a bookish pocho torn between his family's
traditional Mexican culture and his attraction to new ideas.</TE>
<TE>   A Chicano studies scholar, Rodolfo Acuna, has given the word even
further spin, referring to the trend toward assimilation among
Mexicans in California after World War II as "pochoization."</TE>
<TE>   That trend, which was marked by Mexican American parents' refusal
to let their children speak Spanish, was countered during the 1960s
by a renaissance of Mexican consciousness among high school and
college students.</TE>
<TE>   Today, pocho continues to surface in debates over identity in
communities where nearly everyone has an individual, sometimes a
painfully personal, interpretation of the word.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Figueroa, a cashier at Bob's Hand Car Wash in Boyle Heights,
recalled: "I was 10 years old when I was introduced by relatives to
friends in Hermosillo, Mexico, as a pocha."</TE>
<TE>   "I felt horrible," she said. "I wasn't sure what it meant. But it
made me feel different, and not in a good way."</TE>
<TE>   Beatrice Figueroa (no relation), an admissions attendant at Schurr
High School's adult education bungalow in Montebello, said, "It hurts
my feelings when people say, 'Oh, you're a pocha,' just because I'm
not fluent in Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   But Lou Carreon, who teaches English as a second language at the
same school, said, "While I don't go around telling people to please
call me pocho, I'm comfortable with the word."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilman Nick Pacheco's 14th District includes
communities that remain gateways for new arrivals from Mexico and
Central America. His ally, Torres, spiked 5,000 political mailers
with several racially charged allegations against his challenger,
Villaraigosa, including that he speaks "pocho Spanish."</TE>
<TE>   The mailers targeted recently registered Latino voters who were
also new American citizens, and therefore might care about such a
thing, according to a man close to the attack campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking at voters who registered right after the passage
of Prop. 187 -- when people were passionate about being Mexican,"
said the man, who asked that his name not be used. "The word pocho
can get you 100 votes in an election that can be won by 50 votes."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Villaraigosa said he was offended: "This was part
of a cynical attempt to say to voters, 'He doesn't know you. He's
different than you, and won't represent you.' I've always felt that a
leader should identify what we have in common, not what separates
us."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Rodriguez, a Chicano studies professor at Cal State L.A.,
sees an irony in all this. "What we're seeing is a game of
one-upmanship over an imaginary constituency that is able to
distinguish itself from pochos," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That constituency does not exist. The vast majority of Latinos in
Los Angeles qualify as pochos, especially Latino politicians," he
added. "Beyond that, how could Pacheco claim cultural legitimacy with
a first name like Nick?"</TE>

<HD>Flawed O.C. Ramp: Fixer-Upper or Do-Over?</HD>
<DH>Experts are trying to determine the extent of damage to
bridge linking the 405 and 55 freeways. Lawsuits are likely to follow
the fix.</DH>

<LD>Even as contractors and transportation officials say they want to
avoid the blame game and concentrate on fixing a $12-million carpool
bridge, the groundwork is being laid for a legal battle over defects
in the connector between the Costa Mesa and San Diego freeways.</LD>
<LD>   By all accounts, it is far too early to tell what is needed to get
the half-mile span into service, let alone who is responsible.
Engineers have until the end of the year to decide how to repair
structural flaws that have stalled the opening of the towering
flyover ramp.</LD>
<LD>   There has been much speculation that the entire roadway, except
for the columns and foundations, will need to be replaced at
tremendous cost to taxpayers and delays for motorists. Estimates for
a worst-case scenario have run as high as $10 million, and the
opening could be postponed almost eight months.</LD>
<TE>   "The findings and conclusions change daily," said George Urch, a
spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Authority, which is
funding the project. "What if we tear down the ramp and we didn't
need to? What if we don't and there is a safety issue?"</TE>
<TE>   The two-way carpool connector is part of a $125-million project to
relieve congestion at the junction of the Costa Mesa and San Diego
freeways. The curving bridge was scheduled to open in April, but that
now could be delayed until the end of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Work was stopped in August when construction crews found that
concrete had cracked and fallen off supporting walls of large
sections that run the length of the bridge. Although the span is in
no danger of collapsing, its ability to withstand heavy traffic is in
doubt, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   All parties are cooperating to find a remedy, but that quest is
proceeding under the guidance of attorneys who have outlined legal
issues and helped to hire engineering consultants for Caltrans and
the county agency. The various parties involved, meanwhile, talk of
"potential litigation" to hold people accountable once repairs are
made.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Caltrans said the bridge designer, CH2M Hill, and
builder C.C. Myers Inc. are responsible for "apparent" design and
construction defects. Department officials gave both companies 60
days to come up with plans to fix the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is administering the interchange project and provides
some oversight as well as design criteria. Jacobs Engineering of
Cypress, the project inspector, was hired by OCTA but reports to
Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   CH2M Hill and Myers, which is based in Rancho Cordova near
Sacramento, disagree with Caltrans' assessment and want to be paid
for the repairs. Caltrans officials said the companies have given
notice that they might file claims for damages against the agency --
a preliminary step toward legal action.</TE>
<TE>   C.C. Myers officials referred all inquiries to Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of the engineering firm emphasized that the
paramount focus for all parties is fixing the ramp.</TE>
<TE>   "We are working with all the agencies and trying to find the best
solution," said Tom Peters, Orange County area manager for CH2M Hill,
an international engineering firm. "Every option is still open.
Safety above all is the No. 1 concern."</TE>
<TE>   If there are design and construction defects, CH2M Hill and C.C.
Myers could be held responsible for the cost of the repairs, sparing
taxpayers. Contracts for the San Diego-Costa Mesa freeways
interchange project contain language that holds designers, builders
and management companies responsible for the services and products
they provide.</TE>
<TE>   Construction companies and engineering firms hired by Caltrans
also are required to have insurance to cover the costs of repairing
construction and design problems.</TE>
<TE>   However, if Caltrans' design criteria are determined to be at
fault, then the department could have to pay to repair the bridge.
Committees of Caltrans engineers set standards for a variety of
construction activities and projects, including grading, roads,
ramps, bridges and highways.</TE>
<TE>   While the legal maneuvering goes on, the contractors, Caltrans and
OCTA have been working to assess the damage. They are beginning the
process of analyzing the findings and determining the soundest
methods to repair the bridge.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the defects involve about 5% of the concrete that
covers the bridge's reinforcing steel. Layers of concrete have broken
off in 14 places, and cracks run along the interior supporting
girders.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the bridge's three sections have been damaged, which leaves
the possibility that the unaffected span won't need rebuilding.
Meanwhile, repairs needed on the two sections could be limited to
repouring concrete or partial replacement of the roadbed.</TE>
<TE>   The defects have weakened the structure and exposed the bridge's
interior reinforcing steel, which could cause it to rust and
deteriorate faster than normal. The middle section contains most of
the damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern is the impact on the road's load-carrying capacity,"
said Hank Alonso, deputy director of Caltrans District 12, based in
Irvine. "We need to determine how much the design load has been
compromised. We can't open the bridge until it is determined to be
safe."</TE>
<TE>   More than two weeks ago, CH2M Hill officials warned Caltrans
officials that the entire roadway might have to be replaced. But
Peters said the company has backed off that initial statement. "All
the recommendations are being explored," he said. "Until the facts
are in, we cannot make a final conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Officials suspect that the concrete might have fallen off when
construction crews using hydraulic machinery applied tension to
reinforcing cables that run inside the ramp. The tension, which is
designed to keep the structure from sagging, could have caused the
cables to move unexpectedly, damaging the concrete.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans records show that C.C. Myers told the transportation
department about the potential for such a problem in June 2001, more
than a year before the defects were discovered. The report indicated
that on-site personnel thought cable connecting ducts that provide
extra strength along the length of the bridge needed additional
supporting rings, or ties.</TE>
<TE>   A weekly report from a Caltrans engineer assigned to the project
said Bob Schneider, Myers' project manager, "called and informed us
that the ironworkers were concerned that not enough pre-stress duct
ties were called out on the plans for the curved girder section of
the [high-occupancy-vehicle] connector. They were concerned that the
girder ducts may blow out during pre-stressing."</TE>
<TE>   The records indicate that the Caltrans official looked into the
matter and called Daniel Sun of CH2M Hill, who confirmed that
additional duct ties were not warranted by Caltrans design criteria
-- the minimum standards set by the department to ensure the
durability and safety of roads and bridges. Sun, however, "did
mention that the design was very close to the limit of when
additional duct ties would be needed."</TE>
<TE>   According to the weekly report, the Caltrans official then called
Schneider and "let him know." Caltrans and OCTA officials say there
are no indications that CH2M Hill, C.C. Myers or the ironworkers
expressed further concerns to Caltrans about the need to add more
duct ties.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the lack of reinforcement caused the defects remains
unclear. Project records also show there were concerns about poor
concrete work in the damaged sections.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials say they stand by their statements that the
designer and the builder are responsible for the construction
defects.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Quon, head of Caltrans' Orange County office, told OCTA's
board of directors Friday that designers and contractors have a
professional responsibility to go beyond the agency's minimum
standards if unusual conditions are encountered in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Though some battle lines are being drawn, OCTA officials have been
trying to keep the accusations about responsibility to a minimum
until all the facts are known and repairs are made. Supervisor Todd
Spitzer, the authority's board chairman, has described Caltrans'
initial attempt to assign blame to the designer and contractor as
"inappropriate."</TE>
<TE>   "The inclination is to hunker down and be protective of
ourselves," Spitzer said. "As the funding agency, we have a
responsibility to hold those accountable for their work and to
protect the taxpayer. But we don't want to jeopardize the
relationships we have with others in the transportation field."</TE>

<LD>A 20-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder and arson in
connection with two fires set in Buena Park early Saturday. One was
set at a bank, and the other at a nightclub that he had been kicked
out of a few hours before, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Molina Diaz Oliverio of Buena Park was being held at the city jail
on $1-million bail.</LD>
<LD>   The first fire was reported about 2:15 a.m. at a Bank of America
branch at Commonwealth Avenue and Beach Boulevard, where a blaze had
engulfed an ATM, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty minutes after firefighters had extinguished the bank fire,
they were called to Ozz -- a dance club on Manchester Boulevard about
one-third of a mile from the bank -- where the facade and an exit
door were in flames, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Oliverio was charged with attempted murder because of that fire's
location, Miller said.</TE>

<HD>Restoration Underway in Sequoia Area</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JOHNSONDALE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A $3-million emergency project is underway to begin restoring the
charred landscape where one of California's worst wildfires
threatened groves of giant sequoias last summer.</LD>
<LD>   The McNally fire blackened 150,696 acres in the Sequoia National
Forest, Giant Sequoia National Monument and Inyo National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   During the U.S. Forest Service's first tour for area residents
Friday, district ranger Del Pengilly described what remains as "a
moonscape."</LD>
<TE>   "This is a good example of what fire looks like," Pengilly told
the Fresno Bee, overlooking a canyon once covered with trees. "It's
sad."</TE>
<TE>   The fire started July 21 when high winds spread a camper's fire,
destroying the Road's End Resort nearby. Peri Van Brunt of
Bakersfield has pleaded not guilty to illegally setting the fire and
faces a Nov. 25 court appearance.</TE>
<TE>   It took $60 million, 2,000 firefighters and six weeks to contain
the fire, which Pengilly called one of the five worst in California
history and the worst ever in the Sequoia National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The service has begun removing fire-damaged trees near roadways,
and is planning erosion-control and restoration efforts. Last week's
storm dumped about 20 inches of rain in 36 hours on some denuded
areas, covering roads and lining culverts with eroded soil.</TE>
<TE>   Emergency efforts include using fallen trees to block sliding
sediment, said wildlife biologist Steve Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Over 18 months, the service will draw up other restoration plans
including soliciting bids from timber companies to log the damaged
trees.</TE>
<TE>   Logging already is leading to clashes over the restoration plan.</TE>

<HD>Prized Property Pulled From All Sides</HD>
<DH>Developer again seeks to level 1920s building in Santa Ana.
City may overrule its planning panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Beverly Hills real estate company that has spent a decade trying to
develop a cornerstone property in Santa Ana's historic downtown will
seek permission Monday to rip down the 1920s-era building and put a
pharmacy in its place.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Planning Commission last month denied M&amp;A Gabaee's
request to raze the long-vacant Central Auto Body Works building at
1st and Main streets and erect a Sav-On pharmacy with four
second-story residential lofts.</LD>
<LD>   But city officials said the developer has been spurned so many
times that city staffers probably will advise the City Council to
overrule the commission's denial and approve the project.</LD>
<TE>   Over the last 10 years, the real estate company has proposed a
restaurant, an auto-parts store and a small shopping center on the
corner -- regarded as the gateway to downtown Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "The threat of a lawsuit is definitely going to influence them,"
said Alison Young, president of the Santa Ana Historical Preservation
Society</TE>
<TE>   City officials and Gabaee worked together on the plan for the
pharmacy as part of a settlement to a lawsuit in which the developer
alleged Santa Ana was hindering development. City officials asked
that the lofts be added to boost the adjacent Artists Village.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the compromise, the city's elected officials, historic
society commissioners and residents have never come to a consensus on
how to develop the entryway to the downtown shopping district.</TE>
<TE>   "The city has not really been able to decide what it wants on that
corner. Some people think it should be some special kind of project,"
said Fred Gaines, who represents Gabaee, a company that owns or
manages 3 million square feet of retail space in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the city should have purchased the property years ago
to give it a larger role in shaping its destiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I apologized to the owner.... What should have happened is that
the city should have bought the property and waited for the right
project," said Planning Commissioner Chris Leo, who voted to deny the
pharmacy. "This does not fit within what is going on downtown."</TE>
<TE>   In denying the plan, commissioners said the pharmacy would not
have enough parking and would be across the street from a Rite-Aid
pharmacy. Commissioners also expressed concern about adding another
retailer with a liquor license to the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Others lamented the potential loss of a vintage building.</TE>
<TE>   "The city should not be held hostage because of a lawsuit.... We
need to protect the city, particularly such an important corner,"
Young said.</TE>
<TE>   Even those voting for the project had doubts about bulldozing the
old structure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a key entryway into the historic district, and some would
like to see something more important than a drugstore," Planning
Commission President Glenn Mondo said.</TE>
<TE>   "For other people, they are horrified by something on the historic
list coming down under any circumstances," he said. "Others say they
are worried that one of the two pharmacies will go dark. And others
-- I'm in this group -- do not think the developer has been treated
fairly, and we need to address that."</TE>
<TE>   Gabaee appealed the decision to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jose Solorio said he believes that despite the history
behind the site, the resulting project "would work quite well near
the Artists Village. It has a retail element and a residential
element."</TE>

<LD>A fleet of protective airships hovering over America's borders -- an
idea recently floated by the Pentagon -- brings back memories of the
role played by pioneers of lighter-than-air craft at the turn of the
century.</LD>
<LD>   One of those daring young men was Augustus Roy Knabenshue, who
piloted one of America's first airships, the California Arrow, and
went on to found one of the first dirigible passenger services, from
Pasadena to Los Angeles, in 1912. He is buried near Burbank Airport
in a shrine that memorializes aviation heroes.</LD>
<LD>   Airships, ranging from balloons to dirigibles, have a long history
in warfare. Union and Confederate armies used aerial observation
posts during the Civil War. Lighter-than-air craft were rediscovered
by military planners for surveillance, reconnaissance and bombing in
both world wars. And it was just 40 years ago that the Navy retired
four dirigibles that had guarded the U.S. from Arctic invasion during
the early part of the Cold War.</LD>
<TE>   In war and peace, Knabenshue was at the controls of dirigibles,
extolling their virtues in a variety of roles. He built observation
balloons for the Army and Navy during World War I and, later, for
B.F. Goodrich Co. He managed the Wright brothers' exhibitions at air
meets. He established the National Park Service's aviation programs
for spotting forest fires, taking aerial photographs and surveying
wildlife. He was instrumental in organizing Los Angeles' first
international air meet, held at Dominguez Hills in 1910.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinated by Balloons</TE>
<TE>   The son of a newspaper editor, Knabenshue was born in Ohio in
1876. At age 5, he was fascinated by a balloon ascending slowly
skyward. As a teenager, he got his first ride in one.</TE>
<TE>   That was all it took to cement his dreams of flight. He bought his
first balloon in 1899 with a down payment of $25. To supplement his
income while working for the telephone company, he offered rides for
a buck.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 25, 1904, nine months after Orville and Wilbur Wright
sailed 40 yards over Kitty Hawk, N.C., Knabenshue took his balloon to
the St. Louis World's Fair. He competed in several air races, won
most of them, and sold rides to spectators.</TE>
<TE>   At the fair he met Capt. Thomas Scott Baldwin, inventor of the
California Arrow, a 95-foot-long, cigar-shaped airship filled with
explosive hydrogen and powered with a lightweight motorcycle engine.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Knabenshue made some modifications with his trusty
sewing machine, the airship proved incapable of lifting off with the
230-pound Baldwin at the helm. Baldwin asked the slimmer Knabenshue
to fly in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Knabenshue had never piloted a dirigible; he had to learn on the
fly. It took him an hour and a half to travel 11 miles, scooting back
and forth on the wooden framework to make the dirigible ascend and
descend. But he beat the competition in St. Louis, earning both
$1,000 and a name for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to learn to fly that thing ... pronto, and I did. I hit
some air currents and people said they were amazed at how I
maneuvered," he said in a 1954 interview. "I wasn't maneuvering -- I
was hanging on."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, he was hooked. For three days, beginning on
Christmas 1904, he raced the California Arrow against automobiles
between Los Angeles and Pasadena, winning by two minutes. Depending
on the weather, the trip usually took him about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Knabenshue would build 10 dirigibles for himself. He dubbed his
first model Toledo I and began to tour fairs and air shows throughout
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1905, New York Times owner and publisher Adolph S. Ochs paid
him $10,000 to fly his 69-foot-long Toledo II airship from Central
Park and circle the Times Building. It was the first flight of an
airship over Manhattan. Two years later, he built the first
three-passenger dirigible and, in 1908, took one of his
lighter-than-air vehicles on the nation's first successful night
flight.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Angeles, in 1909, Knabenshue took off from Tournament
Park in Pasadena, the current southwest corner of California
Boulevard and Wilson Avenue at Caltech. A year later, at the
Dominguez Hills air show, Knabenshue met a "clean-cut kid" named
Glenn L. Martin. Two years later, he talked Martin, then 26, into
making what would become a historic flight in an early seaplane from
Balboa Bay, near Newport Beach, to Catalina.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's flight time at 3,500 feet was 37 minutes. When he landed,
he ate a sandwich, patched a hole in one of his pontoons and flew
back. But the round trip took a few hours longer than expected, which
didn't sit well with those anxiously awaiting his return.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know he was delayed making repairs and his mother was
breathing hellfire and brimstone about me promoting the flight,"
Knabenshue said in the 1954 interview. "When Martin did get back to
Balboa, the patch on the pontoon tore loose while he was landing and
the plane sank in the bay before we could get it ashore. All was
forgiven then, but his mother was suspicious of me from then on."</TE>
<TE>   Knabenshue's success attracted the attention of the Wright
brothers, who wanted to enter their planes in competitions and wanted
Knabenshue to manage their team of pilots and planes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1912, while working off and on for the Wrights, he settled down
in Pasadena. He built a balloon hanger in a field on Marengo Avenue
and started a passenger and freight service to Los Angeles. He could
take 13 passengers at a time on flights from the Raymond Hotel in
Pasadena to Chutes Park at Washington Boulevard and Hill Street in
Los Angeles. To start with, he charged the unprecedented fee of $25,
which he later reduced to $10 to attract more takers.</TE>
<TE>   It was publicity as much as hydrogen that kept Knabenshue Aircraft
Corp. afloat for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   His dirigible was such a fixture in Pasadena that local residents
adopted it -- visiting it, waving goodbye to it and inquiring about
it whenever it left home for long periods.</TE>
<TE>   He inspired the Los Angeles Police Department to launch its
experimental "sky balloon," a predecessor of the high-tech military
helicopters used for surveillance today.</TE>
<TE>   Government Contract</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 29, 1915, LAPD Sgt. Hubert Kittle and U.S. Aeronautical
Reservist Jack Michael O'Connell, a former LAPD officer, took off
from Monrovia and headed toward downtown Los Angeles. Equipped with
binoculars and a "wireless telegraph" they hovered over the police
station at First and Hill streets, inspecting the faces and details
of 400 officers lined up for their semiannual inspection, which
included a parade down Broadway in front of City Hall. Today, no one
is sure whether the balloon came from Knabenshue or from O'Connell,
who at some point founded his own balloon and airship factory.</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, Knabenshue won a government contract to build 25
observation balloons -- which he called "sausages" -- at $6,200 each.</TE>
<TE>   It's likely that several of Knabenshue's airships were delivered
to Ross Field, the country's second observation-balloon training
school for Army artillery, at what is now the Arcadia County Park and
Golf Course. The first balloon school had been founded in Omaha in
1916, a year earlier, but strong winds and a severe winter had
prompted the War Department to look for a milder climate.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3,500 members of the Army Balloon Corps trained at Ross
Field, named for Cleo J. Ross, the first balloonist killed in action
during World War I. From 1917 to 1922, the corps trained spotters,
who directed artillery fire from their gondolas as the balloons
ascended above enemy lines.</TE>
<TE>   It was hazardous duty. German pilots delighted in shooting the
balloons out of the sky. Allied pilots showed a similar enthusiasm
when encountering the Kaiser's fleet.</TE>
<TE>   Honors Abound</TE>
<TE>   After World War I, Knabenshue helped the Navy test airships.
Later, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave him a commission with the
Department of the Interior from 1933 to 1944. There, he established
aviation programs for the National Park Service.</TE>
<TE>   He was honored for his aviation pioneering by many groups,
including the Early Birds of Aviation Inc., a group of 596 men and
women who flew by airplane, balloon, glider or airship before Dec.
17, 1916 -- the 13th anniversary of the Wright brothers' first
powered flight. Knabenshue, of course, was a member of that exclusive
club.</TE>
<TE>   When he retired in the late 1940s, he was in poor health and
destitute. He and his wife lived in an Arcadia trailer park.</TE>
<TE>   Just two months before his death in 1960, at age 83, he made his
last publicity appearance in a helicopter. He and aviator Charles
Willard were honored at the 50th anniversary of the first Dominguez
air show, also known as an "air circus." Five years later, he was
inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Knabenshue's scripted bronze tablet at the Portal of Folded Wings
aviation shrine in Valhalla Memorial Park is directly under the
flight path at Burbank Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The plaque reads: "Roy Knabenshue ... America's first dirigible
pilot."</TE>

<LD>Only God can make a tree, the old adage goes. But only L.A. can make
it a star.</LD>
<LD>   Like fans coming to pay homage to an idol, hundreds of families,
dancers, musicians, Native Americans, and a guy who laid down a $100
offering, converged beneath the branches of an endangered old oak in
Santa Clarita Saturday. They turned a narrow canyon road into a
bizarre sideshow featuring a would-be actor and part-time teacher
perched in the tree targeted to be bulldozed for a highway.</LD>
<LD>   A group of girls in rhinestone-studded jumpsuits danced before the
tree. A flutist and drummer softly played their music beneath its
shade. Native Americans tied colorful ribbons to a nearby fence on
land they believe is sacred. Passersby honked.</LD>
<TE>   And scores of visitors just stood around gazing at the tree and
John Quigley, the 27-year-old Pacific Palisades man who has been
sitting in it for 16 days.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hands-on experience," said David Krebs, who drove 55
miles from Anaheim for a Nature 101 lesson for his two children.
Sure, they were also visiting nearby relatives, but being witness to
a live act that is "saving the environment is important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, leaders of the Santa Clarita environmental group that
is staging the sit-in met with representatives of the developer who
was told by Los Angeles County to cut it down. They called in a
mediator to help them along.</TE>
<TE>   The one issue they all agreed on Saturday is a news blackout on
talk details. Even the location of their meeting was kept secret.
Rumor had it that they were holed up in a booth at a nearby Coco's
restaurant. But they weren't there.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very hopeful feeling as a result of the negotiations,"
is all Lynne Plambeck, president of SCOPE, the Santa Clarita
Organization for Planning and the Environment, would say.</TE>
<TE>   She visited Quigley after the meeting, telling him to hang in
there. Quigley, a part-time environmental teacher the group recruited
to the cause, said that the holidays are his slow time and he would
be the tree's live-in guardian for as long as it takes.</TE>
<TE>   One sheriff's deputy guarded the tree as fans pressed up against a
chain-link fence erected around it for safety reasons. The tree and
Quigley have become an overnight sensation as recent media reports
heightened attention to its plight and his mission.</TE>
<TE>   Parked cars lined Pico Canyon Road for more than a quarter of a
mile. The crowds arrived in waves, at times throughout the day
reaching about 200, then receding to a dozen or so.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Santino, 50, of Yucaipa heard about the tree on the radio
after the last call Saturday morning at a San Bernardino bar. He
arrived in Santa Clarita at 4 a.m. in his 34-foot long Fleetwood
Bounder motor home.</TE>
<TE>   "I was born and raised in California and I've seen the land go,"
he said. "There is no reason they can't save the tree."</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department decided against forcing Quigley down from
his high perch. Too dangerous, they said. Besides, no one has made a
trespassing complaint against him.</TE>
<TE>   Will this highly publicized stint enhance his career?</TE>
<TE>   "All I can think about right now is saving this tree," he said
Saturday via cell phone, at times acknowledging the onlookers gawking
at him. "Hey, let me read this. It's from kids and has a picture of a
tree on it," he said, holding a note. "Be strong, have faith in
yourself and we hope you are home for Christmas," wrote two girls.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he sponge-bathes with buckets of water, eats well from
donated food and instead of coming down for bathroom breaks, climbs
high into branches for privacy and relieves himself in containers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's awkward, but I'm getting used to it," Quigley said.</TE>
<TE>   There is not enough room in the canyon for both a four-lane
roadway and the tree, which sits perched near a 100-foot cliff. On
the other side of the tree lies the Pico Canyon Road and hillside
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County had approved removal of the tree on land just
outside Santa Clarita city limits to accommodate traffic for
impending housing developments.</TE>
<TE>   What the county and John Laing Homes, the developer of a
neighboring subdivision who was going to build the road,
underestimated was the wrath of Santa Clarita environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   This is a citizenry with deep oak tree roots.</TE>
<TE>   The first ordinance passed by the newly incorporated City Council
in 1987 was a moratorium prohibiting even the branch of an oak tree
from being cut without permission.</TE>
<TE>   The city logo features the graceful branches of an oak. The "Oak
of the Golden Dream" stands as a historic landmark in nearby
Placerita Canyon, the site where gold particles were discovered in
1842.</TE>
<TE>   In modern days, the valley has linked its identity to its native
oaks, naming schools, malls, streets and subdivisions after them. The
Southern Oaks housing tract lies just across the road from the
threatened tree. Avenue of the Oaks, Oakridge Lane and Oak Street are
among the roads crisscrossing the valley. Golden Oak Adult School
operates in Newhall. River Oaks Shopping Center sits in the heart of
Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   Developers typically charge homeowners thousands of dollars more
for a new home with an oak tree on its lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think so much of this valley has been leveled that people are
sick of it," said tree visitor Carl Boyer, a former mayor who served
on the city's first council.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Pico Canyon Road became a thoroughfare, it was a
popular lovers lane up until the 1970s, the tree providing a romantic
shelter.</TE>
<TE>   One tree fan, Quigley said, told him how her husband proposed to
her beneath the oak.</TE>

<HD>4th-Graders Getting a Jump on College</HD>
<DH>Pepperdine program hands $500 savings bonds to low-income
Latino children who have what it takes for higher education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 60 low-income elementary school students from Ventura, Los
Angeles and Orange counties are set today to receive scholarships
aimed at lifting them out of their poor neighborhoods and putting
them on track to attend college.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-graders will be handed $500 savings bonds as the
highlight of a mariachi concert at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza
hosted by the Pepperdine University Hispanic Council.</LD>
<LD>   The concert, which raises about $60,000 a year for Latino students
on scholarship at the Malibu university, has also become a showcase
for the educational campaign on behalf of younger students -- kids
who have what it takes to go to college but might not have higher
learning on the radar screen.</LD>
<TE>   "You can't start talking to these kids about college in ninth and
10th grade; it's too late," said Israel Rodriguez, director of the
Hispanic Affairs office at Pepperdine and creator of the Educational
Scholarship Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "The value of the bond itself is not much," Rodriguez added. "But
the idea is to get them at an early age to start thinking about
college and show them they have the same opportunities as everyone
else to go for that brass ring."</TE>
<TE>   Savings bonds will go to 63 students at schools including Wilson
Elementary in Santa Ana, Sunkist Elementary in La Puente and El
Sereno Elementary in Los Angeles. Nearly half of the scholarships
will go to Ventura County fourth-graders at schools in Oxnard and
Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Those students include 9-year-old Griselda Garcia. Along with her
farm-worker parents, she will don her Sunday best and march up on
stage at the Thousand Oaks auditorium to receive her award. She was
nominated for the scholarship by Mike Stalvey, her teacher at Ramona
Elementary School in Oxnard's La Colonia district.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at the start of the school year to recommend a student with
good grades and leadership qualities, Stalvey said he thought
immediately of Griselda.</TE>
<TE>   He had a conference with her parents last week, and both were
thrilled about the honor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a terrific program," Stalvey said. "It plants the
seed to get students and their parents thinking about their future."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, who for 24 years served as Pepperdine's financial aid
director before launching the university's office of Hispanic Affairs
in 1995, said the program is all about planting seeds for the future.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was alarmed to learn that fewer than 20% of Latino high
school graduates go on to college, and half of those students do not
obtain degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez and others with Pepperdine's Hispanic Council began
holding the annual mariachi concert in 1996 to raise scholarship
money for Pepperdine students. Two years ago, the council launched
its initiative in the elementary schools, providing nearly 50
educational savings bonds in 2000 and about the same number last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said he raises money for that effort by soliciting
donations from companies and private donors. And he has set up a
system to monitor the progress of recipients through high school.</TE>
<TE>   He also provides tickets to the mariachi concert for recipients
and their parents, calling the students on stage one by one to the
roar of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "You should see their faces light up when they are honored for
being good students," Rodriguez said. "That's the highlight of the
concert."</TE>
<TE>   McKevett Elementary School Principal Sheryl Misenhimer plans to be
there to see it happen.</TE>
<TE>   Two fourth-graders at her Santa Paula school, Luis Cisneros and
Sarai de Alejandro, are set to receive scholarships, and Misenhimer
wants to be on hand to snap photos and lead the cheers.</TE>
<TE>   "When any child works as hard as these kids do and gets recognized
for it, I'm going to be there," Misenhimer said. "It gives them stars
in their eyes, it gives them the dream."</TE>

<HD>Colorado Loses Brown, Wins Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado has earned a chance to defend its Big 12 Conference title.</LD>
<LD>   Bobby Purify rushed for 174 yards and a touchdown as the
17th-ranked Buffaloes clinched Big 12 North Division title with a
41-27 win over Iowa State on Saturday night at Boulder, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   Safety Medford Moorer returned a fumble 71 yards for a touchdown
with 5:12 left to help Colorado advance to the conference
championship game again. The Buffaloes, 8-3 overall and 6-1 in the
conference, beat Texas in last year's title game.</LD>
<TE>   Purify scored on a five-yard touchdown run with 1:43 left to seal
the win.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado will meet the winner of next week's Texas Tech-Oklahoma
game in the Big 12 championship Dec. 7 in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes managed to hold off Iowa State (7-5, 4-4) despite
losing Chris Brown in the third quarter. Brown, the nation's leading
rusher, departed with a bruised sternum after rushing for 127 yards
in 25 carries.</TE>
<TE>   To claim the division title, Colorado needed a victory over either
Iowa State or Nebraska, which the Buffaloes play in Lincoln on Nov.
29.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to leave it up to going to Lincoln," offensive
guard Wayne Lucier said. "We said all along, 'Let's end it this
week.' "</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hodge's second touchdown pass of the game, a six-yarder to
Derek McCoy, put Colorado ahead 27-20 with 10:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   With 6:02 to go, Colorado's Marcus Houston, playing for the first
time since injuring his knee in the season opener, fumbled, and Iowa
State linebacker Brandon Brown recovered at the Colorado 25.</TE>
<TE>   Two plays later, however, Cyclonequarterback Seneca Wallace, in
the shotgun formation, fumbled the snap. Moore scooped it up and ran
it back for the score and a seemingly comfortable 34-20 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State countered with a touchdown only 1:16 later on a
six-yard run by Wallace, cutting the deficit to 34-27.</TE>
<TE>   Purify, who got the bulk of the carries after Brown left the game,
responded by carrying all six times on a six-play, 80-yard scoring
drive. His 50-yard run down the left sideline set up his score four
plays later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Oklahoma 49, Baylor 9 -- Quentin Griffin had his sixth
consecutive 100-yard rushing game, running for 152 yards and three
touchdowns, and he also had a 35-yard touchdown catch to lead the
Sooners (9-1, 5-1) over the Bears (3-8, 1-6) at Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin scored the first two touchdowns for Oklahoma then had the
last two scores during a three-touchdown blitz after halftime to
extend the Sooners' lead to 42-3.</TE>
<TE>   The blowout victory probably won't help the Sooners climb back up
in the bowl championship series standings. Oklahoma dropped from
first to fourth after its 30-26 loss at Texas A&amp;M last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Missouri 33, Texas A&amp;M 27 -- Brad Smith's one-yard touchdown run
in the second overtime helped Missouri overcome blowing a
two-touchdown halftime lead to win at College Station, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who passed for 171 yards and rushed for 94 yards, threw two
touchdown passes for the Tigers (5-6, 2-5).</TE>
<TE>   The Aggies (6-5, 3-4) failed to score in the second overtime when
Missouri cornerback Michael Harden intercepted Dustin Long's pass.
Long completed 22 of 35 passes for 270 yards after replacing injured
starter Reggie McNeal, who left in the second quarter with what
appeared to be an injury to his right foot or leg. Long helped Texas
A&amp;M rally to tie the game, 24-24, in regulation. Joe Weber scored his
second touchdown on a one-yard run with 15 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma State 55, Kansas 20 -- Josh Fields threw a school-record
six touchdown passes, completing 17 of 26 passes for 354 yards to
lead Oklahoma State (5-5, 3-3) at Lawrence, Kan. Fields erased the
school record with five scoring passes in the first half. The first
three went to Rashaun Woods, the Big 12's leading receiver, who had
171 yards and three touchdowns on only seven receptions. Kansas
finished 2-10, 0-7.</TE>

<HD>Iowa Clinches Share of Title, Now Must Wait</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After time expired in Iowa's win over Minnesota, Hawkeye fans tipped
over one of the goal posts in a rowdy celebration at the Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody really cared that it wasn't their stadium. After all, Iowa
had clinched at least a share of its first Big Ten Conference title
since 1990 and reached 11 victories for the first time ever.</LD>
<LD>   Brad Banks threw for two touchdowns and ran for two more, and Fred
Russell ran for 194 yards as the No. 6 Hawkeyes forced six turnovers
and beat the Golden Gophers, 45-21, at Minneapolis.</LD>
<TE>   Jermelle Lewis had 101 yards rushing for the Hawkeyes (11-1, 8-0),
who improved to 11-1 overall and 8-0 in the conference to finish
undefeated for the first time since 1922.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really a special win," said Kirk Ferentz, who was 11-24 in
three seasons as Iowa's coach before this year. "A great day for our
team, staff and coaches and for the entire state of Iowa."</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes win the conference title outright and qualify for the
Rose Bowl if No. 2 Ohio State (12-0, 7-0) loses to Michigan at home
next week.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes, whose only loss was to Iowa State of the Big 12 on
Sept. 14, won't play again for 6 1/2 weeks and their bowl-game fate
may not be decided until the final bowl championship series standings
are released Dec. 8.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take anything right now," Banks said.</TE>
<TE>   Asad Abdul-Khaliq completed 18 of 30 passed for 205 yards, two
interceptions and had two short touchdown runs for the Golden Gophers
(7-4, 3-4), who have been bowl-eligible for a month but lost their
third in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota finishes at Wisconsin next week in what likely will be a
battle for a berth in the Sun Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Banks completed nine of 17 passes for 100 yards, and Russell
needed only 17 carries for his yards. Their efforts, plus a dominant
effort from the Hawkeyes' towering offensive line, helped Iowa win
the Floyd of Rosedale bronze pig trophy for the second straight year.</TE>
<TE>   As it usually is when the battle for Floyd is held at the
Metrodome, the overflow crowd of 65,184 was at least half-filled with
Hawkeyes fans, and the chants of "Let's go Hawks!" began well before
the opening kickoff.</TE>
<TE>   After it was over, Iowa fans streamed out of the stands and mobbed
the team on the sideline. Ferentz was carried off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "What a special group ... " Ferentz said. "I want them just to
enjoy this and appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 Michigan 21, Wisconsin 14 -- Chris Perry rushed for a
career-high 175 yards and a touchdown as the Wolverines (9-2, 6-1)
held on to defeat the Badgers (6-6, 1-6) at Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan's Markus Curry broke up a potential touchdown pass to
Jonathan Orr in the end zone with 1:29 left. Perry ran through a hole
for a 43-yard run on the final possession to seal the win for the
Michigan, which looks to spoil Ohio State's national championship
hopes next week.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin started the season 5-0 but needs to beat Minnesota at
home to earn a bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers' Anthony Davis ran for 154 yards and a touchdown. He
missed last week's game after being stabbed in the thigh during a
domestic dispute, in which he faces a battery charge.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Purdue 45, Michigan State 42 -- Kyle Orton threw a 40-yard
touchdown pass to John Standeford with three minutes left to rally
the Boilermakers (5-6, 3-4) to a victory over the Spartans (4-7, 2-5)
at East Lansing, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Orton, who came off the bench to lead the Purdue to a 24-14
victory over Michigan State a year ago at West Lafayette, Ind.,
replaced starter Brandon Kirsch on fourth and eight and threw the
winning touchdown pass. score. Kirsch was knocked out on a hard hit
by Mike Labinjo.</TE>

<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Manute Bol's efforts to raise money for the people of his warn-torn
homeland got more ice time than the former NBA player.</LD>
<LD>   The 7-foot-7 basketball player from Sudan sat on the bench
Saturday night as the puck dropped in his hockey debut. He didn't
stay long, leaving the rink while the Central Hockey League game was
still going on.</LD>
<LD>   Bol made his first appearance with the Indianapolis Ice at Conseco
Fieldhouse when the team faced the Amarillo Gorillas. Bol signed a
contract with the Ice last week.</LD>
<TE>   But Ice officials said Saturday's appearance is likely to be Bol's
last with the team. Bol's arthritic feet began to swell inside his
custom-made ice skates, and after the first period he was out of
uniform and signing autographs.</TE>

<HD>A McEnroe of Squash? You Cannot Be Serious</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Admit it, you haven't thought about squash lately. Maybe squash for
Thanksgiving and how to get reluctant family members to eat it. But,
in all likelihood, not the sport.</LD>
<LD>   If all squash players were as controversial as Canadian Jonathon
Power, though, the game might easily pick up a larger following.</LD>
<LD>   Joe O'Connor of Canada's National Post newspaper conducted a
question-and-answer interview with Power last week, asking the John
McEnroe of squash whether he has misgivings about things he has said.</LD>
<TE>   Power: "You mean other than, 'Honey, you look fat in those jeans?'
Yeah, I've had a few. One time, I kind of pointed at the referee and
said, 'Somebody kill that guy.' That was kind of harsh."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Add Power trip: Apparently, fans in Boston treat him the way
Wimbledon used to regard McEnroe in his playing days, at least before
he used his rebel rep to his commercial benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "I am anti-squash-establishment," Power told O'Connor. "And the
Harvard crowd represents everything I want to destroy. I think squash
is a game everybody should be able to play, and it is in the rest of
the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is only elitist and Ivy League in North America -- more
so in the States than [in Canada] -- and it drives me crazy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What event did Spiridon Louis win at the 1896
Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Courting Bobby: New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick on Bobby
Knight's lawsuit against Indiana University for wrongful dismissal:
"Knight now asks a court to believe that he wasn't canned for being a
madman; that he just played one on TV. Even though he played himself.
Lost income? He exploited for financial gain what he habitually
denied -- his violent lunacy -- before and after he was fired.</TE>
<TE>   "And if the TV commercials in which he appeared as a
close-to-the-cliff raging lunatic are ruled admissible -- why
shouldn't they be? -- how can he claim that he was wrongfully sacked
and lost income as a result of being mistaken as a misanthrope? He
cashed in on that image, for crying out loud."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary and Barry show: Seattle Times columnist Steve Kelley's take
on the blossoming SuperSonic backcourt partnership of Gary Payton and
Brent Barry: "It takes a special person to play with Payton. It takes
a player whose ego isn't as large as the Staples Center. It takes a
two-guard who doesn't need the ball in his hands all of the time.
Paul Pierce couldn't play with Payton. Neither could Kobe or
Iverson."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Naked ambition: The recent nude poses by three female Romanian
gymnasts in a Japanese news magazine drew criticism from sports
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has a free will, but I believe they have stained the
image of the country," Adrian Stoica, secretary of the country's
gymnastics federation, told the daily newspaper Libertatea.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The marathon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Colorado treasurer Judy Van Gorden, on a $41,000
trust fund for Ralphie, the University of Colorado's buffalo mascot:</TE>
<TE>   "This will provide growing support for Ralphie in perpetuity --
not only for this Ralphie but all future Ralphies."</TE>

<HD>Sauer Keeps It Simple, Steady</HD>

<LD>Mighty Duck rookie defenseman Kurt Sauer has not been respecting his
elders.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit's Igor Larionov, a 41-year-old veteran of 12 seasons, set
up shop at the far post and waited in the third period of Friday's
game. The puck came his way from across the ice, but before it
arrived Sauer muscled Larionov out of the play.</LD>
<LD>   Just 18 games into the season, Sauer, who had never played higher
than juniors before, seems to have answered the question of whether
he can hack.</LD>
<TE>   "He's been really good for us," Coach Mike Babcock said. "We don't
even think about him as a coaching staff anymore. He's just a guy on
this team."</TE>
<TE>   Opinions have not changed about Sauer, 21. He is a minus-6 on the
season, but that number is a bit deceiving, as Sauer has had to skate
against the opposing team's top line many games.</TE>
<TE>   His skill was evident when he chased down Colorado's Peter
Forsberg on a third-period breakaway, forcing him into a bad shot, in
a 3-2 overtime victory Oct. 20.</TE>
<TE>   "He is steady and keeps thing simple," veteran defenseman Keith
Carney said. "It's a long year, but he has already done what a young
player needs to do, he got off to a good start."</TE>
<TE>   Sauer, however, shies away from such talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Eighteen games has just flown by," Sauer said. "I focus a little
on the positive, to keep myself up, but there are lots I still have
to work on. Every game I learn something."</TE>
<TE>   And what did he learn from Friday's game?</TE>
<TE>   "Luc Robitaille going by me in the slot, what, three times?" Sauer
said. "He was up on the blue line and I didn't know what to do."</TE>

<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   at Atlanta, 2 p.m. PST</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Philips Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 7-6-3-2, Thrashers 4-10-1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Thrashers (2001-02) -- 2-0-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Ducks have earned eight points in their last six
road games. They sit in third place in the Pacific Division. The
Ducks recalled goalie Martin Gerber from Cincinnati and sent goalie
Ilja Bryzgalov down. Gerber, who had been in Switzerland to visit his
ailing mother, had been sent to Cincinnati for one game to get back
up to speed.</TE>

<HD>Iowa Tries to Buck System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think of all an Ohio State loss would have meant.</LD>
<LD>   As the ball was juggled in the hands of an Illinois receiver, the
entire bowl season seemed up in the air.</LD>
<LD>   But Ohio State -- No. 1 in the BCS standings but sinking fast in
almost everyone's true estimation -- survived an upset bid Saturday
after the Illini's Walter Young failed to control an overtime pass in
the end zone before falling out of bounds.</LD>
<TE>   It was one of two close calls in the end zone as Illinois tried to
match Ohio State in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   But the Buckeyes held on for a 23-16 victory that leaves them only
a victory over Michigan Saturday from playing for the national
championship in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3 -- no matter how many
people think they're not one of the best two teams in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Had Ohio State lost, the implications would have been wide.</TE>
<TE>   Besides assuring that a one-loss team would play for the national
title, it would have put Iowa in the Rose Bowl as Big Ten champion
and moved USC a little bit closer to Pasadena. (Washington State
would have been a threat to move from No. 3 in the BCS standings to
No. 2 and a place in the title game, giving USC another avenue to the
Rose Bowl besides taking care of its own business and hoping
Washington State loses its final two games.)</TE>
<TE>   And considering that visiting Iowa fans in Minneapolis tore down
one goal post at the Metrodome and tried to carry an upright out of
the stadium after the Hawkeyes' 45-21 victory over Minnesota clinched
a mere tie for the Big Ten title, Iowa fans might have stormed the
Mall of America if Ohio State had lost, thereby guaranteeing the
Hawkeyes a trip to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen 25,000 of the opposing team's fans at a home
game," Minnesota quarterback Asad Abdul-Khaliq said of the
half-Hawkeye crowd of 65,184. "That just shows the type of team
they've had. If I was an Iowa fan, I'd go anywhere, too."</TE>
<TE>   The big boost to Iowa's Rose Bowl prospects, surprisingly, came in
Lubbock, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech's 42-38 upset of Texas will drop the two-loss Longhorns
from the picture, and they had been a threat to block an Iowa-Rose
Bowl match.</TE>
<TE>   (Among the minutiae of the BCS rules is a provision that a team
that finishes third or fourth in the BCS standings but doesn't win
its conference is guaranteed one of the two at-large berths. If Texas
earned one, and with Notre Dame guaranteed the other if it finishes
in the top six, that would have boxed out Iowa even though Rose Bowl
officials suggest they plan to choose Iowa over Notre Dame if given
the option.)</TE>
<TE>   Pshew, that's another one of those paragraphs that makes a playoff
system sound great.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, all those distant Iowa relatives who live in Long
Beach -- once known as Iowa-by-the-Sea -- might want to get the sofa
bed ready.</TE>
<TE>   The Hawkeyes are probably headed West, but give it an asterisk:
There's still a chance Iowa could be boxed out of an at-large berth.</TE>
<TE>   One thing about Iowa is certain: The Hawkeyes are already in the
clubhouse at 11-1 with their regular season complete, and they don't
figure to be going anywhere but up from their No. 6 BCS ranking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Over-Talkative</TE>
<TE>   The pregame preparations for rivals Oregon and Washington included
a lot of verbal calisthenics.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon safety Keith Lewis called Washington quarterback Cody
Pickett "overrated."</TE>
<TE>   All Pickett did was pass for 316 yards and four touchdowns and
break the Pac-10 single-season passing yardage record in Washington's
42-14 victory.</TE>
<TE>   There's plenty of bad blood left for next season. The day before
the game, Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti responded to Washington Coach
Rick Neuheisel's claim he meant it as a compliment when he called
Oregon a "propaganda machine," saying he didn't consider it a
compliment at all.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I did not," Bellotti said. "Propaganda in my mind usually has
something to do with untruths, and all we do here is tell the truth
about the record and everything else."</TE>
<TE>   That record, after the blowout loss to the Huskies, is 7-4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Happy Returns</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky's Derek Abney set an NCAA record with his sixth kick
return for a touchdown this season -- this one a 95-yard kickoff
return against Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   Abney, a 5-foot-10, 175-pound junior, has returned four punts and
two kickoffs for touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Under the Knife</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee receiver Kelley Washington, who almost made himself
available for the NFL draft after last season, will have surgery next
week to fuse two vertebrae.</TE>
<TE>   Washington played in only two games because of injuries but had 23
catches for 443 yards. He had 64 receptions for 1,010 yards last
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Upset of the Day</TE>
<TE>   Defending NCAA Division I-AA champion Montana had its winning

<HD>No KO, but Morales Wins Title</HD>
<DH>He batters Ayala to get unanimous decision and regain WBC
featherweight championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>It is tough enough to go eyeball to eyeball with Erik Morales and see
that fearsome right hand coming your way, a guided missile of flesh
and bone.</LD>
<LD>   So imagine how terrifying it was for Paulie Ayala on Saturday
night at the Mandalay Bay Events Center. He was trying to battle
Morales for the World Boxing Council featherweight title with one
eyeball rendered useless.</LD>
<LD>   It might not have made any difference if Ayala had 20/20 vision,
but with his left eye beginning to swell in the third round, Ayala
became little more than a punching bag in the closing rounds as
Morales won a unanimous decision in front of a crowd of 7,028.</LD>
<TE>   Judges Burt Clements and John Keane both scored it 117-111, judge
Anek Hongtongkam 116-112. The Times scored it 116-112 for Morales.</TE>
<TE>   In a fight in which 1,813 punches were thrown, Morales landed 422
to only 185 for Ayala. The jabs were incredibly one-sided, Morales
connecting on 110 to 17 for Ayala.</TE>
<TE>   "This fight was called Never Surrender," said Ayala, who dropped
to 34-2 with 12 knockouts, "and I was never going to quit. The people
got their money's worth.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my toughest fight. He was catching me on the end of his
punches."</TE>
<TE>   Morales was coming off a loss to Marco Antonio Barrera in June,
his only defeat on a record which now stands at 42-1 with 31
knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   With the victory, however, he wins back the title he lost to
Barrera. Rather than pay the WBC's sanctioning fee, Barrera had
refused to accept it.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's fight was billed as Morales' power against Ayala's
speed and mobility, and it ran true to form. When Morales stayed
outside and used his reach advantage (72 inches to 66), he was able
to pound Ayala at will.</TE>
<TE>   When Ayala was able to weather Morales' punishing right and
stinging jabs and make his way inside, he was able to score points.</TE>
<TE>   But once Morales was convinced Ayala, whose biggest weakness has
always been the lack of a knockout punch, couldn't hurt him, he waded
in, looking for the blow that would end the fight early.</TE>
<TE>   It never came, although referee Kenny Bayless appeared to be close
to stopping the match in the closing minute of the fight when Ayala,
his left eye swollen shut, slumped against the ropes and took some of
Morales' best shots.</TE>
<TE>   After the final bell, Ayala was taken to Valley Hospital to have
the eye examined.</TE>
<TE>   Morales, who promised a knockout, gave reporters a list of reasons
why he failed.</TE>
<TE>   "I had trouble making weight," he said. "I hurt my left hand early
in the fight and I hurt my right hand late in the fight when I hit
[Ayala] on the top of the head."</TE>
<TE>   But finally he conceded the real reason Ayala was still upright at
the end.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a strong fighter," Morales said, "with a strong chin."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the semi-main event, Guty Espadas won a split decision over
Bones Adams to capture another of boxing's dubious titles, the WBC
Continental Americas featherweight championship.</TE>
<TE>   Judges Herbert Minn (115-114) and Jerry Roth (115-113) scored the
fight for Espadas. Judge Duane Ford gave it to Adams, 115-113.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Sabbath observant, orthodox Jew, super-lightweight Dmitriy
Salita (9-0, 7 knockouts) would not enter the ring until after dark
for a four-round preliminary fight.</TE>
<TE>   But it took only 1 minute 25 seconds for him to put his opponent's
lights out. Salita knocked Ron Gladden (11-7-1, 6) down twice in that
span, the first time with a flurry of punches culminating with a left
hook.</TE>

<HD>Jacobs in Tune at Dana Point</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Thorpe and John Jacobs have been friends for too many years to
count. They've played hundreds of practice rounds together and shared
more than a few bottles of whiskey. But when the cigar-smoking tandem
teamed up for the Hyundai Team Matches on Saturday at Monarch Beach
Golf Links in Dana Point, Thorpe learned something new about his
Champions Tour buddy.</LD>
<LD>   "He made a birdie putt at No. 9 and he started singing," Thorpe
said. "I never knew he could sing until he made that birdie putt."</LD>
<LD>   Jacobs and Thorpe made beautiful music together for most of the
back nine, birdied the 16th and 17th holes and defeated Doug Tewell
and Bruce Lietzke, 2 and 1. They will play defending champions Allen
Doyle and Dana Quigley in the Champions Tour final today. Doyle and
Quigley defeated Bruce Fleisher and David Graham, 3 and 1.</LD>
<TE>   The winners will get $100,000 each plus a new car. The
second-place finishers get $50,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to playing those guys," said Thorpe, who said he
would fly to Las Vegas Saturday night and return for this morning's
final. "We're gonna stick it to them a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Fred Couples and Mark Calcavecchia, defending champions of the PGA
Tour matches, reached the final with a 5-and-4 victory over Peter
Jacobsen and Scott McCarron. Calcavecchia had five birdies in eight
holes starting at No. 4, but credited a Couples birdie at No. 9 for
turning the match around. Couples and Calcavecchia led, 2-up, after a
McCarron birdie on No. 8, but Couples drained a slick 12-footer to
give the team a 3-up lead at the turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you lose a hole, you want to get it back," Calcavecchia
said.</TE>
<TE>   Couples and Calcavecchia will play Rich Beem and Peter Lonard in
the final. Beem and Lonard defeated Jerry Kelly and Chris Smith, 3
and 2.</TE>
<TE>   In the LPGA matches, defending champions Lorie Kane and Janice
Moodie defeated Grace Park and Beth Bauer, 4 and 3, to put defending
champions in all three finals. Kane and Moodie will play Dottie
Pepper and Juli Inkster, 2 and 1 winners over Laura Diaz and Heather
Bowie. Pepper and Inkster won four consecutive team matches before
losing to Park and Wendy Ward in the first round last year.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MANHATTAN, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Quarterback Ell Roberson ran for 228 yards -- the most ever by a
Kansas State quarterback -- and three touchdowns in 29 carries and
the 11th-ranked Wildcats handed Nebraska another humiliating loss,
49-13, on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Darren Sproles had a 70-yard touchdown run, his third scoring run
of the game, to finish off Kansas State's most lopsided victory
against the Cornhuskers. It also gave Sproles 155 yards, his seventh
consecutive 100-yard game rushing and eighth of the season. Josh
Scobey set the school record last season with seven 100-yard games.</LD>
<LD>   Roberson's 91-yard first-quarter touchdown run was the
second-longest run against Nebraska, topped only by Gale Sayers'
99-yarder for Kansas in 1963.</LD>
<TE>   "It looked like the Red Sea," Roberson said. "I spotted the goal
line and I just ran away."</TE>
<TE>   With one game left, against Colorado, Nebraska (7-5 overall, 3-4
in the Big 12) is assured of its first non-winning conference record
since its 3-4 Big Eight mark in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskers' five regular-season losses are the most since the
1961 team went 3-6-1, and Saturday's loss dropped their road record
against ranked teams to 1-7 under Coach Frank Solich. Kansas State is
9-2, 5-2.</TE>

<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>Rookie-initiation dinners in today's NHL, similar to the one where
King prospect Joe Corvo was arrested early Wednesday morning in
Boston, usually are not the ribald affairs that once were
commonplace.</LD>
<LD>   No longer are first-year players shaved from head to toe by their
teammates, nor are they taped naked to chairs in hotel elevators.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, rookies are simply stuck paying the tab for dinner and
drinks at an expensive team meal at an upscale restaurant, as Michael
Cammalleri, Andreas Lilja, Jaroslav Bednar and Alexander Frolov were
last Sunday for the Kings' rookie-initiation dinner in Toronto, to
the tune of about $10,000.</LD>
<TE>   "You've got to be smart about it," captain Mattias Norstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Corvo, 25, allegedly punched, kicked and sexually assaulted a
34-year-old woman Wednesday in Boston, where the Manchester [N.H.]
Monarchs, the Kings' American Hockey League team, were celebrating
rookie-initiation night. The team reportedly had been bar hopping
before the alleged altercation at 1:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Corvo pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adam Deadmarsh, who suffered a concussion Tuesday night on a
third-period hit by Aki Berg of the Toronto Maple Leafs, sat out
Saturday night's game against the Edmonton Oilers, his second
consecutive game out of the lineup.</TE>

<HD>Cammalleri Breaks Through</HD>
<DH>He scores the first goal of his career in Kings' 4-1
victory over Oilers after Murray's aunt asks coach to give the rookie
forward more playing time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EDMONTON, Canada</DL>
<LD>As long as he plays in the NHL, Michael Cammalleri might never score
an easier goal than his first.</LD>
<LD>   The rookie from the University of Michigan, camped on the right
side of the net just outside the crease, took a sweet pass through
the slot from Brad Chartrand and whipped the puck into the net from
about two feet out Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   "Like an alley-oop," Cammalleri said.</LD>
<TE>   The second-period goal helped the Kings to a 4-1 victory over the
Edmonton Oilers in front of 16,461 at the Skyreach Centre.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Laperriere, Jaroslav Modry and Ziggy Palffy also scored and
Felix Potvin stopped 17 shots for the Kings, who ended a three-game
losing streak and won for only the third time in nine games since
Jason Allison was sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   For Modry, the goal was his seventh in nine games. For Palffy, who
scored into an empty net with 24 seconds to play, it was his first
since opening night.</TE>
<TE>   But nobody was happier than Cammalleri, unless it was Bernice
Hucal of Wetaskiwin, Canada, whose nephew is King Coach Andy Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Aunt Bernice called Murray about 90 minutes before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "She belongs to a hockey pool of senior ladies in Wetaskiwin,"
Murray said. "She said, 'Would you start playing that Cammalleri a
little bit more? He's in my pool.' So he got some ice time and he
contributed. I have to credit my aunt for that."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cammalleri: "Thanks to Andy's aunt. I appreciate that."</TE>
<TE>   Equal credit at least should go to Chartrand, who took a cross-ice
pass from Palffy in the left faceoff circle and patiently passed up a
clear shot of his own before slipping the puck back to the other side
in front of goaltender Tommy Salo.</TE>
<TE>   "My sister might have maybe hit the post on that one," Chartrand
said, smiling, of the shot he created. "But any hockey player would
have put it in. But Mike was in the right spot. That's what it's all
about -- position."</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri, who started the season in the minors after giving up
his senior year of eligibility at Michigan, has played well in five
games for the Kings but had not contributed any points after
collecting an assist in his first game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was starting to grip the stick a little bit, hoping one would
finally get in there," he said, "so it was really nice to get it out
of the way."</TE>
<TE>   The goal gave the Kings a 2-1 lead with 1:23 to play in the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   The Oilers had scored first, defenseman Janne Niinimaa netting his
fourth goal of the season off a rebound in the game's fifth minute.
But the Oilers, 5-0 winners on Friday night over the St. Louis Blues,
were shut down by Potvin and the defense-minded Kings over the last
55 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't give them space to generate their speed," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   Laperriere pulled the Kings even at 8:32 of the first period,
scoring on a shot from the slot while falling face-first to the ice.</TE>
<TE>   After Cammalleri gave them the lead for good, the Kings added two
goals in the final 20 minutes, the first by Modry at 4:29 of the
third period with Todd Marchant of the Oilers in the penalty box for
hooking Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   With Bryan Smolinski providing a screen in front, Modry's shot
from the right point banged off the inside of the left post and into
the net.</TE>
<TE>   "That puck has seeing eyes for him right now, doesn't it?" Murray
said of Modry, who is tied with Nicklas Lidstrom of the Detroit Red
Wings for most goals by a defenseman. "Obviously, a key goal in the
hockey game."</TE>

<HD>Martin Loses Appeal on NASCAR Penalty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Martin's appeal of a 25-point penalty was turned down Saturday,
making his bid to overtake Tony Stewart for the Winston Cup
championship that much tougher.</LD>
<LD>   Martin was docked the points for using an unapproved spring in his
car in the Nov. 3 race at Rockingham, N.C. His Roush team argued that
the infraction was not intentional and that the penalty was too
severe.</LD>
<LD>   "This was an unbelievable situation that in a championship hunt, a
penalty on a nonperformance issue might come into play," Roush team
President Geoff Smith said.</LD>
<TE>   Martin will go into the season-closing Ford 400 today at
Homestead-Miami Speedway trailing Stewart by 89 points. Stewart will
win the championship if he finishes 22nd or better, no matter what
Martin does in the race.</TE>
<TE>   A three-person panel from the National Stock Car Racing Commission
also denied appeals of team owner Jack Roush's 25 car-owner points
penalty and crew chief Ben Leslie's $5,000 fine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stewart ran into trouble in the garage area at Homestead, bumping
a photographer with a forearm.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR said Stewart apologized for what the driver called an
accident, and the apology was accepted by the photographer, Rusty
Jarrett of Getty Images.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart is on probation for punching a photographer after an
August race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Smooth-running Steve Ostling of Corona won the 50-lap main event
at Perris Auto Speedway, winning the Sprint Car Racing Assn.'s sixth
Jack Kindoll Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Ostling won his second event this season and his first Kindoll
Classic after taking the lead on Lap 30 and holding off Charles Davis
Jr., of Buckeye, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Ostling started fourth, and Davis fifth, which was nothing
compared to the Torrance duo of Rickie Gaunt and Mike Kirby.</TE>
<TE>   Gaunt, who finished third, started the race in 13th position, and
Kirby, who finished fourth, started in 17th. Mike Spencer of Temecula
finished fifth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scott Wimmer, capitalizing when leader Jason Keller ran out of
gas, coasted by to win the Ford 300, the Busch Series season finale,
at Homestead-Miami Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Hank Parker Jr., who lost his sponsor last week, finished second
and Joe Nemechek was third. Greg Biffle, who wrapped up the series
title last week at Phoenix, was fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite losing more teams and drivers, CART series officials
promised exciting new drivers, closer races and at least one new team
in 2003 as they prepared to close out the year in Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see a whole different level of competition on the
racetrack," CART President Chris Pook said during the final day of
qualifying for today's Mexico Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   Bruno Junqueira claimed the pole position with the fastest time on
both days of qualifying in his Lola-Toyota. Christian Fittipaldi will
start beside him and Dario Franchitti qualified third.</TE>
<TE>   The CART losses next season include this year's champion
Christiano da Matta (to Formula One), engine builders Toyota and
Honda, and longtime CART team leaders such as Barry Green.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few of the 19 drivers are committed to return to CART next
year.</TE>

<LD>In the world of sports television, where declining ratings are the
norm, NASCAR is an anomaly. NASCAR has shifted into high gear and is
going in a different direction -- up.</LD>
<LD>   Football appears healthy again after some recent dips, but Fox had
record-low ratings for the World Series and NBC had record-low
ratings for the NBA last season.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, NASCAR has shown double-digit increases in the last two
years and a case can be made that stock car racing is the country's
second-most popular television sport, behind pro football.</LD>
<TE>   Fox is averaging 15.2 million viewers for its Sunday NFL
telecasts, and earlier this year averaged 9.4 million viewers for
NASCAR races.</TE>
<TE>   A PGA golf tournament averages 4.8 million viewers, a
regular-season NBA game 4.1 million and a regular-season baseball
game 3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   However, Los Angeles is not a NASCAR hotbed when it comes to
ratings. Although the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at Fontana in April drew
112,000 people, the TV rating was a 3.5.</TE>
<TE>   That pales in comparison to the 13 or 14 rating any NASCAR race
gets in such places as Greensboro and Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   The average NASCAR rating in L.A. this year is a 2.6.</TE>
<TE>   That ranks L.A. 47th among the nation's 55 largest markets, but
because of the size of the market, L.A. ranks second behind Atlanta
in number of households where NASCAR is being watched. Charlotte
ranks sixth and Greensboro is not in the top 10.</TE>

<HD>NASCAR's New Tack on Tech</HD>
<DH>The stock car racing circuit is leading the sports TV pack
by using satellite tracking to keep viewers up to speed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Normally, one wouldn't think the high-tech navigation system used in
competitive sailing would have anything to do with NASCAR stock car
racing.</LD>
<LD>   But there is a connection.</LD>
<LD>   In yachting, a satellite Global Positioning System, or GPS, is
used to determine a boat's position and performance, the drift of the
current. This information allows the navigator to compute the fastest
course.</LD>
<TE>   In NASCAR, the same tracking system is used in TV coverage to give
viewers each car's position, its speed and how many seconds it is
behind the leader.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that technology is provided by Sportvision of Mountain
View, Calif., a company co-founded by world-class yachting navigator
Stan Honey.</TE>
<TE>   Sportvision also provides the yellow first-down line used on
football telecasts by Fox, ABC and ESPN, and the K-Zone technology
ESPN used on baseball telecasts this season to track balls and
strikes.</TE>
<TE>   Honey and Bill Squadron founded Sportvision in 1998, while working
for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Honey, with a background in electrical engineering, is the brains
behind the technology. Squadron, who has a law degree, is more in
tune with the business side.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the technology sprang from Honey's love of sailing, his
skills as a navigator and his familiarity with GPS. He initially
excelled as a navigator in the age of charts and sextants, then
reestablished himself in the era of satellite weather information and
GPS.</TE>
<TE>   He has been the navigator for Roy Disney's several record-setting
races on the 75-foot maxi sled, Pyewacket, primarily in the Transpac
race from Los Angeles to Hawaii, and the roundtrip between Bermuda
and Newport, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Honey, who grew up in San Marino, was the executive vice
president for technology at News Corp. when David Hill, creative
chairman of Fox Sports, came to him and asked if there might be a way
to help TV viewers follow a hockey puck. Honey came up with the idea
for FoxTrax and supervised its development. It wasn't as well
received as the first-down line or K-Zone, but a new technical form
was born.</TE>
<TE>   One of Sportvision's newest toys is a super Telestrator TNT has
just begun using on NBA telecasts. It allows announcers to draw on
the screen without drawing on the players. It works on the same
principles as the first-down line.</TE>
<TE>   Squadron was at Staples Center when TNT televised the Lakers'
season opener against San Antonio. He gave a reporter a
behind-the-scenes tour and demonstrated how a line can be drawn or
placed on a screen and made to appear as though it were there
naturally.</TE>
<TE>   The key is the color coding. The yellow first-down line appears
only on the exact shade of green of the stadium's grass. It doesn't
appear on the players, creating an illusion that it runs beneath the
players.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a little trouble in the beginning," Squadron said. "It was
picking up the green in Green Bay Packer jerseys and Philadelphia
Eagle jerseys, and a few times the line went across the players."</TE>
<TE>   That's why the color has to be exact.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the line looks so good, people have been fooled into
thinking it exists.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had to explain that the line is not on the field," Honey
said. "We have to explain it's virtual imaging."</TE>
<TE>   Squadron said the technology is more advanced in NASCAR than any
other sport.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because we can put a 10-pound box in a race car," he said.
"We can't put one on a human being."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR is thrilled with what Sportvision has done for stock car
racing.</TE>
<TE>   "The star of the show is the in-car camera," said Jeffrey Pollack,
the managing director of broadcasting and new media for NASCAR. "But
the data and graphics from Sportvision provide a nice supporting
cast."</TE>
<TE>   In-car cameras have been around since 1979, when CBS televised the
Daytona 500 for the first time. Benny Parsons, now an NBC
commentator, allowed his car to be equipped with an 80-pound camera.
These days, cars have three cameras, weighing a total of 18 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know any other sport that makes as much use of
Sportvision's technology as NASCAR," Pollack said. "They're part of
our network telecasts, part of nascar.com and part of our In-Car on
In Demand pay package."</TE>
<TE>   In-Car on In Demand, available only on digital cable, is a
seven-channel package that offers fans the opportunity to follow
their favorite driver's every move on a dedicated channel.</TE>
<TE>   It's the kind of technology that the NFL is looking at for its
Sunday Ticket pay package -- offering one game on several channels
with various camera angles.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, when it comes to technology in sports television,
NASCAR is the leader.</TE>

<HD>Johnson, Hampton Are Part of Trade</HD>

<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catcher Charles Johnson reversed his decision and approved a trade to
the Colorado Rockies, his agent said Saturday, clearing the way for a
six-player deal that sends left-hander Mike Hampton to the Florida
Marlins.</LD>
<LD>   Hampton might not stay in Florida for long. A lawyer familiar with
the situation told Associated Press on condition of anonymity that
the Marlins were working on a deal that would send Hampton to the
Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   Brave General Manager John Schuerholz and Hampton's agent, Mark
Rodgers, declined to comment. Marlin General Manager Larry Beinfest
did not immediately return a phone call.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, who had used his no-trade rights to block the deal
earlier Saturday, changed his mind after getting an additional $1
million to make up for the fact that there is no state income tax in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "We got some tax elements taken care of in the transfer, so the
monetary element would remain the same in Colorado," agent Scott
Boras told Associated Press. "My understanding is that this was the
final step."</TE>
<TE>   Jay Alves, spokesman for the Rockies, said the deal was not quite
done.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson would go to Colorado along with outfielder Preston Wilson,
left-handed reliever Vic Darensbourg and second base prospect Pablo
Ozuna. Hampton and outfielder Juan Pierre would go to Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton signed an eight-year, $121-million contract with Colorado
in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has $25 million coming over the next three seasons and
Wilson is owed $27.5 million the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics traded right-hander Cory Lidle, their No. 4
starter the last two seasons, to the Toronto Blue Jays for two minor
leaguers. Lidle had an 8-10 record and a 3.89 earned-run average last
season.</TE>

<TE>   The New York Yankees signed an agreement establishing scouting and
marketing ties with the Yomiuri Giants, Japan's most popular and

<HD>Ohio State Survives Yet Another Scare</HD>
<DH>Buckeyes need overtime to defeat Illinois, 23-16, and keep
BCS title-game hopes alive. Michigan is the final obstacle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHAMPAIGN, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Battered but still unbeaten after another scare on the road, Ohio
State is one victory away from playing for its first national title
since 1968.</LD>
<LD>   And like always, Michigan is standing in the way.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the biggest game of the year. It's our archrival, and if we
win, we go to the Fiesta Bowl," linebacker Cie Grant said after
Saturday's 23-16 overtime victory over Illinois.</LD>
<TE>   The second-ranked Buckeyes, 12-0 overall and 7-0 in the Big Ten
Conference, nearly lost that rare opportunity against the Illini,
whose chance to spoil Ohio State's perfect season fell short when
Illinois quarterback Jon Beutjer had his final pass batted down at
the line of scrimmage in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State won the game on an eight-yard touchdown run by Maurice
Hall, one of two backs who filled in for injured freshman Maurice
Clarett.</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes improved to 12-0 for the first time in school
history, but to get into the national championship game on Jan. 3,
they'll have to defeat Michigan in Columbus next week. A Buckeye
victory would leave Ohio State and Iowa unbeaten in conference games.
They don't play each other this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody said winning the Big Ten championship would be easy," said
receiver Michael Jenkins, who had six catches for 147 yards and a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Especially against Michigan. The Wolverines ended Ohio State's bid
for perfect seasons in 1995 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get focused on Michigan, because we know if we
lose that, none of this means anything," Jenkins said.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second straight week the Buckeyes had struggled against
a team with a losing record. Ohio State trailed Purdue last week but
won, 10-6, when Jenkins caught a 37-yard touchdown pass with 1:36
left.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois (4-7, 3-4) came close to sending Saturday's game to a
second overtime, but Beutjer's third-down pass to Walter Young in the
end zone was ruled incomplete when the officials said that Young was
bobbling the ball when he went out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   Replays appeared to confirm that the officials made the right
call. Of course, Ohio State agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The one on our sideline, he was bobbling it. It's a good call,"
Buckeye Coach Jim Tressel said.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois sent the game to overtime tied at 16-16 when John Gockman
kicked a 48-yard field goal on the last play of regulation.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Redeems Itself, 52-41</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few days after John Mackovic's players nearly brought him down,
they hoisted their coach on their shoulders to celebrate the most
improbable development yet in Arizona's dramatic week.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Johnson passed for a school-record 492 yards and threw two
of his four touchdown passes to Justin Levasseur as Arizona ended a
six-game losing streak Saturday with a 52-41 victory over California
at Berkeley after a near-mutiny by half of Mackovic's team.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody was sure what to expect from the Wildcats (4-7 overall and
1-6 in the conference) this weekend after more than 40 players met
with university President Peter Likins on Tuesday night to express
their distaste for Mackovic's abrasive style and other concerns.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of resigning, as many university insiders thought he
would, Mackovic apologized for several mistakes during a tearful news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   "They showed unbelievable courage, character, heart, everything,"
said Mackovic, who got a brief postgame ride on two freshmen's
shoulders before hugging Athletic Director Jim Livingood. "I don't
think they'll ever forget this game. It will not necessarily be the
biggest victory they ever have, but it's something they'll use as a
lesson for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   There was little trace of any bad feelings in the visitors' locker
room at Memorial Stadium, where the players led a jubilant cheer that
brought tears to Johnson's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Wade caught 11 passes for a career-high 222 yards as the
Wildcats finished strong in a wacky victory over Cal (6-5, 3-4).</TE>
<TE>   Levasseur, a backup tight end who was one of Mackovic's biggest
detractors, caught his first two touchdown passes of the season,
including the go-ahead score with 12:37 left. Earlier this week,
Mackovic apologized to Levasseur for calling him "a disgrace to his
family."</TE>
<TE>   "Coach said this was our game, and we should play for ourselves,"
said Levasseur, a native of nearby Antioch. "I always try to put on a
good show for my family, and they were all here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oregon State 31, Stanford 21 -- Steven Jackson rushed for 230
yards in 35 carries and scored a touchdown as the Beavers (7-4, 3-4)
rallied for a victory over the Cardinal (2-8, 1-6) at Palo Alto.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BLOOMINGTON, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Larry Johnson outdid himself -- and every other running back in Penn
State history -- on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson rushed for 327 yards, a career-high four touchdowns and
shattered a 31-year-old school rushing record as he led the
16th-ranked Nittany Lions to a 58-25 Big Ten Conference victory over
Indiana.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson broke his own single-game school rushing record for the
third time this season and surpassed Penn State's single-season
record midway through the second quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Lydell Mitchell set the previous mark of 1,567 in 1971. Johnson
also passed John Cappelletti and Ki-Jana Carter, and finished the
game with 1,736 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The 327 yards was the fifth-best performance in Big Ten history
and the second best this season behind Ronnie Mixon of Central
Michigan, who had 377 against Eastern Michigan on Nov. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson displayed his power and explosiveness on touchdown bursts
of 69, 43, one and 41 yards as Penn State improved to 8-3 overall and
4-3 in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana (3-8, 1-6) was outgained on the ground by Johnson,
327-275. He averaged 11.7 yards in 28 carries.</TE>

<LD>The wreckage of a fifth consecutive victim still smoldering, several
USC Trojans paused on the littered landscape Saturday night to create
one more rubber-necking scene.</LD>
<LD>   They were all defensive players.</LD>
<LD>   And they were all signing autographs.</LD>
<TE>   Melvin Simmons scribbled on a child's program. Bernard Riley wrote
on a young man's back.</TE>
<TE>   Kenechi Udeze clutched a tiny pen in his giant, taped hand and
shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't done this very much," he said, smiling, pausing.
"Actually, I've never done this at all."</TE>
<TE>   If it wasn't official before the Trojans' 34-13 victory over
Arizona State, it's official now.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to Knock Them On Their Tails and Backs U.</TE>
<TE>   If holding the nation's eighth-ranked passing offense to fewer
than 300 yards passing with two interceptions doesn't convince you
...</TE>
<TE>   If holding the Sun Devils to fewer points in one game than they
scored in one quarter last week isn't enough ...</TE>
<TE>   If holding them to one yard on seven plays inside the Trojan
30-yard line in the second half won't work ...</TE>
<TE>   Then maybe this will:</TE>
<TE>   At halftime, trailing, 20-10, the Sun Devil offensive linemen
approached Coach Dirk Koetter with an unusual request.</TE>
<TE>   Could they please use a no-huddle offense the rest of the game?</TE>
<TE>   They felt it was the only way they could slow USC's relentless
defensive push and counter its adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   Koetter knew it might be trouble. There are certain plays they had
not practiced without a huddle.</TE>
<TE>   He also figured he had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Our players thought it would slow down their rush," he said,
shrugging.</TE>
<TE>   One look at quarterback Andrew Walter staggering off the field
with his shoulder pads around his ears would later indicate that it
did not.</TE>
<TE>   When it was used in the second half, the no-huddle became the
all-muddle, leading to all sorts of foolishness.</TE>
<TE>   This included Melvin Simmons' game-clinching interception,
assisted by a Sun Devil receiver who didn't run the right play.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, the Trojans not only got into their wallets, they got into
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is going to beat us if we play our game," crowed Marcell
Allmond as he walked off the field.</TE>
<TE>   That game is now clearly defense, which wins championships and
saves seasons and changes everything.</TE>
<TE>   Under Pete Carroll, USC has finally figured that out, and just in
time, as the Trojans stalk into what could be their most important
two-game stretch in 15 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   They are ranked eighth, probably about to move up to at least
seventh, their highest approval rating this late in the season since
the quarterback was Rodney Peete.</TE>
<TE>   They have a chance to sneak a Rose Bowl bid while snatching a
Heisman Trophy for Carson Palmer, two long-odds deals, but possible
nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   All that is stopping them?</TE>
<TE>   Games against nothing-to-lose UCLA and loaded-for-BCS Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't this fun?" asked Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever.</TE>
<TE>   If the Mike Williams-hobbled offense suffers more lapses like
Saturday's, the Trojans' best hope can be found in a defensive game
plan that was deciphered by Koetter only after the band began
marching up the tunnel by his locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "They changed coverages, they blitzed, they played straight man,
they played zone ... " he said, his voice trailing off.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, pounding drums were heard outside the interview
room.</TE>
<TE>   He closed his eyes, placed his fingers on his temples, and shook
his head.</TE>
<TE>   Um, coach? Those were your drums.</TE>
<TE>   The USC band didn't march through the tunnel until Walter was
speaking, but he didn't seem to mind the noise, perhaps because he
had spent the previous three hours being drowned out.</TE>
<TE>   "They obviously have good coaching," he said of the USC defense.
"They forced a lot of questionable throws."</TE>
<TE>   Leading to a couple of unquestionably impressive statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season at Oregon, Walter set a Pac-10 record by
throwing for 536 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, he threw for barely half that.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season against Stanford, Walter threw five touchdown
passes.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, he threw one, and only in the final minute of the first
half on a busted coverage that left Shaun McDonald wide open.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most fun I've ever had," said Allmond, the former
receiver who has found a new home at cornerback. "We do something new
every play. Everybody gets involved. We keep coming and coming."</TE>
<TE>   Or, in the words of Carroll, "I like to think you've got to defend
every player on our defense."</TE>
<TE>   For example, USC had six tackles for losses ... by six players ...
playing four positions ... including cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   All this on a day when the entire Coliseum crowd never chanted
"de-fense, de-fense."</TE>
<TE>   Which, come to think of it, the Trojans should take as a
compliment.</TE>
<TE>   By now, apparently, it's assumed.</TE>

<HD>Martz's Response to Bulger Is Kurt</HD>
<DH>Despite leading Rams to four victories in a row, former
backup will be replaced by Warner after Monday's game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The night before last Sunday's game against San Diego, a message
popped up on St. Louis quarterback Marc Bulger's cell phone. It was
Dan Marino calling to wish him luck. Considering he and Marino went
to the same high school in Pittsburgh -- and, well, Marino might be
the greatest quarterback in NFL history -- Bulger returned the call
and thanked him via voicemail.</LD>
<LD>   Then, instead of waiting for a call back, Bulger turned off his
phone and went to bed.</LD>
<LD>   "I couldn't believe that," said Marc's father, Jim, a former Notre
Dame quarterback. "It was Danny Marino. And Marc was turning off his
phone? I would have slept with that thing under my pillow."</LD>
<TE>   Thing is, Bulger doesn't need the strokes. He appreciates the kind
words, mind you, he just doesn't need them to know he's the hottest
quarterback this side of Brett Favre. After taking his first NFL snap
a month ago, Bulger has directed the resurgent Rams to four
consecutive victories and leads the league with a 107.4 passer
rating.</TE>
<TE>   Telephonically speaking, this kid is off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   But anyone can be put on hold, and that's exactly what the Rams
plan to do with Bulger after squeezing one more start out of him,
against Chicago on Monday night. Two-time NFL MVP Kurt Warner, out
with a broken pinkie since the first quarter of a Week 4 game against
Dallas, is ready to return to action.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real easy decision for me," Coach Mike Martz said last
week. "Kurt's our quarterback. I'm telling you, he is our
quarterback. Marc Bulger is outstanding, but Kurt is our
quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   The situation is remarkably reminiscent of what happened in New
England last season, when Patriot quarterback Drew Bledsoe went down
with an injury and unknown backup Tom Brady stepped in, ultimately
leading the team to a Super Bowl victory over Martz's Rams.</TE>
<TE>   But the decision of New England Coach Bill Belichick was an
unusual one. In most cases, a coach gives the job back to his
recuperated star. That was the case with the 1972 Miami Dolphins,
when Bob Griese returned to the starting lineup after Earl Morrall
quarterbacked the team to 10 consecutive regular-season and playoff
victories. It was Griese who put the finishing touches on that
magical romp, though, leading the Dolphins over Washington in Super
Bowl VII and the only unbeaten season in league history.</TE>
<TE>   But few comparisons can be made between those Dolphins and these
Rams, who opened the season 0-5. Warner struggled through his first
three-plus games, throwing one touchdown with eight interceptions.
The Rams had their chances to win some of those games, however, and
the offensive line was as porous as any in the league. Backup
quarterback Jamie Martin started one game after Warner was injured
but wound up on the sideline with a twisted knee.</TE>
<TE>   Warner is ready to come back, and will do so next Sunday at
Washington, yet he toiled as a backup long enough to grasp the
sensitivity of the situation. When asked about replacing Bulger, he
winces.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a no-win situation," he said. "They want you to either
criticize Marc or walk around and brag about yourself, and I'm not
going to do either one of those things. You let the questions and
rumors and controversy fly, but you know what the bottom line is at
the end of the day and you stand on that."</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, 25, is getting a quick lesson in rumor-ology. Sunday
night, after he threw two touchdown passes in the final 3:06 to beat
the Chargers, 28-24, Bulger learned of a simmering scandal. A TV
camera appeared to catch Bulger shoving Warner on the sideline after
the game-winning touchdown toss. What were they hiding? Where was the
love?</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, it was there all along. The shover was former Ram
quarterback Paul Justin, who was standing on the sideline in street
clothes, and it was a playful push, as if to say, "OK, Kurt, it's
your turn to congratulate him." Bulger heard about it hours later
when Rick Smith, the team's director of public relations, called to
investigate the rumors.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally saw it Monday on the news," Bulger said three days
after the shove-that-wasn't. "I tried to get ahold of Kurt to make
sure he didn't think it was anything, and I couldn't get ahold of
him. We saw each other [Tuesday] for the first time, and he basically
said the same thing I was saying: 'I don't know why people are making
an issue of it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Then again, this is Bulger's first go-round under the microscope
of fame. He was a sixth-round selection by New Orleans in the 2000
draft -- 31 picks ahead of New England's Brady -- but didn't take a
snap for the Saints in an exhibition game, or even in practice. They
released him in training camp.</TE>
<TE>   He drove home to Pittsburgh, but didn't consider giving up on his
dream.</TE>
<TE>   "Until I got an opportunity, I wasn't going to sell myself short,"
said Bulger, who set 25 passing records at West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Later that season, after Warner broke his pinkie the first time,
the Rams signed Bulger and put him on the practice squad. They had
kept tabs on him for a while -- Martz interviewed him for 2 1/2 hours
at the NFL combine -- but they weren't looking to draft a
quarterback. He lasted with the Rams for a week, then was released.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Atlanta signed him and also put him on the practice
squad, where he spent two weeks. The season was nearing an end, and
the Falcons liked what they saw in Bulger. One day, they called him
at his apartment and asked him to come to the facility to meet with
Coach Dan Reeves, who was ready to sign him to a longer deal.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Bulger made the phone call that changed his life. He
dialed his dad and asked for his advice. Jim Bulger reminded his son
what the Rams told Marc: Call us before you sign with anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   Marc was almost at Falcon headquarters, so he let his dad make the
call to St. Louis. Martz got on the phone, as did Ram President Jay
Zygmunt -- a classmate of Jim's at Notre Dame -- and they promised to
offer Marc a contract the day after Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Jim hurried to call his son back, gave him the news and let Marc
decide. He chose the Rams, then had to walk in and break the news to
Reeves.</TE>
<TE>   Jim said the Atlanta coach "wasn't a happy camper."</TE>
<TE>   But Marc was, especially on Dec. 26 when an express-mail package
arrived with a two-year Ram contract inside. Finally, a ray of
certainty broke through Bulger's foggy future.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jim: "There was a little sigh of relief in the Bulger house."</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the calls he gets, it's a wonder Bulger ever turns off
his phone.</TE>

<HD>Coliseum Leaves NFL, Trojans Feeling Empty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The push is still on to convince the NFL that the Coliseum is the
place to play its games, and the folks who promote the Coliseum peg
their argument around the USC experience.</LD>
<LD>   This might explain why no one in the NFL has any interest in the
Coliseum, because if it's anything like the USC experience, then it's
only a reminder to NFL owners of just how empty and depressing this
place can be.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   NOW I wouldn't want to go someplace where I'd have to sit next to
a USC fan either, so I can appreciate the every-other-seat occupied
look to the Coliseum when the game began, but an outsider might
wonder what it takes to draw a full house here.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans are ranked eighth best in the nation, playing a worthy
opponent with the same number of wins on a beautiful, clear Los
Angeles day, and USC -- if the Carson Palmer Heisman hype is to be
believed -- has the best player in the country throwing footballs all
around the place.</TE>
<TE>   But on homecoming Saturday, this place had a Raider-Arizona
Cardinal feel to it, and while the fans looked a lot more wholesome
and better dressed than the criminals the Raiders attracted, this was
no advertisement for the return of the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans announced a crowd of 73,923, which tells me those who
announced the attendance at the women's tennis tournament in Staples
Center got their education at USC. If USC counted 73,923 fans coming
through the turnstiles, 20,000 of them remained stuck in concession
lines and never made it to their seats.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's the Coliseum, and how it looks when not filled to
capacity, but -- like going to a crowded movie theater to enjoy a
good comedy with everyone else laughing -- there's a different feel
to a packed stadium, and that was missing here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'VE THOUGHT for some time now there aren't many Trojan fans.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, when the track was removed and more seats added to
bring the fans closer to the field, USC has played 59 home games in
the Coliseum but has attracted crowds of 60,000 or more only 19
times.</TE>
<TE>   Take away the large crowds for Notre Dame and UCLA, and the
Trojans have attracted more than 60,000 here 10 times in 10 years,
including Saturday's bogus count of 73,923.</TE>
<TE>   Now if you're going to talk about your program in the same
reverential tones as Notre Dame, Michigan and Tennessee, how do
Trojan fans explain their own sorry showing most of the time? On many
Saturdays, the 300 or 400 fans sitting in the end zone and rooting on
the opposition hold their own with Trojan fans.</TE>
<TE>   This Saturday should have been significantly different,
considering the backdrop. There is talk of USC playing in a bowl
championship series game. The Trojans are still in Rose Bowl
contention, having already won seven games. They've won their last
seven games in the Coliseum, sending everyone home happy. Coach Pete
Carroll is the picture of excitement. Senior USC safety Troy Polamalu
has gotten all kinds of TV and newspaper publicity. A couple of weeks
ago Arizona State was the surprise team in the Pac-10, and tied for
first place.</TE>
<TE>   So how do you explain USC emerging from the tunnel and not finding
a sold-out crowd going crazy?</TE>
<TE>   Throw in pregame hype in newspapers reporting Lisa Leslie, Tim
Salmon, Robert Horry and Pete Vagenas would be here for a halftime
ceremony to honor the Southern California-area champions, add the
horse, band and cheerleaders and what more does it take to attract
the casual L.A.-area football fan?</TE>
<TE>   But is this just the USC experience? The Coliseum? Would a
renovated Rose Bowl make a difference? Or is this Los Angeles, and
there's a message there for the NFL?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PALMER HAS had five or six great games in a row to cap off a
disappointing career that includes 47 interceptions, and now to
mention him in the same Heisman Trophy sentence as Miami quarterback
Ken Dorsey is ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, who is 35-1 in three seasons as Miami's starting
quarterback, led his team to a national championship last year and
has the Hurricanes undefeated this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   T. McKIMMEY e-mailed to say: "Do you know the NCAA has forbidden
the Notre Dame High School band of Sherman Oaks from playing at the
Notre Dame-USC game [in the Coliseum], where they have been playing
for many years? They say it is a recruiting violation."</TE>
<TE>   A USC spokesman said the school was unaware of any change in
plans, but since the University of Notre Dame invites the band to
play on its behalf, there might be a problem and USC has yet to be
told. I'm sure there's a lot of competition for Notre Dame High's
tuba player, but I'd hate to see this whole thing end on a sour note,
preventing him and his friends from attending a big-time football
event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GARY PLAYER is captain for "The Rest of the World" in its Warburg
Cup battle with the U.S. team led by Arnold Palmer, and in 1961,
Player won more money in 30 tournaments than any other player on the
tour -- $64,000. Each loser in the Warburg Cup competition today will
receive $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARIZONA'S WIN over Cal suggests that Coach John Mackovic's tearful
apology to his players earlier this week worked. If I'm Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry, the way things are going, I'd give it a try today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jim and Joyce Roberts:</TE>
<TE>   "T.J. Simers addressing the [San Fernando Valley Ventura County]
Trojan Booster Club? Please cancel our subscription."</TE>
<TE>   No need to panic. I survived -- to write, and trash USC again.</TE>

<HD>Texas Can't Solve Kingsbury</HD>
<DH>Texas Tech quarterback passes for 473 yards, six touchdowns
in 42-38 win, ending title hopes for No. 4 Longhorns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LUBBOCK, Texas</DL>
<LD>Texas had no answer for Kliff Kingsbury, and now there's no chance
for a Big 12 or national title.</LD>
<LD>   Kingsbury completed 38 of 60 passes for 473 yards and six
touchdowns against one of the nation's top defenses and Texas Tech
upset the fourth-ranked Longhorns, 42-38, on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "We tried everything and he whipped everything we tried," Texas
Coach Mack Brown said. "We're really disappointed, but give them
credit."</LD>
<TE>   While Kingsbury ended Texas' title hopes, he also lifted Texas
Tech (8-4 overall, 5-2 in the conference) into the Big 12 South race.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Raiders visit Oklahoma (9-1, 5-1) next Saturday, with the
winner taking the division and advancing to the Big 12 title game
Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to do the same like we did today" to beat Oklahoma,
Texas Tech Coach Mike Leach said. "We need to get a lot of first
downs, make good punts and complete passes."</TE>
<TE>   The defeat was another tough blow for Texas (9-2, 5-2).</TE>
<TE>   A loss to Oklahoma last month all but eliminated the Longhorns
from the conference race, but they still had an outside chance of
reaching the bowl championship series' national title game in the
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   "They all hurt anytime you lose," said Texas quarterback Chris
Simms, who threw for 345 yards and four touchdowns. "This one hurts a
lot. To be so close and have things fall the way they did, it's
tough."</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech went ahead, 42-38, on a 25-yard pass from Kingsbury to
Taurean Henderson with 5:41 left.</TE>
<TE>   Simms tried to lead Texas back, but Texas Tech safety Ryan Aycock
intercepted a pass intended for B.J. Johnson with 5:21 left to seal
the win.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to go in the middle, and I got bumped by a
linebacker," Johnson said. "By the time I got turned around in there,
Chris had already thrown the ball. The rest is history."</TE>
<TE>   With no timeouts left for Texas, Tech kept the ball on the ground
and got three first downs to run out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Texas is the highest-ranked team Texas Tech has ever beaten.</TE>
<TE>   Although Texas' defense began the game ranked fifth nationally,
giving up only 261 yards per game, Texas Tech had 306 yards by
halftime and finished with 606.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' defensive coordinator Carl Reese gave Kingsbury credit for
picking apart his schemes.</TE>
<TE>   "We played hard, but we didn't quite do it," Reese said. "We were
up against a hot quarterback, and my hat's off to him."</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 21-21, at halftime, Kingsbury opened the
third quarter with eight straight completions, among them a five-yard
scoring pass to Wes Welker, who had 247 all-purpose yards.</TE>

<HD>Trojan Focus Is Unrivaled</HD>
<DH>USC finally can look ahead to UCLA after Palmer, Fargas and
defense spark 34-13 victory over Arizona State.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So clear was the sky Saturday afternoon, fans in the upper rows of
the Coliseum got a spectacular panoramic view that engulfed the
downtown skyline and extended north to the San Gabriel Mountains.</LD>
<LD>   The Rose Bowl sits near the base of that range, but USC players
spent the last month refusing to look toward playing UCLA there until
they dispatched all other challengers.</LD>
<LD>   After defeating Arizona State, 34-13, before a homecoming crowd of
73,923, the eighth-ranked Trojans can finally turn their focus to the
Bruins.</LD>
<TE>   "We're done with them now," defensive tackle Bernard Riley said of
Arizona State. "It's rivalry time."</TE>
<TE>   USC extended its winning streak to five games and its home winning
streak to eight with a performance not as dominating as its previous
three. However, it was good enough to improve the Trojans to 8-2
overall and 6-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference. It also kept USC in
contention for a possible berth in the Rose Bowl or another bowl
championship series game.</TE>
<TE>   "We made it through and this has been a great challenge for us for
three weeks," USC Coach Pete Carroll said. "There are no issues about
[looking ahead] now."</TE>
<TE>   USC, which scored more than 40 points in consecutive victories
over Washington, Oregon and Stanford, needed fourth-quarter
touchdowns from running back Justin Fargas and quarterback Carson
Palmer to put away a Sun Devil team that had given up a combined 99
points in its previous two games.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State (7-5, 4-3) pulled to within 20-13 on Mike Barth's
27-yard field goal on the last play of the third quarter before USC
shut down the Sun Devils.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, we're just bombing people and throwing deep, long
balls," said Palmer, who completed 20 of 34 passes for 214 yards and
two touchdowns without an interception. "But Justin was running the
ball so well and the offensive line was blocking so great, we just
stayed with that."</TE>
<TE>   Fargas, the senior transfer from Michigan, appears to be growing
stronger as the season goes on. He carried 26 times for 125 yards and
got many of them after sustaining an initial hit. The Trojans
finished with a season-high 201 yards rushing and held the ball for
35 minutes 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "The more you carry the ball the more confident you get," Fargas
said. "We had a couple down times when we got a little sloppy, but
the offense bands together and we know we are going to get back on
track."</TE>
<TE>   The offense got a big lift from the defense, which neutralized
Arizona State quarterback Andrew Walter, forced three turnovers and
stopped the Sun Devils on a critical fourth-down play in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Walter, who passed for 477 yards in the previous game against
California, completed 24 of 49 passes for 297 yards and a touchdown.
But his longest completion covered 27 yards and Trojan safety DeShaun
Hill and linebacker Melvin Simmons intercepted passes.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew they'd change coverages a little, and they used blitz,
zone and man," Arizona State Coach Dirk Koetter said. "[Walter] got
frustrated. He made some throws he shouldn't have."</TE>
<TE>   USC came into the game having outscored opponents, 74-17, in the
third quarter, but Arizona State shut out the Trojans in the period.</TE>
<TE>   USC then showed the form that helped it outscore opponents, 94-63,
in fourth quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Starting at their 29, the Trojans drove to a touchdown in four
plays on the first possession. Fargas turned a short pass from Palmer
into a 33-yard gain and Palmer followed with a 31-yard pass to
flanker Keary Colbert. Fargas carried for four yards and then gave
the Trojans a 27-13 lead on a three-yard scoring run with 12:58 left.</TE>
<TE>   Josh Golden returned the ensuing kickoff 42 yards to give Arizona
State a first down at its 42-yard line. The Sun Devils moved to the
Trojan 36 on a 22-yard pass from Walter to Mike Pinkard before USC
clamped down.</TE>
<TE>   Junior running back Mike Williams gained a yard on first down.
Walter was sacked for a seven-yard loss by Simmons on second down,
and Walter completed a 15-yard pass to Shaun McDonald to make it
fourth and one at the Trojan 27.</TE>
<TE>   Walter handed off to Williams, who ran to his right before
cornerback Marcell Allmond and linebacker Mike Pollard combined for a
hit that stopped Williams for no gain with 10:15 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons ended another Sun Devil threat when he intercepted a pass
at the Arizona State 23 with 7:21 left.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just my time to step up," Simmons said. "Everyone on this
defense makes plays. We had to stop them from coming back and give
our offense another chance."</TE>
<TE>   USC needed five plays to put the game out of reach.</TE>
<TE>   Sultan McCullough, who broke free for a 59-yard gain that set up a
touchdown in the second quarter, carried for six yards. Fargas then
carried three times to advance the ball to the two, where Palmer
sneaked in for a 34-13 lead with 4:39 left.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman wide receiver Mike Williams caught only one pass, but it
resulted in an 18-yard touchdown in the first quarter, the seventh
consecutive game Williams has scored a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Holmes caught a two-yard touchdown pass and Ryan Killeen
kicked field goals of 20 and 41 yards as the Trojans took a 20-10
halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he was excited to finally start preparing for UCLA.
Last season, the Trojans shut out the Bruins, 27-0, for their third
consecutive victory over their rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "If we stay in line and keep walking that walk that we've been
walking all year, we should be all right," Carroll said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Klein's keys to the game, and how the Trojans measured up:</LD>
<LD>   1. Prevent the big play. Shaun McDonald scored on a 24-yard
touchdown pass for Arizona State, but the Trojans kept quarterback
Andrew Walter largely in check. Walter's longest completion covered
27 yards and the Sun Devils' longest run was 12.</LD>
<LD>   2. Contain Terrell Suggs. Junior tackle Jacob Rogers and freshman
tackle Winston Justice neutralized the nation's sack leader, who
finished with six tackles and was credited with half a sack.</LD>
<TE>   3. Avoid looking ahead. USC committed no turnovers and created
some when it needed to. Throughout the week, the Trojans repeated
that they would not start thinking about UCLA until the Sun Devils
were defeated. Now, it's hello, Bruins.</TE>

<LD>USC linebacker Melvin Simmons says the defense enters every game with
a goal: Hold the opponent to no more than 18 points.</LD>
<LD>   It didn't seem likely the Trojans could accomplish that feat
against Arizona State, which began Saturday's game averaging 34.4
points.</LD>
<LD>   But with the help of several big plays by USC's linebackers, the
Trojans were able to contain Sun Devil quarterback Andrew Walter and
frustrate one of the nation's most potent passing attacks en route to
a 34-13 vic- tory.</LD>
<TE>   "That's the way we approach it," Simmons said. "Maybe sometimes
teams are going to get some yards on us, but they're not going to
score over 18 points. If we do that, we feel we should win."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons and fellow linebackers Mike Pollard and Matt Grootegoed
made key contributions to a defensive effort that allowed Arizona
State to convert only three of 14 third-down opportunities and
neither of its two fourth-down tries.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a big statement," Pollard said.</TE>
<TE>   With USC leading, 27-13, Pollard teamed with cornerback Marcell
Allmond to stop tailback Mike Williams for no gain on fourth and one
from the USC 27 with 10:15 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been practicing all week on stopping that [play]," Pollard
said. "We all sprang to the running back.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything was perfect on that play."</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed, the Trojans' leading tackler for the season, recovered
a fumble by Walter on Arizona State's second possession to set up the
game's first touchdown, and he also had a sack.</TE>
<TE>   USC had four sacks for minus-31 yards and forced three turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   "The defense has to keep doing that," Pollard said. "We're the
dirty boys. We do the dirty work. The offense can get all the glory,
but we don't mind as long as we keep winning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though Justin Fargas continued to impress as the Trojans' No. 1
tailback, former starter Sultan McCullough made his presence felt as
well.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough rushed for 69 yards in four carries, including a
59-yard run in the second quarter to the Arizona State 17. He was
disappointed to be caught from behind by cornerback Brett Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I could have scored, but I didn't realize [Hudson] was so
close to me," McCullough said. "I took the wrong angle. You want to
finish, but it was cool. I stayed in that series and we still
scored."</TE>
<TE>   Three plays after McCullough's long run, Palmer completed a
two-yard scoring pass to tight end Alex Holmes for a 17-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC free safety DeShaun Hill stopped Arizona State's first drive
of the second half by making a diving interception in the Trojan end
zone. Walter's pass on third and 11 from the USC 27 was thrown a good
20 yards past any Sun Devil receiver.</TE>
<TE>   "[Cornerback] Darrell Rideaux did a great job of jamming the
receiver, and I was back there just reading the quarterback's eyes,"
Hill said. "I saw [Walter] turn and look and deliver the ball. I just
broke as hard as I could and was able to catch it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Tom Malone's 72-yard punt in the third quarter was the
longest for USC since John Stonehouse boomed a 76-yarder against
Washington State in 1994.... Kareem Kelly caught a pass in his 45th
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   -- Rob Fernas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Williams' ankle was sore enough to limit him to one
reception. But there was nothing wrong with his arm.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman receiver completed a pass to Keary Colbert for 19
yards on a trick play in the second quarter. Williams caught a
lateral toss from Carson Palmer, took two steps toward the line of
scrimmage and launched a left-handed toss down the sideline to
Colbert that helped set up a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to my left so I threw it with my left hand," said a
smiling Williams.</TE>
<TE>   His lone reception was good for an 18-yard touchdown that opened
the scoring five minutes into the game. It was the seventh
consecutive game Williams has caught a scoring pass and was his 11th
touchdown reception of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, Palmer's passes eluded his grasp.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the timing was off," he said. "Normally, Carson never
overthrows me. I was a step slow. I couldn't go as hard as I wanted
to."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is 69 yards receiving short of 1,000 and 43 short of
breaking the Pac-10 record for a freshman.</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Trojan women opened the college basketball season
with a win for the first time since 1999, defeating Northern Arizona
on Friday in the first round of the preseason Women's NIT. That was
the only home game guaranteed to USC for the rest of the tournament,
which resumes today against the Rams. Colorado State has won both
previous meetings, the most recent a 66-56 victory in the 2000
postseason WNIT. USC guard Aisha Hollans, who has been idled by a
sore back and an academic suspension, is finally cleared to play.
Colorado State defeated first-round opponent San Francisco on Friday,
making Chris Denker a winner in his Ram coaching debut. Senior
forward Ashley Augspurger led the Rams with 19 points.</TE>

Washington's 42-14 victory over No. 23 Oregon on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Pickett increased his total to 3,818 yards to surpass Ryan Leaf,
who threw for 3,637 yards for Washington State in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Pickett also has 305 completions this season to break Steve
Stenstrom's Pac-10 record of 300 for Stanford in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of him," Washington Coach Rick Neuheisel said. "But I
think he'd trade it all in for an unblemished record."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's win helped the Huskies, 6-5 overall and 3-4 in the
conference, avoid their first losing season since 1976. The Huskies
play Washington State next week in the Apple Cup.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks (7-4, 3-4) were ranked sixth after a 6-0 start, but
they've lost four of their last five. Oregon hadn't lost its home
finale in its previous nine seasons.</TE>

<HD>How Now, Yao?</HD>
<DH>Everyone wants a progress report on 7-5 Rocket rookie, who
is coming along slowly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Chinese are coming, the Chinese are coming.</LD>
<LD>   Not that anybody said it would be easy ... or fun ... or fast ...
or that it might not get embarrassing. Or, how do you say "crossover"
in Chinese, Cricket?</LD>
<LD>   Seven games into his NBA career, Yao Ming, the Houston Rockets'
7-foot-5, 296-pound Gift From the East, finds himself guarding the
Phoenix Suns' Stephon Marbury, who is a foot-and-a-half smaller but
has been using chumps like this all his life.</LD>
<TE>   Marbury crosses his dribble over from his left hand to his right
... then back to his left ... and that's -- oops -- one too many
reversals for Yao.</TE>
<TE>   Like a freshly harvested shock of wheat, he falls straight back
onto his rear end. Marbury goes on by while players on the Suns'
bench fall into each others' laps, convulsed in laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the next time Yao might figure out he has to drop back
an extra step. Meanwhile, when they venture into his vicinity, he'll
still be 7 foot 5 and they'll still just be whatever they are.</TE>
<TE>   As 6-8 Amare Stoudemire noted later, after getting toasted trying
to guard Yao, "He's tall."</TE>
<TE>   Yao is a lot of things, besides. As far as his NBA career goes, he
has only come out to warm up.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't easy being Yao, with the fate of his new team on his
shoulders, not to mention "SportsCenter's" nightly highlights,
Charles Barkley's big mouth, and the hopes of 1.2 billion countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   The way it works these days when prospects arrive at tender ages
from far-flung lands, everyone acknowledges that this will take time
... and then on day two, they want to know how he's doing so far ...
and in a week, if he hasn't fulfilled his potential, they're starting
to get impatient.</TE>
<TE>   While Yao might be on schedule, all things considered, even his
biggest fans think this is going kind of slowly</TE>
<TE>   "I think some Chinese are a little disappointed," says Yang Yi, a
correspondent for the Beijing Youth Daily, who is traveling with the
Rockets.</TE>
<TE>   "You see here [noting the game notes before the Rockets play the
Suns on Friday], Yao Ming is averaging 3.3 points and 3.7 rebounds.
But I think Chinese people know they have to be patient for half a
season."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is America's game, so sophistication runs higher
here ... or not.</TE>
<TE>   Before the draft, Barkley, Turner's human-cannonball analyst,
recommended that the Rockets take Duke's Jay Williams, even if their
best player, Steve Francis, was also a point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Barkley said if Yao ever scored 19 points, he would
kiss studio partner Kenny Smith's, uh, cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Word was relayed to Yao, resulting in a furious effort to
translate the jibe. The Chinese have no corresponding phrase
(remember, their civilization is a lot older than ours).</TE>
<TE>   Yao was mistakenly told that Barkley said if he scored 19 points,
Charles said he would kiss him.</TE>
<TE>   Said Yao, who is the most unaffected person in the whirlwind that
surrounds him:</TE>
<TE>   "Then I'll just score 18."</TE>
<TE>   Yao is making strides in the few minutes that Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich gives him. After scoring 13 points in five games, he had
seven in No. 6. Friday marked his first time in double figures with
10 points in 14 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is better than the numbers. As it was at the World
Championships, the pattern among NBA players continues to be: sneer
first, marvel later.</TE>
<TE>   "Yao played great tonight," the Suns' Penny Hardaway said. "I
haven't seen a lot of him, but all the clips they show on ESPN, all
the news stations, it's kinda like they want to embarrass him a
little bit, like he can't really play. But tonight, he showed a lot
of flashes of greatness....</TE>
<TE>   "He can run the floor and he can move down there.... I didn't
expect that."</TE>
<TE>   Tell Charlie to get ready, it shouldn't be too long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From China With Love</TE>
<TE>   If Yao seems an anomaly in the NBA, which is made up of extremely
tall men, and increasingly more from foreign lands, imagine what a
phenomenon he represented among the Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   Born to basketball players (his father was 6-10, his mother a 6-4
center on the national team), Yao started out gawky and weak but a
fast learner.</TE>
<TE>   As a teen, he attended one of Michael Jordan's summer camps and
opened eyes, while getting his own opened.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went to America, I didn't like to dunk much," he told ESPN
magazine's Cal Fussman, through an interpreter. "It's not the Chinese
way.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, I'd get the ball near the basket, shoot a layup and
the coach would be saying, 'Dunk the ball!' But I was used to laying
it in. Finally, the coach said, 'If you get the ball in close and
don't dunk it, all of your teammates are going to have to run laps.'
But I couldn't help it. I was very accustomed to laying the ball in
the basket. All of my teammates were running laps, begging me to
dunk. Finally after about a week and many laps, I began to dunk it
every time."</TE>
<TE>   His pro career began when he was 16 and, like his NBA career,
started slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came to the Chinese league five years ago," Yang Yi said,
"he played against Wang Zhizhi, who was the best player in China.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like Yao Ming's first night in the NBA, in Indianapolis,
when he could do nothing [no points, two rebounds in 11 minutes]....
But in five years, Yao Ming went step by step to becoming the most
dominant player in China."</TE>
<TE>   By Yao's third pro season in China, he had popped up on NBA radar
screens. If he entered the draft after his fourth season, he probably
would have gone No. 1 ahead of preps Kwame Brown and Tyson Chandler.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Yao stayed in China. In the meantime, in the way of the
NBA and its attendant media, people who had been building him up
wiled away the hours until they actually laid eyes on him by
deconstructing him.</TE>
<TE>   He was compared to foreign players as limited as Rik Smits, or
U.S. players as disappointing as Shawn Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Even admirers thought he was behind the play, didn't react well,
and played the foreign finesse game, rather than the NBA
attack-the-basket game.</TE>
<TE>   He came to Chicago last May to hold a workout, showing his touch
and mobility, but the question everyone asked was whether he could
get off the plane and play Shaquille O'Neal on even terms.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jerry West, who had recently taken the job in Memphis, asked
to compare Yao to O'Neal or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: "He's not any of
those guys."</TE>
<TE>   In a sign of how things were going, an NBA release listing Yao's
measured height and weight at Chicago, included a typo that made him
236 pounds, rather than his actual 296.</TE>
<TE>   When the Rockets drew the No. 1 pick, there was speculation that
they might take someone more ready to play, that the Chinese
government might not let Yao come for a full season or would demand
half his salary.</TE>
<TE>   It was actually a no-brainer. The Rockets didn't need Yao to be as
good as Shaq, just better than Kelvin Cato.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here for the ride," Tomjanovich said. "There's no way we were
looking at him [Yao] that I said, 'Automatically he's going to come
in and take over.' "</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens won't be automatic, but the ride has started.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coming to America</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time I saw him want to dunk on as many people
as he could every time he touched the ball. When you saw him act like
that -- forget the skills, the size, the talent. It was like, 'Whoo!'
There was a disposition to dominate.</TE>
<TE>   "When you see a man of that size with that mentality ... you start
to think he has the ability to be a franchise player. And you don't
throw that term around loosely."</TE>
<TE>   -- San Antonio</TE>
<TE>   personnel director Brett Brown</TE>
<TE>   after watching Yao last summer</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't too many guys who have made me feel short, but, wow,
he's big. He made me feel short and small."</TE>
<TE>   -- Spur 7-1 center</TE>
<TE>   David Robinson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now for the matchup you've been waiting for ...</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker vs. Jason Collier?</TE>
<TE>   It was supposed to be Shaq vs. Yao tonight at Staples Center, even
if it would have been a ritual, with Shaq coming out just about the
time Yao entered for his seven-minute stint.</TE>
<TE>   With Yao's other disadvantages, he was obliged to play for China
in the Asian Games, setting his arrival in camp back until Oct. 20,
nine days before the season opened.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody's gone through what this kid's gone through," Tomjanovich
says.</TE>
<TE>   "He missed the whole summer. Summer league's so important, just
our style of play.... The two months after that when you process that
stuff in your individual workouts with your coaches. And then, the
most important time for anybody, the first two weeks of training camp
when you put in your nuts and bolts.</TE>
<TE>   "So he missed all that. He comes in, there's just media flying all
over the place.... It's been a real tough thing.</TE>
<TE>   "He's handled it great. He's had some real good games and he's had
some games that weren't that good. He gained respect from his
teammates in the first practice [with] his passing, some of the moves
he made. He's just a good, team guy."</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, Yao is a reserve team guy. With Cato out Friday,
Tomjanovich started Collier.</TE>
<TE>   Smits, who would become an All-Star, was painfully slow with
chronically injured feet. Bradley was enticing but showed little in
the way of a work ethic or fondness for the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody knows what the future is going to be and I definitely
don't," Tomjanovich says. "My gut feeling is, I can say confidently,
with time he [Yao] will be a good NBA player. There's something
special about him, how he does things, that there's a chance he could
be better than that.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is nervous system, situations, injuries. But he's got
a feel for the game. I think he loves the game, has a passion for the
game. But again, it's with time."</TE>
<TE>   These days, when Yao is near the basket, he hammers the ball home.
His nervous system looks fine.</TE>
<TE>   Perceived as a stranger in a strange land, he's frequently asked
if he has been able to find Chinese food, as if that were difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he loves steak. In Shanghai, his favorite restaurant was
Tony Roma's.</TE>
<TE>   He goes through news conferences at each new city, grinning,
firing off lines.</TE>
<TE>   To a question about how much English he speaks, he says, through
the interpreter, that if he understood more, he would fire the
interpreter.</TE>
<TE>   To a question about scrutiny from the Houston Chronicle beat man,
Jonathan Feigen, he says he's aware of it, because he sees Feigen at
every game.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't quite Billy Crystal, but the room keeps breaking up,
probably because the young man seems so likable.</TE>
<TE>   "He is cute," Yang Yi says. "He is humorous. I have never seen a
player from China who is so cute. I think it helps him make good
relationships."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, asked about his highs and lows, Yao says, "The happiest
moments are when I get to go home in the evening, and the hardest are
when I leave the house."</TE>
<TE>   It has already been a long season for him, with 90% of it to go.
The Rockets will be back to play the Lakers on Feb. 18, though that's
still early for a duel of titans, as opposed to an introduction.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Yao will play the Lakers in L.A. twice a year for the
foreseeable future, when the gulf between him and Shaq-Fu may close.</TE>

<LD>"The BFG"</LD>
<LD>   By Roald Dahl</LD>
<LD>   This story is about a Big Friendly Giant (BFG) and an 8-year-old
girl named Sophie. The BFG is kindly, giving, and has excellent
hearing. He spends his days catching dreams and blowing them into
little children's bedrooms. Sophie, whose parents died in a car
accident, lives in an orphanage.</LD>
<TE>   One night, unable to sleep, Sophie looks out her window and sees
the BFG blowing dreams into the window next door. When the BFG sees
her, he kidnaps her, thinking that she will report him to the
newspaper and they will put him in a zoo. But as time goes by, they
get to know each other and become friends. The BFG and Sophie go
dream-catching together, and Sophie begins to understand the giant's
unusual way of speaking. He describes unpleasant things with words
like disgusterous, rotsome, and filthing.</TE>
<TE>   One day, the BFG tells Sophie that there are nine unfriendly
giants who eat children. He tells her that kids like her would be
swallowed up like a piece of frumpkin pie! Sophie tells the BFG that
this is not right and they need to do something. They decide to tell
the queen about the nine unfriendly giants, because she is the only
one who can do something. The problem is getting the queen to believe
their story.</TE>
<TE>   Read the book to find out if the BFG and Sophie can convince the
queen to help them.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Wright was a pest. He was always taking things. He took Sarah's
eraser and said it was his. He took Marcy's pencil and hid it behind
the fish tank. And he took my jacket and wore it. That was too much.</LD>
<LD>   "Give me back my jacket," I told him.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not your jacket," he said. "It's mine."</LD>
<TE>   "That jacket has my name in it," I said.</TE>
<TE>   I knew that because my mom sewed a label in it with my name in big
letters.</TE>
<TE>   "No it doesn't," he said. "It can't have, because it's mine."</TE>
<TE>   I had to think of a way to get my jacket back. I had to make Peter
Wright take it off. But how? It seemed to be glued to him. He wore it
all through class and all through lunch. But the day was getting
warmer. And I got an idea.</TE>
<TE>   At recess, I said, "Hey, Peter, want to play tetherball?"</TE>
<TE>   Peter looked surprised. "Sure, why not?" he said. "I can beat you
with one hand behind my back."</TE>
<TE>   He tried. The ball wound around the pole. It came at me a million
miles an hour. I swung with all my might and hit it back the other
way. Around the pole went the rope, once, twice and I had him.</TE>
<TE>   "You cheated," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I didn't." I laughed because it was funny that I could beat
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'll show you how to play this game." Peter took off the
jacket and tossed it on the ground. He made a fist and hit the ball.
The rope swung around the pole and the game was over.</TE>
<TE>   Peter laughed. "I told you I could win."</TE>
<TE>   I picked up my jacket and slipped my arms into it. "No, Peter," I
said, "I'm the winner."</TE>
<TE>   He was not laughing when I left.</TE>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>British police charged three men with terrorism offenses, authorities
said, but they declined to comment on a newspaper claim that the
suspects had planned to release cyanide gas on London's Underground
rail system.</LD>
<LD>   Scotland Yard said late Saturday that the men were charged under
the Terrorism Act with "possession of articles for the preparation,
instigation and commission of terrorism acts."</LD>
<LD>   Police sources said that the men were not charged with plotting a
specific attack and that no noxious substance had been found.</LD>
<TE>   Police said those arrested were Rabah Chekat-Bais, 21; Karim
Kadouri, 33; and Rabah Kadris, in his mid-30s.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday Times newspaper said police arrested three men of
Tunisian or Moroccan background who had planned to launch a cyanide
attack on the Underground rail system.</TE>

<HD>Self-Immolations on Rise in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>The women are apparently trying to escape arranged or
unhappy marriages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HERAT, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Early in the morning as her father was saying his prayers,
20-year-old Ahbeda -- engaged to marry her first cousin at the
family's bidding -- apparently doused herself with fuel and set
herself afire.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours later, she was swaddled in bandages in the primitive
burn unit at Herat Public Hospital, writhing in pain and gasping for
air, with burns covering her entire body. Her hair was mostly singed
off, her lips nearly gone, her face a blackened blur, her odds of
survival slim.</LD>
<LD>   Two other young women, who also apparently had set themselves
ablaze, lay in nearby beds.</LD>
<TE>   Such self-immolations are becoming disturbingly common among young
women in western Afghanistan. Although statistics aren't available,
the hospital's doctors report that they appear to be on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   An average of three girls arrive at the regional hospital each
week, most with life-threatening burns covering more than 40% of
their bodies. The hospital has had more than 100 cases this year, the
doctors say, with most of the young women dying soon after arrival.</TE>
<TE>   The typical victim is 14 to 20 years old and is trying to escape a
marriage arranged by her father, the hospital staff says. Often, the
marriage is to an older man who has another wife and children, in a
society where it is not uncommon for men to have multiple wives. For
example, a 14-year-old arrived recently at the hospital in critical
condition with only her palms unscorched. She had been given in
marriage to a 60-year-old married man with grown children.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions for women have improved somewhat since the ouster of
the Taliban a year ago. Schools hum with the voices of eager girls
who were barred from formal education under the old regime and whose
parents, for the most part, are glad to have them back in the
classroom. Television features some female broadcasters. And ever so
slowly, women are poking their heads out in public from under the
head-to-toe burkas that were mandatory under the Taliban -- although
they have yet to shed the garments, fearing harassment from men on
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, people who had expected social changes for women have
been disappointed on many counts, with lingering attitudes in many
families a huge block to liberation.</TE>
<TE>   Most Afghan girls and women are still expected to cover their
bodies, be subservient, remain mostly apart from men, even in the
home when guests arrive, and live with their husbands' families.
There has been no return to the 1980s, when Afghanistan was under
Soviet control and women in the cities could safely wear miniskirts
in public.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Shehin Entazary, a female surgeon who has treated many of the
burn victims, attributes the problems in part to illiteracy among the
young women, who lost six years of schooling under the Taliban, and
their families.</TE>
<TE>   "I am struggling to stop families from giving their daughters to
married men," she said. "Why would they give them to someone who is
married and has children? Some people think it's customary to give
their daughters to married men.</TE>
<TE>   "Women never have any rights," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The influence of slightly more liberal Iran also might be feeding
frustration. Some of the burn victims had lived there as refugees
while Afghanistan was under Taliban rule beginning in the mid-1990s.
They returned to a homeland that offers women even fewer rights.</TE>
<TE>   Dowries are particularly daunting in Afghanistan. In a poor
nation, older and more established men are more apt to be able to
afford the $500 to $1,500 that the groom and his family are expected
to pony up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the girls are animals being sold," said Dr. Saleha
Hekamt, a female surgeon at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The self-immolations have been given a lot of attention by Herat's
public television station, which might have given rise to copycat
incidents. One doctor's young daughter surprised her by threatening
to burn herself when she was angry about something.</TE>
<TE>   Local warlord Ismail Khan, who controls much of western
Afghanistan, has visited the burn ward and implored girls not to take
their lives. He talked to one victim in a televised interview in
which she expressed remorse for trying to kill herself. The young
woman said she had burned herself because she wanted to have her
wedding at a better hall than the families had arranged.</TE>
<TE>   Khan promptly ordered all wedding halls closed and a new one built
for everyone to use, so there would be no class distinction in the
ceremonies. But the new structure is still far from completion, and
the others soon reopened.</TE>
<TE>   To help combat the attempted suicides and other problems, the TV
station is running a series of programs titled "Mirror of
Edification." Some deal with teaching husbands how they should talk
to their wives and how family members should relate to one another.</TE>
<TE>   It might help. Some who burned themselves were chafing under their
husbands' control.</TE>
<TE>   In the bed next to Ahbeda, 27-year-old Fatena initially told
doctors that she had set herself on fire because her husband refused
to let her watch television. She then said it was an accident. Asked
how women are doing in Afghanistan, she replied through her bandages:
"All Afghan women have a dark future. Now we have peace, but we still
have family problems."</TE>
<TE>   Asked how her husband treats her, she replied, "My husband is a
nice man, but he does not have a job."</TE>
<TE>   The night before, a woman named Paimana came in with burns over
90% of her body after setting herself ablaze. She had been married
for three years and had a 2-year-old daughter. Her husband had left
her, and she was in despair.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, family members have set the victims on fire. One
woman burned her daughter-in-law for reasons that were not clear. The
victim died, but the older woman was not punished, doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   If the girls are alive when they get to the hospital, they
probably won't get much better, given the deplorable conditions.</TE>
<TE>   At Ahbeda's bedside, her father, mother and another woman in a
burka tried to hold her writhing limbs still. The room buzzed with
people tending the six other burn patients.</TE>
<TE>   Her father's bright greenish-blue eyes welled with tears as he
explained what happened. He had been saying his prayers when he heard
a yell from the kitchen and found his daughter burned.</TE>
<TE>   The family had made the decision that Ahbeda would marry the
cousin, a farmer, but the father insists that she had agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter was happy. It was no problem," the father said.
Outside the room, Ahbeda's 21-year-old fiance, Faqir Ahmad, also
wept. "I don't know why this happened."</TE>
<TE>   He had been able to pay only about $300 of the $1,500 dowry, he
said, so they weren't even sure when the wedding would be. "She was
my cousin, my relative. She had agreed."</TE>
<TE>   But parents here sometimes don't tell the truth, said Hekamt, the
surgeon. The families fear -- incorrectly -- that doctors won't treat
the young women if the injuries were self-inflicted. If the daughters
can talk, they often tell the doctors the truth.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, however, the full truth will never be known. Ahbeda
died a few hours later.</TE>

<HD>Australia Hunts for Terror Cells</HD>
<DH>Authorities focus on two Muslim clerics who arrived from
Malaysia. The homes of more than a dozen Indonesians have been
raided.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>When two traveling Muslim preachers came here in the 1990s, Muchsen
Thalib met them at the airport, drove them around and let them stay
in his spare room for weeks at a time.</LD>
<LD>   The holy men used the names Abdus Samad and Abdul Halim, but their
host knew their true identities: Abu Bakar Bashir and Abdullah
Sungkar. They were militant clerics who had fled Indonesia in 1985
for Malaysia to avoid subversion charges.</LD>
<LD>   This month, more than a dozen heavily armed Australian police and
intelligence agents raided Thalib's house and questioned him for
hours about his ties to the two religious teachers. The officers
carted away three computers, a mobile phone, a fax machine, stacks of
documents and 15 videotapes that Thalib had made of the clerics'
lectures. They also took his passport.</LD>
<TE>   "They consider me a terror suspect," said the clothing shop owner.
"They came with their guns and everything. They miscalculated about
me. I would not support anyone who was involved in any type of
crime."</TE>
<TE>   The preachers' visits are the focus of an intensive investigation
into whether the pair established "sleeper" terror cells in
Australia, which until recently seemed far removed from the turmoil
of the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities here say Bashir visited Australia at least 11 times,
often staying for weeks and traveling from city to city. Intelligence
officers have raided the homes of more than a dozen Indonesian
immigrants in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth -- sometimes breaking down
the doors -- in their search for evidence of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The Singapore and Malaysia governments say Bashir heads Jemaah
Islamiah, a Southeast Asian terror network affiliated with Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda organization. Jemaah Islamiah has been blamed for
dozens of attacks that killed more than 40 people.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian police arrested Bashir last month on charges that he
was behind a series of church bombings, a mosque bombing and a plot
to kill Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri. They suspect he
also was behind the Oct. 12 bombing in Bali that killed 191 people,
nearly half of them Australians.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir has repeatedly denied involvement in terrorism but
advocates the creation of a worldwide Islamic state. He says church
bombings are justified in defense of Islam, and he praises Bin Laden
as a true Muslim warrior.</TE>
<TE>   The Bali blast killed more Australians overseas than any other
event since World War II and has badly shaken this country of 19
million people. Many victims were young men and women enjoying an
evening at a nightclub when the attack occurred. For weeks, there
were funerals almost daily as the badly burned bodies of the victims
were identified and returned home.</TE>
<TE>   Australia has long been wary of neighboring Indonesia, a nation of
228 million and the world's most populous Muslim country. Officials
fear that the extremist Islamic ideology that inspires terror attacks
elsewhere has spread to Australia's community of 500,000 Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Two Australians seized overseas, Muslim convert David Hicks and
Egyptian-born immigrant Mamdouh Habib, are locked up at the U.S. Navy
base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba on charges that they are associated
with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   One Singaporean Jemaah Islamiah member, Hashim bin Abas, traveled
frequently to Australia on business before he was arrested in
December for his alleged involvement in a plot to blow up the U.S.
and Australian embassies in Singapore, among other targets.</TE>
<TE>   In a videotape made last year and recently aired in the West, Bin
Laden said Australia deserved to be attacked because it had helped
predominantly Christian East Timor, a former Indonesian province,
become independent. He asserted that the onetime Portuguese colony
was "part of the Islamic world." In an audiotape released last week,
a voice identified as Bin Laden's said Australia "ignored the warning
until it woke up to the sounds of explosions in Bali."</TE>
<TE>   "We know that there are sympathizers of overseas terrorist
organizations in Australia," said Atty. Gen. Daryl Williams. "We know
that there are people in Australia who trained with Al Qaeda in
Pakistan and Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   In Perth, police raided the homes of Abdur Rahman Ayub, who
reportedly fought for five years against Soviet forces in
Afghanistan, and his brother, Abdul Rahim Ayub, who worked at an
Islamic school in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   No one has been arrested on terror charges as a result of the
raids, although five people were picked up for immigration
violations. Islamic leaders contend that the police tactics were an
overreaction by a conservative government hostile to Muslim
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think that any of the people have been involved in any
kind of activity that could be classified as terrorism," said Amjad
Ali Mehboob, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic
Councils.</TE>
<TE>   The Bali bombing triggered numerous attacks against Muslims living
in Australia, Islamic leaders say, and the police raids have fed fear
and anger among Australians.</TE>
<TE>   Mehboob said his office has received many reports of harassment of
Muslims on the street, particularly women, whose head scarves make
them visible. Much of the abuse is verbal, he said, but some Muslims
have been physically attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Williams insists that the government was justified in using armed
officers in the raids because some of the targeted were known to keep
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "We were not targeting the Muslim community in general," he said.
"We were not targeting Indonesians in general. We were targeting
specific individuals."</TE>
<TE>   The agents collected "valuable information," Williams said,
adding, "The government does not accept at face value what has been
said in the media by individuals who were the subjects of the raids."</TE>
<TE>   During his 11 visits to Australia, authorities say, Bashir
sometimes traveled with Sungkar and sometimes on his own. Bashir's
last visit was in early 1998, the attorney general said.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir told The Times in January that he had never been to
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Sungkar last visited Australia in 1999, Williams said. Widely
recognized as the more influential leader of the two, he died of a
heart attack that year shortly after the two lifelong friends
returned from exile to Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Bashir and Sungkar entered Australia under false
names. Most likely, they used Malaysian passports, although they were
not Malaysian citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bashir may now be stateless.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian national Police Chief Dai Bachtiar says Bashir lost his
Indonesian citizenship while living in Malaysia because he failed to
report to the embassy during his first five years abroad, as required
by law.</TE>
<TE>   The chief's comment raises the possibility that Bashir could be
deported to Malaysia, where he has been wanted since December on
terrorism charges. Deporting Bashir would relieve Indonesia of the
responsibility for trying him while satisfying the demands of other
nations that he be jailed. Malaysia has a strict security act that
permits terror suspects to be locked up indefinitely without trial.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said the Australian government is investigating whether
Bashir used the same methods here that officials in Singapore and
Malaysia say Jemaah Islamiah employed to form terrorist cells there.</TE>
<TE>   In those countries, the group's religious teachers sought out
likely subjects, offered them Islamic training and then indoctrinated
them with a twisted interpretation of Islam in which violence is
justified and innocent women and children who are killed are simply
casualties of war, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Several Sydney residents whose homes were raided said they
attended sermons and met with the preachers, but they insisted that
they never heard either man express extremist views. Bashir, they
said, emphasized that Indonesian Muslim immigrants should attend
mosque faithfully and live peacefully alongside Australians.</TE>
<TE>   "He often told us to be good Muslims in this country," said Jaya
Basri, who said he attended three of Bashir's lectures. "We should be
nice to the neighbors, to others. He told us to be nice to the
Australian government, too. He said we should do that because -- and
I really remember this one -- our condition here is much better than
in Indonesia."</TE>
<TE>   Basri's home in Sydney was one of the first raided. He apparently
came to the attention of Australian intelligence because he
circulated a newsletter in the Indonesian community that mentioned
Bashir. Basri, who immigrated in 1994, denies any connection to
terrorism and says he was just reporting on events in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not members of Jemaah Islamiah. We do not have any link
with Jemaah Islamiah," he said. "Why do they blame us?"</TE>
<TE>   Another subject of the raids was Kushmir Nesirwan, who arrived in
Australia in 1975 and became a citizen in 1990. He attended some of
Bashir's sermons and once invited the cleric to his house for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   A devout Muslim, Nesirwan says that two years ago he visited
Indonesia's Molucca Islands -- the scene of bitter fighting between
Muslims and Christians -- to see for himself what was happening.</TE>
<TE>   However, the 48-year-old butcher says he has nothing to do with
violence and resents that publicity over the raids has made him a
target. "They call me a terrorist when I'm walking down the street,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Thalib heard about the raids, he knew that agents would want
to speak to him.</TE>
<TE>   Not only had the two clerics been his guests, but he had also
hosted another Indonesian militant, Laskar Jihad leader Jafar Umar
Thalib, who is his cousin. Laskar Jihad sent thousands of Muslim
militants to fight Christians in the Moluccas.</TE>
<TE>   Muchsen Thalib, 50, said he called the Australian Security
Intelligence Organization and offered to come in. Instead, more than
a dozen agents arrived at his door at 6 a.m. the following day and
searched his house for more than six hours. The agents accused him of
being a terrorist and threatened him with 25 years in prison under
Australia's new anti-terror law, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no reason to come with weapons and make everyone
scared," said Thalib, who became an Australian citizen in 1999. "I
keep asking myself, why did they do this to me?"</TE>

<HD>Inspectors to Scour Iraq for Mobile Weapons Labs</HD>
<DH>Western analysts believe a nondescript fleet of trucks
could be evasive -- and lethal if bombed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter and Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As U.S. forces weigh storming across the Iraqi border in the coming
months, their ability to handle the armored columns of an aging army
they crushed 11 years ago is not much in doubt. Far less certain is
their ability to deal with another threat: a shadowy fleet of
nondescript trucks crisscrossing Iraq that Western intelligence
believes is carrying biological weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Rumbling along Iraq's highways or threading their way through
crowded city streets, these mobile weapons labs may look like ice
cream trucks, motor homes or 18-wheeler tractor trailer trucks,
officials and experts say. But their cargo is believed to be germ
agents such as anthrax, botulinum toxin and aflatoxin that
theoretically could kill hundreds of thousands in an attack.</LD>
<LD>   Dubbed "Winnebagos of death," the anonymous vehicles are hard to
locate, even with sophisticated sensors. Military officials are
sharply divided about how to handle them, even if they can be found,
with some arguing that bombing the mobile labs risks a catastrophic
release of germ agents.</LD>
<TE>   Finding such labs will be one of the toughest challenges facing
United Nations weapons inspectors as they return to Iraq after a
four-year absence and try to track down any biological, as well as
chemical or nuclear, weapons that President Saddam Hussein's regime
might have stockpiled.</TE>
<TE>   If the labs evade detection, U.S. intelligence analysts fear, the
officers or scientists who operate them might try to use germ agents
in a desperate counterattack or spirit the materials away to sell to
terrorists or foreign governments.</TE>
<TE>   If such materials fall into the hands of a group such as Al Qaeda,
that would turn the military campaign into what "could be the
greatest proliferation disaster in history," said Daniel Benjamin, a
former National Security Council official and coauthor of "The Age of
Sacred Terror."</TE>
<TE>   Those entrusted with the labs are "loyal servants of the regime,"
Benjamin said. They would be unlikely to carry out terror attacks on
their own initiative, he said, but their fears about a bleak future
under an American-installed regime could give them incentive to sell
the material.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing to prevent any one of them from pulling off by
the side of the road and having the most lethal pathogens loaded into
a cooler or rucksack, and disappearing," Benjamin said.</TE>
<TE>   A senior U.S. intelligence official compared the task of finding
the labs to the frustrating search last month for a white truck that
was believed to hold a sniper who terrorized the Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   "Look how many white vans were stopped here in D.C. looking for a
sniper," he said. "There are a lot of trucks [in Iraq], a lot of
trailers.... I think it's going to be real hard to find them."</TE>
<TE>   While the labs are "not our No. 1 problem," the official added,
they are a threat "that needs to be considered, and weighs heavily on
our commanders' minds."</TE>
<TE>   The mobile labs are the latest troubling aspect of the
unconventional weapons program that Hussein launched about 30 years
ago and worked doggedly to conceal from the U.N. weapons inspectors
who were sent to disarm the country after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Denial Is Doubted</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has acknowledged that it developed quantities of several
pathogens that could kill hundreds of thousands in an attack. The
regime insists it has destroyed all of its supplies -- an assertion
the U.S. flatly rejects. In fact, some U.S. officials and outside
experts believe Iraq has augmented its deadly arsenal with smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   While Hussein didn't use chemical or biological weapons in the
Gulf War, officials believe he would be more likely to do so if he
believed his regime was collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials are suspected of having hidden caches of
biological and chemical weapons materials in hundreds of sites across
their country, which is only slightly larger than California. U.N.
inspectors are expected to have trouble unearthing them.</TE>
<TE>   Even tougher to find would be mobile labs, which the Iraqis are
believed to have begun operating in 1996, after U.N. weapons
inspectors found and destroyed two large biological weapon production
facilities. The British and German governments, and the CIA and
Pentagon have all asserted the existence of the mobile labs in
separate reports this year.</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi defectors have told U.N. and American officials that the
regime decided it was much safer to pack laboratory equipment into
vehicles that could operate while parked at weapons plants but could
shift location regularly to elude detection.</TE>
<TE>   Defectors report that "Saddam has taken the entire Iraqi program
on the road," Kenneth M. Pollack, former director of Persian Gulf
affairs at the National Security Council, wrote in his recent book,
"The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   "Baghdad has a number of BW [biological weapons] labs that can
move around the country as needed, leaving no trace and having no
signature that Western intelligence can detect," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Spertzel, former head of the United Nations bioweapons
inspection program, said inspectors used to joke ruefully that the
only way to find all the fixed labs would be to search every
structure in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "And the mobile labs makes it that much tougher," he said. "You'd
have to check every van in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Spertzel said that from his four years of experience in Iraq he
believes most of the people in the germ weapons program were forced
into their jobs and would be eager to leave them behind. But in
truth, no one knows how those in the program will react -- either to
inspections or to an American-led attack.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials acknowledge that they do not know precisely how
many labs there are, and what they look like, though they have
pictures of what they take to be labs housed in 18-wheel tractor
trailers. Some experts believe the Iraqis may use several types of
vehicles to throw off the pursuers.</TE>
<TE>   "We know they're there," the intelligence official said. "We don't
know 100% what's in them."</TE>
<TE>   Customizing Vehicles</TE>
<TE>   Some experts speculate that the Iraqis have built functioning labs
by installing fermenters, spray dryers, centrifuges and supporting
gear in two or three 18-wheelers with refrigeration capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Spertzel said smaller vehicles, such as Winnebagos, could produce
enough germ material for terrorist attacks but probably not enough
for the larger-scale military use. Officials say they do not believe
these labs contain biological materials that have been "weaponized"
-- loaded into bombs, warheads or aircraft spraying devices for
battlefield use. But they note that that this final step might be
quickly done.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to assume the worst," one intelligence official said,
adding that such possibilities are "one reason the Department of
Defense is looking at vaccinations for all its forces."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they believe their best hope of finding the
labs lies in finding defectors early in a war who will point them
out. Bush administration officials have tried to encourage
cooperation by warning that Iraqis who take part in chemical or
biological attacks would be charged with war crimes, while those who
cooperate would receive humane treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Iraqis officials may have given limited information about the
program to small groups so that few people know where all the labs
are. Once the vehicles are on the road, their whereabouts may be
known only to their crews.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Air Force officials say their unmanned aircraft, the
Predator, can track down the suspected mobile labs because of the
detailed images and 40-hour uninterrupted video surveillance it
offers. Satellites and E-8C Joint STARS surveillance planes, which
are used to track moving tanks and other vehicles, also might be
helpful.</TE>
<TE>   But their usefulness is limited if the U.S. military doesn't have
additional information to distinguish these trucks from others on the
road and if the vehicles are camouflaged by the heavy traffic around
Baghdad, a city of 5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Predator is good, heavy traffic in an urban setting
"would be problematic," said Michael Vickers, a former Army Special
Forces officer who is an analyst at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments think tank in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Vickers recalled that during the Gulf War, U.S. forces were
notably unsuccessful in trying to track motor homes that they
believed were carrying Hussein and his commanders around.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts suggested that the U.S. military might resort to
setting up roadblocks or creating "no-drive" zones in areas where
they believe the trucks might be circulating. But Benjamin, the
former NSC official, said the limits of military manpower for such
tasks might become an issue.</TE>
<TE>   Even if mobile labs are found, officials face the tough decision
of how to destroy any dangerous material they carry. While the
easiest course might be to blow it up, that could prove disastrous if
it includes a biological agent in a form, such as freeze-dried
particles, that could survive an explosion and be carried off by the
wind, an official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Without knowing what's in it, you'd be ill-advised to just bomb
it," the official said. "If you drop a 500-pound bomb on a truck,
even if it's a 'smart' bomb, you may be releasing some real bad stuff
on a community."</TE>
<TE>   He said the best approach would be to intercept the vehicle and
carefully destroy the materials. But the official acknowledged that
there are conflicting views on how to handle such a situation.</TE>
<TE>   The military typically uses powerful incendiary bombs to vaporize
such material at high temperature, said Jonathan Tucker, a former
U.N. weapons inspector who is a senior fellow at the U.S. Institute
for Peace. It is not clear whether Iraq has the sophistication to
produce anthrax in a dried form, Tucker said. But if they can, a bomb
attack "could be extremely dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Military planners agonized over a similar problem during the Gulf
War, when they were faced with the question of whether chemical
weapons sites should be attacked. The debate came to a head when
satellite imagery showed a disturbing collection of pyramid-style
mounds of earth in the desert surrounding Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "We had reason to suspect they were loaded with chemical and
biological agents," said a top Gulf War planner who has since left
the military. "The question was: Do we blow them up or not? Some
argued that if we blew them up you'd kill the whole population of
Baghdad. Others said if the [explosion] is hot enough you'll burn
everything and there's no problem."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Colin L. Powell, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff and now secretary of State, ordered strikes on the mounds with
some of the largest munitions available, 1,000-pound bombs. It
appeared that no one died from the bombings. But the political
sensitivity of the issue became apparent in the mid-1990s, when
veterans groups began to argue that release of chemicals might have
caused the mysterious "Gulf War syndrome" that afflicted some who
served in the conflict.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Says It Welcomes Inspections</HD>
<DH>Baghdad will be cleared of weapons accusations, official
says. U.N. team prepares for work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq said Saturday that U.N. inspections would disprove accusations
that it possessed weapons of mass destruction, and the chief
inspector charged with the search vowed he would not tolerate spies
on his team.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz said that Baghdad welcomed chief
U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and that the results of the
inspections would expose as lies the U.S. charges that Iraq
maintained weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "The Americans are worried because the truth is going to be
exposed and their lies are going to be exposed," Aziz said in one of
the first personal statements since President Saddam Hussein agreed
Wednesday to new inspections.</LD>
<TE>   Aziz's remarks echoed an earlier message from Hussein to the
parliament saying U.N. inspections would prove Iraq was devoid of
weapons of mass destruction and allow it to work on ending the
12-year-old U.N. sanctions crippling the country.</TE>
<TE>   Blix and Mohammed Baradei, director of the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency, are scheduled to arrive in
Baghdad on Monday to begin the investigation, with inspections set to
start Nov. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said Saturday that he could not rule out the possibility that
there might be spies on his team. He added that any intelligence
agents would be ordered off the group.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris on his way to Cyprus and Baghdad, Blix said it was
important that the team avoid the charges of bias that undermined the
work of the last inspectors, who worked in Iraq from 1992 to 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has accused some previous U.N. arms inspectors of being spies
for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said he expected to have 100 inspectors in Iraq by the end of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush had tough words for Hussein, saying
he doubted that Iraq would adhere to the U.N. resolution granting
inspectors unfettered access to sites across Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "America and the world are now watching Saddam Hussein closely.
Any act of defiance or delay will indicate that he is taking the path
of deception once again, and this time the consequences would be
severe," Bush said in a radio address.</TE>

<HD>25,000 in Italy Protest Arrest of 20 Activists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Thousands of anti-globalization demonstrators marched in Rome,
Florence and Naples on Saturday to protest the arrests of 20
activists, including a leader of the movement, on charges stemming
from violent protests last year.</LD>
<LD>   About 10,000 people marched through central Rome, some 10,000 more
demonstrated in Naples, and at least 5,000 people walked past the
Duomo in Florence with banners calling for the release of the
suspects.</LD>
<LD>   The 20 arrested Friday are accused of political conspiracy,
subversion, disruptive propaganda to cause damage to the economy,
attacks on the constitution, incitement and invasion of public
buildings, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Carrying banners reading "Subversive???" and shouting "Free our
companions!" protesters gathered in central Rome despite a whipping
wind.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests of leaders of the anti-globalization movement in
southern Italy were ordered by a magistrate in Cosenza, Calabria,
based on a 359-page report that said the group had "a capacity to
threaten state security and public order."</TE>
<TE>   An additional 21 people are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Among those detained was Francesco Caruso, head of the "no global"
movement in Naples and one of the organizers of a recent anti-war
march in Florence that drew more than half a million demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   "People are really angry. We feel like we deserved something much
better after our successful march last week," said "no global" leader
Bruno Paladini.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition politicians criticized the arrests, and even some
members of the government said they were "perplexed" by the decision
to detain activists before they had been tried.</TE>

<HD>Israel Tightens Grip on Hebron After Palestinian Ambush</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HEBRON, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Armored vehicles backed by tanks roared into the heart of this
divided city Saturday as Israel moved to again seize control after 12
Israelis, nearly all of them soldiers and paramilitary police, were
killed by Palestinian gunmen a day earlier in a carefully laid
ambush.</LD>
<LD>   The dead included the military commander in Hebron, the
highest-ranking Israeli officer to die during 25 months of
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Slain along with Col. Dror Weinberg
were three soldiers under his command, five paramilitary border
police and three members of the security squad of Kiryat Arba, a
Jewish settlement a few hundred yards from the attack site.</LD>
<LD>   With Israeli elections less than three months away, Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon was under political pressure from right-wing allies to
launch an unsparing retaliatory strike against Palestinian militant
groups including Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for
Friday's attack. Top military officials held consultations Saturday
night about the scope and nature of any strike.</LD>
<TE>   In the dusty valley where the killings took place during the first
hours of the Jewish Sabbath, along a road used by settlers to walk to
prayers at a disputed shrine in downtown Hebron, the city's
deep-rooted animosities were on plain display in the attack's
aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   Sifting through the ruins of three homes demolished by soldiers
and mourning the uprooting of an ancient olive grove beside the road
where the shooting began, Palestinians murmured that they wished more
Jewish settlers had died.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope for 100 more attacks like this," said 12-year-old Hamid
abu Gharbiyyeh, who lives nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians with homes along the narrow side street where some of
the worst fighting took place insisted that they had no connection to
three gunmen who had staged the attack from just outside their doors.
The three were hunted down and killed by Israeli troops; military
officials said they were not certain whether others had taken part in
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards from a cluster of Palestinian homes, angry-looking
young Jewish settlers, wearing yarmulkes and toting M-16 rifles,
paced the road where the attack took place. It is used by settlers
who are always guarded by soldiers walking to and from Sabbath
prayers at the Cave of the Patriarchs, a shrine sacred to both
Muslims and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Relations between Hebron's 120,000 Palestinians and the settlers
-- 450 of whom live inside the city, and hundreds more on the
outskirts -- have long been marked by rancor and ugly daily
confrontations that usually fall to the army to break up.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the settlers hinted that they would take matters into
their own hands and exact vengeance for the ambush.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were the Palestinians, I would be very worried about what
might happen next," said 19-year-old Jonathan Stern, an off-duty
soldier from Kiryat Arba who took part in the fighting Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   He said he heard shooting break out just as he was returning to
the settlement from prayers. He grabbed his weapon, ran back down the
road, threw himself onto the ground and, together with the Israeli
troops, began firing into an olive grove where the attackers were
thought to be hiding. The grove was uprooted the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he did not intend to engage in any vigilante action
against the Palestinians but wouldn't be surprised if his fellow
settlers did.</TE>
<TE>   "People here believe there has to be an answer to a very serious
attack like this one," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Caught between the two sides was the Israeli military, which, in
addition to being on guard against revenge attacks on the
Palestinians, was taking up the painful task of investigating how
seasoned soldiers had allowed themselves to be lured into a dark,
dead-end street where the Palestinian gunmen managed to pick them off
one by one.</TE>
<TE>   The deaths represented the Israeli security forces' largest loss
of life in a single incident since April, when 13 soldiers died in a
Palestinian ambush inside the Jenin refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "We must learn what really happened here, on a tactical level,"
said Col. Noam Tibon, who replaced his slain colleague, a close
friend, as the Israeli commander in Hebron. Without elaborating, he
said, "I guess there were some mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Hebron had been touted by Israeli commanders as a
success story of sorts. Amid sweeping crackdowns elsewhere in the
West Bank, the city had remained quiet after occupying Israeli troops
pulled back and curfews were eased.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a tight clampdown could continue indefinitely while the army
hunts for those it holds responsible for the attack. Troops rounded
up nearly 50 Palestinian men Saturday, blindfolding suspects and
loading them onto army buses.</TE>
<TE>   "We will find, we will catch and we will destroy Islamic Jihad and
Hamas cells in Hebron," Tibon said.</TE>
<TE>   Similar open-ended operations have been going on in the northern
West Bank cities of Nablus and Jenin, where dozens of wanted men have
been arrested this month. In Jenin's refugee camp Saturday, a
17-year-old gunman, brother of a slain Islamic Jihad leader, died in
a shootout with Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   Israel acknowledges that a prolonged army presence in a crowded
civilian area can easily lead to accidental deaths. In Nablus, a
20-year-old woman, Samar Shrab, was killed Saturday as she leaned out
the window of her home. The army apologized for her death, saying
that troops had fired at a wall to deter Palestinians from breaking
the curfew and that a fragment had ricocheted.</TE>

<HD>Who's Hu? Doesn't Matter Much, Chinese Say of Their New
Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Henry Chu</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>BEIJING -- Talk to ordinary Chinese about Hu Jintao, the man who was
just named the new leader of their country, and the biggest
impression you get of him is that he seems to have made none.</LD>
<LD>   "Generally speaking, I have no impression of Hu Jintao," confessed
Liu Shuguang, an economics professor here in the capital. "He's so
quiet and behind-the-scenes that I don't know what he thinks or what
he wants to do."</LD>
<LD>   As he takes over as general secretary of the Communist Party --
the No. 1 job in China -- the 59-year-old Hu seems to have excelled
at fading into the background in a land more accustomed to
personality cults and incessant public adulation of its top leaders.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, his very modesty may have been what helped propel him to
the apex of Chinese politics, by making him a less likely target of
jealousy and enmity among his rivals.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, not only are world leaders puzzling over what to make
of the new head of the world's most populous nation, but so are most
of his fellow citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the bespectacled, unassuming Hu beyond what
appears in the official biography. Before his meteoric rise -- the
Chinese call it "helicoptering" -- to the top, he served in some of
China's poorest inland provinces. He was in charge in Tibet when the
Beijing regime declared martial law there in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   He is reputed to have a near-photographic memory and a fondness
for dancing.</TE>
<TE>   But his personal political views, beyond the scripted tributes he
has paid to the policies of his predecessor, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, remain a mystery.</TE>
<TE>   Even during last week's national party congress, Hu made no public
statements until Friday, when he was unveiled as the new party chief.
His brief remarks emphasized continuity in Chinese policy and nothing
more.</TE>
<TE>   Graduate student Lin Shan, 22, reads the newspaper every day. Yet
it was still hard, he said, to make any comment about Hu.</TE>
<TE>   "Hu was so quiet, and there were very few reports about him. I
think everything will remain pretty much unchanged," Lin said.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was as diligent as Lin in keeping up with the news
coming out of the party congress.</TE>
<TE>   When Hu's promotion was announced on national television Friday
morning, along with the new lineup of eight men who will serve with
him on China's ruling council, most Chinese seemed to be going about
business as usual -- working, shopping, getting ready for lunch. Few
were huddled around their televisions watching the great unveiling.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the fact that ordinary Chinese know so little about
Hu, yet aren't bothered by it, is a testament to one positive element
in China's politics: a move away from absolute rule by a single
person, as was the case under Mao Tse-tung and, to a lesser extent,
Deng Xiaoping.</TE>
<TE>   During Mao's era, a single pronouncement by the "Great Helmsman"
could literally mean life or death for millions of people, as his
underlings rushed to carry out his policy decrees, no matter how
disastrous their effects.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, many people now have faith that China's collective
leadership will continue down the path of economic and social
liberalization no matter who the top dog is. The country's
modernization drive, many believe, is irreversible and no longer
subject to the whim of one person.</TE>
<TE>   "A single individual's role is very limited in the new
leadership," said Liu, the economics professor. "That's a good sign."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his eight colleagues in the inner sanctum of
Chinese politics, Hu will also be constrained somewhat by his
predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Although Jiang has handed over the post of party chief, he managed
to pack several loyalists onto the new ruling council and to preserve
for himself a key military-related position. His presence will hover
above Hu through the near future.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, China's state-run media made no secret of Jiang's
lingering influence. Newspaper front pages featured photos of Jiang
alongside -- and sometimes more prominently than -- photos of his
successor.</TE>
<TE>   The relative indifference toward the new leader springs also from
the fact that Chinese politics remains a hermetically sealed world in
which ordinary citizens have next to no say.</TE>
<TE>   Only in such a secretive, unrepresentative system could someone
about whom so little is known rise to the top of the greasy pole,
through patronage and back-room dealing.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, on a visit to Malaysia, Hu gave a rare audience
to reporters, one of whom remarked on how mysterious he seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "That description is not fair to me," he replied.</TE>
<TE>   Then he walked away.</TE>

<HD>A Revolving Door for Pakistan's Militants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>PESHAWAR, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Police believed they had a good bust: members of an outlawed group
allied with Al Qaeda who were caught with a cache of assault rifles,
pistols, explosives and two CDs featuring Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   When the 11 suspected militants from Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen, the
Pakistani group with the longest and most direct ties to Bin Laden,
were locked up, the charge sheet landed on the desk of Sher Mohammed
Khan, an anti-terrorism prosecutor working from a cubbyhole of an
office.</LD>
<LD>   The case promptly hit a wall.</LD>
<TE>   Within days, the arrests were shrugged off as a setup by
overzealous cops. Khan agreed bail was appropriate, and a special
anti-terrorism court granted it about a month after the August
arrest. The two leaders of the 11 were quickly back on the street.</TE>
<TE>   One step forward in the war on terrorism became two steps back.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who was sworn in Saturday
for five more years, is working closely with the U.S. in the roundup
of foreign terror suspects. But his government's record against
home-grown militants, many of them allies of Bin Laden, looks less
resolute.</TE>
<TE>   Security forces have detained about 3,300 Pakistanis in sweeps
against local extremist groups. At least 1,300 have been released,
often after signing promises of good behavior. Among those released
in recent weeks are leaders of groups accused of killing hundreds of
minority Shiite Muslims and of launching terrorist attacks against
neighboring India. Musharraf has banned both groups.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are still holding 1,982 without charge, according to
confidential government figures. Musharraf issued a decree last month
extending the detention limit from 90 days to a year. In trials that
have reached a verdict, 41 people have been convicted and 21
acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   Critics maintain that, at best, Musharraf is warehousing some
extremists and leaving others untouched for fear of alienating the
religious right whose support he needs.</TE>
<TE>   A pattern of well-publicized arrests followed by quiet releases
also feeds suspicion that extremists are being protected, raising
doubts that Pakistan can get rid of terrorist networks by pruning
them back instead of cutting them off at the root.</TE>
<TE>   The contradiction is born of Musharraf's struggle to hold on to
power, said Samina Ahmed, Pakistan project director for the
International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based organization of security
and foreign policy analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "The main focus of the Musharraf government seems to be much more
on its own survival than eradicating terrorism on a systematic
basis," said Ahmed, a former researcher at Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's maneuverability also is limited by the conflict over
Kashmir. He was able to break with Afghanistan's Taliban regime, but
denouncing militants fighting Indian rule in Jammu and Kashmir state
would betray a struggle that began with Pakistan's birth 55 years
ago. And Kashmir has long been a rallying point for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Khan, an obliging man with a bushy handlebar mustache,
insisted that the nine men and two teenagers arrested in Peshawar
were not terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "They were people from the laboring class residing together in a
house," he said. "During the investigation, one or two Kalashnikovs
were recovered, and the accused said someone had put these in their
house, and they had not searched the bag."</TE>
<TE>   He accused the police of framing the men, something that he says
happens all the time. "As far as our people are concerned, I can
clearly say that they show suspects are guilty by planting things,"
he said. "It gets more attention from the government."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said the police didn't allege that the suspects
were part of a terrorist group, even though the charge sheet clearly
does. Police said they found more than a couple of assault rifles:
six pistols, four hand grenades, four detonators, 100 rounds of
different types of ammunition, 60 national identity cards in various
names and two Harkat membership cards.</TE>
<TE>   In a report filed the night of the arrest, police said they had
received a tip that Harkat, the Taliban and Al Qaeda were regrouping
in a Peshawar house.</TE>
<TE>   "These persons are engaged in terrorist activities and spreading
disinformation against the government," Assistant Inspector General
Abdul Majeed Marwat alleged. "It is presumed that these persons were
planning for mass destruction in Peshawar, and some VIPs were also on
their hit list."</TE>
<TE>   Khan made clear, however, that he doesn't intend to prosecute the
nine members of the group still in jail and trying to make bail of
about $5,000 each.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one of the two men released admitted in an interview at
his home in Hayatabad, near Peshawar, that he and the group's leader
are Harkat members. And he confirmed that police found explosives in
the house. The man spoke on the condition he not be identified
because his superiors hadn't approved the interview.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the 11 had returned recently from fighting Indian forces
in Jammu and Kashmir state, he said, adding that two members of the
group were Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Musharraf's promises to stop infiltrations into the
Indian-held portion of Kashmir, India and the United States say the
incursions continue.</TE>
<TE>   Sabir Hussain Awan, a Peshawar-area commander of Hizbul
Moujahedeen, a group fighting Indian rule in Kashmir that remains
legal in Pakistan, said Musharraf is facing domestic pressure to stop
restraining the militants.</TE>
<TE>   "People have lost patience already, and they can hardly wait
another seven or eight months," said Awan, who was elected to
Pakistan's National Assembly from a coalition of right-wing Islamic
parties. "After that, this issue will go out of control."</TE>
<TE>   The quiet release of the Harkat members in Peshawar is not the
only case in which efforts to crack down on terror suspects have been
thwarted.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 31, the government of Punjab province said it was allowing
Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, leader of the militant Lashkar-e-Taiba group,
to go home under a house arrest order that would expire in a month.
Saeed, whom India accuses of launching many terror attacks including
an assault on the Indian Parliament in New Delhi last December, had
last been seen more than five months ago when security forces
detained him.</TE>
<TE>   His wife said she was withdrawing a court petition asking for his
release because officials of the military's powerful Inter-Services
Intelligence agency, or ISI, had assured her he would be freed soon.</TE>
<TE>   The leader of another banned group was freed from prison the day
before, shortly after he was elected to the National Assembly. Azam
Tariq heads the Sipah-e-Sahaba, which Musharraf outlawed in January
because it was accused of killing hundreds of minority Shiite
Muslims. A court ordered Tariq released because the government had
not filed any charges.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, police arrested 12 members of Harkat and a local
leader of another banned group in North-West Frontier Province after
terrorists bombed a bus, injuring nine foreign tourists, most of them
Germans. Harkat once had a training base in the region.</TE>
<TE>   An ISI colonel pressured police to release the men, said a local
police official who spoke on the condition he not be identified. The
suspects were sent to Peshawar for interrogation by a team that
included ISI agents, he added. They were cleared and released, and
the bombing remains unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   The ISI's close ties to Harkat stem from the militant group's
founding in 1985 as one of the moujahedeen forces fighting the Soviet
occupation of Afghanistan. When the Soviet army pulled out of
Afghanistan four years later, Harkat shifted its jihad, or holy war,
to Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Harkat leader Fazlur Rehman Khalil joined Bin Laden in
signing a religious edict declaring it the duty of all Muslims to
wage holy war against Americans and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities have handled senior Harkat members very
carefully. Unlike other militant leaders, Khalil was not detained
when Musharraf banned Harkat and other groups in January. A
high-ranking anti-terrorism official said last spring that Khalil was
in an ISI "safe house." Another source said in October that his
whereabouts were unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Maulana Masood Azhar, another former Harkat leader, was moved from
jail to house arrest this year so that he could be with his family,
which is receiving about $170 a month in government support payments
because he can't work. Azhar has not been charged with any crime even
though he is suspected of having been involved in terrorism for a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   One of Azhar's disciples, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, was convicted
of masterminding the kidnapping and killing of American journalist
Daniel Pearl this year. Sheikh is in prison awaiting the appeal of a
death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf rejected Washington's request to extradite Sheikh, but
he did hand over two high-profile suspects caught in Pakistan: Al
Qaeda operations chief Abu Zubeida, who is thought to be a
Palestinian, and Ramzi Binalshibh, a Yemeni believed to have had a
major role in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan says it has turned over to the U.S. more than 420 Al
Qaeda suspects, most captured as they crossed from Afghanistan after
the Taliban collapsed last year. A list of 299 of them obtained from
a Pakistan government source includes citizens of 27 countries,
including an American of Syrian descent identified as Khalid Wazem
Diab, believed to be an aeronautical engineer. The Pakistani official
said Diab was interrogated and released, and his whereabouts were
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The list includes citizens of Australia, Britain, Germany, France
and Denmark. The majority are Afghans, Saudis and Yemenis.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some of Pakistan's home-grown radicals are branching
out, including a Harkat splinter group operating in Karachi that
added "al-Almi," or "international," to the name. Police blame the
group for a May suicide bombing that killed 11 French naval engineers
and a car bombing near the U.S. Consulate in Karachi that killed 11
Pakistanis, including the bomber.</TE>
<TE>   The Harkat member interviewed in Hayatabad said he believed that
the Al-Almi faction had about 100 members and that only about 24 had
been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   When Pakistan's 32 special anti-terrorism courts do attempt to put
suspects on trial, other problems occur. Raja Queshi, who won the
conviction of Pearl's killers, resigned this month as chief
prosecutor of Sindh province. No reason was given, but he previously
had said that he was getting constant death threats and that he had
moved his family out of Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to his resignation, he failed to turn up repeatedly for the
trial of five suspects in the consulate bombing, forcing its
postponement.</TE>
<TE>   Other anti-terrorism courts have concentrated on cases not
normally considered terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Khan, the Peshawar prosecutor, doesn't include the case of the 11
alleged Harkat members on his docket of seven anti-terrorism cases.
Among those he does include are the rape of a 12-year-old girl and
the killing of a dentist. Four of the seven cases date to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   While he focuses on those cases, several men are living in the
house where the 11 were arrested, behind a wall topped with barbed
wire in a neighborhood of Afghan refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the compound was sealed, but several people still live
there. A young man who answered the bell said they had nothing to do
with Harkat. But he glowered at a foreign visitor and angrily spit as
he walked back through the gate, next to a sign that warned:
"Outsiders not allowed without permission."</TE>

<HD>Ailing Dissident in Syria Is Released</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DAMASCUS, Syria</DL>
<LD>DAMASCUS, Syria -- President Bashar Assad unexpectedly freed a
prominent dissident from prison Saturday in what human rights
activists hope could be a sign that he means to resume a trend toward
greater freedom.</LD>
<LD>   Riyahd Turk, 74, who has diabetes and high blood pressure, was
released on humanitarian grounds, said a one-line announcement on the
government-owned Syrian Arab News Agency. He seemed in high spirits
as he made the 100-mile journey to his home city of Homs.</LD>
<LD>   "I spent one year, two months and 10 days in the five-star hotel,"
Turk joked in a telephone call, referring to Akra Prison outside
Damascus. "It was five-star treatment in prison -- but prison is a
prison."</LD>
<TE>   Turk said he was informed of his release when an army colonel
appeared Saturday morning and asked where he would like to be taken
in Damascus. He had had no inkling that a release was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Communist, Turk earned respect among Syrian opposition
figures for enduring 17 years in prison under the late President
Hafez Assad until being freed in 1998. He was one of 10 intellectuals
and human rights figures arrested in late summer of last year, in a
clampdown many here saw as the end of the "Damascus spring" under
Bashar Assad.</TE>
<TE>   Hafez Assad died in June 2000, and his then 34-year-old son,
Bashar, a British-educated ophthalmologist, was chosen by the ruling
Baath Party to succeed him. After assuming power, Bashar Assad seemed
set to unleash a string of political and economic reforms. He ordered
the release of more than 600 political prisoners, issued economic
decrees and permitted freedom of political expression.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the discussions exceeded what the Syrian government --
led by the secular, Arab nationalist, socialist-leaning Baathist
movement -- felt it could tolerate. The arrest of Turk and nine other
reformers in August and September 2001 put the brakes on the
free-speech euphoria, which seemed to coincide with a slowdown in
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Turk was arrested for telling a forum that Hafez Assad's 30 years
in power had stagnated the country. Charged with attempting to change
the constitution, inciting religious strife, spreading false
information and slandering Syria, he was originally sentenced to five
years.</TE>
<TE>   A Damascus professional, asking not to be identified, said
Saturday that he believes Turk "was sent to prison for [using] one
word: dictator." He said that Turk had used it in an interview with
the Qatar-based television station Al Jazeera to refer to the
president's father, Hafez Assad, and that this was the catalyst for
Turk's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   After his release Saturday, Turk was unapologetic. "Why should the
security apparatus arrest people for openly saying their opinions?"
he asked. He said he would continue his political work "until my
death."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very positive step that has both political and
humanitarian implications," said Aktham Naisse, founder of the
Committee for the Defense of Human Rights in Syria. Speaking by
telephone from his home in Latakia, Naisse said he hopes it will be
followed by other amnesties or commutations for political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Naisse's group believes there are 800 prisoners in Syria who could
be considered "political" -- almost all the arrests dating from
before Bashar Assad's ascent.</TE>
<TE>   "It is well-known that Turk has political views that oppose the
government. That is why this release has great political
significance," Naisse said. "And that is why we think and hope that
this step will be followed by other steps."</TE>
<TE>   Naisse, who spent 1991-98 in prison for founding the human rights
committee in 1991, said he was not surprised when the government
clamped down on dissident voices last year.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, Syria was not very ready to have democratic trends,
and the democratic trends that existed were not too deep," he said.
Asked whether he thought such trends would take hold this time, he
said, "We hope so."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday also was a key date for the regime, the anniversary of
when Hafez Assad and a group of military officers assumed power in
1970. Festivities included a memorial at Assad's tomb near his home
outside Latakia.</TE>

<HD>Bush Notes Progress in War on Terrorism</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite evidence that Osama bin Laden is alive and plotting new
attacks, President Bush on Saturday claimed great progress in the war
on terrorism, touting thousands of arrests and vowing that "no
terrorist will escape" the global manhunt.</LD>
<LD>   "Our war against terrorists and their supporters is advancing on
all fronts," Bush said in his weekly radio address, a day after U.S.
government sources reported the capture of a high-ranking Al Qaeda
leader, who was not immediately identified.</LD>
<LD>   The White House's aggressive defense of its anti-terrorism
campaign followed Democratic charges that Bush had little to show for
his efforts to dismantle Al Qaeda and an ominous FBI warning that Bin
Laden's militant network may be plotting "spectacular" new attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The Arabic satellite station Al Jazeera reported Saturday that it
received a six-page document from Al Qaeda threatening terrorist
attacks unless Americans stop supporting Israel and other governments
that "oppress" Muslims. The station said it believed the document was
genuine because it arrived in the same manner as past communications
from Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in Kuwait, police arrested a senior member of Al Qaeda
who was helping to plan a car bomb attack on a Yemeni hotel
frequented by Americans, according to Al-Anba, a usually
authoritative Kuwaiti newspaper. The suspect is a 21-year-old Kuwaiti
identified only by the initials "M.F."</TE>
<TE>   Roughly half of the top two dozen Al Qaeda leaders have been
killed or captured since the Sept. 11 attacks, although the
whereabouts of Bin Laden remain unknown.</TE>
<TE>   This month, an unmanned CIA aircraft fired a missile at a car in
Yemen and killed six suspected Al Qaeda members. Suspected senior Al
Qaeda leaders Abu Zubeida and Ramzi Binalshibh were caught in
separate operations in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to keep America safe from terrorism is to go after
terrorists where they plan and hide," Bush said.</TE>

<HD>Turkish Moderate Becomes Premier</HD>
<DH>The Islamic party's second-in-command will form a
government and 'get down to work.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amberin Zaman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>A moderate member of the Islamic-rooted party that won nationwide
elections this month was asked Saturday by Turkey's firmly
pro-secular president to form a new government.</LD>
<LD>   Abdullah Gul -- an economist and the second-highest-ranking member
of the Justice and Development Party, or AKP, which swept to victory
in Nov. 3 polls -- vowed to establish a government swiftly, saying it
would tackle Turkey's multiple problems immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Ensuring that the country is admitted to the European Union and
solving the long-running dispute over the divided Mediterranean
island of Cyprus would be among his government's top priorities, Gul
said.</LD>
<TE>   "It is time to get down to work. It is time to work day and night
and mobilize to solve the problems of our people," the 52-year-old
former banker said.</TE>
<TE>   Gul's nomination was welcomed by Western diplomats here in the
capital, who described him as reliable, pragmatic and a friend of the
West.</TE>
<TE>   "He was clearly the best choice. We know and trust him. He speaks
our language," said a senior European diplomat who asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's sole
predominantly Muslim member and Israel's closest regional ally. The
country is expected to be a key player in any U.S. military operation
to overthrow Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Even before his designation as prime minister, Gul reassured
Turkey's Western allies that the country would defer to the views of
its pro-Western armed forces on what its contribution should be to a
war on its southern neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   Gul's role, however, is expected to be more one of a caretaker
premier until Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the charismatic AKP leader, can
take over.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan, whose popularity helped propel the party to power, is
unable to do so now because he was convicted in 1998 of seeking to
"stir religious hatred" with a nationalist poem he recited during a
rally.</TE>
<TE>   That sentence cost him his job as mayor of Istanbul in 1998,
landed him in prison for four months and barred him from running for
parliament.</TE>
<TE>   Under Turkish law, only elected lawmakers are eligible for the
post of prime minister. However, the new parliament, dominated by the
AKP, is expected to push for amendments to the country's repressive
constitution, which was drawn up by the military in 1980 after it
seized power for a third time.</TE>
<TE>   "We will overcome legal obstacles to Mr. Erdogan's premiership,"
said Murat Mercan, a senior party official widely expected to become
a minister in the new Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   "It is his right, and that is what the Turkish people expect,"
Mercan said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Gul suggested that he would be willing to step down in favor of
Erdogan. "This situation is abnormal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he holds no office, Erdogan remains firmly in control
of his party. On Saturday, as Gul was meeting with President Ahmet
Necdet Sezer, Erdogan was outlining the AKP's program at a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan too pledged to press ahead with reforms aimed at securing
Turkey's long-cherished goal of joining the European Union, including
reducing widespread torture to "zero level." He promised to crack
down on corruption and to make the government more open and
accountable. He also pledged to largely abide by a radical fiscal
recovery program supported by the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "We are building a new world," Erdogan said. "And this new world
will bring the East and West together in Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   Western governments and Turkey's business community have welcomed
a single-party government.</TE>
<TE>   The AKP will be the first party to rule without a coalition since
1987, after which a series of shaky coalitions brought the country to
the brink of economic collapse. Economic mismanagement and widespread
corruption among government officials and the country's old guard of
politicians, none of whom was voted back into parliament, are
regarded as the main factors that led to the AKP's stunning electoral
success.</TE>
<TE>   EU leaders are especially hopeful that the AKP will help break the
deadlock that has kept Cyprus divided since Turkish troops intervened
on the island in 1974 in the wake of a coup by Greek Cypriot
ultranationalists aimed at annexing it to Greece.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan, who was on a daylong visit Saturday to the
Turkish-controlled northern third of Cyprus, added to such hopes by
saying he endorsed in principle the outlines of a U.N.-brokered peace
plan released last week.</TE>
<TE>   Progress on Cyprus would, in turn, increase Turkey's chances of
being given an official date for starting accession talks with the EU
when its leaders meet in Copenhagen next month.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan's repeated disavowals of the AKP's Islamic roots have
helped ease suspicions among the pro-secular Turkish elite that under
the party, the country would move away from the determinedly westward
course set by the founder of modern Turkey, Kemal Ataturk.</TE>

<HD>President of Ukraine Sacks Government</HD>
<DH>Critics say Kuchma's shake-up is a ploy to deflect
attention from scandals such as his alleged sale of a radar system to
Iraq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>MOSCOW -- Beleaguered Ukrainian President Leonid D. Kuchma, accused
by the U.S. of approving the sale of early warning radar to Iraq, on
Saturday fired his country's prime minister and government.</LD>
<LD>   Kuchma has been embroiled in successive political scandals in
recent years. His decision to replace the prime minister, Anatoly
Kinakh, with a tough regional governor was seen by analysts as an
effort to stave off his current political problems and regain
control.</LD>
<LD>   Kuchma has dismissed other prime ministers or prominent ministers
amid similar crises.</LD>
<TE>   The Ukrainian leader told Russia's Interfax news agency that
Kinakh and his government were incapable of solving the country's
social problems.</TE>
<TE>   He named a powerful regional governor, Viktor Yanukovich, as his
candidate to head the government. Yanukovich, 52, is governor of
Donetsk, Ukraine's heavily industrialized eastern region, the site of
huge Soviet-era coal mines, steel smelters and chemical plants.</TE>
<TE>   After Saturday's move, analysts were speculating that Yanukovich
is now well placed to succeed Kuchma as president in elections due in
2004. Kuchma is not eligible to run.</TE>
<TE>   The government's removal was widely expected after parliamentary
factions last week put forward Yanukovich's name for the job along
with those of several other candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Critics characterized the Kinakh government as weak and
indecisive, while Kuchma attacked it last week for inadequate funding
of Ukrainian culture.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier speech, in August, the president had called on the
government to increase wages, pensions and medical assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Time has gone by but practically nothing has been done," Kuchma
told Interfax on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Yanukovich, a close Kuchma ally, is regarded as a tough and
ruthless leader who will boost Kuchma's ailing position.</TE>
<TE>   The president was severely damaged when U.S. officials accused him
of approving the sale of a Kolchuga radar system to Iraq for $100
million in breach of U.N. sanctions, an accusation he denies.</TE>
<TE>   The accusation was based on tapes allegedly made by a former
Kuchma bodyguard in the president's office.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. accepts the tapes as genuine and has suspended $54
million in aid to Ukraine. Kuchma had already been hurt by
allegations that he played a role in the murder of a Ukrainian
investigative journalist several years ago. Allegations that he
ordered the journalist's killing also surfaced in the secret tapes.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma has recently faced mass protests calling for his dismissal,
while the North Atlantic Treaty Organization snubbed him last week,
declining to invite him to a key meeting of the NATO-Ukraine
Commission at this week's alliance summit in Prague, the Czech
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchma acknowledged Friday that U.S. officials had pressured him
to stay away but announced Saturday that he would attend anyway.</TE>
<TE>   One prominent Ukrainian opposition figure and Kuchma critic, Yulia
Timoshenko, contended that Kuchma had dismissed the government in
order to deflect attention from his problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Kuchma is trying to create a decoy to distract the public's
attention from the scandal connected with the illegal arms trade and
the fact that world leaders shun him," Timoshenko said in a
statement. "If there is a resignation that could improve the
situation in Ukraine for the better today, it is only the immediate,
voluntary and unconditional resignation of Kuchma himself."</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Yulia Mostovaya, who is based in Kiev, the
Ukrainian capital, maintained that Kuchma, under severe political
pressure, is trying to consolidate power by forging an alliance
between two powerful political clans -- one headed by Yanukovich, the
other by a popular opposition politician and former prime minister,
Viktor Yushchenko.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite possible that Yanukovich may succeed in splitting the
opposition ranks and winning Yushchenko and his faction over to his
side, a political and economic tandem which could become virtually
invincible in Ukraine," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mostovaya said Yanukovich is associated with one of the most
powerful political and financial clans in Ukraine, known as the
Donetsk clan.</TE>
<TE>   "Kuchma decided to drop Kinakh -- who has always been pretty weak
as a politician and as an economic manager -- and replace him with
Viktor Yanukovich, a man who proved many times that he is capable of
pursuing a very tough, unscrupulous and even ruthless line as a
politician and regional governor," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said Yanukovich has a reputation as a man who would not
hesitate to take tough measures to resolve the country's problems.</TE>

<HD>Chavez Takes Over Caracas City Police</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>The government of President Hugo Chavez sent troops and armored
vehicles Saturday to seize control of the Caracas city police from
the capital's anti-Chavez mayor, drawing furious condemnation from
political opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, gunfights broke out between rival police factions before
National Guard troops backed by personnel carriers armed with machine
guns deployed to take over police headquarters and other major
stations around the city.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover inflamed the long-running political feud between
leftist Chavez and foes opposed to his self-proclaimed revolution in
Venezuela. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello ordered the autonomous
8,000-member city police to report to Chavez's government instead of
to Caracas Mayor Alfredo Pena, a die-hard foe of the populist
president.</LD>
<TE>   Around police headquarters in Caracas' northern Cotiza
neighborhood, officers loyal to Pena and opposed to the takeover
exchanged fire with colleagues inside the building who supported the
move. Heavy gunfire echoed in the streets around the headquarters. No
injuries were immediately reported.</TE>
<TE>   The government said the takeover was necessary to guarantee law
and order in the capital and the smooth running of the city's police,
which had been hit by a strike by some officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the victim of a coup d'etat by the government," Pena said,
refusing to accept the takeover of his police force.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, who was democratically elected in 1998 and survived a
short-lived coup by rebel armed forces officers in April, is
resisting intense opposition pressure to hold an immediate referendum
on his rule.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion, the new city police chief initially named
by the government to take over the force abruptly resigned and
declared his continued loyalty to Pena.</TE>
<TE>   The government promptly named another chief, Gonzalo Sanchez, who
urged all members of the force to lay down their arms and accept the
government takeover.</TE>

<HD>Kidnapped by Her Grandparents and Raised on the Run</HD>
<DH>Still in hiding, they feared the young girl was being
sexually abused. At 18, Kaylee Lopez seeks to begin living a normal
life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mitchell Landsberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a steamy August afternoon in 1989, Irene and Raul Lopez packed up
a travel trailer, picked up their granddaughter and began driving
north out of the Florida Everglades to a new life in hiding.</LD>
<LD>   They had been preparing in secret for two months. They had sold
their land, a lush tangle of saw grass and holly shaded by ficus
trees, for a pittance in cash. They had jettisoned the fiberglass
business they built after fleeing Cuba in the early 1960s. To confuse
pursuers, they had traded in their car.</LD>
<LD>   As they edged their trailer onto the two-lane blacktop, the sun
glared savagely off the drainage canals. Fish surfaced with a gurgle,
grazing air that was scarcely drier than the water.</LD>
<TE>   They were off.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen years later, they are still in hiding, the three of them,
somewhere in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee Nicole Lopez was 5 years old -- bubbly, green-eyed and
precocious -- when her grandparents spirited her away. They did it,
they said, to protect her from sexual abuse at the hands of both her
father and stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   Or did they?</TE>
<TE>   Today, it seems almost impossible to piece together the truth of
Kaylee's life story, refracted as it is through a small girl's
long-ago memory, the conflicting statements of adults on all sides
and a fragmentary legal record.</TE>
<TE>   She is 18 now, a dark-haired, thoughtful, emotionally fragile
young woman who looks strikingly like the age-enhanced photograph
circulated by law enforcement officials two years ago. Since her
birthday in February, Kaylee has taken shaky steps into the open, to
establish a normal life and use her real name -- to put her ordeal
behind her.</TE>
<TE>   She fears, however, that her freedom will come at the expense of
her grandparents, who are still being sought by state and federal
authorities for violating child custody laws.</TE>
<TE>   Many children who were taken under similar circumstances in the
late 1980s are now, like Kaylee, entering adulthood and facing
fundamental questions: Who am I? What is my name? Who can I trust?</TE>
<TE>   "I can talk to people and have the most normal conversation,"
Kaylee said one recent morning, "and they can say something and
suddenly I'm crying uncontrollably. It's like when you're playing
with your friends and they're hitting you with a pillow. It's this
terrifying feeling, like you're being dragged under and you can't
breathe."</TE>
<TE>   She spoke in her lawyer's office in Redondo Beach, a nun at her
side. The nun, who was introduced as Sister Mary, a fictitious name,
has been Kaylee's shepherd through the last 12 years of her
underground existence. As Kaylee talked, Sister Mary stroked her
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking with assurance, her tone flush with indignation, Kaylee
unfurled an autobiography of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 1, she said, her mother abandoned her.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 2, she said, her grandparents discovered that her
father, who had moved into their house, was sexually abusing her.
They kicked him out.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 4, she said, her mother reclaimed her -- and then
watched while Kaylee's new stepfather sexually abused her.</TE>
<TE>   When she was 5, she said, her grandparents saved her.</TE>
<TE>   She said she doesn't remember specific acts of abuse by her
father, but does recall the awful feeling she had when he was around.</TE>
<TE>   "The first memory I have of him, I was running through the house
trying to find something to hide under because I didn't want to be
near him," she said. "I was terrified. I was petrified of being near
him."</TE>
<TE>   As for her stepfather, she said, she can picture him abusing her.
He would come into her room at night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hazy," she said, but "I know what happened to me, and I know
who did it. The memories and associations of pain and fear that I
went through -- it's unmistakable to me what caused them, and who."</TE>
<TE>   Underground Network</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee and her grandparents, who recounted their story in a series
of interviews over the spring and summer, left Florida at the height
of a national panic over child sexual abuse. There were horrifying
accusations of abuse at such places as the McMartin Pre-School in
Manhattan Beach and the Little Rascals Day Care Center in Edenton,
N.C. Although most of the allegations were later discredited, they
fostered a sense of anxiety among parents nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, an underground organization sprang up to help
people -- mothers, mostly -- who believed that their children were
being abused by the other parent. If courts wound up siding with the
alleged abusers, these parents would kidnap their own children. A
coast-to-coast network, Children of the Underground, offered shelter
and helped runaway parents rebuild their lives under new names.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the abducting parents were wrong; their spouses were not
abusers. Some parents would say anything -- and believe anything --
to justify their quest for sole custody of their children. But
Children of the Underground, led by an outspoken Georgia woman, Faye
Yager, believed the child welfare system was stacked in favor of
child abusers. To protect the children, the group contended, parents
-- or grandparents -- would have to become outlaws.</TE>
<TE>   The Lopezes' story is rooted in a bitter custody battle in the
family court system of Dade County, which takes in Miami and its
environs. The voluminous case file was sealed by a judge, a standard
practice in such cases in Florida. So the accounts of the
participants, along with scattered documents they provided, offer the
only window into what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Irene Lopez offered her version in a series of telephone
interviews arranged by the grandparents' lawyer. The location from
which she was calling, and many details of the Lopezes' lives, were
masked by the lawyer to protect the couple from arrest.</TE>
<TE>   By Irene Lopez's account, she and her husband had effectively been
Kaylee's parents since 1985, when the girl was a year old. The
grandparents say Kaylee's mother, whom they describe as selfish,
irresponsible and promiscuous, had abandoned her.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, they came to believe their son was abusing his
daughter while living under their roof. They took her for a medical
examination. Doctors found no sign of sexual abuse, but the Lopezes
remained certain it had happened. They said they could tell from
Kaylee's behavior. "The way she acted," Irene Lopez said. "I don't
know if I can explain more than that."</TE>
<TE>   Their son, Raul Jr., was a stocky ex-Marine in his early 20s who
was having emotional and financial troubles after splitting up with
his wife. As difficult as it was, Irene Lopez said, "we asked him to
leave the house."</TE>
<TE>   For the next few years, the grandparents had temporary legal
custody of Kaylee. A judge granted visitation rights to the girl's
mother, who was remarrying.</TE>
<TE>   When Kaylee began spending time at her mother's, the grandparents
grew to suspect she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. She
begged not to go, Irene Lopez said, and each time she returned, her
speech had regressed. After one such visit, the grandparents said,
they took Kaylee to a rape treatment center, where a doctor found
evidence of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that evidence, they went back to family court, demanding
custody. A judge ordered another psychologist to examine the girl.
That doctor, the grandparents said, discounted their allegations, and
the judge awarded full custody to the mother and stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   In desperation, Irene Lopez called Faye Yager.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me that she needed proof that we were abused by the
legal system, that was the only way she would help us," the
grandmother recalled. "So I sent her, Federal Express, all the papers
from court....</TE>
<TE>   "We flew to Atlanta, Ga., and we waited in a hotel until she was
able to come. It was after midnight, and she spent the whole night
explaining many things.... She told us how to do everything."</TE>
<TE>   They returned to Florida and began laying their plans. They picked
up Kaylee from her mother on the afternoon of Aug. 11, 1989, for a
birthday dinner. The grandparents were both turning 50 within the
next two days.</TE>
<TE>   They said they'd have her back by 8:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Their first stop was Atlanta, where someone in the underground
gave them the address of an RV park. Yager came to see them there,
and gave them their next destination: North Carolina, where they
could park the trailer in a yard. They were given a phone number and
a code to use whenever they needed to call the underground.</TE>
<TE>   From North Carolina, they were told to go to New York City for an
appearance on the "Geraldo" TV show.</TE>
<TE>   "It was stupid, you know," Irene Lopez said. "We shouldn't have
done that."</TE>
<TE>   The grandparents disguised themselves with ill-fitting wigs and
sunglasses for a show titled "Mothers Running from the Devil."
Kaylee, too, wore oversized sunglasses. In an interview with host
Geraldo Rivera, Raul Lopez Sr. described how Kaylee had been sexually
molested "by our own son -- my own son! -- and by her own mother and
her stepfather." Then he dropped a bombshell.</TE>
<TE>   After they left Florida, the grandfather told Rivera, Kaylee
"started talking and telling us all about the cult and the human
sacrifice and the blood that she'd been drinking, and all that."</TE>
<TE>   With that, he was cut off -- the show was over.</TE>
<TE>   "This," declared Rivera, "cries for a congressional
investigation!"</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Lopezes' lawyer, Carl A. "Tony" Capozzola, says they
were coached to make those claims. "Words were put in their mouth,"
Capozzola said. "There was nothing satanic."</TE>
<TE>   But Kaylee said her grandparents were telling the truth. "Yes,"
she said, breaking into sobs. "I don't think a child of that age
would make something like that up."</TE>
<TE>   Nun Becomes Mentor</TE>
<TE>   After "Geraldo," the Lopezes went from New York to North Carolina
to Michigan to South Dakota, stopping to pick up fake identification
from a woman in the underground.</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee remembers Mt. Rushmore and Niagara Falls. "It was like this
big, elongated camping trip," she said. "It was nice. It was like I
was safe and nothing could happen."</TE>
<TE>   They spent their first Christmas in Texas. Raul Sr., who has
skills as a fiberglass craftsman and a heavy equipment operator,
found a job. Those were good times, Irene said, until she went to the
mailbox one day and found fliers scattered on the ground. "Missing,"
it said. "Kaylee Nicole Lopez." There was Kaylee's picture.</TE>
<TE>   They left Texas that day. Southern California would be the last
stop on their journey. It had been a year since they left Florida. By
this time, Irene Lopez said, they had grown disenchanted with the
Children of the Underground. They were being asked to move too often.</TE>
<TE>   "You know," she said, "the important thing not to be found is ...
a good cover-up, good papers, you have to build up a good history."</TE>
<TE>   The papers they were given by the underground looked phony, she
said. So Irene Lopez, a housewife who said she'd never even cheated
on her taxes, found a book on forgery and made new documents --
including a driver's license for Raul Sr.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in Southern California in the late summer of 1990, they
went to a large church. There, Irene said, they spoke to a Catholic
bishop -- she won't say which one. That contact led them to Sister
Mary, a principal at a Catholic elementary school. She made
arrangements to admit Kaylee, then 6, into kindergarten under a fake
name. The nun became the family's guide and mentor.</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee's years in Southern California are reminiscent of some
veterans' descriptions of war: hours of boredom, moments of terror. A
strange normality settled over her life at her grandparents' mobile
home. She developed friendships, including one with a girl she
trusted enough to tell her life story. She spent a lot of time
reading. Beneath it all was an ever-present sense of being on the
run.</TE>
<TE>   About six years ago, the Lopezes were living in a trailer park in
Anaheim, not far from Disneyland. Kaylee was 12 or 13 and attending
Catholic school.</TE>
<TE>   One evening, two Anaheim police officers came to the door, asking
for Irene and Kaylee Lopez. Raul Lopez Sr. said there was nobody
there by those names. Kaylee was going by the name Christina. The
officers asked to speak to her alone.</TE>
<TE>   Had she ever heard the name Kaylee Lopez?</TE>
<TE>   No, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Had she ever been to Florida?</TE>
<TE>   No.</TE>
<TE>   Were the people in the trailer her family?</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I said was, 'Can I go inside now? I'm watching
"Jeopardy" and I want to see if the archeologist wins,' " Kaylee
recalled. It was, and is, her ambition to become an archeologist.</TE>
<TE>   The Lopezes moved that night.</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee stopped going to school -- it had become too risky -- and
began home schooling.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were to write a book about our lives," Irene Lopez said in
her soft Cuban accent, "it would be called 'Running.' We ran from
communists, we ran for our lives from the legal system.... We've run
from all those things."</TE>
<TE>   Her voice turned defiant. She scoffed at the authorities who
refused to believe them and then, once they were gone, weren't smart
enough to find them.</TE>
<TE>   "They underestimated us," she said. "We were the paranoid
grandparents, and they underestimated the power of love and the power
of the light of God....</TE>
<TE>   "I know no one will believe it, but there was a big light in front
of us when we left. I was reading the Bible. We were very scared. My
husband waked me up because I fell asleep from time to time. And he
said, 'I'm going to turn off the lights and tell me if you see a
light.' ... We turned off the lights and we could see the road far
away. It was unbelievable. We felt like that light was guiding us."</TE>
<TE>   Restoring Kaylee's Identity</TE>
<TE>   At first, Tony Capozzola thought the Lopezes' story sounded
unlikely: "The grandparents are going to give up their lives, live as
fugitives, just to have this girl live with them? Does that make
sense to you?"</TE>
<TE>   Capozzola is a Redondo Beach attorney whose ocean-view office is
as brash and outsized as its occupant. He had heard the grandparents'
story from Sister Mary, who is an acquaintance of his. They needed
his help, she said, to restore Kaylee's identity and help settle the
charges against them.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his skepticism, Capozzola agreed to look into it. "Believe
me," he would say later, "I've looked at this from every angle,
including that you've got some psycho grandparents."</TE>
<TE>   The Lopezes showed him a 1988 evaluation from the rape treatment
center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, where the grandparents
took Kaylee after suspecting that her stepfather was abusing her.
"Child spent weekend with ... stepfather," the report said. "When she
came home she was red down there." It went on to describe how the
girl told of being abused with a stick.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a letter written about the same time by Simon
Miranda, a Miami psychologist retained by the grandparents. After
months of denials, he reported, the girl had come to him "in a more
disclosing attitude" and described in graphic detail how her
stepfather had abused her. The child, he said, belonged with her
grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after hearing Kaylee's account, Capozzola came to
believe.</TE>
<TE>   "The things that she was saying to me, in terms of the detail, and
then the absolute terror that she still goes through, she can't be
coached on that," he said. "You know that somebody was abusing her
physically."</TE>
<TE>   Loss Stuns Raul Jr.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent hot and humid day in Florida, Kaylee's father, Raul
Lopez Jr., hopped the barbed-wire fence that surrounds his parents'
old property, in the Redlands area southwest of Miami, and landed in
knee-high grass. "I'm not trying to scare you," he said, "but there's
snakes out here. There's alligators."</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. is 40, a chatty, boyish-faced man who has retained the
crisp manner and haircut of a Marine, even as the barrel chest of his
youth has rolled toward his waist.</TE>
<TE>   To him, this patch of reclaimed swamp, still deserted and littered
with the wreckage of his father's fiberglass shop, is both hallowed
and cursed. Raul Jr. grew up here with two sisters, he said, under
the domineering control of his parents, Raul Sr. and Irene.</TE>
<TE>   By his account and those of family members and friends, it was a
difficult childhood. His father, said Raul Jr., had a raging temper
and beat the children, either with his fists or with a length of
black hose he kept in a closet. His sisters, Raul added, were not
allowed to have boyfriends.</TE>
<TE>   "When we spoke to my father, we had to stand at attention and look
down -- we couldn't look him in the eyes," he said. "We weren't a
normal family."</TE>
<TE>   "They were very abused kids," said Raul Jr.'s aunt, Odilia Lopez,
who has known the senior Lopezes since the three of them were young
together in Cuba. "If they asked for water, they would get slapped in
the face."</TE>
<TE>   Through their lawyer, the grandparents rejected these assertions.
Capozzola said the couple denied ever abusing their son, despite what
they described as his "uncontrollable" behavior as a youth.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. had come to his parents' house that August night 13 years
ago. He had gotten a call from his ex-wife, Lora Coleman, saying the
grandparents hadn't returned Kaylee.</TE>
<TE>   "I got out there and everything was dark, man, out in the middle
of nowhere.... When I ran up to the house and I saw that there were
no curtains -- it's like, you hear a freight train going by and all
of a sudden you get those butterflies in your stomach and your legs
get icy cold. It was just a real bad feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. waited all night, thinking there must be some mistake.
"With the sun up and daylight, it was very apparent." His parents had
taken his child.</TE>
<TE>   The loss, in one bitter moment, of both his parents and his
daughter plunged Raul Jr. into a deep depression. At first, he
couldn't work, he said. When he could, his boss at a computer service
company accommodated him with a less demanding assignment.
Ultimately, he regained his equilibrium by dedicating himself to
finding his daughter. When he had an opportunity to become a
Miami-based Latin American sales representative for a Chinese
computer company, he grabbed it and used it as a launching pad for
his search.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several years, by Raul Jr.'s account, he looked for
Kaylee in the United States, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela,
Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, there was a logic behind his search. In Argentina, he
looked up long-lost relatives -- had they heard anything from Raul
Sr. and Irene? In other places, he said, he was flying on a hunch and
a prayer. In every country, he tried to make friends with police,
pressing into their hands stacks of handbills with Kaylee's picture.
Who knew when it might pay off?</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, back home in Florida, he'd take a drive out into the
Everglades, out past his parents' old land, out past the mango and
coconut groves to where no one could hear him.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping out of his car, he would turn his face to the sky and
yell at God.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate you! I hate you, man!"</TE>
<TE>   Last year, not long after he was "born again" as an evangelical
Christian, Raul Jr. quit his job, tired of the traveling that kept
him from his second wife, Helena, and his two sons, who are Kaylee's
half-brothers. He is now president of a Miami company that
reconditions, sells and services computers. Recently, he established
a Web site, kayleelopez.com, aimed at telling Kaylee about her
family.</TE>
<TE>   "Kaylee, our dad has always told us about you," reads a typical
passage from her half-brothers, 9-year-old Kyle and 11-year-old
Adrian. "We pray for you every night before we go to bed. We often
wonder where you could be and we wish you could have seen us at our
Karate Competition Tournaments.... It was way cool."</TE>
<TE>   A Mother's Heartbreak</TE>
<TE>   Like Raul Jr., Lora Coleman was shattered by the loss of her
daughter. The night Kaylee disappeared, she stayed up all night.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman is portrayed by the elder Lopezes as a wild woman,
reckless and depraved. It is not a description that appears to fit
her today. She is calm and reasoned; her face, framed by
reddish-blond hair, radiates quiet concern. She agreed to be
interviewed only reluctantly, saying she didn't want Kaylee to learn
the truth about her family from a newspaper story. She spoke
cautiously and declined to provide documents that might bolster her
position, although she alone, it appears, saved most of the papers
from the custody dispute.</TE>
<TE>   For her, the case was a cog's-eye view into the machinery of the
child welfare system. "My goal, if I survived this, was that I was
going into social work," she said in an interview at the south Miami
home she shares with her two younger daughters, Kaylee's
half-sisters.</TE>
<TE>   After she got over the shock of Kaylee's disappearance, she said,
"I got up, dusted off my britches and went back to school." She
earned a master's degree in social work and has been working in that
field for the last three years, two of them in a child welfare unit
in Dade County.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman is originally from Kentucky, a descendant of the
Hatfields, whose feud with the McCoys is part of American lore. She
and Raul were high school sweethearts in Miami who married when she
was 17. He was 18 and a Marine on active duty at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
They returned to Miami not long after Kaylee's birth.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. blames the stresses of military life for destroying their
marriage. Coleman blames Raul Jr. "The situation I was in ... was not
good, was not healthy," she said. "It was one where I often feared
for my life and my safety."</TE>
<TE>   Told that Kaylee recalled being terrified of her father, Coleman
said, "I have memories of being terrified of Raul too."</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr., she said, was deeply under the sway of his parents. She
said she decided to divorce him when, on the first Mother's Day after
Kaylee was born, Raul Jr. took Kaylee to be with his parents for the
day, leaving Coleman alone.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Lopezes, she said, always had a fixation with Kaylee:
"From the moment I became pregnant, it was like it was their child."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said she never abandoned Kaylee, as the grandparents
claimed. In fact, after she left Raul Jr., she said, his parents made
it impossible for her to see her daughter. "They would literally lock
the gate," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also worried about the conditions under which Kaylee was
living, in a dilapidated mobile home with no window screens.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. was also living there. At his parents' urging, he sought
and was granted sole custody of Kaylee. At the time, he was working
two jobs and going to school.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he said, he began to think Kaylee belonged with her
mother. He considered moving to New York to be out of his parents'
shadow.</TE>
<TE>   Before he could act, he said, child welfare officials received an
anonymous accusation that he had sexually abused Kaylee.</TE>
<TE>   Parents Tip Police</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. is a man who seems, in some ways, uncertain of himself.
He apologizes frequently. With strangers, he is polite to a fault.
But he is absolutely adamant about one thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not sexually molest my daughter," he said. "It turns my
stomach how somebody could do something so horrific.... I underwent
countless hours of evaluation by the state psychologist. I underwent
polygraphs, I was willing to do whatever."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he was cleared of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Raul Jr. said, he assumed that his ex-wife had made
the accusation against him. Only later, he said, did his lawyer show
him a transcript of a 911 call that identified his parents as the
tipsters.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I am, I'm in the middle of one of the worst periods of my
life. I'm going through a divorce. I'm a young man, I'm totally
confused ... and all I did was go to my parents for help," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Coleman said, the grandparents "just started
allegation after allegation against everybody." When she and her new
husband, Allen Cribbs, got visitation rights for Kaylee to spend the
night with them, Cribbs became the target of an anonymous charge.</TE>
<TE>   This is the most detailed allegation of abuse. It is the one the
grandparents have bolstered with the evaluation from the Jackson
Memorial Hospital rape treatment center and with Miranda's
psychological report.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Dorothy Hicks examined Kaylee at the rape center. Now retired,
Hicks said she doesn't remember the case. But when she heard a
description of the single-page document the grandparents turned over
to Capozzola, their attorney, she said it sounded odd. There should
be a second page, Hicks said, containing her conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   On the document given to Capozzola, many of the details of the
examination of Kaylee are illegible. Kaylee's description of her
stepfather placing a stick on her genitals is the only part that is
legible.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman and Cribbs insist that the second page of Hicks' report
contained the conclusion that Kaylee had not been sexually abused.
They refused, however, to provide a copy. Coleman said it seemed
improper to divulge such personal details.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach the grandparents for comment on this issue were
unsuccessful. Capozzola said they did not want to discuss their case
further.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Hicks' evaluation, Miranda's report is quite
legible, and it makes for unsettling reading. It graphically repeats
Kaylee's accusations against her stepfather and quotes her use of
obscene language, and her grandparents' assertion that her vocabulary
was becoming rife with sexual overtones.</TE>
<TE>   "She also stated that she did not want to live with her mother,"
the report said. It quoted Kaylee: " 'Cause ... I am scared of her."</TE>
<TE>   Miranda also wrote that he spoke to Hicks after she examined
Kaylee and that the doctor reported "findings consistent with
molestation."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Coleman, Cribbs and Raul Lopez Jr. all say they
believe Kaylee was coached to say she had been molested. Further,
they said, she may believe today that she remembers something that
never occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been brainwashing this kid since she was a little
infant," Coleman said.</TE>
<TE>   Cribbs, who was divorced from Coleman last year, is an affable,
deeply tanned man with a goatee who still lives in the house where
Kaylee was living when she was whisked off by her grandparents. He
was a carpenter then, he said, and is now a general contractor. When
he was accused of abuse, he and Coleman had recently married and had
their first daughter. A child welfare worker came to their house at 3
a.m., he said, to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he was cleared.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, that didn't happen," was all he would say about the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Although his relations with Cribbs are uneasy, Raul Jr. is almost
as insistent about the stepfather's innocence as he is about his own.
He praised Cribbs as a good father who never would have abused
Kaylee. "I know he didn't do it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset of his report, Miranda noted that "for many months,
Kaylee has been denying that anyone ever had touched her ... and was
basically avoidant around the issue of sexual behavior."</TE>
<TE>   One of the lessons of the McMartin case and others is that
children, if repeatedly prompted, will say almost anything they think
adults want to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "When you interview children, you have to be very cautious,"
Coleman said. "Now that I'm a professional, I can see that this is an
abuse, bombarding a child with this information." By repeatedly
asking Kaylee if she was abused, Miranda might have helped plant the
idea in her head, Coleman believes.</TE>
<TE>   Miranda, who is still practicing in Miami, did not return repeated
telephone calls.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Kaylee's story comes down to a matter of trust, of
faith. With few events documented, with the most compelling
information coming from a psychologist hired by the grandparents, the
search for proof follows the same path as the road that runs past the
Lopezes' old home: straight into a swamp.</TE>
<TE>   Capozzola insists the grandparents are heroes who should be
rewarded, not punished, for what they did, even if it was illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement authorities disagree. At the same time, they have
made it clear that the Lopezes are not likely to face long prison
terms for their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   State officials in Florida have charged the Lopezes with
interference with custody, a crime that carries a maximum three-year
sentence. "The likelihood is that they'd be facing less than that,"
said Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the state's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The Lopezes also face federal charges of interstate flight to
avoid prosecution. But an FBI spokeswoman said the agency usually
drops such charges once fugitives are in custody facing state
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Capozzola said he wants to negotiate a deal for the grandparents
that would spare them prison time.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Jr. said he doesn't want to see his parents behind bars, but
does want to see them admit they were wrong, "so we can be a family
again."</TE>
<TE>   He desperately wants to see his daughter, although he knows she
doesn't want to see him. He is willing to wait until she is ready, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   So is Coleman. It will take time, she knows, for Kaylee to come to
terms with what has happened. "I've learned to be very patient," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the Shadows</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee's story is a surprisingly common one.</TE>
<TE>   "There are thousands of these families who are either coming out
or right at the stage of coming out," said Alan Rosenfeld, a Colorado
attorney who has represented parents in the underground.</TE>
<TE>   A support group, Take Root, has been established by a woman in
Portland, Ore., who was abducted three times in her adolescence --
once by her father, twice by her mother. Liss Hart-Haviv, 34, said
people who were abducted by family members tend to have problems with
identity and loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   "We spend our lives trying to grow up and put it behind us, which
you can't really do," she said. "You can't just sweep it under the
rug."</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee Lopez said her life was fine until she turned 18 and
realized that in order to live a normal life, she would have to step
out of the shadows, despite the risk to her grandparents. She has
been taking college classes and preparing for a high school
equivalency exam. It was her desire to apply to colleges that led her
to want to reclaim her legal identity; admission officers, she
feared, would see through her alias.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up like a normal kid," she said. "I went to school, I had
my friends, I had my home, you know, I had my room. I grew up with a
normal life, and now everything's going insane. I can't have a normal
life anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, she said she is not angry at her parents. "I'm hurt,
I'm upset, I'm maybe a little miffed," she said. "I should be trying
to kill someone. But I don't want to. I just want to get on with my
life."</TE>
<TE>   Through Capozzola's efforts, she has been removed from state and
national missing children lists. She plans soon to move out of her
grandparents' house, a change she views with trepidation. She has
asked Capozzola to help her legally change her name to Rosa Aurora
Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa, she said, is an old family name. Aurora is her grandmother's
given name, later Anglicized to Irene.</TE>
<TE>   Aurora is also the Roman goddess of dawn, who dragged light across
the sky in her chariot. It seems a fitting inspiration for a young
woman, long in the shadows, who is struggling to bring light to her
own new day.</TE>

<TE>   A child's odyssey</TE>
<TE>   Kaylee Lopez's grandparents abducted her when she was 5 and moved
across the country, using assumed names and forged documents to elude
capture. Here is a look at the first phase of their flight, pieced

<HD>Top Universities Shoot the Moon in Pursuit of New Stars</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Universities, like ball clubs and Hollywood studios, have always
competed for the big names. Leah Price isn't one of them.</LD>
<LD>   But Price, a 32-year-old scholar of Victorian literature, finds
herself nonetheless at the heart of a cross-country tug-of-war
between two of America's most prominent universities: UCLA and
Harvard.</LD>
<LD>   Price, whose scholarship includes examinations of love and sex in
Victorian fiction and a look at the role played by -- gasp --
abridgements in the rise of the novel, won't say which way she's
leaning in the (mostly) gentlemanly battle for her services.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, at a time when faculty recruiting wars are more often fought
over distinguished scientists or prominent minority professors, the
eager pursuit of Price provides a window into the intensifying
competition in academia for other sorts of top scholars, including
women and young humanities stars.</TE>
<TE>   It also reflects a new push at Harvard, led by President Lawrence
H. Summers, to hang onto more of the university's most gifted junior
faculty members by offering them tenured positions earlier than
tradition has allowed, officials there said.</TE>
<TE>   And it spotlights the growing reputation of the UCLA English
department for savvy, aggressive recruiting as the school tries to
sell itself as a cutting-edge alternative to the Ivy League.</TE>
<TE>   Price, whose research and teaching topics range from the history
of the novel to detective fiction and even journalism, has taught for
just two years at Harvard, where she earned her undergraduate
literature degree summa cum laude.</TE>
<TE>   She received her doctorate from Yale in 1998, then spent three
years doing research at Cambridge University.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this fall, in a move precipitated in part by UCLA's interest,
the Harvard English department offered to make her a full tenured
professor, years ahead of the typical timetable. If she accepts,
Price will become the first woman to rise to tenure through the
college's English department without a stop at another university.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been so tremendously impressed with her intellectual
firepower and her work in teaching that we took the leap, with full
consciousness of how unusual it was," said the chairman of Harvard's
English department, Lawrence Buell.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has yet to extend its own formal tenure offer, but officials
say they are talking with Price. She has interviewed with department
leaders and visited the campus as part of the university's effort to
woo her to the West Coast. She is spending the year on a fellowship
and book leave at Stanford University's humanities center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not in any hurry," said Thomas Wortham, chairman of UCLA's
English department. "Leah has to decide what's going to make her
happy. She's a very fortunate young woman."</TE>
<TE>   If UCLA loses, Wortham said, he would have this satisfaction: "If
our having identified a very exciting young scholar finally made
Harvard come up into the mid-20th century in its hiring practices,
we're delighted."</TE>
<TE>   Reached by e-mail, Price declined to comment, saying she does not
wish to "complicate negotiations that are still ongoing." She said
she would decide soon.</TE>
<TE>   Neither side would discuss salary details or other possible
inducements, such as offices, research assistants and grants. In the
University of California system, tenured or tenure-track professors
earn an average of $93,000. Harvard, a private institution, doesn't
divulge its salaries. Wortham said the UCLA department identified the
young prospect through a search for an expert on 19th century British
literature and was immediately struck by the quality of her
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "She's doing very innovative work in a well-established field, and
she's demonstrating that at a very early stage in her career," said
Wortham, who also edits a leading scholarly journal on 19th century
literature.</TE>
<TE>   Across the country, Buell said the Harvard English department had
been encouraged to act by Summers' push for the university to make
more tenure offers to younger scholars. Summers, an economist and
Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, won tenure himself
from Harvard at the age of 28. He became president of Harvard in July
2001.</TE>
<TE>   But the main impetus, Buell said, was Price's innovative, even
quirky, scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   A specialist in 18th and 19th century British fiction who lists
herself as at least competent in Dutch, French, Spanish, Italian and
Latin, Price has published widely. Her first book, "The Anthology and
Rise of the Novel" (Cambridge University Press, 2000), examined
literary anthologies and shortened forms that other scholars have
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Reviewers praised Price's insights into, among other things, the
less-than-thorough way that everyone reads, at least occasionally.
Skimming, Price notes in the book, is much like abridging, while
skipping is like anthologizing. This observation, one reviewer noted,
is "delightfully scandalous," especially in an academic context.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few people, and even fewer academics, ever publicly admit to
being bored by long novels, to skimming them, or to skipping to
passages which seem more interesting," reviewer Claudia Johnson wrote
in the London Review of Books.</TE>
<TE>   In her short career at Harvard, Price has taught courses on
Victorian literature and technology and the 18th century novel.</TE>
<TE>   She also conducted an honors seminar, "Sexing Victorian Fiction,"
that examined the central role of love and sex in novels of the
period, as well as the role the novel itself has played in forming
society's thinking about gender.</TE>
<TE>   With readings from Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins
and others, the course covered such issues as "sex and money, reading
and shopping, work and marriage ... unsexed women and unmanned men,
feminism and anti-feminism," according to the course description.
Needless to say, it was popular, Harvard professors said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the schools trying to woo her, Price's work is
particularly unusual in light of her youth. Humanities professors
typically don't reach their creative peaks until their late 40s or
early 50s, several academics said, unlike scientists and
mathematicians, who often do so 10 to 20 years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons for the difference are complex, several said, but they
identified a factor: The humanities are interpretative disciplines in
which scholars examine works of art through the prism of their own
experience, returning again and again to a book, for instance, with
new insights each time.</TE>
<TE>   "That whole process is less linear than the quantitative fields,
and filled with gaps and haphazardness," Harvard's Buell said. "To
have such a mature critical thinker come on the scene so early and
make a splash is just so unusual in the humanities. You don't want to
lose such a person if you can possibly avoid it."</TE>
<TE>   Price also has been helped because Harvard, UCLA and many other
premier universities are searching for top scholars who are also
women.</TE>
<TE>   Although female students are now a 56% majority at U.S. colleges,
a gender imbalance persists in the faculties, especially in the upper
reaches, according to John Curtis, research director at the American
Assn. of University Professors. Women represent fewer than one in
five of the tenured faculty members at the nation's four-year public
and private universities.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is certainly a factor in hiring, said Wortham, whose
UCLA department has 38 men, all but one with tenure, and 20 women, 18
of whom are tenured. "To hire a woman at the senior level these days
is a pretty arduous task, so you look at the younger ones. And
they're out there, like this one, and they're good."</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA department is trying to sell itself against its Ivy
League rival, which usually is first or tied for first in national
rankings of English departments. UCLA places in the top dozen.</TE>
<TE>   To close that gap, UCLA's English department paints itself as more
dynamic, diverse and contemporary than Harvard's.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also has excellent rare book collections, great cultural
facilities like the Getty nearby and, he said, "much, much better
weather."</TE>

<HD>Bush, Social Conservatives Testing Each Other's Muscle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds and James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Less than two weeks after the remarkable GOP victory in
the congressional elections, President Bush and the hard-core
conservatives who make up an important part of his support are
already butting heads.</LD>
<LD>   During the lame-duck session of Congress that opened last week,
Bush focused on two issues that appeal to Republican centrists:
national security and the economy.</LD>
<LD>   But these do not energize the party's rock-ribbed conservatives.
Abortion and school prayer are the social right's kinds of issues.
Then there is the dwindling number of moderate Republicans whose
votes will be crucial and can't be taken for granted.</LD>
<TE>   The lame-duck session suggests that tensions within the Republican
coalition will pose risks for the president even after the GOP
assumes narrow control of both the House and the Senate next year.</TE>
<TE>   Bush "is going to have to work with conservative Republicans,"
said K.B. Forbes, a Republican strategist and former aide to
presidential candidates Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes. "They're
pivotal. Conservatives are on cloud nine."</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, the strategist Forbes acknowledged, Bush has
to "build the broad message" that will attract centrists and
independents.</TE>
<TE>   Some issues allow the president to appeal to many parts of the
Republican spectrum at once. His proposal last week to subject as
many as 850,000 government jobs below policymaking levels to
competition from private contractors appealed to a broad range of
Republicans for its claim of more efficient government service and
its potential to undercut federal employee unions.</TE>
<TE>   But as often as not, Bush has to choose between the various wings
of his party. The terrorism insurance bill last week was one such
occasion.</TE>
<TE>   For economic reasons, Bush supports providing backup government
insurance for damage caused by terrorism. He argues that it will
jump-start construction projects delayed by a lack of insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives, however, worry that the legislation could
inspire a host of frivolous lawsuits and enrich the nation's trial
lawyers, a group high on conservatives' enemies list.</TE>
<TE>   Some conservatives in the House, led by Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas), threatened to block the bill. Bush intervened and twisted
arms, and the House passed the bill Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson, observers say, is that the president can roll over the
conservatives when he wants to.</TE>
<TE>   Bush can "to a certain extent ignore the right," said a senior GOP
Senate aide, who spoke on condition on anonymity. "He's the king of
the Republican Party. Unlike his father, he has hardly any
vulnerability to his right, which gives him maximum flexibility to
move to the center."</TE>
<TE>   But the same day provided a counterexample: the bankruptcy reform
bill. Bush and pro-business Republicans favored the bill, designed to
limit the growing number of personal bankruptcies, but social
conservatives opposed an amendment that prevented antiabortion
activists from declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying fines for
blocking access to abortion clinics. After months of negotiation,
House conferees hammered out a compromise that would prohibit anyone
blocking legitimate businesses from using the bankruptcy law to avoid
fines.</TE>
<TE>   But when the bill came to a vote Thursday, a handful of
Republicans still opposed it and helped block it from being
considered.</TE>
<TE>   Then, about 2 in the morning on Friday, Republican House leaders
revived the bill, passing it without the amendment.</TE>
<TE>   That left the bill in a form that the Senate, still in Democratic
hands during the lame-duck session, would not pass. So the measure,
which has accounted for considerable time and effort from Congress,
will die when the lame-duck session concludes this week.</TE>
<TE>   The lesson from the bankruptcy bill is that the president ignores
conservatives at his peril.</TE>
<TE>   "What they did was send a message that, 'We want to help you with
your agenda, but don't run over us roughshod,' " said David Keene,
chairman of the American Conservative Union.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shot across the bow of the White House," agreed Ross K.
Baker, a political scientist and expert on Congress. "They really
have to be careful that conservatives in the House aren't so
emboldened by the results of the election that they seriously
overreach."</TE>
<TE>   Bush bristles at the suggestion that he has a balancing act on his
hands. "I don't take cues from anybody," he said in a news conference
last week. "I just do what I think is right. That's just the way I
lead."</TE>
<TE>   But as Bush and his team look ahead to his 2004 reelection race,
they are all too aware that divisions with social conservatives
helped sink his father's reelection bid in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Bush is thought likely to try to follow the model of
another recent Republican president. Ronald Reagan publicly endorsed
the conservatives' social agenda but did little to implement it,
instead focusing on tax cuts and other economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an approach that was successful for Reagan," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives say they will not try to do what they did in 1994,
the last time they seized power in both houses of Congress. Then they
tried to push a broad agenda of issues, including abortion, school
prayer and union-busting.</TE>
<TE>   Keene says Republicans were unfamiliar with being in the majority
and wanted to strike quickly before they lost that status. Now, he
said, they seem to be cementing their majority status among the
electorate and so are less impatient.</TE>
<TE>   And there's another big difference between 1994 and 2002, he said.
In 1994, Democrat Bill Clinton was president. Now Bush is, and
conservatives are convinced that he's on their side.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of his attention is going to be on national security and the
economy," Keene said. "But I don't think the president is going to
slight the social right, because of his own personal views. I very
much doubt he is going to leave that part of his constituency out in
the cold."</TE>
<TE>   But there are a number of issues on the horizon where the business
and social wings of the Republican Party could find themselves at
odds, including immigration and the curtailment of civil liberties as
a result of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Business Republicans worry that the social conservatives' agenda
could endanger centrist support for the issues nearest their hearts,
like tax cuts. Jonathan Collegio of Americans for Tax Reform says
that to maintain party unity, the social conservatives would be wise
to focus first on the parts of their agenda that appeal to the
center, such as outlawing late-term abortion and human cloning.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 1995, people in the conservative movement have grown up,
and they know you can't get everything you want all at once," he
said. And the message the White House is sending them is: "As long as
you're patient, don't get ahead of yourself and set reasonable goals
and reasonable time limits, you can pass a lot of what you want."</TE>

<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</DL>
<LD>In a case that became a national symbol of a flawed justice system, a
man who was exonerated after spending seven years on death row for
the rape and murder of a little girl has asked for a formal pardon.</LD>
<LD>   The girl's family is objecting, however, saying they believe he
was involved in the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Rolando Cruz was twice convicted of abducting, raping and killing
Jeanine Nicarico, 10. At a third trial he was acquitted after a
police officer changed his story about an incriminating statement
Cruz supposedly made. DNA evidence later pointed to someone else as
the rapist.</LD>
<TE>   Cruz was freed after spending 11 years in prison -- seven of them
on death row. On Friday, he formally asked the Prisoner Review Board
to clear his name, a step that would let him seek about $100,000 in
compensation from the state of Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   "He is innocent. That's what we're here about," Cruz's attorney,
Lawrence Marshall of Northwestern University, told the board. "He's
been tormented."</TE>
<TE>   But some prosecutors and the family of Jeanine, who was abducted
from her Naperville home in 1983, still believe Cruz had something to
do with the child's death.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the evidence we have seen and heard, we are convinced
beyond any doubt that Rolando Cruz was involved in our little girl's
kidnapping and murder," said Pat Nicarico, Jeanine's mother. "What a
disgrace," she told the board. "This is a miscarriage of justice."</TE>
<TE>   The case put Illinois' death penalty system in the national
spotlight. Cruz is one of 13 people sent to death row but later found
to have been wrongly convicted. That led Gov. George Ryan to halt
executions in Illinois nearly three years ago and to propose an
overhaul of the death penalty system.</TE>
<TE>   The Cruz case even became an issue in the races for governor and
attorney general because the Republican nominees -- Jim Ryan and Joe
Birkett -- helped prosecute him. Neither candidate would discuss the
case in detail, simply saying they accepted the court's finding.</TE>
<TE>   In documents filed with the board, Birkett, the DuPage County
state's attorney, said DNA tests show that Brian Dugan raped Jeanine.</TE>
<TE>   Dugan, 46, has confessed to the crime and has said he committed it
alone. Dugan has never been charged in the death but is serving a
life term for unrelated murders.</TE>

<HD>Pay Is Up for More College Presidents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A survey has found that the number of presidents of top private
colleges and universities who are paid more than $500,000 annually in
wages and benefits more than doubled last year.</LD>
<LD>   The Chronicle of Higher Education survey, to be published Monday,
found 27 private college presidents earned more than $500,000 in
2001, up from 12 in that compensation bracket the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Eighty-five presidents earned between $300,000 and $500,000, the
survey reported.</LD>
<TE>   The median compensation secured last year by leaders of doctoral
universities was $356,092. Presidents at schools offering master's
programs had a median salary of $173,547. At liberal arts colleges,
the median salary was $205,323.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Rodin, president of the University of Pennsylvania, topped
the list with pay and benefits equaling $808,021. Former Princeton
University President Harold T. Shapiro, with an annual compensation
of $705,683, was next, followed by Johns Hopkins University President
William R. Brody, at $677,564.</TE>
<TE>   The Chronicle arrived at the figures by analyzing federal tax
forms filed by 595 private colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Martin, a senior vice president with executive search
corporation Witt/Kiefer, said the salaries are well-earned.</TE>
<TE>   College presidents must balance the interests of many groups on
their campuses while simultaneously raising money and running what is
essentially a business, said Martin, who matches colleges and
universities with presidential job applicants.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the presidents we know are on call seven days a week
starting at 7 in the morning and ending at 10 at night. You're always
on. So, if you look at the size of the salary, it is relatively
small," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The president of the Council of Independent Colleges, Richard
Ekman, agreed that the salary level is justified.</TE>
<TE>   Representing schools that have enrollments of up to 2,000
students, Ekman said the compensation paid out by the wealthier
colleges in the council ranges between $250,000 and $300,000.</TE>

<HD>Commuter Tax Proposal Sets Off a War of Words</HD>
<DH>Out-of-towners scoff at N.Y. Mayor Bloomberg's idea to
close budget gap with levy on their income. But the plan has support
in the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"Who likes taxes?" asked the man behind the Pretzel Bakery stand at
Grand Central Station as the commuters rushed by, headed for trains
home to the suburbs. "But I live here in New York. So do you want the
altruistic answer or the selfish answer?"</LD>
<LD>   Then the peddler laughed, making clear that he supported the
"commuter tax" proposed last week by New York Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg, who wants to take a bite out of the wages of those who
work in the city but live outside it.</LD>
<LD>   "Just don't tell these people," whispered the pretzel man as he
took his own small piece of the suburbanites' income before they fled
Friday evening, many fuming over the tax proposal that quickly
divided city dwellers and out-of-towners, prompting rhetoric that at
times seemed worthy of a professional wrestling arena.</LD>
<TE>   "Highway Robbery" headlined the New York Post, doing its part to
raise the blood pressure of the commuters.</TE>
<TE>   From the other side came a Newsday commentator, asking, "Remind me
again: Why shouldn't the freeloading suburbanites pay? They roar into
our city five mornings a week, clogging our sidewalks with their
rotund posteriors, grinding our traffic to a halt, filling our trash
cans with their fast-food containers, hogging the seats on our buses
and trains. Then at the earliest hint of trouble, you know what these
broad-lawn people do: They punch 911 into their cell phones and
summon our firefighters, paramedics and cops. And all day long, they
behave as if they have a God-given right to the high-priced largess
-- for free."</TE>
<TE>   What set them off was Bloomberg's announcement Thursday that one
solution to the city's projected multibillion-dollar budget shortfall
might be a 2.7% tax on the incomes of suburban commuters, a rate more
than six times higher than a similar tax repealed three years ago in
flusher economic times.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the kind of thing that causes border wars," said
Westchester County Executive Andy Spano, the top elected official in
the county immediately north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that tens of thousands of New York City residents make the
"reverse commute" to his suburban county to work, Spano said, "I
could start taxing them. What would be the point?"</TE>
<TE>   But even as Spano and other suburban leaders vowed to fight such a
tax, as did officials in the neighboring states of New Jersey and
Connecticut, they seemed confident that Bloomberg was largely
posturing, that he did not realistically expect the New York
Legislature to require 800,000 out-of-town workers to pay local taxes
to New York City -- and at the same level as city residents: more
than $2,000 on an income of at least $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   Area officials speculated that Bloomberg was attempting shock
therapy to wrangle budget help from the Legislature in Albany and
Gov. George Pataki, a fellow Republican, or was trying to make a
smaller commuter tax seem palatable, like the 0.45% tax abolished
three years ago after it became a hot issue in a suburban legislative
race.</TE>
<TE>   "This poor guy's back is against the wall," Spano said of
Bloomberg. "But we're all facing a local [budget] crisis."</TE>
<TE>   After the devastation of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, there's
more sympathy for New York's financial problems than there might have
been in past years. More than a few of the commuters passing through
Grand Central Station on Friday night admitted a willingness to give
to the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The city is in bad shape. I'm not tax-adverse," said a magazine
executive rushing to make the train to Bedford, in northern
Westchester.</TE>
<TE>   But for everyone like him, there were several Jennifer Fruccos.
"If they want people to come into the city, it doesn't make sense,"
Frucco said as she boarded another northbound train.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old is a physical therapist at Bellevue Hospital in
Manhattan but will take maternity leave when she has her first child
next spring. She said a commuter tax might prompt her to look for a
new job closer to her Yonkers home after that. "For some people, this
could be the deciding factor," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the aisle on the train, White Plains resident Rupert
Huggins, 41, did the math. An engineer for a computer software
company near Madison Square Garden, the Jamaican immigrant pays $141
each month to be among the 52,000 Westchester residents who use Metro
North trains into Grand Central Station during the morning peak
hours. He then takes a subway to his office, at another $1.50 a ride.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm talking about paying $2,000 a year in transportation," he
said. "Then if you're talking about parking too" -- at the train
station -- "that's up to $3,000. Now they're talking about an extra
$2,000" -- for the commuter tax -- "which means you are paying more
than $5,000 for the privilege of working in New York."</TE>
<TE>   If the tax went through, "I wouldn't change where I work," Huggins
said. "I'd change where I live."</TE>
<TE>   He might look for housing in parts of New York City, such as
Brooklyn or the Bronx, that are more affordable than Manhattan, and
an easy subway ride away -- and where he could vote against any New
York mayor who tried to tax him further.</TE>
<TE>   He said a couple of co-workers who live in New Jersey had a
different plan. "They said, 'You know, Rupert, we're just going to
start working from home.' "</TE>
<TE>   From the seat in front of him, a woman's voice called out. "Don't
worry, the tax is not going to happen. It's not gonna fly," said
Chandra Gaspar, 28, a telecommunications worker.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have to pay anyway," piped in a 21-year-old woman next
to her.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Callahan explained that she is still a student at Fordham
University and an unpaid intern with an advertising agency in
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't tax you if you work for free," she said. "I'm real
lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan said she hoped to work in San Francisco after completing
college.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that," said Gaspar, "is an expensive commute."</TE>

<CX>   New York budget -- A story in Section A on Sunday misstated the
amount by which a proposed New York City commuter tax exceeds a
similar tax that was repealed three years ago. The proposed new tax
of 2.7% on suburban commuters' incomes is five times higher than the
previous rate of 0.45%, not more than six times higher.</CX>

<HD>Ships Arriving at Ports With Extra Cargo: Dead Whales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Over a period of about eight weeks, three ships pulled into Northwest
ports with a fin whale draped over their bulbous underwater bows.</LD>
<LD>   The first dead fin whale -- the mammal is the world's
second-largest creature -- arrived Aug. 9 at the Port of Seattle on
the bow of the container ship Tokyo Express. The second came into
Portland, Ore., on the automobile transport vessel Ruby Ray on Sept.
2. The third reached a Cherry Point, Wash., refinery on the bow of an
oil tanker Oct. 2.</LD>
<LD>   It's happened before, but not in such quick succession.</LD>
<TE>   "To have three come in so close together is something we've not
seen before," said Brent Norberg, marine-mammal coordinator for the
National Marine Fisheries Service here.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear why, though scientists speculate that the whales
may have changed feeding patterns -- moving into traffic lanes in
search of prey. It appears "the food they're grazing on happens to be
on a freeway," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And there may well be more such cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any feel at all for what the frequency is of
animals that get struck at sea and dislodged at sea," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ship-whale collisions and other encounters -- net entanglements
and propeller hits -- have been an increasing factor in whale deaths
off the nation's coasts for some years now, raising concerns among
whale biologists. Ships are bigger and faster while populations of
the now protected whales are increasing.</TE>
<TE>   In the recent cases, tests indicate that two of the whales were
alive when they were hit. Damage to the Portland carcass suggests it
was already dead.</TE>
<TE>   The carcasses, which ranged from 35 feet to 60 feet long,
apparently were tucked up against the vessels by the bulbous bows,
which protrude into the ship's path just under the waterline. The
odd-shaped projections on cargo ships' noses have greatly increased
fuel efficiency through "wave-making resistance reduction technology"
developed in the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a container ship without one," Port of Seattle
spokesman Mick Schultz said.</TE>
<TE>   A bulbous bow would prevent a struck animal from simply rolling
off to the side, Norberg said.</TE>
<TE>   There is no research on whether bulbous-bow technology could be a
factor in whale deaths, Norberg said. The percentage of bulbous-bow
ships involved in collisions with whales is not known.</TE>
<TE>   Ships' crews "are as surprised as anyone when they pull in and the
animal is there," he said. The vessels weigh in at tens of thousands
of tons: "That's a massive object moving through the water," and
striking a whale would be "kind of like hitting a noodle with your
car."</TE>
<TE>   The remains of the two whales that probably were alive when struck
were quite fresh when they reached port, Norberg said, which suggests
the strikes occurred as the vessels neared their journeys' end.</TE>
<TE>   That reduces the chance a whale strike would be noticed, he said.
When ships near port -- after a five-day straight-shot voyage from
Asia, for example -- they are busy taking on pilots to navigate
inland waters, slowing down to enter the Strait of Juan de Fuca and
making routine changes in operational strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Also, "crew size is going down as vessel speed and size are going
up," noted activist Fred Felleman of Ocean Advocates. "And even if
somebody did see a whale, it's not like a big ship can turn on a
dime."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike toothed whales, baleens do not echo-locate -- a method of
detecting objects and food by creating a series of clicks and
interpreting the reflected sound. Even so, scientists believe they
have very sensitive hearing. And today's bigger, faster ships
generate "significant amounts of noise," said whale expert John
Calambokidis of Cascadia Research in Olympia, Wash.</TE>
<TE>   Still, with few natural enemies, whales may not consider an
approaching vessel a threat.</TE>

<HD>A Quiet Prelude to War in Ernie Pyle's Archives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>Editor's Note: This is the first in an occasional series of
columns from across America as it prepares for a possible war in
Iraq.</SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BLOOMINGTON, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Before the United States entered World War II, and before he made his
name as the chronicler of the common soldier, Ernie Pyle spent a
half-dozen years or so roaming the country, batting out folksy
newspaper columns six days a week about what might be called the real
America.</LD>
<LD>   Pyle was the son of a Hoosier farmer, and his columns from this
period are kept at Indiana University's Lilly Library. The collection
seemed to offer a natural set of reference points, a roadmap, for
exploring the country now, some 60 years later, as it contemplates
the prospect of another war.</LD>
<LD>   As these things go, however, nothing is ever quite that simple.</LD>
<TE>   Pyle went everywhere and wrote about almost anything. He wrote
about his encounters with one-handed cowboys, bowling champions and
"lady barbers" on the Alaskan frontier, about the foibles of roadside
mechanics and the nuances of Wisconsin cheese-making. What he didn't
write about all that much, it turns out, was the coming war.</TE>
<TE>   Pyle resisted joining the keyboard generals of the press in what
he called "war blab-blab." His discipline was remarkable. As the
Nazis poured into Poland, Pyle was filing daily dispatches about a
hike through Montana's grizzly bear country. On the week that France
fell, he was introducing his readers to the founder of the Piggly
Wiggly grocery chain.</TE>
<TE>   This is not to say, however, that a reading of Pyle's prewar
ramblings offered little to illuminate. In a subtle way, the
collection reflects the manner in which a country moves toward war --
not in a purposeful march, but in a slow meandering, like a river
rolling easily toward a violent waterfall.</TE>
<TE>   If Pyle avoided the topic of war, it was only in part because of
the nature of his assignment. He found that Americans -- at least the
ones he came across in more remote corners of the country -- weren't
all that interested. Half of them, he observed once in a letter,
didn't seem to know there even was a war on in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Traveling as we do from here to there," he wrote in late 1939,
"we get, I suppose, what the chart-makers would call a cross-section.
And this cross-section is about the most unanimous I've ever observed
on any subject. It shows that in the West, when people speak about
the war, they say mainly, 'Oh to hell with it.' But mainly they don't
speak about it at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Letters from Washington and New York tell us that every gathering
of friends these days practically ends in a fistfight over war
dissensions. But we have recently spent entire evenings with whole
roomfuls of people without the war even being mentioned once."</TE>
<TE>   More than once, Pyle mentioned in passing what he perceived to be
unreal assumptions about what a war would entail. In San Francisco,
he watched small boys play army on a hillside: "The trouble, you see,
is that 25 years is too long between wars. We've got to have wars
oftener, so everybody will remember the last one. Because wars are
fun -- until you've been through one."</TE>
<TE>   Crossing Nebraska, he stopped to describe a scene he'd seen played
out more than once: "We go to some big public celebration, such as a
Fourth of July parade, 5,000 miles from the nearest bomb. The Army
puts a group of two-month draftees in the parade. They march by in
good order and look pretty nice. The flag passes and everybody stands
up. The announcer cracks over the loudspeaker. 'Boy, if old Hitler
could just see this!'</TE>
<TE>   "We all cheer wildly, ripple our muscles, picture Hitler shaking
in his boots, sit back down, nod knowingly to each other, and go back
to eating our beautiful popcorn out of a sack. We're wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   As the possibility of war crept into national consciousness, so
did it creep into Pyle's columns, first on the edges, as marginalia,
subtext: "There is no German building," he observed in one of several
columns from the World's Fair in New York, which occurred after the
Nazis took Czechoslovakia. "There is, however, a Czechoslovakian
building. A building without a country."</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, Pyle described a summer day spent on a beach in Biloxi,
Miss. Dressed, he dutifully reported, in a pair of 49-cent swim
trunks, he talked for hours with a friend about the German invasion
of France. The war, he said, was becoming an all-consuming concern,
and he wrapped up his column with this:</TE>
<TE>   "The birds sing all night down here, and sometimes I waken deep in
the night, and the birds are gay out there in the dark stillness, and
I can picture the lovely magnolia tree in the backyard, and
everything is so hushed and gentle and sweet, and I wonder if ever
again in this world there can be such peace as this."</TE>
<TE>   In time, as the war drums banged more and more loudly, Pyle began
to address the subject head-on -- although not exclusively, for he
was filing copy about spelunkers and crab fishermen right up to the
attack on Pearl Harbor. He went to England and wrote powerfully about
the firebombing of London. In the United States, he visited boot
camps and bomb factories.</TE>
<TE>   On his watch, the country had gone on a war footing, a fact that
intruded upon even his non-war columns. In Toledo, he visited a plant
that made car fenders, only to find it had been converted to crank
out bombshells. In Madison, the cheese-makers he interviewed
complained of running short on supplies -- more and more milk was
being dried in anticipation of war.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wear anything but cotton socks, so I should worry about a
silk shortage," he wrote from Cleveland in the summer of 1941. "Also,
I drive slowly and only about every third day, so I guess I can get
along without much gasoline. And as for the stoppage of installment
buying -- I've never bought so much as a lead pencil on time in my
life.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have to begin cutting out cigarettes and hotel beds
before the war bothers me."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the war would bother him in the ultimate way. "The
long rest is over," he wrote from San Francisco after Pearl Harbor.
"All long rests are over, for everybody." Before too long Ernie Pyle
was in Europe, the diarist of GI Joes. It was a brilliant run that
lasted until April 18, 1945, when the 44-year-old "Hoosier Vagabond"
took a bullet in the head from a Japanese sniper.</TE>

<HD>Derided Computer Plan Clicks With Maine Students</HD>
<DH>Chided for giving all seventh-graders laptops, Gov. Angus
King is now widely praised for raising education levels through
technology.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KITTERY, Maine</DL>
<LD>In strong, direct terms, many Maine residents let Gov. Angus King
know that his plan to provide laptop computers to every
seventh-grader in the state was crazy.</LD>
<LD>   "Dear Governor," read one typical e-mail when King first floated
the proposal almost three years ago: "This is the stupidest idea any
politician ever had. What are you smoking?"</LD>
<LD>   Undeterred by correspondence and legislative outcries that ran 10
to 1 against him, King proceeded with the "study in perseverance"
that became the signature issue of a two-term, independent governor
who reasoned that by using technology to raise education levels,
Maine could build a better work force and thus strengthen its
economy.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, as 18,000 seventh-graders added Apple laptops in neat
black cases to the school supplies they tote home each night, the
missives to King's office took on a new tone.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Governor," wrote the mother of a child whose seizure
disorders kept him from holding a pencil long enough to complete a
spelling test: "I want to thank you for saving my son's life."</TE>
<TE>   As school administrators such as Principal Gregory Goodness of the
Shapleigh Middle School here lauded his state's effort to "level the
academic playing field," the $37-million "learning technology
initiative" made Maine the first state to offer universal laptop
distribution to an entire grade of middle-schoolers. With the flip of
a laptop "on" switch, Goodness and others asserted, students who live
in rusty trailers stood on a tech par with classmates whose seaside
mansions boast broadband connections and troves of software.</TE>
<TE>   The ambitious plan to equalize learning opportunities for
12-year-olds is too new to have withstood standardized testing. But
at a trial run last spring at one school in rural Washington County,
absenteeism dropped 50% with the arrival of state-issued laptops.
Pre-laptops, seventh-graders at Pembroke School received 28
detentions in 96 days. With laptops, the same students numbered just
three detentions in 79 days. Using the laptops, 91% raised their
grades in at least one academic area; 82% improved in two subjects;
73% in three or more fields.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a skeptic at first," said Goodness, whose school board
passed a resolution two years ago opposing the laptop proposal. "But
this really is changing the face of education."</TE>
<TE>   Educators from around the country -- as well as from Scotland,
Canada and France -- have come to Maine to study the novel plan to
boost computer literacy, instituted with foundation help from
Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates. Early this month, a Texas
company announced a software donation valued at $400 million to aid
the pioneering program. Last week, native-son novelist Stephen King
signed on as a volunteer online writing coach.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing I want to remind you about this technology," King, who
is not related to the governor, told the state's seventh-graders. "If
you don't like what I say, you can use the button that says 'delete'
and make it go away."</TE>
<TE>   Poring over her pearl-white laptop, Shapleigh Middle School
seventh-grader Jackie Ransome said she could hardly wait to ask the
legendary horror author for advice about the story she was writing.
In the fashion of many seventh-graders who speak in taut
monosyllables, she barely looked up from her screen as she said: "I'm
psyched."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview last week as he prepares to leave office in
January, Gov. King said he realized a fresh leadership approach was
needed as he suffered through a soporific session at a national
governors' conference three years ago. "Everybody was using the same
formula: regulatory streamlining, tax cuts, investments in research
and development," King said.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this clear insight that we were trapped at being 37th in
per capita income."</TE>
<TE>   That same snowy winter of 1999, Maine woke up to a surprise budget
surplus of more than $50 million. King decided to use the cash to
help vault the state out of poverty by making it a leader in
technology education.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Governor," fumed an e-mail that summarily arrived at his
office: "We are a poor state. Let someone else lead."</TE>
<TE>   "And we will stay a poor state," King responded, "unless we lead."</TE>
<TE>   After a year of haggling, the state Legislature approved a
$30-million endowment that staggers the initial apportionment of
36,000 laptops over two years. Foundation donations paid the
difference for the $37-million contract with Apple Computer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   This year's seventh-graders will use the current batch of machines
again next year, in the eighth grade, while the incoming
seventh-graders will receive new Apples.</TE>
<TE>   An annual outlay of $15 million to $20 million -- out of the
state's $1.8-billion school budget -- could keep the program going
indefinitely, King said. He said that during a 15-hour special
session Wednesday, in which lawmakers grappled with a $240-million
budget shortfall, no one called for eliminating the laptop spending.</TE>
<TE>   King said his office worked closely with Apple to ensure that the
laptops were learning aids, not entertainment devices. Except for
chess -- considered a mental discipline -- no games were installed,
and none can be downloaded, said Jim Doyle, a King aide who oversaw
the project. Students have limited e-mail access and cannot perform
instant messaging. Music and pop culture sites also are restricted.
Pop-up ads do not appear.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, the laptops serve as high-tech tools for writing and
research, with students and parents promising in writing to adhere to
the boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a 12-year-old and I know how attractive these games can
be," King said. "I was not going to be the governor who brought
36,000 Game Boys to Maine."</TE>
<TE>   All 239 middle schools in Maine have been equipped with wireless
networks, but laptop policies vary. Most districts let students use
the laptops at home, after parents complete a short orientation
course.</TE>
<TE>   Students say transporting the computers is the closest thing to a
problem -- not so much because they are cumbersome, but because the
kids sometimes forget to zip their carrying cases. Still, boasted
Shapleigh School seventh-grader John Wright, "I dropped mine three
times and nothing happened." His friend Nick Bartek glanced up to
remark, "It's a shock that they actually trust us with these things."</TE>
<TE>   Chafing at the notion of serving as a laboratory for educational
innovation, some in the state of 1.2 million residents label the
initiative a waste of time and, more importantly, money.</TE>
<TE>   "We're on our backs up here financially, and there are a lot of
people who think this just doesn't make a whole lot of sense," said
Mary Adams, a longtime tax activist from central Maine. "I don't know
how they're going to use these laptops effectively to justify the
expenditure."</TE>
<TE>   But the governor compares the critics to naysayers who rose up
generations ago when schools talked about sending children home with
other learning devices. "They said they could throw them at each
other, or dump them in mud puddles and destroy them," King said.
"They were talking about books."</TE>
<TE>   Preparing to leave office in January and travel with his wife and
two children on a long-promised Winnebago tour of the United States,
King said he will use laptops to home-school his kids along the way.
He also said he would not mind at all if laptops became the
best-known legacy of his eight-year tenure.</TE>
<TE>   "This is beyond anything we expected," he said. "We wrought better
than we thought."</TE>

<HD>Throughout the Country, Latinos See Their Clout Build in
Political Arena</HD>
<DH>Landmark election victories in Georgia and four other
states show candidates finding acceptance among a broad range of
voters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Their roots stretch variously to Mexico, Puerto Rico and Cuba. Two
are Democrats, one is Republican. Yet when Sam Zamarripa, Pedro Marin
and David Casas take office next year, they will share a
history-making distinction in Georgia: They are the first Latinos to
serve in the state's Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   All three won election Nov. 5, representing a breakthrough for
Latinos in the South and capping a vote in which Latino candidates in
Massachusetts, Maryland, Nevada and Oregon also enjoyed their first
triumphs at the state level. The victories reflect the emerging
political effect of Latino voters in states where they are still
comparatively new, but growing fast in number and visibility.</LD>
<LD>   "We're making history," said Marin, a Puerto Rican-born Democrat
who will represent a segment of suburban Gwinnett County in the
Georgia House of Representatives. "The Latino community is growing
rapidly. We were ready to be part of the political process. Our time
to be bystanders was long gone."</LD>
<TE>   The trend is now commonplace in California -- where Latinos make
up one-third of the population and roughly one-fifth of the
120-member Legislature -- as well as in Texas, Florida, New York and
a few other states with sizable Latino voting blocs and accommodating
political boundaries. But the wins in Georgia and elsewhere occurred
in places where Latinos still account for a small minority of
eligible voters.</TE>
<TE>   That means candidates not only had to mobilize a modest Latino
base but also make their case to a broader audience. The success of
candidates in Georgia, where all three winners carried districts in
which Latinos remain a distinct minority, reflects a new phase for
Latinos, who now make up 5% of the state's 8.2 million residents,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an indication that a political infrastructure is being built
in Georgia, which to me indicates a level of acceptance," said Larry
Gonzalez, who directs the Washington, D.C., office of the National
Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the three lawmakers elected in Georgia, two Latinos won
election to Maryland's House of Delegates, becoming the first Latino
lawmakers from Montgomery and Prince George's counties. They will
join Sen. Alexander X. Mooney, who is of Cuban descent, as the only
Latinos in the state's General Assembly. Massachusetts voters elected
former state Rep. Jarrett Barrios as that state's first Latino state
senator.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Nevada and Oregon on Nov. 5 elected Latinos for the
first time to statewide posts. Brian Sandoval will be Nevada's
attorney general, and Oregon state Sen. Susan Castillo becomes the
state's schools superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, there were 13 additional Latino state lawmakers
elected -- an increase from 2000, when there was a gain of six.
Nonetheless, Latinos represent a small share of state legislators
across the county -- just 217 of about 6,500 lawmakers at the state
level. Most of those are in districts where Latinos hold majorities
or represent decisive blocs.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said the recent wins illustrate a growing competitiveness
between Democrats and Republicans in fielding Latino candidates and
seeking to appeal to Latino voters. Sandoval is a Republican, as is
Casas, a teacher elected to the Georgia House. Casas, who is of Cuban
ancestry, represents a newly drawn district, also in Gwinnett County.</TE>
<TE>   "The cause of optimism is at the state legislative level and the
interest by both parties -- the competition," Gonzalez said. "The
numbers in the state House bode very well for the future. It is the
farm team, so to speak, for the congressional races later."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign also served as a proving ground for a new brand of
campaigning in some places. During the primary campaign in Montgomery
County, Democrat Ana Sol Gutierrez found the winning formula by
combining a conventional appeal to habitual voters -- most of them
Anglo -- with a highly focused effort to gain the votes of the 2,095
Latinos who were registered Democrats in her legislative district.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody told me, 'Don't waste your time -- they don't vote,' "
said Gutierrez, a Salvadoran-born systems engineer and former school
board member.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't listen. Instead, as Gutierrez sent off mailers in
English to the well-to-do pockets in Bethesda and Chevy Chase, she
zeroed in on immigrant-heavy areas such as Wheaton and Silver Spring,
with Spanish-language fliers and Spanish-speakers working the phone
banks.</TE>
<TE>   The two-pronged effort worked. In a crowded field of seven
candidates for the Democratic primary, she made the top three --
enough to qualify for the general election and certain victory in a
Democratic district choosing three delegates. Gutierrez, 60,
attributed her winning margin in the primary -- just 250 votes -- to
her success in teaching Latino voters about "bullet voting,"
selecting just one candidate, even though they were allowed to choose
three. But it wouldn't have been enough. "There was no way ... I
could win with the Latino vote. I had to get a margin," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even in places where Latinos haven't traditionally settled, Latino
candidates may find ready acceptance among whites and blacks who are
divided by race -- as long as the Latino community remains small
enough not to be seen as a threat, said Rodolfo de la Garza, a
political science professor at Columbia University in New York.</TE>
<TE>   That can change, though. A recent survey of some Tennessee
residents found a growing feeling that Latino immigrants were making
life worse. The poll, by Middle Tennessee State University, found
that 41% of respondents held an unfavorable view of Latino residents
-- an increase from 28% in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Election results notwithstanding, public sentiment toward Latinos
may be more fully revealed around sensitive policy issues such as
whether to allow undocumented immigrants to acquire driver's
licenses, a proposal that enjoyed a brief life in the Georgia
Legislature last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that the tolerance issue has had its litmus test
yet," said Zamarripa, 50, a Democrat who was unopposed for the state
Senate after winning a primary runoff for the black-majority district
in downtown Atlanta. He defeated Brenda Muhammad, a black school
member.</TE>
<TE>   But Zamarripa, a former Chamber of Commerce official with
long-standing ties to the city's black political establishment, said
his agenda would continue to reflect the needs of the larger
district, an economically varied landscape of gentrifying enclaves,
corporate headquarters and world-weary slums. Health care and poverty
are among the top issues across racial and ethnic lines, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marin agreed. "My second agenda will be the Latino agenda," he
said. Marin, 44, who is executive director of the Mexican Center of
Atlanta, said mutual concerns and simple mathematics -- his newly
created district is less than a third Latino -- demand that he hew to
the interests of no single group.</TE>
<TE>   "If I would have run as a Latino, I wouldn't be making history,"
Marin said. "We have a long way to go, but we're starting. We're
opening the door."</TE>

<CX>   Kennedy car -- A brief that ran in Section A on Nov. 17 incorrectly
stated that the Lincoln Continental that President Kennedy was riding
in when he was assassinated in Dallas in 1963 had been sold at an
auction. The limousine is in the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.
The car sold at the auction was one Kennedy had ridden in earlier in
the day.</CX>

<LD>Eight sharks have died in one month in a tank at the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp;
PPG Aquarium.</LD>
<LD>   Six bonnethead sharks and two black-tip reef sharks died between
Sept. 30 and Oct. 31. Two sharks were killed by another shark and two
died of bacterial infections they might have acquired before they
were brought to the aquarium. Tests on the others are being
conducted, but officials believe deworming medication might be the
culprit.</LD>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM HUNTSVILLE, TEXAS</KH>
<HD>A New Museum Shows Death Penalty as a Way of Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lianne Hart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>The sun was shining here in the nation's death penalty capital when
the mayor cut a ceremonial swath of red ribbon. The correctional
officer choir sang "God Bless America," and tourists sampled a cake
decorated with a black ball and chain.</LD>
<LD>   It was opening day at the Texas Prison Museum, 6,000 square feet
of shackles, knives and guns culled from the town's sprawling state
prison complex, which houses the busiest execution chamber in the
country.</LD>
<LD>   "It's really not macabre," Huntsville Mayor William Green said.
"It shows the history of an institution that has been part of this
community for 150 years."</LD>
<TE>   Inside the red-brick walls designed to resemble a prison, young
mothers peered at murder weapons and tattoo guns while bored toddlers
in strollers sucked their thumbs. Wardens and prison guards glanced
at the memorabilia with casual interest. For them, the jagged kitchen
knife used to kill a guard in 1985 and prisoner-made garrotes hardly
qualified as creepy artifacts. They were scenes from a normal
workweek.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people say, 'How can you show this?' But we don't think it
should be hidden," said Mark Bull, a former lieutenant on death row
who is now a museum board member. "We're not here to blame or excuse
or throw a poor light on Huntsville. We're just here to show what is
and what was. Let people make their own decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Last week's opening marked the move from the 13-year-old gallery's
cramped quarters downtown to a cavernous exhibition hall on the edge
of town. The nonprofit museum is supported by private donations, $4
admission fees and gift shop sales. ("I did hard time in Huntsville,"
announces a $20 souvenir T-shirt.) Eighty miles north of Houston, the
museum is expected to attract more than 50,000 visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibits chronicle inmate life, from crafts to gang warfare.
One installation details famous breakouts at the prison complex and
shows a startlingly realistic gun carved from wood and painted
silver. A replica cell -- complete with bunk beds, a sink and a
toilet -- gives visitors a sense of the quarters inmates share.</TE>
<TE>   But the real draw is the capital punishment display. Death by
lethal injection is graphically illustrated with three syringes used
in the 1982 execution of Texas inmate Charlie Brooks Jr., the first
to die by lethal injection after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated
the death penalty in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "This is gross. Why would anyone keep all this stuff?" asked Lian
Martinez, 32, as she stared at an intravenous tube that snaked
through the Brooks memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of weird that anyone would make a museum like this,"
said Martinez, who grew up in Huntsville, the daughter of a prison
captain. But she understands the allure. "It's kind of like driving
by a car wreck. You can't help but look."</TE>
<TE>   Did convicted murderer J.W. Morrow Jr. ever imagine that his
elaborately detailed last-meal request would one day be on public
display? "One small steak (tender, no bone, no fat, cooked
rare-medium)," instructed Morrow in 1950. He also wanted French fries
(large order), butter beans (small order) and brown grease gravy
(medium order).</TE>
<TE>   "This is my last meal, and ... I want it served hot on however
many plates it takes to keep from mixing everything up together," he
wrote in a determined scrawl.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow was 29 when he was strapped into "Old Sparky," Texas'
famous electric chair also on display here, its burnished wood and
thick leather straps gleaming like a piece of art under a row of
track lighting. The chair was retired in 1964 after 361 executions,
and when inmates helped set up the new museum, most were reluctant to
handle it. "No one wanted to touch it," Bull said.</TE>
<TE>   Donna White, 36, a tourist from Ohio, shook her head as she looked
at the forbidding chair and syringes. "It's eerie," she said. "But I
think everybody needs to come here to see what capital punishment is
really about."</TE>
<TE>   At the "prison contraband" corner, an 8-year-old boy tugged at his
grandmother's sleeve. "Ninny, what are those?" he asked, pointing to
a row of sharp metal objects. "Those are shanks, honey," she replied.
"See how they hid them in their shoes so they could pop them out and
stab someone?"</TE>
<TE>   "And next to it, that's a homemade nunchuk that prisoners aren't
supposed to have," she added.</TE>
<TE>   "You mean like the ninjas use?" he asked, quickly distracted. "Oh
Ninny, can we go see 'Old Sparky' again?"</TE>
<TE>   Texas has performed 29 executions this year; most were carried out
without any public stir. Three are scheduled in Huntsville this week,
and they too will probably cause barely a ripple here, Bull said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't pay attention to it. It's quiet and lovely
here, and life goes on," he said. "We don't impose the death penalty.
We simply carry out a court order."</TE>
<TE>   The town's unapologetic support for its leading employer catches
many visitors off guard, said Martinez, who works for the Chamber of
Commerce. "People come here from Europe and are appalled. We just
say, 'Welcome to Huntsville.' "</TE>

<HD>Robot Arm 'Bruise' Delays Shuttle Launch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Monday's scheduled launch of the space shuttle Endeavour has been
delayed for at least several days and possibly more than a month
because of an accident caused by a distracted launch-pad worker, the
space agency said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Space agency officials said the Endeavour would now launch no
earlier than Friday. It is to deliver a new crew and a 45-foot
segment to the International Space Station.</LD>
<LD>   The shuttle had initially been ready to launch early last Monday,
and its astronauts were being strapped into their seats when an
oxygen leak halted the countdown about three hours before liftoff.</LD>
<TE>   During repairs to the system that delivers air to the crew cabin,
technicians had to open the shuttle's massive payload bay doors, and
a mobile platform holding the repair crew collided with the shuttle's
robot arm, giving it a "bruise."</TE>
<TE>   NASA fixed the blame on a technician, known as a spotter, who was
supposed to prevent such collisions but was looking away at the
critical moment.</TE>
<TE>   "This particular person got distracted. It was a mistake. He was
trying to relocate himself or reposition himself," Ron Dittemore,
NASA's top shuttle manager, told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Although the robot arm can hoist multi-ton payloads in the
weightlessness of space, on Earth it is extremely delicate, unable to
lift even its own weight. The collision was minor, but mission
managers detected some damage.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a bruise, and we don't know its significance," Dittemore
said.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is studying options that could include replacing the
arm while the shuttle is still on the launch pad -- something never
attempted -- or simply not using the arm on this mission. That would
require using a larger, more complex robot arm on the space station,
known as the Big Arm, to do all the work.</TE>
<TE>   But if the shuttle has to be rolled back to its hangar so the arm
can be replaced with one of three remaining robot arms, that could
delay Endeavour's mission into January.</TE>
<TE>   Dittemore said no cost estimates had been worked out for the
various options.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to delivering a new three-man, long-duration crew to
the space station, Endeavour was to return the two Russians and an
American now living on the orbiting laboratory more than four months.</TE>
<TE>   NASA said they have plenty of food, water and life support to last
if the mission should extend into January.</TE>

<HD>Connecticut High School Student Scoops Media on Skakel
Interview</HD>
<DH>Girl had written to killer for a journalism class
assignment. He responds, saying he's innocent and that he misses his
3-year-old son.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEWTOWN, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A high school student has scooped the reporters trying to get prison
interviews with Michael Skakel.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, Samantha Ueckerman received a four-page,
handwritten letter from Skakel, a nephew of the late Robert F.
Kennedy who in August was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison for
the 1975 beating death of Martha Moxley.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, 42, proclaims his innocence in the letter and talks about
the anguish of being separated from his son, George, 3.</LD>
<TE>   "I honestly believe he thinks he did not do it," Ueckerman, 16,
told The Hartford Courant. "He feels he's not guilty and he's been
falsely accused and he's there for no reason."</TE>
<TE>   Ueckerman, a student at Newtown High School, wrote Skakel in hopes
of fulfilling a journalism class assignment to interview someone and
write a story. Her teacher, Nicole Rossi, mentioned that a student
the year before had interviewed inmates at the Garner Correctional
Institution, and noted that Skakel was the prison's most recent
high-profile inmate.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, whose aunt, Ethel, was married to Robert Kenney, was
convicted in June of beating Moxley to death with a golf club in
Greenwich when they were 15-year-old neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials told Ueckerman that even if Skakel agreed to a
face-to-face interview, it would take about four months to get on his
visitor list. So she wrote a letter instead, inquiring about his son,
his religion and life in prison, not about the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to be controversial," Ueckerman said. "If he got
mad, I wouldn't get a response."</TE>
<TE>   Skakel's letter was "really confusing," Ueckerman said. "He's a
very intelligent person in what he writes, but it was scattered. It
seemed like he had so much on his mind he couldn't write it all down
fast enough."</TE>
<TE>   Ueckerman assured Skakel she would not release the letter in its
entirety, but quoted from it for her story.</TE>
<TE>   "I am devastated at the loss of physical contact and minimal phone
contact with my dear sweet son Georgie," Skakel wrote. "I love my son
Georgie more than life itself. He suffers daily from our absence.
When he suffers, I suffer!"</TE>
<TE>   Ueckerman received a second letter from Skakel on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "He mentions again that he does not talk to the press at all," she
said. "But since I'm as young as I am, I have more integrity than
people who've been in journalism longer."</TE>

<LD>Nearing the end of a tumultuous season, the Florida State Seminoles
know that they've at least won a share of the ACC title.</LD>
<LD>   Adrian McPherson threw four touchdown passes in the 15th-ranked
Seminoles' 40-14 victory over North Carolina on Saturday at
Tallahassee, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Making only his third start and first at home, McPherson threw
three scoring passes to Anquan Boldin -- two in the second quarter as
Florida State took a 17-0 halftime lead.</LD>
<TE>   The Seminoles, 8-3 overall, 7-0 in the conference, can earn a bowl
championship series berth and win their 10th conference title in 11
seasons with a victory next Saturday at North Carolina State or if
Maryland loses either of its final two conference games.</TE>
<TE>   After Florida State lost three of four games midway through the
season, McPherson replaced Chris Rix at quarterback, and the
Seminoles are 3-0 since the change.</TE>
<TE>   With tailbacks Greg Jones and Nick Maddox out with injuries,
Florida State relied on its passing game against North Carolina (2-9,
0-7).</TE>
<TE>   McPherson completed five of nine passes for 112 yards in the
second quarter, teaming with Boldin on touchdown plays of 43 and 19
yards. McPherson completed 15 of 30 passes for 237 yards.</TE>
<TE>   No. 19 Maryland 30, Clemson 12 -- Scott McBrien threw three
touchdown passes and ran for another to help the Terrapins win at
Clemson, S.C., for their eighth consecutive victory. Chris Downs led
Maryland (9-2, 5-1) in rushing with 101 yards in 20 carries. The
Terrapins held Clemson to 211 yards of offense and four Aaron Hunt
field goals in four trips inside the Maryland 20. It was the first
time the Tigers (6-5, 4-4) failed to score a touchdown since losing,
38-3, last year to North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia 14, No. 22 North Carolina State 9 -- Matt Schaub threw
two touchdown passes and the Cavalier secondary batted away a pass in
the end zone in the final minute as Virginia (7-4, 5-2) won at
Charlottesville, Va., to hand North Carolina State (9-3, 4-3) its
third loss in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech 17, Duke 2 -- Gordon Clinkscale ran for two
touchdowns and A.J. Suggs completed 18 of 28 passes for 200 yards to
help Georgia Tech (7-4, 4-4) win at Atlanta to extend Duke's
ACC-record losing streak to 24. Duke is 2-9, 0-7.</TE>

Clippers should be favored to win. Will they? There's not much to
like on the Nugget roster, and less to fear for visiting teams at the
Pepsi Center.</LD>

<LD>When the Clippers are bad, they are very bad. When they are messy,
they are very messy. Nothing this season has been as unsightly as the
Clippers' inability to maintain control of the basketball.</LD>
<LD>   "We gave up 35 points off our turnovers," Coach Alvin Gentry said,
referring to the team's 22 turnovers, which led to 35 points for
Portland during the Trail Blazers' 112-88 romp Friday over the
Clippers at the Rose Garden.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no way we can turn the ball over that much and give up 35
points and still expect to win. We talk about it all the time, but we
aren't getting better at it. We haven't played good basketball the
last two games."</LD>
<TE>   In addition to Friday's defeat at Portland, the Clippers committed
19 turnovers Thursday during a 101-80 loss to the Orlando Magic at
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers maintained control during victories earlier in the
week against the Magic and the Miami Heat, finishing a four-game trip
with a 2-2 mark. In losses to the New Jersey Nets and Philadelphia
76ers to start the trip, they committed 23 turnovers in each game.</TE>
<TE>   "Straightening it out means playing hard and not turning the ball
over," Gentry said. "It's something we've had problems with all year.
It's something we've got to get corrected."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers did not practice Saturday, in keeping with Gentry's
philosophy of giving his players a day off after they play on
consecutive nights.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando-Portland was the first of 19 sets this season of games on
back-to-back nights. They have another set today against the Seattle
SuperSonics and Monday against the Golden State Warriors at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Clippers were 11-9 in the first game of those
played on consecutive nights, but only 5-15 in the second.</TE>

Kings put the SuperSonics alone in first place in the Pacific
Division. The SuperSonics are off to their best start since
1999-2000, when they opened with a 9-2 mark. After losing their first

<HD>Georgia Reels In Title on Johnson's Catch</HD>
<DH>Late touchdown reception helps Bulldogs top Auburn, 24-21,
to clinch SEC East and spot in conference championship game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Michael Johnson went up for the ball and Georgia hasn't come down
yet.</LD>
<LD>   David Greene threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to a leaping Johnson
on fourth and long with 1 minute 25 seconds remaining to help No. 7
Georgia defeat No. 24 Auburn, 24-21, Saturday, giving the Bulldogs
their first Southeastern Conference East Division title.</LD>
<LD>   "I know it's only the East, but we're champions tonight," Coach
Mark Richt said.</LD>
<TE>   Three straight incompletions by Greene and a false-start penalty
set up fourth and 15, but Greene pump-faked, then lofted his pass
into the left corner of the end zone. Johnson, subbing for an injured
Terrence Edwards, outjumped former Georgia signee Horace Willis for
the touchdown reception.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost our best receiver, then [Johnson] comes out and makes one
of the best catches in Georgia history," Greene said.</TE>
<TE>   The play was called 70-X-Takeoff, and it launched the Bulldogs to
the championship game for the first time. The Bulldogs, 10-1 overall,
7-1 in the conference, earned a shot at their first conference title
since 1982 and ended a three-game losing streak to the Tigers (7-4,
4-3).</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to Atlanta," linebacker Tony Gilbert said. "We should
have been there a long, long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   Auburn took over at its 28 with 1:18 to play, and Jason Campbell
quickly hit Robert Johnson over the middle for a 25-yard gain.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgia defense resumed its second-half dominance after that,
with a sack by Boss Bailey and two Auburn penalties leaving Auburn
with fourth and 20. Campbell's pass to Tre Smith fell well short of
the first-down marker with 19 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia players raced over to celebrate with their fans, and
Edwards helped Kareem Marshall unfurl a banner proclaiming the
Bulldogs champions.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards also couldn't resist a dig at their biggest East rival.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell those Florida Gators they don't have to play anymore," he
crowed after Johnson's catch.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers, who still have title hopes in the West, slumped off
the field. The only time they trailed in the game was over the final
85 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's last four victories in the series have come at
Jordan-Hare Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Greene completed 18 of 35 passes for 232 yards with an
interception. Playing without Edwards (separated right shoulder) and
Damien Gary (left leg injury), he passed for only 29 yards in the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson had caught 11 passes coming in but finished with 13
receptions for 141 yards and the final touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn led, 14-3, at halftime behind Ronnie Brown's 103 yards
rushing, including a 53-yard touchdown. Brown had 10 second-half
carries for 21 yards, struggling after injuring his right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Jason Campbell was 12 for 23 for 133 yards with two
first-quarter interceptions. He also rushed for 72 yards despite
getting sacked four times.</TE>

<HD>D'wildcat Needs No Help in This Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since March 10, 2001, D'wildcat won a race without
the help of the stewards.</LD>
<LD>   Taking advantage of a quick pace in the $300,000 Frank J.
DeFrancis Memorial Dash over a sloppy track at Laurel Park, the
4-year-old Forest Wildcat colt and 6-1 third choice beat 16-1 shot
Deer Run by nearly two lengths in 1:10 4/5 for the six furlongs.
Jorge Chavez rode the winner for trainer Bob Hess Jr. and the Fog
City Stable in the Grade I race.</LD>
<LD>   The beneficiary of disqualifications in two victories earlier this
year at Churchill Downs and Del Mar, D'wildcat collected his biggest
win in a race marred by an injury to 11-10 favorite Thunderello.</LD>
<TE>   Wheeled back in three weeks after his half-length loss to
Orientate at 48-1 in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, the 3-year-old
Montbrook colt was pulled up on the turn by jockey Edgar Prado and
was vanned off the track. According to trainer Scott Lake, he
suffered a recurrence of a suspensory injury that had kept him
sidelined for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The other disappointment in the DeFrancis was Avanzado. Perfect in
his first three starts at Del Mar and Belmont Park after arriving
from South America, the 5-year-old finished ahead of only Thunderello
under jockey Tyler Baze.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another crack at two turns could be next for Puxa Saco after she
earned her fourth win in five starts in the $100,000 Moccasin Stakes
at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   An appearance in the $250,000 Hollywood Starlet on Dec. 14 is a
possibility after the 2-year-old Dehere filly and 4-5 favorite
remained unbeaten in two races in California with a two-length
victory over 5-2 third choice Watching You.</TE>
<TE>   Four weeks after she won the Anoakia at Santa Anita, Puxa Saco
saved ground throughout under jockey Mike Smith, then took command in
the final eighth of a mile to win in 1:21 4/5 for the seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Richard Rowan and trained by Jenine Sahadi, Puxa Saco has
run beyond seven furlongs only once and that resulted in her only
loss.</TE>
<TE>   She finished third behind the talented Ivanavinalot in the Brave
Raj at Calder on Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   Whether she shows up in the Grade I remains open to debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to watch the race where she ran third," said Sahadi. "I
don't know. We'll have to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who also won last year's Moccasin with the frontrunning
Ayanna, is optimistic about Puxa Saco's future.</TE>
<TE>   "She's getting more professional with each race," he said. "The
race before, she waited a lot and was a little green through the
lane. When I asked her to run today, she really finished up well."</TE>
<TE>   Watching You, who added Lasix on Saturday after winning her career
debut last month at Santa Anita, finished 5 1/2 lengths clear of 2-1
second choice Atlantic Ocean, who has yet to do much to justify her
$1.9-million price tag.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Uriah, an 8-1 shot making her first start in the United States
after winning four of six in Germany, rallied along the rail to
prevail by a nose over 15-1 outsider Sunstone in the $150,000 Long
Island Handicap at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Gary Tanaka and trained by Harro Remmert -- although she
was saddled by Mark Hennig Saturday -- the 3-year-old Acatenango
filly completed 1 1/2 miles on soggy turf in 2:42 2/5. Norberto
Arroyo Jr. was the winning rider.</TE>
<TE>   Moon Queen, the 2-1 favorite who was making her first start since
Feb. 17 for trainer Christophe Clement, finished 11th and last.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Jerry Bailey won two of the four stakes in Calder's
all-stakes pick four, scoring with heavy favorites Miesque's Approval
($3) in the $150,000 Bonnie Heath Turf Cup Handicap and Best Of The
Rest ($2.80) in the $200,000 Carl G. Rose Classic Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   The other two winners were Coolbythepool ($11.20) in the $200,000
Elmer Heubeck Distaff Handicap and Tour Of The Cat ($8.80) in the
$150,000 Jack Dudley Sprint Handicap.</TE>

<LD>Woodland Hills Taft, The Times' No. 5-ranked team, received the top
seeding Saturday in the City Section football playoffs. Taft (10-0)
is the only undefeated team in the section and effectively clinched
the No. 1 slot by defeating Lake Balboa Birmingham, 30-6, Friday
night to win the West Valley League title.</LD>
<LD>   Marine League champion Carson (8-2) and Coliseum League champion
Crenshaw (7-3) were seeded second and third, respectively. Venice
(8-2), the Western League champion, was seeded No. 4. The top eight
seeds host first-round games.</LD>
<LD>   "Taft deserves to be No. 1," Carson Coach John Aguirre said. "They
beat us head to head. They're going to be tough to beat."</LD>
<TE>   A section committee selected the top 32 teams out of 49 in the
section, with the first 16 playing in the Championship division. The
next 16 will play for the Invitational title.</TE>
<TE>   Taft, which lost the City title to Dorsey on the final play of the
championship game last season, will open against 16th-seeded
Wilmington Banning (4-6) as first-round play begins Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Taft Coach Troy Starr said he puts no special value on being the
top seed. "The year we won it, we were the seventh seed," he said. "I
think they did a good job of seeding overall."</TE>
<TE>   Carson hosts Jefferson (5-5), Crenshaw faces Western League
runner-up Fairfax (6-3) and Venice will host Fremont (8-2).</TE>
<TE>   "I think our seed was very fair," Venice Coach Angelo Gasca said.
"I think we've got one of the better first-round games. Fremont is a
very good team."</TE>

<LD>Downey Warren's volleyball team doesn't have anyone taller than 5
feet 9 on its roster, and Saturday night the Bears' lack of height
and their opponent's abundance of it finally caught up with them.</LD>
<LD>   Fourth-seeded Temecula Chaparral rallied to defeat No. 5 Warren,
11-15, 15-8, 15-12, 15-11, in a Southern Section Division I-A
quarterfinal playoff match at Downey High.</LD>
<LD>   The victory gave Chaparral its first semifinal berth after the
Pumas had been eliminated in the quarterfinals each of the last four
seasons.</LD>
<TE>   Sophomore Kelli Tennant led the Pumas (24-8) with 26 kills and
Creighton-bound outside hitter Kandace Scarlett had 19 kills and five
digs. Setters Savanah Parra and Kylie Morel had 32 and 26 assists,
respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "It meant a lot to me to be a part of this, and it meant a lot to
the seniors who got to the quarters the last four years," Tennant
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the loss, the match also meant a lot to Warren.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears (27-2) also had been trying for their first semifinal
berth, with an undersized team that consistently overachieved behind
sisters Jessie and Jenny Shull and 5-9 middle blocker Brianne Huff,
the tallest player on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Jessie, a 5-6 senior setter, had 28 assists against Chaparral and
Jenny, a 5-4 junior outside hitter, had 26 kills.</TE>
<TE>   But neither their efforts, nor 13 kills and four blocks by Huff
were enough against the Pumas, who had seven players 5-11 and taller.</TE>
<TE>   It was a familiar predicament, but one the Bears had previously
been able to overcome with intelligent, effective ball control and
scrappy, competitive play.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears entered Saturday with a 23-match winning streak, their
only loss coming in a four-game match against Long Beach Wilson in
the championship match of the Gahr Tournament. Wilson is the
top-seeded team in the Division I-AA playoffs and the top-ranked team
in The Times' rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows we're not an offensive powerhouse," first-year
Coach Scott Lane said. "We outhustle people, that's it."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears were disappointed they couldn't do it again against
Chaparral.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a good team, just a real good unit," Jenny Shull said. "I
felt like we were in every game and we did what we could."</TE>
<TE>   -- Lauren Peterson</TE>
<TE>   *The expansion that occurred within Southern Section Division V
boys' water polo had a big impact in the quarterfinals of the
playoffs. That's when division newcomers La Verne Damien, Chino Hills
Ayala and Upland earned victories.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala scored an 8-7 upset over fourth-seeded Palm Desert, Upland
knocked off third-seeded Murrieta Valley, 8-5, and second-seeded
Damien slipped by Claremont, 10-6. The other semifinalist is
top-seeded Riverside Poly, which defeated Redlands, 18-5. Coin flips
Monday will determine game sites for semifinals on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "These teams have been playing each other all season and it has
stayed competitive out there," said Riverside Poly Coach Mark
Colwell. "From the beginning, everybody said any one of the top six
teams could win the title."</TE>
<TE>   The division was forced to add Division VI teams Damien and Ayala
and Division III's Upland after those programs were forced to switch
leagues when rival schools eliminated water polo for budget reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Poly (26-4), which also switched leagues, will get a
much-anticipated rematch with Ayala, which defeated the Bears, 12-10,
in a league game two weeks ago, forcing a three-way tie for first
with Damien.</TE>
<TE>   Ayala (24-6), which lost a coin flip and had to settle for the
league's No. 3 entrant, eliminated visiting Palm Desert on a
last-second man-advantage goal by Daniel Blyskol.</TE>

<LD>A technology revolution is underway in college recruiting, with
letters and phone calls headed the way of the Pony Express, replaced
by computers, e-mail and instant messaging.</LD>
<LD>   The days when college athletic programs spent large sums on mass
mailings could be ending thanks to the simple idea of sending out
messages, promotions and recruiting pitches via e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   High school athletes who signed letters of intent on Wednesday are
part of a new generation comfortable communicating with college
coaches via computers instead of just telephones.</LD>
<TE>   Schools can send out as many e-mails as they want to recruits who
are seniors and juniors. In most sports, they cannot contact juniors
by phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it because a coach can only call once a week," said
Newhall Hart shortstop Chris Valaika, who ended up signing with UC
Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Valaika saved money by not having to place long-distance telephone
calls to coaches at Santa Barbara, Nebraska, Baylor and Fresno State.
He just e-mailed them. And the coaches didn't have to keep calling at
all hours hoping to find Valaika at home. They, too, e-mailed him.
It's faster, cheaper and easier to respond.</TE>
<TE>   College coaches are barred from making phone calls to juniors, but
not from sending e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   Mindy Kolani, the mother of junior basketball player Jordan Farmar
of Woodland Hills Taft High, receives close to a dozen e-mails from
college coaches a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost a second job for me," she said. "I'm trying to
respond to everybody. I'm answering them much quicker and trying to
be receptive. I think it's real effective. It gets us talking."</TE>
<TE>   Even coaches have come to appreciate the changes in technology.</TE>
<TE>   "You can communicate to a lot of people in one message," UC Irvine
baseball Coach John Savage said. "They can get back to you quicker."</TE>
<TE>   But the potential for abuse also exists. Coaches aren't permitted
to initiate unlimited phone calls. Some schools believe the instant
messaging component available with Internet services can be used to
violate the spirit of the NCAA rule.</TE>
<TE>   All a recruit needs to do is get on a coach's so-called "buddy"
list. As soon as the coach is online, the recruit is notified and can
legally initiate a conversation. Coaches could have e-mail
conversations with ninth and 10th graders, which they aren't supposed
to do on a telephone. And monitoring coaches on the Internet would
prove difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Delise O'Meally of the NCAA said schools are asking questions and
seeking a consensus on how to respond to the changes in communication
technology.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the discussions has centered around technology and instant
messages," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One recruiter says e-mail conversations have become particularly
popular with female athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "I use it often," said heavily recruited Torrance Bishop
Montgomery basketball player Noelle Quinn, who signed with UCLA.
"It's right there, easy access."</TE>
<TE>   Florida was sending softball player Jaisa Creps of Valencia a
"thought of the day" via e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   But her mother, Julie, didn't mind receiving letters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of fun to go to the mailbox," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran college coaches are having to learn new skills to
communicate via computers. Or they are turning to their young
assistant coaches to keep pace with the changing technology.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still old school, pen and pencil, letters and telephone calls
and go watch them," USC baseball Coach Mike Gillespie said. "It is a
changing world. This whole technology thing has sure changed the face
of [recruiting], and I suppose we can't get left behind."</TE>

<LD>Thanks to upsets by, among others, Genie Magic and the promising
rookie Ghostzapper, pick-six players will have a juicy $114,086
carry-over to shoot for this afternoon at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The sequence begins with the fourth race, a $12,500 claimer for
older fillies and mares, then continues with a 2-year-old maiden
turfer, a $40,000 claiming sprint for 2-year-old fillies, a
2-year-old allowance race, another turf affair for older fillies and
mares, before concluding with a $12,500 claimer for 3-year-olds.</LD>
<LD>   Some players may elect to open their ticket with a single. Prime
Step, the 8-5 choice on Russ Hudak's morning line, is the one to
catch as she makes her first start for trainer Jack Carava.</LD>
<TE>   The Prospectors Gamble filly won her last start at Santa Anita by
6 1/2 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh looks like a match race between Our Bobby V. and
Truckle Feature. A gray son of Majesterian, Our Bobby V. beat maidens
by five lengths in his second start at Santa Anita on Oct. 6 while
Truckle Feature drops out of two graded stakes as he returns to
California for trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   The Saint Ballado colt, who broke his maiden at Del Mar, was third
in the Futurity at Belmont Park and third in the Lanes End Breeders'
Futurity at Keeneland in his two most recent appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Golden Gate Fields, Bluesthestandard will make his
first start in Northern California against eight opponents in the
seventh, a $33,000 allowance at six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   A winner of eight of 14 in his career, the 5-year-old American
Standard gelding will be favored under jockey Russell Baze.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Nine 2-year-olds who have combined to win 14 of
28 starts will get together in the $75,000 Huntington at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Carl Nafzger. The trainer, best known for winning the
Kentucky Derby with Unbridled more than a decade ago, won with 10 of
his first 20 starters at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Marlon St. Julien. The jockey won only one of his first
32 at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Key Slouisiana Lew on top in the tri in the
10th to Grand Visions, Notable Secrets and Bold Airman in the two
hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/13. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $3.60/$66.20. Total money bet: $148.</TE>

<HD>Bryant Recovering From Chip Shot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day soon, Shaquille O'Neal will tell Phil Jackson he's ready to
play again.</LD>
<LD>   He recently said Friday night's game against the Chicago Bulls was
a reasonable goal. But O'Neal is nothing if not unpredictable, so the
Lakers keep their minds and hearts open, expect him Friday and pray
for even a minute earlier.</LD>
<LD>   They'll play tonight against the Houston Rockets without O'Neal
for the 10th game. Devean George is day-to-day, Samaki Walker has a
limp, and Kobe Bryant has a swollen lip.</LD>
<TE>   Bryant strode across the parking lot Saturday, smiled through a
lip twice its normal size and said, "I'm all right." He had been to
the dentist after chipping off a piece of an incisor during Friday's
overtime win against Golden State and needing four stitches.</TE>
<TE>   On a light practice day, Bryant was not on the floor during some
three-on-three exercises. O'Neal was. He's close, close enough that
right now he's undoubtedly the best center in the NBA, even on a bum
toe and without the benefit of training camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Once I get back, hopefully everybody's spirits will be up," he
said afterward. "Because I'm the spirit of the team. I'm like the
wolf of the team. Right now, the wolf is missing. We've still got a
lot of eagles, a lot of rabbits, a lot of pigs, but I'm the wolf. So,
once the wolf gets back, we'll get our spirit back. We're just going
to gain momentum and go with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been written more than once in the last week that O'Neal's
absence has ensured his second regular-season MVP award, given the
Lakers' 3-6 record. O'Neal, however, shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "The media likes to throw around 'the best' a lot," he said. "So I
don't respect that word. I don't worry about that title. I don't
respect that title anymore. The title that belongs to me is 'most
dominant.' And I wouldn't even consider myself 'the best.' There are
other players who have greater all-around skills.</TE>
<TE>   "The best has got to be Kobe. Then [Tracy McGrady]. [Tim] Duncan.
[Kevin] Garnett. Guys that can do it all. I really don't do it all.
In the purple area [paint], that's where I am."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. Houston, 6:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KWKW (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 3-6, Rockets 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Rockets (2001-02) -- 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Lakers have won seven in a row in the series, last
season's games by an average of nearly 12 points. They have won five
in a row at Staples Center against the Rockets.</TE>

<LD>Distance fans will be delighted with tonight's card. Five of the nine
races are either 870 yards or 4 1/2 furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   One of the 870 races brings together a couple of old pros -- No
Pet Peeves and Pennants Headlight.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Martha Wells and trained by Dan Francisco, No Pet Peeves,
who has won 17 of 60 and earned close to $195,000, won in his return
against $8,000 claimers Oct. 6 and is entered for the same price
tonight.</LD>
<TE>   A 7-year-old gelded son of The Signature, Pennants Headlight is
drawn right outside No Pet Peeves and will be trying for his 12th win
in his 70th start. He's owned by Jackie and Rod Macpherson Jr. and
trained by John Cooper.</TE>
<TE>   The lone thoroughbred race is a $5,000 claimer and includes Flight
Zone, who has won seven of 15, Wired To Win, who has won three of his
last five starts at Los Alamitos, and the speedy Cielo Canosa, who
finished third after setting the pace in the slop nine nights ago.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Saturdays Promise. 2. Wired To Win. 3. Sheza Ramblin
Too. 4. Brown Effort. 5. Bcr Grab The Cash. 6. Pretty Dashing. 7. No
Pet Peeves. 8. Quanah Cartel. 9. Genester.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Saturdays Promise, Going Going Gone and Don Jose Davalos
in the first, Wired To Win and Induction Day in the second, Sheza
Ramblin Too and Pj Flying Phoebe in the third and A Blurr and Brown
Effort in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Just A Dasher probably needed his last and
could wake up in the sixth. Tougherthantherest steps up in the
seventh after being claimed by Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 5:30 p.m.</TE>

<LD>   Steve Nash scored 30 points, Michael Finley had 20 points and 13
rebounds, and Dirk Nowitzki had 18 points and 12 rebounds for the
Mavericks.</LD>
<LD>   With a record of 10-0, the Mavericks are the league's only
unbeaten team.</LD>
<TE>   "People can play a lot of years in this league and never start
10-0," Shawn Bradley said. "What determines how neat of a start this
is depends on what we do from here."</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey was held to five points in the last 5:50. Dallas is
giving up 89 points per game after giving up 101 last season -- the
second-highest opponents' average in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "Sacramento exposed our lack of defense in the second round of the
playoffs," Nash said. "It wasn't there last year, and we know if we
want to do something in the playoffs we first have to get better
defensively."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had 22 points, 13 assists, nine rebounds and five steals. The
Nets lost at home for the first time this season after winning their
first five games.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 93, New York 92 -- Latrell Sprewell played in his
first game this season but couldn't reverse the Knicks' sinking
fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   The 76ers won on the road for the first time this season. The
Knicks lost for the fourth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson and Todd MacCulloch each scored 17 points for the
76ers.</TE>
<TE>   The habitually tardy Sprewell arrived at the arena six minutes
before his team's 11:30 a.m. deadline, then made his first appearance
nine minutes into the game -- the first time he has not started since
the 1999 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell played 31 minutes and had 16 points on six-for-15
shooting but was held scoreless in the last 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 95, Miami 65 -- The Wizards made 22 of 33 shots in the
first half at Washington and Jerry Stackhouse helped send the Heat to
its fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards got eight points from Stackhouse in the third quarter
to lead by 30 points. Stackhouse finished with 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fewest points ever given up by the Wizards. The
previous low had been 69 points.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 90, Cleveland 77 -- Bruce Bowen scored 14 points, Tony
Parker had 13 and the Spurs barely needed Tim Duncan to send the host
Cavaliers to their sixth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan spent much of the game in foul trouble and played a
season-low 21 minutes before fouling out with 6:06 left. By then, the
Spurs led by 19 points. Duncan scored six points.</TE>
<TE>   Ricky Davis had 22 points for the Cavaliers, who have not won
since beating the Lakers on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Golden State 135, Orlando 92 -- Troy Murphy had a career-high 24
points and 12 rebounds, and Gilbert Arenas had 23 points at Oakland,
leading the Warriors to their biggest victory in nearly nine years.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors ended a five-game skid against the Magic, which lost
for the third time in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy McGrady, the league's top scorer, had 33 points for Orlando
despite sitting out the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 107, Minnesota 101 -- Reserve Ron Mercer scored 22 points
and Jermaine O'Neal scored 12 of his 20 points in the second half at
Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Off to their best start since the 1969-70 season in the ABA, the
Pacers won their seventh consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana never trailed and survived a fourth-quarter rally by the
Timberwolves.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett led the Minnesota with 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 104, Boston 85 -- Ray Allen scored a season-high 31
points, including 18 in the first half, and Sam Cassell scored 25 to
help the Bucks defeat the Celtics for the seventh consecutive time at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker scored 21 of his 28 points in the first half, and
Paul Pierce had 28 points for Boston, which was playing its fourth
game in six days.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 89, New Orleans 82 -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 27 points
and Glenn Robinson scored 24 to lead the Hawks at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Theo Ratliff had a career-high 17 rebounds and blocked five shots
for the Hawks, who made 20 of 30 free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 111, Memphis 93 -- Donyell Marshall scored 31 points and
had 17 rebounds, and Jalen Rose scored 31 points at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis (0-10) remained the league's only team without a victory.
The Grizzlies are 0-2 since Hubie Brown took over as coach.</TE>

<HD>West Goes With a Grizzled Veteran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hope you liked the honeymoon, 'cause here comes the marriage....</LD>
<LD>   Jerry West, Laker icon turned Grizzlies' reason to hope, knew hard
times were coming but he didn't necessarily think they had to start
opening night.</LD>
<LD>   A man who lived with enough fear in his own career, he is loath to
fire people if he has a choice, which was one reason he kept Sidney
Lowe, the nice-guy Memphis coach with the 79-220 career record he
inherited and crossed his fingers.</LD>
<TE>   That lasted two whole weeks before he felt obliged to tell Lowe he
had flunked the audition. While a journey of 1,000 miles might start
with a single step, the Grizzlies were 0-8 and still at the starting
line.</TE>
<TE>   West then shocked the (basketball) world with his choice as
successor, Hubie Brown. This was not just a surprise because Hubie is
69 and hasn't coached in 15 years, but because no one knew he had a
friend left who would hire him.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there isn't logic behind it. It's like West hiring Del
Harris in 1994 to teach his young Lakers traditional NBA values.
Harris took a 33-49 team to 53-29 in two seasons, making it possible
to recruit Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal, who wouldn't have come if they
had still been rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Delmer was a kindly grandfather type. Hubie is more
like an elderly pit bull.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN's Bill Walton, who has worked with Brown on TV, now claims
Hubie is "very much calmed down" and "mellowed."</TE>
<TE>   Or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I've just been laughing for the last 15 minutes, wondering if
he's lost his mind," Louisville Coach Rick Pitino, a former Brown
assistant, told the Memphis Commercial Appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is from the Old, Old, School, before they outlawed corporal
punishment. He drove players profanely and in a way that would now be
called abusive (e.g., referring to Atlanta Hawk star John Drew as
"cement head" and "moron").</TE>
<TE>   He was disliked by peers, not that he conceded he had very many.
In his favorite off-season activity, speaking (down) at clinics, he
sneered openly at opposing coaches, especially such former players as
Billy Cunningham and Kevin Loughery. Sports Illustrated's Bruce
Newman captured Brown in a memorable piece. Years later, still
resisting the thought that he might be the source of his own
problems, pausing for emphasis in his inimitable style, Brown told
another SI writer:</TE>
<TE>   "That ... [expletive] ... story ... ruined ... my ... [expletive]
... life!"</TE>
<TE>   Just because he was pedantic, strident and/or obnoxious, however,
didn't mean Brown couldn't coach. He started a school of NBA coaches,
the so-called "Five Star Guys," who'd met as college assistants at
Howard Garfinkel's Five Star Camp for prep players in western
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Pitino's first NBA job was on Brown's Knick staff. Mike Fratello
was an assistant in Atlanta. Chuck Daly was an assistant with Hubie
on Vic Bubas' Duke staff in the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   The Five Star Guys were mostly fire-eating overachieving little
Catholic League guards who revered their coaches and expected to be
treated the same way.</TE>
<TE>   They were mutts, fighting their way up from Podunk schools (in his
late 30s, Daly was still coaching high school in Punxutawney, Pa.).
They worked harder and knew more Xs and O's, but the NBA
players-turned-coaches got the jobs as head coaches with the best
teams. The Five Star Guys considered themselves blessed to get a
$20,000-a-year job as No. 3 assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Five Star Guys were driven, and some were out of control. A
general manager once said you had to watch them; sometimes they
weren't just staying up nights watching videotape or drawing Xs and
O's on napkins in diners, but scheming to get your job.</TE>
<TE>   West's heretofore innocent/clueless Kiddie Corps is about to learn
a new bare-knuckle philosophy. Talk about your duel of titans: Mr.
Authority meets the rebel chieftain, hard-headed, tattoo-adorned
Jason Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, he told us it's either his way or the highway,"
forward Stromile Swift said after their first meeting with Brown. "I
don't know how well a lot of the players are going to accept him, so
it's going to be interesting."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, you could color Swift gone.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, West may have felt obliged to go for broke,
with so many normal avenues to advancement, such as draft picks and
free agents, already cut off.</TE>
<TE>   He not only has the league's youngest roster, playing in its
smallest market, but the residue of years of bumbling that has
littered the franchise with mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Michael Heisley's first move, upon taking over two seasons
ago, was to hire a family friend, Dick Versace, to head the
operation, missing the fact that the blabby former coach and
broadcaster wasn't unemployed by accident.</TE>
<TE>   Versace, now powerless, still rattles around the organizational
directory at $3 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   On their way out of Vancouver, Heisley ordered Versace to dump
salary, which was why Mike Bibby became a star in Sacramento, rather
than Memphis. Then, without consulting Versace, Heisley signed
Williams and Michael Dickerson to $43-million extensions. Dickerson
promptly got hurt and has played six games since.</TE>
<TE>   They're still paying for ancient mistakes, such as the 1997 trade
of next spring's No. 1 pick to Detroit (unless the Grizzlies draw the
first overall pick).</TE>
<TE>   In return, they got grumpy, old Otis Thorpe, whose career with the
Grizzlies lasted 51 games.</TE>
<TE>   West inherited an outlandish $61-million payroll, which means they
will pay about $8 million in luxury tax ... and won't get the $3
million in returned escrow from players that goes to teams under the
tax threshold ... and they have no cap space.</TE>
<TE>   With young prospects Pau Gasol, Drew Gooden and Shane Battier,
they still could have a future.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, Hubie really has mellowed and enough of them will
survive their indoctrination to pursue it locally.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Dear Donald (cont.): Clipper officials keep asking when the
free-agents-without-contracts story will go away so they can get on
with their season. Try never, as last week's trip to Miami
demonstrated. The rebuilding Heat will have cap room next summer and
alert local reporters fanned out over the Clipper dressing room to
see who might be interested. Said Michael Olowokandi: "I'm not sure
if before the games that the mind-set of the guys [is on contracts].
We want to play and win for pride. We're not doing it to show
management but for the team. It would be nice if management did [take
care of its players], but I very much doubt it." Said Lamar Odom,
remembering his pre-draft workout in Miami: "I feel like in those
couple of days I built a little relationship with Coach [Pat Riley.]
Maybe we'll meet up again one day. I hope so." Even Riley got into
it, acknowledging: "I think a lot of GMs -- I know I do -- look at
their roster and it's just loaded with talent, young talent."</TE>
<TE>   There was a lot of speculation for the San Antonio-New Jersey game
last week, since Tim Duncan talks freely about how wanting to play
with his friend, upcoming free agent Jason Kidd. However, Spur
insiders say the team hopes that Tony Parker will be their point
guard, allowing them to sign a center to replace the retiring David
Robinson -- with Olowokandi as first choice. On the other hand, if
Duncan, who can opt out too, is down on Parker at season's end and
tells them to go after Kidd, that's what the Spurs will do.</TE>
<TE>   Utah elder John Stockton, who spurns publicity in the best of
times, is upset at all the questions he's getting about retiring as
he and Karl Malone approach free agency and the team struggles. "I
get tired of hearing my name after a while and I know people out
there are too," he said. "If it were me, I'd be thinking, 'Retire
already. Or don't retire. Whatever.' I guess I take it as part of the
territory. But you can only beat so much out of a dead mule." ...
Duh: Portland General Manager Bob Whitsitt, defying conventional
wisdom once more, signed free agents Jeff McInnis and Antonio
Daniels, now -- surprise! -- having trouble dividing time with
starter Damon Stoudamire. McInnis stomped out of the dressing room
after not getting in one game, then played the next two while
Stoudamire, averaging 7.8 points and shooting 35%, argued with Coach
Maurice Cheeks on the bench....</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Cavaliers' Ricky Davis and Tyrone Hill complained
that management wouldn't sign Rod Strickland, leaving them with Bimbo
Coles and Milt Palacio at the point. Coach John Lucas, walking a
tightrope, since he wanted Strickland too, said he told his players
to look at it this way: "You guys probably want Phil Jackson [as
coach]. I probably want these guys [Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant].
What we have is each other and that's good enough for me." Davis then
argued with Coles in a game, was taken out and refused to take part
in warmups before the second half.... Turner Sports' John Thompson,
ending a discussion of what went wrong for Denver's Rodney White in
Detroit as White fired off a 20-foot airball: "Did you see that shot?
That's what went wrong."</TE>

<TE>   Hubie Brown became the second-oldest coach in NBA history this
week at 69 when he was hired by the Memphis Grizzlies. Only Bill
Bertka, the longtime Laker assistant who coached the team for one
game in 1999 at 71, was older. The 10 oldest active coaches:</TE>

<LD>MARK HEISLER'S NBA COMMENTS AND RANKINGS:</LD>
<LD>   GAME OF THE WEEK</LD>
<LD>   LAKERS AT SAN ANTONIO</LD>
<TE>*--*
    Team (W-L)           Comment (last week's position)
1   DALLAS (10-0)        Could be schedule or top teams futzing
                         around. Or Mavericks could be a lot better.
                         (4)
2   SACRAMENTO  (6-4)    No one has a backup like Bobby Jackson,
                         averaging 17.6 while Bibby is out. (2)
3   NEW JERSEY  (7-3)    Huh? East was 54 games under .500 last
                         season, started the weekend 10 over. (5)
4   DETROIT  (8-2)       Little early to anoint Carlisle as some guys
                         are, but this is still impressive. (8)
5   INDIANA (8-1)        So far, so good for embattled Isiah and his
                         not- previously-ready-for-prime-time kids.
                         (9)
6   SAN ANTONIO  (6-4)   Ginobili back on bench. Until or unless he
                         pans out, Spurs still lack firepower. (1)
7   NEW ORLEANS  (7-3)   Baron, misplaced strong safety, in top 10 in
                         assists, minutes, three-pointers, steals.
                         (7)
8   SEATTLE  (7-2)       No. 1 in three-point shooting (45%). Only
                         Celtics, Mavericks and Bucks make more. (14)
9   BOSTON (6-4)         Celtics were rolling along nicely until
                         crashing into Mavericks and Bucks. (11)
10  PHILADELPHIA  (6-3)  Lot better than last year when 76ers began
                         0-5 and Larry Brown told pals he was gone.
                         (10)
11  ORLANDO  (6-4)       No one can cover spread-court offense, but
                         there's that 101-a-game defense. (6)
12  MINNESOTA (5-6)      It would be sad if Timberwolves had their
                         golden age and no one noticed. (12)
13  PHOENIX  (5-3)       Took two seasons to get to it, but Suns are
                         4-1 with Penny, Marbury sharing point. (15)
14  WASHINGTON  (6-4)    Jordan's turning up minutes as he finds this
                         season his knees can take it. (20)
15  HOUSTON  (4-3)       With headaches gone, Stevie Franchise is up
                         from 22 a game and 42%, to 28-49%. (16)
16  PORTLAND  (4-6)      Rasheed perked up for Cheeks last season,
                         now averaging 7.0 rebounds. (19)
17  MILWAUKEE (5-4)      Small dog: Thomas averaging 11 points, or
                         one for every $1 million of salary. (21)
18  TORONTO  (4-4)       Just like last spring, except now Raptors
                         are hanging in without Vince and Antonio.
                         (22)
19  ATLANTA  (5-4)       Ratliff picks it up with 20 points, 20
                         rebounds, eight blocks in two games. (17)
20  CLIPPERS  (3-6)      As the family patriarch in "Moonstruck"
                         says, "Quick, someone tell a joke." (18)
21  LAKERS  (3-6)        Goodbye fairy-tale scenario: Big Toe all
                         better, they live happily ever after. (3)
22  UTAH  (3-7)          If Jazz thinks this is bad, wait until what
                         comes after Karl and John. (13)
23  CHICAGO  (4-6)       Why mollify never-happened Jamal Crawford by
                         taking minutes from Jay Williams? (23)
24  CLEVELAND  (2-8)     Tyrone Hill and Ricky Davis must have missed
                         part about getting into the LeBron Derby.
                         (24)
25  NEW YORK  (1-8)      So much for Spree riding over hill to save
                         the day: He returns, Knicks lose. (25)
26  MIAMI  (1-7)         Riley: "I'm humbled. Take my name off the
                         marquee." Hey, Pat, it might get worse. (26)
27  GOLDEN STATE (3-8)   Arenas making rare switch from off guard to
                         point, averaging big-time 16-7-7. (27)
28  DENVER  (2-7)        Where have you gone, Paul Westhead? Nuggets
                         score 53 against Pistons. (28)
29  MEMPHIS  (0-10)      Kids get taste of way we were, as Hubie
                         starts with three days of two-a-days. (29)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   When -- Wednesday. Time -- 5:30 PST. TV -- Channel 9.</TE>
<TE>   Story line -- Because the Spurs won the first meeting, they're in
position to go up 2-0 in the season series before seeing Shaquille
O'Neal in uniform. The Lakers won once here without Shaq and another
one without Kobe Bryant in the last two seasons, so anything is
technically possible.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUBURN HILLS, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Cliff Robinson scored 17 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter to
help the Detroit Pistons beat the Denver Nuggets, 74-53, Saturday
night after the teams combined for the lowest-scoring first half in
NBA history.</LD>
<LD>   Denver led, 29-28, at halftime, and the 57 combined points broke a
47-year-old record by one point. The Nuggets shot 37.5% in the half
and committed eight turnovers. The Pistons shot 29% and had 11
turnovers.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit set a franchise record for points given up and it was the
lowest-scoring game in Piston history.</LD>
<TE>   The Nuggets set a team record for fewest points in a game. Denver
shot 32.8% and finished with 22 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit outscored Denver, 18-12, in the third quarter for a 46-41
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit started the fourth quarter with a 7-2 run, extending its
lead to 53-43 with 7:10 to play. Denver turned the ball over four
times in the first five minutes of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The previous record of 58 points in a first half was set by
Syracuse and Fort Wayne at Buffalo, N.Y., on Jan. 25, 1955, and was
tied by Dallas and Indiana on Feb. 13, 1998.</TE>

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>   *** New Orleans (7-2) at Atlanta (5-3-1), 10 a.m.: Despite
rallying for an overtime tie against Pittsburgh last week, Falcons
gave up a franchise-worst 645 yards. Now, they get to play the
league's most prolific offense. LINE: Atlanta by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Cleveland (4-5) at Cincinnati (1-8), 10 a.m.: From the
desperate-times-call-for-desperate-measures dept.: Cincinnati ticket
scalpers took out radio ads this week offering deals on seats for
this enticing matchup at below face value. LINE: Cleveland by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Dallas (3-6) at Indianapolis (5-4), 10 a.m.: The good news for
Cowboys: They've given up only 35 points in their last three games.
The bad news: They lost all three. LINE: Indianapolis by 7.</TE>
<TE>   *** Buffalo (5-4) at Kansas City (4-5), 10 a.m., Channel 2:
Against two of league's best offenses, lightly regarded Chief defense
shut out 49ers in the second half and gave up only one touchdown to
the Raiders. Does Kansas City's luck run out against a rested Drew
Bledsoe? LINE: Kansas City by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Green Bay (8-1) at Minnesota (2-7), 10 a.m.: If the NFL's
parity label attaches itself to this game, then it should matter that
in 10 Metrodome starts, Brett Favre-led teams have lost eight. Just
trying to drum up some interest. LINE: Green Bay by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Washington (4-5) at New York Giants (5-4), 10 a.m., KNX (1070):
Redskin linebacker Jesse Armstead, who was cut by the Giants in a
salary-cap move, can't let go. "When you have that red and blue in
your veins, it's hard to ever get that out of your system." LINE: New
York by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Arizona (4-5) at Philadelphia (6-3), 10 a.m.: Both teams are
reeling -- the Cardinals more than the Eagles -- but Philadelphia
fans can't be happy to see Jake Plummer come to town. Five of
Plummer's 20 fourth-quarter comeback wins have been against the
Eagles. LINE: Philadelphia by 11.</TE>
<TE>   *** Pittsburgh (5-3-1) at Tennessee (5-4), 10 a.m.: Former
division rivals meet in battle of division leaders -- the Steelers
atop the AFC North and the Titans in the South. They are not
definitely scheduled to play again until 2005. LINE: Pittsburgh by 3.</TE>
<TE>   *** San Francisco (7-2) at San Diego (6-3), 1 p.m., Channel 11: As
if Chargers needed more reason to worry that their season is
unraveling, they haven't beaten 49ers since 1982, when Dan Fouts was
the Charger quarterback. LINE: San Francisco by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Carolina (3-6) at Tampa Bay (7-2), 1 p.m.: Carolina rookie
Coach John Fox says, "We're so close to being a good football team we
can smell it." Panthers will get their noses plugged this week by
having to play on the road. LINE: Tampa Bay by 9.</TE>
<TE>   *** Baltimore (4-5) at Miami (5-4), 1:15 p.m., KNX (1070):
Remember Ricky Williams? The guy who averaged 131 yards in first
three games, 69.5 in the last six? He guarantees Miami will make
playoffs. Push had better start today. LINE: Miami by 4 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** New York Jets (4-5) at Detroit (3-6), 1:15 p.m.: Jets have
stuck it to Miami and San Diego the last two weeks, but which New
York team will show up? Plus, the Lions have won their last three at
home after winning only two -- home or road -- all of last season.
LINE: New York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   * Jacksonville (4-5) at Houston (2-7), 1:15 p.m.: Dallas will have
a rooting interest in this one. A Jaguar loss would be their second
of the season to the expansion Texans, a fact Cowboys can point to
when their fans bring up the season-opening, nationally televised
embarrassment. LINE: Jacksonville by 6.</TE>
<TE>   ** Denver (6-3) at Seattle (3-6), 1:15 p.m., Channel 2: Is it
possible the Broncos will come out slow again after their debacle
against the Raiders on Monday night? Seahawk linebacker Orlando Huff
thinks so: "Bring the wood because they don't like to play physical."
LINE: Denver by 5.</TE>
<TE>   **** New England (5-4) at Oakland (5-4), 5:30 p.m., ESPN, KMPC
(1540), KLSX-FM (97.1): Revenge factor alone makes this must-see TV.
You never want to anger Raider fans, but when they've had 10 months
to ponder what happened in the New England snow in January, it's
scary. LINE: Oakland by 3 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   ** Chicago (2-7) at St. Louis (4-5), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel 7,
KNX (1070): Everyone talks about Marc Bulger's having led the Rams
out of their 0-5 hole, but if Marshall Faulk can't play because of
ankle and tendon injuries, even the hard-luck Bears might take
advantage. LINE: No line.</TE>

<LD>On the Web site www.despair.com, which is not the official home of
the Cincinnati Bengal Fan Club, they sell a beautiful full-color
lithograph of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in all its ill-conceived
glory.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath the tower is an inscription:</LD>
<LD>   MEDIOCRITY</LD>
<TE>   It Takes A Lot Less Time And Most People Won't Notice The
Difference Until It's Too Late</TE>
<TE>   At last! A perfectly acceptable marketing slogan for the new NFL!</TE>
<TE>   Mediocrity rules!</TE>
<TE>   Mediocrity sells!</TE>
<TE>   Mediocrity wins Super Bowls!</TE>
<TE>   Take a look at this morning's NFL standings. Seven teams are 5-4.
Eight are 4-5. Two, Atlanta and Pittsburgh, are 5-3-1 because they
played last Sunday to a tie, the most mediocre of all results,
because of mediocre special teams play (Pittsburgh had an extra-point
attempt and a field-goal attempt blocked), mediocre officiating
(Plaxico Burress put the ball on the ground and spun it like a bottle
and the officials ruled he hadn't fumbled) and mediocre coaching
(Bill Cowher spent the entire extra period coaching not to lose, and
that's precisely what his Steelers did, 34-34).</TE>
<TE>   All 32 NFL teams have played nine games. Seventeen of them -- more
than half the league -- have either won five games or lost five
games.</TE>
<TE>   Remember home-field advantage? In the new NFL, there is none.
Through this season's first 10 weeks, home teams have won only 53% of
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Remember dynasties? When one or two teams used to dominate the
league for years on end? In the new NFL, dynasties barely last a
month.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland had a good one. Back in September. The Raiders were 4-0.
They were the scourge of the league. Al Davis had regained his genius
stripes, having made the bold, visionary move to get rid of Jon
Gruden, who was obviously a red-faced flash in the pan, as his
season-opening loss to New Orleans conclusively proved.</TE>
<TE>   Commemorative coffee table books were being planned. "Sept. 8-Oct.
6: Minutes We Will Never Forget."</TE>
<TE>   Then, the Raiders went 0-4 before winning last Monday and are now
just another number among the 5-4-or-4-5 masses.</TE>
<TE>   Parity used to be the buzzword around the NFL, but parity implies
equality, as in "All men are created equal," which sounds noble and
desirable and certainly something worth striving for.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocrity is more to the point. Mediocrity, the essence of being
moderate in quality. Of being ordinary. Of being so-so. Better than
lousy, less than good, stuck in the middle with you.</TE>
<TE>   Parity, in its NFL context, is a state achieved via artificial
means, such as the league's infamous weighted schedule, which rewards
bad teams for their badness by giving them easier schedules. For
years, it was the great NFL swindle -- league officials winking and
patting each other on the back for fooling millions of fans into
believing their awful teams were not really so awful on any given
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The media went along with it because, hey, lots of the games are
close and so are the playoff races and as long as we get a credible
champion in the end -- San Francisco or Denver or Green Bay -- what's
the harm in having a little fun along the way?</TE>
<TE>   Then St. Louis and Tennessee reached the Super Bowl in the same
year. The Rams, 4-12 the previous season, won it. Red flags went up.
Eyebrows too. If Georgia Frontiere can tiptoe to the top of the
league, might there be something amiss within the league?</TE>
<TE>   Since then, if you can judge a league by its champion, mediocrity
has swamped the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore won the Super Bowl with half a team -- a formidable but
fragile defense saddled with a pull date of January 2002 and a
just-don't-do-anything-to-gum-it-up offense -- which left us with the
indelible image of Trent Dilfer, poster boy for the New Mediocrity,
hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy after beating Kerry Collins' New
York Giants, the most mediocre NFC champion in memory.</TE>
<TE>   New England won the Super Bowl despite three mediocre months (the
Patriots were 5-5 heading into Thanksgiving) and a mediocre offense
(the Patriots scored three offensive touchdowns during the
postseason) because it capitalized on mediocre officiating in the
divisional playoffs (the "tuck rule"), mediocre quarterbacking in the
AFC final (Kordell Stewart) and a mediocre game plan by Ram Coach
Mike Martz (Marshall Faulk as decoy) in the big game.</TE>
<TE>   Now we are nine games into the 2002 season. The combined record of
the last two Super Bowl champions, Baltimore and New England: 9-9.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens are 4-5. Out of 32 teams, they rank 16th in yards
rushing per game, 17th in yards allowed per game, 16th in
turnover-takeaway ratio and are tied for 15th in first downs allowed
per game. They are tied for second place, or third place, depending
on how you look at it, with Cleveland in the four-team AFC North.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots are 5-4 after being 3-0 and 3-4. They are tied for
first in the AFC East with the Buffalo Bills, who have played three
overtime games, and the Miami Dolphins, who have gone on streaks of
3-0, 0-1, 2-0 and 0-3 this season.</TE>
<TE>   With a few exceptions, such as Green Bay and Cincinnati, the North
and South poles of professional football, mediocrity has covered the
NFL like a beige shag carpet. But, if you take the time to look
closely, you will find that some mediocrities within the league are
more mediocre than others.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocre Team</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins rank 16th in yards gained per game, average gain per
rush, average gain per pass play, third-down efficiency and punt
return average; 17th in field-goal percentage and quarterback sack
percentage; and 18th in gross punting average, average gain allowed
per pass play and first downs allowed per game.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocre Franchise</TE>
<TE>   Since moving east from Cleveland in 1996, the Ravens are 55-55-1
in 6 1/2 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocre Division</TE>
<TE>   The AFC East has three teams tied for first at 5-4, with the New
York Jets a game back at 4-5. Should the Jets beat Detroit today (the
Jets are favored) and the Patriots lose to Oakland (Raiders favored)
and the Bills lose to Kansas City (Chiefs favored) and the Dolphins
lose to Baltimore (Ray Lucas starts at quarterback for Miami), all
four teams in the AFC East will be 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocre Quarterback</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Collins has thrown eight touchdown passes and had nine
passes intercepted in nine games for the 5-4 New York Giants this
season. At 85.2, he is tied for 16th in the league in quarterback
rating. His career regular-season record as an NFL starting
quarterback: 50-47.</TE>
<TE>   Mediocre Matchup</TE>
<TE>   Today, 5-4 Oakland hosts 5-4 New England in a game that has been
touted as a must-see grudge match, considering the events of last
season's Winter Wonderland Playoff Miracle (Patriots' version) or
Criminal Snow Job (Raiders' version). New England's Tedy Bruschi, a
no-nonsense linebacker who will never hold a job in the NFL's public
relations department, had this assessment for the Boston Herald:
"We're both 5-4, and that's nothing to write home about."</TE>

<LD>Those who think that all college coaches in the United States have
the best interests of their players at heart should think again.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, there are NCAA and NAIA coaches who believe their own
job security and won-lost records are more important than their
leading players' right to achieve their full potential.</LD>
<LD>   And such coaches are willing to resort to decidedly dubious
tactics to get their way. Some tactics include threatening to revoke
players' scholarships unless they toe the college line at the expense
of their own national teams.</LD>
<TE>   The eight-nation CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup that ended last Sunday
with the United States beating Canada in the final at the Rose Bowl
provided proof of this selfish attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The national coaches of the countries that finished 1-2-3 in the
tournament -- April Heinrichs of the U.S., Even Pellerud of Canada
and Leonardo Cuellar of Mexico -- all criticized colleges for their
short-sighted and wrong-headed stance.</TE>
<TE>   Canada, Haiti, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago and the U.S. -- more
than half the Gold Cup field, in fact -- all had players barred from
playing in the tournament or yanked out of it at the worst of times
by American college coaches.</TE>
<TE>   And this was a tournament that determined which teams would go to
the Women's World Cup in China next year. It wasn't some fly-by-night
event.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, neither the national teams nor their respective
federations have the power to do anything about it. Because they are
not under the control of any federation, confederation or even FIFA
itself, colleges can go their own way and snub their noses at the
world.</TE>
<TE>   And who is to say the outcome of the Gold Cup itself was not
affected by all this?</TE>
<TE>   What if Canada, for instance, had had reserve defender Sasha
Andrews and backup goalkeeper Erin McLeod available for the final?
They had played in earlier games, so they were not merely
benchwarmers. But Southern Methodist University made them return to
school on the eve of the Gold Cup final.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to go home," said Pellerud, who led Norway to the 1995
Women's World Cup title. "They were threatened to lose the
scholarships if they didn't go home, yes."</TE>
<TE>   Pellerud said Canada could do nothing about it.</TE>
<TE>   "The NCAA is not connected to FIFA, so there is no chance," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   George Van Linder, SMU's coach, told Soccer America magazine that
he and Pellerud had agreed before the Gold Cup that once Canada had
clinched its place in the World Cup by winning its semifinal, Andrews
and McLeod would return to SMU to help qualify for the NCAA playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "[Pellerud] called me before the semifinals and told me he wanted
them longer," Van Linder said. "I told him we'd agreed, and we need
to [stick to the agreement]. He didn't want to. The players felt they
were in a difficult situation -- they wanted to do both. They were
put in a tough situation, and I had to be the bad guy."</TE>
<TE>   Canadian players, however, were not the only ones put into such
awkward positions.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico lost Cristina Rivera before the tournament began because
the University of San Diego refused to release her. Cuellar had to do
without other players as well.</TE>
<TE>   Haiti was left without the services of its top goal scorer, Erlie
Thelot, because Lee University, an NAIA school in Florida, refused to
release her.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad and Tobago lost not one, but three players, a fact
bemoaned by Coach Jamaal Shabazz before the Gold Cup began.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a lot of problems in securing the overseas [U.S. college]
players," Shabazz told the Trinidad Guardian. "The schools did not
want to release these players because of the timing of the [Gold Cup]
tournament, which clashes with their season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have heard that the American NCAA does not recognize the
tournament and as such we could not have used any big sticks to get
these players. It's disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad and Tobago had to make do without defender Teleshia
Joseph and forward April Reyes, both of Central Missouri State, as
well as defender Kesi Ann Francis of Parker College.</TE>
<TE>   Even the U.S. had to dicker with colleges over the sharing of
players during the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   That's why midfielder Aly Wagner played for the U.S. on a Saturday
night in Seattle, played for Santa Clara against Portland on Sunday,
then rejoined the U.S. team on Monday for a semifinal on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Such a schedule hardly helped Santa Clara, the U.S. or Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   The entire situation angered Cuellar, himself a college coach and
former World Cup player for Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not happy that some Mexican girls who have played for Mexico
before and belong to universities were not allowed to be with us," he
said. "And I ask myself if [they were U.S. players], would the
universities take the same position?</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great experience for any athlete to be in a World
Cup team, to be part of a qualifying tournament. My federation also
invests a good amount of money in developing those players. We
constantly fly them to Mexico in the [college] off-season. We prepare
them, we help them, and I think we should have a better understanding
from these universities.</TE>
<TE>   "Not to be political or controversial, but I think [U.S. schools]
have to understand that it's the opportunity of a lifetime to be part
of a World Cup team. They should understand that."</TE>
<TE>   Heinrichs, who coached at the University of Virginia before
becoming the U.S. women's coach, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "No coach should stand in the way of a player's career on the
national team," she said. "I'm a strong advocate that coaches should
be releasing players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're lucky to have national team players, whether we're a high
school coach or a college coach or a club coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in a real consistent philosophy, and that is: You
recruit the best players because you know they're going to help your
team get better, but don't stand in the way of their future."</TE>
<TE>   Pellerud said the only way national teams can get the upper hand
is to make sure their players are careful in selecting which college
to attend, avoiding schools that are uncooperative.</TE>
<TE>   Heinrichs suggested the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "It can hurt some colleges in recruiting if it gets out that their
athletic director or their coach is not supportive of their national
team players," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think at the end of the day, it's unfortunate that national
team players are getting put in the middle of that tug of war."</TE>
<TE>   Club-versus-country controversies have long been a thorn in
soccer's side.</TE>
<TE>   Now, college versus country is becoming another.</TE>

<HD>Alabama Hits Ground to Beat LSU and Its No. 1 Defense</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santonio Beard ran for 109 yards and two touchdowns as No. 10 Alabama
defeated No. 14 Louisiana State, 31-0, Saturday night at Baton Rouge,
La.</LD>
<LD>   In a game featuring two of the nation's top defenses, Alabama's
ground game was the difference. The Crimson Tide ran for 300 yards
and held the ball for 34 minutes 37 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   The Tigers were shut out for the first time since Alabama beat
them, 26-0, in 1996. It was LSU's most lopsided shutout loss since a
35-0 defeat to Oklahoma in the 1950 Sugar Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   Alabama, 9-2 overall and 6-1 in the conference, is banned from
bowl participation and can't win the SEC West Division. But the
Crimson Tide, which has won five consecutive games, put pressure on
LSU to return to the conference championship game. The Tigers must
win both of their remaining games to make the title game.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (7-3, 4-2) had the No. 1 overall defense in the nation,
giving up 246.4 yards a game. Alabama was No. 3, giving up 249.1.</TE>
<TE>   The game was scoreless until late in the second quarter, when
Beard capped a 64-yard drive with a six-yard touchdown run. The
extra-point kick went wide right, and Alabama led 6-0 with 3:52 left
in the half.</TE>
<TE>   The Tide's running game kicked in on their last drive of the half.
Alabama went 96 yards on nine plays -- all runs. Tyler Watts ran the
last two yards for the score with 12 seconds left. Tiarandos Luke ran
for the two-point conversion for a 14-0 halftime lead.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Florida 28, South Carolina 7 -- Rex Grossman completed 24
of 36 passes for 228 yards and four touchdowns to lift the Gators
(8-3, 6-2) at Gainesville, Fla. The Gators didn't have the game in
hand until Grossman connected with Kelvin Kight for a 27-yard
touchdown pass with 9:08 left. The score was set up by a 21-yard
reception by Grossman from receiver Keiwan Ratliff. South Carolina is
5-6, 3-5.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee 35, Mississippi State 17 -- Cedric Houston ran for a
career-high 149 yards and two touchdowns as Tennessee turned to its
ground game and defense to win at Starkville, Miss. James Banks made
his first start for Tennessee (6-4, 3-3) in place of quarterback
Casey Clausen, who was out because of an ankle injury, and completed
three of eight passes for 90 yards. Mississippi State (3-7, 0-6) lost
three fumbles and the Volunteers converted the turnovers into 21
points.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 41, Vanderbilt 21 -- Derek Abney set an NCAA record with
his sixth kick return for a touchdown and Artose Pinner ran for a
career-high 224 yards and four touchdowns to help Kentucky (7-4, 3-4)
win at Lexington, Ky. Pinner set a school record with his eighth
100-yard rushing game of the season. His four touchdown runs tied a
school record. Vanderbilt is 2-9, 0-7.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas 24, Louisiana Lafayette 17 -- Quarterback Matt Jones had
13 carries and ran for 129 yards, including a 62-yard touchdown, and
completed nine of 13 passes for 118 yards and two touchdowns and
Kenny Hamlin's interception in the final two minutes sealed the
victory for Arkansas (7-3) at Fayetteville, Ark. Louisiana Lafayette
is 3-8.</TE>

<HD>Insider Backing for Gore Is Tepid</HD>
<DH>Nearly half of the Democrats surveyed say he shouldn't run
again for president. Sen. Kerry and Vermont Gov. Dean find support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the Democratic Party regroups from the disappointing midterm
elections and begins searching for a presidential nominee, a Los
Angeles Times Poll shows that nearly half of party insiders believe
former Vice President Al Gore should sit out the 2004 race.</LD>
<LD>   The poll, which surveyed roughly three-quarters of the membership
of the Democratic National Committee, suggests that the contest is
wide open and that there is a hunger for change. While 35% of
respondents said Gore should run again, 48% said he should not and
17% were undecided.</LD>
<LD>   The poll turned up significant backing for Massachusetts Sen. John
F. Kerry and surprising support for Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.</LD>
<TE>   Missouri Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the Democrats' leader in the
House since 1989, did not fare as well as Kerry or a second national
newcomer, North Carolina Sen. John Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democrats' vice
presidential nominee in 2000, and California Gov. Gray Davis, leader
of the nation's most populous state, also were viewed with less
enthusiasm. Fresh off his tight reelection win, Davis was one of the
least popular of 10 possible candidates tested.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found great affection for former President Clinton --
viewed favorably by 96% of respondents -- but also a recognition of
his polarizing effect among voters at large. More than half of those
sampled said Clinton should restrict his campaigning on behalf of the
party's 2004 nominee to a few selected states.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing this month's midterm elections, 43% said the result -- a
Republican-led Congress -- would make it easier for Democrats to
regain the White House in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "If things go wrong, Republicans really have nobody else to
blame," said Ron Oliver, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party.
Three in 10 said the midterm results would make Democrats' task more
difficult, and the rest said the outcome would make no difference.</TE>
<TE>   The DNC consists of roughly 450 local and state party leaders who
make up the governing body of the national party.</TE>
<TE>   Although members' views do not reflect those of the public at
large, their opinions could have a significant effect on which
candidate emerges as the Democrat to face President Bush in his
expected reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   "The first primary is among the insiders. It's organizers, it's
fund-raisers, it's these players," said Charlie Cook, a nonpartisan
campaign analyst in Washington. "These are the people you need to
line up long before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
These are the people that form the nucleus of your campaign in each
of the 50 states."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, concluded Thursday, found no clear-cut favorite in
the prospective Democratic field. Asked who they would like to see as
the party's 2004 nominee, just about half the party leaders surveyed,
46%, had no preference. Gore's name was volunteered by 13% and
Kerry's by 10%.</TE>
<TE>   After they were read a list of 10 prospective candidates, 19% of
respondents named Gore as their favorite; 11% still had no
preference. Kerry was cited by 18%, Edwards by 13% and Gephardt by
10%. Six other possible candidates were in single digits, including
Lieberman at 4%.</TE>
<TE>Asked their second choice, 18% chose Kerry and a like number picked
Edwards; 12% chose Gore, 11% Dean, and 10% Gephardt. And 12% had no
second choice.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found considerable ambivalence about Gore, who won the
popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but lost the White
House. The former vice president, who last week launched a series of
high-profile appearances, said he will reveal his plans for 2004 by
the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Asked who they believed would be the strongest candidate against
Bush -- regardless of their personal preferences -- more than 25% of
respondents cited no one in particular. Just about two in 10 picked
Gore. Kerry was named by 16% and Edwards by 13%. No other candidate
polled in double digits.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking New Faces</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a party that's desperately seeking fresh faces,"
said Cook, referring to the relative strength of Kerry, Edwards and
Dean compared with Gephardt, Lieberman and Gore, all of whom have
experience on the national stage. "You'd think most people wouldn't
know Howard Dean if he kicked them in the shins."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, under the direction of Susan Pinkus, interviewed
312 of 388 selected DNC members. Those who ordinarily stay neutral
until the party's nomination is settled -- such as the party's
executive leadership -- as well as committee members living abroad
were not contacted for the survey. Interviews were conducted by
telephone Nov. 7 and 8 and Monday through Thursday. The margin of
sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Among those ready to support Gore, for now at least, was Mary
Botkin, a DNC member from Oregon. "I think he had the presidency
stolen from him and I think he deserves the opportunity to do it
again, to see if he can get it," Botkin said in a follow-up
interview. "The Supreme Court elected this president, not the people
of the country."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 53% blamed Gore's failure to capture the White House on
circumstances beyond his control, including the Florida election
recount and the 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively
awarded the state's electoral votes to Bush, which made him
president.</TE>
<TE>   Few Blame Gore</TE>
<TE>   Only about three in 10 blamed Gore's defeat on the weakness of his
campaign or his shortcomings as a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the support for the ex-vice president could best be
described as a sympathy vote. When asked why they backed Gore, the
main reason cited was "because he was cheated" of the presidency.
Other reasons frequently mentioned were his experience, his
understanding of issues and a sense that he shared the committee
member's values.</TE>
<TE>   That said, many thought Gore already has had his best shot at the
White House and that now the party needs to move on.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Johnson, who lives in Washington and served in the Clinton
administration, confessed to mixed feelings about Gore. While
sympathetic to the view that the former vice president "was robbed of
the presidency," Johnson said, "The opposition did such a tremendous
job of really tarnishing Gore, he may not be the best soldier to put
on the field. I have a lot of respect and admiration for him, but if
we're talking about winning, I think Kerry would be the one.... He
would come in with a clean slate."</TE>
<TE>   The Massachusetts senator has all but officially announced his
candidacy after months of traveling the country to lay the
groundwork.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why they backed Kerry, the most common response among his
supporters was his understanding of the issues. Also frequently
mentioned were his charisma, a sense that he shares his supporters'
values and a belief that he could beat Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' supporters most often cited his relatively recent arrival
on the national scene. Additionally, he too was considered be a
strong candidate with personal charisma, and one who shares the
values of North Carolinians.</TE>
<TE>   The Arkansas party's Oliver, for one, believes the Democratic
Party needs to look South to have a chance of beating Bush. "Our
candidate has to be capable of winning at least one or two Southern
states," the Edwards backer said. "Philosophically, there are some
differences down here ... and I think he has a better understanding
of that."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman essentially has been campaigning since the last
presidential election was settled. But he has said that he would not
run if Gore, who picked him as his running mate, decides to make
another try.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Lieberman should stick to that self-imposed pledge,
seven in 10 said he should keep his word, while 22% said Lieberman
should feel free to run regardless of what Gore decides.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman is arguably the most conservative candidate in the
Democratic field, and his poor showing among party insiders may be
explained by their leftward tilt. Slightly more than half the DNC
members surveyed -- 53% -- described themselves as either very or
somewhat liberal, compared with 45% who said they were
middle-of-the-road or conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lieberman was seen overall in a positive light, with 75% of
respondents viewing him favorably compared with 21% who viewed him
unfavorably. Most of the rest of the field was equally well regarded,
with the prospective candidates generally enjoying favorable ratings
in the 70% to mid-80% range.</TE>
<TE>   There were, however, three exceptions. Dean, who has been
aggressively stumping for months, was viewed favorably by 49%, but
nearly as many respondents -- 45% -- said they had not heard enough
about him to form an opinion.</TE>
<TE>Davis, who survived a rocky first term as California governor to win
reelection by a surprisingly narrow margin, was viewed favorably by
48% and unfavorably by 38%.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Postal, a national committee member from Colorado, was
troubled by Davis' aggressive fund-raising during his reelection
effort and was unimpressed by his handling of California's
electricity crisis. "He didn't resonate with me as quite the
inspirational leader we need to take us in a new direction," said
Postal, who is otherwise neutral in the presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has said he plans to run for president,
received an overwhelmingly negative response from party insiders.</TE>
<TE>   Just 16% had a positive impression, with 66% expressing negative
views of the African American activist. When asked whether there was
any one candidate they would refuse to support, three in 10 mentioned
Sharpton -- by far the greatest number of any prospective candidate.
Asked why, most said he was "too inflammatory." Other reasons given
were a lack of credibility as a candidate and a perceived failure to
reflect mainstream Democratic values.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to those sharply negative views, there was nearly
universal affection for Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 96% who viewed the former president favorably, nearly
eight in 10 viewed him very favorably.</TE>
<TE>But party insiders also recognized that Clinton is still a political
weapon best deployed selectively. Gore kept his distance from his
boss during the 2000 campaign, and a depate still rages within the
Democratic Party over the wisdom of that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first of the 2004 contests in Iowa and New Hampshire
are more than a year off, the race has effectively begun with
candidates recruiting staff members and preparing for a spate of
formal announcements expected to begin over the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, 36% of DNC members interviewed said Clinton should
be sent to campaign in any state he is willing to visit. But slightly
more than half -- 52% -- said Clinton should be dispatched only to a
few selected states where his support for the Democratic nominee is
most likely to outweigh any backlash. Only 5% said he should not
campaign at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I would send him to states where Democrats need to build up their
base vote, particularly the African American vote," said Sue Lovell,
a Democratic committee member from Texas. She suggested Clinton would
be best used selectively, given the way he also incites passion among
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "He motivates them in a way we don't want them motivated," Lovell
said. "We have to keep him out of those areas where people would be
motivated to go vote against anything they thought he was for."</TE>

<HD>Insider Backing for Gore Is Tepid</HD>
<DH>Nearly half of the Democrats surveyed say he shouldn't run again
for president. Sen. Kerry and Vermont Gov. Dean find support.</DH>

<LD>As the Democratic Party regroups from the disappointing midterm
elections and begins searching for a presidential nominee, a Los
Angeles Times Poll shows that nearly half of party insiders believe
former Vice President Al Gore should sit out the 2004 race.</LD>
<LD>   The poll, which surveyed roughly three-quarters of the membership
of the Democratic National Committee, suggests that the contest is
wide open and that there is a hunger for change. While 35% of
respondents said Gore should run again, 48% said he should not and
17% were undecided.</LD>
<LD>   The poll turned up significant backing for Massachusetts Sen. John
F. Kerry and surprising support for Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.</LD>
<TE>   Missouri Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, the Democrats' leader in the
House since 1989, did not fare as well as Kerry or a second national
newcomer, North Carolina Sen. John Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democrats' vice
presidential nominee in 2000, and California Gov. Gray Davis, leader
of the nation's most populous state, also were viewed with less
enthusiasm. Fresh off his tight reelection win, Davis was one of the
least popular of 10 possible candidates tested.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found great affection for former President Clinton
--viewed favorably by 96% of respondents -- but also a recognition of
his polarizing effect among voters at large. More than half of those
sampled said Clinton should restrict his campaigning on behalf of the
party's 2004 nominee to a few selected states.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing this month's midterm elections, 43% said the result -- a
Republican-led Congress -- would make it easier for Democrats to
regain the White House in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "If things go wrong, Republicans really have nobody else to
blame," said Ron Oliver, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party.
Three in 10 said the midterm results would make Democrats' task more
difficult, and the rest said the outcome would make no difference.</TE>
<TE>   The DNC consists of roughly 450 local and state party leaders who
make up the governing body of the national party.</TE>
<TE>   Although members' views do not reflect those of the public at
large, their opinions could have a significant effect on which
candidate emerges as the Democrat to face President Bush in his
expected reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   "The first primary is among the insiders. It's organizers, it's
fund-raisers, it's these players," said Charlie Cook, a nonpartisan
campaign analyst in Washington. "These are the people you need to
line up long before the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
These are the people that form the nucleus of your campaign in each
of the 50 states."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, concluded Thursday, found no clear-cut favorite in
the prospective Democratic field. Asked who they would like to see as
the party's 2004 nominee, just about half the party leaders surveyed,
46%, had no preference. Gore's name was volunteered by 13% and
Kerry's by 10%.</TE>
<TE>   After they were read a list of 10 prospective candidates, 19% of
respondents named Gore as their favorite; 11% still had no
preference. Kerry was cited by 18%, Edwards by 13% and Gephardt by
10%. Six other possible candidates were in single digits, including
Lieberman at 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Asked their second choice, 18% chose Kerry and a like number
picked Edwards; 12% chose Gore, 11% Dean and 10% Gephardt. And 12%
had no second choice.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found considerable ambivalence about Gore, who won the
popular vote in the 2000 presidential election but lost the White
House. The former vice president, who last week launched a series of
high-profile appearances, said he will reveal his plans for 2004 by
the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Asked who they believed would be the strongest candidate against
Bush -- regardless of their personal preferences -- more than 25% of
respondents cited no one in particular. Just about two in 10 picked
Gore. Kerry was named by 16% and Edwards by 13%. No other candidate
polled in double digits.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking New Faces</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a party that's desperately seeking fresh faces,"
said Cook, referring to the relative strength of Kerry, Edwards and
Dean compared with Gephardt, Lieberman and Gore, all of whom have
experience on the national stage. "You'd think most people wouldn't
know Howard Dean if he kicked them in the shins."</TE>
<TE>   The Times Poll, under the direction of Susan Pinkus, interviewed
312 of 388 selected DNC members. Those who ordinarily stay neutral
until the party's nomination is settled -- such as the party's
executive leadership -- as well as committee members living abroad
were not contacted for the survey. Interviews were conducted by
telephone Nov. 7 and 8 and Monday through Thursday. The margin of
sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Among those ready to support Gore, for now at least, was Mary
Botkin, a DNC member from Oregon. "I think he had the presidency
stolen from him and I think he deserves the opportunity to do it
again, to see if he can get it," Botkin said in a follow-up
interview. "The Supreme Court elected this president, not the people
of the country."</TE>
<TE>   In all, 53% blamed Gore's failure to capture the White House on
circumstances beyond his control, including the Florida election
recount and the 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision that effectively
awarded the state's electoral votes to Bush, which made him
president.</TE>
<TE>   Few Blame Gore</TE>
<TE>   Only about three in 10 blamed Gore's defeat on the weakness of his
campaign or his shortcomings as a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the support for the ex-vice president could best be
described as a sympathy vote. When asked why they backed Gore, the
main reason cited was "because he was cheated" of the presidency.
Other reasons frequently mentioned were his experience, his
understanding of issues and a sense that he shared the committee
member's values.</TE>
<TE>   That said, many thought Gore already has had his best shot at the
White House and that now the party needs to move on.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Johnson, who lives in Washington and served in the Clinton
administration, confessed to mixed feelings about Gore. While
sympathetic to the view that the former vice president "was robbed of
the presidency," Johnson said, "The opposition did such a tremendous
job of really tarnishing Gore, he may not be the best soldier to put
on the field. I have a lot of respect and admiration for him, but if
we're talking about winning, I think Kerry would be the one.... He
would come in with a clean slate."</TE>
<TE>   The Massachusetts senator has all but officially announced his
candidacy after months of traveling the country to lay the
groundwork.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why they backed Kerry, the most common response among his
supporters was his understanding of the issues. Also frequently
mentioned were his charisma, a sense that he shares his supporters'
values and a belief that he could beat Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards' supporters most often cited his relatively recent arrival
on the national scene. Additionally, he too was considered be a
strong candidate with personal charisma, and one who shares the
values of North Carolinians.</TE>
<TE>   The Arkansas party's Oliver, for one, believes the Democratic
Party needs to look South to have a chance of beating Bush. "Our
candidate has to be capable of winning at least one or two Southern
states," the Edwards backer said. "Philosophically, there are some
differences down here ... and I think he has a better understanding
of that."</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman essentially has been campaigning since the last
presidential election was settled. But he has said that he would not
run if Gore, who picked him as his running mate, decides to make
another try.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Lieberman should stick to that self-imposed pledge,
seven in 10 said he should keep his word, while 22% said Lieberman
should feel free to run regardless of what Gore decides.</TE>
<TE>   Lieberman is arguably the most conservative candidate in the
Democratic field, and his poor showing among party insiders may be
explained by their leftward tilt. Slightly more than half the DNC
members surveyed -- 53% -- described themselves as either very or
somewhat liberal, compared with 45% who said they were
middle-of-the-road or conservative.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Lieberman was seen overall in a positive light, with 75% of
respondents viewing him favorably compared with 21% who viewed him
unfavorably. Most of the rest of the field was equally well regarded,
with the prospective candidates generally enjoying favorable ratings
in the 70% to mid-80% range.</TE>
<TE>   There were, however, three exceptions. Dean, who has been
aggressively stumping for months, was viewed favorably by 49%, but
nearly as many respondents -- 45% -- said they had not heard enough
about him to form an opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who survived a rocky first term as California governor to
win reelection by a surprisingly narrow margin, was viewed favorably
by 48% and unfavorably by 38%.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Postal, a national committee member from Colorado, was
troubled by Davis' aggressive fund-raising during his reelection
effort and was unimpressed by his handling of California's
electricity crisis. "He didn't resonate with me as quite the
inspirational leader we need to take us in a new direction," said
Postal, who is otherwise neutral in the presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Al Sharpton, who has said he plans to run for president,
received an overwhelmingly negative response from party insiders.</TE>
<TE>   Just 16% had a positive impression, with 66% expressing negative
views of the African American activist. When asked whether there was
any one candidate they would refuse to support, three in 10 mentioned
Sharpton -- by far the greatest number of any prospective candidate.
Asked why, most said he was "too inflammatory." Other reasons given
were a lack of credibility as a candidate and a perceived failure to
reflect mainstream Democratic values.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to those sharply negative views, there was nearly
universal affection for Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 96% who viewed the former president favorably, nearly
eight in 10 viewed him very favorably.</TE>
<TE>   But party insiders also recognized that Clinton is still a
political weapon best deployed selectively. Gore kept his distance
from his boss during the 2000 campaign, and a debate still rages
within the Democratic Party over the wisdom of that decision.</TE>
<TE>   Although the first of the 2004 contests in Iowa and New Hampshire
are more than a year off, the race has effectively begun with
candidates recruiting staff members and preparing for a spate of
formal announcements expected to begin over the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Looking ahead, 36% of DNC members interviewed said Clinton should
be sent to campaign in any state he is willing to visit. But slightly
more than half -- 52% -- said Clinton should be dispatched only to a
few selected states where his support for the Democratic nominee is
most likely to outweigh any backlash. Only 5% said he should not
campaign at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I would send him to states where Democrats need to build up their
base vote, particularly the African American vote," said Sue Lovell,
a Democratic committee member from Texas. She suggested Clinton would
be best used selectively, given the way he also incites passion among
Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "He motivates them in a way we don't want them motivated," Lovell
said. "We have to keep him out of those areas where people would be
motivated to go vote against anything they thought he was for."</TE>
