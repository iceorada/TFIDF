<LD>Wearing a pink shirt and a dark suit, Peter Falk was standing in the
lobby of the Directors Guild of America in Los Angeles on Wednesday
night when someone approached him from behind. Falk, concentrating on
a thought, dismissively waved the person away without looking.</LD>
<LD>   "The industry has a number of very gifted directors,
extraordinarily gifted guys," he was saying. "But the truth is, there
are maybe only a few genuine original filmmakers."</LD>
<LD>   "Peter," the man insisted, prompting Falk to turn around.</LD>
<TE>   It was Wim Wenders, in a dark suit with white angel wings sewn
onto his lapels.</TE>
<TE>   "Wim!" Falk cried out, throwing his arms around the German
director. "I was just about to say, 'Only Wim would think of writing
a part where the guy wasn't an ex-husband or an ex-convict but an
ex-angel' "--the role Falk had played in Wenders' celebrated "Wings
of Desire."</TE>
<TE>   Reuniting star and director was the fifth Filmmakers Alliance
gala, at which Wenders received the Vision Award. The event fell on
his 57th birthday, and Wenders had just breezed in from a private
celebration, landing in the midst of an overflowing crowd.</TE>
<TE>   The evening of independent short films, open bar and free food
attracted so many guests that some had to be turned away. As hundreds
of people filed into two theaters, about a dozen were left with their
noses pressed against the glass doors outside.</TE>
<TE>   Accepting his award, Wenders joked that he was indebted to his
German optometrist for his vision, and, in an unusual gesture,
thanked not only his wife but also his personal assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Later, interrupting an introduction by FA president Jacques
Thelemaque, Wenders apologized profusely for having to leave, as he
had to go to his own surprise party.</TE>
<TE>   After the director left, Thelemaque noted dryly, "I guess that
frees up some seats for the people outside."</TE>
<TE>   Party Surprise</TE>
<TE>   Nicolas Cage and Lisa Marie Presley surprised everyone by showing
up unannounced at Moby's rooftop party Monday night at the Standard
Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. (The party was held to kick off of his
Area2 tour, which opened in Irvine on Tuesday.) Cage and Presley had
just returned from their secret Aug. 10 wedding in Hawaii and decided
to make Moby's gig their first public outing since the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   They cozied up on a couch next to the DJ to chat with friends,
creating a small firestorm in the entertainment media world. "When
they showed up, I turned to 'Access Hollywood' and said 'Merry
Christmas,' " said an event publicist. The couple wouldn't talk to
reporters, but the sighting and video footage of their appearance
landed a major scoop for Us Weekly and "Access Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the competition--People magazine, whose reporters opted
to skip the event, and "Entertainment Tonight," whose reporters
weren't invited--were left scrambling the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   And Moby's midnight performance? It was almost anticlimactic.</TE>
<TE>   'The Best Schmooze'</TE>
<TE>   The Carousel of Hope is to charity balls what the Vanity Fair
party is to post-Oscar bashes. It's such a hot ($2,000-per-couple)
ticket that this year's Oct. 15 event was sold out by June.
Headliners Sting and Elton John have been booked for more than a
year. Jay Leno is the emcee. "And Oprah's coming out from Chicago,
because she loves Sidney [Poitier] and she loves Halle [Berry]," said
the event's host Barbara Davis. (Berry will present Poitier with a
special award that was sculpted by artist Robert Graham.)</TE>
<TE>   "I called each person myself," said Davis. "That's how I sold it
....It's kind of the best schmooze there is." The charity ball is
considered the most profitable of its kind, raising more than $6
million for the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes every
other year. Davis, wife of billionaire oilman Marvin Davis and the
reigning queen of L.A. society, founded the event in her hometown of
Denver after her daughter Dana was diagnosed with the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my child and my life," she said. "It's not an 'event.' "
The ball moved with the Davises when they moved to L.A. in 1981 after
Marvin Davis bought Twentieth Century Fox. (He sold the studio to
Rupert Murdoch four years later.)</TE>
<TE>   One of the event highlights is the silent auction that's held so
people don't get bored, Davis said. There are the usual autographed
Laker jerseys, stunning jewels and a dinner party hosted by Wolfgang
Puck. Haim and Cheryl Saban are offering a glamorous auction item: a
five-night stay in their 12-bedroom, fully staffed "Villa Eden"
mansion in Acapulco. Bidding starts at $50,000.</TE>

<HD>Earth Mother, Yoga Star</HD>
<DH>Ex-hippie Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa is the teacher whom much of
prenatal Hollywood has come to trust</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hush falls over the room, and all eyes turn to the petite woman in
the white turban. On a small stage draped with red tapestries,
Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa kneels before the class of about 50 women, all in
different stages of pregnancy. Her expression is beatific as she
speaks gently into her microphone headset. "Pregnancy is so
pertinent, whether you're pregnant or not," she tells her students.
"It's about your own birth .... Everything becomes alive around
pregnancy."</LD>
<LD>   The scent of lilies hovers over the class, whose members--many of
them film producers, costume designers, hairstylists, models, actors
and filmmakers--sit cross-legged on yoga mats spread over the wood
floor.</LD>
<LD>   Gurmukh, as she is known, is Hollywood's favorite pregnancy guru.
While Angelenos are infamous for idolizing their yoga instructors,
this 60-year-old Kundalini yoga teacher has influence that has
expanded beyond mere infatuation. She draws people by the thousands
each month to her Golden Bridge yoga studio in Los Angeles, and she's
considered one of the nation's yoga superstars.</LD>
<TE>   Some of her appeal lies in her "mother knows best" approach to
pregnancy and birthing, which encourages women to think for
themselves rather than blindly follow the experts--herself included
(though she's influenced many of her students to attempt drug-free
labors and at-home births). There is a touch of glamour to her
flowing attire and metaphysical outlook, but Gurmukh up-close is
earthy and approachable, speaking often of her "hippie days." In
fact, it's her colorful past as a free-love flower child that
captivates the "been there, done that" Hollywood crowd.</TE>
<TE>   She also mines Hollywood's ubiquitous celebrity factor with a
roster of famous students--Madonna, Rosanna Arquette, Melissa
Etheridge. A blurb from Cindy Crawford on the back of Gurmukh's "The
Eight Human Talents" (HarperCollins, 2000) reads: "I'm forever in her
debt."</TE>
<TE>   And it doesn't hurt business when Gurmukh's name pops up in places
such as this month's W magazine, where Courtney Love, pulling up in a
limo at the Viper Room with teacher in tow, is quoted as saying:
"What she does is Kundalini yoga. It's better for me than Prozac."</TE>
<TE>   Some people say that Gurmukh's teachings on pregnancy and
motherhood can be extreme. (She suggests that vaccinations and car
seats are potentially harmful to infants, hospitals can be risky
places to give birth and doctors only "catch" the baby during
delivery.)</TE>
<TE>   Others consider her a calm presence in the swirl of instruction
available to pregnant women. "The best part about it is that you come
here and you're a goddess because you're pregnant," says Rebecca
Bitton, a 30-year-old former actress who is six months' pregnant with
her second child. "For an hour and a half, you don't feel like you're
in the chaos."</TE>
<TE>   During a recent class, Gurmukh's students are attentive but
relaxed, almost familial. Women laugh openly as their teacher
describes her years traveling the country in a hippie caravan of
school buses and working on an organic farm.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation turns, and a student explains her tardiness. She
was in a minor car accident. Gurmukh considers it a sign. "Maybe
after this, you shouldn't drive," she says. "One thing you don't want
to do is try to be on time all the time. It's better to go slow and
be late. That's why I never start this class on time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, 30 minutes pass before any yoga takes place. Gurmukh's
prenatal Kundalini classes often begin this way, with the teacher
imparting her beliefs and offering an intuitive spin on developments
in her students' lives. She asks after specific women and sometimes
offers a prayer for those nearing their due date or having
troublesome pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Then she leads a series of subtle movements that, when repeated
for several minutes, become tests of will. This is the essence of
Kundalini, movements paired with special breathing patterns,
meditation and chanting that, according to its teachings, balance the
energy centers of the body and harmonize a person physically,
emotionally and spiritually.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Gurmukh cheers them on. "Pull your baby's home up,"
she says instructing the women to lift their bellies as they sit
cross-legged on the floor, rotating their bodies from head to waist.
"Just let the body flow like an ocean wave! Feel your baby going for
a great ride!"</TE>
<TE>   Some women close their eyes and smile as they move, others keep
their eyes open, looking exhausted and frustrated. Gurmukh continues
her lesson, reminding her students that as pregnant women "we're the
strongest we've ever been."</TE>
<TE>   A camaraderie develops during the 90-minute classes, as students
are encouraged to cast off inhibitions. Francey Grace, a 34-year-old
film producer, found the class initially awkward and then liberating.
"There is a sort of vibe that is interesting," she says. "You've got,
like, 40 pregnant women in the room. Everyone's really content." The
cost: $15 a session.</TE>
<TE>   Gurmukh insists that her role is to educate, not to advocate any
one path. "I promote a woman to think for herself, to empower
herself, because this soul has chosen her and is depending on her to
know [what to do]," Gurmukh says. But she doesn't hide her opinions,
drawn from the Sikh religion and yoga, her guru and alternative
publications.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her students have opted not to vaccinate their babies or
circumcise their sons because Gurmukh has warned them that
vaccinations may be harmful to an infant and that circumcision is
purely aesthetic and optional. "Doctors aren't always right," she
says. "They're not God." After the birth, many of those mothers stay
home for 40 days because Gurmukh stresses the need to bond with their
child and allow themselves time to heal, a Sikh tradition.</TE>
<TE>   But frequently students use what they want and ignore the rest.
Grace tried to use the breathing and relaxation techniques she'd
learned from Gurmukh to avoid pain medication during labor, but after
the first five drug-free hours of a 15-hour labor, she opted for
pharmaceutical relief.</TE>
<TE>   As for the 40-day withdrawal after the birth, Grace confesses,
"Staying in the house for 40 days would not be something I would be
able to tolerate."</TE>
<TE>   Gurmukh's views on Western medicine (she finds many aspects
suspect) grew largely out of her own experiences as a pregnant
22-year-old. It was 1964, and she was then known as Mary Mae Gibson,
fresh off her parents' Illinois farm.</TE>
<TE>   "The hospital delivery was horrific," she says. "It was election
night in November, and the doctors were watching the TV behind their
backs as I was trying to deliver my baby ....They didn't pay
attention to me at all ....I was an afterthought." The child was born
with a congenital heart defect, and Gurmukh remembers bitterly that
even as she struggled to cope with the news of her son's condition,
doctors were insisting that she have him circumcised. The baby died
seven months later.</TE>
<TE>   After her son's death and a divorce from her first husband,
Gurmukh spent six years wandering from Haight-Ashbury to Maui and
Germany to Big Sur, where she lived in a tent and bartered for food
with walnuts she found in the woods. "Of course, LSD came into it,"
she says.</TE>
<TE>   At one point she was addicted to diet pills and admits to having
"excessive" numbers of sexual encounters. "I didn't have a tomorrow
in mind," she says. "I just knew I had to do something to help the
world."</TE>
<TE>   During a yoga workshop in Tucson in 1971, she met her guru, Yogi
Bhajan, a Sikh man credited with introducing Kundalini yoga to
America. He gave her the Sanskrit names Gurmukh, meaning "one who
takes thousands across the world ocean," Kaur meaning "princess" and
Khalsa meaning "pure ones.</TE>
<TE>   "You are to deliver babies," the guru told her. So she befriended
a Santa Fe, N.M., obstetrician and cleaned his house in exchange for
birthing lessons. After a trip to India, Gurmukh says, "it came to me
... that my destiny really wasn't to deliver the physical baby but to
deliver the mother."</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, she moved to Los Angeles to open the city's first
Kundalini yoga center. There she met her second husband, Gurushabad.
In 1984, they had a daughter at home, Wahe Guru, now 18.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood enters the biography in the early 1990s, when David
Duchovny "discovered" Gurmukh--who teaches a range of yoga classes
beyond the prenatal--bringing with him friends from the TV show "Twin
Peaks," including co-star Sherilyn Fenn.</TE>
<TE>   While some of her teachings are considered radical, she finds
support in the medical community. "Gurmukh is the real deal," says
Beverly Hills-based obstetrician Dr. Anthony Chin, who with his
associate Dr. Paul Crane, recommends her prenatal classes to
patients, particularly those interested in natural childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   The breathing and meditation she teaches are "absolutely
essential" for natural childbirth, said Dr. Chin. And less pain
medication means a quicker recovery, he says. Though both doctors are
"pro-vaccination," they believe Gurmukh's suggestions promote healthy
skepticism and encourage women to do important independent research.
"I think what she tries to teach is that there are a lot of reflex
things we do that don't necessarily need to be done," Chin says. He
sees her classes as a useful complement to birthing classes.</TE>
<TE>   All practical guidance aside, Gurmukh says her goal is to help
parents raise healthy, loving children so as to better our chances
for global peace. "The nine months in the womb and the first three
years of the child's life makes them who they are in life," she says.
If children learn compassion and kindness, "that could change
everything right there."</TE>

<LD>The 56-Star Flag</LD>
<LD>   In the spring of 1945, American soldiers were on their way to
Austria's Mauthausen Concentration Camp. Mauthausen was a camp in
which Jews and others were imprisoned in crowded, dirty conditions.
More than 120,000 people died there.</LD>
<LD>   Three of the prisoners wanted to welcome the soldiers with an
American flag. They presented a handmade flag to U.S. Army Col.
Richard Seibel on May 14, 1945. The prisoners wanted to thank him and
the soldiers for freeing them.</LD>
<TE>   To make the flag, the prisoners used a bedsheet from a German
laundry in the camp as the background. They used red fabric from a
Nazi banner found in the village of Mauthausen for the red stripes.
They used bluish-gray cloth from the prisoners' ragged jackets for
the blue on the flag and for the stars.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, there were only 48 stars on the American flag, but the
Mauthausen prisoners made 56 stars, as they were unsure of the
correct number. They sewed all the pieces of the flag together with a
hand-cranked sewing machine found in a camp workshop where German
soldiers' uniforms were made.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners of Mauthausen knew that the American flag stood for
hope, freedom and pride. Americans today feel that way too. Since
Sept. 11, American flags can be seen everywhere. The 56-star flag is
on display in the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance
Multimedia Learning Center Artifact Room. For more information, visit

<LD>Regional publishing has long been the quiet conscience of American
letters, and Minneapolis is one of its several unlikely centers.</LD>
<LD>   The city is home to three high-quality small literary
presses--Graywolf, Milkweed and Coffee House--and two strong academic
publishers, as well as the groundbreaking Loft Literary Center, the
nation's largest nonprofit organization devoted exclusively to
writing, reading and the book-making arts.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, the Loft's latest project may create a national presence
for the Minneapolis literary scene. Later this month, it will begin
nationwide distribution of Speakeasy, an ambitious new bimonthly
"literary culture magazine." The premiere issue, which goes on sale
Aug. 26, is a handsome, full-color production. And, clearly, the Loft
is not alone in its belief that the project may appeal to a
substantial audience, since the first is filled with advertisements
from across the commercial and literary publishing spectrum.</LD>
<TE>   The premiere issue's content is serious and quirky in interesting
ways. There is a series of thoughtful--if somewhat earnest--essays in
which writers ruminate on their place in the world. There is a
first-rate excerpt--"Serving the Moloch of Mediocrity"--from Nick
Tosches' forthcoming novel "In the Hand of Dante."</TE>
<TE>   Oxford University scholar and literary biographer Hermione Lee
assesses the impending republication of "On Being Ill," one of
Virginia Woolf's "most daring, strange and original essays." First
published by T.S. Eliot in the New Criterion in 1926, Woolf typeset a
new pamphlet edition of just 250 signed copies on handmade paper for
her own Hogarth Press in July 1930. It was rediscovered in the rare
book room of the Smith College Library by Jan Freeman, whose
one-woman Paris Press publishes just two books a year out of
Ashfield, Mass. Lee's analysis serves as the introduction to the new
critical edition of Woolf's essay that Paris will publish late in the
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "On Being Ill," Lee writes, "treats not only illness, but
language, religion, sympathy, solitude and reading. Close to its
surface are thoughts on madness, suicide, and the afterlife. For good
measure, it throws in dentists, American literature, electricity, an
organ grinder and a giant tortoise, the cinema, the coming ice age,
worms, snakes and mice, Chinese readers of Shakespeare, housemaids'
brooms swimming down the River Solent, and the entire story of the
third Marchioness of Waterford."</TE>
<TE>   Speakeasy's first issue also includes a full complement of crisply
written reviews of new novels and short fiction, including a wrap-up
of upcoming first novels by David L. Ulin, editor of "Writing Los
Angeles: A Literary Anthology," due out in October. Speakeasy's
editor, Bart Schneider, weighs in with a review of Jonathan Williams'
new collection of photographic portraits, "A Palpable Elysium:
Portraits of Genius and Solitude."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, Speakeasy's first issue is precisely what a quality
regional literary review ought to be--aesthetically idealistic,
socially conscious but undogmatic, parochially inflected but in no
way provincial.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider, who finds his first issue "a little stiffer than I'd
like," is nonetheless confident in its direction. "I wanted to see
how far across the whole territory of serious literature we could go,
and I think we've made a good start," he said. "When the Loft Center
hired me a year or so ago to do this, I began to think about how you
could create a niche that would satisfactorily accommodate both
writers and readers. Most magazines for writers tend to be too
nuts-and-bolts-y. They don't convey a broad sense of the place
occupied by writers and literature in the culture. Magazines for
readers, on the other hand, tend to be slick. Though many--like
Book--do a nice job, they tend to be personality driven--they've all
got John Updike on their covers and take a celebrity approach to
reading."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider said his notion that readers might be hungry for
something different took shape during the years he worked in one of
Minneapolis' "great independent bookstores, the Hungry Mind. I'd
watch people come in and spend all afternoon in the store. They'd
wander from one section to another and seldom hung around the
bestsellers. My thought was to help create a magazine that would be
like that experience of browsing a great bookstore."</TE>
<TE>   Schneider's sensibility also was honed by the 15 years he spent
editing the Hungry Mind Review--now published as Ruminator Review--an
innovative little magazine known for its novel approach to involving
writers with social issues.</TE>
<TE>   He was recruited by the Loft Center shortly after it moved into an
expansive new complex called Open Book in downtown Minneapolis.
There, the 2,500-member center offers classes for writers, brings in
writers from the country to mentor local colleagues and conducts an
active program of readings and discussions. The center also houses
the Minnesota Center for the Book Arts, which operates a gallery and
conducts workshops in fine hand-binding and letterpress printing. The
magazine national distribution will be aided by a partnership with
the for-profit Utne Reader, the leading compendium of writing from
the alternative press, which also is based in the Twin Cities.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider was first drawn to the Twin Cities by another of its
signature cultural institutions, regional theater. "I was initially a
playwright in San Francisco, where I was educated," he said, "and I
moved here to work with the Playwright Center, another nonprofit
here. Shortly thereafter, I realized I'd hit the wall at 31 and
wasn't made to live the theatrical life. I realized I was really a
literary person."</TE>
<TE>   That was in 1986, and, since then, Schneider has published two
novels--both set in San Francisco. The first, "Secret Love," uses the
Free Speech Movement as its backdrop, and the other, "Blue Bossa," is
loosely based on incidents in the life of jazz trumpeter Chet Baker
set against Patty Hearst's kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Like Speakeasy, it is ambitious writing made possible, in
Schneider's view, by Minneapolis' physical remove from the major
centers of literary commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's a little easier for us to maintain the ideal
literature," he mused, "because we're so far out of the loop."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Gina Nahai is the author of three novels, "Cry of the Peacock,"
"Moonlight on the Avenue of Faith" and "Sunday's Silence":</TE>
<TE>   "I'm at work on my next novel, though I don't yet have a title and
it's driving me nuts. This book is the story of an Iranian woman in
L.A., the single mother of an 8-year-old son who is going
progressively deaf.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a story about irreversible loss, the sort you can't
ever overcome no matter what you try. It also is about how she, the
mother, comes to terms with this loss for both of them.</TE>
<TE>   "And, because it is one of my novels, it's also about her
heritage. There is a custody fight, since the protagonist's own
mother is trying to take the son because she believes in dealing with
this tragedy differently. Part of the book is about the Old World
stories the boy's mother is telling her son before he goes completely
deaf. They are something she desperately wants him to have, wants him
to hear.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a good first draft, but it's hard to tell when I'll be
done. I always think I'll be done next week, and I'm never done. I
think it's going to be another year. But there is still the title.
Every time I come up with one and tell somebody, they say they hate
it, and there it goes. Every time I think of one before I go to
sleep, I wake up in the morning and hate it--and there it goes."</TE>

<LD>The Body Shop, the company that helped establish the idea of
promoting social causes along with skin-care products, is tweaking
the concept again. The 26-year-old company, founded by environmental
activist Anita Roddick in Britain, has revamped its entire cosmetics
line to deliver color along with a double benefit--one to moisturize
skin and the other to aid disadvantaged communities.</LD>
<LD>   The new bamboo-inspired packaging is the most obvious example of
the Body Shop's makeover. Makeup brushes that stand up on end and
mascara tubes look like spindly black bamboo stalks. The company
ditched the traditional weights and bearings in packaging that make
lipsticks feel substantial and purses heavy.</LD>
<LD>   All color cosmetics except the oil-free foundation now include
marula nut oil, a moisturizer derived from a tree found in southern
Africa. Through the company's community trade program, the oil is
purchased from a Namibia women's cooperative to boost the local
economy. Its ongoing community trade programs elsewhere help boost
demand for ingredients such as olive oil, cocoa butter, honey and
beeswax.</LD>
<TE>   The new "color with care" concept is the result of a company-wide
restructuring that began more than three years ago and that focuses
on the U.S. Stores will be remodeled using renewable resources such
as bamboo flooring and recycled wood fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   The color range of cosmetics has grown as well to include more
shades, including 25 foundations.</TE>
<TE>   Though the company has always combined serious social issues with
the playfulness of makeup and body care, it hasn't abandoned the fun
this time around. The collection encourages experimentation with five
"adapters" that change the character of shadows, lipsticks and face
powders with the addition or subtraction of shine and shimmer.</TE>
<TE>   By the holidays, the company will introduce cubes of sparkly eye
shadow that are a cross between a Rubik's Cube and a compact.</TE>
<TE>   Sparkly Shoes, Eyewear</TE>
<TE>   Though Judith Leiber, the master maker of the minaudiere bag, has
long been retired, her company is ever expanding.</TE>
<TE>   This fall the company will introduce its first collections of
footwear and eyewear, both with the signature sparkle of Leiber's
rhinestones.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 footwear styles include low-heeled pumps, boots, slingbacks
and simple strappy evening sandals in exotic leathers such as
alligator and lizard. With golden soles and some semi-precious stones
and pearls as accents, they command a high-end price--$350 to $8,000.
A small, family-operated factory near Florence, Italy, will
manufacture the shoes, a nod to Leiber's continuing commitment to
quality handwork. The luxurious bags are still made in the longtime
New York factory. Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly
Hills will carry the shoes.</TE>
<TE>   The eyewear, which includes sunglasses, readers and ophthalmic
frames, also sparkles with the signature rhinestones and hand-set
semiprecious stones and sells for $320 to $1,250 at Neiman's and
Maison d'Optique in Sherman Oaks and Optical Designs in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Line</TE>
<TE>   After centuries of royals' influence on the fashion of their
subjects, a royal is taking his sense of style directly to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   The fashion industry earned a boost in prestige this week when the
London Sunday Times reported that Prince Charles will launch a
clothing collection called Duchy Originals, the name of his organic
food firm. The company, which donates profits to charitable causes,
is also diversifying into garden furniture.</TE>
<TE>   A source in the story said the prince felt a "deep sense of
obligation" to help the country's faltering rural economy, so the
collection will be made by rural workshops with wool from British
sheep farms. Britain's livestock farmers have suffered significantly
because many herds have been destroyed to prevent the spread of
foot-and-mouth disease.</TE>
<TE>   The collection, which will consist of country-style tweed suits,
sweaters and scarves, is set to debut next year.</TE>

<HD>If Stretchy Becomes Baggy, Fabric Is Probably Guilty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeannine Stein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dear Fashion Police: I work at home and often spend all day sitting
at the computer. I've been wearing cotton pants with some Lycra in
them because that little bit of stretch is very comfortable. But
lately I've been noticing that when I get up the pants are stretched
out and very baggy around my hips and thighs. It's not very
flattering, and I feel self-conscious if I have to go out in public.
Any suggestions?</LD>
<LD>   --IT'S A STRETCH</LD>
<LD>   Dear It's: Pants with stretch are certainly a godsend to those who
like their clothes trendy and comfortable. Textile manufacturers are
able to add a bit of stretch to fabrics without making them look like
stretch pants of old--i.e. those unflattering polyester things.
Unfortunately, after a few wearings, and especially if you're sitting
for hours at a time, sometimes the fabric doesn't snap back to its
original shape, leaving that bagginess.</LD>
<TE>   The solution is to choose a fabric such as woven rayon, Tencel (a
kind of rayon), or a blend, which have fluidity and drape and hang in
such a way that they tend not to bag. Look for wide-leg styles that
will give you comfort.</TE>
<TE>   We found a few casual styles that should work for you. J. Jill has
Tencel Cottage Pants in a relaxed cut with a slightly low waistline
($79), rayon crepe cropped pants with an elastic and drawstring waist
($69), and ribbed Tencel trousers with full legs and an elastic back
waist ($65.99). All are at www.jjill.com, or call (800) 343-5700.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Bauer offers Tencel drawstring pants that are
wrinkle-resistant with an elastic and drawstring waist ($49.99, www
.eddiebauer.com, or call [800] 625-7935).</TE>
<TE>   At Coldwater Creek we found rayon pants in a small print that have
a side zip and elastic waist ($54, www.coldwatercreek.com, or call
[800] 510-2808).</TE>
<TE>   IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR AGAIN: Back to school, that is, that
time-honored tradition when parents everywhere brave malls, discount
warehouses and department stores looking for stylish, affordable
clothes for their children. It's been a while since we've done an
informal survey of how moms and dads are planning their shopping
strategies, so we thought we'd put some questions out there again:</TE>
<TE>   * Do you have a specific shopping strategy in terms of which
stores to hit and how much money to spend? Is it different from
previous years? If so, how and why?</TE>
<TE>   * Have you done research by going online, reading catalogs or
looking at ads to get a definite idea of the kinds of clothes you'll
be shopping for, or will you see what strikes your fancy when you're
in the stores?</TE>
<TE>   * Have you found the selection of back-to-school clothes
acceptable in terms of styles and cost? If not, what would you like
to see changed?</TE>
<TE>   * How much say do you let your children have in choosing their
school wardrobes?</TE>
<TE>   * How many of you pray that your child's school will opt for
uniforms so you won't have to face this taxing annual ritual?</TE>
<TE>   Along with your scintillating comments, please include your name,
the city in which you live and a phone number where we can reach you.
We'll let you know the results.</TE>
<TE>   FROM THE FASHION POLICE BLOTTER: Last week we offered some tips on
how to wash dark clothes to minimize fading; this week you gave us a
few more. One reader said that quilt soap, used for washing quilts,
also helps prevent clothes from fading. It can be found at quilt and
fabric shops.</TE>
<TE>   Another reader suggested re-dyeing faded black clothes in a
washing machine using black Rit dye and, of course, following the
product's instructions. She adds that after dyeing the items she runs
the empty machine on a wash cycle and adds soap and bleach to clean
it out. You should wear rubber gloves and old clothes while doing
this. Be aware that some l Laundromats forbid dyeing clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Two readers reported good results with Woolite Dark Laundry Fabric
Wash, a new product that claims to minimize fading.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to all who contributed ideas and comments.</TE>

<LD>"We have 700 pounds of ice, along with rock salt, packed inside the
truck," Mr. Burt said. "That will keep our ice cream bars frozen."</LD>
<LD>   Mr. Burt and Harry looked happy and gave everyone at the curb a
free treat.</LD>
<LD>   "Hooray!" Cheers went up. "Good luck! Good Humor."</LD>
<TE>   Mr. Burt and Harry named their product "Good Humor Bars." They
wanted their customers to feel good. And that's just what happened.</TE>
<TE>   The ice cream bars became very popular. When children heard the
sound of tinkling bells, they knew the truck was coming. They always
ran out to greet it. The Burts had so much business that they bought
another truck and still another. They had to hire new drivers.</TE>
<TE>   One afternoon Ruth and I were on the way home from school when we
saw a kitten stuck in a tree. It was too high for us to climb up and
get it.</TE>
<TE>   Just then we heard bells. An ice cream truck! The driver got out,
climbed the tree and rescued the kitten.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the business grew so popular that it stretched to cities
across America. Children everywhere welcomed the trucks and enjoyed
ice cream treats.</TE>
<TE>   The drivers always greeted customers happily. Sometimes they
rescued a cat stuck in a tree, and other times they stopped and
helped people who had been in a bicycle or car accident.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth and I are grown now, and we don't live in the same city
anymore. But we write letters and talk to each other long distance.
Often we remember the years of her family's secret experiment. Just
thinking about that time makes us feel happy and full of good cheer.</TE>
<TE>   This story, by Nancy Smiler Levinson, is based on the true account
of the history of the Good Humor ice cream bar, a chapter in a book
on the social history of ice cream, "We All Scream for Ice Cream!" by
Lee Wardlaw, HarperCollins 2000. Levinson's story will be on The
Times Web site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new five-part story begins
on Monday.</TE>

<HD>A Secular Life for St. Vibiana's</HD>
<DH>L.A.'s 126-year-old, abandoned cathedral lies at the heart
of an ambitious revitalization project</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>St. Vibiana's sits at the corner of 2nd and Main streets like an old
dowager who's given up on appearances. Chunks of fallen plaster
expose the brick underneath. Paint peels in great curls, and where
magnificent stained-glass windows once hung, gaping holes are messily
covered with plywood and plastic.</LD>
<LD>   Its surrounding buildings are in varied degrees of disrepair. The
cupola from the abandoned cathedral's bell tower rests on its side in
a corner of the parking lot next to a stone cross; a stuffed toy lies
abandoned in the courtyard.</LD>
<LD>   But the former cathedral's 126-year-old bones are still good, and
the history it is steeped in so powerful that the structure is
getting a second chance at life, not as a church, but as the center
of a multipurpose project. Its developers hope the complex will again
be a heartbeat for the city.</LD>
<TE>   The cathedral is to be converted into a performing-arts center,
with Cal State L.A. as its main tenant; the nonprofit St. Vibiana's
Arts Project, which secured funding for the renovation, will help
steer its future. The multistory school building behind it will be
torn down to make way for a new Little Tokyo branch library. The old
rectory, built in 1933, will remain, possibly becoming space for
continuing-education classes for Cal State--although much work would
be needed to turn its tiny rooms into classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   A restaurant may be built on some of the garden space adjoining
the rectory. On the other side of the church, toward 3rd Street,
there would be new housing and parking structures.</TE>
<TE>   It is a dramatic turn of fortunes for St. Vibiana's. After being
heavily damaged in the 1994 Northridge quake, it came perilously
close to being demolished two years later by the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which had made the decision to build a
new cathedral on the site. Eventually, the archdiocese chose a site
eight blocks away; St. Vibiana's successor, the Cathedral of Our Lady
of the Angels, is set to open next month.</TE>
<TE>   Though the old church has been gutted of pews and lighting
fixtures, such treasures as colorful decorative painting, mosaics and
tiles remain. The marble altar needs polishing but remains
impressive, even in the dim light punctuated by slivers of sunshine
that shoot through the boarded-up windows.</TE>
<TE>   L.A.-based developer Tom Gilmore of Gilmore Associates, who has
orchestrated a number of downtown renovation projects, bought the
property in 1999 and has been formulating plans for it. He says work
will begin this fall on the $5.5-million renovation of the church,
including seismic repairs and restoring the cupola, using money from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, other federal sources and
state funds.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore estimates the cost of the rest of his proposed development
at $38 million: $30 million for construction of new housing and
parking space, and $8 million for the rectory renovation and
restaurant. Gilmore says he'll be "hunting around for funding" for
those projects in the next six to 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment of Block</TE>
<TE>   Could Spur Renaissance</TE>
<TE>   The redevelopment of the block--bordered by 2nd, 3rd, Main and Los
Angeles streets--is among several projects in the immediate area
that, taken together, are seen as fueling a renaissance for a skid
row-adjacent area that has languished for years.</TE>
<TE>   Facing St. Vibiana's across 2nd Street is the new California
Department of Transportation building, designed by the Santa
Monica-based firm Morphosis and under construction; facing it across
Main Street is the 10-story Higgins Building, a 91-year-old office
building vacant since the late 1970s that's being converted into
lofts.</TE>
<TE>   After completion of the Caltrans building, the old
site--kittycorner from St. Vibiana's--is being considered for
conversion into a large public plaza to be called Civic Square.</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors in the vicinity include the Los Angeles Music
Center, Frank Gehry's new Walt Disney Concert Hall, the newly
renovated City Hall, the Museum of Contemporary Art's Geffen
Contemporary and the proposed site of the new Los Angeles Children's
Museum. And just recently the Los Angeles Unified School District
approved plans to build a visual and performing-arts high school at
450 N. Grand Ave., the former site of LAUSD headquarters. The school,
which is to include a theater, rehearsal rooms and dance studios, is
scheduled to open in September 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore, who paid $4.6 million for the church and the block it
sits on, is hopeful that St. Vibiana's will regain the spirit it had
when its doors opened in 1876. "It was the center of where everybody
met in L.A., and now it will be that in a whole different way," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore, a former altar boy who is no longer affiliated with the
church, says spirituality had nothing to do with this purchase. The
downtown-centric developer, whose other properties include the
91-year-old Palace Theatre at Broadway and 6th Street, liked the idea
of having another viable area around the Old Bank District along
Spring and Main streets, where he has turned several old buildings
into residential lofts.</TE>
<TE>   But he makes it clear that St. Vibiana's is more than just another
architectural conquest.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm most proud of it out of everything we're doing," he says. "In
its day, St. Vibiana's was the heart, the absolute epicenter of the
city, and that the city could possibly be new again without first
addressing the heart of it doesn't make sense to me. There's a
certain poetry to renewing this. It's very special."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore says St. Vibiana's multiuse approach "speaks to our whole
philosophy on how to revitalize cities. Part of it is education, part
of it is culture, part of it is entertainment, and most of it is
housing. This plan really speaks to all of that, without it being too
much of a buffet in terms of urban planning." Still, he concedes that
the affordable and market-rate housing that are part of the plan
won't be family-friendly in the beginning. Their appeal will likely
be stronger for urban pioneers--singles and childless couples.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the first five to 10 years are really about young
people," he says. "But ultimately, as they begin to age and the city
matures, then you'll find things like schools, day-care centers,
parks and all the things that feed family life. I hope we're making a
little bit of a dent with this project, and I think the rest will
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore says he always thought the cathedral would be best suited
for the arts, even after he reviewed proposals that included turning
the quake-damaged building into an interfaith chapel, an ethnic
museum, housing for seniors or a hotel banquet hall.</TE>
<TE>   Attending arts performances is "how people gather," he explains.
"Depending on how you look at religion, the cathedral was always a
performing arts center. All I'm doing is making it secular."</TE>
<TE>   When people first gathered at St. Vibiana's, it was to pray.</TE>
<TE>   The building was constructed at a cost of $80,000 on land that had
been donated by city patron Amiel Cavallier. The Spanish
baroque-style cathedral designed by architect Ezra Kysor took 17
years from project approval to completion, and when it was finished
it became a focal point for Angelenos in the 19th century. Pope Pius
IX named the church after a little-known 3rd century martyr; relics
of the saint interred at St. Vibiana's have been moved to the new
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the cathedral wasn't immune even then from physical changes or
the whims of various church officials. Almost 20 years after it was
built, its interior was augmented with Mexican onyx and Italian
Carrara marble, frosted lighting fixtures and a stained-glass window.</TE>
<TE>   Two bishops, one in 1907 and another in 1922, attempted to build
new churches, leaving St. Vibiana's future in doubt. Neither project
got off the ground, but the cathedral did get a face lift in 1924,
changing the exterior to a more Roman design, which remains today.</TE>
<TE>   A school was added in 1940, but closed in 1960. And as downtown
L.A. began to lose its vibrancy, so did St. Vibiana's. Daily Masses,
Sunday services and other events continued at the cathedral but
parishioners began to taper off as the population spread to other
parts of the city and the suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it remained an important part of the Catholic community;
Pope John Paul II stayed there in 1987, and President Bill Clinton
visited in 1995. The rectory was home to Bishop Timothy Manning and
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Kevin Kostelnik lived at St. Vibiana's from 1989 to 2001 and
considered it "a nice oasis for people when the area was somewhat of
a wasteland. It was amazing in the midst of the city to go into the
cathedral and pray, and hear the noise outside, and this was a
reminder of a peaceful calm that you couldn't always find in the
streets."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kostelnik, now at the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels, says the old church "wasn't a really active place," daily
Masses drew local businesspeople, and Sunday Masses attracted a few
hundred downtown residents and others who were dedicated to St.
Vibiana's. About five priests and eight nuns lived on the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   After the earthquake, the cathedral's fate hinged on a highly
publicized tug of war between the archdiocese, which wanted to reduce
the building to rubble to build a new one for about $50 million on
the site, and preservationists who wanted to save the old building.</TE>
<TE>   The Cathedral Gets</TE>
<TE>   an 11th-Hour Reprieve</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Conservancy went nose to nose for years with the
archdiocese and the city, filing lawsuits and challenging decisions
designed to hasten the cathedral's demise. One of the more dramatic
moments in the fight came in 1996 when a crane hired by the
archdiocese pulled the cross and cupola from the bell tower. In an
11th-hour stay, a city building inspector ruled that the proper
permits weren't in place, halting the demolition.</TE>
<TE>   The conservancy eventually won its suits. The archdiocese chose
another downtown location just off the Hollywood Freeway for its new
cathedral, spending $10.85 million for the land and about $200
million more for the building. Where St. Vibiana held 1,200 people,
the new cathedral can seat 3,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming year, transformation of the St. Vibiana's block will
begin. The final phase, expected to start in about a year, will be
construction of the parking structures and apartment buildings, which
will feature 300 loft-like units; an architect for that part of the
project has not been named. Work on the library and renovation of the
cathedral and rectory get underway this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The 12,500-square-foot public library branch will replace a much
smaller one a few blocks away in Little Tokyo. The one-story
building, designed by Los Angeles architect Tony Lumsden, makes use
of available light via windows and skylights and includes interior
gardens. The design references Frank Lloyd Wright, Rudolf Schindler
and Japanese architecture, with an interior that focuses on "volume,
light and views of the garden," according to Lumsden. The city, which
bought that part of the property from Gilmore, is building the
library.</TE>
<TE>   Renovation of the cathedral will be managed by architect Brenda
Levin of L.A.-based Levin &amp; Associates Architects, best known for her
restoration work on such landmarks as Los Angeles City Hall and the
Bradbury Building. Levin says she relishes the challenge of bestowing
a different identity onto St. Vibiana's.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to recognize the structure but then be transformed by
what occurs in there," she says. "You don't want to have a religious
experience--well, you might want to--but you're not trying to evoke
the same mystery that a spiritual place like a cathedral is trying
to."</TE>
<TE>   Seismic, Other Repairs</TE>
<TE>   to Halt Further Damage</TE>
<TE>   Seismic repairs and other work will bring the building up to code
and forestall further damage. The repairs include returning the
cupola to its home, using reinforced concrete on a new foundation to
strengthen the tower, repairing and replacing various roofs with
plywood, metal and trusses to help stabilize the building, and
patching plaster on walls. The decision on whether to replace the
bell--which was moved to the new cathedral--remains up in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the building, in addition to the altar, some confessionals
have been left behind. "I'm thinking how to reuse those," says Levin
of the confessionals, "in terms of what kinds of opportunities actors
might have. I think our position is to sort of leave the church very
much intact. It's a pretty good space as it is. After we clean it up
and restore it, we have to deal with urban design issues, such as how
to enter the building, how to incorporate the exterior areas, and
then plan to accommodate very flexible use."</TE>
<TE>   Levin adds that a team of electrical and other technical
consultants, including specialists in theater design and acoustics,
is in place to start planning those parts of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State L.A. will occupy the cathedral about 150 days of the
year, according to Gilmore, with other groups performing between its
productions (in June the Cornerstone Theatre Company performed
"Crossings," updated Bible stories about Catholic immigrants'
journeys to Southern California, in various parts of the complex).
Cal State's arts students had performed at St. Vibiana's
pre-earthquake, as well as at other off-campus venues, but this will
be its first permanent off-campus site to be used for recitals and
lectures, theatrical, dance and musical performances, some done as
collaborations with other groups.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore says he envisions the performances at St. Vibiana's as
"everybody's performances. We're not going to charge $60 a seat, but
$6."</TE>
<TE>   Carl Selkin, dean of Cal State L.A.'s College of Arts and Letters,
says St. Vibiana's will be "a wonderful component that's part of
assembling a critical mass of cultural facilities and programs in
downtown, including Disney Hall. There's an attraction to the
building for so many people whose lives have been centered around
it."</TE>
<TE>   Despite being gutted of fixtures and in need of extensive work,
Selkin calls the space "wonderful" and adds, "Theater is historically
tied into sacred spaces, developed out of rituals that had spiritual
significance. It brought communities together, and I think this
continues that tradition. It's still a spiritual place."</TE>

<HD>Late-Night Talk Shows Ponder Sept. 11 Tone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL BROWNFIELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As television's news programs plan for their Sept. 11 anniversary
programming with specials offering somber reflection and spiritual
uplift, the late-night personalities who swim in the daily faux pas
and comic excesses of news and entertainment have a less clear
mandate.</LD>
<LD>   So NBC's "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" and "Late Night With
Conan O'Brien" will go ahead with original shows on Sept. 11, while
David Letterman, currently on vacation, is mulling what, if anything,
to do that night. Comedy Central's "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,"
meanwhile, which needs free and unfettered access to news parody,
will do normal shows on Sept. 9, 10 and 12 but not on Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "Late Night" executive producer Jeff Ross said of his New
York-based program's plans: "We're not sure what we're doing yet. We
obviously have to address the day."</LD>
<TE>   Ross said doing a show on Sept. 11 was discussed but not hotly
debated internally. "It wasn't anything more than it came up. I
called the network, [and] they said they expect us to do a show."</TE>
<TE>   NBC officials were unavailable to discuss the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge facing the comedians is not simply how to properly
mark the day but also how to fit in with the programs that will
precede their shows that night. The broadcast networks are assembling
prime-time news specials designed to be in line with the expected
mood of the day (news specials, including Fox's "The Day America
Changed," and an all-star concert on NBC).</TE>
<TE>   But what do you do on a late-night talk show, particularly a
comedy-focused program, on a day when television is expected to
provide saturation coverage of a nightmare that's still fresh in
viewers' minds?</TE>
<TE>   CBS approached Letterman about doing a show. When he balked, CBS
suggested a re-airing of his emotional broadcast on Sept. 18, a week
after the attacks, when "CBS Evening News" anchor Dan Rather choked
up. At the time, Letterman, the first of the late-night hosts to
return, was credited with laying the foundation for his competitors,
all of whom followed suit with their own heartfelt "the show must go
on" preambles.</TE>
<TE>   Letterman indicated that he neither wanted to do an original show
nor rerun the Sept. 18 broadcast, evidently concerned that he would
appear to be grandstanding. On Thursday, however, word came that
Letterman is still considering doing a show on Sept. 11, though no
one from "Late Show With David Letterman," which is on hiatus, would
comment. Letterman's decision would presumably also determine whether
CBS' 12:35 a.m. "The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn," which is
produced by Letterman's Worldwide Pants production company, works
that day.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, whatever plans or concerns "The Tonight Show" has are
unclear; no one from the show was available for comment. "The Tonight
Show" used Arizona Sen. John McCain as its first post-Sept. 11 guest
("We will prevail. We will prevail," McCain proclaimed), and the show
plans once again to turn to McCain as its unofficial crisis
counselor. Leno, it is presumed, will do a monologue, though it is
difficult to imagine a more awkward context for his mild populist
gibes at the day's headlines.</TE>
<TE>   "Saturday Night Live" doesn't have its season premiere until Oct.
5.</TE>
<TE>   "All I know right now is that we're dreading the reliving of the
feelings, dreading the anniversary, dreading having to work in a
comedy-producing environment in that context again," said Madeleine
Smithberg, "The Daily Show's" executive producer. The show's staff
returns from a two-week vacation Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The Comedy Central series' slings and arrows at broadcast news
pomposity have earned it critical and popular acclaim. Smithberg
noted that "The Daily Show" faces a greater challenge than the
late-night talk shows, given that so much of "The Daily Show" is
predicated on lampooning the news.</TE>
<TE>   "Your role as a human being supercedes your role as a satirist,"
she said. (The sentiment was echoed a year ago by "Daily Show" host
Jon Stewart, who, in an earnest post-Sept. 11 on-air speech, said:
"There were no jobs available for a man in the fetal position under
his desk crying, which I would have gladly taken. So I came back
here.")</TE>
<TE>   In the show's 11 p.m. time slot, Comedy Central will rerun a
"Daily Show" special featuring its correspondents.</TE>
<TE>   Booking guests for Sept. 11 presents its own set of challenges.
"We have been--'besieged' is the wrong word--inundated would be more
accurate, by media requests from both print and TV to be a part of
their Sept. 11 coverage," said Stan Rosenfield, publicist for such
name actors as Will Smith, Robert De Niro and George Clooney.</TE>
<TE>   "Our clients just have kind of told me individually, and this is
also my feeling ... , we don't care to be a part of it. This is about
media coverage and not about the event."</TE>
<TE>   "The Daily Show's" Smithberg agrees."We're going to be reliving it
in such a way that newspapers can sell newspapers and networks can
get ratings," Smithberg said. "The overall effect is that you become
numb to something you should never become numb to."</TE>

<LD>The good news: A full house of 87 listeners heard the New Hollywood
String Quartet on Wednesday night at the small theater called Inside
the Ford at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre. The bad: The event had
been moved indoors, 24 hours before, due to modest ticket sales.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, this turned out to be a most happy enterprise, since it
offered solid and admirable evidence of the ensemble's burgeoning
skills and artistry over its 20-month existence, and, this time
around, two new works written especially for the quartet by composers
from the film community. The new pieces, both in world premieres,
were Don Davis' moody, engrossing "Wandering" and Randy Kerber's
melodramatic Fantasy on Themes from "North by Northwest."</LD>
<LD>   The New Hollywood--violinists Clayton Haslop and Rafael Rishik,
violist David Walther and cellist Paul Cohen--remains a taut,
aggressive, highly accomplished musical body, with a wide dynamic
range and abundant versatility. That versatility was put to
profitable use in this program, which began with a put-together
quartet by Mendelssohn and closed with the Quartet in F by Ravel.</LD>
<TE>   The two movements of Mendelssohn's unfinished Opus 81, with an
earlier Capriccio, made a handsome, winsomely played opener that
displayed the players' deep sense of ensemble and their command of
structure and nuance. The familiar Ravel piece proved a model
combination of sweep and detail.</TE>
<TE>   Kerber wrote the scores for "The Matrix" and "Jurassic Park III."
But he used music by Bernard Hermann for the Hitchcock film "North by
Northwest" as the basis for his pumped-up Fantasy, which seems to
follow an unstated scenario through its gripping, 13-minute length.
Entirely tonal, it holds the listener through musical gestures both
violent and tender.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing tentative or haphazard in Davis' "Wandering," but
there are haunting qualities of yearning and melancholy through its
three continuous movements. The composer, orchestrator for James
Horner and Randy Newman, calls this, his second string quartet, an
"essay in introspection." It is highly compelling.</TE>

<HD>Jazz Station Trumpets Its New Name</HD>
<DH>Nothing else is expected to change as KLON-FM adopts the
moniker KKJZ. 'We're making it easier for people to find us,' general
manager says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask Prince, or the Soviets, or the fan of any radio station that has
flipped formats: A name change usually heralds even greater upheaval.</LD>
<LD>   But at public station KLON-FM (88.1), the name shift a week ago to
KKJZ merely reinforced what it's been playing since 1981: jazz.</LD>
<LD>   "Any time there's change, people worry. They shouldn't be afraid,"
said Judy Jankowski, general manager at KKJZ, which is owned and
operated by California State University, Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   "Now we get instant recognition. Southern California has a
full-time jazz station, and most cities don't," she said. "We're
making it easier for people to find us."</TE>
<TE>   KLON went on the air in 1951 as a service of the Long Beach
Unified School District, with the call letters denoting its city of
origin, Jankowski said. Thirty years later, the university took over
the license and immediately started playing jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "We have always wanted to have 'jazz' in our call letters, but the
call letters have to be available," said Jankowski, general manager
for eight years. The right letter combinations were always in use or
only available for a steep price. "We're a public radio station. We
don't have that kind of money."</TE>
<TE>   Then in February, KKJZ, a smooth jazz station in Portland, Ore.,
changed its format to "lite rock" and its call letters to KLTH.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's grab 'em," Jankowski said, and she made the pitch to the
station's board of directors and Cal State Long Beach administrators.
After their approval and a petition to the Federal Communications
Commission, the change was made.</TE>
<TE>   "Now if anybody comes to L.A., they're going to see KKJZ and know
what we play. I think it shows our commitment to this wonderful art
form," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say the change makes sense, identifying the station's
unique format rather than where the signal happens to originate.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the name K-Jazz. It tells the whole story," said Willard
H. Murray Jr., a retired state assemblyman from Paramount who, during
his tenure, worked to create the California Institute for the
Preservation of Jazz, based not coincidentally at Cal State Long
Beach because of the station's presence and the school's jazz
education program.</TE>
<TE>   The institute was formed in 1994 to "preserve and promote the
great American cultural heritage and social history of jazz music."
But Murray is concerned that the decline of jazz clubs, lack of music
education in schools and dearth of other outlets for Louis Armstrong,
Diana Krall and others will push jazz to the margins.</TE>
<TE>   "I look around and I don't see anybody under 40" at jazz concerts,
Murray said. "They don't attract what these other genres do. People
fill up stadiums who I've never heard of.</TE>
<TE>   "I would equate it to opera and classical music. It represents a
high level of creativity and performance," Murray said. "And jazz,
especially, is an American art form. That's why it's worth
preserving. It's historically significant."</TE>
<TE>   Although she too bemoans the lack of outlets for the music,
Jankowski is optimistic about the future of jazz and of K-Jazz. When
she joined the station, its audience averaged 45 to 55 years old. Now
the typical listener is a 39-year-old male. "Boy, isn't that a nice
demographic?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   KLON spent 20 years making itself a brand name for lovers of jazz,
with programming that includes Latin and lounge, bebop and blues,
swing and straight-ahead, and with sponsorship of such events as Jazz
at the Bowl, twilight dance concerts on the Santa Monica Pier, and
the Long Beach Blues Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great jazz station," said John Sutton, a 35-year radio
veteran and contributor to All About Jazz, a print and online
magazine. "They certainly know the music."</TE>
<TE>   Led by Chuck Niles, who anchors middays Wednesday through Sunday
and whose 45 years in radio netted him a star on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame, the station's lineup features DJs intimate with the music,
whether by playing it, studying it or living its history.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to know about [Thelonious] Monk and 'Trane [John
Coltrane] and Dixieland and blues and Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood, which
is the new stuff. You really have to be immersed in the music,"
Sutton said, and not simply read from a press release the record
company sends with the disc.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with the track record KLON established with fans, the
name change probably won't thrill them, Sutton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Your jazz audience is akin to the classical audience--the call
letters could be about anything. If they like the station, they'll
identify with it," said Sutton, who coincidentally worked at a Denver
jazz station called KKJZ in the early '80s.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the new letters will help attract anyone not
already familiar with KLON, Sutton said. "They say to you, 'This is
the jazz station.' "</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a decision we made lightly," Jankowski said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly proud to be in Long Beach," she added, but the
benefits of the new name outweigh the 50-year tradition of the KLON
moniker, "especially when we talk about serving the world."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to broadcasting to Southern California, KKJZ streams
its signal on the Internet, is available nationwide via cable and
satellite, is heard overseas on Armed Forces Radio, and is the only
public radio station carried in Japan on DirecTV, all of which,
Jankowski asserts, makes KKJZ "the most listened-to jazz station in
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, though, folks need to adjust to the change.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all slipping up. It's kind of fun, and we apologize to our
listeners," Jankowski said. "At a board of directors meeting
yesterday, one or two times I called ourselves KLON, and they all
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be some transition," she added, with a van to be
painted and signs to change. "We have a whole bunch of old stationery
to use up, because we're public radio."</TE>

<HD>Patched-Up Ancient Greek Play Finally Lands on Modern Stage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THEODORA TONGAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ANCIENT EPIDAURUS, Greece</DL>
<LD>As plays go, it took a long time for "Hypsipyle" to make the modern
stage--some 2,000 years.</LD>
<LD>   The work by Euripides, one of ancient Greece's most famous
playwrights, was lost until fragments of the text resurfaced in a
pile of Egyptian garbage last century.</LD>
<LD>   This summer, spectators will finally be able to see a
reconstruction of a play whose reputation filtered through the
centuries. It will be showing in this ancient theater, 109 miles
southwest of Athens, and in three other cities around Greece through
Aug. 26.</LD>
<TE>   Euripides wrote more than 90 plays before his death in 406 BC,
including "Medea," "Electra" and "Trojan Women." But less than two
dozen survive in full.</TE>
<TE>   "Hypsipyle" falls into the category of an ironic drama. First
performed around 408 BC, it tells the myth of an exiled queen who is
sold into slavery after secretly sparing her father, who was to be
killed along with all the other men on the Greek island of Lemnos.
The island's women murdered their men because they abandoned them
following a curse by the goddess Aphrodite.</TE>
<TE>   As the play opens, Hypsipyle, now a nursemaid on mainland Greece,
tells her tale to the baby she cradles in her arms--the son of the
king to whom she was sold. During the play, she inadvertently causes
the infant's death and has to deal with the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   That opening narrative is not only a classic Euripidean device,
but it is also one of the few complete pieces of "Hypsipyle" that
have been discovered.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not saved in its entirety but in many fragments, a variety
that runs the whole length of the work," according to reconstructor
and translator Tassos Roussos.</TE>
<TE>   Pieces of "Hypsipyle" were discovered in 1906 among 100,000 pieces
of papyrus found at an ancient garbage dump excavated at Oxyrhynchus,
99 miles southwest of Cairo, according to professor Peter Parsons,
director of Oxford's Oxyrhynchus Papyri project.</TE>
<TE>   While the original text is currently housed at Oxford's Bodleian
Library, the fragments were published in 1908 and became a source of
different scholarly views, said Roussos, who has translated nearly
all of Euripides' work.</TE>
<TE>   Of the original 1,600-odd lines, 400 complete lines and "a lot of
fragments" were discovered, Parsons said.</TE>
<TE>   Roussos said that left him with "the risk of trying to fill the
gaps." Although the plot of "Hypsipyle" is known from mythology, that
is not enough. He based his reconstruction on ancient sources,
decades-old studies, scholars' opinions and his own experience.</TE>

<HD>Risky Solo Flights Elevate Marcus Printup Quintet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trumpeter Marcus Printup was one of the late arrivals in the group of
young jazz lions who came roaring onto the public stage in the late
'80s and '90s. Like many of his compatriots, he was inspired and
aided by Wynton Marsalis.</LD>
<LD>   But Printup's roots reach far deeper into jazz history, drawing
sustenance from the hard bop style in general and the trumpet playing
of Freddie Hubbard in particular.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, the opening set by
Printup's quintet focused primarily upon providing musical frameworks
to display his wide-open soloing, as well as the adventurous efforts
of tenor saxophonist Walter Blanding Jr. and pianist Eric Lewis. A
few of the pieces offered a bit more than starting points for
improvisation: Printup's "The Bullet Train," with its hypnotically
repetitive ostinato bass; the modal-like melody of Blanding's "The
Olive Tree"; the groove-driven rhythms of Printup's "The Inception"
(from his just-released album "The New Boogaloo").</LD>
<TE>   But for the most part, this was an evening dedicated to
stretched-out, individual soloing. And that, of course, is an
approach filled with promise and problems. Improvised solos reaching
out beyond the five-minute area can produce grand emotional
experiences, as John Coltrane proved time and time again. But they
also can quickly lose their effectiveness if they are based primarily
upon the fast-fingered acrobatics of technical virtuosity.</TE>
<TE>   Printup's playing tended to lean toward the direction of
improvisational pyrotechnics in the early part of the
set--successfully, for the most part, because of his impressive
command of the instrument. But he took his playing to a higher
musical level near the close of his program, especially during a
turbocharged, up-tempo romp through the Kurt Weill standard "Speak
Low."</TE>
<TE>   Blanding's offerings, however, were enigmatic, roving between hard
bop quickness and wild-eyed, avant-garde honks and squeals. That
said, his most positive attribute was his refusal to sound like
anyone other than himself. When Blanding sorts out all the differing
parts of his style into a coherent musical voice, he may well emerge
as an important player.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis has a reputation as a versatile artist, and the pianist
displayed it throughout the set, accompanying with sensitivity and
style while contributing solos energized by a passionate musical
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Supporting this barrage of individual efforts, bassist Vincente
Archer and drummer Donald Edwards generated a continuous flow of
propulsive rhythmic swing.</TE>

<HD>Adding a Twang to a Prog-Rock Classic</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Luther Wright &amp; the Wrongs redo Pink Floyd's
'The Wall' as a country album.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A wall made from hay bricks? When Luther Wright &amp; the Wrongs used
that prop in a few shows last year in Canada, it was a wink at the
massive structure (non-hay) Pink Floyd built on stage in 1980 when
performing its album "The Wall."</LD>
<LD>   But more immediately, the barnyard stunt celebrated Wright &amp; the
Wrongs' new version of that classic progressive-rock concept album,
in which they recast all 26 songs in country and bluegrass settings.</LD>
<LD>   "We did some shows in Canada with 40 bales of straw and various
farm implements and some film clips," says Wright, who brings his
band (but no hay) to Molly Malone's on Saturday. "We needed a
separate vehicle to bring the straw, and the bars hated us. We made a
real mess." The band, though, did not make a mess of the music. The
album, "Rebuild the Wall," reveals that inside the Floyd album was a
bunch of country songs waiting to get out, from the musical
structures to the themes of inner pain and defiant individualism. It
was a revelation that came to Wright, 38, while he and the band were
on tour in Canada in early 2000. He was playing guitar along to the
radio in the van when the song "Another Brick in the Wall" came on.</LD>
<TE>   "I kept playing--dinga-ding-ding-dinga-ding," Wright says,
imitating the sound of guitar picking. "I realized that when you
think about it, 'The Wall' has got the country elements.</TE>
<TE>   "So later we started playing along to other songs from the album,
and as we got into it more, we got into the themes being classic
country hurtin' themes. So we talked about it for a while and then
said, 'We'd better prove our point.' "</TE>
<TE>   That started a process that at first seemed simple enough, just a
little goof. But the further they got into it, the more serious the
project became.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is we really tried to not make it a real
nyuk-nyuk thing," says Wright. "We're trying to avoid the jokey-band
thing. But it was hard not to be tongue in cheek with some of it."</TE>
<TE>   The band does a pretty good job of balancing the laughs with
artistic interpretation, and the album fits neatly in the middle of a
current wave of twanged-up classic-rock tributes, from Hayseed
Dixie's novel AC/DC tribute to Drive-By Truckers' "Southern Rock
Opera," a surprisingly non-jokey meditation on life and death in the
career of Lynyrd Skynyrd.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it goes a bit far," Wright admits of his album. "But
the reason we did 'The Wall' was that it all made sense."</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, it also made sense to Roger Waters, who, while with
Pink Floyd, wrote nearly the entire album.</TE>
<TE>   "We contacted him through e-mail via his manager," Wright says.
"We sent a CD-R and wrote a letter, gave him all the lyric changes we
made, explained why. We waited for a couple of months and he sent an
e-mail saying that he listened and approved. It's total reverence to
the music and the songs."</TE>
<TE>   Where the project didn't seem to make sense was in the band's
career track. Based in Wright's hometown of Kingston, Ontario, the
Wrongs formed five years ago as a side project of Weeping Tiles, a
quartet fronted by singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer (who duets on
"Mother" on "Rebuild the Wall").</TE>
<TE>   "I'd always been writing country songs," Wright says. "We decided
to start a band to pursue the hurtin' country thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Wrongs debuted with a 1997 album, "Hurtin' for Certain," and
followed in 1999 with "Roger's Waltz," becoming a full-time venture
when Weeping Tiles broke up and Harmer pursued a solo career.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wright's own songs are the band's focus (a third album of
original material has been completed with plans for a 2002 release),
it's "Rebuild the Wall" that is drawing the most attention. Last
year, the group released half the project as "Rebuild the Wall Part
1" in Canada, receiving positive reviews and even some airplay from
the public radio Canadian Broadcasting Corp. and adult alternative
stations.</TE>
<TE>   A copy sent to U.S. label Back Porch Records, which is distributed
by Virgin Records, led to the release of the complete album here in
June, with a couple of videos from the project getting exposure on
the Country Music Television cable outlet.</TE>
<TE>   Wright has no problem with a novelty side trip as the band's
calling card.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed auspicious that 'The Wall' was our destiny," he says.
"Now that we're out getting more recognition, people are discovering
us beyond 'The Wall' stuff. I'm glad we weren't just talking and
actually made the album. The songs are really emotive. It's the same
feeling as singing on my own songs."</TE>
<TE>   Luther Wright &amp; the Wrongs, with No North and Saucy Monkey, play
Saturday at Molly Malone's, 575 S. Fairfax Ave., L.A., 9 p.m. $5.

<HD>No One Can Blame TV for Big-Biz Mess</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no biz like big biz.</LD>
<LD>   We know that from the conga line of CEOs and other key executives
from giant companies suspected of hanky-panky in the wave of
accounting scandals pounding Wall Street and costing investors their
savings.</LD>
<LD>   Confidence in capitalism's top guns has sunk in recent months,
along with the stock market. It's now so low that President Bush, no
foe of business, is motivated to censure them with an eye toward
restoring confidence in the economy. And hundreds of corporations
were ordered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to file
sworn statements this week attesting to the accuracy of their recent
financial reports.</LD>
<TE>   Corruption reeking at the loftiest corporate levels? Possible
criminal behavior by the rich and mighty?</TE>
<TE>   A perfect greed-driven scenario for TV drama.</TE>
<TE>   One that prime time has traditionally turned to for big ratings,
from scheming J.R. Ewing in "Dallas"--who once engineered a foreign
coup to regain his holdings--to "The Simpsons," where Homer's
nefarious boss, Mr. Burns, operates a pollution-spewing nuclear power
plant and other shady ventures that make him the most powerful man in
Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   It's a widely evoked TV scenario, also, that used to be condemned
regularly by conservatives who accused the medium of an anti-business
bias (even though the television industry itself was big business).</TE>
<TE>   These were voices of the right who believed that TV entertainment
shilled for the left. The same voices that, in light of accounting
debacles embroiling Enron, Arthur Andersen, WorldCom and others, are
now silent on this topic, apparently in the belief that this is no
time to champion corporations and attack TV for making big business a
heavy.</TE>
<TE>   Big business is doing that well enough on its own.</TE>
<TE>   The silent ones include even ranting, red-in-the-face L. Brent
Bozell. Yet it was only five years ago that left-bashing Bozell and
his conservative watchdog, the Media Research Center of Alexandria,
Va., were crowing about their 26-month study declaring broadcast TV's
prime time guilty of "cynicism toward business that it does not show
toward any other" occupations.</TE>
<TE>   What a difference a few years make, ironically, for most of what
Bozell's group derided would probably earn those networks plaudits
today.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 study, for example, found that TV's business characters
committed more crimes, including murder, than those depicted in other
occupations, and were more likely to cheat than contribute to
society. Characters in big business, moreover, were portrayed by TV
as more contemptible than those in small business.</TE>
<TE>   These findings closely corroborated an earlier study by the
Washington-based Media Institute that found that more than half of
corporate chiefs on TV committed crimes ranging from fraud to murder.</TE>
<TE>   Take away TV's emphasis on murder, and what you have here pretty
much echoes anti-business public opinion today--an unfair assessment
of collective guilt that approaches the berating U.S. lawyers
regularly get from Bush and other critics of the legal community.</TE>
<TE>   The Media Research Center went on to urge that prime-time
programmers consider "the possible effect this bias could have on
society." There's been no evidence of this TV abuse shaping attitudes
about business, however, or that the nation's ill will toward
corporate America predated today's on-going Wall Street follies.</TE>
<TE>   Why does TV so frequently cast big-business characters as vile
scum? Don't join Bozell in looking for sneaky ideologues hoping to
fill brains with anti-capitalist propaganda. Although TV projects
biases regularly, it's largely the product of pragmatists not
cabalists aligned to a specific political philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   "Blacks, women, Italians, Hispanics, everyone writes letters
complaining about how they are portrayed on television," Barney
Rosenzweig, executive producer of "Cagney &amp; Lacey," once told the New
York Times. "That's why I love businessmen--they don't write me
letters."</TE>
<TE>   Nor are many likely to start protesting now, given the dramatic
loss of credibility by rich corporate moguls--including even Martha
Stewart--accused of getting still richer at the expense of investors.
In fact, all of this makes them even fatter targets in dramas that
traditionally pluck ideas from headlines.</TE>
<TE>   "No one argues that all businessmen are squeaky clean or
necessarily better than the population [as] a whole," Michael Fumento
wrote in Investor's Business Daily a decade ago. "But the crimes that
businessmen sometimes do commit--embezzlement, income tax evasion,
selling faulty goods, hiding bad effects of products, antitrust
violations, insider trading--are rarely the ones they are depicted as
committing."</TE>
<TE>   Expect that to change.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Blah blah blah about business extends all across television these
days, from the gasbaggery of pundits on talk and interview shows to
the snickers aimed at this week's economic forum called by Bush in
Waco, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It was here, at the Baylor University law school, where TV cameras
at one point captured the president apparently deep in thought,
judiciously taking notes as someone else spoke, then tearing off a
sheet of paper and taking more notes.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, please. The business of presidents, and all politicians, has
always included posing for self-serving photo ops.</TE>
<TE>   This one reminded me of a day in 1980 when I was riding the press
bus accompanying Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) as he campaigned in
Illinois for the Democratic presidential nomination (which incumbent
Jimmy Carter would win).</TE>
<TE>   When Kennedy's bus came to an unscheduled halt at a service
station, he jumped off and, encircled by cameras, engaged an
attendant in a dialogue beside a pump. Kennedy's manner was grave,
his face projecting concern.</TE>
<TE>   What was that all about? I asked a Kennedy aide, and he replied:
"The senator's learning about the price of gas." He didn't already
know? And he could learn only while basking in the sunlight of
dutifully attentive media?</TE>
<TE>   There's also no biz like show biz.</TE>

<KH>All That Jazz</KH>
<HD>A Broader View of American Music</HD>
<DH>To Justo Almario, who will be honored as part of Jazz
Pilgrimage 2002, Latin jazz embraces all of the Americas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who's heard saxophonist-flutist Justo Almario in action has to
wonder why this extraordinary player has had such relatively low
visibility throughout his highly productive musical career. Since he
settled in the Los Angeles area in the '70s, the Colombian-born
artist has performed in every imaginable musical style, with artists
ranging from Freddie Hubbard and Roy Ayers to the Clayton-Hamilton
band, Poncho Sanchez and almost any other major Southland player one
can mention.</LD>
<LD>   And that's just the beginning. Looking back only a year or so, I
can recall hearing Almario perform in the heated salsa environment of
Pete Escovedo's band, leading his own small, straight-ahead Latin
jazz group at the Central Avenue Jazz Festival; in an all-star
Newport Jazz Festival band with Joe Lovano and Terence Blanchard at
Royce Hall; with Francisco Aguabella and the Jazz on the Latin Side
All Stars at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre; and, of course, with
the inspired ensemble Tolu, the group he has been leading on and off
for years with drummer-percussionist Alex Acuna. In each case,
playing alto, tenor and soprano saxophones, as well as flute and
clarinet, he has adapted perfectly to his surroundings, delivering
brilliantly inventive solo after solo.</LD>
<TE>   A much belated but much deserved recognition of Almario's
extraordinary talents takes place on Aug. 25 at the Ford
Amphitheatre, when he will be honored as a highlight event in Jazz
Pilgrimage 2002, a concert featuring the Jazz on the Latin Side All
Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Almario's playing that evening will undoubtedly reflect his
all-embracing musicality as well as, above all, his belief in the
far-reaching embrace of Latin jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "For many years, people only knew Latin jazz as a combination of
Cuban rhythms and jazz," Almario says. "Then in the '60s, we had
bossa novas. But there is much more music from all the Americas, many
countries--Peru, Colombia, Panama, Puerto Rico--with many rhythms and
sounds."</TE>
<TE>   Exploration has been an essential element not only in Almario's
playing, but also in the approach he and Acuna have taken with Tolu.
(That sense of diversity is a constant presence in the group's new,
whimsically titled CD, "Bongo de Van Gogh.")</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to keep working in this direction," he says,
"finding the excitement in the rhythms and music of these different
cultures, letting people know about them. And jazz is the best form
in which to do it, because it's music from the soul, rhythmic and
improvised."</TE>
<TE>   Almario, 53, who reports he is now in good shape after recovering
from a life-threatening illness, is looking forward to the Ford
program.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very thankful to receive this honor," he says. "And I'm
thankful to be here, practicing, working on my horns, trying to play
the best I can. Because my music and my life are gifts, something I
appreciate every day."</TE>
<TE>   Mancini Musings. It's unlikely that Henry Mancini and Thelonious
Monk ever crossed paths in their illustrious careers. But each has
been the financial and promotional foundation for an important
educational institution: the Henry Mancini Institute and the
Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, the Mancini Institute annual season concludes with
a fund-raiser musicale at UCLA's Royce Hall, climaxing a month-long
program in which more than 80 scholarship students from the U.S. and
more than a dozen other countries have participated in seminars,
master classes, individual instruction and a variety of performance
ensembles, including a full symphony orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   The close of the institute's sixth installment finds the
organization at an important developmental stage as the mantle has
passed from its founder, Jack Elliott, who died last year, to its new
artistic director, composer-arranger Patrick Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The Monk Institute, in contrast, seems to be moving smoothly
through its now well-established, diversified activities: the
Institute of Jazz Performance, in which a small but select group of
musicians study tuition-and cost-free for two years at USC under the
guidance of major figures such as artistic director Terence
Blanchard; the International Jazz Competition, a highly regarded
event that has produced such impressive winners as pianists Marcus
Roberts, Jacky Terrasson, Ted Rosenthal and Bill Cunliffe, singer
Jane Monheit, trumpeter Ryan Kisor, and saxophonists Joshua Redman
and Seamus Blake; and the National Jazz Curriculum and Jazz in the
Classroom, both aimed at bringing the music's cultural richness to
classrooms throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Contrasts between the Mancini and Monk programs obviously have a
great deal to do with their differing creative missions, as well as
the fact that the Monk Institute--now in its 16th year--has been in
existence a decade longer than the Mancini Institute. But the
programs offered this year by the latter have underscored the
importance of defining what the mission will be in the post-Elliott
phase of its growth.</TE>
<TE>   The three full orchestra programs presented a tribute to Elliott
(featuring some of his music), a film music program and last
Saturday's mixed bag of musical items, highlighted by selections from
saxophonist-composer Bob Belden's "Black Dahlia." Belden's work, in
particular, displayed the unusually high skills of this year's
orchestral talent. Conceived as a musical suite paralleling the
famous 1947 Los Angeles murder, still unsolved, of aspiring actress
Elizabeth Short, the "Black Dahlia" score is filled with lush,
dissonant string textures and turbulent currents of rhythm--the
work's dark, atmospheric sense of time and place beautifully captured
by the orchestra's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Performances by the Institute Big Band included a collection of
Neal Hefti tunes and suites by Anthony Wilson and Don Sebesky. The
Institute Chamber Orchestra offered selections from Swiss
composer-saxophonist Daniel Schnyder's "Songbook for Saxophone and
Orchestra," and two chamber ensemble programs showcased student
groups led by Billy Childs, Bill Cunliffe and others. Guest artists
at the various concerts included bassist Christian McBride,
clarinetist Eddie Daniels, keyboardist Larry Goldings, saxophonist
Bob Sheppard, trumpeter Randy Brecker and flutist Hubert Laws.</TE>
<TE>   That's a healthy collection of music, virtually all of it
well-performed. What was missing was focus--as though Williams had
tossed as many thematic notions as possible into the programming in
the hope that they would somehow, on their own, coalesce into a
meaningful thematic basis for the future.</TE>
<TE>   That won't work. What's needed is a firmer sense of guidance and
direction involving decisions over whether the institute intends to
simply present its scholarship musicians with a pleasant summer month
encountering eclectic but not always challenging pieces of music. Or
whether it intends to fulfill what seemed to be the prior mission of
urging the players in the direction of versatility via a demanding,
high-level stretching of the musical envelope.</TE>
<TE>   Another, equally significant issue that needs to be addressed--one
that existed in previous years as well--is the question of minority
representation in the various ensembles. Williams insists that the
selection process, in which he visited many of the country's major
music schools and conservatories, was aimed solely at picking the
best qualified musical candidates. But the net result was a big band
in which there were no African American players and only a sole
female, as well as an overall collection of participants in the full
orchestra dismally lacking in Latino presence.</TE>
<TE>   Also worth noting: Although there was a large proportion of female
artists in the string and woodwind sections, there were none who
played saxophone, trumpet or, with one exception, trombone--an
unfortunate manifestation of the brass ceiling that has long tended
to divert female artists from those instruments.</TE>
<TE>   Given the circumstances, the only conclusion one can reach is that
the institute's selection process needs to reach out to more diverse
destinations for its auditions. I'm not suggesting that a quota
system should be installed, nor do I intend in any way to demean the
high quality of the players this year. But the country is filled with
diverse players fully capable of competing for positions in the
institute's orchestra--if they're given the opportunity to do so.</TE>
<TE>   As bassist-composer-bandleader John Clayton, an African American,
has pointed out to me, "Hank [Mancini] was a pioneer in helping to
integrate the studios, as was Jack [Elliott]. Indeed, my first
professional recording and my first TV show were for Mancini."</TE>

<HD>Romantic Grass Is Greener</HD>
<DH>In 'The Last Kiss,' more lighthearted than serious,
beautiful people in Italy who want it all struggle with love and
fidelity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not everyone having a midlife crisis is middle-aged. Or, for that
matter, even in a real crisis. "The Last Kiss" is a pleasantly tart
Italian comic drama about love, lies, fidelity and infatuation. It's
a mainstream European look at intimate relationships, too
sophisticated to be as pat as Hollywood would make it but still not
eager to go deep enough to alienate a paying audience.</LD>
<LD>   Writer-director Gabriele Muccino struck that balance quite nicely,
turning out a film that won several David di Donatello Awards
(Italy's version of the Oscars), earned enough to be one of that
country's top-grossing films last year and even shared Sundance's
audience award for world cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Like many another genteel soap opera, "The Last Kiss" focuses on
beautiful people coping with all manner of romantic crises. Because
people in actual midlife are not necessarily all that photogenic, the
film concentrates on characters in their 30s, caught in the last gasp
of what they assumed would be eternal adolescence.</LD>
<TE>   "The Last Kiss' " central couple, 30-year-old Carlo (Stefano
Accorsi) and his 27-year-old live-in girlfriend Giulia (Giovanna
Mezzogiorno) are introduced at a key point in their relationship: She
is pregnant, and they have decided to marry and have the child.</TE>
<TE>   But Carlo, talking in voice-over as they drive to break the news
to both sets of parents, is not without his "is this all there is?"
doubts. He feels trapped more than exhilarated by impending
fatherhood, worrying about what he might be missing by settling down.</TE>
<TE>   The couple's news also triggers doubts in Giulia's parents,
especially in her mother Anna (Stefania Sandrelli), enmeshed in a
tortured marriage and also not willing to say that her romantic life
is over. Having Anna's part played by Sandrelli, who starred in the
similarly themed "Divorce Italian Style" decades ago, adds a
particular poignancy to the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Completely horrified by Carlo's plans is his co-worker and best
friend Adriano (Giorgio Pasotti). Married with an infant son, he says
parenthood is worse than Carlo can imagine. Hours are spent calming
the baby down, and "as soon as you get him to sleep, he's hungry and
you have to start over."</TE>
<TE>   Equally disgruntled is a third friend, Paolo (Claudio Santamaria),
who is trying to cope with a particularly painful breakup and the
impending death of his estranged father. Paolo proposes that all the
guys abruptly drop out and head for another country. "To give sense
to life," he says, "you have to escape, change."</TE>
<TE>   To anyone over 30, the sight of this crew agonizing about the need
to feel alive, worrying that "the good life," whatever that is, is
passing them by and being terrorized by the mere mention of the age
40 plays like self-absorbed silliness. As writer-director Muccino has
said, this film "is about the fear of growing up," not necessarily a
subject of endless fascination.</TE>
<TE>   Helping the film's watchability is the more classic screen dilemma
faced by Carlo. At a wedding early in the film he meets the stunning
Francesca (Martina Stella). When he tells her he's in advertising,
she replies that she's in high school. Beautiful, self-possessed,
just turned 18 and completely mad about Carlo, she is his ultimate
fantasy turned terrifyingly real. How Carlo handles this
be-careful-what-you-wish-for situation creates some truly farcical
moments.</TE>
<TE>   "The Last Kiss" also gets considerable energy from its national
setting. Italians in love, messing up their lives, yelling, screaming
and spitting in each other's faces while insisting "I have to be
calm" create a level of emotional force that simply wouldn't be there
in a more buttoned-up culture.</TE>
<TE>   Though one of its characters says, "If people are marrying for
thousands of years, there must be reason," "The Last Kiss" is too
much of a modern entertainment to come down on one side or the other.
Its portrait of the many ways we can complicate our romantic lives
may have a few serious moments, but it's intended to go down easy,
and that's what it does.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, sexuality and some drug use. Times
guidelines: much sexual talk and brief nudity but otherwise fairly
tame.</TE>

<DH>Eddie Murphy's 'Pluto Nash,' out today, is getting bad
buzz. If it bombs, he'll be just the latest famous name to have
starred in a true clunker for the ages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years after completing production, the Eddie Murphy comedy "The
Adventures of Pluto Nash" finally arrives in theaters today. The
Castle Rock film, in which Murphy plays a nightclub owner on the moon
battling the mafia for control of his establishment, has had a
troubled production that included re-shoots; it reportedly cost about
$100 million. Critics weren't invited to see the movie before it
opened--usually an indication of trouble.</LD>
<LD>   Along with his huge hits, Murphy has had some bona fide stinkers
over the years. In the 1998 comedy "Holy Man," Murphy played a TV
evangelist named G. The $60-million film eked out a bit more than $12
million at the box office. And back in 1984, before "Beverly Hills
Cop" made him a superstar, he appeared with Dudley Moore in an
ill-fated war comedy called "Best Defense." It was directed by
Willard Huyck, best known for the legendary flop "Howard the Duck"
(1986).</LD>
<LD>   But if "Pluto" turns out to be a dog, Murphy has some
distinguished company among Hollywood's elite:</LD>
<TE>   * John Travolta is one of the all-time masters of box-office
disasters. The romantic comedy "Lucky Numbers" (2000) received
dreadful reviews and brought in unlucky numbers at the box office,
grossing only about $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after "Lucky Numbers" tanked, the Scientologist's pet
project, "Battlefield Earth" (2000), based on Scientology founder L.
Ron Hubbard's best-selling sci-fi thriller, was released to even
worse reviews. Budgeted at $73 million, it took in $21.5 million
after two months in release.</TE>
<TE>   Three years earlier, Travolta, Dustin Hoffman and director
Costa-Gavras bombed out in the thriller "Mad City," which took in
just $11 million. But the ultimate Travolta disaster was the 1978
romance "Moment by Moment," a classically trashy movie in which he
plays a young stud named Strip who romances an older woman (Lily
Tomlin).</TE>
<TE>   * Kevin Costner could do no wrong at the box office in the late
'80s and early '90s, but he's had more ups and downs in his career
than a Magic Mountain roller coaster ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Though he won an Oscar for directing the 1990 hit, "Dances With
Wolves," the academy and audiences felt differently about his second
directorial effort, the 1997 adventure "The Postman." The three-hour
dog, with a hefty $80-million budget, was released by Warner Bros. at
Christmas but quickly tanked, making just $17.6 million after two
months in release.</TE>
<TE>   And last year, Costner's violent thriller, "3,000 Miles to
Graceland," took a critical drubbing and was a commercial disaster:
The $62-million film snared only $15.7 million at the box office.</TE>
<TE>   * Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman: The Academy Award-winning pair
starred in one of the most infamous bombs of the 1980s--the 1987
comedy "Ishtar," in which the two play hapless nightclub singers.
Even the name "Ishtar" has become synonymous with box-office
disasters.</TE>
<TE>   Beatty also co-starred with Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Garry
Shandling and Andie MacDowell in "Town and Country" (2001), a
romantic comedy that was years in the making and remaking. With a
swollen budget of $90 million, the film quickly disappeared from
theaters after taking in only $6.7 million in its first month in
release.</TE>
<TE>   * Woody Allen's own films haven't exactly been big at the box
office in recent years, but "Picking Up the Pieces" (2000), a black
comedy he made for director Alfonso Arau, went straight to Cinemax.
The comedy, which finds Allen playing a kosher butcher with an
unfaithful wife, also starred Sharon Stone and David Schwimmer.</TE>
<TE>   * Whoopi Goldberg probably doesn't mention "Theodore Rex" (1995)
on her resume. This $33-million misfire finds the Oscar-winner
playing a tough female cop who is teamed up with a talking dinosaur
partner. The film went straight to video and TNT cable.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, stars from Hollywood's golden age have numerous films
in the turkey hall of fame.</TE>
<TE>   * Clark Gable tried to forget his stodgy 1937 historical drama
"Parnell," in which he was sorely miscast as the famed Irish freedom
fighter.</TE>
<TE>   * Laurence Olivier was considered one of the greatest actors of
all time. But you wouldn't know that from his performance in the 1981
film "Inchon," in which he sported some ghastly makeup to play Gen.
Douglas MacArthur. Jacqueline Bisset, Ben Gazzara and Toshiro Mifune
also starred in this $46-million flick which was five years in the
making and funded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Quickly pulled from
theaters because of poor box office, "Inchon" swept the first-annual
Golden Raspberry Awards for the worst film of the year.</TE>
<TE>   * John Wayne made one of his greatest films, the John Ford western
"The Searchers," in 1956. And that same year saw the release of one
of his worst: "The Conqueror." Who can forget the image of Duke
sporting a Fu Manchu</TE>
<TE>   mustache and slanted eyes to play the role of Mongolian chief
Genghis Khan.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Pluto Nash' Review Delayed</TE>
<TE>   "The Adventures of Pluto Nash," a sci-fi comedy starring Eddie
Murphy, also opens today in general release. Because Warner Bros. did
not make the film available for screenings, The Times' review will
appear on Monday.</TE>

<HD>'Lily's' Teens Cope With Savagery Amid Affluence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shunji Iwai's "All About Lily Chou-Chou" is bravura, ambitious and
profoundly disturbing. It is also a daunting, demanding experience,
one whose complex structure makes it a challenge to track despite
literate subtitles.</LD>
<LD>   Not everyone will be willing to go the 146-minute distance of a
film that can be maddeningly hard to follow and uncompromisingly
bleak. But those who do will have felt just how all-important music
can be to unhappy and endangered teenagers and how savagery can sweep
over young people, even in the most seemingly stable and prosperous
communities.</LD>
<LD>   Iwai's go-for-broke cinematographer Noboru Shinoda's first shot is
of Yuichi Hasumi (Hayato Ichihara, in a remarkable highly
internalized characterization), a slim, handsome boy standing in a
rice field holding his CD player and listening to Lily Chou-Chou, a
Bjork-like singer who has captivated him and countless other Japanese
teens. We then see a gang of teens, aboard a train, steal a dozing
businessman's briefcase and later, looting boxfuls of CDs from a
music store.</LD>
<TE>   We discover that all of this is taking place in a spacious,
attractive city somewhere in Japan, where the gangbangers and Yuichi
attend a very large junior high, a model of sleek, functional
architectural design.</TE>
<TE>   Yuichi, whose mother is a hairdresser and whose home is small but
well-furnished, has pretty much withdrawn into the world of Lily's
shimmering, reassuring, ethereal music. When he's not listening to
her or doing his homework, he is on the Internet, where he's set up a
Lily-philia Web site and is comforted by connecting via constant
e-mail with other admirers of her music.</TE>
<TE>   One day, however, model good kid that he is, Yuichi is caught
swiping a Lily CD. This makes the gang sure he has ratted on them,
and they subject him to a beating so vicious and humiliating that we
can only be grateful that it is so discreetly presented.</TE>
<TE>   Then we're subjected to an abrupt cut to what has got to be a
flashback. We are shocked to discover that the gang's leader, Hoshino
(Shugo Oshinari) has reached out to Yuichi for friendship because
Hoshino has been subjected to widespread ridicule for being an
outstanding student.</TE>
<TE>   It is he who introduces Yuichi to Lily's music, but its seductive
promise surely seems a sham to him ultimately. A rich kid, Hoshino,
has taken up kendo, a Japanese sport of swordplay, at school and
manages to transform himself from "class wimp to class president."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Yuichi, Hoshino has attracted other friends, and they take
a vacation to Okinawa, at which point Shinoda switches to a restless,
jabbing, hand-held camera style of shooting for a deliberately
unsettling effect.</TE>
<TE>   The islands off Okinawa are beautiful, primitive, exotic, sensual
and dangerous. In the distance is an island said to be especially
beautiful, and Yuichi identifies it with a paradise Lily sings about
in a song.</TE>
<TE>   But the boys encounter a naturalist who cheerfully tells them that
his observations of the flora and fauna of the islands suggest that
the region is a hell on Earth, where a tree that strangles other
trees thrives. Then Hoshino nearly drowns.</TE>
<TE>   Back home is soon hell on Earth for Yuichi and others. So shaken
is Hoshino by his brush with death and his family's sudden loss of
its textile mill that he has become a vicious marauder who terrorizes
his school mates. He blackmails a sweet girl, Shiori Tsuda (Yu Aoi),
into a dire fate as a street prostitute. With the tacit approval of
girls who hate Yoko Kuno (Ayumi Ito) for her beauty and talent as a
pianist, Hoshino's thugs subject her to a terrible gang rape and
shave her head.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Yuichi has all but retreated from the savage real world
around him into Lily's soothing music. Not surprisingly, this most
operatic of films climaxes with an inevitable showdown between Yuichi
and Hoshino.</TE>
<TE>   (Takeshi Kobayashi's music and songs are uncannily right for the
hypnotic Lily, who is only barely glimpsed at a concert and whose
voice is supplied by an unbilled singer.)</TE>
<TE>   The school' s faculty and staff, who are kind and well-meaning,
haven't a clue about what's going on. While Iwai creates plenty of
incidents in which the kids' zealous, regimented brutality and swift
allegiance to a strong, sadistic leader jar memories of the
boundless, frenzied militarism of World War II Japan, the feral
behavior of Hoshino and his followers is simply too widely spread not
to have parallels wherever traditional social structures are
crumbling, leaving kids dangerously disaffected.</TE>
<TE>   With its sweeping juxtapositions of the beautiful and the terrible
in both the aural and the visual, "All About Lily Chou-Chou" is
continually jarring. Although the film's narrative thread may prove
chronically elusive, Iwai's depiction of what life can be like for
far too many teens comes across loud and clear.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: extreme violence, mainly off-screen,
and aura of brutality. Some language.</TE>

<HD>Reporter for KNX-AM Fired in Web Site Flap</HD>
<DH>Radio* Part-timer Ron Fineman says he was let go for
posting e-mail critical of a producer Station remains mum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ron Fineman, a part-time reporter for KNX-AM (1070), was fired
Thursday by the news station. He maintains the action stemmed from
negative comments he published about a sister Viacom property,
KCBS-TV, on his Web site.</LD>
<LD>   The site, www.ronfineman.com, is widely read within local
television news circles. It provides a forum for news, rumors and
gossip that is sometimes quoted by local stations. He also analyzes
and frequently criticizes the journalism practiced on TV newscasts.</LD>
<LD>   In his most recent online column, Fineman printed a highly
negative e-mail about a producer at KCBS and low morale within the
newsroom, reportedly sent by a newsroom staffer. According to
Fineman, KNX news director Ed Pyle told him the comments were
inappropriate and let him go after five years at the station. Both
KNX and KCBS are owned by Viacom, which also owns KCAL-TV and Los
Angeles' other news radio station, KFWB-AM (980).</LD>
<TE>   "Ed was very clear about it," Fineman said. "He felt I shouldn't
have allowed those comments to be published." Fineman contends that
KCBS officials had sought to have him fired before, adding, "My guess
is the pressure finally paid off."</TE>
<TE>   Pyle declined to discuss the situation, referring to it as "a
personnel matter." A KCBS spokesman also declined to comment, but
station sources denied that management played a role in the
dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has been running the site for three years, Fineman
said it is not a money-making proposition and that KNX had been his
primary source of income. Despite its popularity among TV news
staffers, some news directors are critical of Fineman, claiming he
publishes erroneous information.</TE>
<TE>   "That's nonsense," Fineman said. "The problem is, they don't want
anyone on the outside looking in."</TE>

<LD>Meet "The Tweaksters": two quirky performers with six-pack abs of
steel, dancers' grace and a penchant for flowerpots, black light and
heavy lifting.</LD>
<LD>   Never mind the sound system that went out at this dynamic duo's
opening matinee Sunday at the Miles Memorial Playhouse or the
theater's limited headroom and backstage area, which made for wary
hoop tosses and peek-a-boo costume and prop changes.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise known as Regan Patno and Julia Snyder, the Tweak- sters
rarely lost the "ooh-ahh" factor in their acrobatic, balletic,
family-friendly feats of strength and balance.</LD>
<TE>   Patno and Snyder set the show's whimsical tone with their opening
vignette: a comical, G-rated black-light strip ease routine, their
bodies visible only as outlines of light until the sight-gag payoff.</TE>
<TE>   A zany "robot" segment is another giggle as they add humor to
their tightly choreographed "mechanical" movements with head-to-head
combat involving Velcro balls and caps.</TE>
<TE>   Then, muscles rippling, they make heavy-duty ropes hung with
weighty "meteors" look like spinning batons, swinging them at high
speed as Snyder balances on Patno's shoulders--keeping an eye out for
the lights not far overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Plastic flowerpots become percussive instruments and eccentric
objects for quick stacking, and in solo spots, Snyder strikes a
lyrical note, twirling long banners and ribbons and shifting rhythms
as she swirls a colorful cape to a mambo beat. Patno goes solo too,
defying gravity with some pole work and, while juggling, beating a
drum and tapping out a medley of pop tunes on a xylophone.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking vignette takes place in the dark. The performers
stretch lighted wires across the stage and manipulate them into
mesmerizing waves and loops.</TE>
<TE>   Missing at the opening show, when the main music system fizzled
halfway through and Patno had to call out music cues to a technician,
was a connecting energy between the pieces.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful that the audience noticed, especially when Patno
levitated pingpong balls over tubes of air or when the pair's
industrial-sized "Pong Shooter" sent balls flying into the audience.</TE>
<TE>   This juggling, balancing, object-manipulating, off-the-wall duo is
captivating fun even when technical glitches jog the rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tweaksters," Miles Memorial Playhouse, 1130 Lincoln Blvd.,
Santa Monica, Sundays at 4 p.m. through Aug. 25. $5-$6. (310)
394-4964.</TE>

<HD>Matchmaking Reality Show Courting TV Viewers in India</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOMBAY, India</DL>
<LD>"Boy meets girl" in India usually means boy meets girl with both sets
of parents in tow. And in a new twist, an Indian reality-TV series is
showing the process of traditional arranged marriages four days a
week.</LD>
<LD>   The young woman and her parents choose one of three men--for
keeps--on the program "There Is Someone Somewhere."</LD>
<LD>   Popular Hindi movie star Madhuri Dixit plays matchmaker-host.
Dressed as if she were attending an Indian wedding, in embroidered
saris and chunky gold jewelry, Dixit dances and sings, "In our hearts
there is hope ... maybe here itself ... there will be an auspicious
marriage."</LD>
<TE>   Dixit met the man she recently wed in a traditional arranged
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Many Indians find spouses through such marriages, where parents
vet proposals sent by friends and relatives. Others place
advertisements in newspapers or use the Internet to reach Indians
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The show, which began two weeks ago, opens the arrangements to the
public. It shifts between segments in young people's homes and
discussions in a Bombay TV studio with Dixit, the potential spouses
and their families hashing things out.</TE>
<TE>   The process stretches over four episodes, with the bride-to-be
meeting potential mates on Monday's and Tuesday's episodes, and the
decision coming by Thursday's. The process then starts with a new
woman the next week.</TE>
<TE>   In traditional arranged marriages, families do extensive checks on
each other. In the televised version, producers conduct background
checks ranging from college grades to the applicant's aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Fans say the show is realistic. "In India, you don't marry just
the boy, you marry the family," says college student Viveka Pandit.</TE>

<HD>'Macbeth' Lives Up to Its Full Title</HD>
<DH>Sacred Fools' vigorously physical production tells
Shakespeare's tragedy with a versatile cast of seven.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In casual discussion, the titles of Shakespeare's plays usually are
shortened to just the protagonists' names: "Hamlet," "Othello," "King
Lear" and so on. But the Sacred Fools production of "The Tragedy of
Macbeth" puts such eloquent emphasis on Macbeth's self-inflicted
downfall that it demands to be known by the full title.</LD>
<LD>   Shakespeare's story roughly parallels that of Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden. The Scottish Lord and Lady Macbeth live in grace as
favorites of the king. But once greatness is whispered in Macbeth's
ear, it drowns out everything else. With his wife as conspirator, he
murders the king and attains the crown, only to be cast out of
paradise.</LD>
<LD>   Director Joe Jordan relates this sprawling story with just seven
identically dressed actors, from whom he has coaxed vigorously
physical performances. The set and costumes are drenched in a color
that looks, portentously, like dried blood, and the action is
ominously underscored by electronic hums, thundering drums and the
shrieks of plucked piano strings (composed by Jef Bek).</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Elam, who plays Macbeth, is less physically imposing than the
muscular Jay Edward Anthony, who plays King Duncan, or Mark TJ
Lifrieri, who plays betrayed buddy Banquo. This lends Macbeth a
poignant sense of ordinariness and vulnerability.</TE>
<TE>   With her porcelain face and cascade of dark curls, Amy Bryson's
Lady Macbeth also looks delicate. But sexual heat and sheer force of
will make her powerful. Whenever Macbeth wavers in his bloody plan,
she is there to urge him on.</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, Jordan (who staged last summer's Brazilian
carnival-flavored "The Comedy of Errors" at Sacred Fools) puts the
action into unexpected perspective, enabling it to be seen in telling
new ways. When the king and his retinue arrive at Macbeth's home, for
instance, they are left waiting for several uncomfortable moments at
the gate--a little snub that forebodes the deadly one to come.
Shortly thereafter, Lady Macbeth arrives as Macbeth is nearing the
end of a soliloquy. He trails off, embarrassed to have been caught
talking to himself.</TE>
<TE>   When the performers--who also include Chad Brummet, Jessie
Thompson and Christine Zirbel--aren't part of the action, they're
manning the instruments.</TE>
<TE>   While it's a neat theatrical stunt to have so few actors tackling
so many roles, confusion is unavoidable. ("Isn't that the king? I
thought he was dead." "No, that actor is playing Macduff now.")</TE>
<TE>   The payoff comes in the end, when the multiple casting adds
psychological dimension to Macbeth's final moments. His first
combatant on the battlefield is his former Lady Macbeth. And when
Macbeth finally faces the entwined king/Macduff, the king seems to be
acting through Macduff to see that justice is served.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tragedy of Macbeth," Sacred Fools Theatre, 660 N. Heliotrope
Drive, Hollywood. Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends Aug. 31. $15.
(310) 281-8337. Running time: 2 hours, 50 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   'This American Life' Makes Movie Deal</LD>
<LD>   If there's one thing Hollywood never seems to have enough of, it's
good ideas for movies and television shows.</LD>
<TE>   So, in a novel move, Warner Bros. Pictures has signed a
first-look, two-year deal with "This American Life," the weekly
Chicago-based public radio show hosted by Ira Glass that delves into
many popular issues of the day in unconventional ways.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, inked with Glass and his producing partner, Julie
Snyder, gives the studio rights to all previous episodes of the show
as well as shows produced over the next two years. The program has
broadcast more than 200 episodes and more than 600 stories to date.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. will not have any editorial control over the radio
program's content.</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, "American Life's" quirky material seems at odds
with the studio's typical mainstream fare. But Glass says the fit is
a good one.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got all these stories and no money, and [the studio] has
all this money and is always looking for stories," he said Thursday.
"It's almost surprising it took this long."</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Politicians Promoting Cell Phone Limits</TE>
<TE>   City councilmen in New York and Toronto say they'll introduce
measures to prohibit people from speaking on cell phones in theaters,
museums and libraries, except in emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plan put forth by New York City Councilman Philip Reed,
violators would be fined up to $50. Toronto City Councillor Kyle Rae
said he'll introduce a similar proposal there in September.</TE>
<TE>   "Public performances offer audiences a welcome escape from the
rigors and gadgets of everyday life," Reed said, "while ringing cell
phones and loud, one-sided conversations offer only headaches."</TE>
<TE>   According to the Toronto Star, the topic is a heated one. Last
month, Ottawa decided not to allow jamming devices in places such as
theaters, restaurants and hospitals. And Toronto Deputy Mayor Case
Ootes contends that banning the use of cell phones in indoor
performance spaces constitutes "unnecessary government interference."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Isozaki's Design Unpopular in Florence</TE>
<TE>   One art critic called it a seven-story bed frame that would freak
out visitors as they departed from the museum, while others have
compared it to a bus-stop shelter. Writing on the front page of a
Milan newspaper, director Franco Zeffirelli proclaimed it an "insult
for all the civilized world."</TE>
<TE>   The subject in question: a new canopy-style entrance to be built
at the rear of Florence's famed Uffizi art gallery, designed by the
renowned Japanese architect Arata Isozaki. By freeing up galleries
now used as corridors, the multimillion-dollar project is expected to
provide additional exhibition space for artworks kept in storage.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers are investigating whether Isozaki, who won the
assignment in an international competition, can be forced to change
his design--and whether the architect can sue for breach of contract
if the project is scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Florence's superintendent of art and architecture, Domenic
Valentino, hoped to assuage critics by asking Isozaki to reduce the
height of the canopy. But Tuscany's top art official, Antonino
Paolucci, favors the original design. "Thanks to the fighting over
the Uffizi exit, that ancient cliche that sees Italians as
undependable is having a glaring, international confirmation," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coining an Image</TE>
<TE>   of the Golden State</TE>
<TE>   The quarters jingling in your wallet or pocket have, for the past
four years, had states represented on the back. Each state is being
honored in the order it ratified the Constitution and joined the
Union--and, in January 2005, it's California's turn.</TE>
<TE>   To come up with a lasting image for the nation's currency, the
state is inviting design proposals from anyone who wants to submit
one.</TE>
<TE>   This "will give California artists the chance to depict all the
vibrancy and energy--past and future--that makes our state the global
center of creativity," said Barry Hessenius, director of the
California Arts Council. Ideas should be mailed between Sept. 9 and
Nov. 9 on official forms obtained at www.governor. ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   A committee selected by Gov. Gray Davis will choose 20
semifinalist designs, from which Davis will select the five finalists
in January. Two months later, he'll submit the entries to the U.S.
Mint, which will determine a winner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Fox is writing and executive producing a TV pilot for
ABC about a retired professional hockey player who finds himself
spending more time with his family--a situation familiar to the actor
who left "Spin City" because of his battle with Parkinson's disease.
Touchstone TV and DreamWorks TV are producing the project.... The
Ahmanson Theatre production of the Tony-nominated "Morning's at
Seven," directed by Daniel Sullivan, will feature Frances Sternhagen,
Piper Laurie, Buck Henry, Elizabeth Franz, Julie Hagerty, Stephen
Tobolowsky, Mary Louise Wilson and William Biff McGuire. The show
will run from Dec. 11 through Jan. 26.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you're having a hard time making it out to the beach as often as
you'd like this summer, Michael O'Brien's exhibition of photographs
at Lemon Sky Projects might be the next best thing. In fact,
depending on how cautious you are in the water, it might be even
better.</LD>
<LD>   An avid surfer as well as a photographer, O'Brien takes viewers
into the very heart of the action. In these pictures there is no
shore, no dock, no boats or life preservers. There is only the wave.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes it's in your face: a loud and violent assault of white
foam. Other times it's arching gracefully over your head, like a dome
of stained glass, or just rolling quietly, gathering speed, several
yards ahead.</LD>
<TE>   No doubt more than a few enthusiastic young surfers have set out
with waterproof cameras over the years to capture that mysterious
thrill that lures people into the waves--and have come home with less
than thrilling prints. O'Brien's photographs--refined and often
strikingly beautiful--fall into a different category, one that
transcends the traditional aesthetics of surf culture without
necessarily disregarding them. The difference seems to be a matter of
practice and of intelligent editing.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear, for one thing, that O'Brien really knows the water.
These pictures obviously stem from years of experience and patient
observation. As a result, he is sensitive to the subtleties of color
and form that might elude a more casual eye, and procures from the
water a surprisingly broad emotional range.</TE>
<TE>   In some pictures, it's playful and enthusiastic; in others, angry
and dangerous; in others, sublimely peaceful. In one particularly
memorable image--a low swirl of cold, foamy gray--it has a brooding
presence.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say just how much further O'Brien can take this work
without eventually becoming repetitive. (This show certainly profits
from its modest size and careful selection.) But considering the
diversity of form, color, mood and expression he's found in the water
already--greater than many are able to produce with a complete
spectrum of paints--it probably wouldn't hurt to go on looking.</TE>
<TE>   Lemon Sky Projects &amp; Editions, 5367 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles,
(323) 931-6664. Through Sept. 7. Closed Sunday and Monday.
(Summertime hours may vary; call ahead.)</TE>

<TE>   Turning Impulses</TE>
<TE>   Into Works of Art</TE>
<TE>   In dealing with the difficulties of daily life, everyone resorts
to fantasy from time to time. On the freeway, perhaps you imagine a
super car that could sprout jets and whisk you out of congested
traffic. At work, you refashion a difficult boss into your personal
assistant. In a long grocery store line, you invent a dark secret
life for the clerk at the register.</TE>
<TE>   "Das Spyder-Man," a group exhibition organized by LACE director
Irene Tsatsos, looks at how a number of artists have translated these
sorts of fantastical impulses into art. The result is a curious
opportunity to glimpse the familiar--common objects, local landscapes
and ordinary circumstances--through the lens of another's
imagination. (The exhibition's title--the relevance of which isn't
exactly clear to me--is said to be a conflated reference to a pair of
summer blockbusters: the movie "Spider-Man" and the German art fair
Documenta.)</TE>
<TE>   It is an interesting collection of work. Several of the most
memorable pieces elaborate on elements of the natural world: Violet
Hopkins' intricate, vaguely Gothic colored pencil drawings of cave
interiors; Brian O'Dell's videos of apparently organic but entirely
unidentifiable and somewhat grotesque surfaces; and Patrick Lakey's
"Fragments from an unlikely narrative" (1997-2001), an evocative
series of photographs taken in a nondescript wooded area.</TE>
<TE>   Other artists work from personal history. David Miller's eerie,
constellation-like photograms, apparently made from the cremated ash
of deceased acquaintances, posit a life after death in both
metaphoric and material terms. The dozen or so architectural-style
drawings in Alexander Morrison's stirring "Every House I've Ever
Lived in Drawn From Memory" (1999-2002) read like blueprints of the
artist's past. Dane Picard's "Portraits, IDs, 2nd Snapshots #2"
(2000)--a video in which a chronological series of photographs
depicting the artist from infancy to the present morph into one
another at a rapid speed--is like a magically animated photo album.</TE>
<TE>   Equally fascinating is Picard's "Sunset Utopia" (2000), another
video in which a drive down Sunset Boulevard breaks down into
hallucinogenic fragmentation. Also set in a familiar region of the
city is Greg Kucera's delightful three-channel video "Line and
Flight" (2001), which drags the viewer, led by a flock of animated
birds, away from a pedestrian crosswalk downtown on a wild,
upside-down ride through the streets of L.A. As with many of the
objects and places represented in this show, you will probably never
think of that crosswalk the same way again.</TE>

<TE>   Veiled Reflections From</TE>
<TE>   Around the World</TE>
<TE>   Judging from this exhibition, Hiroshi Watanabe is an avid
traveler: His photographs come from all over the world. Rather than
capturing the important monuments, sweeping vistas and other obvious
splendors of a place, however, he finds poetry in its details--a pair
of butterflies perched momentarily on a window screen in Japan; a Che
Guevara T-shirt hanging on a clothes line in Ecuador; the mirror on a
makeshift barber shop on a sidewalk in India; or an enormous soap
bubble undulating through ocean air at the Santa Monica Pier.</TE>
<TE>   They're lovely photographs--beautifully composed and expertly
printed. Watanabe's style is traditional but elegant. Like the
Modernists he clearly emulates, he's drawn to interesting forms and
surfaces, and builds his images around unusual juxtapositions of
texture.</TE>
<TE>   One photograph taken in Ecuador, for example, depicts a fur-lined,
plate-glass-covered, shoe store window display adjacent to a chipping
stucco wall. Another depicts a grid of rickety wood cages covered
with disintegrating mesh, through which one sees the faint, feathery
outlines of chickens.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the photographs in the show, which is
appropriately titled "Veiled Observations and Reflections," involve
some element of transparency or reflection. The viewer is continually
looking through screens, mesh, veils, glass, water or mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most beautiful images depicts a swath of netting over
the photographer's head, onto which a small flock of birds has
temporarily landed. Seen through this translucent ceiling, the birds
appear only as overlapping fragments of delicate shadow, an effect
that transforms the photograph into a nearly abstract, wonderfully
striking composition. With a sharp, unassuming eye and an impeccable
aesthetic sense, Watanabe makes a perfect travel companion, if only
for an afternoon.</TE>

<TE>   A Shallow View of</TE>
<TE>   L.A. and Celebrity</TE>
<TE>   Mexican-born, New York-based artist Alex Hank prints photographic
images onto encaustic-covered boards, the surfaces of which are
heavily textured with loose, frenetic brushstrokes. The color is dry
and thin, as though applied in a fine mist, and the palette is
similar to that of an old picture postcard.</TE>
<TE>   The images in this exhibition, Hank's first in Los Angeles, were
apparently taken locally and seem to have been assembled in a spirit
of homage to this city. In one picture, a male Gucci model stares
coolly down from a billboard overlooking Beverly Hills. In another, a
scantily clad woman in stringy high heels sips from a can of soda on
a rooftop, as though in a commercial. In another, an airplane ascends
behind the familiar sight of an In-N-Out Burger sign.</TE>
<TE>   This is a tourist's portrait of L.A., and a shallow one at that.
Hank seems to have come looking for traces of celebrity, consumerism,
glamour--issues at play elsewhere in his work--and of course he finds
them. But so have many before him. This is not new ground. His
particular spin--a posture that seems to want to qualify as both
critical and celebratory--brings little insight.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more important, the images themselves just aren't very
interesting. The cityscapes, all familiar views taken from street
level, betray a patronizing lack of effort, while the
portraits--mostly attractive women, two of whom (in two different
photographs) are inexplicably topless--are little more than decent
snapshots. It's not clear, furthermore, what the encaustic texturing
is meant to bring to the images, except to serve as a sort of
trademark. At best, the effect is neutral; at worst, distracting.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, the work feels quite young--a quality that may,
admittedly, be fitting to its subject. Still, one can't help but
think that with a little more experience in this city, Hank may
discover there are many more interesting angles to be found.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The somnambulant '90s psychedelia of Mazzy Star may be only a wispy
memory, but the dream-pop sensibilities of singer Hope Sandoval's old
band informed her latest project, the Warm Inventions, which made its
L.A. debut on Wednesday at the sold-out El Rey Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Five years after the last Mazzy album, Sandoval teamed with
drummer Colm O'Ciosoig of noise-pop introverts My Bloody Valentine to
release the 2001 album "Bavarian Fruit Bread," a slightly more
human-sounding but still tranquilized set with subtle folk and blues
touches. The 90-minute El Rey performance drew mostly from that
collection, as the duo and four other musicians deftly reproduced the
recording's opiated-to-daydreamy vibe.</LD>
<LD>   You couldn't really see what the players were actually doing with
guitars, harmonica, glockenspiel, keyboards, percussion, etc.,
because the stage remained darkened save for the cozy glow of red
spotlights. This veiled ambience and Sandoval's whispery singing--not
to mention the distortion-festooned encore take on the Rolling
Stones' "Play With Fire"--reinforced the sense of keeping listeners
at a distance while encouraging them to pay careful attention to her
spare, intimate murmurs of remembrance, regret and need.</LD>
<TE>   The musicians bent intently over their instruments, caressing and
finessing the sustained sonic waves as they rode the languorous
melancholy of "Lose Me on the Way," the peaceful, evocative
"Butterfly Mornings" and a Gram Parsons-esque take on the Jesus and
Mary Chain tune "Drop." Still, there was an ember of passion guiding
the nuances, and emotional emphasis came in the crescendo of dueling
distorted guitars, the stark thump of maracas on a drum head and the
subtle twang in Sandoval's voice.</TE>

<HD>A Show of Strength Displayed by Sheila Nicholls at Benefit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>English musician Sheila Nicholls emphasized self-reliance and inner
strength during her Tuesday performance at Hollywood's 1650 club.
These themes nicely complemented the evening's cause--a benefit for
the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN)--and the smart,
witty songs from her sophomore album, "Wake," got the message across
without being preachy.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, even such somber numbers as the inspirational "How
Strong," co-written with hit-producer Glen Ballard, were less about
faltering than about confirming one's own power. Yet the longtime
L.A. resident was most engaging with such amusing and
thought-provoking numbers as the cautionary "Medusa," which
envisioned the snake-haired Gorgon of Greek mythology shaving her
head in order to let people get closer to her, only to lose her
identity and end up growing it back.</LD>
<LD>   Upbeat and charming despite the small audience, the socially
conscious singer-pianist leavened her introspection with a keen sense
of humor in an hourlong set featuring selections from "Wake" as well
as from 1999's "Brief Strop."</LD>
<TE>   Nicholls began the show accompanied only by a guitarist, but most
of the time was backed by a quartet that included stand-up bass and
cello. Though her sophisticated pop ranged agreeably from lushly
pretty to dramatically stark, with subtle folk and jazz accents, the
music ultimately proved less striking than her imagery.</TE>

<HD>Manchester United</HD>
<DH>'24 Hour Party People' is an absorbing tale of a man with a
passion for his city and its raucous music scene</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Wilson, a young Cambridge-educated Manchester TV personality,
was among the 42 people in the city's Lesser Free Trade Hall for a
June 4, 1976, performance of the already notorious Sex Pistols. It
was an electrifying experience for the prescient Wilson, who featured
the band on his weekly program and soon was presenting other bands at
a local club.</LD>
<LD>   Not long after, Wilson and his friend Alan Erasmus (Lennie James)
and band manager Rob Gretton (Paddy Considine) formed Factory
Records, a collective enterprise, and later the Hacienda nightclub.
Between 1976 and 1992, when the Hacienda finally closed, Wilson et
al. would transform rock music and put Manchester on the pop culture
map.</LD>
<LD>   In "24 Hour Party People," a boldly innovative account of Wilson
and Manchester rock, we meet Wilson (Steve Coogan) while on a TV
assignment that required him to try to hang-glide. The stunt flops,
literally, and Wilson informs the audience directly that we can take
the incident as symbolic of what the future holds for him.</LD>
<TE>   As conceived by Coogan, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and director
Michael Winterbottom, with an assist from the real Wilson, Tony
Wilson is a flat-out great screen character. Coogan's Wilson is very
tall, slim with a long aristocratic nose, and he frequently combines
traditional three-piece suits with the long-hair style of the '70s.
He is an imposing figure, given to literary quotations and grandiose
allusions. Wilson's ego knows no limits, but neither does his
passion, and his zeal comes across as astoundingly free from greed.</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Wilson progresses from the callow to the glib, but he
is never unlikable. He never runs out of ideas, and his gift of gab
never fails him.</TE>
<TE>   In one of numerous direct addresses to the camera, he insists he
is but a minor character and that the music is the story. Not here.
Coogan's rendering of Wilson on a larger-than-life scale is endearing
and quixotic. Coogan invests Wilson with a capacity for
self-awareness, even at his most foolish.</TE>
<TE>   The Manchester sound, vibrant and intoxicating and varied over the
years as it flourishes in the many bands Wilson nurtures, is
essentially aural wallpaper, providing a lively background for a
full-bodied portrait of a man who always thought and dreamed big.</TE>
<TE>   Among those 42 people in the audience for the Sex Pistols'
Manchester performance were the Stiff Kittens, soon to become Factory
Records' first stars as Joy Division, fronted by Ian Curtis (Sean
Harris), a singer-composer of such unrelieved intensity that he hung
himself in 1980. Resigned to the conventional wisdom that no group
can survive the loss of its lead singer, Wilson is blown away by Joy
Division's rebirth as New Order.</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, Wilson opened the huge Hacienda, slow to catch on but
finally as popular as Studio 54. It was there that Wilson discovered
Happy Mondays and signed them up to record with gifted, eccentric,
hard-living Martin Hannett (Andy Serkis) at the controls. Ian Curtis
had never heard of Yeats, regarded by Wilson as the greatest poet
since Dante. But to Wilson, the Happy Mondays' Shaun Ryder (Danny
Cunningham) is Yeats' equal. An epic-scale drug abuser and all-around
rowdy, Ryder probably hadn't heard of Yeats either, but for all of
their innovative dance music, the Happy Mondays' profligate,
irresponsible ways would contribute mightily to Factory Records'
downfall. The Hacienda would close in 1992, undermined by patrons who
favored ecstasy over profitable booze. Harris, Serkis and Cunningham
are among at least a dozen key players lending staunch, colorful
support.</TE>
<TE>   In itself, "24 Hour Party People" is amazing, rich in authentic
period atmosphere and detail, an ever-changing cyclorama of a movie
that contains and frames Wilson, who never is allowed to overwhelm
it. Shot with maximum flexibility in digital format by the formidable
Robby Muller, illustrious collaborator of Wim Wenders, Jim Jarmusch
and Lars von Trier, "24 Hour Party People" bursts with nervous
energy. Yet Muller also pulls back for glorious aerial shots of
Manchester at night and a clutch of stunning wide-angle shots. Since
Wilson held on to his newscaster day job, his career in music is
amusingly punctuated by his TV human interest features--one actually
has him learning how to herd sheep.</TE>
<TE>   Having lost his musical empire, Wilson commiserates with a few
colleagues at night on a rooftop, where, in a feeling-no-pain state,
he has a vision of God, who advises him to release a package of
Factory's biggest hits. He is asked by his pals what God looks like.
"He looked like myself," he replies matter-of-factly, reminding them
that after all, "God made man in his image." No man with such
self-regard can know true defeat.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for strong language, drug use and sexuality. Times
guidelines: some profanity, drug use.</TE>

<HD>Whisper to a Roar, With 6,019 Pipes</HD>
<DH>The custom-built Opus 75 organ, being readied for the Sept.
2 opening, represents the culmination of five years of work for a
small Midwest company.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighty feet above the limestone floor of L.A.'s new cathedral, John
Ourensma crouches over a row of organ pipes. Pulling one out of its
wooden rack, he narrows its cone-shaped base with a brass tool that
looks a little like a candle snuffer. Replacing the pipe, he pulls a
walkie-talkie to his mouth. "Try it now," he says. Suddenly a blast
of air sends a shatteringly loud middle C into the confines of the
narrow workspace.</LD>
<LD>   The voice of John Panning, who is seated at the organ console near
the altar, crackles back at him: "That sounds cleaner, fuller. Can
you move on to C sharp? It seems to have some kind of a speech
defect."</LD>
<LD>   One note at a time, "voicers" are adjusting the 6,019 pipes of
Opus 75, which is what Dobson Pipe Organ Builders calls the
instrument it has built for the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.
Four Dobson experts, working in teams of two--one man among the pipes
in the organ case, one at the keyboard console--started in May,
testing and retesting about 61 pipes a day. And even after the
cathedral opens on Sept. 2, they will still be climbing among the
organ's five "floors" of layered pipes and listening intently from
the cathedral floor, making final adjustments.</LD>
<TE>   For the voicers, and the 15 other workers at the Dobson shop back
in Lake City, Iowa, this is the final step in a five-year process. It
began in 1997 with a set of basic specs from the Los Angeles
archdiocese. About half the pipes in the $2-million organ were built
in Iowa (others are hand-me-downs; the rest were built in Germany);
all of it was assembled and pre-voiced in the company's plant and
then transported to Los Angeles and lifted into place. By last
September, the steel-framed organ case--six stories high, 20 feet
across and 10 feet deep--was on the front wall at the right-hand side
of the church. By the end of April, the biggest, heaviest pipes,
which is to say the loudest and deepest, were in place, and the
organ's black cherry-wood-and-organ-pipe facade--designed with
cathedral architect Jose Rafael Moneo--was finished.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's summer, and all but 1,000 of the pipes are installed.
When the voicers turn the organ over to the archdiocese, says Dobson
Pipe Organ Builders founder and president Lynn Dobson, Our Lady of
the Angels should have an instrument for all seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're trying to do is make an organ that will play a broad
range of organ literature as well as meet the demands of the Mass,"
Dobson said. "This instrument really does become a new interpretation
of what the ideal organ can be."</TE>
<TE>   Manuel Rosales, himself an organ builder and the archdiocese's
consultant on Opus 75, is cautiously optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "You buy an organ at great risk," Rosales says. "It's too early to
tell the final result, but the imagination and skill that have gone
into it have been the highest caliber."</TE>
<TE>   At first, the archdiocese wasn't sure it wanted a new organ for
its new cathedral. St. Vibiana's, L.A.'s cathedral starting in the
late 1800s, was closed after the 1994 Northridge earthquake but the
organ survived largely intact. Originally built in the 1920s, it had
been refurbished as recently as the visit of Pope John Paul II in
1987. Why not just reinstall it at Temple and Grand? But it soon
became clear that it wouldn't make much of an impression in a
building meant to hold five times as many people as the old
cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese asked four organ makers to submit ideas for a new
organ, using as many pieces from the old one as possible. A
five-member committee tapped the Dobson company, a small firm that
had never participated in such a high-profile project.</TE>
<TE>   "They chose us," said Dobson, "based on the creativity of our
concept."</TE>
<TE>   Rosales calls Opus 75 three organs in one--the first based on the
"rich, smooth velvety orchestra voices and deep bass pipes" from the
original St. Vibiana's instrument. The second based on "clear,
lighter-voiced pipes" that also came from the old organ, and the
third the "triumphal Dobson organ," which adds or increases fanfare
pipes, reed pipes, bass and brass.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, the company found a way to fit the old and the
new into just the right size box: They met the space requirements set
by Moneo.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, an organ is a simple thing. The pipes--made of tin,
lead-tin alloy or wood--create sound in much the same way as a kid
blowing air through a whistle or across the top of a Coke bottle.
Holes at the bottom let the air in, and slots on the front direct
where the air exits. The pitch is essentially a function of how long
the pipe is; its width and shape control the tone, or "color." The
amount of air helps determine volume, and the airflow is generated by
blowers and controlled by keys, pedals and uber-keys called stops.</TE>
<TE>   A very small organ has one "manual" or keyboard, controlling one
set or rank of pipes. Typically, 61 keys and 61 pipes create a basic
instrument, roughly comparable to a piano in range, with each key and
pipe producing a different pitch but a similar tone quality.</TE>
<TE>   To move up from basic, and to produce sounds of different color,
additional ranks of pipes of different shapes and sizes are required.
You can add a rank that sounds like flutes, for example, or one that
combines sounds to suit Baroque or Romantic music.</TE>
<TE>   As the ranks multiply, so do the number of stops. The organist can
close and open the stops--via knobs on the console--shutting off some
ranks entirely, combining others or even, theoretically, "pulling out
all the stops" and activating every pipe in every rank at once.</TE>
<TE>   The cathedral organ's 6,019 pipes are divided into 105 ranks with
104 stops. It has four manuals and 32 foot pedals. All that makes it
above average in size, with plenty of color, to allow it to play many
kinds of music for many purposes.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the largest L.A. organ; that honor goes to the instrument
at the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, with more than
20,000 pipes and 325 ranks, one of the 10 largest in the world.</TE>
<TE>   And it isn't designed like another new organ coming soon to Los
Angeles, at Walt Disney Concert Hall just up Grand Avenue. That
organ, says Rosales, its builder, is mainly meant "to blast." It
requires bigger and more expensive bass pipes, and it will cost about
$1 million more than the cathedral instrument, even though it won't
be much larger when it comes to the number of pipes and stops.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, the instrument isn't just the pipes, the keys
and the sound design, it's how it all the works inside a particular
building.</TE>
<TE>   "Organs always reflect the acoustical environment they're in,"
says Rosales. "The cathedral is unusual in its rich, big space, which
will provide a great sounding board. An organist's job is to make the
most it can of the acoustic of the space it lives in. That's what the
voicers are doing right now."</TE>
<TE>   From the pews in the nave of the church, Opus 75 is all elegant
burnished wood and a striking asymmetrical assemblage of gleaming
pipes. But if you're climbing hand-over-hand up ladders behind the
facade, things are a little less elegant.</TE>
<TE>   On a midsummer day, with the temperature about 80 degrees in the
organ case, another of the voicers, Bill Ayers is working on the
pipes meant to sound like traditional solo instruments, wedging his
arms into cramped spaces, sometimes working and reworking one pipe
over and over.</TE>
<TE>   "Every pipe is its own individual thing," Ayers says. Right now,
the issue is loudness. "We're listening to hear if each pipe is at
the same volume as we progress up the keyboard."</TE>
<TE>   Around him, the cathedral is dead silent, even though there are
signs of unfinished work everywhere: pews and the baptismal font yet
to be installed, flooring to complete. Technicians are working on the
sound system and the lighting. The Dobson contract, however,
specifies that all such activity must stop by 2:30 p.m. each day so
that the tuning teams can work.</TE>
<TE>   As the voicers work to control the organ's volume, they're also
listening for other ways the pipes can be out of whack. The notes may
sound squawky, raucous or fuzzy. "The voicer makes a pipe sound
elegant or refined, robust and brilliant," says Rosales.</TE>
<TE>   There are about a dozen options when it comes to making things
right. Most of the pipes are "flue" pipes, essentially a metal tube
that the voicer can reshape to some degree. He can increase or
decrease the size of the air hole (smaller equals softer sound;
larger equals louder) or alter the slot through which the air exits,
which modifies color and can also affect volume. Adjusting a metal
disc inside the pipe redirects air toward the slot, which affects how
quickly the pipe "speaks." And if the pitch isn't spot on, the voicer
can roll a strip of metal up or down at the top of some pipes, or
slide a sleeve placed around the top of other pipes to tweak its
length.</TE>
<TE>   "Voicing sounds simple," says Panning, "but it isn't." It has to
be mastered through apprenticeship, and voicers rely only on their
ears, no other instruments, to get it right.</TE>
<TE>   The work is both delicate and rough. The pipes can be easily
damaged, and making one change sometimes throws the pipe into an
opposite error.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of the tuning process for Opus 75, what the
voicers heard wasn't what they'd hoped for.</TE>
<TE>   "The decibel level was too low," explains Dobson. "We had to raise
the wind pressure considerably. All the work that was done in the
shop had to be redone. Luckily we were in the ballpark."</TE>
<TE>   The problem, he says, was the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "In an ideal situation," he says, "we would wait to start work
until the building was finished." In other words, the organ wouldn't
be finalized until the instrument's makers could hear and test real
acoustics in a real space, complete with roof, walls, windows and, in
this case, people in the pews. But that would have meant no organ for
the opening of Our Lady of the Angels, an outcome that wasn't
acceptable to the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   "The cathedral didn't even have a roof above it when we brought in
test pipes," says Dobson. "We had to guess how many decibels each
pipe had to put out."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, working out the balance between what is optimal for the
organ and what is possible in the cathedral, has required fancy
footwork throughout the process. Take the issue of the placement.
Acoustically, the best location for an organ is on a building's
central axis, facing the listeners. But that wasn't where Moneo first
wanted it.</TE>
<TE>   "Originally, the organ was on the side in the transept area and
was not visible from the whole room," said Dobson. "We had a lot of
discussion about that. It wasn't easy to suggest changes, but Moneo
was willing to listen."</TE>
<TE>   The organ isn't winning all the battles. The cathedral is built
for speech as well as for music, and the two aims compete. Organs
love long reverberation time, but too much reverb and you'll get a
garbled homily. Dennis Paoletti, the cathedral's principal acoustical
consultant, has put speakers in the overhead lighting fixtures to
keep voices clear, and he has cut down on reverberation by placing
baffling material in the ceiling and the tapestries that hang on the
cathedral's walls.</TE>
<TE>   You can hear the organ well, says Rosales, but adjustments "remove
the feeling that the sound is filling the room. The beauty of a large
room is its ability to enhance subtlety. That's long gone because of
the need for speech intelligibility."</TE>
<TE>   By early August, the voicers are about two-thirds of the way
through the pipes, with enough completed to sound out a few tunes to
test their work. Rosales is happy: "An organ in a setting like this
cathedral needs to play very softly and very powerfully and
everything in between. If it doesn't roar and shake the building as
well as quietly 'sit' behind someone who is praying, it's a failure,"
he says. "This organ can certainly whisper. I have no doubt that it
will be able to roar."</TE>
<TE>   And the way the sound is shaping up justifies the decision to put
a new organ in new cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   "The full sensual experience of hearing music made by an
organ--it's more than just sound," Rosales says. "It adds a dimension
that we respond to."</TE>
<TE>   As the days speed by toward the cathedral's opening, the Dobson
team refuses to be rushed. They're still sounding one pipe at a time
and comparing that one with all the pipes they've voiced so far. And
they're still contending with the changing acoustics as the Paoletti
teams continue to work at cutting down reverberation and muffling
noise from the air-conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be finished until we're finished," says Panning. "It's
an artistic endeavor. Our business manager would like us to be able
to say we're going to be done at such and such a time. But in the end
the most important thing is that it sounds right. We have a good idea
of how long that will take. It ends up taking what it takes."</TE>

<HD>'Possession' Is Lost With Just One Misstep</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's no zeal like the zeal of the newly converted, and so it is
that sections of Neil LaBute's frustratingly uneven version of
"Possession" just about glow with a satisfying romantic warmth not
only unknown but even anathema to the writer-director's earlier work.</LD>
<LD>   When his "In the Company of Men" debut was followed quickly by
"Your Friends &amp; Neighbors," LaBute acquired a reputation for icy
misanthropy that not even the nominally cheerier "Nurse Betty" could
dispel. With A.S. Byatt's novel, however, LaBute was taking on a
distinctly different kind of material.</LD>
<LD>   Literate, thrilling and philosophical, a ripping detective yarn as
well as a pleasing romance, the Booker Prize-winning "Possession" was
one of the most satisfying novels of the 1990s, blessed with a
smashing premise expertly worked out.</LD>
<TE>   That was the notion of following a pair of English scholars
investigating the incendiary secret lives of two Victorian poets, and
the present day academics find themselves more attracted to each
other the deeper they dig into the past.</TE>
<TE>   With the work of a crack production team (including production
designer Luciana Arrighi and costume designer Jenny Beavan ) and
luminously photographed by Jean Yves Escoffier, the film echoes the
book in cutting back and forth between then and now. It reveals the
raptures and difficulties of the Victorian couple (Jeremy Northam and
Jennifer Ehle), as well as the exertions, romantic and otherwise, of
the modern pair (Gwyneth Paltrow and Aaron Eckhart).</TE>
<TE>   Although his sensibility has been exclusively contemporary up to
now, LaBute (who shares screenwriting credit with David Henry Hwang
and Laura Jones) shows a surprising facility for the lush romance of
the film's Victorian sections.</TE>
<TE>   LaBute's natural coolness actually enhances these scenes, as his
affinity for the delicacy and restraint of the period makes the
characters' passion stand out that much more clearly.</TE>
<TE>   Yet sure as his hand is in the historical segments, LaBute can't
avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era: He's changed the male
academic from a lower-class Brit to an American, a choice that upsets
the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film,
corrupting all of LaBute's good work and robbing it of the impact it
would otherwise have.</TE>
<TE>   Given that the role went to Eckhart, an actor who's been in each
of his previous works, the feeling is inescapable that LaBute
sacrificed the integrity of the piece so he could work with someone
he felt comfortable with--though he claims the actor was not on his
mind when he made the change.</TE>
<TE>   Although fitting a 555-page book into an hour and 42 minutes of
screen time entails a considerable amount of compression as well as
the excising of the novel's philosophical underpinnings, overall,
"Possession" hews to the outline of the book.</TE>
<TE>   Roland Michell (Eckhart) is a scruffy American academic in London
on a research fellowship studying the life and work of the revered
Randolph Henry Ash, the poet laureate to Queen Victoria.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in a library and turning the pages of Ash's personal copy
of a weighty philosophical tome to record the poet's marginalia,
Michell comes across two drafts of a previously unknown and
provocatively intimate letter Ash, celebrated for his marital
fidelity, had written to an unknown woman.</TE>
<TE>   Through some intrepid sleuthing, Michell determines that the
likely recipient of the letter was Christabel LaMotte, a
proto-feminist poet and writer of fairy tales who was also, most
intriguingly of all, a lesbian.</TE>
<TE>   Michell finds this out from the world's foremost authority on
LaMotte, the svelte Dr. Maud Bailey (Paltrow being convincingly
British one more time).</TE>
<TE>   She's a gender studies specialist whose icy hauteur and ivory
cameo good looks make her, in Byatt's words, "a most untouchable
woman."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally these two take an instant dislike to each other,
something that, given Michell's partiality for oafish phrases like
"how's it hanging," make perfect sense from Bailey's point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the American convinces her that the possibility of a
relationship between Ash and LaMotte is worth investigating. If, as
he typically puts it, "Mr. Fidelity had this Shakespearean dark-lady
thing going on," it would astound the academic world. So off they go,
following clues across England and trying to stay ahead of rival
scholars who've gotten a whiff of the same story.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneous with the moderns investigating the past, "Possession"
actually shows us what the Victorians were up to, and these are the
film's best moments. Not only is the period atmosphere, with its
conscious echoes of "The French Lieutenant's Woman," richly
re-created, not only do Northam and Ehle fully inhabit their roles,
but from their first verbal joustings--Ash says "you cut me, madam,"
and she replies, "I'm sorry, I only meant to scratch"--these
characters have all the good lines. Leaving these segments for modern
times is invariably painful.</TE>
<TE>   That's especially the case because Eckhart's fish-out-of-water
persona is such an awkward mistake. His character is too brusque, too
insistently crude, too eager to say things like "I'm sort of a
brush-and-flush kind of guy," to be anything more than a major
irritant. It's as if LaBute couldn't bear to leave well enough alone,
couldn't resist placing an intrusive mark on the proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   This is especially unfortunate because today's couple is, by the
nature of modern life, more whiny and tendentious than the Victorians
and thus less fun to observe.</TE>
<TE>   We can't go back to a time when a glimpse of bare shoulder took
someone's breath away, but both parts of "Possession" will make you
wish that we could.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for sexuality and some thematic elements. Times
guidelines: adult subject matter; the sexuality is more talk than
action.</TE>

<HD>This 'Cardenio' Doesn't Miss Shakespeare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Hamilton, the late Shakespearean scholar, created a storm of
controversy when he seized on an anonymous document at the British
Museum Library and proclaimed it a long-lost work by William
Shakespeare. By Hamilton's reckoning, the play, loosely based on
Cervantes' "Don Quixote," was the apocryphal "Cardenio," a lost
masterpiece supposedly co-written by Shakespeare and his associate
John Fletcher around 1612.</LD>
<LD>   After one views the play, being presented by the Lone Star
Ensemble at 2100 Square Feet, its authorship seems even more
debatable.</LD>
<LD>   An overwrought drama fraught with kinky plot elements and a
B-story that plays like a class project in remedial playwriting,
"Cardenio" is more strikingly bizarre than it is brilliant. If
Shakespeare were indeed involved, his powers were evidently on the
wane.</LD>
<TE>   What is most remarkable about this production is the direction by
James Kerwin, a young innovator who has converted a problematic play
into a crackling entertainment of a most precocious stripe.</TE>
<TE>   Purists beware: Kerwin plays fast and loose with his material,
employing a sophisticated array of mixed media in a staging that is
cinematically fluid. Character's monologues are internalized,
expressed primarily through the beautifully realized video segments
that are incorporated throughout. The second act segues into a
largely extraneous subplot, a comedic interlude with an oddly bloody
climax.</TE>
<TE>   The meat of the play concerns the struggle for power between the
usurper Fernando (Corey Hayes) and his brother Cardenio (Steve
Lipinsky), the rightful heir. Fernando is obsessed with Luscinda
(Megan Henning), Cardenio's love, who kills herself rather than
submit to Fernando's lustful designs. Undeterred, Fernando absconds
with Luscinda's corpse, secreting the body in his private quarters
for his perverse delectation, a sin that must be avenged at last.</TE>
<TE>   This is twisted stuff. Yet Kerwin and his attractive young cast
deftly straddle the fine line between parody and sincerity, only
occasionally slipping into excess. The Lone Star Ensemble is a
vibrant company that bears watching; its "Venus and Adonis" was
well-received last season, and this is another worthy effort.</TE>

<TE>   Fleck's Happy Hour:</TE>
<TE>   Existential Mayhem</TE>
<TE>   In "Nothin' Beats Pussy," playing late-night Saturdays at the
Evidence Room, performance artist John Fleck offers a veritable happy
hour of Dadaist pyrotechnics. Along the way, he reconfirms his genius
at existential mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   At the outset, our body-miked host works the lobby, offering
highballs all around. Using his inherited parental collection of
kitsch recordings as schematic fodder, Fleck's subsequent
direct-address musings carry multiple meanings, starting with the
title.</TE>
<TE>   That ostensibly refers to Fleck's latest persona, a would-be
starlet of sub-Joey Heatherton stature. Her trek to Hollywood
debauchery intersects with Fleck's own flight from Cleveland to
Screenland, with blond ambition, familial requirements and orifice
maintenance the predominant motifs.</TE>
<TE>   Possessing a classical technique tailor-made for the roles
Geoffrey Rush keeps landing, Fleck gambols in jagged immediacy.</TE>
<TE>   He pays attendees cash for their onstage participation. He juggles
low-camp burlesque and Senor Wences-style puppetry to embody Pussy
and her co-star Del Cracker, singing in a manner suggesting the
lovechild of Johnny Ray and Yma Sumac. And when something goes awry,
Fleck incorporates it with unparalleled reflexive speed.</TE>
<TE>   The piece is less conclusive than its creator, transitions still
evolving and the resolution hastily achieved, despite co-director
Randee Trabitz's knowing eye. Still, for demonstrating how to render
life and art indivisible, nothin' beats Fleck.</TE>

<TE>   Revived 'Black Boys' Retains Pain, Urgency</TE>
<TE>   Proud, wounded, defiant or serene, the voices in Keith Antar
Mason's "for black boys who have considered homicide when the streets
were too much" are all saying: Don't define me, much less judge me,
when you haven't tried to understand me.</TE>
<TE>   Written in the spirit of Ntozake Shange's "for colored girls who
have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf," Mason's
assemblage of poetic narratives and dances may be 20 years old, but
it continues to speak with urgency and yearning in a revival at 4305
Village Theatre in Leimert Park.</TE>
<TE>   In America, black men are "just numbers," the piece declares. To
drive home the point, each of the six actors wears a T-shirt
emblazoned with a random number.</TE>
<TE>   In moments of brotherly unity, the performers emphasize Mason's
key statements in an almost musical overlay of echoing voices or give
their bodies over to the throbbing rhythms of funk and jazz.
Separately, they shift through various identities.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these characters cry out in protest: a young man who fears
he's being dismissed as just another statistic as he dies of stab
wounds, or a young professional who, after working late one night,
finds himself in a deserted parking lot surrounded by police, who
assume he committed a nearby rape.</TE>
<TE>   Other characters try to cut through societal assumptions, going so
far as to take black women to task for readily believing the same
stereotypes that everyone else does.</TE>
<TE>   Under William White's direction, the show pulses with life,
surging to reverberant shouts ("I found God in me") and quieting to
moments of introspection. The tremble of sexual awakening, the pain
of feeling marginalized, the peace of being happy with oneself--and
much more--are deftly conveyed by Michael Broughton, Paul Eric
Jerome, Devon Todd, Carlton Wilborn, Jonaton Wyne and Christopher
Hines (who on Sundays is replaced by Evan Reynolds).</TE>
<TE>   Further texture is provided by the live drumming of Dele Adefemi
and the deft dance of light devised by Kathi O'Donohue.</TE>

<TE>   Powerful 'Slavery'</TE>
<TE>   Celebrates Survivors</TE>
<TE>   In the 1930s, the Federal Writers' Project undertook an
indispensable task, conducting interviews with surviving slaves. The
accounts of those former slaves, whose experiences under the
"peculiar institution" ranged from the benign to the horrific, remain
a vital historical testament, filled with humor, pathos and enduring
dread.</TE>
<TE>   As a drama student at Santa Monica College, Jonathan Payne cobbled
those interviews into a play, "Slavery," which received the 2002
Kennedy Center John Cauble Short Play Award for Playwriting. A sort
of "Spoon River" of color, Payne's play is a simply structured piece
consisting of the slaves' personal accounts as monologues, heavily
interspersed with the spirituals and the folk music of the period.
That indigenous music is every bit as evocative as the oral accounts.
The famous hymn "Wade in the Water" takes on chilling new meaning
when one realizes that the words were not only significant of
baptismal cleansing but also covert advice on how to elude a pack of
bloodhounds.</TE>
<TE>   Payne's staging of his own play at the Powerhouse is lucid, clean
and undeniably powerful, even when it veers into the histrionic. This
is foolproof material, the kind of historically riveting stuff that
could command interest if spoken in a monotone.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Payne's performers, including Payne himself,
overstate. A little initial restraint on the part of the ensemble
would help the momentum build to the climactic final scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the prevalent tone of fierceness, mingled with a bracing
dose of jocularity, attests to the remarkable resilience of these
vibrant and unbowed survivors. Despite a few irregularities in the
staging, Payne's poignant piece succeeds as both social document and
drama.</TE>

<TE>   Wrenching Story Is</TE>
<TE>   Only a Family Affair</TE>
<TE>   The autobiographical solo show--those always candid, often comical
confessionals derived from an individual performer's personal
experience--are endemic to the small-theater scene. Always on the
lookout for that ever-elusive dream project, many actors attempt to
craft their own, mining their pasts for dramatic material.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, a particularly artful practitioner will strike dramatic
gold. However, there's an inherent risk in such endeavors. Such
highly personal accounts, however keenly felt and rendered, may not
always make the transition from the genealogical to the general.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the case with "Looking for Louie," Stacie Chaiken's solo
show at Stages. The story primarily concerns her great-grandfather,
Louie, a mysterious figure who disappeared from the family tree
shortly after his emigration from Russia in the early 1900s. Offering
snippets from her own childhood along the way, Chaiken sets out to
trace Louie's fate and uncover a long-suppressed family scandal
associated with her elusive relative.</TE>
<TE>   Chaiken is an ebullient actor with an obvious enthusiasm for her
subject. However, despite Stephanie Shroyer's meticulous direction
and Ian Walker's evocative live cello music, her overly exhaustive
account of a long-ago family trauma seems suspiciously
self-indulgent, a family skeleton that she unearths and rattles to
dubious emotional effect. The whiff of unconscious capriciousness
underlying the tale doesn't help.</TE>
<TE>   Certain passages, as when Chaiken leaves her then-husband without
a note or a word of explanation, may be meant as necessary
background. However, since the marriage itself is so scantily
explored, Chaiken's action seems dangerously off-putting.</TE>
<TE>   So, too, does her relentless badgering of her grandfather for
information regarding his painful past, information she insists on
pursuing even when he begs her to desist.</TE>
<TE>   The video segments in which Chaiken's 96-year-old grandfather
finally reveals the long-kept family secret are genuinely wrenching
and cathartic. For the most part, however, the story, no matter how
well-intentioned and well-told, holds limited appeal for a general
audience. F.K.F.</TE>

<HD>Oh, Sweet Mystery of 'Chocolat'</HD>
<DH>Claude Chabrol is back in his element with a pitch-dark
story of intricate relationships.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When director Claude Chabrol cast Isabelle Huppert in the title role
of his 1978 "Violette," as a notorious real-life teenage killer
leading a double life, he found in her the ideal actress to express
his career-long fascination with how bourgeoise propriety can mask
and distort emotions. Huppert is arguably without parallel among
contemporary international movie stars in her ability to suggest,
with the utmost subtlety, rage and conflict roiling beneath the most
composed and controlled demeanor.</LD>
<LD>   The two have teamed many times since, and now with "Merci Pour le
Chocolat" they've come up with one of their best, a pitch-dark comedy
of manners that builds to a tragic revelation. In his 48th film of
his 44-year career, New Wave pioneer Chabrol remains at the height of
his powers.</LD>
<LD>   Working from Charlotte Armstrong's "The Chocolate Cobweb," Chabrol
opens with a pair of amusing multi-character set pieces that convey a
wealth of exposition. In lesser hands, all this information could be
confusing but here plays with brisk humor, while also introducing an
unsettling note. The first scene is a civil wedding somewhere in
Switzerland between Mika Muller (Huppert), a chocolate heiress, and
Andre Polonski (Jacques Dutronc), a renowned concert pianist.</LD>
<TE>   At the reception, we learn that the couple had been married
briefly years before, and that Andre's second wife, Lisbeth, had been
one of Mika's closest friends but was killed in a car accident eight
years ago. For three years, Mika and Andre have been living together
in Mika's hilltop estate, a formidable 19th century stone mansion
with contemporary interior decoration in perfect but blandly
impersonal taste, which also characterizes Mika's well-tailored
wardrobe. Guillaume (Rodolphe Pauly), Andre and Lisbeth's 18-year-old
son, is currently home on a school vacation.</TE>
<TE>   At a restaurant, meanwhile, we meet several more people chatting
over lunch. A friend of Dr. Louise Pollet (Brigitte Catillon), the
widowed head of a forensic research lab, goes on about the
Muller-Polonski remarriage, and then indiscreetly remarks that
Guillaume and Dr. Pollet's daughter Jeanne (Anna Mouglalis), born the
same day in the same hospital, may have been accidentally switched at
birth. Dr. Pollet insists the confusion was swiftly dispelled, but
Jeanne is all ears, as this is news to her. A headstrong beauty,
Jeanne happens to be an aspiring concert pianist, and she can't
resist seeking out Andre Polonski.</TE>
<TE>   Chabrol has now neatly set his story in motion. Andre also
pooh-poohs the switched-at-birth rumor but is enchanted by Jeanne,
who does, however, remind him of Lisbeth. Mika goes out of her way to
welcome Jeanne, who soon is being coached by Andre for a major
competition in Budapest. As preoccupied as Jeanne is, she is also
keenly aware of her surroundings. Disturbed by witnessing a thermos
of hot chocolate being deliberately spilled, she has the handkerchief
she stained in helping mop up the beverage analyzed by her boyfriend,
Axel (Mathieu Simonet), who has just gone to work at her mother's
lab. It contains a sizable amount of the drug favored by date
rapists.</TE>
<TE>   For quite some time the suspect's motivations seem as obvious as
the suspect's identity. But Chabrol as always goes way beyond genre
and its expectations. The mystery that concerns him is not in the
unraveling of a well-populated, complicated plot, but how it reveals
the mystery of the workings of the human heart and how an unthinking
adherence to convention can perversely twist the human psyche.</TE>
<TE>   Key here is the parent-child relationship and how it shapes an
individual's destiny, and how a biological connection can pale beside
a loving, nurturing parental bond; sociopaths, Chabrol suspects, are
more likely to be the result of nurture rather than nature.
(Interestingly, Chabrol's co-writer, Caroline Eliacheff, is a child
psychiatrist.)</TE>
<TE>   Huppert heads an impeccable ensemble cast that includes the
delightful veteran Swiss comedian Michel Robin. Once again Chabrol's
son Mathieu has composed a crucially evocative score, and Renato
Berta's cinematography is gleaming. "Merci Pour le Chocolat" crackles
with wit and elegance, humor and pathos.</TE>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filmmaker Jay Anania is fearless before the pitfalls of the arty and
the pretentious. When his "Long Time Since" starts grabbing attention
and holding it like glue, it becomes clear that his highly stylized
approach is paying off. A rigorously minimalist work, it befits a
woman who lives a most austere existence.</LD>
<LD>   When we meet Paulina Porizkova's Diane Thwaite, she surely is
little more than 16. Driving alone at night on a country road on New
Year's Eve 1972, just as "Auld Lang Syne" comes over the radio, her
car hits something. Swerving to a stop, she gets out, and the next
thing she knows she is awakened by a concerned passing trucker.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's 1996, and Diane is a botanical illustrator with a starkly
chic New York apartment. The severity of clothes sets off her regal
blond beauty, and she pursues a highly circumscribed, ordered
existence. She keeps the man in her life, Cyril (Jeff Webster), at a
distance. She had forgotten the incident 24 years earlier, when a
chance hearing of the very same version of "Auld Lang Syne" that
played on the car radio so long ago triggers a series of increasingly
ominous memory fragments.</LD>
<TE>   Without giving away the plot, a key element in Diane's memory
involves a baby girl. Diane's life is transformed as she begins her
search for that fully grown woman and an investigation of the
circumstances surrounding the infant's earlier fate. Diane is too
quickly caught up in playing detective to bother with her job or
Cyril. She has come alive, and she's on a quest, although ultimately
it seems logical that she has really commenced a search for herself.
In the meantime, Anania has cut away from Diane to an unidentified
man (Julian Sands), who has striking blond looks similar to Diane's
and who, intriguingly, seems to live as solitary and marginal an
existence as she.</TE>
<TE>   "Long Time Since" has the look of a film made by a photographer,
for its shots are dramatically composed and cropped, and feature lots
of close-ups. The film moves as gracefully as Porizkova but also as
economically. Cinematographer Oliver Bokelberg's shots tend to be
very tight; at no time do we see anything more than is absolutely
necessary. There is not the slightest waste of time or space on the
screen, and this rigor works very well as curiosity and suspense
start to build.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, the film's few actors respond to Anania's
relentlessly disciplined approach. Nothing really turns out as Diane
hopes, but Porizkova shows us a woman flowering as radiantly as one
of those plants she draws so exquisitely. Sands and Webster in
support are just as impressive, as is Marianne Quinn as a waitress.
Porizkova and Sands seem too young for their roles, but then the film
seems as timeless as a fable.</TE>
<TE>   Anania has determinedly told his story in images with a minimum of
words, and the resulting tension pays off. The beauty of those images
has a poetic quality, and "Long Time Since" is even able to sustain
some spare and portentous music--piano solos, flute solos typical of
moody, evocative Japanese art films, plus flourishes of exotic,
tinkling Asian temple bells. It's hard to imagine Anania telling a
story in quite this same studied way again, but here it works better
than ever could be imagined in its early sequences that in fact do
suggest something merely arty and pretentious in the offing.</TE>

<LD>If the talk-show interview is an art, Graham Norton is an abstract
expressionist.</LD>
<LD>   One night, Dolly Parton is sitting across from the host of "So
Graham Norton," which airs weeknights at 8 and 11 on BBC America,
chatting about a song as she would with Leno or Letterman. But not
for long.</LD>
<LD>   Norton turns to the desk behind him, clicks on a Web page of
Parton impersonators and asks her to evaluate their appearance. He
rings one on the Doggy Phone--a stuffed animal-telephone combination
that moves as the call recipient speaks and that on this night is
dressed up in a blond wig and falsies--and has the fake Dolly
unknowingly evaluate the real one's accent.</LD>
<TE>   Then out comes the Teddy Phone--you guessed it, a teddy
bear--dressed in a gray Kenny Rogers wig and Western wear, and soon a
Rogers impersonator is on the line singing a duet with the Parton
impersonator, as the singer herself joins in.</TE>
<TE>   Do not adjust your television set. It is just one element of the
outrageous, randy series that is a hit on Britain's Channel 4.</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, the Irish-born Norton isn't much different from
his U.S. predecessors. For one, he mines humorous stories from the
studio audience, except here the tales usually focus on sex,
preferably involving a public place or costumes.</TE>
<TE>   Norton, however, possesses a style all his own, frequently drawing
on his flamboyance and homosexuality for jokes. His guests range from
David Hasselhoff and Joan Rivers to Cher, Elton John and Gerard
Depardieu. (Tonight's are Brenda Blethyn and BBC personality Gloria
Hunniford.) No matter how big the stars, they must endure Norton's
offbeat Web surfing and phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   As enjoyable as it can be, BBC America has been repeating the
half-hour shows so much that what initially comes across as
shamefully funny acquires a hollow ring by the second or third
viewing. Fortunately, new hourlong episodes will premiere starting
Sept. 2.</TE>

<HD>'Blue Crush' Tries to Catch a Wave</HD>
<DH>Although the surfing is gnarly, conflicting constraints
cause the female underdog-themed film to lose its balance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is what I learned while watching "Blue Crush," which defiantly
describes itself as "Not your parents' idea of a surf movie":</LD>
<LD>   * "Baywatch Barbie" is not a term of endearment;</LD>
<LD>   * "pipe" is more than something plumbers fool around with;</LD>
<TE>   * when Hawaiian locals yell, "we grew here, you flew here," they
are not trying to be friendly;</TE>
<TE>   * running on the ocean floor holding a giant boulder is a fine way
to build stamina;</TE>
<TE>   * the venerable "I had no idea you were in the bathroom stall
listening to every nasty thing I said" plot ploy is far from dead;</TE>
<TE>   * real female professional surfers (several make cameo appearances
in addition to working as stunt doubles) look a lot tougher than the
film's trio of stars.</TE>
<TE>   That may not seem like a lot of knowledge, but it's more than one
might expect from "Blue Crush," the kind of movie that's not five
minutes old before you know what the last five minutes are going to
be like.</TE>
<TE>   Here's plucky surfer Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), training hard for
the Pipe Masters competition on Oahu, doing her early-morning
roadwork and writing things like "Train Hard! Go Big!" in red
lipstick on her bathroom mirror.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Marie may be young, she may have all kinds of obstacles to
face (more about them later), she may live in a leaky beach shack and
have less disposable income than anyone in the audience, but by God
something tells us that a disaster in the Masters--just one week
away!--is not in the cards for this spunky individual.</TE>
<TE>   Though they don't win critics awards, films like "Blue Crush" can
be entertaining when they're done right. Who doesn't want to root for
determined, not to mention attractive, underdogs who laugh at the
odds as they follow a cherished dream. Think "Rocky," think "The
Rookie," think "Girlfight" but don't think "Blue Crush." At least not
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   For although director John Stockwell (who did the more successful
"crazy/beautiful") and his co-writer Lizzy Weiss do it right some of
the time, "Blue Crush" ultimately gets away from them. Way longer
than it needs to be, overloaded with increasingly strained
contrivances, it's a film that feels as if it outsmarted itself by
listening to too many "what if" ideas from too many story
conferences.</TE>
<TE>   "Blue Crush" starts promisingly enough, with Anne Marie sharing
her shack with feisty but supportive pals Eden ("Girlfight's"
Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) plus unruly younger sister
Penny (Mika Boorem), whom Anne Marie's been raising since their
mother took off for reasons unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from worrying about Penny partying too hard to do her
homework, aside from jeopardizing her job as part of a luxury hotel's
housekeeping staff by chronically showing up late, Anne Marie has
another problem even her friends don't know about. She still gets
recurrent nightmares dating from a near-drowning accident three years
earlier, an incident that temporarily derailed her surfing career.
With the Pipe Masters just days (days!) away, this is not a good
thing.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating her life, but in a more photogenic way, is
the connection Anne Marie makes with Matt (Matthew Davis, Reese
Witherspoon's flame in "Legally Blonde"), the cutest quarterback in
the NFL. He's in town for the Pro Bowl and is soon soliciting the
kind of lessons, surfing and otherwise, only Anne Marie can provide.
Can she manage Matt and the Masters, all at the same time?</TE>
<TE>   Acceptable in general outline, and helped by excellent surfing
footage, "Blue Crush" nevertheless can't seem to sustain any
momentum. A lot of what happens on screen plays like marking time
until the conclusion, and even that doesn't play out in an optimal
way.</TE>
<TE>   One difficulty is that "Blue Crush" is operating under too many
conflicting constraints. You can't have a hot guy in the picture and
not have him help out, but how much help can he provide in an
avowedly "girls doing it on their own" piece of work?
Tradition-minded moviegoers will want Anne Marie to succeed, but is
that in conflict with the film's "not your parents' idea of a surf
movie" modernism?</TE>
<TE>   In attempting to serve all these different constituencies, "Blue
Crush" overcomplicates its plot and spends a lot of time floundering
around in the shallow end. Maybe your parents' surf movie wasn't such
a bad thing after all.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for sexual content, teen partying, language
and a fight. Times guidelines: jokes about condoms and unsanitary
bathrooms but otherwise fairly clean-cut.</TE>

<HD>'Hairspray' Wraps Up Bad Taste in a Big Heart</HD>
<DH>The Broadway version of the John Waters cult film is a
high-energy spoof that benefits greatly from Harvey Fierstein's
performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA WINER</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--The most unlikely, most romantic moment on Broadway
comes--no, it floats--into theater history some time after
intermission at the Neil Simon Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Edna, who describes herself as a "simple housewife of
indeterminate girth," has the voice of Beelzebub of Brooklyn, bosoms
the size of her bouffant and a bouffant the size of her husband.
Wilbur, who owns a small joke store, wears his pants up to his
armpits and the sweet smile of failure. But when they dance, ah, when
they dance, they are suddenly more Fred and Ginger than Fred and
Ethel. She compares him to rare vintage Ripple, he says she's a
stinky old cheese and they pledge "the fact we ain't dead yet" in a
duet that, against all odds, transports us to a blood-pounding
sanctuary of deep, lasting love.</LD>
<LD>   In such a moment, "Hairspray," which opened Thursday night after
enough hype to power a nuclear sub, lifts the $10.5-million
adaptation of John Waters' bad-taste, good-values 1988 cult film into
the must-see zone of transcendence. In fact, every time Harvey
Fierstein's magnificent mountain-mama Edna tosses off a droll aside,
admits an insecurity or puffs up with pride over her adoring husband
(Dick Latessa) or her spunky, "big-boned" teenage daughter, the level
of satire, artistry and humanity rises in the world.</LD>
<TE>   Otherwise, "Hairspray" is a cheerful, good-natured cartoon with a
first-rate cast and a big-budget 1962 tacky look. The show is not
always as interesting or funny as it pretends. But it is a
high-energy spoof within a spoof within a big-hearted message about
the triumph of black people, fat people and, by extension, outsiders
of all worthy persuasions. Any comparison with "The Producers" is
wishful thinking. On the other hand, there is no shame in the winking
candyland-pop tradition of "Bye, Bye, Birdie" and "Grease."</TE>
<TE>   Director Jack O'Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell are far
more joyfully faithful to the spirit of the original than they were
in their strangely charmless hit adaptation of "The Full Monty."
Authors Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan (Mel Brooks' collaborator on
"Producers") have kept much of Waters' best wisecracks and his story
about Tracy Turnblad, a hefty white Baltimore teen (gutsy newcomer
Marissa Jaret Winokur) who gets picked as a regular on the local
version of "American Bandstand." She also wins the love of the most
desirable boy, incites a race riot to bring integrated dancing and
respect for "colored music" to a show that formerly boasted a single
"Negro Day" a month.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Shaiman has written a cavalcade of catchy faux-early rock 'n'
roll numbers for the white people, some very sly rhythm and blues for
the blacks. It is hard not to miss the real hit songs used in the
film. But Shaiman and co-lyricist Scott Wittman do reach beyond their
opening number, "Good Morning Baltimore," to music that combines
girls' group nubile innocence with borderline insolence.</TE>
<TE>   The results are innocuous and a little subversive. There are so
many noble pronouncements against jokes about overweight people that
the show comes close to being one big fat joke disguised as progress.</TE>
<TE>   Winokur jumps confidently into Ricki Lake's wide shoes. She has a
big expressive voice and a decent enough dance technique and, though
her Tracy tends to be a one-note heroine, the note has gusto.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Morrison deftly combines James Dean's cool and a
Mouseketeer's heart as Link Larkin, who loves Tracy for herself. His
counterpart in the black neighborhood, Seaweed, is played with
knowing style by Corey Reynolds. Kerry Butler is aptly adorable as
Tracy's shy but worthy friend, Penny. Jackie Hoffman descends to
audience-pandering as the lesbian gym teacher and prison matron.
Linda Hart and Laura Bell Bundy have fun playing the white
establishment's version of Cruella DeVil and daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Fierstein is back on Broadway for the first time since his
barrier-breaking "Torch Song Trilogy" in 1983. As Tracy's mom, he
wears stenciled eyebrows--a homage to the late Divine?--and fills out
more than a fat suit in William Ivey Long's body-perfect costumes.
Fierstein gets the best lines, but he also finds the layers of real
humanity beneath the attitude.</TE>
<TE>   The hairstyles could make Marie Antoinette want to go into show
business. David Rockwell's sets are not as memorably outrageous as
his extravaganza for "The Rocky Horror Show," but they have a
fantasyland bad tastefulness. It helps to remember that these were
the awkward years between the '50s and the hippies.</TE>
<TE>   This show celebrates hairspray, but some of us were waiting for
"Hair."</TE>

<HD>Auto Dealers Score Higher With Buyers</HD>
<DH>Cars: Less negotiation, lower prices are the biggest
factors in J.D. Power's consumer satisfaction ranking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A flood of incentives that are keeping new-car costs low and speeding
the buying process has helped boost consumers' satisfaction with
their dealership experiences to new highs this year.</LD>
<LD>   The finding in the widely watched J.D. Power &amp; Associates annual
sales satisfaction study, released Thursday, is supported by other
sales studies.</LD>
<LD>   "Scores have been moving up pretty steadily for the past decade,"
said George Peterson, president of AutoPacific Inc., an automotive
research and consulting firm in Tustin. "Most of the manufacturers
have got religion and have been training and coercing their dealers
to improve the way they handle customers."</LD>
<TE>   The car shopper's sales experience is based on a number of items,
including the cleanliness of a dealership's restrooms. But it is
made--or broken--during price negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything you can do to speed up negotiations, to give your
customers honest information and to speed them through the purchase
process will help your satisfaction scores," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   With its minimal negotiating process, General Motors Corp.'s
mainline Saturn brand captured the top spot in the Power study, its
third consecutive No. 1 placing for customer satisfaction with the
purchase process. This year's top score of 886 points was off
slightly from 887 last year. The industry average of 839 points was
up after stagnating at 835 for the previous two years.</TE>
<TE>   Saturn dealers have exclusive territories and don't stray from the
posted manufacturer's suggested retail price. That means they don't
have to compete with one another. And they don't have customers
worrying about getting a better price at another Saturn dealership
and thus don't have to pressure shoppers to "buy now or else," said
Steve Witten, senior director of automotive research at Westlake
Village-based J.D. Power.</TE>
<TE>   And though luxury and upscale brands from domestic and import auto
makers dominate the list of top scorers--after middle-of-the-road
Saturn's first-place finish--blue-collar brands Ford and GM's
Chevrolet also finished above the industry average.</TE>
<TE>   "It reflects the Big Three's extreme push to clean up their
dealers' acts," said David Healey, auto industry analyst for Burnham
Securities Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Among domestics, only Dodge and Jeep fell below the industry
average in the Power study.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "the domestics aren't necessarily getting a lot better
while others aren't," Witten said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is benefiting from all the incentives, and that has made
all the scores go up."</TE>
<TE>   There's no clear correlation, though, between sales satisfaction
and increased sales volume. Three mainstream import car makers that
have been logging major market share gains in the U.S.--Toyota Motor
Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. all failed to place above
the industry average in the last few Power sales studies.</TE>
<TE>   Their poor showing has as much to do with the brands' popularity
as with the often high-pressure sales environment their customers
must put up with, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   It was customer dissatisfaction with price and the time it took to
get vehicles that caused Nissan's Infiniti luxury brand and Ford
Motor Co.'s Land Rover sport utility brand to tumble in this year's
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Infiniti fell from fourth place last year to 10th place this year,
and Land Rover dropped to 16th place from ninth last year.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, Ford's Lincoln brand rose to third place from sixth
place last year and 16th place in 1999, largely on the strength of a
concerted effort by Lincoln to improve every aspect of its sales
process.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it centers on training of employees, how they dress, how
well they know the product--and competitor's products--the look and
feel of the facilities and improving the processes of delivering the
car, speeding up the paperwork and providing a car that is clean,
gassed and ready to go," said John Csernotta, manager of Lincoln and
Mercury dealership certification programs.</TE>

<HD>SEC Awash in Deluge of Certifications</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission continued to scramble Thursday
to deal with the rush of sworn statements by executives certifying
their companies' earnings, as required by an SEC edict.</LD>
<LD>   "We're back into the paper age, with all its chaos," said SEC
spokesman John Heine in Washington, when asked why a number of
companies that said they filed their certifications had not been
listed as such on the agency's Web site at midday Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   By 5:30 EDT Wednesday, chief executives and chief financial
officers of about 700 companies each with more than $1.2 billion in
revenue had to file statements that their latest quarterly and annual
reports were accurate. Another 250 companies faced filing deadlines
later this year.</LD>
<TE>   A check of the SEC's Web site (www.sec.gov) Thursday evening
showed that only about a dozen companies that had been required to
file by Wednesday weren't listed as having done so. However, Heine
said it may take a few days for the site to be completely updated.</TE>
<TE>   Firms had until 5:30 p.m. on Thursday to ask for a five-day
extension, but there was no one at the SEC keeping track of how many
companies had made such a request, Heine said. One was chemical firm
Hercules Inc., which said it needed more time to check accounting
related to a divestiture.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, speaking in Denver, said he
viewed the certification deadline as a turning point in the corporate
accountability crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I frankly cannot imagine that anybody filed any of those papers
without careful consideration from their financial people and their
lawyers and their spouses. I don't think there were any casual
signatures," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   He conceded that some CEOs are not happy about their increased
liability for the accuracy of their firms' financial statements.
"They're not sure it's fair," he said.</TE>

<HD>Target's Profit Up 27% on Strong Sales</HD>
<DH>Earnings: It exceeds expectations by a penny a share.
Discount retailer Kohl's also posts a rise in the second quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Target Corp. on Thursday reported a 27% jump in second-quarter
earnings, powered by strong sales and profit growth at its namesake
stores as consumers sought bargains in the slumping economy.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, Kohl's Corp. posted a 44% rise in second-quarter
profit as the value-priced retailer expanded and consumers looked for
discounts.</LD>
<LD>   Target, whose chains also include Mervyn's and Marshall Fields,
beat Wall Street expectations by a penny a share, with earnings of
$344 million, or 38 cents, for the quarter ended Aug. 3. That
compared with $271 million, or 30 cents, a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   The Minneapolis-based company reiterated its third-and
fourth-quarter profit goals, but said during its conference call that
if the recent weak sales trend continues, its third-quarter
projection could "be at risk."</TE>
<TE>   The retailer, whose Target stores are known for carrying trendy
yet inexpensive clothing and housewares, said its unique products and
"intense focus on inventory management" helped it to deliver such a
strong quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Target's revenue rose 13% to $10.07 billion, driven by a 16%
increase in the Target division. Revenue from its Target credit card
arm surged 89% to $277 million. The company has been upgrading
holders of its private credit card to a Target Visa card that can be
used at other retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at stores open at least one year rose 4.4% at Target Stores,
but fell 5.1% at Mervyn's and 2.5% at Marshall Field's. Total
same-store sales were up 3%.</TE>
<TE>   Target said that given a reasonable sales performance, it should
meet Wall Street's estimate of 31 cents a share for the third
quarter, but said that if the "softer sales trends" continue, the
results could turn out to be a penny or two short.</TE>
<TE>   The company expects to meet analysts' projection of 77 cents for
the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Target's earnings report comes a week after it reported same-store
sales that were below plan for July. July is normally a transitional
month before back-to-school selling heats up, so sales in the coming
months will be more meaningful for Target.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's posted net income of $124.4 million, or 36 cents a share,
for the quarter ended Aug. 3, up from $86.5 million, or 25 cents, a
year ago. Analysts on average were expecting 34 cents, according to
Thomson First Call. Sales jumped 27% to $1.9 billion, while
same-store sales climbed 10.6%.</TE>
<TE>   The 420-store chain has been luring customers fromdiscounters and
traditional department stores by offering brand-name items, including
Dockers, Levi's and Osh Kosh, at discount prices.</TE>
<TE>   Kohl's plans to open 33 more stores this year, mostly in the
Midwest. It plans to enter the Los Angeles market next year.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Target rose $2.21, or 7%, to
$34.38, while Menomonee, Wis.-based Kohl's rose $2.91, or 4%, to
$71.66.</TE>

<HD>Pair Claim Arbitration Delays</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Two California state senators filed a formal complaint against the
New York Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers
on Thursday, claiming both are stalling arbitration claims of
California investors.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic Sens. John Burton and Martha Escutia said in a letter
to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt that the
NYSE and NASD have delayed those proceedings as retaliation for
California's tougher ethics standards for arbitrators.</LD>
<LD>   The NYSE and the NASD have refused to proceed with new arbitration
cases of investor claims in California since July 1, when the new
ethics policies were enacted, Burton and Escutia said.</LD>
<TE>   The lawmakers said the delay was an "illegal and a misguided
retaliatory action against the California Judicial Council's new
arbitrator ethics standards requiring disclosures of conflicts of
interest."</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage contracts generally require that investor complaints be
handled by arbitration, and the NASD, which regulates brokerage
firms, handles roughly 90% of cases that go through that process,
said NASD spokesman Mike Shokouhi.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE also handles arbitration cases.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD "appreciates Sen. Escutia's concerns and will continue to
talk with her, as we have done in the past," said spokeswoman Nancy
Condon.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups sued the California Judicial Council over its new
ethics standards, saying they shouldn't apply in securities disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Christiaan Brackman, spokesman for the NYSE, said the exchange had
just received a copy of the senators' complaint and didn't have a
comment.</TE>

<HD>Gap 2nd-Quarter Earnings Decline 37%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gap Inc., the largest U.S. specialty apparel retailer, reported a
decline in second-quarter earnings Thursday and said August sales
were tracking below its projections.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company, which includes the Gap, Banana
Republic and Old Navy retail chains, reported profit of $57 million,
or 6 cents a share, in the quarter ended Aug. 3, down 37% from $90
million, or 10 cents, in the same period a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   The results were a penny above the consensus estimate of analysts
polled by Thomson First Call. Gap last week said it expected to
report earnings of 4 cents to 5 cents.</LD>
<TE>   Sales edged up 1% to $3.27 billion, Gap said. In a more telling
illustration of the retailer's problems, sales at stores open for at
least a year declined 7%, with decreases in all divisions.</TE>
<TE>   Gap kept inventories extremely low as it prepared to unveil a
merchandising strategy focused on basic apparel. The company has
chalked up 28 straight monthly same-store sales declines.</TE>
<TE>   Although expressing confidence about its autumn clothing
selection, Gap management Thursday dashed hopes for better times by
revealing that its sales during the first two weeks of the third
quarter are running "somewhat short of projections."</TE>
<TE>   To drum up more customer traffic, the company said all its major
store chains will cut prices and offer other sales promotions during
the rest of August.</TE>
<TE>   Gap also is pinning its hopes on a national TV advertising
campaign that was scheduled to debut Thursday and continue through
mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   If customers come to the stores, Chief Executive Millard "Mickey"
Drexler predicted they will find reasons to return.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel good about our stores, and our customers tell us they
like what they see," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gap made its announcement after the stock market closed Thursday.
After rising 54 cents to $13 on the New York Stock Exchange, Gap's
shares fell 25 cents in after-hours trading.</TE>

<HD>Regulators Fine and Suspend Two Executives at CSFB</HD>
<DH>Brokerages: Penalties mark latest development in probes
into whether firms inflated fees for IPO shares in tech boom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Securities regulators fined and suspended two senior executives at
brokerage Credit Suisse First Boston on Thursday for their roles in a
scandal involving initial public stock offerings in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   The penalties mark the latest development in regulators' probes
into whether Wall Street firms charged improper fees for IPO shares
during the tech-stock boom. Authorities are investigating whether
brokerages sought a piece of their customers' often-huge IPO profits
by charging kickbacks in the form of excessive commissions.</LD>
<LD>   The National Assn. of Securities Dealers suspended for 60 days J.
Anthony Ehinger, CSFB's global head of equity sales, and George W.
Coleman, its chief of institutional listed sales trading. Each man
also was fined $200,000.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this year, CSFB agreed to pay $100 million to settle NASD
and Securities and Exchange Commission charges that the firm had
mishandled IPOs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Justice Department last year dropped a criminal probe
of CSFB's IPO business, Congress has shown intense interest in other
IPO matters. Congressional investigators have been studying whether
Salomon Smith Barney sought to lure investment banking business by
doling out hot IPOs to telecom executives.</TE>
<TE>   The IPO probes have triggered an avalanche of lawsuits from
individual investors charging that investment banks intentionally
manipulated the IPO market to boost their profits. As a result, the
suits allege, small investors paid artificially high prices for
stocks only to watch them crash when the technology stock bubble
burst.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Thursday, the NASD fined and suspended four former San
Francisco CSFB employees for not giving timely assistance in the
probe. Penalties were levied against Scott M. Brown, Richard S.
Bushley, Michael S. Grunwald and John E. Schmidt. Each was fined
$30,000 and suspended from the industry for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD charged that Ehinger and Coleman failed to prevent
employees in their departments from overcharging customers in
thousands of transactions.</TE>
<TE>   The two men created a system that compared customer IPO profits
with the commissions they paid for shares, according to the NASD.
They dubbed the system the New Issue Performance Report. When IPO
profits were deemed to be high in relation to the fees, the two men
and their subordinates would "encourage" clients to pay higher
commissions, the NASD said.</TE>
<TE>   Ehinger and Coleman told underlings they wanted some clients to
fork over commissions totaling one-third of their IPO earnings, the
NASD said.</TE>
<TE>   A statement issued by lawyers for Ehinger and Coleman said their
case "raised enormously complicated and novel legal questions" and
said the men thought it "in the best interests of all concerned to
resolve the case without admitting or denying" guilt.</TE>
<TE>   CSFB said in a statement that it had taken "internal disciplinary
action" against employees involved in the IPO situation. The firm
reportedly fined each man $500,000 earlier this year. Both men will
return to their former jobs after the suspensions, according to a
person familiar with the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The NASD said Ehinger and Coleman asked CSFB's legal department if
they could accept high commissions, but did not detail for lawyers
the magnitude of the fees.</TE>
<TE>   As for the separate NASD action against the four former employees,
Richard Marmaro, an attorney representing Schmidt, said the absence
of NASD charges tied to IPO-specific issues was "vindication that
[Schmidt] had done nothing wrong in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt and Grunwald both have sued CSFB, alleging that the firm
fired them last year to deflect criticism of itself. CSFB says the
charges have no merit.</TE>

<LD>Flush with earnings from surprise hit "Monster's Ball," Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp. reported a fiscal first-quarter profit Wednesday

double revenue from a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The Vancouver, Canada-based film and television producer and

for the quarter ended June 30, contrasted with a loss of $335,000, or
3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $94.2 million from
$45.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   " 'Monster's Ball' is the story," said Lions Gate Chief Executive
Jon Feltheimer.</LD>
<TE>   Motion picture group revenue rose 130% from a year earlier to
$69.5 million. The film generated $24.3 million in video revenue
during the quarter and has become the most profitable movie in the
company's history.</TE>
<TE>   Television revenue grew to $12.2 million from $8.7 million a year
earlier as the company began delivering "The Dead Zone" to USA
Network. The studio facilities division also saw revenue grow to $1.4
million from $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Lions Gate shares fell 2 cents to close at $2.35 on the American

<HD>Late Rally Buoys Stocks</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Despite anemic economic reports, blue chips
and broader indexes climb. Analysts say investors still are wary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A late surge of buying lifted blue-chip shares to a second straight
winning session Thursday, despite more disappointing economic news
and profit taking following the market's big rally the day before.
The Dow Jones industrials had their highest close in more than five
weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The gains came gradually, however, and solidified only in the
final hour of trading. Analysts said investors, still wary after two
years of bear markets, remained hesitant about making many big moves.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow closed up 74.83 points, or 0.9%, at 8,818.14 for a two-day
advance of 335.75 points. It was the average's highest close since
July 9, when the Dow stood at 9,096.09.</LD>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators also rose. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index advanced 10.63 points, or 1.2%, to 930.25, while the Nasdaq
composite index gained 10.71 points, or 0.8%, to 1,345.01.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by more than 3 to 2 on the New York Stock
Exchange, but were about even on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The advance came a day after a sizable rally on news that most of
the nation's largest companies had complied with the Securities and
Exchange Commission deadline to certify their financial statements.</TE>
<TE>   Investors appeared reassured by the relative ease of the process,
but analysts were hesitant to ascribe too much to the market's
two-day winning streak. They said that although investor sentiment
has improved from a few months ago, when it seemed as if there was a
new corporate scandal every day, market conditions remain fragile.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a very reasonable negative case to be made against
equities starting with valuation, continuing on to the risk of a
prolonged period of economic softness and the risk that we may even
be heading into a deflationary period of time that's typically
corrosive to profits," said Charles G. Crane, strategist for Victory
SBSF Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Labor Department reported Thursday that new claims for
jobless benefits rose more than expected last week, and a Federal
Reserve study found that the nation's industrial sector lagged in
July. A separate regional survey from the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve showed a drop-off in spending and manufacturing activity.</TE>
<TE>   "There's little doubt there is economic weakness," said Barry
Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "The
only unknown is if this is going to turn into a double-dip
recession."</TE>
<TE>   The anemic economic reports encouraged currency traders to push
the dollar lower against the euro and the Japanese yen.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   *  Yields on Treasury securities rose on speculation the rally
that sent five-and 10-year yields to four-decade lows this week has
run its course. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 4.18%
from 4.12% on Wednesday. "It's tough to find a buyer of bonds at
these levels," Gary Pzegeo, fixed-income manager at Gannett Welsh &amp;
Kotler, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   *  Oil rose 91 cents to $29.06 a barrel in New York trading--its
first close above $29 in three months. Oil company shares climbed,
with Exxon Mobil gaining 75 cents to $37.14 and ChevronTexaco adding
45 cents to $77.85.</TE>
<TE>   *  Among retailers, Target advanced $2.93 to $35.10 on a 27%
increase in second-quarter earnings, and Nordstrom surged $2.18 to
$20.62 on better-than-expected quarterly results.</TE>
<TE>   *  AOL Time Warner advanced 81 cents to $11.86 despite announcing
late Wednesday that there may be accounting problems at its America
Online unit.</TE>
<TE>   *  Overseas markets rallied strongly on the heels of Wall Street's
big advance on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 1.6% while
key share indexes rose 2.1% in Germany, 3.8% in Britain and 4.1% in
France.</TE>

<HD>Universal Slashes Promoters' Fees by 50%</HD>
<DH>Music: The action comes as lawmakers try to determine
whether payola laws were broken.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal Music Group, the world's largest music company, this week
slashed fees paid to independent record promoters by half--a radical
move that could save the company nearly $25 million a year and pave
the way for other record giants to follow suit.</LD>
<LD>   The action by Universal Music, owned by media conglomerate Vivendi
Universal, comes as lawmakers and federal agencies are trying to
determine whether current independent promotion tactics violate
payola laws, which bar radio stations from playing songs in exchange
for money or anything valuable without identifying the transaction.</LD>
<LD>   Independent promoters typically charge record labels to pitch
their songs to broadcasters in hopes of getting radio airplay. The
practice was invented to insulate record labels from making direct
payments to stations but still allow companies to influence airplay.</LD>
<TE>   Record companies have complained to the Federal Communications
Commission and lawmakers about giant radio conglomerates using their
muscle to ratchet up promotion prices. Sources said Universal Music
Group--which consists of the Interscope, Def Jam, MCA, Universal
Records and Lost Highway labels--pays more than $50 million annually
to independent promoters to pitch songs by such stars as No Doubt,
Ashante, Mary J. Blige and Nellie to radio stations.</TE>
<TE>   Universal declined to comment. But sources at the company said its
labels notified promoters Tuesday that they are slashing promotion
payments 50% to about $200,000 a song. Universal's labels also plan
to reduce the number of radio stations nationwide for which promoters
will be able to collect fees for pitching their songs, sources said.</TE>

its smallest gain since April.</LD>
<LD>   That even this small gain was driven chiefly by the automotive

<LD>Dynegy Inc., which claimed a major Enron Corp. pipeline after their
failed merger attempt last year, warns it might follow its rival into
bankruptcy protection if a pending sale of that pipeline snags.</LD>
<LD>   The firm expects the planned $928-million sale of Northern Natural
Gas pipeline to MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. to be completed this
month.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Dynegy has agreed to pay rival Enron $25 million
for backing out of a merger between the Houston-based energy
marketers.</LD>
<TE>   Under the settlement, Enron has agreed to release Dynegy from all
claims related to the terminated merger. Enron's bankruptcy judge in
New York must approve the terms.</TE>
<TE>   Dynegy's shares fell 19 cents, or 13%, to $1.30 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. may keep selling a low-cost
version of Relafen after a U.S. appeals court upheld a ruling that
invalidated a GlaxoSmithKline patent on the anti-inflammatory drug.</LD>
<LD>   Teva began selling a generic version of the drug, which generated
$265 million a year for Middlesex, England-based Glaxo, in August
2001, after a federal judge invalidated the patent for the drug's
active ingredient, nabumetone.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said the judge
correctly ruled that the name and chemical composition of nabumetone
were revealed in a 1973 article, almost a decade before Glaxo
predecessor SmithKline Beecham sought patent protection.</LD>

<HD>Genuity Says It May Seek Bankruptcy Protection</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genuity Inc., a seller of high-speed Internet access, has
"substantial doubt" about whether it can keep operating and may seek
bankruptcy protection, it said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission filing.</LD>
<LD>   Genuity, which last month defaulted on $3 billion in loans, cited
the default in the SEC document as a possible reason it may seek
bankruptcy protection. It also has incurred "significant losses and
negative cash flow from operations," which it expects to continue.</LD>
<LD>   The Woburn, Mass.-based company defaulted on the loans after
Verizon Communications Inc. decided not to buy back a controlling
stake in the money-losing data-network operator. Genuity was spun off
from GTE Corp. in 2000 to win regulatory approval of Bell Atlantic
Corp.'s merger with GTE. Verizon was the product of the combination
and had the option to reacquire Genuity by June 2005.</LD>

<HD>Qwest to Pay Higher Interest Rate on Loan</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc., seeking a $500-million loan
to stave off a cash crunch, was forced by banks to accept an interest
rate higher than that paid by some bankrupt companies.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest local-telephone company in 14 Western U.S. states said
it would pay 8.75 percentage points more than the prime lending rate,
or 13.5%, on the loan. Bankrupt companies typically pay no more than
5 percentage points above benchmark rates for loans.</LD>
<LD>   The high rate shows how desperate Qwest is for cash as it
struggles to service $26.3 billion in debt after nine consecutive
quarters of losses. Qwest, waiting for proceeds from the planned sale
of its phone-book unit, is asking lenders to relax terms and give it
more time to repay $3.39 billion in loans.</LD>
<TE>   The Denver-based company wants its lenders to extend the maturity
on loans and relax a covenant that requires the company's debt to be
less than 4.25 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization.</TE>
<TE>   Shares rose 3 cents to $1.53 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>Palm Inc., the biggest maker of hand-held computers, said a federal
judge ruled that its Palm Pilot didn't infringe a patent owned by
E-Pass Technologies Inc.</LD>
<LD>   E-Pass sued in February 2000, claiming Palm used information
outlined in a 1994 patent for a credit card-sized computer to develop
and market the Palm Pilot.</LD>
<LD>   Palm has survived other allegations that its best-selling product
infringes other companies' patents. Last month, a federal judge in
Delaware also ruled that Palm didn't infringe two of NCR Corp.'s
patents for a hand-held computer system. E-Pass makes smart cards,
which are plastic cards with an embedded computer chip that stores
personal data.</LD>

<HD>US Airways Seeks to Cut Mechanics' Wages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc. has asked its mechanics to absorb an initial
wage cut and other concessions to speed its bankruptcy restructuring
and boost its chances of getting government-backed loans, the
mechanics' union said.</LD>
<LD>   Mechanics and others who earn more than $14.42 an hour would take
a 6.8% wage cut upfront, according to a US Airways proposal revealed
by the International Assn. of Machinists.</LD>
<LD>   Workers at the airline who are paid less--mostly newer utility
staffers and stock clerks--would have their wages temporarily frozen.
The proposal also would cut vacations, holidays and sick days and
eliminate the company's matching contributions to 401(k) retirement
plans.</LD>
<TE>   If the machinists ratify the proposal, the union gets one seat on
the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   The machinists union will bring the proposal to its members for a
vote Aug. 28, union spokesman Joseph Tiberi said.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways is seeking approval for $900 million in federal backing
on a $1-billion loan.</TE>
<TE>   The government's Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was
set up after the Sept. 11 attacks to assist faltering airlines, last
month gave US Airways conditional approval for the loan guarantee,
but said it needed more sacrifices from workers.</TE>
<TE>   David Castelveter, a spokesman for Arlington, Va.-based US
Airways, emphasized the need to quickly seal deals with unions. He
said the airline will ask a Bankruptcy Court judge Friday to set an
Aug. 30 deadline for ratifying contract changes.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways already has won about $550 million in annual cost
reductions through deals with its pilots and flight attendants.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways shares rose 7 cents to 47 cents on the so-called pink
sheets market.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Shares Take Another Beating</HD>
<DH>Media: The stock falls 7%. Analysts expect creditors to
help the firm because of executives' ties to banks, government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal's stock took another drubbing Thursday as investors
responded to credit downgrades and fears that the French media
conglomerate is running out of cash.</LD>
<LD>   After losing a quarter of its value Wednesday, Vivendi's stock
tumbled 7% to $10.80 a share, down 86 cents, on the New York Stock
Exchange. Vivendi's shares have fallen 80% this year.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the Paris-based entertainment giant reported a
$12-billion loss for the first half of the year, and credit agencies
warned the company could face a severe cash crunch.</LD>
<TE>   The financial crisis has placed Vivendi's fate more than ever in
the hands of its French and European creditors--the same banks that
played a key role in the dramatic ouster last month of Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier, whose two-year buying spree of media
properties, including Universal Studios, left the company with $34
billion in debt.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that Vivendi's creditors are in the driver's
seat right now," said Michael Harrington, an analyst with J.P. Morgan
in London.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's new CEO, Jean-Rene Fourtou, said Wednesday that he
expected to obtain a $2.9-billion loan from a consortium of French
and European banks by month's end to meet its cash needs this year.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts believe Vivendi is likely to get the financing
because of the new management team's close ties to the French banking
industry and the government. The French government, for example,
could provide guarantees to the banks to help Vivendi secure the
loans.</TE>
<TE>   "Vivendi is probably the most visible global French stock in the
world," Harrington said. "They are not going to let it go under."</TE>
<TE>   New Vivendi board member Claude Bebear, who played a pivotal role
in Messier's ouster, is well-respected in the French financial
community for his years of building Axa, one of the world's largest
insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear also is a director of Banque National de Paris, one of
Vivendi's top lenders.</TE>
<TE>   The consortium of banks, which includes BNP Paribas, Societe
Generale, Deutsche Bank and Credit Lyonnais, lent billions to fund
Vivendi's transformation from a water and sewage utility into the
world's second-largest media company.</TE>
<TE>   Bebear, Fourtou and fellow board member Henri Lachmann also are
close to French President Jacques Chirac, who has declared his
support for the new Vivendi management team.</TE>
<TE>   A defiant Fourtou told analysts Wednesday: "I don't think S&amp;P's
concerns about our liquidity are founded....The problems that we have
will be solved."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi desperately needs the $2.9-billion loan because it faces a
funding shortfall of about $1.4 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   The new funding essentially would cover Vivendi's cash needs
through early next year.</TE>
<TE>   But the real crunch will come next year, when Vivendi faces $5
billion in bond payments and other obligations, putting pressure on
management to raise cash now by selling assets.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Fourtou vowed Wednesday to raise $9.8 billion in
asset sales over the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   Those sales will include Houghton Mifflin, the Boston-based
textbook publisher Vivendi acquired last year, and the non-French
assets of pay-TV company Canal Plus.</TE>
<TE>   Fourtou also said Vivendi could unload its 10% stake in American
satellite TV company EchoStar Communications Corp., which Vivendi
paid $1.5 billion for in December. But the shares can't be sold until
the proposed merger between EchoStar and Hughes Electronics Corp. is
resolved. EchoStar's shares have fallen 38% this year.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fourtou also said Vivendi would revert to French
accounting standards, which are considered less rigorous than the
U.S.'</TE>
<TE>   This year, Messier began converting Vivendi's reporting to U.S.
accounting standards to attract American investors.</TE>

<HD>Bill on Free Agency for Artists Dies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill designed to open the door on free agency for recording artists
died Thursday in the California Senate.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City) announced that, "at the request
of artist representatives," he had decided not to move forward this
legislative session with Senate Bill 1246.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Murray did not have the votes to pass the bill, which
would have repealed a music-industry-supported amendment to the
California Labor Code that binds recording artists to contracts
longer than other workers.</LD>
<TE>   After listening to artists testify at hearings last year,
lawmakers told their representatives to work out a compromise on the
bill with the major record labels. The two sides have been struggling
for months to negotiate a deal but failed to come to terms on several
key points.</TE>
<TE>   Murray said he plans to introduce a comprehensive package next
year that would deal with recording artists' rights, the length of
recording contracts, music accounting practices and health-care and
pension benefits.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Lands $9.7-Billion C-17 Contract</HD>
<DH>Aerospace: The Pentagon order will help keep the Long Beach
production line open until 2008 and keep 7,000 workers employed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. on Thursday was awarded a much-anticipated order to build
60 additional C-17 transports under a $9.7-billion Pentagon contract
that will extend the life of California's last remaining military
aircraft manufacturing facility.</LD>
<LD>   In what analysts called a shot in the arm for Southern
California's aerospace industry, Boeing executives said the
contract--considered one of the largest in recent years--would help
it continue operating the C-17 production line in Long Beach until
2008 and keep 7,000 workers employed.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing has built 89 of the 120 aircraft ordered under the original
contract. It was facing the prospect in two years of having to
shutter its Long Beach Airport plant.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great day," Howard E. Chambers, general manager for
Boeing's airlift and tanker programs, said as he announced the
contract to about 1,000 employees who gathered in a massive hanger
where several C-17s were being assembled. "This is going to keep you
employed through 2008, so rest tonight and start on 60 more
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   The new C-17 contract is the latest chapter in the history of the
sprawling Long Beach aerospace complex that at one point employed
more than 40,000 workers in the 1980s. The former Douglas Aircraft
facility produced several types of commercial jets, including the
DC-10, MD-80 and MD-90. Now the only remaining commercial airliner
produced there is the 717, a program employing more than 3,000
workers.</TE>
<TE>   The contract was welcome news for what has otherwise been a dismal
year for Chicago-based Boeing, whose commercial aircraft making
business has been hammered by the slump in air travel after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company has been diversifying and pushing more
military work, Boeing still derives about 60% of its revenue from its
core commercial jet making business, which is expected to see jet
deliveries drop by nearly half.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing shares rose Thursday after getting pummeled all week amid
dire reports of growing airline woes and prospects for lower jet
orders. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares
climbed $1.14 to $37.49.</TE>
<TE>   The contract also represented a welcome relief for Long Beach
officials, who have seen the local aerospace industry virtually
collapse in the last decade and were facing the possibility of losing
the city's largest employer. Much of aerospace manufacturing has left
the state, leaving the C-17 as the last military aircraft
manufactured in California.</TE>
<TE>   "We've come a long way since its struggles and when its future was
uncertain," Long Beach Mayor Beverly O'Neill said. "We've been
waiting a long time for this."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force first proposed acquiring the additional aircraft
last fall as military operations in Afghanistan showcased the C-17's
capabilities, including dropping humanitarian supplies and
transporting U.S. troops and equipment to the front lines.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force officials have lauded the aircraft's ability to land on
short, unimproved runways while having the capacity to transport some
of the heaviest equipment in the U.S. arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Pentagon planners raised concerns that the U.S. was
running short of transport planes and proposed the additional
purchases in the latest defense budget. Congress recently approved
the budget, which included the funding for the C-17 purchases,
freeing Pentagon officials to strike a deal after Boeing offered to
slash the price of the aircraft by 25% to about $160 million each.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing said that during the last year it has been reducing costs
and has asked its subcontractors to do the same in hopes of securing
new orders. More than 700 major subcontractors, employing 30,000
workers, supply parts for the C-17. Boeing also has about 3,000
employees in St. Louis; Macon, Ga.; and Mesa, Ariz., working on the
C-17 program.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to sustain operations even longer, perhaps into the next
decade, Boeing executives said they have proposed building 42 more
C-17s for the Air Force, bringing the total to 222, or about what the
Pentagon had originally planned to acquire when it began the program
a decade ago. The Air Force plans to submit that request in its 2004
budget.</TE>

<HD>Will 'Blue Crush' Miss the Box-Office Wave?</HD>
<DH>Cinema: The balancing act between Universal and producer
Brian Grazer illustrates how high the stakes when studios pick
release dates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Blue Crush" was an under-$30-million labor of love for producer
Brian Grazer, an avid surfer who oversaw its filming on the big waves
of Oahu's North Shore. So why is he totally bummed that his movie is
opening today?</LD>
<LD>   After much lobbying by Universal Pictures, Grazer reluctantly
agreed to move his film's release from July 12 to today. But he's
still fuming over what he views as a missed opportunity to launch his
lighthearted girl-empowerment movie during the beach-party mood of
midsummer rather than when back-to-school blahs are setting in.</LD>
<LD>   "I always preferred that the movie opened in July," said Grazer,
for whom the movie was a departure from the expensive star-driven
hits such as "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and "A Beautiful Mind"
that have made him one of Hollywood's hottest producers.</LD>
<TE>   Universal Pictures Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger said he too would
have liked the film to open in July, which is historically a much
more lucrative moviegoing month than August. But he decided the movie
would face too much competition on the July 12 weekend and felt that
the studio needed more time to launch a grass-roots marketing blitz
and convince a critical demographic--the under-21 crowd--that the
film was "cool."</TE>
<TE>   "This movie was not on the radar," Shmuger said. "We had to make
it relevant to the pop culture."</TE>
<TE>   Though disputes between filmmakers and studios are commonplace in
Hollywood, the "Blue Crush" ordeal illustrates how high the stakes
are in the chess game that studios play when picking release dates.</TE>
<TE>   Because quality alone is not enough to make a hit these days,
studios pour tens of millions into marketing campaigns and stake out
key weekends to open their biggest films, sometimes two years in
advance. Sony Pictures Entertainment already has claimed the May 7
weekend in 2004 for its sequel to "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   The competition is particularly fierce during the highest-grossing
seasons of the year--the summer and winter holidays--when studios
regularly engage in last-minute jockeying of releases to stay out of
one another's way.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures   and Revolution Studios, for example, moved the
high-octane spy-action thriller "XXX" from its planned Aug. 2 release
date to Aug. 9 to avoid banging up against Walt Disney Co.'s
supernatural thriller "Signs," starring Mel Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   "The release date is certainly one of the most important
factors in opening a movie," Warner Bros. distribution chief Dan Fellman
said. "We're in a very risky business, and you want to open a film in
a time frame when you can reach the widest possible audience with the
least amount of competition."</TE>
<TE>   Something certainly not lost on Grazer is that 25% of the nation's
youngsters already are back in school, and by next weekend 40% will
be. By Labor Day weekend, it's 60%. And, according to Paul
Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracking firm Exhibitor
Relations Co., business has been down for the last four weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Shmuger insists there's still plenty of audience out there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's less perfect to push it back to August, but it's still
within summer playtime," Shmuger said. "We have to choose among
imperfect possibilities all the time. You try to make the best choice
possible."</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Blue Crush," the discussions about a release date
were the subject of a series of meetings earlier this year and
reflected in a two-page memo to Grazer in which Shmuger handicapped
the competition.</TE>
<TE>   Shmuger feared that a small, unknown film without stars,
extraordinary visual effects or a slam-dunk high concept risked
getting wiped out by a wave of high-profile movies such as "Men in
Black II" and "Road to Perdition," which came into the market with
ready-made audience awareness.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Susan Orlean's Outside magazine article "Surf Girls of
Maui" and directed and co-written by John Stockwell, the film
features an ensemble cast of relative newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Bosworth, Michele Rodriguez and Hawaii native Sanoe Lake
portray surfer roommates trying to make it in the adrenaline-charged,
male-dominated and dangerous sport of competitive surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Universal executives hope that "Blue Crush" will become a sleeper
hit much like "Bring It On," the studio's low-cost cheerleader film
that debuted in late August 2000 to a strong reception, and last
summer's car-racing movie "The Fast and the Furious."</TE>
<TE>   The studio launched an aggressive promotional campaign to raise
awareness among young moviegoers, deploying local "street teams"
across the country to hand out "Blue Crush" beach towels, beach bags,
posters and other movie paraphernalia at more than 1,000 different
events--from a Britney Spears concert in Detroit to a teen fashion
show at Minneapolis' Mall of America.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the latest tracking study, out Thursday, indicated tepid
interest among moviegoers outside the film's core audience of
12-to-21-year-old females. Though Grazer has praised Universal's
marketing efforts, the film's sluggish tracking two weeks ago had him
so concerned that he insisted Universal set aside an additional $1
million for advertising.</TE>
<TE>   The supplementary ad spend was triggered this week with new
amped-up TV spots running on popular shows such as "Fear Factor."</TE>
<TE>   The aim, Shmuger said, is to convey a "more energetic, sexier
message to all audiences--not just girls--that this is the last great
date movie of the summer."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over the "Blue Crush" release date pits the studio
against its biggest and most powerful producer. Universal and Imagine
Films Entertainment Inc., the independent production outfit that
Grazer co-founded with director Ron Howard, have a long history of
success together with such hits as"Liar Liar," "Apollo 13" and the
"Nutty Professor" comedies.</TE>
<TE>   Shmuger downplayed the brouhaha, insisting that the studio's
relationship with Grazer was as strong as ever. "This was a consensus
decision," Shmuger said. "In the end, both Imagine and Universal
signed off on this date."</TE>
<TE>   But sources recall the difficulties getting there.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite a negotiation to get Brian to say yes," noted one.</TE>
<TE>   After endless discussions about switching release dates, Shmuger
sized up the competition weekend by weekend in July and August and
laid out the options with various pros and cons to Grazer in an April
25 memo.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that July 12 is "historically a great summer
weekend," Shmuger feared that competition from the holdover hit "Men
in Black II" and newcomers "Road to Perdition," "Reign of Fire" and
"Crocodile Hunter" (the latter two wound up tanking), could easily
squeeze out "Blue Crush."</TE>
<TE>   Shmuger suggested that its best shot would be Aug. 16, when the
only other new release was Warner Bros.' long-delayed Eddie Murphy
comedy "The Adventures of Pluto Nash," while admitting the weekend
was "not as consistently strong as the [other] choices."</TE>
<TE>   He also acknowledged that "we are beginning to get late in summer
for a fun-in-the-sun surf movie," but determined that "we have a
strong shot at opening number one--which may make it worth it."</TE>
<TE>   That's the kind of guarantee any producer would want. But then
there are no such guarantees in the movie business. Studios don't
decide the box office; paying customers do. Although industry sources
estimate "Blue Crush" will debut with $15 million to $18 million this
weekend, the film faces tough competition from "XXX" and "Signs."</TE>
<TE>   In the last line of his memo to Grazer, Shmuger concedes: "As you
know, it's hard to ever guess this stuff right."</TE>

<TE>   Late Takeoff</TE>
<TE>   Producer Brian Grazer was hoping his surf movie, `Blue Crush,'
would open at the height of the summer season on July 12, but
distributor Universal Pictures moved the release date to today
because the competitive waters looked too treacherous for a small
film at the earlier date.</TE>
<TE>   Wide-release films `Blue Crush' would have faced July 12 and their
opening weekend box-office receipts, in millions:</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks/Fox's `Road to Perdition' -- $22.0</TE>
<TE>   Disney/SpyGlass' `Reign of Fire' -- 15.6</TE>
<TE>   Dimension Films' `Halloween: Resurrection' -- 12.3</TE>
<TE>   MGM's `The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course' -- 9.5</TE>
<TE>   What's also opening this weekend:</TE>
<TE>   `The Adventures of Pluto Nash,' a Warner Bros. space comedy with
Eddie Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   But `Blue Crush' faces tough competition from a couple of holdover
hits:</TE>
<TE>   Sony Pictures/Revolution Studios' `XXX,' which debuted last
weekend at $44.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's `Signs,' which last weekend took in $29.5 million after
two weeks in release.</TE>

<HD>Dell to Add Hand-Helds, Printers to Its Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dell Computer Corp. Chief Executive Michael Dell on Thursday
confirmed plans to enter the printer and hand-held computer
businesses, ending months of hinting by company executives and
investor speculation that the computer giant would take
Hewlett-Packard Co. head-on in those markets.</LD>
<LD>   "Printers are a large and attractive market," said Dell, who made
his comments during a conference call to announce the Austin,
Texas-based company's second-quarter earnings. "We're looking at both
inkjets and laser products."</LD>
<LD>   Dell also said the hand-held market was attractive because the
technology for personal digital assistants, or PDAs, was standard,
requiring low investments to enter.</LD>
<TE>   "I think you'll be hearing from us later," said Dell, who declined
to offer a timeline or product details.</TE>
<TE>   The comments came after HP last month stopped selling its printers
to Dell, citing competitive reasons. HP captured Dell's No. 1
position in personal computer sales after it merged with Compaq
Computer Corp. this year. But HP's lead is slim, and Dell continues
to gain market share.</TE>
<TE>   As for Dell's second-quarter results, revenue was $8.5 billion, up
11% from the same quarter last year, while sales for the rest of the
computer industry were down 10%. The company had earlier
predicted--and analysts had expected--sales to be $8.3 billion. Net
income of $501 million, or 19 cents a share, was up 16% from last
year, in line with estimates. Dell also forecast $8.9 billion in
sales for the third quarter ending October, with earnings between 20
cents and 21 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Dell rose to $27.32 in after-hours trading after falling 1 cent to
$27.14 in regular Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   "Their market share is pretty hard to argue with," said Mark
Specker, analyst with SoundView Technologies Group in San Francisco.
"They are essentially the only part of the PC business that's
growing, and they're doing it by taking a lot of market share."</TE>
<TE>   Still, HP spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy said: "Dell's business model
is not a template for success in the businesses they're toying with,
such as printing."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts agreed Dell will face a tough fight against HP and Palm
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be easy for Dell to enter these markets, but it doesn't
mean it will be easy for them to succeed," said Jennifer Thorwart,
research analyst with IDC.</TE>
<TE>   In printers, HP is the market leader, with a 37% worldwide market
share of inkjet printers in 2001 and a 51% share of laser printers,
according to IDC. In PDAs, Palm dominates with a 55% share, while
Sony Corp. has about 25% and Handspring Inc. has 10%, according to
NPD Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   With printers, the bulk of the profits lies in selling replacement
ink cartridges, which are generally purchased in retail stores.</TE>
<TE>   "If you run out of ink in the middle of the night, you go to the
store and you get a cartridge," Specker said. Dell, however, sells
its products online and has little or no relationship with retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Though Dell continues to sell HP printers, it obtains them from
distributors instead of from HP. Dell sold 2 million printers last
year, including about $300 million in HP printers. Dell accounts for
8% of HP's inkjet sales, according to a Lehman Bros. report.</TE>
<TE>   With PDAs, analysts say Dell is betting that the devices will
eventually double as cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   "The profit pool in PDAs is pathetic," Specker said. "But the
profit pool in cell phones is pretty darn interesting. That's the way
Dell is looking at it over the next two to three years."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike HP, Palm does not feel threatened by Dell's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been assured by Dell executives in the last couple of
weeks that they will continue to sell Palm-branded hand-helds,"
Marlene Somsak, spokeswoman for Milpitas, Calif.-based Palm. "They've
acknowledged that Palm-branded hand-helds are their best-sellers.
We've got a very good relationship with Dell and we expect it to
continue."</TE>

<HD>EchoStar Facing Probes in 10 States</HD>
<DH>Television: Allegations of consumer law violations are at
the center of the inquiries. The satellite TV company posts a profit
of $37 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. is the subject of civil investigations
by attorneys general in 10 states for allegedly violating consumer
protection laws in its satellite TV business, according to a
regulatory filing.</LD>
<LD>   Two states initiated civil probes of the Littleton, Colo.-based
satellite TV company in April, and eight others followed suit during
the last three months. According to Echo- Star's filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the states are accusing the firm
of violations based on its call response times, advertising and
customer agreement disclosures, its policies for handling consumer
complaints, issuing rebates and refunds and charging cancellation
fees to consumers.</LD>
<LD>   EchoStar said that it has cooperated in the probes, but that "it
is too early to make an assessment of the probable outcome, or to
determine the extent of any damages or injunctive relief which could
result."</LD>
<TE>   The state investigations come as EchoStar is fending off
accusations that retailers of its Dish Network satellite TV service
may have made false statements in telemarketing campaigns aimed at
luring away current Los Angeles customers of troubled cable TV
operator Adelphia Communications Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said fallout from the state probes also could undermine
EchoStar's ability to push through its proposed satellite TV merger
with DirecTV's parent, Hughes Electronics Corp. But EchoStar
executives said they remain optimistic about closing the transaction
before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Regulatory analysts, however, say that even before word of the
state probes, prospects for approval of the deal appeared dim. The
merger would combine the No. 1 and No. 2 satellite providers and
provide the new company with 90% of the national satellite TV market,
including a monopoly in many rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   The civil probe is another drawback to the EchoStar-DirecTV deal,
said Andrew Jay Schwartzmann, president of the Washington-based Media
Access Project. "This kind of stuff has a cumulative effect. The
conventional wisdom in Washington is that this deal is in deep
trouble. The likelihood of this thing making it all the way through
is under 50%."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, one of the dangers of an unregulated monopoly is that
consumers are going to have less choice when things go wrong," said
Scott Holste, a spokesman for Missouri Atty. Gen. Jay Nixon, one of
several state officials reviewing the merger. "Responsiveness to
consumers, that would be a concern."</TE>
<TE>   Holste declined to say if Nixon's office initiated one of the
consumer probes. Florida and Connecticut reportedly are among the
states examining EchoStar. A spokeswoman for California Atty. Gen.
Bill Lockyer said he was not involved in the probe.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call Thursday, EchoStar Chief Executive Charles
Ergen surprised some analysts by striking a conciliatory tone in
discussing the investigations, rather than denying any improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not perfect, and we're still learning," Ergen said. "We can
certainly do a better job, and there's certainly some helpful
suggestions in our discussions with state attorneys general."</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar also released its quarterly results Thursday, posting a
profit of $37 million, or 8 cents a share, contrasted with a loss of
$6 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier. Revenue in the latest quarter
rose 21% to $1.17 billion, compared with $966 million a year
earelier.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, EchoStar's shares rose $1.64 to $17 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Eisner Buys $10 Million Worth of Disney Stock</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Eisner is putting his money where his mouse is.</LD>
<LD>   The Walt Disney Co. chief executive, under fire for Disney's
lagging stock price, said Thursday that he bought $10 million in
company stock this week on the open market as a show of support for
Disney's prospects.</LD>
<LD>   Disney said the 725,700 shares were bought for $13.55 to $14.49 a
share.</LD>
<TE>   A Disney spokesman said Eisner did not want to comment on the
purchase. But in a statement, Disney said Eisner's investment
"demonstrates his personal confidence in the company's direction and
prospects for growth over the long term."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner has been under growing heat with Disney's stock hitting an
eight-year low last week, theme park attendance lagging and, in
particular, poor ratings continuing at the ABC TV network. Within the
last two weeks, tensions have built between the CEO and Disney's
board of directors, especially Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney and his
lieutenant, Stanley P. Gold.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Roy Disney and Gold declined to comment on the
purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Executive pay expert Graef Crystal, a former consultant to Disney
on Eisner's pay package, said Eisner's move appears aimed at defusing
the tensions by sending a message to board members and institutional
investors that he believes the company will rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "He's saying, 'I know that the company's in trouble, but I have
confidence in my management and I wouldn't put my money in it if I
didn't think I'd get a good return,' " Crystal said.</TE>

<HD>Southland Home Prices Rise Again</HD>
<DH>Real estate: An unsteady stock market helps continue the
trend as L.A. County sees the median cost grow by 15% in July. O.C.
has a 19% increase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices jumped from year-ago levels across much of the Southland
again in July as low interest rates and a wobbly stock market helped
sustain an upward trend that began early this year.</LD>
<LD>   The median home price, the point at which half the homes sell for
more and half for less, rose nearly 19% in Orange County to $360,000,
according to a report released Thursday by DataQuick Information
Systems Inc. Prices set a record there for the fourth month in a row.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles County, the nation's largest for-sale housing
market, a typical home rose to a near-record $266,000, or 15% more
from a year earlier, the La Jolla-based firm said.</LD>
<TE>   The July market was driven by an imbalance between supply and
demand, lower mortgage rates and investors fleeing the stock market
for the perceived stability of real estate.</TE>
<TE>   Prices rose on just about everything, from starter condos to
million-dollar homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is floating on the same rising tide," said John
Karevoll, the analyst who prepared the report.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everyone, that is. Real estate brokers said multiple offers
are still common on homes priced under $1 million, but falling stock
prices have slowed sales of homes offered for $2 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "The buyer at that level is taking a wait-and-see attitude," said
John Aaroe, a partner at Prudential California Realty in Los Angeles.
He estimated that sales in that price range have slowed by 20% from a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You are finding people with an ability to buy, but are saying, 'I
won't trade up until I'm sure I won't be affected by Wall Street,' "
he said.</TE>
<TE>   As prices continue to rise for most homes in Los Angeles and
Orange counties, many consumers are concerned that the market may be
growing overvalued. But Karevoll said monthly costs remain well below
their peak of a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Take Los Angeles County, where mortgage payments rose to their
highest level in 1989. Then, a typical home cost $2,378 a month in
today's dollars--65% more than the current median of $1,441 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has experienced a similar effect. Mortgages in
Orange County peaked at $2,725 in 1989 when adjusted for inflation,
but now run 28% less, or $1,950 a month.</TE>
<TE>   That analysis suggests prices can rise as much as 30% to 40%,
under current mortgage rates, before consumers would be driven off by
rising costs. "We're nowhere near that point right now in Southern
California," Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts, though agreeing in principle, said there is less
room for price increases than Karevoll believes. Real estate
economist Michael Sklarz of Fidelity National Information Solutions
said homes in Los Angeles County were 19% overvalued in 1992 compared
with 11% now, using a ratio of employment and incomes.</TE>
<TE>   He predicts that home prices would not crash as they did when the
market softened a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Conditions today are different, Sklarz said. There is no glut of
new housing that could cause builders to sharply lower prices,
undercutting owners of existing homes who are trying to unload their
properties.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he expects the job market to grow steadily and not
contract as it did in the 1990s. And mortgage rates are much lower
than they were back then.</TE>
<TE>   Those factors will prevent a decline in values, Sklarz said. But
as fewer people can afford to make purchases, he said, "we should
expect a flattening in prices."</TE>
<TE>   Falling mortgage rates will keep the market robust in the months
ahead, some analysts predict. Secondary mortgage investor Freddie Mac
said long-term rates slid Thursday to 6.22%, the lowest point since
the weekly survey of lenders began in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Triggered by declines in mortgage rates this year, banks and other
mortgage providers in Southern California have been besieged by
consumers who want to redo their home loans at lower rates.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect a record amount of refinancing in Southern
California this year, which would prop up the economy by freeing
income that could be spent on other goods.</TE>
<TE>   Sales have been boosted by low mortgage rates.</TE>
<TE>   A buyer with an income of $80,000 can qualify for a home loan that
is $30,000 greater now than in late March, according to John Burns,
an Irvine real estate consultant.</TE>
<TE>   July sales in Orange County climbed nearly 9% from a year earlier,
DataQuick said. They were flat in Los Angeles County, but at a
historically high pace. In Los Angeles, nearly 10,900 homes changed
hands, the fourth-highest count in July since the real estate
research firm began tracking the market in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Sales could be delayed in coming months by the surge in loan
refinancing that already has begun to strain the system.</TE>

<HD>IRS Seeks More Offshore Records</HD>
<DH>Probe: In a widening investigation, the agency asks a court
for access to MasterCard transactions to help it find Americans who
evade taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government Thursday widened its probe into offshore tax
cheating, asking a federal court in Miami to grant it access to
MasterCard International Inc. records on credit cards issued by banks
in 30 countries used as tax havens by Americans.</LD>
<LD>   A similar probe earlier this year identified hundreds of thousands
of Americans who were holding assets in previously undisclosed
offshore accounts.</LD>
<LD>   If the latest summons is granted, as some accountants believe it
will be, it will force MasterCard to turn over 1999, 2000 and 2001
records for U.S. clients that have credit cards issued by banks in
countries the Internal Revenue Service identifies as tax havens,
including the Bahamas, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Switzerland,
Liechtenstein, Latvia, Luxembourg, Panama, Singapore and Hong Kong.</LD>
<TE>   Tax experts say this latest request--a precursor to greater
efforts by the government to crack down on tax evasion--will result
in thousands of civil and criminal prosecutions over the coming
years.</TE>
<TE>   "Criminal prosecutions are going to skyrocket," said Ian Comisky,
partner in the Philadelphia law firm of Blank, Rome, Comisky &amp;
McCauley and coauthor of the book "Tax Fraud and Evasion."</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers are so massive that the question is going to be
whether they'll have sufficient resources to handle all the
prosecutions," Comisky said.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1 million and 2 million Americans have offshore bank
accounts, but less than 10% of them filed the required reports
disclosing the accounts in the 2000 tax year, the IRS said.</TE>
<TE>   The offshore accounts cost the government between $20 billion and
$40 billion a year in lost tax revenue, according to General
Accounting Office estimates.</TE>
<TE>   Offshore banks, shielded by their nation's privacy laws, rarely
agree to release customer information to U.S. tax authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Until last year, that left the IRS without the detailed
information it needed to find and prosecute tax cheats who use these
offshore havens.</TE>
<TE>   However, the agency realized that many American citizens were
using Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards to access their
offshore cash, and launched a legal effort to get information on
those credit card transactions.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000 and early 2001, courts in Miami and San Francisco
granted the agency access to 1998 and 1999 credit card records held
by Visa, MasterCard and American Express about accounts with banks in
Antigua, Barbuda, Bahamas and Cayman Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Those records have allowed the IRS to identify hundreds of
thousands of individuals, trusts and U.S. corporations that are
believed to be using offshore accounts to illegally evade taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS has developed hundreds of cases that have led to tax
audits or criminal investigations based on this data, the agency said
Thursday. Many more are expected.</TE>
<TE>   "Offshore accounts have enabled people to evade billions of
dollars of income taxes each year in the United States," said Eileen
J. O'Connor, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's
tax division in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "The information obtained with the summons will help the IRS
identify more tax evaders," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the IRS' previous success in obtaining court orders to
get records for offshore credit card accounts, Comisky said the
courts are likely to grant the agency's latest request.</TE>

<HD>Amtrak Halts Express Trains Again as More Cracks Are Found</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Amtrak's optimistic timetable for restoring Acela Express service
broke down Thursday when additional cracks were found on the
undersides of locomotives that power the high-speed trains.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time this week, Amtrak canceled all Acela Express
runs and tried to plug the scheduling gaps by putting more
conventional trains into service.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to Amtrak's struggles, inspectors for the first time found
cracks in shock-absorbing assemblies underneath a locomotive other
than the ones that pull Acela Express trains, which operate only
between Washington, New York and Boston.</LD>
<TE>   That locomotive and 14 others like it were built under the same
contract, and by the same manufacturers, as the 18 Acela Express
trains; they also serve the Northeastern corridor. Amtrak quickly
pulled the conventional locomotives from service, exacerbating its
equipment squeeze.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak scrambled to find replacement gear and even leased some
locomotives and coach cars from commuter agencies in Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Maryland. It planned to offer 115 departures in the
Northeast today, compared with the typical 140.</TE>
<TE>   Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said the conventional locomotives
have shock-absorbing "yaw damper" assemblies that are virtually
identical to those underneath Acela Express locomotives.</TE>
<TE>   All the cracks and breaks have involved brackets that connect the
yaw dampers to the train. A yaw damper assembly that fell off a
moving train could damage its underside or possibly derail it or
another train.</TE>
<TE>   Bombardier of North America, which built the trains along with
France's Alstom Ltd., sent Amtrak 40 replacement brackets that are
slightly thicker than the ones initially installed on the trains.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Sharpe, a spokeswoman for Bombardier, said the company
proposed a temporary fix under which the new brackets will be applied
to two of the Acela Express trains while repairs are made to existing
brackets on the others.</TE>
<TE>   Stan Bagley, Amtrak's chief operating officer, said that some
Acela Express service could return next week, with full service
resuming the following week, but only if the temporary fix proceeds
as hoped. "My customers and my employees are being inconvenienced by
this, so naturally I want to see everything back as quickly as we
can," he said. "At the same time, I want [workers] not to rush, and I
want them to use good judgment."</TE>
<TE>   The Acela Express service, a pricey but popular alternative for
business and leisure travelers in the Northeast, was suspended
Tuesday after inspectors first discovered cracks and breaks in the
yaw damper assemblies that keep locomotives from swaying at high
speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Two trains that passed inspection returned to service Wednesday,
and Amtrak hoped to add three more on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But a more rigorous inspection of one of those three trains early
Thursday prompted Amtrak officials to suspend all service once again.
Inspectors "found cracks that had not been previously detected,"
Amtrak spokesman Bill Schulz said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares in Alstom took a pounding Thursday on the Paris stock
exchange amid the mounting concerns about the trains the company has
supplied to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet-nosed trains can travel at speeds up to 150 mph. Until
this week, Amtrak typically sent 15 of the trains into duty each day.</TE>
<TE>   About 10,000 people ride Acela Express trains on a typical
weekday.</TE>
<TE>   The high-speed trains entered service in November 2000, after more
than a year of delays. Cracks first appeared near the yaw-dampening
assemblies during testing of the trains, said Rob Gould, a spokesman
for the Federal Railroad Administration, but those were attributed to
bolts that were too tight.</TE>
<TE>   Gould said the railway agency determined that the issue was not a
significant safety risk but required Amtrak to perform rigorous
inspections of the trains once they entered service.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in constant contact with Amtrak" this week, Gould
said. "Our end game is to make sure whatever fix they come up with is
safe."</TE>

<HD>Arctic Rose Kin Get $9 Million</HD>
<DH>Shipwreck: The April 2, 2001, sinking of the 92-foot vessel
killed all 15 fishermen on board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The families of the 15 men who died when the fishing vessel Arctic
Rose sank in the Bering Sea will divide insurance money estimated at
less than $9 million, lawyers said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 92-foot Seattle-based vessel sank April 2, 2001, killing all
aboard. It was the region's worst U.S. fishing vessel disaster in
decades.</LD>
<LD>   The ship had been trawling for sole after a winter season plagued
by mechanical problems, poor fishing and foul weather.</LD>
<TE>   A Coast Guard board of inquiry report on the sinking is expected
later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The settlements involved insurance companies for the boat's
owners, Arctic Sole Seafoods and President Dave Olney.</TE>
<TE>   The individual settlements are confidential, but they ranged from
roughly $200,000 to more than $1 million for at least one crew member
survived by a wife and dependent children, according to lawyers
involved in the case.</TE>
<TE>   David Bratz, a maritime lawyer representing the owner and
insurers, said he was pleased that the settlements could be reached
without extended trials.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Beard, a lawyer representing six Arctic Rose families, said
most of the settlements were substantially greater than had been
historically paid out for fishermen's deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The typical figure for crewmen without dependents was about
$250,000, according to Steve Fury, another maritime attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy Meincke lost her 20-year-old son, Jeff, of Lacey, whose trip
aboard the Arctic Rose was his first fishing job.</TE>
<TE>   Meincke said she had hoped for a bigger settlement that would have
produced more pressure from the insurers to improve safety in the
commercial fishing industry.</TE>
<TE>   Kari Rundall, the widow of Arctic Rose skipper Dave Rundall, said
she's pleased she now has enough money to ensure college educations
for her three sons.</TE>
<TE>   Rundall's body was the only one recovered.</TE>

<HD>At Mt. Rushmore, Bush Stands Firm on Security</HD>
<DH>Politics: In visit to monument, he decries Senate's
alterations to homeland measure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MT. RUSHMORE NATIONAL MEMORIAL, S.D. -- Using four sculpted icons of
American democracy as his silent backdrop, President Bush said
Thursday that he was steadfast in refusing to yield to Senate
Democrats' modification of the legislation creating the Department of
Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   Bush visited the monument--far from the ports and borders that
suggest vulnerability--to rally support for the measure, which Senate
Democrats say would unfairly restrict the rights of federal workers
by exposing them to arbitrary shifts in assignment.</LD>
<LD>   He also expressed sympathy for farmers and ranchers suffering from
the worst drought in South Dakota since the Dust Bowl years of the
1930s, but he offered them no new federal assistance.</LD>
<TE>   The drought and the federal response to it have become factors in
a tight Senate race between Tim Johnson, the Democratic incumbent,
and his Republican challenger, Rep. John R. Thune.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke under the unblinking gaze of four presidents carved
into the mile-high mountainside. The 60-foot busts of George
Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln
looked eastward into the sun as the 43rd president delved into the
nitty-gritty of Washington's political debate.</TE>
<TE>   The House has passed the homeland security bill that Bush
proposed, but its critics in the Senate say it would remove
protections provided by union-negotiated agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little worried about some of the noise I hear," the
president said. "I don't want our hands tied so we cannot do the No.
1 job you expect, which is to protect the homeland. I need to be able
to shift resources without a time-consuming approval process.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to have the capacity to respond to the needs of the
American people. Unfortunately, the bill in the Senate right now
won't let me do that."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed department was designed to incorporate the work of
more than 100 government agencies, scattered across multiple
departments, so that the work of protecting the United States from
terrorist attack could be coordinated by one Cabinet secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the new department would be able to move money from one
project to another--for example, to buy medicine to counter a
biological weapon. "We don't have that flexibility right now," he
said. "I'm not allowed to reorganize old agencies to meet new
threats."</TE>
<TE>   He said the Senate bill would "micromanage the capacity of the
executive branch to do the business on behalf of the American
people."</TE>
<TE>   He also complained that it would remove the authority every
president since Jimmy Carter has had to exempt agencies from
collective-bargaining requirements if he determined that national
security required such a move.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), who, along with
Johnson, was invited by the White House to the speech, said later,
"What we simply want to do is protect the rights of the workers." As
leader of the Senate Democrats, Daschle has been instrumental in
holding up the legislation, which the Senate is likely to consider
when it returns in September from its summer recess.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also dismissed Bush's words on the drought. "There was
little the president offered ... in terms of help or hope," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said that the recently approved farm bill provides $180
billion in various forms of aid for agriculture, and that if farmers
and ranchers need help, the money should be shifted from that bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what drought means to people who make a living off
the land. I know how people suffer ... when there is no rain," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, who discussed the economy with local residents earlier in
the day, said: "I talked to ranchers who have been on their family
ranch for years, wondering whether they can stay on. I talked to
community leaders who wonder whether or not there is a place for
young farmers and young ranchers in this society. You know, people
hurt here, and I know that.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help deal with this drought. As we move forward to
help our ranchers with drought relief, I expect that help to come
from the $180 billion so we don't run up additional deficits in the
federal budget."</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the crowd under a black felt cowboy hat, Joseph
Norman, whose family has ranched the land 20 miles north of Rapid
City for more than 120 years, was not satisfied.</TE>
<TE>   He said that although he supports Thune in the Senate race, "more
needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The question of federal assistance to ameliorate the hardships of
the drought has become a sensitive matter for Thune, who has argued
that as a Republican, he can deliver help for the state with a
Republican in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   South Dakota State University has estimated that the drought is
costing the state $4 million to $5 million a day, and Norman said the
cost of feed is forcing his fellow ranchers to sell herds they had
spent years breeding.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson and Daschle have pressed the administration to provide $5
billion in relief for farmers, ranchers and small businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The visit to Mt. Rushmore was the second by a President Bush. The
president's father visited on July 3, 1991, dedicating the national
memorial 50 years after the carvings, carried out under the direction
of sculptor John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum.</TE>
<TE>   That was a few months after the end of the Persian Gulf War, and
before he went hiking and fishing in the pine-covered Black Hills
here, the elder Bush celebrated under a flag so large it was lofted
by helium-filled balloons as military jets streaked across the clear
sky.</TE>
<TE>   The weather was similarly crisp on Thursday, although the
patriotic and military symbolism was on a lesser scale. And instead
of going for a hike after he spoke, the younger Bush, in a dark gray
suit, white shirt and blue tie--headed back to Air Force One for a
trip home to his ranch near Crawford, Texas, where he is spending his
August vacation.</TE>

<HD>Levy's Clothes Show No Trace of Killer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An FBI laboratory analysis of clothing found with former federal
intern Chandra Levy's remains provided no clues about her killer's
identity, law enforcement officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police hoped that Levy's T-shirt, running bra, leggings and
exercise shoes would hold microscopic traces of blood, hair, fibers
or semen that could lead them to her attacker.</LD>
<LD>   "There was nothing useful," said a police official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Sgt. Joe Gentile, a Washington police spokesman, would not comment
on the results of the lab work. "The case is still under
investigation," Gentile said.</TE>
<TE>   A man walking his dog and looking for turtles found Levy's remains
on a steep hillside in Rock Creek Park on May 22, nearly 13 months
after she disappeared. She was 24.</TE>
<TE>   Her case drew national attention because of her relationship with
Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres). Condit, 54 and married, reportedly
told police he and Levy, a constituent from Modesto, were having an
affair, but police do not consider him a suspect in her death.</TE>
<TE>   Although Levy's remains did not show conclusively how she died,
police believe she was killed where her remains lay or nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jonathan Arden, Washington's medical examiner, said he found
no sign of shooting, stabbing or beating. Strangulation remains one
theory, he has said.</TE>
<TE>   So little could be gleaned from the bones because her body lay
undetected for more than a year in a park teeming with wildlife.</TE>

<HD>Wildfire Reignites, Threatens Buildings</HD>
<DH>Evacuation: A blaze that began in July flared up again in
western Colorado.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo.</DL>
<LD>A ranch, a lodge and a campground were evacuated Thursday when a
5-week-old wildfire flared up and threatened 50 structures.</LD>
<LD>   Air tankers and a hand crew were en route to the 600-acre blaze in
the Flattops Wilderness Area, 34 miles southwest of Steamboat Springs
and 125 miles west of Denver.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was sparked by lightning July 8 but had been allowed to
burn because it was in a wilderness area.</LD>
<TE>   "Now all of a sudden it's taken off," fire information officer
Roger Condie said. "It was only at 200 acres" Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The fire crept to within half a mile of Rio Blanco Ranch, Trappers
Lake Lodge and Trappers Lake Campground Thursday night, fire
information officer Larry Helmerick said. He did not know how many
people had been evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Colorado, crews contained a 100-acre wildfire that
had prompted the evacuation of 90 homes 10 miles west of Denver a day
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe a passing train sparked a pair of wildfires
that merged and quickly spread in the foothills, threatening an
upscale neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators were still trying to determine what caused a
single-engine air tanker that had been dropping retardant on the fire
to veer off a runway at Jefferson County Airport on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pilot Steven Whary of San Angelo, Texas, walked away from the
accident, which came nearly one month after an air tanker crashed
while fighting a wildfire near Rocky Mountain National Park, killing
two.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation
Administration were investigating. The U.S. Forest Service also
planned to look into the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Near Durango, crews reinforced lines around a 1,400-acre fire on
the Southern Ute Indian Reservation. It was fully contained Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 personnel were burning some of the remaining fuels.</TE>

<HD>This Time, the IRS Is Missing Computers</HD>
<DH>Government: Private taxpayer data may be on machines, audit
shows. News follows similar reports from other U.S. agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Another big batch of government computers has gone missing, this time
at the Internal Revenue Service, and they could hold private taxpayer
data such as Social Security numbers and bank account information.</LD>
<LD>   An audit released Thursday shows that the IRS is unable to account
for an unknown number of the 6,600 laptop and desktop computers lent
to volunteers who assist low-income, disabled, non-English-speaking
and older people with their tax returns.</LD>
<LD>   The audit follows similar reports that the Customs Service had
lost track of 2,000 computers and that the Justice Department was
unable to find 400. An audit this summer of other IRS programs
indicated 2,300 computers were missing.</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, senior Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee, said in a letter to the White House that the
latest disclosure cries out for a "government-wide effort" to prevent
computers from being lost or stolen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm worried that just as dryers have a knack of making socks
disappear, the federal government has discovered a core competency of
losing computers," Grassley wrote White House budget chief Mitchell
E. Daniels Jr.</TE>
<TE>   John Dalrymple, commissioner of the IRS' wage and investment
division, said the agency's management "recognized that inadequate
internal controls and accountability over computers were areas that
needed dramatic improvement."</TE>
<TE>   The latest audit, from the Treasury Department's tax inspector
general, examined computer equipment lent by the IRS in 2001 for the
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly
program. About 1.1 million returns were prepared under the two
programs, including 700,000 that were filed electronically.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors could not account for 93% of computers when doing a
random check of a central IRS inventory database. Although that does
not automatically mean the computers were lost or stolen, there is no
way to be certain.</TE>
<TE>   Even more troubling is that missing computers could hold private
taxpayer data. "Information on tax forms is regarded as a prime
target for identity thieves," the audit says. In addition, the IRS
could not guarantee that such information had been removed from the
computer hard drives at the end of April as required.</TE>
<TE>   In response, IRS officials said that an inventory and
consolidation of the equipment should be completed by July 2003 and
that instructions have already been issued to managers to make sure
taxpayer files are deleted. The agency promised a list of other
improvements, some begun before the audit was made public.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the agency's pledge to do better, Grassley noted that the
IRS has not always taken corrective actions recommended by previous
audits. "I am concerned that words are matched by deeds," Grassley
said in separate letter to the IRS.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BASSETT, Va.</DL>
<LD>Police were searching Thursday for a 9-year-old girl after finding
her parents shot to death at their home in western Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   Henry County Sheriff's Capt. Kimmy Nester said they were searching
for the girl, Jennifer Short, on the presumption that she had been
abducted. Investigators said evidence seemed to rule out a
murder-suicide.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities issued an Amber Alert, relaying information about the
case to television and radio stations in the hope of finding a lead.
Police officers spread out and paced the rolling hills behind the
Shorts' house.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody knows where this child is. That's not normal," Nester
said. "The family is all in shock."</TE>
<TE>   He said that other family members who live in the immediate area
didn't know anything about the girl's whereabouts, and that police
have no suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of Michael Short, 50, and Mary Short, 36, were found by
a co-worker who dropped by the home 35 miles south of Roanoke, said
Franklin County Sheriff W. Quint Overton.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Short, a self-employed mobile-home mover, was found on a
couch in an enclosed carport; Mary Short was found in a bedroom. Both
had been shot once in the head.</TE>
<TE>   The family lived in a red brick home surrounded by motels and gas
stations on U.S. 220, a busy north-south highway. Traffic crept along
the road late Thursday as police set up a command center.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Short's brother-in-law, Thomas Lynch, stared in disbelief as
a hearse carried away the bodies, crossing over the yellow tape
circling the home. "They were good people," he said. "I don't know
what else to say."</TE>
<TE>   The Shorts were a tight-knit family who enjoyed spending time
together, neighbors and family members said. Jennifer helped her
parents work in the yard. On Wednesday, she told the owner of the
convenience store next door that she was excited about going back to
school.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a good kid," said Chris Young, another brother-in-law of
Mary Short's and a Franklin County sheriff's deputy. "She had a dog
and a cat and she loved them. I just wish I knew where she is."</TE>
<TE>   The nearest neighbor, Ruby Emberson, 74, said she had no idea of
anything wrong with the family.</TE>
<TE>   "They were always outdoors together in the yard mowing the grass
or whatever," she said. "They seemed as happy as could be."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Marlene Dalton said that on Aug. 5, the Shorts
had asked her to put their house up for sale. "Mr. Short said
business was just slow," she said. "He said, 'I've got a trailer of
my own and we're going to move and live in that for a while.' "</TE>

<HD>Judge Delays Her Order to Reveal Names of Detainees</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Ruling that the Justice Dept. must identify
nearly 1,200 held after Sept. 11 is put on hold pending the outcome
of appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday put on hold her ruling requiring the Justice
Department to release the names of the nearly 1,200 people detained
in the investigation into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, saying she
does not want to interfere with the government's appeal.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler issued an indefinite stay of
her Aug. 2 ruling, saying that ordering the government to release the
names now would make it impossible to keep them secret if her initial
ruling is overturned by an appellate court.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department, which has filed an appeal, praised
Kessler, saying that releasing the names of the detainees would give
an unfair advantage to terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   "In appealing this case, the Justice Department continues its
efforts to prevent terrorists from developing a road map to our
ongoing terrorism investigation, to decrease the risk of a future
attack on the American people, and to protect the privacy interests
of those who were detained and chose not to identify themselves
publicly as detainees," said Robert McCallum, assistant attorney
general for the civil division.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler, a judge for the District of Columbia, had given the
Justice Department 15 days to release the names of people arrested or
detained since the attacks, most of whom have been freed from
custody. Kessler also had ordered the release of the names of
detainees' lawyers but did not require the government to release some
other pieces of information, such as where detainees were being held
and the circumstances surrounding their arrests.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of the more than 20 civil rights, human rights and
civil liberties groups that filed the lawsuit seeking the names said
Kessler's ruling was merely procedural.</TE>
<TE>   "The ruling merely preserves the government's ability to appeal.
There is nothing about the decision that detracts from Judge
Kessler's finding that the names should be disclosed," said David
Sobel, general counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal could take months.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's initial ruling two weeks ago was a setback for the
Justice Department, which had been resisting efforts to turn over the
names. The groups, including the Center for National Security Studies
and Amnesty International, filed the legal challenge to the
government's policy of secret arrests under the Freedom of
Information Act.</TE>
<TE>   In her initial ruling, Kessler rejected the Justice Department's
contention that releasing the names of the detainees would help
terrorists, including Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network, which
remains the subject of a massive manhunt by U.S. authorities and
their allies.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's ruling Thursday did not discuss the merits of the case,
only that it is being appealed.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the fact that stays are routinely granted in FOIA cases,
[the] disclosure of the names of the detainees and their lawyers
would effectively moot any appeal," Kessler wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's ruling Thursday came a day after a group of Democratic
members of Congress urged the Justice Department to drop its appeal
and make the names public.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view continues to be that with only a few narrow exceptions,
secret arrests and detentions are inconsistent with a free,
democratic society and the rule of law," said the senators, including
Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the Judiciary Committee chairman. "By
ceasing efforts to appeal the federal court ruling and instead
releasing the information about the detainees as ordered, the Justice
Department can bring this unfortunate chapter to a close."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the FBI announced Thursday that its top
counter-terrorism official is retiring, and that a top aide of FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III is assuming a new post as the bureau's
No. 2 person.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Watson, executive assistant director, will retire from the
FBI next month to take a job as a consultant to Booz, Allen &amp;
Hamilton Inc., which is working closely with the FBI on improving
internal security measures, a federal law enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   Watson has spent 24 years with the bureau, the last 20 in
counter-terrorism and counterintelligence roles. Watson was the FBI's
first assistant director of the counter-terrorism division when it
was created in 1999, with responsibility for all international and
domestic terrorism programs as well as the National Infrastructure
Protection Center, which was established to fight cyber-terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI also is promoting Executive Assistant Director Bruce J.
Gebhardt to deputy director overseeing all investigative,
intelligence-gathering and operational matters.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller said the promotion of Gebhardt was part of a series of
initiatives to "refocus the priorities and investigative approaches
of the FBI" after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Gebhardt, who has been with the bureau for 28 years, headed the
FBI's San Francisco field office when Mueller was U.S. attorney
there. Mueller left San Francisco to take over as FBI director the
week before Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Investigates Metabolife Over Ephedrine Concerns</HD>
<DH>Health: The Justice Dept. questions whether the company
lied about the lack of complaints.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation to
determine whether San Diego-based Metabolife International lied when
it told the Food and Drug Administration that it had received no
reports of adverse health effects caused by its bestselling
weight-loss product, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   News of the FDA's request for an investigation prompted the
company's lawyers to announce Thursday that they were immediately and
voluntarily releasing records of more than 13,000 health complaints
the company had received since 1997 from consumers of Metabolife 356,
which contains the herbal stimulant ephedrine.</LD>
<LD>   Washington attorney Lanny Davis said the company also was taking
the "unusual step of asking to be regulated, asking for a mandatory
reporting system" of health complaints. In addition, Davis said, the
company was offering to donate 5 cents per bottle of Metabolife 356
sold--roughly $500,000 a year--to help finance a public education
campaign and studies on ephedrine's health effects.</LD>
<TE>   But Dr. Lester Crawford, FDA deputy commissioner, called the
company's action "disingenuous," noting that the agency had been
trying to get ephedrine side-effect information from the
$16.8-billion-a-year dietary supplement industry since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Metabolife has refused and resisted us every step of the way,"
Crawford said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the FDA began receiving reports of heart attacks,
seizures, strokes and other health problems associated with the use
of products from the ephedra plant, also known as the Chinese herb ma
huang. The FDA has since collected reports of more than 100 deaths
among users of products containing ephedrine, whose molecular
structure is very similar to that of amphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Various sports organizations, including the NFL, the NCAA and the
International Olympic Committee, ban ephedrine.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's repeated efforts to limit use of the herb in dietary
supplements have been blocked by the industry's high-powered lobbying
efforts and by Congress, Crawford noted.</TE>
<TE>   Because ephedra is a plant, products using it can be marketed as
an all-natural food supplement rather than a drug. Federal law
prohibits regulation of such supplements except in cases where the
FDA can prove the products are dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   The public-interest group Public Citizen, which first asked the
Department of Health and Human Services to ban ephedra products last
year, repeated that call Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I urge you to free yourself from the influences that Metabolife
and other ephedra makers have had on the Texas Department of Health
and their continued massive lobbying in Washington against a ban of
these most dangerous 'food supplements,' " wrote Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe,
director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, in a letter
Thursday to HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported last year that public health officials in Texas
had suspended the enforcement of a state regulation that would have
required products containing ephedrine to include a label with a
toll-free number for consumers to report suspected side effects to
the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department investigation of Metabolife is likely to
center on the company's own records and a letter written to the FDA
by then-company President Michael Ellis in 1998. Ellis is still on
the company's board.</TE>
<TE>   "Metabolife has never received one notice from a consumer that any
serious adverse health event has occurred because of the ingestion of
Metabolife 356," Ellis told agency officials, adding that the company
had received "no serious adverse reports of any sort."</TE>
<TE>   Davis said Thursday that the company had received a subpoena last
week to turn over records related to that 1998 letter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Metabolife began including a toll-free number on the
product label, inviting customers to call with questions about weight
loss. In five years, the line received more than 400,000 calls,
according to the company.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first year or so of the phone line's operation, the
company had "no regular system" to keep track of questions or
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   In late 1998, Metabolife hired registered nurses to take the
calls, and in 1999 the company devised a form on which to record the
callers' complaints. Last year Metabolife hired three outside experts
to analyze the data, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   In the more than 13,000 calls the firm received over five years
containing the word "health," about 80 callers mentioned seizure,
stroke, heart attack or death. About 120 more referred to
hospitalization, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company instructed the nurses to encourage such
callers to see a doctor and to stop taking the supplements,
Metabolife did not report the information to the FDA or follow up
with its customers. The company was not required by law to do so, and
it "didn't know if what they said was true" or if the health problems
were caused by the company's product, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The federal health department in June short-circuited the FDA's
latest anti-ephedrine efforts by hiring the Rand Corp., a think tank,
to review scientific data on ephedrine and adverse side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Metabolife International was founded in 1995 by Ellis, a former
police officer. The privately held company said in 1999 that annual
sales topped $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1999 Metabolife recalled its nationally distributed energy
bars because of concerns of toxic levels of vitamin A. Last month,
the Internal Revenue Service seized documents as part of a
tax-evasion inquiry.</TE>

<HD>Flipper Flap Grips Ga. Swim Club</HD>
<DH>Sports: A disabled teen's parents threatened to sue after
fin was ruled illegal for competition. Board relents, then all of its
members quit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>A teenager's use of a flipper on his prosthetic leg has churned up
controversy in his swimming league, including the resignations of all
the league's board members and the threat of a federal lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   Parents of other children say Hunter Scott swims faster since he
started strapping the flipper on his left leg. Hunter, an athletic
and growing teenager, said it just helps his balance and doesn't put
other swimmers at a disadvantage.</LD>
<LD>   "Without it, my body tends to roll in the water," he said
Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's helped me out a lot, but not because it's a
propulsion device."</TE>
<TE>   A birth defect stopped development in Hunter's thigh bone, and
doctors had to remove his foot when he was 2. Now 14, he swims, plays
baseball and hockey and lifts weights.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter started using the flipper last summer, his eighth year in
the Roswell River Rats swim club. De Kalb Atlanta Swim League
officials say he's about 4 seconds faster since using the flipper.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, after a coach questioned the flipper, the league's
board decided such a device was not permitted by USA Swimming, the
sport's governing body. The league told Hunter he couldn't use the
flipper in competition.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter's parents threatened to sue the board and its members under
the Americans With Disabilities Act and seek an injunction to halt
divisional and championship competition.</TE>
<TE>   The board decided to allow Hunter to use the flipper this year and
will set rules on such equipment next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Then, worried about future lawsuits and angered by the
controversy, all 10 board members resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter used the flipper in the championships in July; he finished
fifth in the 100-meter freestyle and ninth in the 50-meter butterfly.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, when he was losing, it was, 'Oh your son is so
inspirational,' " said his mother, Amanda. "And this year he started
winning, and suddenly people had an issue with his leg."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said his improvement came from weightlifting and growth,
not the flipper.</TE>
<TE>   USA Swimming's rules for the disabled match those of the
International Paralympic Committee, said Anneliese Eggert, secretary
of the national group's rules committee.</TE>
<TE>   Disabled swimmers "compete with what they have. We don't judge
them on what they don't have," Eggert said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you start allowing artificial means, then you're opening it up
to a kid who says, 'I'm not as tall as this guy so I should be able
to put flippers on.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, a ninth-grader, plans to try out for his high school's
swim team. The flipper has been approved by the Georgia High School
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Atlanta swim league, whose membership
includes 3,000 children, is in limbo, former President Mike McCarter
said.</TE>
<TE>   It is operated by volunteers, and no one has stepped forward to
run things since the board resigned.</TE>
<TE>   The board has no liability protection against lawsuits, meaning
members could have been responsible for any damage awards.</TE>
<TE>   The league's $7,000 bank balance wasn't even enough to contest the
threatened injunction, former board member Patty Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Money, a former board member and coach, said the flipper is
now less important than the lawsuit threat.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anyone's trying to pick on him because he's
handicapped," Money said. "It's just that when you threaten people,
things get ugly."</TE>

<HD>Glacier-Formed Dam Springs Major Leak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>A dam formed by the advancing Hubbard Glacier in southeastern Alaska
has sprung a giant leak, releasing a torrent of water and ice from
70-square-mile Russell Lake, scientists said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Glaciologist Dennis Trabant, who was in Yakutat with a state
emergency services team, estimated the flow into the sea at about
300,000 cubic feet per second, equal to at least three-fourths the
flow of the Yukon River.</LD>
<LD>   "The water is absolutely cascading out," Trabant said. "It's one
heck of a lot of water."</LD>
<TE>   Trabant said he and others hovered in a helicopter near the top of
the 300-foot-tall glacier at midday, looking down on the area where
the Hubbard had pushed a gravelly moraine hard against Gilbert Point
more than three weeks ago, creating Russell Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of moraine, however, they saw a raging river roughly 300
feet wide and 600 to 700 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely roiling and boiling, chaotic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The lake's level had risen steadily since the glacier and its
moraine started pinching off the entrance to Russell Fiord in late
June. The rate increased when the moraine sealed off the fiord, and
it spurted in the last week as heavy rains fell.</TE>
<TE>   The lake rose more than 3 feet Tuesday, cresting at about 61 feet
above sea level. But then the lake began overflowing the moraine,
eroding it, until it let go Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say the Hubbard is on a slow advance and eventually
will close off the mouth of Russell Fiord.</TE>
<TE>   That would cause the newly formed lake, fed by snowmelt and
rainfall, to rise in the mountainous basin around the fiord until it
overflows into the Situk River, wrecking prized steelhead and salmon
sport and commercial fisheries that are the backbone of the Yakutat
economy.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of that happening prompted Yakutat city and borough
officials to ask Gov. Tony Knowles to help them begin planning for an
economic disaster. Knowles responded by sending in a team headed by
Maj. Gen. Phil Oates, Alaska's adjutant general, to evaluate the
situation.</TE>

<HD>Ted Turner Drops Suit, Donates Land</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. HELENA ISLAND, S.C.</DL>
<LD>Billionaire Ted Turner agreed Thursday to drop his lawsuit against a
group of Gullah descendants and donate 68 disputed sea island acres
to the heirs.</LD>
<LD>   Turner had drawn criticism for suing the Gullah, slave descendants
who maintain vestiges of African speech and customs but who have been
squeezed off many of the islands they once dominated.</LD>
<LD>   "He understands that this bond of community cannot be preserved
unless people stay together, and they cannot stay together unless
they have land where they can gather," read a statement issued by
attorneys for both sides.</LD>
<TE>   Turner had sued Lands End Woodland Inc., a club formed by the
Gullah heirs to protect their 328-acre inheritance on St. Helena
Island off Beaufort. Turner spokeswoman Maura Donlan said that he
initially didn't know Lands End was connected to the Gullah and that
he directed his attorneys to settle the matter once he found out.</TE>
<TE>   The woodland club was formed in 1994 by descendants of 47 blacks
who pooled their money in 1920 to buy an old plantation on the
island. The land had always been treated as a community asset, where
people could hunt, fish or hold family gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   Turner purchased neighboring St. Phillips Island and a 298-acre
landing area on St. Helena in 1979. His attorneys said Turner was
unaware of any boundary dispute until recently.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, the heirs agreed to acknowledge that
Turner had a legitimate legal claim to the disputed acres, and that
Turner's giving up of that claim is a charitable donation.</TE>

<DL>ABILENE, Texas</DL>
<LD>Former prison guard Paula Lynn Roach was arraigned Thursday for
allegedly kidnapping a 1-month-old Texas girl from a Wal-Mart parking
lot and dragging her mother across the pavement as she desperately
clung to Roach's car.</LD>
<LD>   Roach, 24, told a judge she understood the charges against her and
under Texas law could face a term of five years to 99 years in prison
if convicted of aggravated kidnapping. Bail was set at $200,000.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Aide of Elder Bush to Head Florida's Child Welfare
Agency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Gov. Jeb Bush on Thursday named a former aide in his father's
presidential administration to head Florida's beleaguered child
welfare agency.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Regier, 57, will replace Kathleen A. Kearney, who quit
Tuesday as secretary of the Department of Children &amp; Families.</LD>
<LD>   The resignation follows widespread and highly publicized problems
in the department, including losing track of foster children, leaving
children in abusive situations and caseworkers falsifying reports.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a daunting task and a daunting day," said Regier, who
will be paid $150,000 a year, a hefty increase over Kearney's salary
of $112,797.</TE>
<TE>   Regier served as Oklahoma's secretary for social services for five
years, completing his tenure in January. He also worked in Washington
in social service posts for both President Reagan and the elder
President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry's professional experience has been dedicated to improving
the quality of life for children and families," Gov. Bush said. "With
the experience he has gained in Oklahoma, Jerry is well equipped to
handle the challenges currently facing DCF."</TE>
<TE>   Regier had been working with the state for several weeks to help
it with its child welfare crisis, but he said he did not come to
Florida looking for a job. Bush said Regier was just one of many
people nationally who offered to help solve the department's
problems.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has been under fire since it was revealed that
5-year-old Rilya Wilson disappeared while in state custody and that
no caseworker checked on her for 15 months. The Miami girl has been
missing since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Regier worked for Bush's father as head of the National Office of
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   He was appointed to the National Commission on Children by Reagan
in 1988 and was reappointed by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no one that's a miracle worker," Regier said. "We're
going to go to work on this, we're going to have openness, and I
believe that's going to carry us forward."</TE>

<HD>Cops, Firefighters Demand Raises</HD>
<DH>Protest: Thousands who protect New York City rally in Times
Square, saying Sept. 11 heroics already are forgotten.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Invoking the sacrifices made on Sept. 11, thousands of off-duty
police officers and firefighters jammed Times Square on Thursday to
pressure the city to meet their demands for higher pay.</LD>
<LD>   Some chanted, "Too much praise, too little raise," and carried
placards saying, "They say, 'Never forget.' We say, 'Already
forgotten.' "</LD>
<LD>   "All of these politicians were at ground zero talking about how
much we were worth," said firefighter Kevin Roth, who was part of the
throng. "Eleven months later, it's business as usual."</LD>
<TE>   The two-hour rally was organized by the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Assn. and the Uniformed Firefighters Assn. Beginning New York
firefighters earn $32,724 a year, and starting police officers
$31,305.</TE>
<TE>   Police union members--whose contract expired July 31, 2000--have
been upset over reports that a state arbitration panel might approve
a two-year contract that includes an increase in workdays.</TE>
<TE>   Reports said the contract would include annual 5% raises; the
union wants a 23% pay increase over two years.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters have been without a pay raise for 40 months.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said he would like to pay police
and firefighters more but is hampered by a $5-billion budget
shortfall.</TE>

<HD>30 Homes Evacuated Near Oregon Fire</HD>
<DH>Blaze: Precautionary move is taken as the largest such
outbreak in the state's history, at nearly 400,000 acres, is being
contained.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>About 30 homes were evacuated three miles south of Agness Thursday
evening as flames from the Biscuit fire came within a mile of the
neighborhood of Oak Flats.</LD>
<LD>   "The fire hasn't blown up," said fire spokesman Dick Fleishman.
"But it's progressing that way, and the [Curry County] sheriff
thought it would be safer to evacuate during the day than at night."</LD>
<LD>   National Guard troops were guarding the roads leading to the
communities--Oak Flats and Spud Road--to keep residents from
re-entering.</LD>
<TE>   The evacuees, more than 60 people, were sent to Riley Creek School
in Gold Beach, said Fleishman.</TE>
<TE>   In other troublesome areas of the massive Biscuit fire, now
burning on almost 400,000 acres, crews are making solid progress,
fire officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Wind-borne embers had been sparking small fires near Quail Prairie
Mountain, on the southwestern flank of the fire near Brookings. But
crews were able to do some burning-out in the area Thursday, fire
information officer Mark Wilkening said, and were able to shore up
lines built to stop the fire in its tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Structural firefighters from around the state, summoned by Gov.
John Kitzhaber in his record 10th use of the Emergency Conflagration
Act this year, were headed to the Chetco River area, around the
fire's southwestern tip, to help evaluate fire danger to homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   The Biscuit fire is now the largest recorded fire in Oregon
history, burning primarily in the Siskiyou National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The fire has burned for a month since a lightning strike ignited
it deep in the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. With 6,848 people assembled
from around the country, as well as Canada, New Zealand and
Australia, the fire has cost $62.6 million to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Five contract firefighters injured when the driver of their pickup
apparently fell asleep and ran off U.S. Highway 199 near O'Brien had
been sent home, Wilkening said.</TE>
<TE>   The injured firefighters were part of a three-truck convoy driving
from Salem to a fire camp in Brookings, state police Senior Trooper
Randall Hoxsie said. They were treated and released from a local
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time this summer members of a firefighting crew
from Ferguson Management Co. of Albany were injured.</TE>
<TE>   The Biscuit fire was 28% contained, with the most secure lines on
the eastern and southern flanks. The threat to the 17,000 residents
of the Illinois Valley diminished, but an evacuation notice remained
in effect.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in Oregon, the East Antelope Fire grew in size to 1,550
acres and curled around the southeast slopes of Grizzly Peak. Flames
could be seen 4 1/2 miles away in Ashland, home of the Oregon
Shakespeare Festival. The fire was sparked Tuesday by power lines
sagging into tree limbs.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look like the fire will move toward the town of
Ashland," said Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Dennis Turco.</TE>

<HD>Workers Return to Pentagon Offices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. and Marine Corps flags stood again in the corner of Peter
Murphy's Pentagon office, and the blue and red carpet was immaculate.
It was almost as if the clock had been turned back to 9 a.m. Sept.
11, just before the plane hit.</LD>
<LD>   The office on the Pentagon's outer ring was destroyed in the
terrorist attack. On Thursday, Murphy and 21 others became the first
to move back into their rebuilt work spaces, as Pentagon renovation
officials began making good on their promise to have workers back at
their desks at the point of impact by the one-year anniversary of the
attack.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of a twilight zone almost," said Murphy, counsel for
the commandant of the Marine Corps, walking into the office. "It's a
strange sensation, coming back to an office you could have been
killed in."</LD>
<TE>   By Sept. 11, when a memorial service attended by President Bush is
set, officials expect to have 600 people working in the outer E-ring
section where the hijacked jetliner hit. More than 2,000 other
workers have already returned to less damaged areas.</TE>
<TE>   Movers wheeled in boxes and furniture Thursday, including Murphy's
antique desk--a gift from a former commandant that somehow survived.
In the hallway, workers were adjusting fluorescent lights or waiting
to hook up computers and telephones.</TE>

<HD>Grads Take a Pass on Military</HD>
<DH>Recruits: An ad boost fails to lure many away from college,
study finds. Better wages are urged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHELLE MUNN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Despite a threefold increase in advertising in recent years, efforts
by the U.S. military to bolster its recruitment ranks are bearing
little fruit, a study released Thursday found.</LD>
<LD>   The desire by high school graduates to pursue college is thwarting
the military's ability to attract the youngsters it needs to grow--or
even maintain--its ranks, according to the report by the National
Research Council, a nonprofit think tank.</LD>
<LD>   A high-flying economy through much of the 1990s may explain some
of the lack of interest, the report said. But as the economy sputters
and patriotism surges in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, there has
been no corresponding uptick in military enlistment.</LD>
<TE>   "Even with the instability in the economy and the loss of civilian
jobs in many sectors in 2000-2001, interest in the military has not
increased," according to the report, which was commissioned by the
Department of Defense. The number of Americans on active duty
dwindled to 1.2 million in 2000, down from 1.7 million in 1990 and
2.3 million in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   To counter this decline, the report--written by a panel of 15
experts in demography, military sociology and psychology--recommends
that the Department of Defense find new ways to allow recruits to
attend college while serving in the military. In the early 1970s,
fewer than half of high school seniors went to college, but by 1999,
63% were enrolling in college the same year they graduated from high
school, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "Delaying college is seen as less and less attractive," said Paul
R. Sackett, the panel chairman and a professor of psychology at the
University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 200,000 new recruits are needed each year to maintain
the active force for all four branches of the military, according to
the findings. To sustain that level, the military should concentrate
on paying competitive wages, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   "Research indicates that regular military compensation is less
than what similarly qualified individuals with some college could
earn in the civilian labor market and markedly less than the earnings
of college graduates," the report concludes.</TE>
<TE>   Before enlisting in service, youths rate military pay as
comparable to the corporate world. But once enlisted, just 16.5% of
recruits say they are satisfied with their basic pay, compared to 59%
of employees at Fortune 100 companies, the report found.</TE>
<TE>   Those findings are particularly troublesome in light of the
increase in the age of military personnel and the declining interest
among high school males in joining the military. Between 1980 and
1997, the average age of active-duty personnel increased from 25 to
27. And the percentage of high school males who said they will
"definitely" join the military declined from 12% in the mid-1980s to
8%.</TE>
<TE>   Military officials and analysts say the number of people seeking
to join the military appears largely unaffected by the terrorist
attacks. The Army has met its goals of about 80,000 new recruits each
of the last three years, but these targets are lower than in years
past. Its 1983 goal was 145,000.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Sheriff Given Life Term for Murder of Rival</HD>
<DH>Georgia: Sidney Dorsey, who arranged the slaying of Derwin
Brown on Dec. 15, 2000, days before victim was to take office, also
draws 23 years on corruption charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Georgia judge sentenced a former county sheriff to life in prison
Thursday for killing his successor nearly two years ago in a
desperate attempt to cover up corruption.</LD>
<LD>   Sidney Dorsey, formerly sheriff of De Kalb County, was found
guilty last month of arranging the killing of Derwin Brown, a veteran
police officer who defeated him in a runoff election Aug. 8, 2000.</LD>
<LD>   On Dec. 15, 2000, as the 46-year-old Brown was returning home from
a pre-Christmas party, he was hit by a dozen bullets and later died.
The attack came three days before he was to assume office.</LD>
<TE>   "I have heard evidence of the many good things you did while
sheriff," Superior Judge Cynthia Becker told Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, the things you did that were corrupt ... cast a
blemish and a pall on that department."</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey, 63, called himself an "innocent man," saying, "I do not
have the blood of the sheriff-elect on my hands."</TE>
<TE>   The audacious killing and the trial that followed drew national
attention as a textbook case of official corruption as the Albany,
Ga., jury added counts of racketeering, theft and violation of oath
of office to the murder conviction. Becker sentenced Dorsey to 23
years on the corruption charges.</TE>
<TE>   The trial was moved to Albany, 180 miles south of Atlanta, after a
judge decided publicity made finding a fair jury there impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had portrayed Dorsey as a "panicking man" who arranged
the murder to conceal numerous irregularities, including using
sheriff's office personnel to staff his personal security business
and to run errands for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Sidney Dorsey stole a little bit every day," Chief Assistant
Dist. Atty. John Petrey told the jury. "The assassination of Derwin
Brown was a desperate move by a panicking man whose fool's paradise
was being snatched from him."</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers painted a picture of Dorsey as a public official
who may have made some bad decisions but was not a killer, asserting
that two other people involved in the murder plot had acted alone.</TE>
<TE>   Before sentencing, Brown's son Marlin Robinson took the witness
stand, saying, "My father was murdered in hopes of concealing
wrongdoings."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff-elect's widow, Phyllis, also testified and urged a
tough sentence: "I don't have anything left but a nameplate."</TE>
<TE>   Brown's mother, Burkena, told the court that "there is a hole
where my heart used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Before sentencing, Dorsey told Becker he believed the jurors would
reject the prosecution's case.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought that an innocent man would be convicted of a
crime he didn't do," the former sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know you are going to sentence me severely," Dorsey said. "But
I do not have the blood of Derwin Brown on my hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I am going to be in prison on the outside, but I'll be free on
the inside because I do not have the blood of the sheriff-elect on my
hands.... I did not play a role in the diabolical and horrible
murder."</TE>
<TE>   With a note of resignation in his voice, he added: "Here I am."</TE>
<TE>   Turning to the corruption conviction, he said he never intended to
steal.</TE>
<TE>   In imposing the sentence, Becker said Dorsey breached his
fiduciary duties as a public official, noting he even sent sheriff's
deputies to take his family to Disney World in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "Words cannot express the magnitude of this case," Dist. Atty. J.
Tom Morgan said when the sentencing hearing was over. "A sworn
official, an elected official, used the power of his position to
order the assassination of another elected official."</TE>

<HD>Teachers Use Social Security Loophole</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 4,800 public school teachers in Texas and Georgia used a
Social Security loophole to qualify for increased benefits that
during their lifetimes could total $450 million, congressional
investigators said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Benefits are usually payable to the spouses of retired, disabled
or deceased workers covered by Social Security. A 1977 law reduced
those spousal benefits for state and local government workers who
also receive a pension from work not covered by Social Security.</LD>
<LD>   But the law allows workers to avoid that reduction in benefits if
they are covered by both Social Security and their government pension
during their last day on the job, the General Accounting Office said
in a report.</LD>
<TE>   The investigators said 4,795 teachers in Texas and 24 in Georgia
have used this loophole, transferring briefly to jobs covered by
Social Security before retiring.</TE>
<TE>   In Texas, the teachers typically worked a single day in clerical
or maintenance jobs before retiring, paying about $3 in Social
Security taxes, the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   In Georgia, teachers worked a year in another teaching position in
a school district covered by Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in both states told the GAO that use of the exemption
would likely grow as more people become aware of it, the report said.
Teaching associations and Web sites have been spreading information
on how to use the exemption, the GAO said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigators said they did not have time to confirm whether
government workers outside Texas and Georgia were using the loophole,
but the exemption could be used in about 2,300 government retirement
plans in other states.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO said Congress should change the rules by setting a longer
minimum working period.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Reports 4 Suicide Attempts at Cuba Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</DL>
<LD>Four terrorism suspects being held at the U.S. naval base in
Guantanamo Bay tried to kill themselves in their cells, a military
official said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   One man tried to slash his wrists with a plastic razor, and three
others tried to hang themselves with "comfort items" at Camp Delta,
the prison in eastern Cuba where 598 men are being held, said Army
Lt. Col. Joe Hoey, a detention mission spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   The suicide attempts occurred in July and August, but military
spokesmen gave no details on exactly what they used or how seriously
they were hurt. Comfort items include towels and sheets.</LD>
<TE>   "All of these men are monitored very closely, and their attempts
were not successful," Hoey told Associated Press. Hoey said all four
had returned to their cells.</TE>
<TE>   Since the first detainees arrived in January, none have been
charged by the U.S. government, which says it may try them in
military tribunals, send them home or hold them indefinitely. The
detainees are being interrogated and are not allowed lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   The legal limbo has outraged human rights activists and
psychologists who say the uncertainty the men face is unbearable and
counterproductive to interrogators seeking information.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you're in that condition, you're not rational," said
psychiatrist Stuart Grassian of Harvard University, an expert on the
affects of long-term confinement in maximum-security conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Leaving people in confinement, or pushing them to the breaking
point, won't necessarily improve the ability to get information,"
Grassian said. "When people break, a lot of times it isn't in a way
that's particularly useful to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of detainees, who represent 38 countries, have staged
hunger strikes to protest their indefinite detentions. Others are
being treated for psychological disorders and several are being
medicated with antidepressants or anti-psychotic drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the men have made statements that they wanted to die or
kill themselves, Hoey said, and several others have tried to harm
themselves, but the actions were not considered suicide attempts.</TE>

<HD>$100-Trillion Lawsuit Over 9/11 Targets Saudis</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Families of victims seek to sever the pipeline
that funds Al Qaeda. The case may complicate broader campaign by the
U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>More than 600 relatives of Sept. 11 terrorism victims filed a lawsuit
Thursday that accuses seven foreign banks, eight Islamic foundations
and three members of the Saudi royal family of financing Osama bin
Laden and his terrorist network.</LD>
<LD>   The relatives said their lawsuit, which seeks more than $100
trillion, aims to crush the financial pipeline that supports
terrorism. The suit also names as defendants the Sudanese government
and the Saudi construction conglomerate run by Bin Laden's family.</LD>
<LD>   "We will leave them high and dry, their bankrollers broke and
bereft," said William Doyle, whose son worked at the World Trade
Center.</LD>
<TE>   "We will expose for the world the shady underbelly behind the
atrocities of 9/11," said Thomas E. Burnett Sr., whose son died
aboard the hijacked jetliner that crashed in rural Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government is conducting its own effort to freeze the
assets of businesses and charities that support terrorism. But the
lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia,
could complicate the Bush administration's broader war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   It comes while U.S. officials are working to maintain relations
with Saudi Arabia as they consider an attack on its neighbor Iraq.
Saudi officials object to any notion that their nation fosters
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   To probe Bin Laden's financial supports, lawyers for the
plaintiffs said they hired their own investigators, including
Jean-Charles Brisard, co-author of a controversial French bestseller
that claims Saudi Arabia played as big a role in the spread of
Islamic terrorism as did the Taliban, which offered Bin Laden
protection in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I had nothing against the Saudis, but that's where the evidence
pointed," said Allan Gerson, a lead lawyer for the families.</TE>
<TE>   They found what they described as a series of financial ties
between the Saudis and Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network in
which the money flowed in one direction--to Bin Laden. "This is an
insidious group of people," plaintiff's lawyer Ron Motley told a news
conference, referring to the Saudis.</TE>
<TE>   Gerson, of Washington, counseled many of the families who sued
Libya after the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland. This year, lawyers announced a deal in which each of the
families would get $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Motley, of South Carolina, successfully sued the asbestos industry
and represented states in their legal triumph over the tobacco
industry.</TE>
<TE>   The money from the terrorism suit, if successful, is expected to
come from assets held in the U.S. by the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the allegations in the terrorism lawsuit have
appeared previously in news reports, the suit does not disclose the
documents or other specific evidence that may underlie many of its
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, aiming directly at the Saudi royal family, says that
the former chief of the Saudi Secret Services, Prince Turki al Faisal
al Saud, helped broker a 1998 deal in which Saudi Arabia agreed not
to seek the extradition of Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members from
Afghanistan, or the closing of terrorist camps there, in return for
Bin Laden's agreement not to use the infrastructure in Afghanistan to
undermine the Saudi government.</TE>
<TE>   "Prince Turki also promised to provide oil and generous financial
assistance to both the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan," the
lawsuit continues. "After the [1998] meeting, 400 new pickup trucks
arrived in Kandahar for the Taliban, still bearing Saudi Arabia
license plates." Kandahar, a city in Afghanistan, was a Taliban
stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   In accusations against a second member of the Saudi royal family,
the lawsuit says that since 1994, Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz al
Saud, a brother of King Fahd, donated at least $6 million to
charities that provided financing to Al Qaeda--a charge that has not
been widely chronicled in the media.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit says Prince Sultan should have known the character of
the charities because he headed the Saudi council that reviews aid
requests from Islamic groups. Prince Sultan is also Saudi Arabia's
second deputy prime minister and minister of defense and aviation.</TE>
<TE>   A third member of the royal family, Mohammed al Faisal al Saud, is
cited as chairman of firms that owned shares of a Sudanese bank that
allegedly supported Bin Laden's activities. The lawsuit claims that
Prince Mohammed is also the former chairman of a Swiss charity that
is "involved in Al Qaeda financing through several subsidiaries."</TE>
<TE>   A Saudi press official in Washington declined to comment on the
lawsuit. But Saudi officials have strenuously denied accusations that
they have supported terrorism or been slow to combat it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are fighting communism, we are fighting terrorism, we are
working assiduously with the United States in this regard," the Saudi
foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said in an Aug. 11 interview
with ABC television. "We have a committee on which we share
information. We have a committee that also deals with the freezing of
the assets of anybody who finances this terror. And in spite of all
these things, we're still accused of aiding the terrorism that is
against Saudi Arabia."</TE>
<TE>   Under U.S. law, foreign governments have a broad, though not
unlimited, immunity from lawsuits, including those alleging
cooperation in wrongful deaths. Several lawyers said that immunity
likely did not apply in this case, however, because the actions
occurred on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Congress set more liberal terms for suing nations
designated by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism, a list
that includes Sudan. It is unclear whether members of the Saudi royal
family could successfully argue that their government roles confer
some type of immunity.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials would not comment on the lawsuit
Thursday. But spokesman Philip Reeker said the department was "fully
and very satisfied with the support we've gotten from Saudi Arabia in
the many aspects of this war against terrorism--the financial
aspects, the intelligence and information sharing, the law
enforcement actions--in doing that."</TE>
<TE>   Still, relations with Saudi Arabia have been strained in recent
months. The Bush administration is planning for a possible effort to
topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, but Saudi officials say they
would not join a war.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens, a fact
that has prompted criticism from some Americans but that the Saudis
say was a deliberate attempt by Bin Laden's group to drive a wedge
between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit accuses the government of Sudan of fostering Al Qaeda
during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obvious that Sudan has not been involved in any way in the
tragic incidents or attacks on Sept. 11," said Abdelbagi Kabeir,
deputy chief of mission at the Sudanese embassy in Washington. "We
have not got any citizens involved. We were not linked in any way."</TE>

<HD>Outrageous Rugs Make It a 'Night for Traficant'</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NILES, Ohio</DL>
<LD>And you thought James A. Traficant Jr.'s rug was unusual.</LD>
<LD>   The minor league ballpark in this northeast Ohio city was full of
tired toupees and wilted wigs Wednesday night as the Mahoning Valley
Scrappers celebrated James Traficant Night.</LD>
<LD>   About 150 of the 4,700 baseball fans got free admission by wearing
ugly wigs or declaring themselves to be "a son of a truck driver,"
the colorful ex-congressman's favorite self-description.</LD>
<TE>   Fans also took part in skits, including one in which a man dressed
as an FBI agent chased a man dressed as Traficant around the field.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant's trademark shock of spiky gray hair is a toupee, jail
officials revealed earlier this month after he was sentenced for
corruption and taken away in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   As if being thrown out of Congress and sentenced to eight years
wasn't bad enough, he's not allowed to wear the rug in federal
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Fan Danielle Devan wore an orange jumpsuit, handcuffs and a fuzzy
black-and-white hat for hair, while another fan printed bumper
stickers proclaiming "Free Jim," claiming he sold about 100 at $2 a
pop.</TE>
<TE>   The Cafaro family, whose company built the minor league ballpark
Cafaro Field, has a more than passing interest in Traficant. J. J.
Cafaro was one of the lead prosecution witnesses against him,
testifying he bribed the congressman with cash and favors.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the Mahoning Valley Scrappers edged out the
Jamestown (N.Y.) Jammers, 9-8.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LITTLETON, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The West Nile virus' westward march has apparently reached Colorado,
where health officials reported four animal cases Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   If the cases are confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Colorado would become the 38th and westernmost state to
report the mosquito-borne virus this year.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Julie Gerberding, the CDC director, has said birds and
mosquitoes could spread the virus to the Pacific Coast. The CDC lists
160 confirmed or probable human cases of the disease and nine deaths
so far this year.</LD>
<TE>   New York, which had the first U.S. cases of West Nile three years
ago, reported its first human case of 2002 on Thursday in New York
City. Illinois health officials reported three new human cases of the
virus, all in the Chicago area.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado health officials said a crow and two horses tested
positive for West Nile in Weld County, just south of Cheyenne, Wyo. A
third horse was found with the disease in southeastern Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been something we have known is coming," said Dr. Ned
Calonge, the state's acting chief medical officer.</TE>
<TE>   The virus was first detected in the United States in 1999. From
that year through 2001, the CDC confirmed 149 human cases and 18
deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Most people who get it see mild flulike symptoms, or no symptoms
at all. But it can cause encephalitis, a potentially fatal swelling
of the brain, especially in older people and people with weakened
immune systems.</TE>

<HD>NASA Loses Signal of Contour Craft as It Was to Leave Earth
Orbit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>NASA lost contact with a $159-million spacecraft Thursday, when the
robotic probe was to have left Earth orbit on a years-long journey to
explore several comets.</LD>
<LD>   The mission's operations team was seeking to regain communication
with the Contour spacecraft, which was supposed to automatically fire
its solid-rocket motor at 1:49 a.m. PDT to boost itself out of the
orbit.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, the octagonal spacecraft was about 140 miles above
the Indian Ocean and was too close to Earth and moving too fast for
NASA's Deep Space Network of antennas to track it.</LD>
<TE>   The network was to have picked up a signal from Contour 48 minutes
after the burn, as the spacecraft moved away from Earth. Instead, it
vanished.</TE>
<TE>   The giant dish antennas in California, Australia and Spain
continued to search for the spacecraft, alternately sending it
commands and listening for a response. Nothing was heard from
Contour--short for Comet Nucleus Tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess we are still certainly hoping this will turn out all
right. Spacecraft have been lost before and safely regained," said
Michael Belton, a member of the mission's science team.</TE>
<TE>   The mission's operations team looked for Contour at points along
the predicted paths that it was supposed to have taken. If the motor
did not fire, Contour would have remained stuck in Earth orbit.</TE>
<TE>   "They are operating on the assumption that the burn went as
planned," said Michael Buckley, a spokesman for Johns Hopkins
University's Applied Physics Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Johns Hopkins built the spacecraft, with assistance from Cornell
University, for NASA.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still some cautious optimism over there," Buckley added.</TE>
<TE>   The spacecraft had been in Earth orbit since its launch July 3,
looping around the planet every 42 hours on an elliptical path.</TE>

<HD>Scientist Plans Lab to Map Genes Swiftly and Inexpensively</HD>
<DH>DNA: Celera founder hopes to be able to decode a person's
genetic map in seconds for about $1,000 and make the process widely
available.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANHAM, Md.</DL>
<LD>J. Craig Venter, whose former company spent two years mapping human
DNA, unveiled plans Wednesday to open a research center that will be
capable of decoding a person's genes in seconds.</LD>
<LD>   He said he hopes the DNA sequencing, which now can take months and
costs millions of dollars, will be done for about $1,000. Making it
widely available could help doctors predict what diseases patients
may face and treat problems before they arise.</LD>
<LD>   "We're trying to get it so that millions of people can participate
in having this information change their lives," Venter said.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement marks a return to genetic research for Venter, a
usually outspoken biologist who has kept a relatively low profile
since he left his post as president of Celera Genomics in January.</TE>
<TE>   Venter founded Celera in 1998, promising to create a chart of the
human genetic structure in just a few years. It was a boast that
shook the genetics community and put Celera in a tight race with
federally funded researchers. Both completed the work in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Venter was ousted after the company shifted from selling genetic
information to drug development. Celera said it was looking for a
chief executive with drug company experience, which Venter lacked.</TE>
<TE>   Celera spokesman Rob Bennett said the company doesn't see Venter's
new plans as competition because Celera is moving away from genetic
sequencing.</TE>
<TE>   Venter no longer has ties to Celera, but he said his J. Craig
Venter Science Foundation still has a million options of Celera
stock.</TE>
<TE>   The new lab will be a collaboration between three research centers
supported by Venter's foundation, including the Institute for Genomic
Research, run by his wife, Claire Fraser. The Rockville institute,
known as TIGR, recently sequenced the genetic structure of anthrax
spores that were sent through the mail last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Venter predicted that the new Rockville-based lab will conduct 40
million genetic sequences next year, making it one of the nation's
busiest. Unlike Celera, which sold access to its genetic research,
Venter said the nonprofit lab would openly publish its findings.</TE>
<TE>   Venter's work will be a boost for genetics if he keeps that
promise, said Larry Thompson, a spokesman for the National Human
Genome Research Institute, which ran the federally funded project
that competed with Celera to complete the human genetic map.</TE>
<TE>   "Science isn't about press releases, science is about doing stuff
and putting it in the public sector so that the rest of the
scientific community can see it," Thompson said. "If Dr. Venter
contributes in that mode, his contributions will be welcomed."</TE>
<TE>   Federal scientists already have met to discuss the prospects of
working on a "thousand-dollar" genome project, but have not decided
whether to pursue that goal, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Venter said his new lab also will house research about whether
biological materials can be used as alternative fuel sources and
support Venter's interest in bioethics. He said he hopes to show
genetic sequencing still is on the cutting edge.</TE>
<TE>   "DNA sequencing is just at its infancy," he said. "If we get it to
where it is cost-effective to do it, it will be the main assay in all
of biology."</TE>

<HD>CSUCI Now Ready for Its Big Day</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Rehearsal runs smoothly for the main show today
when 1,500 guests, including governor, arrive for the opening
ceremony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The school's burgundy banners were all properly hung, the stage
microphones all set and the rows of white lawn chairs all arranged.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing missing was the 1,500 guests, including keynote
speaker Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   But Thursday was simply the dress rehearsal for the grand opening
ceremony for Cal State Channel Islands, Ventura County's first
four-year public university. The real ceremony is today.</LD>
<TE>   For the past few weeks more than 150 workers have been sprucing up
the campus and preparing for the big moment. At the center of all the
frenzied preparations is Nancy Covarrubias Gill, 41, the school's
associate director of development.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, Gill has been in charge of organizing the opening
celebration and making sure everything runs smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   It has been one of the biggest challenges in her career, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest task Thursday, however, was leading a giddy group of
about 50 faculty members, staff members and administrators in a dry
run of today's ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Gripping her walkie-talkie in one hand and her script in the
other, Gill quickly ran the group through an abbreviated version of
the event.</TE>
<TE>   She made sure everyone in the procession sat in their assigned
seat, that the microphones were properly adjusted for musicians and
that everyone followed the script.</TE>
<TE>   The practice session went fairly smoothly, though at times the
boisterous crowd heckled speakers and generally gave the event the
feel of a raucous wedding rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Channel Islands economics professor Dennis Muraoka
filled in for the governor. After being ''introduced'' by college
President Richard Rush, Muraoka told the audience he had prepared
some remarks.</TE>
<TE>   ''You've all done an outstanding job of getting this university
started,'' he said. ''Therefore, even though I have not signed the
budget, I am doubling all your salaries, and I am doubling all your
vacation time.''</TE>
<TE>   Laughing audience members began chanting, "Four more years! Four
more years!''</TE>
<TE>   Rush also received a share of heckling, and at one point joked
that if the governor received a security detail, he wanted one too.</TE>
<TE>   Today's ceremony culminates a four-year effort to convert the
former Camarillo State Hospital into the California State University
system's 23rd campus, ending Ventura County's decades-long wait for a
public university.</TE>
<TE>   The new school will welcome its first class Aug. 26. So far, about
1,300 transfer students have enrolled for the first year.</TE>
<TE>   By 2025, the university is expected to be operating at full
capacity, serving up to 15,000 students, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, all the attention will be focused on today's historic
pomp-filled opening celebration.</TE>
<TE>   ''It looks like we're in pretty good shape,'' Gill said. ''We're
ready for business.''</TE>

<HD>Youth Gets 50 to Life for Shootings</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge cites teen's remorse in rejecting 425-year
term for school rampage in which two died and 13 were wounded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After a day of emotional testimony by victims and their families, a
judge on Thursday sentenced 16-year-old Charles "Andy" Williams to 50
years to life in prison for killing two students and wounding 13
others in a shooting rampage last year at Santana High School.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors, victims and the victims' families begged the judge to
impose a maximum sentence of 425 years to life, which would have
precluded parole for Williams.</LD>
<LD>   But Superior Court Judge Herbert Exarhos noted that Williams has
shown remorse, pleaded guilty to spare his victims further agony and
had no previous criminal history. He also said the heavier sentence
would run counter to a portion of state law that forbids life
sentences for younger juvenile offenders.</LD>
<TE>   Williams sobbed as he spoke briefly before Exarhos imposed his
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "For what it's worth, I want everybody to know I'm sorry,"
Williams said. "I feel horrible about what happened. If I could go
back to that day, I would never have gotten out of bed."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Kris Anton had asked Exarhos for the maximum
term for two counts of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder.
School Principal Karen Degischer told Exarhos that Williams, who was
a 15-year-old freshman when he went on the six-minute rampage, should
be punished to the full extent of the law.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to see that justice is done so that the healing can
continue and the future for us is restored," Degischer said.</TE>
<TE>   Exarhos said Williams will be 65 before he is eligible for a
parole hearing. And he noted that the youth had been mistreated by
friends and suffered from depression and despair.</TE>
<TE>   While in Juvenile Hall, Williams has excelled in his studies,
learned the Japanese art of origami, and acted as a friend and mentor
to other troubled youths, according to the county Probation
Department. He also wrote a poem titled: "3/5/01," the date of the
attack:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was a kid</TE>
<TE>   Who had a gun</TE>
<TE>   He finally decided</TE>
<TE>   He had nothing to lose</TE>
<TE>   People all over</TE>
<TE>   Saw him on the news.</TE>
<TE>   Two people dead, 13 people hurt</TE>
<TE>   One stupid decision cut 3 lives short</TE>
<TE>   He is getting tried as an adult</TE>
<TE>   He is a 15-year-old kid</TE>
<TE>   He is sorry, he is sorry.</TE>
<TE>   He should never have done</TE>
<TE>   What he did.</TE>
<TE>   He thought nobody liked him</TE>
<TE>   He got messed with everyday ...</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shooting randomly with a gun owned by his father, Williams killed
Bryan Zuckor, 14, and Randy Gordon, 17, and wounded 11 other
students, a teacher and a campus security guard. He surrendered
meekly to police, saying he had planned to kill himself rather than
be arrested but lacked the nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "He stood near the bleeding, dying body of Bryan Zuckor and
reloaded and kept on shooting and shooting and shooting," Anton said.</TE>
<TE>   "I not only lost my best friend, Randy Gordon, I lost my
innocence, my security," said student Ray Serrato, who has a bullet
lodged in his back. "Fifty years is not enough."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Ruiz, a campus supervisor who was shot three times, called
Williams' apology empty words. Ruiz said he was disappointed by
Exarhos' decision because it could mean he and other victims will
have to attend parole hearings to keep Williams in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who since the attack has grown from a short, thin youth
into a 6-footer on the verge of manhood, had plotted the attack with
two friends on the previous weekend. But the friends decided to back
out without telling their parents or authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Williams and his father, Jeff, an employee of the Balboa Naval
Hospital, had recently moved to Santee, a blue-collar suburb east of
San Diego. Williams had trouble adjusting to Santana High and fell in
with a hard-edged group of teenagers who frequented a local skate
park.</TE>
<TE>   He began smoking marijuana, skipping school and doing poorly in
his classes. "Andy soon began to experience abuse from these
so-called friends," said defense attorney Randy Mize. "He had no clue
on how to cope with it."</TE>
<TE>   Anton noted that the bullying was not done at school and that
Williams could have escaped merely by not going to the skate park.
She also downplayed the severity of the bullying, characterizing the
towel-snapping, roughhousing and name-calling as common among rowdy,
cynical teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "When you take those actions in perspective," Anton said, "who is
the bully in this case? The defendant is the bully. He took a gun to
school and shot innocent kids."</TE>
<TE>   Mize submitted letters from family friends in Twentynine Palms and
Brunswick, Md., telling of Williams as a happy youth who excelled in
school and sports and attended church regularly. Psychiatrists who
interviewed him at Juvenile Hall said he is unlikely ever to commit
another crime.</TE>
<TE>   Victims and family members told of physical pain, psychological
torment and an overwhelming sense of fear left by the attack. Many
are in counseling; others have had difficulty returning to school.</TE>
<TE>   "I forgive him, but that doesn't take away the pain that is still
inside," said student Karla Leyva, who was wounded. "I forgive him,
but that doesn't take away the fear of walking down the street and
hearing a loud noise."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' father and mother, long divorced, attended the hearing
in the El Cajon branch of the Superior Court. They did not speak on
behalf of their son, instead designating a family friend to speak for
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Hating Andy will not make your lives happier," said Terri
Burdett, whose son, Williams' best friend, was killed in a bus
accident just weeks before the shooting. The loss of his friend sent
Williams into an emotional tailspin.</TE>
<TE>   Exarhos said that even after reading the interviews that Williams
gave to psychiatrists, the FBI profilers and probation officers, he
still does not understand why Williams committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "In all likelihood, it is a question the defendant will be
struggling with daily to answer for himself," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Williams will be kept in a special section of the state prison at
Tehachapi for convicts under the age of 18. When he turns 18, he will
be transferred to a maximum security prison.</TE>

<HD>Miranda Ruling Backs Police</HD>
<DH>Law: State Supreme Court says an illegally obtained
confession does not necessarily invalidate a later one given
willingly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court made it easier Thursday for police to
obtain confessions from suspects even after they have requested a
lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   Ruling in a San Diego murder case, the state high court decided 5
to 2 that an admission illegally obtained at a police station does
not invalidate a later confession made at a suspect's home.</LD>
<LD>   Justice Marvin R. Baxter, writing for the majority, said
Thursday's holding is limited to situations in which there is no
"ruse, subterfuge, or pretext" by police to deliberately violate a
suspect's right to have a lawyer present during an interrogation.</LD>
<TE>   Two dissenting justices complained the decision gives police
"carte blanche" to obtain confessions without regard to suspects'
rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be naive to assume that law enforcement will not take
advantage of the new evidentiary door the majority's holdings would
helpfully open for them," wrote Justice Ming W. Chin, whose dissent
was signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruled in the case of Charles Edward Storm, who was
sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife in 1996.
During an investigation by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, Storm
agreed to take a polygraph test.</TE>
<TE>   He was advised of his right to legal counsel, to remain silent and
that anything he said would be used against him, and he waived those
rights, according to the opinion.</TE>
<TE>   But when the polygraph operator told him the test showed he was
lying, he said he wanted to consult a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of immediately ending the questioning, the polygraph
operator encouraged Storm to keep talking. Storm then admitted he had
killed his wife and claimed it was an assisted suicide.</TE>
<TE>   But because police failed to end the interrogation when Storm
asked for a lawyer, the confession could not be used in court,
prosecutors advised investigating officers.</TE>
<TE>   Based on that opinion, detectives devised a new strategy: They
decided to release Storm and contact him again later in hopes of
obtaining a legal confession that could be used in court.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, detectives went to Storm's home and told him they
wanted to hear his side of the story. They promised to leave after
the conversation ended and told Storm he could go about his business.</TE>
<TE>   Storm confessed again, and reiterated that he stabbed his wife
because she wanted to die and asked that he help her. The detectives
arrested him the next day.</TE>
<TE>   The judge at Storm's trial ruled his first confession inadmissible
but held that the second confession could be used because it was
given at Storm's home without coercion. An appellate court agreed.</TE>
<TE>   During his trial, Storm testified that he had not killed his wife
in an assisted suicide. Instead, he said, he "snapped" during an
argument when she disparaged his sexual abilities.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter, writing for the majority, observed that the requirement
that suspects be read their constitutional rights applies only to
those who are questioned in "the coercive atmosphere of police
custody."</TE>
<TE>   The court agreed the first confession could not be used as
evidence against Storm, because police should have stopped
questioning him after he asked for a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "But when the police realized their mistake, they released him,
and they contacted him only after a two-day interval during which he
had ample time, opportunity and incentive to consult counsel outside
the coercive atmosphere of custody," Baxter wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The court rejected defense contentions that the first confession
in violation of Miranda tainted the second confession. Storm spoke
"of his own free will" to detectives at his home, Baxter noted.</TE>
<TE>   "The two-day interval between interviews, during which defendant
was free from custody, served to further attenuate any taint," Baxter
wrote. "The statement obtained at defendant's residence was itself
entirely voluntary."</TE>
<TE>   Chief Justice George, in a one-page dissent, said the court is
required to follow the rule established by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1966 that police must advise suspects of their constitutional rights.
That case, familiar to every police officer in America, is known as
the Miranda decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not countenance a ruse whereby Miranda is given
judicial lip service--obeyed in name but not in fact," the chief
justice wrote. "Unfortunately, the court's opinion today will
encourage precisely the sort of subterfuge by some law enforcement
investigators, with the ensuing violation of constitutional rights,
that Miranda sought to end."</TE>
<TE>   Chin, joined by George, said no one welcomes the prospect of
tossing out a murderer's confession.</TE>
<TE>   "Often, and quite possibly in this case, such a confession affords
the primary evidence linking the suspect to his crime," Chin said.
But there are some cases when throwing out a confession becomes "not
only an unwelcome and distasteful option but a constitutional
necessity," Chin wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He said the second confession might have been admissible if made
many days after the first interrogation or if the police had again
advised Storm of his rights.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Holly D. Wilkens, who argued the case for the
prosecution, said she expects the defense to seek U.S. Supreme Court
review.</TE>
<TE>   She also said she does not believe the ruling will encourage
police to illegally obtain confessions in hopes of winning an
admissible confession later.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think there is any incentive to be deliberately
violating people's rights on the off chance you can release them" and
get them to confess again later, she said. "More often than not, you
are never going to receive the same statement again."</TE>
<TE>   But UC Berkeley law professor Charles D. Weisselberg, who wrote a
brief in the case for the state's criminal defense lawyers' bar, said
he fears "law enforcement will use this case aggressively."</TE>
<TE>   "I think this decision will certainly be reported in [police]
training bulletins throughout California," said Weisselberg, who
represented the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice.</TE>
<TE>   He pointed to a Shasta County district attorney's bulletin for
police that came out shortly after the Court of Appeal in San Diego
ruled the second confession Storm gave admissible.</TE>
<TE>   The description of the ruling was titled: "Catch and Release and
Catch 'em Again."</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Suspect Pleads Innocent</HD>
<DH>Courts: Bail is set at $500,000 for woman in Jessica Cortez
case. The girl and her parents thank clinic worker who recognized
her.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN and ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The South Los Angeles woman accused of taking 4-year-old Jessica
Cortez from Echo Park and keeping her for two days was charged
Thursday with kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   Patricia Cornejo, 39, pleaded not guilty in Los Angeles County
Superior Court to one count of felony kidnapping and one count of
felony child stealing.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing a red coat, Cornejo stood behind a glass partition in the
downtown Los Angeles courtroom and entered the plea through her
attorney. If Cornejo is convicted, she could be sent to state prison
for 13 years.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Commissioner Jeffrey M. Harkavy set bail at
$500,000 and directed her to return to court Aug. 27 for a
preliminary hearing. He also ordered her not to have any contact with
Jessica or her family.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica disappeared Sunday about 7:30 p.m. while her parents were
selling tacos at the park. Authorities first thought she might have
drowned and divers scoured Echo Park Lake for her body. Once police
realized she had been kidnapped, they issued an "Amber alert."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica was rescued Tuesday afternoon at St. John's Well Child
Center after clinic employees called police. The employees said they
were immediately suspicious of Cornejo, who brought Jessica to be
treated for a sore throat.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo, described by acquaintances as reclusive, was arrested
Tuesday night. Deputy Public Defender Cedric Payne represented her
during Thursday's arraignment, but did not comment after the short
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Ronald Geltz said that physical and eyewitness
evidence shows that Cornejo kidnapped Jessica and planned to keep her
away from her parents. Prosecutors have not found any connection
between Cornejo and the girl.</TE>
<TE>   "This is alleged as a stranger taking this child with the intent
to keep the child permanently," Geltz said outside court. He declined
to elaborate about possible motives for the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Cornejo told investigators that she saw Jessica in the park and
took her home, police said. Jessica did not appear to have been
physically or sexually harmed, authorities said. Cornejo's two
daughters, ages 4 and 10, were taken into protective custody, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   Geltz said he does not expect anyone else to be charged in the
case.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's parents, Maria Hernandez and Rafael Cortez, did not
attend the hearing. Instead, they spent Thursday afternoon in Culver
City expressing their gratitude to the health clinic employee who
recognized their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez and the receptionist, Denise Leon, met with a hug and a
burst of tears. Leon also hugged Jessica, who stood in front of a
group of photographers, her eyelids fluttering like a camera shutter.
The 4-year-old girl wore a pink T-shirt and denim shorts, with pink
and white Winnie the Pooh tennis shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez, who came to the United States 13 years ago, said he would
probably continue selling tacos at Echo Park. Hernandez, 27, said she
would either stay home or find someone to help her watch her four
children.</TE>
<TE>   "To everyone, a big hug," Cortez, 38, said as Jessica blew a kiss
to the cameras. Cortez said he was changing the name of his taco cart
from "Smoke in Your Eyes" to "Happy Tacos."</TE>

<HD>Two at Medical Clinic Charged After Santa Ana Sting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The operator of a Santa Ana clinic and his assistant were charged
Thursday with practicing medicine without a license following a
months-long investigation into their treatment of patients,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Alonzo E. Lockhart and assistant Noe Alonzo Villalobos are
scheduled to appear at the Central Justice Center in Santa Ana today
to answer felony charges that they operated illegally out of the
Samuel Clinic in the 1300 block of East 1st Street.</LD>
<LD>   "We consider this extremely serious," said Byron Nelson, the
deputy district attorney handling the case.</LD>
<TE>   According to Nelson, the charges stem from a complaint made by a
patient earlier in the year. The state Board of Medical Examiners
conducted a sting operation April 29 during which an investigator
posing as a patient was examined, diagnosed and treated for an
imagined ailment by Villalobos, who does not have a medical license.
Although Lockhart does have a license, Nelson said, he was not
present during the treatment and was charged for allowing it to
happen in his clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "The modus operandi is that [Villalobos] deals with at least 70%
of the patients," Nelson said. "He does the initial review, examines
them, diagnoses them and even treats them. It's a felony because of
the potential danger."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County parks officials Thursday banned open fires at two
regional parks that border wilderness areas because of extreme fire
danger.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of all the wildfires in the state and the fact that it's
one of the driest years, we're doing this as a precaution," said Tim
Miller, county parks superintendent.</LD>
<LD>   The ban applies to O'Neill Regional Park in Trabuco Canyon and
Caspers Wilderness Park near San Juan Capistrano. Both are popular
for day use and camping.</LD>
<TE>   Camp stoves fueled by gas, propane or butane may be used.
Prohibited are any open fires. In the past, a ban has been enforced
during hot weather and Santa Ana wind conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-April, officials throughout much of Southern California
opened fire season a month earlier than usual.</TE>
<TE>   This year, more than 5,000 acres have burned in Orange County,
said an Orange County Fire Authority spokesman.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: (SF) (2 photos) Christopher Sanchez, 7, center,
doesn't care for the odor from the new fox exhibit at the Los Angeles
Zoo. He and his classmates from Wilton Place Elementary School, Jack
Kwon, 7, left, and Favian Barron, 6, took a field trip there
Thursday. The semicircular exhibit features three different species,
including the Channel Island fox, at right. Another Channel Island
fox is also on display, as are a male red fox and a pair of bat-eared
foxes from South Africa. The foxes' new home is divided into three
different sections and includes murals and plants to simulate the
animals' natural habitat. The environs were built with a grant from
the Ahmanson Foundation. The two Channel Island foxes are a breeding
pair that were brought from other zoos around the nation and are part

Thursday. The semicircular exhibit features three different species,
including the Channel Island fox, at right. Another Channel Island
fox is also on display, as are a male red fox and a pair of bat-eared
foxes from South Africa. The foxes' new home is divided into three
different sections and includes murals and plants to simulate the
animals' natural habitat. The environs were built with a grant from
the Ahmanson Foundation. The two Channel Island foxes are a breeding
pair that were brought from other zoos around the nation and are part
of an effort by the National Park Service to rebuild populations of
the fox on the isles off the Ventura County coast.</CP>

<HD>Cathedral to Tap Solar Power for Electricity</HD>
<DH>Energy: The $600,000 unit is among the largest installed in
the DWP's Green L.A. program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sign of religious commitment to the environment, Cardinal Roger
M. Mahony and civic and religious leaders said Thursday that the
soon-to-open Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels will generate 10% to
15% of its electricity with a $600,000 solar panel that will go
online in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   The array of solar photovoltaic cells, which converts sunlight
into electricity, is one of the largest to be installed as part of
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's Green L.A. program.
It also is the first of 16 solar panels to be installed this year at
churches, synagogues, mosques and other religious buildings through
the work of the Los Angeles Interfaith Environmental Council's Green
Sanctuaries program.</LD>
<LD>   The downtown cathedral is to be dedicated Sept. 2.</LD>
<TE>   Its solar panels, which cover 7,000 square feet on the roof of the
cathedral's nearby conference center, will generate 66 kilowatts of
electricity, an amount equivalent to the power used by 66
single-family homes.</TE>
<TE>   Renewable energy is prized because it reduces dependence on
foreign oil, and is relatively "clean" compared to fossil fuels like
natural gas, coal and oil, which produce pollutants that contribute
to smog and to climate change.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the cathedral plaza and speaking through a microphone
powered by solar energy, Mahony said there are religious as well as
scientific reasons to safeguard the environment.</TE>
<TE>   "In our tradition, our Christian tradition, we believe that human
beings are stewards of all of God's creation," Mahony said. "How we
care for God's creation and environment are very important to us."</TE>
<TE>   He said the same sunlight that streams into the cathedral as a
"beautiful sign and symbol of the transcendent" can also be used to
produce clean energy.</TE>
<TE>   An interfaith theme was underscored by Lee H. Wallach, co-chairman
of the Los Angeles Interfaith Environmental Council. In the Midrash,
rabbinical commentaries on the Scriptures, it says, " 'Do not corrupt
or desolate my world, for if you do, there will be no one to repair
it after you.' It says in the Koran, 'Eat, drink, but waste not by
excess, for Allah loves not the wasters,' " Wallach said. He added
that because environmental destruction often takes its toll on the
planet's poorest and most vulnerable citizens, the responsibility of
faith communities to care for creation is magnified.</TE>
<TE>   "Today we are not only sustaining the quality of life and the
environment for our children and grandchildren," Wallach said. "We
are establishing the moral compass for the rest of the country by
setting this extraordinary example of environmental stewardship."</TE>
<TE>   Civic and religious leaders said they hope that as congregants see
what can be done in their own places of worship, they will want to
undertake similar programs in their homes and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   About half the cost of the $600,000 installation was paid for by
the DWP under its "buyback" program to encourage the installation of
clean, renewable energy. Buyback programs also are available for
residential, commercial and industrial customers. For example, a
typical single-family home installation would run about $20,000. The
homeowner's share after the buyback would be about $8,000, with the
DWP paying $12,000. Depending on where the house is and the cost of
electricity over the years, it would take five to 10 years for the
typical residential system to pay for itself, said Angelina Galiteva,
executive director of the Green L.A. program.</TE>
<TE>   Solar panels are warranted for 25 years. But she said panels built
45 to 50 years ago are still working with little degradation. Solar
electricity costs 18 cents to 22 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared to
10 cents for conventional electricity in the DWP service area, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the buyback program, the DWP will either send a rebate check
to homeowners and businesses who install solar energy, or send it to
the installer, thereby reducing the price to the consumer. The DWP
has a toll-free number for those considering green energy: (800)
473-3652.</TE>

<HD>Jury Duty Scofflaws Get Hit in the Pocketbook</HD>
<DH>In a new crackdown, L.A. County residents who don't show up
for their service are being fined $1,500.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David A. Harper had successfully avoided jury duty for years.</LD>
<LD>   Like so many others, he had repeatedly ignored the pink jury
summonses that had arrived in his mailbox--and nothing had happened.</LD>
<LD>   Then he received a different kind of notice, one that he didn't
think he should dismiss so quickly. Harper, 34, was ordered to appear
at the San Fernando Courthouse or be fined $1,500.</LD>
<TE>   "For many, many years it hasn't been a problem," said the Van Nuys
small-business man. "This time it looked like I needed to do
something.'</TE>
<TE>   Harper is one of thousands of Los Angeles County residents being
threatened with big fines for failing to report for jury duty. The
crackdown is part of a countywide effort to triple the number of
potential jurors under the new one-trial system, under which most
jurors spend significantly less time at the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, jurors who aren't called into a courtroom on
their first day of service are released. Previously, they were
required to serve for two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an awareness campaign," said Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Paul Gutman, who ordered nearly 200 people to pay the
maximum $1,500 fine last month when they failed to show up in his Van
Nuys courtroom to explain why they had missed jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not punishment," he said. "It's not revenue collection."</TE>
<TE>   At the San Fernando Courthouse, Superior Court Judge William A.
MacLaughlin told prospective jurors recently: "We would rather have
you appear as a juror than impose a monetary sanction."</TE>
<TE>   Jurors are mailed two notices before they are sent certified
letters advising them to complete their juror service by a certain
date or explain their absences to a judge, court officials say. If
they do neither, the letter warns they could be fined $1,500 and
still be required to fulfill their jury service.</TE>
<TE>   The court turns the outstanding fines over to a collection agency.
The money goes into the county's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly many people, like Sara Dunbar, 24, of South Pasadena,
don't respond to the final notice and have been fined.</TE>
<TE>   The stunned UCLA student rushed to Gutman's courtroom a week after
receiving a letter from the court stating that she had been assessed
the maximum amount. "I thought, 'This is a mistake,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   But a jury official testified that Dunbar, like thousands of other
prospective jurors, had been sent three notices, including a
certified letter, and that she had not responded until she learned
the fine had been imposed.</TE>
<TE>   Dunbar said she hadn't received earlier notices sent to her
parents' home. "I don't live at that address anymore," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Gutman suspended the fine on the condition that Dunbar complete
her jury service within a month. If not, he warned, the geology major
would have to pay the $1,500--and still do jury duty.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials are now mailing 10,000 sanction notices each
month, up from 2,000 to 3,000 a month, said Gloria Gomez, who
administers the court's jury services.</TE>
<TE>   The court targets a different geographic area each month, she
said, and then holds sanction hearings in that community.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez said she does not know how many people have been fined or
how much money has been collected, but she offered a sampling of
statistics for one Superior Court district.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 10,000 recalcitrant residents mailed jury notice warnings
in and around Pasadena, Gomez said, 712 were fined $1,500 for failing
to respond. Another 626 ended up serving jury duty, she said.</TE>
<TE>   While that may seem like a small percentage, she said many of
those who are mailed notices have moved away or do not qualify for
jury service. The names of recipients are drawn from voter
registration and Department of Motor Vehicle lists. Under state law,
jurors must be, among other things, U.S. citizens, at least 18 years
old and proficient in English.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Jacqueline A. Connor, who heads the court's
trial jury committee, believes the effort is working. About 85% of
the jurors in Santa Monica now tell court officials that this is
their first jury experience, she said, compared with about 15% in
past years.</TE>
<TE>   Juries once were largely made up of retirees and government
employees who had unlimited paid time off for jury duty, Gutman said.
Now they represent a broader cross-section of the population,
including judges, lawyers and other public safety officials.</TE>
<TE>   Court officials say they also are trying to improve the juror
experience. They recently spent $2 million to refurbish the jury
assembly room in Santa Monica, set new guidelines for how long jurors
may be left idling in courthouse corridors, and fully implemented the
one-trial jury system.</TE>
<TE>   The higher turnover has forced court officials to summon more
jurors and get tough with those who try to wiggle out of service.</TE>
<TE>   The court expects to mail 4.5 million jury summonses in Los
Angeles County this fiscal year. In June, it was MacLaughlin's turn
to preside over the sanctions hearings. He ordered a woman who said
she had missed her last court date because she had a kidney
transplant to report to the jury assembly room when she felt better.</TE>
<TE>   A frustrated Ron Coleman of West Hills threatened in a letter to
the court to wheel his 91-year-old mother-in-law, who suffers from
Parkinson's disease and dementia, into Gutman's courtroom for a
sanctions hearing.</TE>
<TE>   He said he was having trouble getting her permanently excused from
jury duty and didn't want her to be fined for not responding to the
court's letter.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't seem to get through the bureaucracy," Coleman
explained. "I couldn't find the right person to talk to."</TE>
<TE>   He finally resolved the matter by writing a letter to Gutman.
Coleman said he, not only got results, but also an apology from the
court.</TE>
<TE>   Michael O'Brien also was angry when he learned he would have to
appear before MacLaughlin in June to avoid being fined for missing
jury duty. The single dad said he did not have anyone to pick up his
two young daughters from school each afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   When the judge gave him no choice, O'Brien, 36, at first was
defiant. He reported to the San Fernando courthouse with his children
in tow. MacLaughlin ordered him to return another day--alone.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his early disdain for the process, O'Brien, a first-time
juror, said he was enlightened by his experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I always circle-filed those summonses," said O'Brien, who
operates a voice and data outlets business from his Valencia home.
"Now I tell people that it isn't as bad as it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   He said he plans to show up for jury duty next time--without a
judge's order to do so.</TE>

<HD>Lobster Catch Lands 2 Men in Hot Water</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials say undersized crustaceans were snatched
from stolen traps in sanctuary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities are looking for a Navy enlisted man and another man who
they say used a military boat to set stolen traps to catch undersized
lobsters in a federal marine sanctuary near San Clemente Island.</LD>
<LD>   The men allegedly chopped up garibaldi, a protected species and
the official state marine fish, and used the pieces as bait.</LD>
<LD>   The men also allegedly ripped the tails off as many as 70 live
lobsters caught near the island in order to freeze the tails for
later use.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said that, because the men had kept only the tails, it
was difficult to determine the actual size of some of the lobsters.</TE>
<TE>   The men were initially taken into custody by members of the Navy
Shore Patrol, who spotted them through binoculars in an area used by
the Navy's elite unconventional warfare unit, the SEALS.</TE>
<TE>   The case has been brewing for about two years, but bench warrants
have just been issued for the arrests of Michael Lee Brydge and
Timothy Norris, both of whom were Navy petty officers in late 2000,
when the incidents allegedly occurred.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, according to their defense attorney, the men were
"engaged in underwater work at a secret level requiring frequent and
unpredictable travel around the world."</TE>
<TE>   Brydge is still an active Navy petty officer, said San Diego
attorney William McGuigan, who is representing both men in the
matter. Norris was a chief petty officer when he resigned from the
military less than a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher
Frisco was weighing strategies for resolving the case, which has
languished in legal delays related to national security concerns and
the ongoing war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't your standard garden-variety criminal case here,"
Frisco said. "We're dealing with two Navy men who apparently felt
they were above the law and free to use stolen traps to plunder the
treasures of the sea."</TE>
<TE>   McGuigan disagreed, up to a point.</TE>
<TE>   To hear him tell it, the men were working in a restricted military
area when they came upon some lobster traps at the island 70 miles
northwest of San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Following proper Navy procedures, the men pulled the traps out of
the water with plans to warn the owners that the area was off-limits
to commercial fishing.</TE>
<TE>   McGuigan does not deny, however, that they then broke the law by
stealing the lobsters inside those traps.</TE>
<TE>   In pretrial meetings, McGuigan said his clients had offered to
settle the case by pleading guilty to having taken the lobsters and
using garibaldi as bait.</TE>
<TE>   "But my clients did not receive stolen property of any kind,"
McGuigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Frisco turned them down.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a case of mere theft," Frisco said. "Stealing a
commercial fisherman's lobster traps is larceny of a man's
livelihood."</TE>
<TE>   The case was initially scheduled to go to trial in September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "But the defense attorney got it continued on grounds the men had
to fight for their country," Frisco said. "Then trial was set for
last April. But their attorney said one of the defendants had severed
his Achilles [tendon] and needed three months to recover."</TE>
<TE>   If and when the case returns to court, the men are facing
misdemeanor charges, including possession of protected fish, trapping
lobsters without an appropriate license, receiving stolen property,
possession of marine game whose size could not be determined and
possession of undersized lobsters.</TE>
<TE>   "They are facing a severe fine," Frisco said. "And if they are
convicted, I'll also be seeking jail time."</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Stutz, spokesman for the Navy Region Southwest, which is
in charge of the Naval Auxiliary Landing Field at the 36,200-acre San
Clemente Island, said the case was not unique.</TE>
<TE>   Last December, he said, two civilians working for the Navy were
accused of stealing "an unspecified number of lobster" from legal
commercial traps set near the island.</TE>

<CX>   Lobsters--A California section story Aug. 16 about two men accused of
catching undersized lobsters off San Clemente Island incorrectly
described comments by the attorney representing the suspects, Michael
Lee Brydge and Timothy Norris. Attorney William McGuigan did not say
his clients stole lobsters. He said the men were willing to plead
guilty to taking too many of them. Also, the cove where the incident
occurred is a restricted military zone, but not, as the story stated,
a federal marine sanctuary.</CX>

<LD>When word spread through the cellblock, Gloria Killian's fellow
inmates ignored the dinner bell and gathered around for a tearful
goodbye. Killian then pushed through a door and returned to a world
she'd been snatched from 16 years ago. As she emerged on the other
side, a cheer went up from inmates who pressed against a chain-link
fence at the state prison for women in Chino.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't even talk about it, it was so powerful and poignant,"
says Killian, whose murder conviction was overturned in March because
the star witness admitted to lying about her involvement. Her release
papers finally came through Aug. 8.</LD>
<LD>   Killian, 56, is a former Sacramento law student who served as
jailhouse attorney and tried to win freedom for fellow inmates even
as her own pleas were rejected. Her driver, as she left Chino, was
the 78-year-old woman who fought for eight years to get her out.</LD>
<TE>   To celebrate, they went to an Italian restaurant in Duarte, where
Killian had scampi over linguine and a glass of wine--a meal that
never made the prison menu. And then Joyce Ride, who began visiting
Killian in 1994, took her home to Pasadena. Killian will board with
her until she can get going on her own.</TE>
<TE>   Killian's first impressions of the free world are that tomatoes
cost too much ("a dollar, for just two?"), that Trader Joe's is
heaven and that a manicure is an underrated luxury.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't sleep the first night. It was too quiet, the bed was
too big, it was too comfortable, it was too soft. I'm not used to
comfort."</TE>
<TE>   Ride leaves the room for a moment during my visit, and Killian
says:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand how she could have been so motivated to get me
out. What a magnificent human being, that she would devote so much
time and resources to this."</TE>
<TE>   Ride, who began visiting women behind bars 25 years ago after
being inspired by a nun who visited her Presbyterian church, returns
to the room with her dog Cady and says:</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a good judge of character."</TE>
<TE>   After a year of almost weekly visits to Killian, Ride became
convinced of her innocence. Ride, a widow, dipped into her retirement
fund to hire the investigator and attorney who helped get her new
friend sprung.</TE>
<TE>   But Killian, who was serving 32 years to life for felony murder,
robbery and conspiracy, is not yet in the clear.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which threw out her
conviction and ordered her released on bail, ruled that she deserves
a new trial. The California attorney general's office has not decided
whether to appeal that ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the
Sacramento district attorney's office is waiting on the decision
before deciding whether to try Killian again.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there's a problem with the bail. Ride offered her house
as collateral for the $200,000 payment. But the home is owned by
Ride's daughter Sally, the first female astronaut, who has the house
tied up in the financing of a real estate transaction.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Ride has been on the phone, trying to work out a solution.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got an Aug. 21 deadline," says Killian, who fears being
hauled back to prison before she gets used to the leafy comfort of a
Pasadena summer. "And they told me in court that they'd come looking
for me."</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that someone whose conviction is dumped, after 16
years of hard time, ought to catch a break on bail. Particularly when
the chief witness against her is a killer who admits that he "lied
his ass off" about Killian's involvement in the 1981 murder to cut a
leniency deal for himself. That witness had earlier called Killian
the mastermind behind the robbery of gold and silver from an elderly
Sacramento couple who were shot, one of them fatally.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the killer's retraction, Kit Cleland, who prosecuted
Killian in 1986 and still works for the Sacramento D.A., insists
she's guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very clear that she was involved in this. There's absolutely
no doubt in my mind," says Cleland. "That's why I say this is a
miscarriage of justice by a heavy-handed appellate court. Prison is
where she belongs, but whether she gets there remains to be seen."</TE>
<TE>   Fire rises in Killian's eyes as I read Cleland's comments to her,
and she literally comes up out of her seat.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot I would love to say," she says, but her attorney
has advised against it until the case plays out.</TE>
<TE>   She's completely innocent, Killian finally tells me, unable to sit
here--free for the first time in 16 years--and not utter a word in
her own defense.</TE>
<TE>   She was working for a private investigations outfit to pay for law
school back in 1981, she says, and because she knew a few people
peripherally connected to the crime, she was a convenient fall girl
for one of the two murderers.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Genego, Killian's attorney, says one murderer fingered Gloria
to protect his wife's involvement and to buy a break on his own
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Genego says the other murderer testified that he had never heard
of Gloria Killian.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Ride, for one, has no doubt about the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Gloria almost as well as I know my own two daughters," she
says. "She's a model of integrity."</TE>
<TE>   Working as lead law clerk in prison, Killian helped research and
draft appeals of fellow inmates, took on guards for inmate abuse and
fought for better medical conditions. She became passionate about
defending battered and abused women, and wants to finish law school
to continue that work professionally.</TE>
<TE>   Next Tuesday, a day before she could be locked up again if bail
isn't posted, she'll be at a "shame on Gray Davis" rally in downtown
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Killian can't wait to stand outside the state building on Spring
Street and blast the policy-by-polling California governor for
refusing to parole women serving long sentences for murdering the men
who tormented them.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many women who've been in prison for 20 years and
longer on a seven-to-life sentence," she bristles.</TE>
<TE>   I ask Killian how she deals with the idea of her own lost time.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to look at it is: Although I lost so much that's
irreplaceable, I've been given irreplaceable gifts too, and the
relationships I made have deeper meaning to me than anything in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   In prison, she showed up at her law clerking job every morning.
For better or worse, she says, it was the career she'd always wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe it was my mission to do this kind of work. I've done it
the last 16 years, and I plan to do it the next 16. There's nothing
anyone could do to make up for the things I lost, and there's nothing
anyone could say to make a difference. But I can drown in misery the
rest of my life, or I can do something positive too."</TE>

<HD>LAPD Could Lose Transit Patrol Job</HD>
<DH>Policing: MTA will consider handing the entire contract
over to Sheriff's Department.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transit officials next month will consider stripping a roughly
$30-million contract from the Los Angeles Police Department and
handing it off to the Sheriff's Department, which is aggressively
pushing to take over policing of trains and buses countywide.</LD>
<LD>   Such a move, to be considered in contract discussions beginning in
September, would dramatically increase the presence of sheriff's
deputies throughout Los Angeles while punching a hole in the city's
fragile budget. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's contract
for the LAPD's transit police has added more than $100 million to
city coffers since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   For the last five years, after the MTA closed most of its in-house
security force, the LAPD and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department have divvied up a roughly $52-million contract to police
the transit agency's vast network.</LD>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department transit unit polices county buses and the
Green and Blue Line railways. An LAPD division patrols the Red Line
subway and city buses. Police are responsible for everything from
stopping pickpockets and muggers to checking to see that passengers
have paid their fares.</TE>
<TE>   Policing the system is complicated by the fact that buses and
trains often course through several cities and jurisdictions. The
sheriff-patrolled Blue Line, for example, starts in Long Beach, cuts
through Compton and ends up in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has worked to keep crime levels low, the MTA's
security arrangement is unusual in the world of big-city transit.
Still, the MTA is angling for major changes, and recently spelled out
a new security policy that will shape the coming contract, likely to
cover another five years.</TE>
<TE>   The policy increases the agency's authority over police, calls for
more community policing and strips fare-checking responsibilities
from officers, all while seeking to reduce security expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A high-ranking MTA official characterized the LAPD as being
difficult to deal with during much of the past year, when the new
policy was created with police input. The official said that if the
LAPD does not fully embrace the MTA's new security policy and come up
with a plan to cut its costs, "they are going to lose out. The LAPD
could end up with nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The perception of the LAPD as grudgingly going along with the
MTA's wishes is seen as contrasting with the attitude of the
Sheriff's Department, which eagerly signed off on virtually all of
the policy changes while saying it will offer a proposal next month
that could shave $6 million from security costs.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and MTA Board Chairman and City
Councilman Hal Bernson are scrambling to ensure that the LAPD keeps
its transit unit.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, also an MTA board member, believes that for the best MTA
security, the LAPD should handle patrols within the city limits. He
worries that sheriff's deputies responding to an emergency within
city limits might have difficulty communicating with street-level
LAPD units, which would be needed for backup.</TE>
<TE>   The contract negotiations promise to be a political test for Hahn,
who has significant clout on the 13-member panel because he appoints
three other members and leads what is usually a unanimous bloc of
votes. After losing out on nearly every major issue he has backed
since joining the MTA last year, the mayor will need to persuade
several other MTA board members to side with him or risk seeing
scores of brown-uniformed sheriff's deputies fan out daily across Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in July, Bernson convened a closed-door meeting with
interim LAPD Chief Martin Pomeroy and Sheriff Lee Baca. Bernson said
Baca agreed not to bid on LAPD territory.</TE>
<TE>   Baca later did an about-face when pressured by County Supervisor
Zev Yaroslavsky, also an MTA board member, sources said. Baca has
been on vacation and unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department's bid is motivated in part by the chance
to bring in more money. Gaining the contract, expected to run at
least $60 million because it would also include policing the Pasadena
Gold Line railway that opens next summer, could come close to
tripling the roughly $22-million annual payment the department now
receives from the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles, losing the contract, which provides $30 million
for the city's general fund, would be a drag on the $4.8-billion city
budget, according to Hahn. The mayor, however, could not provide
specifics when asked which city programs might be affected.</TE>
<TE>   Provided the LAPD found the money to keep the affected officers on
board, a virtual certainty, shedding the transit unit could allow
about 200 officers to join normal LAPD patrols.</TE>
<TE>   But for the Police Department--already reeling after a fight over
the ouster of Chief Bernard C. Parks and fiercely protective of its
turf--seeing sheriff's deputies boarding buses through the city,
walking through the Red Line and patrolling the light railway from
Pasadena to downtown Los Angeles would be a bitter pill.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be unprecedented in the city of Los Angeles," said USC
professor Erwin Chemerinsky, a legal scholar and police expert,
speaking of the possibility of sheriff's deputies roaming LAPD turf.
Chemerinsky speculated that though some officers might see losing the
transit division as a good thing, freeing up scores of officers for
regular duty, others may regard it as a "real slap."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Chemerinsky said, "it could lead to many more
tensions between the two departments." City Hall and LAPD officials
acknowledge that if the MTA board were polled on the matter now, the
Sheriff's Department would likely win out.</TE>
<TE>   The five county supervisors, who oversee the Sheriff's Department
and Baca, sit on the MTA board and are likely to side with their own
agency. It is widely regarded that the only bloc firmly backing the
LAPD would be the mayor and his three appointees. Right now, "We
don't have the votes," said Cmdr. Robert Hansohn, head of the LAPD's
transit division.</TE>
<TE>   Hansohn, who plans to hire an outside negotiator to help him in
the talks, said that his agency is eager to keep the contract and
more willing than ever to back the MTA proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he is worried that cutting costs could lead to an
increase in crime. "It's hard to believe the system is going to be
safer" under an MTA plan that could lead to fewer officers and use of
civilian fare checkers, Hansohn said.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky disagrees. He said he believes the MTA could be better
served by having a single law enforcement agency and that competition
for the contract will serve to drive costs down for the transit
agency.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the best proposal win. That's best for the MTA," Yaroslavsky
said. "City Hall is desperate to protect its turf and the LAPD. But
if they want to keep the contract, they are going to have to make a
more competitive proposal."</TE>

<HD>Growing Up With a Coroner's Knock</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not always easy to pinpoint the moment we become adults, when we
change from seeing the world through one set of eyes to another.</LD>
<LD>   For John Ha, it came Sunday night when a coroner's deputy knocked
on his door about 11 p.m. In the next minute, he told John that his
parents, Can and Bichha, had been killed in a traffic accident. He
handed John a necklace his father wore, plus his wallet and watch.</LD>
<LD>   Before the knock on the door, John Ha was an 18-year-old kid. By
the time the conversation ended, he was an 18-year-old man, suddenly
orphaned with a younger brother to take care of.</LD>
<TE>   It is a duty John promises to fulfill. He says he plans to become
his brother's legal guardian.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something I can do, and believe I have the ability to
withstand the situation," he says Thursday in his Tustin living room.
"When I think about it, I'm an adult now. I have to raise my little
brother. It's a big responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   His brother is 16-year-old Andrew, a junior at Tustin High School
and, by John's accounting, a better and more committed student than
he was. Andrew was president of his eighth-grade class at C.E. Utt
Middle School and treasurer of his sophomore class at Tustin High.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always dedicated to the school," John says. "The meetings
nobody else goes to, he goes to."</TE>
<TE>   John's parents were killed Sunday evening when their brown Toyota
compact was broadsided by a Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle in a
Santa Ana intersection. A witness told police the Toyota stopped
before entering the intersection, then pulled into the path of the
oncoming vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, we're talking in the midst of a house
cluttered with items he is sifting through, either to give away or
make available at a garage sale. John apologizes for the mess and
says his massive cleanup serves both to tidy up the home and distract
him.</TE>
<TE>   "It just keeps me from thinking. If I work, it keeps my mind off
the accident. If I take a break, then I think about it again, so I
might as well just work."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew returns today from a two-day student-government retreat in
Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted him to go," John says, "to get his mind off of things.
He's taking it hard. The first day ... he was on the floor, he
couldn't get up. Same with me. But I was strong that day. On Tuesday,
my brother started crying all night. I couldn't calm him down, stop
him from crying. He took it pretty hard. He still is."</TE>
<TE>   I ask John if he thinks he's seeing things clearly, if he's aware
of the responsibilities he's decided to inherit at such a young age.
He jokes that people at DMV told him he looked 15, not 18, when he
went to get a driver's license.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a lot of support that will help me out," he says. "I know
it will get me through this. But for my brother, I'm not so sure.
Even though he says he's strong--and I believe that--deep down, he
still feels it really hard."</TE>
<TE>   An aunt is staying with the boys for now, but she and the other
closest relatives live either in Canoga Park or San Jose. Some are
helping with the legal and financial matters that must be resolved,
and John is hoping their aunt can stick around for a while. John says
officials at Parker-Hannifin Corp., where his father worked, have
said it will pay funeral expenses.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that he and his brother can remain in the family home.
They won't starve, John jokes. His immediate agenda, he says, is to
stick with plans to enroll at Irvine Valley College, get a job and
make sure Andrew stays on track.</TE>
<TE>   Visitation hours for Can and Bichha Ha have been set for today and
Saturday at the Rose Hills Mortuary in Costa Mesa. Funeral services
are scheduled for 10 a.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   I ask John if, a week ago, he'd have thought of himself as mature.
"Not really, because I always thought my parents would be there for
me the whole time. But now when I think about it, I have to be that
person."</TE>
<TE>   I ask if he's doing it because he thinks his parents would have
expected it.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't expect me to do it," he says. "But I know I have to do
it."</TE>
<TE>   Is he afraid?</TE>
<TE>   "No, because I know my parents are with me in my heart," he says.
"They really have a lot of faith in me. I'm kind of ready to move on
to the next step."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Schools Gear Up for Awaited Building Binge</HD>
<DH>Education: Three years after bond measure passes, district
hires overseeing architect, PR agency. Work will begin at four
elementary sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>School administrators in Santa Ana are ratcheting up construction
efforts with the recent hiring of an architect to oversee the work
and a well-known Latino public relations agency to draw attention to
expansion projects starting at four elementary schools in the
overcrowded district.</LD>
<LD>   Both moves demonstrate how Santa Ana Unified School District is
preparing to spend $145 million in bond funds approved by city voters
as Measure C in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   To raise awareness of the plans, district officials held a
ceremonial groundbreaking Thursday at George Washington Elementary
School, where a $7.3-million expansion will add 33 classrooms,
teacher work areas and restrooms as well as reopen vital playground
space now jammed with 26 portable classrooms.</LD>
<TE>   On hand to celebrate were three school board members, the
district's superintendent and the guest of honor, Kenneth Mitchell,
92, the first principal of the 52-year-old school, which originally
was built for 600 students. The work is expected to be finished by
winter 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "The citizens of Santa Ana took an important first step to meet
the unique challenges of Santa Ana Unified by approving Measure C to
modernize existing schools," Supt. Al Mijares told the parents,
children, teachers and others assembled on the campus grounds in
southwest Santa Ana. "Today, that vote in favor of the bond directly
benefits the 1,400 students of Washington Elementary School."</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena-based Valencia, Perez and Echeveste is being paid $25,000
to publicize Thursday's event and groundbreaking ceremonies for three
other elementary schools this month and next. District officials said
the public relations firm also will send fliers to area residents to
alert them to the work planned in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to get the word out about what the district is doing,
particularly in the Spanish media," company partner Manuel Valencia
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said his company has done work for Los Angeles Unified School
District, the cities of Los Angeles, Pasadena and Azusa, and
corporate clients including McDonald's, Mervyns, AT&amp;T and Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   The district also has hired architect Bill Sharp to the new
position of chief facilities officer. Sharp, who has helped build
schools in several school districts in Southern California, will earn
about $150,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp, 63, of Laguna Beach, said that even though the district
already has hired Del Terra Construction to oversee the building, his
position is vital for the district because "the buck will stop with
me."</TE>
<TE>   Sharp said he will oversee construction of two-story wings at
Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Jackson
elementary schools, as well as monitor projects elsewhere in the
district.</TE>
<TE>   Mijares said Sharp's title is new, but he essentially is filling
the job of assistant superintendent of facilities, which has been
vacant for two years.</TE>
<TE>   District spokeswoman Lucy Araujo-Cook said the moves are aimed at
gearing up for major construction projects outlined in Measure C.
"It's a lot for us to watch at one time," she said.</TE>

<HD>Secession Is a Divisive Issue for Democrats</HD>
<DH>Politics: County party disagrees with its Valley clubs and
plans to interview candidates in the breakaway areas for possible
endorsements.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breaking from colleagues in the San Fernando Valley, the Los Angeles
County Democratic Party has voted to interview candidates for office
in a proposed Valley city and to consider them for endorsements.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic Party of the San Fernando Valley, an umbrella group
for 16 Democratic clubs, voted previously not to endorse or even
interview candidates, saying that would be inconsistent with its
opposition to secession.</LD>
<LD>   County party Chairman Eric Bauman, however, said he does not see a
conflict between interviewing candidates for city council in the
proposed Hollywood and Valley cities and the county party's
opposition to secession.</LD>
<TE>   "The worst thing that can happen to Democrats is to turn the San
Fernando Valley lock, stock and barrel over to the Republicans,"
Bauman said. "We may not endorse, but interviewing the candidates
will allow us to endorse if we decide to."</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic Party debate highlights the conflicts that
secession has imposed on Los Angeles politics and politicians.
Organized labor and many of the area's elected leaders have announced
their opposition to the city breakup proposals, but some also are
wary of alienating the significant portion of the San Fernando Valley
that favors creating its own city.</TE>
<TE>   Within the Democratic Party, the split grows out of the
relationship between the county group and its Valley counterpart.
Bauman said the Valley party is chartered by the county party as a
group of volunteer Democratic clubs, but only the county party
positions are the official positions of the Democratic Party. As a
result, the Valley and county organizations can adopt different
approaches, but only the county's position represents a party
standard.</TE>
<TE>   The county Republican Party has not announced a position on
secession.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Daar, a leader of the Valley party, recently discouraged
Democrats from running for office in the Valley city. That infuriated
Democratic leaders within the secession movement, who on Thursday
held a protest outside what they thought were the county party
offices. The building they protested in front of has an auditorium
sometimes used by the county party, but its headquarters are
elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Daar's comments, the protesters said, were undemocratic, and they
wrote state and national party leaders to ask them to suspend Daar
from his leadership position and investigate his actions.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeffrey Daar has gone too far," said Gene La Pietra, president of
the Hollywood Independence Committee. "He has tried to hijack the
party and remove it from being the party of inclusion to being the
party of exclusion."</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists said top Democratic allies in the labor movement
have gone even further.</TE>
<TE>   Sid Gold, a Democratic candidate for Valley city council, said he
was approached by a union leader and warned that any Democrat who
runs for office in the proposed cities will lose labor support for
life.</TE>
<TE>   Daar was unavailable for comment, but Moreen Blum, a member of the
Valley Democrats' executive committee, said she stands by his
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we endorse or urge people to run for an office that we
don't think should exist?" Blum asked.</TE>
<TE>   Although the city races are nonpartisan, Mel Wilson and Benny
Bernal, two Democratic candidates for Valley mayor, said they will
seek interviews with the county party because a party endorsement can
help in the Valley, where 51% of voters are Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Valley attorney and secession backer Bob Scott and his
supporters objected Thursday to a decision by Mayor James K. Hahn to
replace him on the city Planning Commission. Scott said he believed
he was removed because of his pro-breakup stand.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, who is the most senior planning commissioner, said the
decision to replace him came after he rebuffed efforts by Hahn
advisors to join the anti-secession effort.</TE>
<TE>   "I was approached a week ago by one of the mayor's top advisors,
and he asked me to go over to their side," Scott said, adding that
they implied "you are either part of our team or not."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Hahn said there was no correlation between
Scott's replacement and his position on secession.</TE>

<DH>Health: Rocketdyne officials insist that only safe
materials from the lab near Simi Valley were sent to two L.A. County
landfills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radioactive material from Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory
near Simi Valley has been dumped in two Los Angeles County landfills
that lack appropriate safeguards, U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But Rocketdyne officials flatly reject those assertions, saying
the company has never dumped radioactive waste in local landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The California Democrat said radioactive material from the hilltop
lab has been shipped to the Calabasas Landfill and the Sunshine
Canyon Landfill in Granada Hills as part of an ongoing federal
cleanup effort.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Energy has acknowledged that waste with a level
of radioactivity deemed safe for general disposal was sent to the
Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley, Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   "These landfills, often situated near neighborhoods and without
sophisticated monitoring systems, are not suitable for disposal sites
for radioactive materials," Boxer said. "Radioactive waste collected
from highly contaminated sites must not be handled like the trash
collected from our kitchens."</TE>
<TE>   The senator said she learned radioactive waste had been dumped in
Calabasas and Granada Hills from Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham
in his response to her letter requesting information on Rocketdyne's
radioactive waste-disposal process.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, dated June 28, Abraham said soil and debris from
the Rocketdyne lab are shipped off site for disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Radioactive materials with levels above federal and state safety
standards are shipped to facilities in Utah, Nevada or Washington,
the letter stated.</TE>
<TE>   If the material's level of radioactivity is below federal and
state standards it is disposed of in local sanitary or hazardous
waste landfills, according to Abraham's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Soil and debris, as well as trash from the lab's office areas,
have been shipped to the Bradley, Calabasas and Sunshine landfills,
Abraham said, adding, "The level of radioactivity is so low, the
equivalent of about two chest X-rays, that disposal in these types of
landfills is protective of public health and the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Boxer maintains any level of radiation is too much, spokesman
David Sandretti said. "Radioactive waste should be disposed of in a
proper setting, and a local landfill is not a proper setting," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials don't dispute that the waste went to the
landfills, but they say it was not radioactive or dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "Any cleanup at the site has met all release criteria; only normal
trash from office areas has been sent to the three landfills," said
Steve Lafflam, Rocketdyne's division director for safety, health and
environmental affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Lafflam said the aerospace giant takes public health issues
seriously and would not do anything to violate its trust with the
community, but that "a few individuals with a broader agenda want to
use Santa Susana as a pivot point for a national debate" on
environmental regulatory issues.</TE>

<HD>To Attack Hunger, Attack Poverty</HD>
<DH>The poor starve in a world with abundant food.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLARD W. COCHRANE</AU>
<BD>Willard W. Cochrane, a professor emeritus at the
University of Minnesota, was chief agricultural economist in the
Kennedy administration. He is the subject of the book "Willard
Cochrane and the American Family Farm" (University of Nebraska Press,
2000).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a dream world, each country produces according to its comparative
advantage, trades on a level global playing field and has enough
money to buy the surplus products of its trading partners if it needs
them. There are no worries about product gluts, low prices or
environmental degradation. If the problem is starvation in Africa,
the solution is no more complicated than pouring more fertilizer on
crops in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The real world is a very different place. Countries are not the
same, and a failure to understand this obvious condition has
disastrous consequences for developing a global food policy to end
world hunger.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the most developed countries, led by the United States but
also including Japan, Germany and the British Commonwealth nations,
produce more of almost everything than they can consume and must
constantly seek new markets for their surplus products.</LD>
<TE>   Another group of countries, including China, India, Thailand,
Brazil and South Korea, can for the most part feed themselves and are
becoming important exporters of both agricultural and manufactured
products.</TE>
<TE>   In a third group of countries, which covers much of Africa and
such nations as Afghanistan and Myanmar and parts of Latin America
and the East Indies, production is at subsistence or below,
birthrates are high and populations are kept in check by starvation,
disease and civil strife. The natural resources of these countries
are typically exploited in ways that benefit the wealthy around the
world. Meanwhile, the common resident goes hungry and there's no
money to buy foodstuffs from the countries that have surpluses. These
are the people we think about when we hear the phrase "feeding the
world."</TE>
<TE>   As this makes clear, the problem is not a lack of food in the
world. The problem is that poor people do not have enough money to
buy food. As simple as this concept is, it appears to completely
mystify proponents of an all-out industrial agricultural model for
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   I have supported realistic food assistance programs for the poor
and hungry, both here and abroad, for 50 years or more. In doing so,
I have learned two hard lessons. First, if the fertilizer and
chemical companies want to promote more production in surplus
regions, then they, and not the public, should subsidize the
distribution of that surplus food.</TE>
<TE>   Second, even in cases where food aid shipments help the starving
survive, those shipments alone will not produce lasting economic
development. Without that development, the root cause of
hunger--poverty, not global food shortages--persists.</TE>
<TE>   A serious program to address world poverty must involve giving
money, not fertilizer, to established organizations that distribute
food to the world's poor so that these groups can acquire the
necessary food supplies from the world's existing abundance.</TE>
<TE>   We also must support effective family planning in countries where
food shortages are chronic problems. And we must develop and fund
small-scale credit programs targeted on women and small farmers in
poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, instead of plans to relieve world poverty, industrial
agriculture offers us self-serving programs that would pour more
fertilizers and pesticides into crop production in the high-yielding
areas of the developed world. The result is completely predictable:
more production in areas that are already experiencing commodity
gluts and low farm prices.</TE>
<TE>   Programs to alleviate global poverty will best address food
shortages in the developing world. Programs to make agriculture more
sustainable will, in the long run, prevent resource degradation that
threatens more widespread food shortages.</TE>

<HD>Waco 2: Can I Get an Amen?</HD>
<DH>Inbred and out of touch: Call them the Brunch Bushians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the behest of their charismatic leader, the cult members gathered
in Waco, a hot, dusty town on the flat, featureless central Texas
plain. They had been summoned to hear an endless series of droning
sermons from the leader himself and his fellow fanatics.</LD>
<LD>   Thunderously denouncing all doubters, all those who didn't believe
as the cult members did, the speakers put forward a bizarre religious
vision, one that no sane person could accept. As the hours passed,
the group became more and more isolated from the real world until it
was incapable of dealing with it. The only thing missing was Janet
Reno and her flamethrower. George W. Bush's economic forum ended with
the steady whoosh of departing corporate jets instead of a fiery
apocalypse. This time the conflagration wasn't in Waco but on Wall
Street, where one airline declared bankruptcy, another threatened to
if it didn't get what it wanted and a third announced a massive
restructuring with 7,000 lost jobs.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
declined to embarrass his boss by lowering interest rates, although
the Fed did assess the current economic outlook in unusually gloomy
terms.</LD>
<TE>   But none of these inconvenient facts intruded on the president's
revival meeting in the Lone Star State, where discouraging words from
nonbelievers were kept to the barest minimum. And while the president
may have acknowledged that our economy is "challenged"--an
understatement akin to saying that David Koresh was "a tad
kooky"--the hallelujah chorus that was determined to drown out facts
with blind faith clearly won the day.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Branch Davidians, the Brunch Bushians found comfort by
withdrawing from a world that was confusing, complicated and just a
little too unfriendly of late. Appropriately convened at the
traditional venue of old-time Christian religion--Baylor
University--the administration orchestrated a full-blown extravaganza
complete with stirring words, a parade of icons and even marching
music by John Philip Sousa, designed to dazzle the gullible and win
new converts.</TE>
<TE>   Reason was banished. No one mentioned, for example, the expanding
budget deficit or the exploding trade deficit, and no one dared bring
up the heresy of reconsidering the Brunch Bushians' disastrous tax
cut. Au contraire.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard a lot of really challenging ideas today," Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill intoned after the forum. And his idea of a
challenging idea? "We had several people in my session tell us that
not only should we make the tax cuts permanent, but we ought to
accelerate the ones that are delayed."</TE>
<TE>   And there was no need to pass the hat at this gathering of the
faithful. The CEO congregants crowding the front pews had already
given, and given, and given.</TE>
<TE>   The economic forum gained added significance from the fact that
the president took precious time away from his monthlong
vacation--though it's not as though he had to travel very far. No,
this time the mountain of true believers came to Muhammad.</TE>
<TE>   The president's production registered his concern (Seven Cabinet
members! Hearing from ordinary people! Taking a whole half-day off
from his vacation! Recovery must be just around the bend!), but the
message that came through was more one of faith--increasingly
desperate faith--that powerful and mysterious forces, the gods of the
free market, will eventually pull the Dow out of its nosedive.</TE>
<TE>   But while the Burning Bush preached to the choir at Baylor, an
ominous rumbling was coming from outside. This time, it was not ATF
sharpshooters and tanks; it was those ordinary citizens the Bushians
pretended to include in Waco.</TE>
<TE>   They keep losing jobs and losing their savings while their
president keeps telling them that despite the increasingly grim
realities of their daily lives, they still gotta believe in the
Bushians' Holy Trinity: more tax cuts, less regulation and more
domestic energy exploration.</TE>
<TE>   Amen, and pass the marshmallows, pardner. I feel a political
firestorm coming on.</TE>

<HD>Valley Runs the Risk of Being Burned by Secession</HD>
<DH>Fire protection would be less effective in a separate city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAT McOSKER</AU>
<BD>Pat McOsker is a Los Angeles Fire Department
firefighter and chairman of the Secession Task Force of the United
Firefighters of Los Angeles City.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are safer if we stick together.</LD>
<LD>   The United Firefighters of Los Angeles City studied the possible
public safety effects of San Fernando Valley secession. We discussed
the issues with hundreds of front-line firefighters and paramedics,
met with command staff chiefs, pored over every available document
relating to secession and studied countless other documents detailing
the L.A. Fire Department's current capabilities and levels of
service. Ultimately, we concluded that dividing Los Angeles could
seriously weaken fire and paramedic protection.</LD>
<LD>   If secession passes, the newly created city would be obliged to
contract with Los Angeles for LAFD protection for one full year.
After that, it would be free to contract with another provider or to
establish a fire department of its own. We believe that the Valley's
"alimony" obligation starting at nearly $128 million per year, a
relatively small budgetary reserve and the likelihood of continued
economic uncertainty would force the Valley to cut costs and reduce
services. If that turns out to be the case, a new city would be
likely to cease contracting with the LAFD for the best available fire
and paramedic protection. We see grave consequences in this for
Valley residents.</LD>
<TE>   We believe that emergency response times will increase if the
Valley is no longer protected by the largest municipal fire
department on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the LAFD's response to the May explosion at the Newcastle
Apartments in Encino. As dozens of nearby fire companies responded,
dispatchers simultaneously "moved up" other LAFD resources. Without
delay, 21 fire companies and four ambulances back-filled depleted
Valley fire stations. In the first hour alone, these temporary
replacements--the "moved-up" companies--responded to 13 emergency
calls in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   A department one-third the size of the Los Angeles Fire Department
could not back-fill on that scale without creating dangerous holes in
coverage elsewhere. Instead, it would be forced to rely on mutual aid
from other jurisdictions. Mutual aid companies must be requested and
then approved by desk-bound administrators, resulting in lost time.</TE>
<TE>   Without LAFD protection, Valley residents should expect a lessened
ability to bolster fire stations with additional personnel in
neighborhoods most at risk from brush fires. Augmenting certain
stations in this way lets firefighters hit small fires with extra
resources, keeping them from becoming larger. A smaller fire
department would have less flexibility to beef up stations in brush
areas without stripping other neighborhoods of protection.</TE>
<TE>   We are also concerned about the future of ambulance service in the
Valley. The LAFD offers the best emergency medical service delivery
system in Los Angeles County. Our ambulances are staffed by highly
trained and dedicated firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Some smaller departments in the county do not have ambulances. In
those neighborhoods, firefighters respond to medical calls in trucks,
while relying on the arrival of private ambulances to transport
patients. A similar system in the Valley would result in delays in
getting patients to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Helicopter operations are also threatened by secession. Our fleet
of six LAFD helicopters is stationed at Van Nuys Airport. In the
event of a split, the Valley city would be entitled to two of the six
helicopters. Undoubtedly, the remaining four would be moved south of
Mulholland Drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Fire Department has determined that two
helicopters could not adequately protect the Valley due to the need
for multiple helicopters on certain operations, and because of
downtime for routine maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   For many months now, Valley residents have been hearing that Los
Angeles doesn't work because it's just too big. The United
Firefighters of Los Angeles City believes otherwise. With regard to
fire and paramedic protection, bigger is better ... and better is
safer.</TE>

<AU>BRUCE WATSON</AU>
<BD>Bruce Watson, a frequent contributor to Smithsonian
magazine, is the author of the forthcoming book "The Man Who Changed
How Boys and Toys Were Made" (Viking-Penguin).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A father writes to Texas Ranger shortstop Alex Rodriguez and New York
Yankee owner George Steinbrenner about the effect of a possible
baseball strike on his son.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I am writing to tell you about my son.</LD>
<TE>   He is 7 1/2, and this summer he became a baseball fan.</TE>
<TE>   Nate made his Pee-Wee League debut this season, got several hits,
even caught a pop fly. He is still talking about that pop fly. But he
is not just a fan of the game. To the amazement of a father who gave
up on baseball three strikes ago, my son has become a major fan of
the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   He has your baseball card, Mr. Rodriguez, along with 40 others.
Every morning, he gets up, puts on his Red Sox cap and begins
fingering through his cards. I have told him about Koufax and Mays
and Babe Ruth, but Nate prefers to talk about players I've never
heard of, the current crop I long ago dismissed as greedheads. He
knows precisely 40 of them by name, team and position, and he has
changed his dream from becoming a rock musician to playing in the
major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   We've been to a few minor league games, but Nate already knows the
difference between the minors and "The Show." He wants more than
anything to go to a big league game. I have better ways to blow
$150--on things like groceries and gas.</TE>
<TE>   I am writing to seek your expertise.</TE>
<TE>   I have taught my son everything I know about baseball. The lessons
started when we lost a few balls in the backyard. I explained what I
learned as a boy--that baseballs don't merely fly into bushes; they
vanish into them. I went on to clarify the force play, bunting, the
sacrifice fly. I even tackled the infield fly rule.</TE>
<TE>   But I haven't figured out how to explain to a gap-toothed,
freckle-faced kid why men who average $2.4 million a year might go on
strike.</TE>
<TE>   At first, I dodged the topic. It never came up when watching games
on TV, so I decided to wait until late August when there might be no
more games. Then, last week, my wife brought it up at dinner, and
suddenly there it was on the table.</TE>
<TE>   First I had to redefine "strike." It wasn't just a 95-mph fastball
that caught the inside corner. It also meant workers refusing to
work. Or play, I guess.</TE>
<TE>   "Refuse to play baseball?" Nate asked. "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, there's a pile of money in baseball, from TV contracts and
$50 tickets. The players and owners can't agree on how to share it."</TE>
<TE>   "They get paid for playing baseball?"</TE>
<TE>   Seeing how far apart we were, I decided to postpone further talks.
But Nate still wants to know why. Why would Mike Piazza, whom he
insists on calling Mike Pizza, refuse to play? Would Joe Nathan
(who?) go on strike?</TE>
<TE>   Will there be baseball next season? Ever again?</TE>
<TE>   Though I tell him baseball is a business, Nate still sees it as a
game, so I'm writing to ask you a favor.</TE>
<TE>   If a strike begins, you won't have much to do for a while. Could
you come to my house and tell my son why players and owners might
choose once again to tarnish the game?</TE>
<TE>   Nate may not want to hear it, but as a father, I'd love to know at
what age a boy in love with the open space of a diamond becomes a man
concerned with "revenue sharing."</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know when you traded your baseball cap, like the one
my son puts on each morning, for talk about "salary caps." And I'm
dying to hear a man who makes $23 million a year explain just how
rich he's entitled to become playing a boy's game, one for which I
would have surrendered my entire card collection, including Mickey
Mantle, to play for a living?</TE>
<TE>   My son already knows that baseball is a game of thorny questions.
"Dad," he asked while playing catch, "if the ball hits first base, is
it fair or foul?"</TE>
<TE>   "Fair," I said, tossing the ball back.</TE>
<TE>   Two throws later: "Dad, what about a fly ball that goes over first
base and lands foul?"</TE>
<TE>   "Foul."</TE>
<TE>   So, Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Steinbrenner, the question is: fair or
foul?</TE>
<TE>   If you could just explain why it's fair for you to play games with
the faith of a young boy, then I might cough up $150 for a game. But
if you can't explain, then the game is even more foul than I
expected. And when my son asks where baseball went, I'll have to tell
him that, like a ball that flew into the bushes, it just vanished.</TE>

<HD>A Handle on Deadly 'Bugs'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bioweapons researcher Steven J. Hatfill is being treated like a
suspect as the FBI very publicly searches his home and hunts for
anthrax connections. The agency has not shown any hard evidence
against Hatfill in connection with last fall's attacks, and the case
has taken on a tinge of persecution.</LD>
<LD>   It's too bad, because the controversy is smothering a broader
issue--the government's need to get a better handle on which U.S.
scientists handle and possess potentially lethal biological and
chemical agents.</LD>
<LD>   Two months ago, President Bush signed regulations requiring
university and other research labs, scientists and drug manufacturers
to tell federal authorities whether they possess any of 36 pathogens,
including anthrax and the Ebola virus, that can be used to make
biological weapons.</LD>
<TE>   The rules also impose tighter controls on who handles potential
bioweapons materials. For particularly deadly bugs, scientists would
have to undergo criminal background checks--hardly a huge burden,
given that even school bus drivers are checked before they're hired.</TE>
<TE>   Some university officials and influential scientists are lobbying
the Bush administration and Congress to water down the rules or at
least postpone their Sept. 10 implementation date.</TE>
<TE>   On one point they are right: Enforcers should carefully balance
national security with the freedoms of medical research.</TE>
<TE>   One rule, for instance, would bar scientists from working with
"potentially dangerous" agents at home. Not all scientists stop
working at 5 p.m., and one man's danger could be another man's
discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Bush officials may also want to reconsider barring people with
drug convictions or a history of mental illness from possessing the
pathogens on the list. Many of history's brilliant scientists have
wrestled with drug use or mental illness. Charles Darwin frequently
talked back to voices in his head. "A Beautiful Mind" mathematician
John Forbes Nash Jr. is schizophrenic.</TE>
<TE>   An equally tough question is cost. For instance, should the
government pay $280,000 a year for cameras and watchers at a biology
lab that is receiving a $48,000 grant?</TE>
<TE>   And what about that list of 36 pathogens? Should the common flu
virus be added, now that a study has shown that it can easily be made
deadly by tweaking its genes?</TE>
<TE>   Even with all the questions, Bush officials should carefully begin
enforcing the rules Sept. 10. These precautions were overdue even
when Congress proposed them in November, and it will take a long time
to get them fully in place.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's obsessive concern with Hatfill may or may not be
justified. But there is no question that the government needs to get
a better idea of where certain pathogens are and who controls them.</TE>

<HD>Power of Symbols in India</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president of India plays a largely ceremonial role, subordinate
to the prime minister, but a smart politician can create power from
symbolism. The new occupant of the office, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,
displayed that skill in picking a state torn by religious rioting for
his first official visit, signaling his concern for the nation's
Muslim minority.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed in riots
in the western state of Gujarat in February and March. The state
government did little to stop days of carnage that began as revenge
after Muslims burned a train carrying Hindus back from a holy site
claimed as sacred by both faiths.</LD>
<LD>   Months after the riots, thousands of Muslims still live in relief
camps. Thousands more are homeless and live with friends or
relatives. Only when Kalam unexpectedly announced his visit did the
state government, controlled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya
Janata Party, finally make a small effort at clearing debris and
whitewashing scorch marks from houses.</LD>
<TE>   Kalam, 71, is the third Muslim to be president of India since the
nation became independent from Britain in 1947. He has no experience
in politics. His main accomplishment is spearheading India's nuclear
missile program.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of parties runs the national government, with the
Bharatiya Janata Party foremost. Their leaders chose Kalam as the
joint candidate of the ruling coalition in an attempt to show respect
for minorities in a nation that prides itself on secularism. The
opposition Congress Party's leader also offered her endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   Kalam, who was installed as president last month, visited the
sites of the worst rioting. He did not stay long in most places, but
he listened, asked questions and showed his concern. Fundamentalist
Hindu groups that were happy to have the national hero known as the
Missile Man as president complained loudly about the itinerary.</TE>
<TE>   In his Independence Day speech Thursday in New Delhi, Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee deplored the "horrific explosion of
communal violence in Gujarat." Indian leaders have seen such violence
too often; they should prosecute those who foment it and those who
carry it out. Removing Gujarat's chief minister, who did little to
stop the killings, would be a good start.</TE>
<TE>   India's Muslims constitute about 14% of the nation's more than 1
billion people. After his visit, Kalam urged an end to religious
clashes and adherence to tolerance. He is well positioned to deliver
that message and should take every advantage of the platform given
him.</TE>

<LD>What are the tobacco barons to do? Cancer and heart disease are
killing off their best customers, every year more people are giving
up cigarettes or, wisely, choosing not to start, and steady tax hikes
are making a pack of smokes more expensive for those still puffing
away. The folks who make cigarettes are getting desperate to hang on
to the dwindling number of customers.</LD>
<LD>   Sex has always worked to sell cigarettes. So enter the Kool
Vending Female, as she's officially known. With her fire-engine-red
lipstick, come-hither voice and brown locks, this virtual vixen purrs
from the video screen of a new generation of cigarette vending
machines. Press the button for Marlboro or Camel cigarettes and the
Kool Vending Female coos, "Lucky Strikes are delicious. Toasted and
delicious, and I'll give you a pack for 75 cents off."</LD>
<LD>   Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco is testing these new machines in
selected cities. Kool Vending Female and her companion, a guy with a
black goatee, accept only credit cards, and through a microprocessor
scan of each customer's driver's license to verify the buyer's age,
they are supposed to prevent sales to underage individuals.</LD>
<TE>   The company of course hopes the machines will boost vending
machine sales. The vending machines record the brands that customers
buy, although Brown &amp; Williamson says it won't keep their names.
Repeat customers will get buy-one-get-one-free deals and other
discounts.</TE>
<TE>   When sex doesn't work, the cigarette makers haven't been shy about
taking a page from Tony Soprano's book. Over the last 20 years,
according to a new study, the tobacco conglomerates pressured some
drug companies, themselves part of giant corporations, to limit their
marketing of nicotine gum and skin patches that help smokers quit.
The Journal of the American Medical Assn., in its current issue,
documents how Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro and Virginia Slims
brands, threatened to end its purchases from Dow Chemical of a
chemical used to moisten tobacco unless Dow's subsidiary at the time,
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, eliminated anti-tobacco statements from
its ads for Nicorette gum.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has hardly renounced that bare-knuckles approach. As
New York City considers a restaurant smoking ban, two restaurant
trade magazines recently accepted ads supporting the move. Editors at
those two magazines soon got e-mail from Philip Morris asking whether
they would run the ads and insinuating that it would base its own
advertising decisions on the answers. The anti-smoking ads were later
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   The more things change, the more they stay the same--including,
apparently, the belief by tobacco executives that the only thing
worse than a dead smoker is an ex-smoker.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Privatize Roads to Ease Clogging," Voices, Aug. 10: We have
already paid for the clogged highways through gas taxes and other
taxes, and now Adam Summers wants us to pay again through toll roads.
I think only one of his ideas, about the gas tax, is good--that way
the ones who use the roads the most will pay the most. As to his
other idea of paying a toll, it will really be nice when only the
rich can visit their relatives on holidays and the rest of us will
have to stay home and enjoy ourselves alone.</LD>
<LD>   There are certain things that the private sector should not
control, and the highways are just one. Haven't we learned anything
from the electrical power fiasco, the natural gas fiasco and now,
maybe, the water fiasco?</LD>
<LD>   When Summers states that price increases would keep the optimal
number of cars on the road, should we substitute "well-to-do people"?</LD>
<TE>   Dennis Beito</TE>
<TE>   Glendora</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where does one begin to respond to Summers' assertion that "the
problem of traffic congestion is what economists call a
tragedy-of-the-commons problem"? Where are we? In pre-Revolution
France? Summers goes on to suggest that "when congestion increased
because of holiday or commuter traffic, prices would increase to keep
the optimal number of cars on the road and traffic moving smoothly."
Why should my Spanish-speaking gardener want to be with his family on
the Fourth of July, or Labor Day, or Christmas?</TE>
<TE>   Why should lower-income people get a free pass? Charge him for it,
and charge him past his ability to pay! That's the answer to the
phenomenon of massive overdevelopment and imperfect planning that has
congested the freeways of Los Angeles (and the rest of Southern
California, a profoundly popular place to live).</TE>
<TE>   And lastly, he says that "people would take alternate routes."
This could include driving through housing tracts, near schools and
hospitals and the like--on a scale as yet unimagined. We already sit
idly by while the plutocrats reign in Washington. Don't let them take
the roads as well.</TE>

<LD>I am glad someone is addressing the interests of those who must
relinquish their trial rights in order to obtain employment or to
receive medical or other essential services ("The Justice-at-a-Price
Guys Take Aim at Arbitration," Commentary, Aug. 13). Representing
myself in an employment-related arbitration was disastrous: The
arbitrator clearly was biased in favor of the employer, who by law
was solely responsible for paying his extravagant fee and who also
probably can be counted on to provide repeat business--as long as the
employer receives favorable treatment in such proceedings.</LD>
<LD>   I will never sign another mandatory arbitration agreement until
the Legislature enacts meaningful legislation that adequately
protects consumers and holds unscrupulous arbitrators and employers
fully accountable for their illegal and unethical behavior.</LD>

<LD>Los Angeles lost a great man when John C. Argue died (obituary, Aug.
11). His life is a testament to the power of one. His leadership made
a difference in scores of institutions, including USC, the Los
Angeles Sports Council and the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.</LD>
<LD>   His arsenal was his vast network of friends and acquaintances,
whom he connected with each other when they asked or when he saw an
opportunity. His intelligence, humor, integrity, selflessness and
down-to-earth manner contributed to his influence and his impact.</LD>
<LD>   How lucky we are that his many accomplishments enriched Los
Angeles' civic life and institutions.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Void in Fiscal Leadership," editorial, Aug. 14: The views
expressed at President Bush's Waco economic summit were similar to
those of Herbert Hoover. What we need is leadership like Franklin D.
Roosevelt's. Instead of tax cuts, we need economic stimulus in the
form of improvement of infrastructure, which would put people to work
and encourage manufacturers to invest. Tax cuts do little to boost
the economy when interest rates are below 2%. The fear of deficits
has to be addressed; a repeal of the tax cuts and added taxes on the
affluent can address that.</LD>

<TE>   A bunch of corporate bigwigs fly across the country for a half-day
meeting, a fancy lunch and a photo op. They lobby a tax cut for
themselves, return home with no action plan but proclaim the economy
saved, then expense the trip to the shareholders. This was nothing
but a corporate boondoggle. The only thing missing was the golf game.</TE>

<TE>   Robert Scheer (Commentary, Aug. 13) does a good job of pointing
out corporate misdeeds that benefit politicians at the expense of the
taxpayers, but he has not done an equally good job of pointing out
that all parties participate in this game. Does he conveniently
forget former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's actions in protecting
his firm from losing money on Latin American loans, which ended up
costing the Treasury (you and me) a lot of money? Does he forget all
the sleepovers at the White House or the influence-peddling in the
Clinton administration, which resulted in bills or legislative action
benefiting some of these same companies that we are reading about?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Bush can be associated with some of the corporate pirates
that we are reading about, but so can almost all politicians. While
people like Scheer would like to make a big deal out of them, Bush's
previous personal business dealings are truly nonevents when compared
with the scandals we are reading about these days.</TE>

<TE>   Scheer is to be congratulated for continuing to expose the Bush
presidency and some of its fellow congressional Republicans for their
attempt to cover their tracks and connections to major business fraud
and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   After disclosures of losses (disguised as earnings) by Enron and
WorldCom, one need only look back at the "fuzzy math" issue raised by
then-presidential candidate Bush. One has to wonder and question
which side of the fuzzy math issue our appointed chief was on.</TE>

<LD>Richard Herman (letter, Aug. 13) justifies terrorism and writes that
the "Palestinians are using the only weapon available to them, the
suicide bomb." Is blowing up a bus of innocents really the only way
to resist injustice? Forty years ago, minorities in our country felt
powerless and lacked equality under the law. But the Palestinians,
not learning from history, decided not to use the one tool that
immediately grants a movement legitimacy: nonviolence. Imagine where
our country would be had Rosa Parks taken her seat on that Montgomery
bus--and exploded herself.</LD>

Palestinians to ponder: Chemical, biological and nuclear explosions
blow over the West Bank and Gaza, too.</TE>

<HD>Calculating the High Price of Traffic Tickets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I sympathize with "Paying for Parking," the Aug. 10 letter about the
high costs of tickets. I serve as an occasional temporary judge (pro
tem) in about 20 L.A.-area traffic courts, and I hear that complaint
often. The fines are calculated from a base amount, to which a
mandatory penalty amount of 170% is added. Each $10 of the fine gets
an extra $17 mandatory penalty. For example, a person driving solo in
the carpool lane (a $100 ticket) ends up paying $271 ($1 added to
fund Night Court, I'm told). I tell defendants to multiply their
ticket by 2.7 to get an estimate of what the total cost is. Working
backward, the letter writer's original ticket would have been about
$98; still high, but not as bad as the $265 he paid.</LD>
<LD>   It does seem unfair that any ticket gets virtually tripled as a
matter of course, so I encourage people who complain to take it up
with their legislator, either for revocation of the law or at least
fair notice. I feel that the city is using tickets as revenue
generators. And while this is in my financial advantage (to keep my
taxes from being raised--if I don't get a ticket myself, of course),
it is more important and fair that people should have fair notice of
the total fine they may pay as well as not be triple-charged for a
ticket.</LD>

<LD>Re Jonathan Turley's Aug. 14 commentary, "Camps for Citizens:
Ashcroft's Hellish Vision": Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's latest
proposal (which, of course, has received little publicity) brings to
mind the Hitler and Stalin regimes. It also shows that we do not
learn from history. Camps for U.S. citizens remind me of German and
Russian camps prior to and during World War II. If there is even the
least suspicion that anyone "may" be against the current
administration, declare him an enemy and toss him into a camp without
due process.</LD>
<LD>   I guess we can be thankful that Ashcroft has at least informed us
of his intentions and warned us to be like the monkeys and "see, hear
and speak no evil" about what this administration has in mind for us.</LD>

<HD>Cal State Channel Islands Ready for Big Day</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Rehearsal runs smoothly for the main show today
when 1,500 guests, including governor, arrive for the opening
ceremony.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The school's burgundy banners were all properly hung, the stage
microphones all set and the rows of white lawn chairs all arranged.</LD>
<LD>   The only thing missing was the 1,500 guests, including keynote
speaker Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   But Thursday was simply the dress rehearsal for the grand opening
ceremony for Cal State Channel Islands, Ventura County's first
four-year public university. The real ceremony is today.</LD>
<TE>   For the past few weeks more than 150 workers have been sprucing up
the campus and preparing for the big moment. At the center of all the
frenzied preparations is Nancy Covarrubias Gill, 41, the school's
associate director of development.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, Gill has been in charge of organizing the opening
celebration and making sure everything runs smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   It has been one of the biggest challenges in her career, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest task Thursday, however, was leading a giddy group of
about 50 faculty members, staff members and administrators in a dry
run of today's ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Gripping her walkie-talkie in one hand and her script in the
other, Gill quickly ran the group through an abbreviated version of
the event.</TE>
<TE>   She made sure everyone in the procession sat in their assigned
seat, that the microphones were properly adjusted for musicians and
that everyone followed the script.</TE>
<TE>   The practice session went fairly smoothly, though at times the
boisterous crowd heckled speakers and generally gave the event the
feel of a raucous wedding rehearsal.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Channel Islands economics professor Dennis Muraoka
filled in for the governor. After being ''introduced'' by college
President Richard Rush, Muraoka told the audience he had prepared
some remarks.</TE>
<TE>   ''You've all done an outstanding job of getting this university
started,'' he said. ''Therefore, even though I have not signed the
budget, I am doubling all your salaries, and I am doubling all your
vacation time.''</TE>
<TE>   Laughing audience members began chanting, "Four more years! Four
more years!''</TE>
<TE>   Rush also received a share of heckling, and at one point joked
that if the governor received a security detail, he wanted one too.</TE>
<TE>   Today's ceremony culminates a four-year effort to convert the
former Camarillo State Hospital into the California State University
system's 23rd campus, ending Ventura County's decades-long wait for a
public university.</TE>
<TE>   The new school will welcome its first class Aug. 26. So far, about
1,300 transfer students have enrolled for the first year.</TE>
<TE>   By 2025, the university is expected to be operating at full
capacity, serving up to 15,000 students, officials said.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District's former downtown

performing arts high school in the inner city."</LD>
<TE>   Billionaire philanthropist Eli Broad lent the district $600,000 to
revise plans and help build the academy at 450 N. Grand Ave. The
board approved the loan Tuesday and gave permission to change design
plans for the 1,500-student high school that had previously been
approved by the district and state.</TE>
<TE>   The 234,000-square-foot arts academy will include a theater as
well as rehearsal, music, production and dressing rooms. It will
provide specialized curricula in visual and performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids that live in this community deserve a world-class
school, and that is what we believe the arts academy will be," said
Melissa Bonney Ratcliff, a spokeswoman for the Broad Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Huizar said the school is worth the increased costs because the
students, who mostly come from low-income families, will have an
opportunity to experience a quality curriculum on a campus that is
near several distinguished art institutions downtown, such as the
Music Center.</TE>
<TE>   The additional costs for the arts academy would be covered under a
$3.3-billion construction bond measure, if it passes Nov. 5. As part
of the loan agreement with Broad, the district would not be required
to pay back the $600,000 interest-free loan if the bond issue fails.</TE>
<TE>   Broad, chairman of SunAmerica insurance company, is a confidant of
L.A. Unified Supt. Roy Romer who donated $16,000 to Alliance for a
Better Community, the nonprofit organization that was chosen by the
district to complete the Belmont Learning Center, another high school
in downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The district also recently used $100,000 donated by Broad to hire
the Rose &amp; Kindel lobbying firm to educate voters about the bond
measure.</TE>
<TE>   The board will vote on a resolution by Huizar at the end of the
month that would require admission to the arts academy to be reserved
only for downtown students.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot open it up to all [students] until we get all kids off
buses, send them to neighborhood schools and go back to traditional
calendars" instead of year-round schedules, Huizar said.</TE>
<TE>   The academy is scheduled to open in 2004.</TE>

<HD>Bid to Recall Arvin Mayor Falls Short</HD>
<DH>Ballot: Juan Olivares keeps post in Kern County farm town
by 81-vote margin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After counting final absentee ballots, Kern County elections
officials on Thursday announced that Arvin's combative mayor, Juan
Olivares, survived a contentious recall election.</LD>
<LD>   The final tally was 662 votes in favor of the recall and 743 votes
opposed. That means Olivares widened his margin of victory from 17 to
81 votes since the preliminary results were released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Elections officials counted the last 149 ballots Thursday. Many
were absentees. Some contained irregularities.</LD>
<TE>   Olivares, a former farm worker, was elected mayor in 2000 and
since then has stirred political hostilities in the southern San
Joaquin Valley farm town of 10,000. Several city officials have been
indicted by the Kern County Grand Jury on charges of fraud, and Dist.
Atty. Ed Jagels said the grand jury is not yet through investigating
allegations of corruption in town.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares' chief opponent in the recall, Joet Stoner, 25, a
substitute teacher, said Olivares has stirred up racial animosities
in town by threatening to drive whites away.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares denies that but says the previous city government was
hostile to minorities' needs.</TE>
<TE>   Once dominated by white farm and business interests, Arvin is now
more than 95% Latino.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Officer Pleads Guilty in Sex Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Alhambra police officer pleaded guilty in federal court
Thursday to violating a motorist's civil rights by trying to sexually
assault her after a traffic stop.</LD>
<LD>   Benny Marquez, 32, faces a possible sentence of six to 12 months
in prison under terms of a plea bargain with prosecutors.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing before U.S. District Court Judge A. Howard Matz, Marquez
reversed his earlier claim that the sexual encounter was consensual.</LD>
<TE>   Marquez stopped the woman for a traffic violation during the early
morning hours of Jan. 25, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   During the ensuing exchange, he told her to choose between being
his "friend" or receiving a $500 traffic ticket, Assistant U.S. Atty.
Tom O'Brien told the court.</TE>
<TE>   Later that day, O'Brien said, Marquez went to the woman's home,
flashed his badge and tried to force her to have sex with him. He
left after she resisted and began screaming.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, a Chinese immigrant who speaks poor English, filed a
complaint against Marquez with the Alhambra Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-year veteran was relieved of duty and then fired after
an internal affairs probe.</TE>
<TE>   The victim also sued Marquez and the city in U.S. court, alleging
severe emotional injuries and distress. The case was settled for an
undisclosed sum.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
declined to prosecute Marquez, citing insufficient evidence.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesperson said the prosecutor's office had considered
charging the officer with sexual battery and assault with intent to
rape, but decided not to because it was unclear who initiated the
sexual contact.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, a federal grand jury indicted Marquez on two
counts of acting under the color of law to deprive the woman of her
constitutional rights. One of those counts was dropped under the plea
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez, who is free on bond, and his lawyer, Todd Rash, declined
to talk to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Sentencing was set for Dec. 16.</TE>

<HD>Belmont Shore Rapist Suspected as Woman Fights, Scratches
Intruder</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man abandons the assault and flees. Long Beach
police say he has marks on his chest and possibly on his face and
arms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA L. ESPARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police believe that an intruder who broke into a woman's Long Beach
home Thursday morning, nude with a cloth over his face, is the man
responsible for a string of sexual attacks dating to 1996.</LD>
<LD>   The man entered the 33-year-old woman's home at Ximeno Avenue and
Burnett Street about 2 a.m., said Long Beach Police Sgt. Paul
LeBaron.</LD>
<LD>   The woman struggled and left scratches on his chest and possibly
his face and arms. He ran away without sexually attacking her.</LD>
<TE>   LeBaron said police "believe there is a connection" between this
attack and the so-called Belmont Shore rapist, who has sexually
assaulted 11 women since 1996. The first attack occurred in Seattle;
eight have occurred in Long Beach and one each in Huntington Beach
and Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   Police also believe he has unsuccessfully tried to rape three
other women, including the one Thursday, who was treated at a
hospital for minor injuries, and a 75-year-old Huntington Beach woman
Tuesday. She also fought off the attacker and forced him to flee.</TE>
<TE>   The man apparently selects his victims carefully, said Cmdr. Linda
Beardslee of the Police Department's sexual assault task force. He
appears to know that the women live alone and leave doors and windows
unlocked.</TE>
<TE>   Police don't have a detailed description because he covers his
face or the faces of his victims. He is 5 feet 9 to 6 feet tall, with
an average build, LeBaron said. He does not use a weapon and seems to
know the area well because he always manages to elude police.</TE>
<TE>   His victims have ranged in age from 32 to 80. In Los Alamitos, the
same night he attacked a 72-year-old, another woman fought him off
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after receiving the call on Thursday's attack, police with
patrol cars, dogs and helicopters blocked off a perimeter around the
victim's home and scoured the city.</TE>
<TE>   They abandoned the search after about six hours.</TE>
<TE>   Beardslee asked the public to scrutinize friends, husbands,
co-workers and acquaintances for any fresh scratches on their faces,
arms or bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at people you know," she said. "There's somebody out there
with these telltale scratches."</TE>
<TE>   Police ask that anyone with information on this or any other
attack call the sexual assault hotline at (866) 600-1110.</TE>

<LD>The owner of a Van Nuys tax preparation firm pleaded guilty to filing
returns in the names of fictitious people seeking more than $322,000
in refunds, the U.S. attorney's office said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Alvarez, 41, owner of A&amp;B Professional Services, submitted
bogus W-2 forms to the Internal Revenue Service purporting to show
that the nonexistent taxpayers had substantial amounts of money
withheld from winnings at Southern California race tracks, along with

<LD>The California Department of Transportation has suspended rent
increases on homes it owns in Pasadena, South Pasadena and El Sereno
along the route of the proposed Long Beach Freeway extension.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans had described the rent increases, which were to have
taken effect Aug. 1, as 10%. But tenants said the agency was forcing
increases as high as 23%. In a letter to Assemblywoman Carol Liu
(D-La Canada Flintridge), who has been working on behalf of the
tenants, Caltrans director Jeff Morales said the agency has suspended
all rent hikes until Jan. 1.</LD>

<HD>Morgan Evans, 92; Directed Landscaping at Disney Parks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Morgan "Bill" Evans, who guided the landscape design of Disney's
theme parks for half a century, from the planning of Disneyland to
consulting in the planning for Hong Kong Disneyland, expected to open
three years from now, has died. He was 92.</LD>
<LD>   Evans, of Malibu, died Saturday at St. John's Hospital in Santa
Monica. The cause was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   Although he officially retired from Disney in 1975, he continued
to work as a design and landscaping consultant until just weeks ago,
Disney officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Throughout his career, Evans imported vegetation from around the
world to create accurate fictional settings that amplify the
storylines of Disney's various attractions--from the giant bamboo,
ficus and towering palms of the Jungle Cruise in the Anaheim park to
the African plants that he brought to Disney's Animal Kingdom in
Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Evans' knowledge of plants was legendary, colleagues said, and his
skill at matching plants to a story can be seen everywhere in the
parks, from the forest on the Tom Sawyer Adventure in Anaheim to a
planned jungle in the Tokyo park, which has to use heaters to
preserve the plants in winter.</TE>
<TE>   And he cared about even the most minor details. "He could walk
through the park and tell you where every specimen, every tree and
plant came from," said Marty Sklar, vice chairman of Disney
Imagineering, who oversees the creative team for the theme parks and
worked with Evans since Disneyland's opening.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of Walt's favorites," Sklar told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Evans and his brother Jack came to work for the Disney company
after designing the landscaping for Walt Disney's Holmby Hills home,
in particular the Carolwood Pacific Railroad in his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   A young Walt Disney had met the Evans family years earlier, when
he came to buy some roses from their nursery for his three-bedroom
house in the San Fernando Valley, said Paul Comstock, director of
landscape design at Disney, who was a protege of Evans.</TE>
<TE>   An expert in his field, Evans was also practical.</TE>
<TE>   At a dinner in 1965 celebrating Disneyland's 10th anniversary,
"Walt recalled how when they were getting close to opening the park,
they were running out of money," Sklar said, "so he told Bill to use
smaller plants and to put Latin names on all of them. Walt said,
'Bill never ran out of Latin names; he even put them on the weeds.' "</TE>
<TE>   A third-generation horticulturalist, Evans was born in Santa
Monica on June 30, 1910, to a wealthy family that had helped develop
Lido Island in what is now Newport Beach in the early part of the
century.</TE>
<TE>   When the family was hit hard by the stock market crash in 1929,
Evans left Stanford University, where he was studying engineering, to
help his father, Hugh, and brother Jack turn a backyard garden of
exotic plants into the prospering Evans &amp; Reeves nursery in West Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Although the nursery closed in the 1960s, Hugh Evans is remembered
today for introducing exotic plants to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Among his many legacies are the rows of flowering coral trees that
line San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood, all of which originated with
cuttings he brought from South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   When he started working in Anaheim in the early 1950s, Bill Evans
used his instinct for preserving native plants to figure out which of
the site's trees could be saved for use in the park.</TE>
<TE>   The 1950s were also a time when large tracts of nearby land were
being razed to build the region's interstate freeway system, and
Evans regularly stopped highway workers from bulldozing trees.</TE>
<TE>   "He perfected a way of moving trees--drilling a hole in the trunk
and lifting it with a steel pole," Sklar said.</TE>
<TE>   One such moment came when Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles
was being razed for a parking structure. "Bill got there at 4 in the
morning and saved those trees," Sklar said. Many of these, and other
rescued vegetation, still grace the theme park. They made it seem
more established when it opened, and today look as if they've always
been there.</TE>
<TE>   On the Mark Twain Riverboat Ride at Disneyland, a lush forest was
built to replicate all of the native species that line the rivers of
North America. The trees include locally grown conifers, London plane
trees and their cousin, the California sycamore, as well as the
European birch, all widely available in Southern California when
Disneyland was built, Comstock said. "He would select trees that
would replicate the storytelling environment, and that's what he
taught us to do."</TE>
<TE>   The sculpted plants of Dumbo and other characters also are an
Evans touch. "Walt had been to Europe and seen some topiary" that was
probably a century old, Evans recalled in an interview in The Times
in 1989. "I told him, 'Walt, the stuff you see will probably take us
20 years.' "</TE>
<TE>   Undaunted, Evans crafted a facsimile in just two years by avoiding
the usual wire frames and bending full-grown plants to fit the
shapes. "We started off with a crocodile and the hippos from
'Fantasia,' " Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   In his long and diverse career, Evans was also a writer for Sunset
magazine, a trustee for the Los Angeles County Arboretum and a fellow
of the American Society of Landscape Architects.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Natalie; son Pete Evans and daughter
Barrie Evans-Blattau; stepdaughters Michele Novak and Stephene Scott;
grandchildren Caitlin, Jackson and Morgan Lili; and
great-granddaughter Isabella.</TE>
<TE>   A "Bon Voyage Celebration" in remembrance of Bill Evans is
scheduled for 5 p.m. Sept. 25 at Descanso Gardens, 1418 Descanso
Drive, La Canada-Flintridge.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family asks that contributions go to the
charity of the donor's choice or to the Descanso Garden Guild,
Development Department, for the Bill Evans Horticultural Collection
Fund.</TE>

<HD>Child-Welfare Group on Baby Girl's Death: 'The System
Failed'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials of a private child welfare agency in Anaheim charged
Thursday that police and county social workers repeatedly visited the
home of 1-year-old Samantha Rose Gutierrez before the girl died of
starvation and neglect in March.</LD>
<LD>   "Somehow the system failed," said Lorri Galloway, executive
director of the Eli Home, a private, nonprofit agency that had
contacted authorities about the child. "This was so blatant. There
were broken bones and black eyes. This will happen again unless
something drastically changes."</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Social Services Agency is investigating its
handling of the case. But the agency as well as the Anaheim Police
Department dispute Galloway's timeline of the events leading to
Samantha's death.</LD>
<TE>   Galloway said that from November to shortly before the girl's
death March 26, Anaheim police and workers from the county Social
Services Agency visited the Gutierrez home at least five times.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Home officials, who held a news conference Thursday, said the
number of visits is partly based on information from Dulce Soriano,
27, a housemate of the Gutierrez family who made the first complaints
to the Eli Home about possible abuse of Samantha.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano recalled that she saw police at the duplex on North Harbor
Boulevard in November and December, but she did not know why they
were there. She said social workers were at the home twice during the
same months.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Galloway said, Anaheim police and county social
workers were contacted at least twice in January, prompting police to
visit the home to look for signs of child abuse. She recalled making
one of the calls herself after officers went to the home.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Services Agency has the power to take children from
their parents if there is immediate risk of harm, but in this case
Samantha remained at home.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Mike Hidalgo, a police spokesman, said the department
received only two calls related to Samantha--one about possible child
abuse and the other the day she died.</TE>
<TE>   Two officers spent 40 minutes at the Gutierrez home Jan. 17,
Hidalgo said. They found no obvious signs of abuse after questioning
the parents and checking on Samantha as well as her sister and two
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The Social Services Agency is reviewing its handling of the
Gutierrez matter. A report could be sent to the presiding judge of
Orange County Juvenile Court within 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Riley, head of the agency's Children and Family Services
Department, said the only involvement county social workers had with
the Gutierrez case was in January. He also said he has no
documentation supporting the Eli Home's contention that Galloway
personally notified the county about possible abuse after the police
visited Samantha's home Jan. 17.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Orange County coroner's office concluded that the
baby's death was a homicide, prompting police to resume their
investigation. Authorities said that the girl's parents are suspects
but that there have been no arrests so far.</TE>

<HD>8 Charged in Scheme to Bilk Golfers</HD>
<DH>Crime: The men are accused of refusing to return nearly $6
million in deposits that were paid for testing clubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE HERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eight people were arrested Thursday on a federal indictment charging
them with bilking golfers out of more than $5.8 million in a
nationwide telemarketing scam based in Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Police say that owners and associates of Professional Golf
Products in Huntington Beach conned golfers out of security deposits
required to "test play" what they thought were state-of-the-art golf
clubs.</LD>
<LD>   According to Assistant U.S. Atty. Kenneth Julian, victims were
talked into testing the golf clubs for 60 days and were required to
pay a security deposit of $1,000 to $1,600.</LD>
<TE>   When the victims returned the clubs--in some cases before the end
of the test period because they were unhappy with the quality and
demanded their deposits back--PGP failed or refused to return the
deposits, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Julian, PGP stalled by not returning victims' phone
calls seeking the refunds. The firm, he said, also made getting a
refund more complicated by requiring victims to get company approval
before they could return the clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs were packaged and shipped from three Huntington Beach
offices, authorities said, with the firm's telemarketing "boiler
rooms" operating out of offices in Fountain Valley, Lakewood and Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said PGP operated the scam for nearly two years until
being shut down in June 2001 by the County of Orange Boiler Room
Apprehension task force. Thursday's arrests were the culmination of a
months-long process of interviewing victims and employees.</TE>
<TE>   Charged in the case are PGP owners John Tepel, 51, of Huntington
Beach and Warren Crawford, 44, of Lakewood. Also charged were Glenn
Totten, 43, of Long Beach; Marvin Walker, 46, of Costa Mesa; Larry
Brock, 40, of Garden Grove; and Thorin Scott, 42, of Huntington
Beach. Steven Parker, 48, owner of Icon and Golfer's Choice, two
companies used by PGP for telemarketing services, and Icon and
Golfer's Choice sales manager Rick Winters, 51, of Costa Mesa, also
face charges.</TE>
<TE>   A ninth man, Tony Perotta, 43, was being sought.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Shaun Wettgen said that scams
targeting golfers are increasing because of the sport's popularity
and he warned players to be cautious about doing business over the

<TE>   "I would remind anybody who is solicited to use common sense," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "They are in control of the phone call, and if [something] sounds
too good to be true, just hang up and check places like the Better
Business Bureau."</TE>
<TE>   Five of the eight defendants were released Thursday on bail
ranging from $20,000 to $125,000. The remaining defendants are in
custody awaiting bail hearings. Arraignment for all eight has been
set for Aug. 26.</TE>

<HD>Housing, Job Pinch Increases O.C.'s Homeless</HD>
<DH>Economy: Experts say the ranks are up 17% in a year--called
comparable to other regions--partly because of a gap in
affordability.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shortage of affordable housing and disappearing jobs combined to
boost Orange County's homeless population 17% in the past year,
according to county records.</LD>
<LD>   In a study released last week, 23,132 homeless people were counted
in a March survey of shelters and agencies that assist the needy, up
from 19,741 a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a trend that's comparable with other regions of the
country," said Karen Roper, the county's homeless prevention
coordinator. "We are not alone. The numbers keep going up
nationwide."</LD>
<TE>   Homelessness in Orange County has risen steadily since 1998. Some
of the growth is due to the county's booming population, Roper said,
but the biggest factor fueling the increase is escalating housing
costs.</TE>
<TE>   In the past year, higher housing prices combined with higher
unemployment to further squeeze the working poor, especially
families, said county officials and social workers. About 70% of the
county's homeless population is made up of families with children.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's unemployment rate reached 4.1% in July, up from
3.4% a year earlier. Meanwhile, the percentage of those able to buy a
median-priced home slid to 22% in June, down from 29% a year earlier,
according to a study by the California Assn. Of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just gotten worse and worse," said Sheri Barrios, executive
director of the Orange Coast Interfaith emergency shelter in Costa
Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   "Rents in Orange County have skyrocketed and wages haven't kept
up," she said. "You can have two people in jobs making $8 an hour and
they can't afford housing for their children."</TE>
<TE>   The shelter, which takes telephone reservations each day beginning
at 9 a.m. for its 65 spaces, is full nearly every day.</TE>
<TE>   "Many days, we are full by 10 minutes after 9," Barrios said.</TE>
<TE>   About $30 million in public and private money will be spent this
year in the county on programs, services and housing for the
homeless.</TE>
<TE>   But Orange County's 2,887 shelter beds aren't nearly enough to
meet short-term emergency needs, county officials said. Last year,
more than 13,000 people were turned away from county shelters because
they were full.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most acute shortages is shelter for families.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Coast Interfaith is one of two facilities in the county
with emergency shelter for poor families. The Salvation Army's
Hospitality House in Santa Ana is the other. In July, 90 families,
including 270 children, stayed there; 450 people were turned away.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be at the first of the month, when people got their
assistance checks, we'd have empty beds; people would splurge and
stay in a motel for a few days," said Beverly Freeman, director of
social services for the Salvation Army in Orange County. "That's not
happening anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The Salvation Army has budgeted $1.5 million to build or renovate
a property for a 50-bed family shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The organization has asked Orange city officials to help it
identify an industrial location where a shelter wouldn't run into
resistance from homeowners. South County is another area being
examined.</TE>
<TE>   "South County is thought of as being the more affluent part of the
community, and it is," said Lee Lescano, the Salvation Army's county
coordinator, who hopes to begin construction on the shelter within a
year. "But there are pockets in San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano,
even Laguna Beach, where there are homeless, high poverty and a
need."</TE>
<TE>   The county based its numbers on a complex formulation of head
counts and surveys of homeless shelters. The homeless survey is
required to qualify for federal housing funds.</TE>

<HD>Parents Lose Fight Over Inglewood 'Honors High'</HD>
<DH>Education: Many say their children will leave college-prep
program after officials choose an under-performing school as new
location.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents fighting the proposed relocation of City Honors High School
in Inglewood were dealt a final blow when school board members voted
to house it at one of the city's under-performing high schools.</LD>
<LD>   City Honors, which offered students college preparatory course
work and a chance to earn college credit, will continue to exist, but
critics said it will be a far cry from what planners envisioned and
parents wanted for their children.</LD>
<LD>   The school originally had been located on the campus of West Los
Angeles College in Culver City, but the college's announcement that
it would no longer have the space to house City Honors left district
officials scrambling to find a new location.</LD>
<TE>   The solution--to make it an "academy" within Morningside High
School--was unacceptable to many parents, who worried about the
school's performance on standardized test scores and about crime on
and around campus.</TE>
<TE>   The board voted late Wednesday night to relocate to Morningside,
after listening to parents say the district had failed some of its
highest-performing students at a key time in their lives.</TE>
<TE>   By placing City Honors at Morningside, parents said, their
children would end up at one of the schools they'd tried so hard to
avoid. For the last two years, both of the high schools in Inglewood
have received the lowest possible ranking--1 out of 10--on the
state's Academic Performance Index.</TE>
<TE>   About 150 students who accepted admittance to City Honors will be
affected. About 34 have asked for waivers to attend other districts.
Some of the rest said they will use relatives' addresses to attend
schools in other districts.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to put down the Morningside community," said Destini
Ashton, whose daughter Ashli attended City Honors last year. "Just
like everywhere else, there's good and bad. But I, as a parent, don't
have to unnecessarily subject my child to the bad."</TE>
<TE>   Ashton is not sure what her daughter will do, but she is adamantly
against sending her to Morningside. "She'll go live with relatives
and go to school in another state if she has to."</TE>
<TE>   Other parents are taking a wait-and-see attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as she's there, I'm going to be on top of things to make
sure things are being done correctly," said Peter Blake, whose
daughter, Nancy, 15, attended City Honors last year. "She's going to
make the best of it. The environment isn't going to dictate how well
she does."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, district officials had explored another location,
but decided that it would be too costly for the school district.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't something we could recommend in good conscience," Supt.
Paul Possemato told parents at the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   City Honors students will not be in separate bungalows as
originally planned, but they will be grouped in the same classes at
Morningside, Possemato said.</TE>
<TE>   The district has not yet secured any written agreements with local
colleges to teach classes specifically for City Honors students,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to preserve this program for our young people,"
Possemato said. "The faculty at the school is enthusiastic about
having them there."</TE>
<TE>   Parents at the meeting said they were not surprised by the board's
decision. They will take their children elsewhere, they said, and
will work to have certain school board members ousted come election
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize it's over and we won't be able to fix City Honors,"
said parent Fred Black. "Now it extends further than that. We'll take
this to the ballot box."</TE>
<TE>   Some parents said they are in preliminary discussions to start a
charter high school for gifted students.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood Animo Leadership Charter High School, which will
open its doors for the first time Aug. 26, is the city's only charter
high school. It accepts students through a lottery system. The
school's founder had to take his case to the State Board of Education
when the Inglewood school district rejected his charter proposal.</TE>
<TE>   City Honors was born out of the district's desire to implement its
own reforms.</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers OK Inmate DNA Testing</HD>
<DH>Politics: Prisoners would be forced to provide samples
under bill passed by Assembly. Trigger locks on old guns, ban on
playground smoking also approved.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Entering the home stretch of the lawmaking year, the California
Assembly began deciding the fate of dozens of bills Thursday and
approved a measure allowing authorities to use force on inmates who
refuse DNA testing.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a bill supported by an array of Hollywood celebrities
to cap recording-industry contracts at seven years was pulled by its
author as it appeared headed for defeat in an Assembly committee, and
the committee's chairwoman declared it dead.</LD>
<LD>   With the end of the legislative session coming Aug. 31, bringing
with it the death of hundreds of bills at the stroke of midnight,
lawmakers began making a final push Thursday to pass financial
privacy protection by reviving a bill that stalled last year.</LD>
<TE>   The measure, SB 773 by Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough),
initially sought to prevent banks and other financial institutions
from selling or trading a customer's private information without
obtaining formal consent.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is now expected to be amended in hopes of removing at
least some of the strong opposition from banks, insurers and credit
services, and its details are in flux.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers also approved legislation by Sen. Jack Scott
(D-Altadena) to require state-sanctioned trigger locks on older guns
before they can be resold, and a bill by Assemblyman Juan Vargas
(D-San Diego) to ban smoking within 25 feet of a playground. The
Scott bill, SB 1670, must still obtain final Senate approval, while
the Vargas bill, AB 1867, now goes to the desk of Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The DNA bill, SB 1242 by Senate Republican Leader Jim Brulte
(R-Rancho Cucamonga), seeks to clear up ambiguities in state law that
some authorities say prevent them from forcing inmates to provide DNA
samples.</TE>
<TE>   The samples, which would be used to determine whether the inmates
had committed other crimes, would be entered in a database run by the
office of Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, who strongly supports the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "We contend there was no need for the bill. But obviously, if
there are any ambiguities in the law, this will clear them up," said
Manuel Valencia, a spokesman for the Department of Justice. "This
gets everyone on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) objected to the
legislation on grounds that it would encroach on inmates' 5th
Amendment rights.</TE>
<TE>   Some inmates "might be the scum of the earth," Goldberg argued,
but "they have a right not to incriminate themselves."</TE>
<TE>   However, Assemblyman Dick Dickerson (R-Redding), a former police
officer, noted that authorities are already granted power to demand
fingerprints and Breathalyzer tests from suspected criminals, and
said the DNA samples would be no different. The measure now awaits
final Senate passage.</TE>
<TE>   The recording contract bill, SB 1246 by Sen. Kevin Murray
(D-Culver City), garnered strong support from music stars, including
Don Henley and Beck. A number of artists even held benefit concerts
to raise money and awareness for the cause. But it encountered stiff
opposition from the Recording Industry Assn. of America, and the two
sides were unable to find a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   While Murray stopped short of declaring the bill dead for the year
Thursday, he acknowledged he had been unable to bridge differences.
Assemblywoman Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga), whose Arts, Entertainment,
Sports, Tourism and Internet Media Committee was scheduled to debate
the legislation Thursday, was more direct.</TE>
<TE>   Cohn said in a statement that the contract issue was finished for
the year because Murray "chose to walk away" and that the panel would
now focus on music privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Thursday, a measure to give movie and television
productions millions of dollars in wage-tax breaks to keep them from
going out of state suffered a setback in the state Senate and may now
survive only in watered-down form.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation by Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City),
AB 2747, is backed by both labor unions and studio executives, who
believe its financial rewards would keep film shoots in California
and away from Canada, where production costs are cheaper.</TE>
<TE>   But critics, including influential Senate Democrats, have balked
at the notion of providing years of tax breaks to the film industry
when the state is in the midst of a $23.6-billion budget shortfall
and is facing additional budget problems in the next few years.</TE>

<HD>Alfred Ligon, 96; Started Oldest Black Bookstore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alfred Ligon, founder of the country's oldest continuously operated
black-owned bookstore whose belief in metaphysics eased his sorrow
over the store's razing in the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, has died.
He was 96.</LD>
<LD>   Ligon died Saturday at Beverly Hospital in Montebello after a
period of poor health, said longtime bookstore volunteer S. Pearl
Sharp.</LD>
<LD>   Ligon opened the Aquarian Book Shop in 1941 and watched its
success rise and fall with society's interest in black history.
Opened when Los Angeles' population was less than 5% African
American, the store was ahead of its time in promoting black writers
and cultural development.</LD>
<TE>   Ligon opened the shop with $100 saved from his salary as a
Southern Pacific Railroad waiter. He bought fiction, nonfiction and
metaphysics books from a secondhand shop downtown. The store puttered
along until the civil rights movement and corresponding interest in
black history transformed the shop into a hub of cultural activity:
lectures, classes on black history, small theatrical productions.</TE>
<TE>   Works by Harlem Renaissance luminaries including Langston Hughes
and hosted authors such as Alex Haley and Maya Angelou were well
stocked. Ligon, who ran the shop with his wife, Bernice, also made
available to researchers his collection of historic documents that
included drafts of Marcus Garvey's speeches and letters of W.E.B.
DuBois.</TE>
<TE>   The Aquarian was a beacon to West Coast blacks searching for
enrichment, said Angelou, who first visited the store in 1955. She
admired the Ligons' courteous, graceful manner as much as their
thorough selection.</TE>
<TE>   "Their most ragged itinerant was treated with as much respect and
elegance as well-dressed professionals or academics who came in
there," she said by phone from her home in Winston-Salem, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles writer Earl Ofari Hutchinson, who started visiting
the shop as a Los Angeles City College student in 1963, the store and
its resources were a revelation at a time when Southern California
was isolated from the civil rights mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "He created an environment of comfort and intellectual
stimulation," Hutchinson said. "There were no pretensions about him,
no ivory tower intellectualism. He strongly felt he had a duty to
really be a solid mentor to young people and point them in the right
direction in terms of understanding their past."</TE>
<TE>   As interest in African American history faded and black bookstores
around the country started closing, Ligon kept the shop open as a
community service, he told The Times in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a starvation business," he said. "But we're an institution.
Even just a trickle of people who want these books justifies our
existence."</TE>
<TE>   That sense of obligation compelled Ligon to reopen the store after
the site at Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Western Avenue was
reduced to ashes in the 1992 riots--a year after its 50th anniversary
and days after Rosa Parks gave a talk there.</TE>
<TE>   A week after the riots, Ligon was philosophical about the loss,
using his belief in metaphysics principles to cope.</TE>
<TE>   He saw the destruction of the store and its 7,000 volumes as part
of a 500-year cosmic cycle that would enable a phoenix to rise from
its ashes.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that these things had to be destroyed to give one an
opportunity to move to a higher stage," he told The Times. He later
added that he didn't blame the looters.</TE>
<TE>   "They were expressing their joy and sorrow and a change in
consciousness," he said. "I can't mourn over that."</TE>
<TE>   A consortium of independent bookstores organized donations and a
benefit with Angelou and Alice Walker that raised more than $70,000
for the store's rebuilding on Adams Boulevard. But the store never
regained its momentum, and it closed in 1994 after Bernice Ligon was
diagnosed with liver cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The couple continued to provide materials from their home, with
Alfred Ligon giving talks on African spiritualism and black history
in a room he had transformed into a lecture hall.</TE>
<TE>   Ligon was born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, where he worked
as a ballroom dance instructor and printer's apprentice. He came to
Los Angeles in 1936 to study metaphysics, and soon bought the book
from which he would derive his store's name, "The Aquarian Gospel of
Jesus Christ," a 1907 work that described a purported period of
travel and learning in Christ's life.</TE>
<TE>   He met his wife in 1942 and asked her to sell books in his store.
The couple married in 1948, and she died two years ago of cancer at
88.</TE>
<TE>   Ligon is survived by his daughter, Jeni Terrell; son, Alfred Lloyd
Ligon; sister, Jeni LeGon; six grandchildren; and several
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is being planned for September.</TE>

<HD>Termite Bill Shows a Whole Lot of Eating Was Going On at
Elvis' House</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the new book "The Perfect Store: Inside EBay," author Adam Cohen
recounts how "a lucky Elvis fan beat out 46 other bidders to pay $811
for the pest control agreement from Elvis' home" on Hillcrest Drive.
Wow. Between the termites and Elvis, there must have been a lot of
eating going on in that house.</LD>
<LD>   Beverly Beach? Bill Fawcett of Tujunga was perusing the Weather
Channel's online page when he noticed an apparent tsunami warning for
the Westside (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   Last time I saw a tidal forecast for Beverly Hills was when Peter
Fonda was surfing down Santa Monica Boulevard in the 1996 disaster
flick "Escape From L.A." What with the tidal wave and all, traffic
was just a mess that day.</LD>
<TE>   Your columnist feels so naive: Regarding the upside-down
pedestrian symbol that graced this page (see photo), a woman named
Lilith wrote, "Am I the only one who saw a Playboy bunny?"</TE>
<TE>   No, I heard the same theory from a male caller who wouldn't give
his name because "I don't want my wife to know I ever looked at the
magazine." Playboy has a magazine?</TE>
<TE>   This sounds like a Beverly Hills item: Elizabeth Gutman spotted a
dumpster that seemed to be reserved for the latest in discards only
(see photo). It was in Santa Ana. You might have guessed that the
name of the eatery is the New Panda.</TE>
<TE>   Tired of having your smogs turned away? I spotted a shop off the
San Gabriel River Freeway that says you won't have such a problem
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Just asking: Reporter Rosalie Fox saw a billboard for the latest
"Stuart Little" movie on Short Street in Culver City, which makes
sense, but Dave Kase of Palos Verdes Estates wonders how the movie
"XXX" can be rated PG-13.</TE>
<TE>   Making L.A. disappear: I mentioned an Eastern newspaper's article
about a bill-signing by Gray Davis at the Griffith Park Observatory,
which was accompanied by a photo of Davis, bill in hand, near the
Golden Gate Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   That brought a note from film-flub hunter Bill Givens, author of
"Roman Soldiers Don't Wear Watches."</TE>
<TE>   He said that in the 1991 film "The Doctor," William Hurt and
Elizabeth Perkins are on the roof of an office building from which
you can "clearly see the downtown Los Angeles skyline (Library Tower,
Gas Co. building, etc.).</TE>
<TE>   "Then they walk across the roof and the camera pans around to a
shot of the Bay Bridge in San Francisco. I characterized it as one of
the greatest long-range lenses in movie history."</TE>
<TE>   You'd better still wear boots: Michael Bird of Calabasas notes
that a sign at the entrance to a nearby mountain trail in the Santa
Monica Mountains Conservancy Parkland says "dogs must be on leash and
cleaned up after."</TE>
<TE>   Fine, said Bird, so a hiker then only has to be careful not to
step in "cow pies, horse droppings, deer droppings, coyote droppings,
sheep droppings, goat droppings, and probably bobcat poop."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: A colleague passed along an ad offering "Satanic
Kittens and a momma Devil Cat free to a good servant." Satanic
kittens, devilish cats? Aren't they all?</TE>

<HD>Dockworkers Rally at New Pier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 1,500 dockworkers held a boisterous rally Thursday a few yards
from the opening-day celebration at Maersk Sealand's sprawling Pier
400 in the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The groups were separated by a long wall of 40-foot cargo
containers apparently erected by Maersk so invited foreign
dignitaries and local officials would not catch sight of the union
activity.</LD>
<LD>   Not to be ignored, the union members, locked in labor talks with
the Pacific Maritime Assn., repeatedly shouted, "No contract, no
peace!" The union also hired two airplanes to fly over the Maersk
event with banners that said, "ILWU Wants a Contract Now!"</LD>
<TE>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific
Maritime Assn., which represents 79 shipping and stevedore firms,
including Maersk, have been at the bargaining table since a contract
covering 10,500 West Coast port workers expired July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Now, facing federal intervention in the labor dispute, the union
has been staging numerous rallies and demonstrations from Portland to
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, about 2,000 union members and supporters marched
through downtown Long Beach to protest the Bush administration's
plans for bringing in federal troops to run the Los Angeles-Long
Beach port complex in the event the two sides fail to reach an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   But Thursday's rally was the first to target a specific employer,
in this case, the world's largest shipping firm during the grand
opening of its new 484-acre terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Union leader Dave Arian called Thursday's demonstration "the start
of Phase 2: making these companies accountable in the bargaining
process."</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the back of a pickup truck and speaking through an
amplifier, he said, "This is going to be a long fight. We're shoring
up and going into battle."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Boyd, spokesman for Maersk, whose world headquarters are in
Denmark, said, "We respect the union's right to communicate its
message in any way it deems appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   The union rally, he added, "would not impact business" at the
terminal, which he claimed will generate more than 58,000 jobs over
the course of its 25-year lease with the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a joint hearing of California Senate and Assembly
committees covering labor issues will convene at the Banning Landing
Community Center in Wilmington.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting will be chaired by Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar) and
Assembly member Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood).</TE>
<TE>   A Pacific Maritime spokesman said Thursday that "what's important
is to get back to the table as soon as circumstances allow, so we can
have tough negotiations that will result in a successful contract."</TE>
<TE>   The main contract negotiations in San Francisco have been
temporarily recessed since Tuesday, when ILWU President James
Spinosa's father died in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Kyle Rote, 74; Was Record-Setter as a N.Y. Giant Receiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kyle Rote, a record-setting receiver for the New York Giants so
popular that several teammates named children after him, died
Wednesday of cardiopulmonary complications at a Baltimore hospital.
He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Rote was a longtime smoker who suffered from emphysema in recent
years and last week underwent emergency surgery.</LD>
<LD>   An All-American at Southern Methodist University, Rote caught 300
passes for 4,797 yards--a 16-yard average--and 48 touchdowns as a
Giant. He was the team's career receiving leader when he retired and
is currently sixth among Giants. His 312 points are 10th best in
franchise history.</LD>
<TE>   According to his son, Kyle Rote Jr., a onetime professional soccer
star and now a National Football League player agent, 14 former
Giants--including Jimmy Patton, Don Heinrich and Pat Summerall--named
children after his father. Hall of Fame running back Frank Gifford
has a son and granddaughter named Kyle, both in honor of Rote.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an artist, he was a poet, and he was a kind, gentle man
who was a great athlete," Gifford said. "That's pretty rare."</TE>
<TE>   Rote joined the Giants in 1951, a year before Gifford, and tore a
knee ligament his rookie season when he stepped in a hole at a
preseason practice in Jonesboro, Ark. He never fully recovered and
wound up moving to receiver. "He had an incredible career,
considering he did it on one leg," Gifford said. "Had he not stepped
in the hole, he would be in the Hall of Fame and I probably wouldn't
be."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants won the right to select Rote through a special lottery.
At SMU, he shared the same backfield with legendary running back Doak
Walker. As a senior in 1950, Rote ran for 762 yards, passed for 490
and scored 13 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "He was so good at everything, whether it was pingpong, pool or
kicking off," Giant owner Wellington Mara said Thursday of Rote. "The
outstanding backs of that era were Alex Webster and Frank Gifford.
Before Kyle hurt his knee, he was as powerful a runner as Webster was
and as smooth a runner and as good a receiver as Gifford was. He just
had so much ability."</TE>
<TE>   Rote, a team captain 10 times in 11 seasons, had such an
understanding of the game that the Giants once sent him on the
road--during his playing days--to scout a game between Chicago and
Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "Kyle Rote was one of the smartest football men of that era,"
former Giant quarterback Y.A. Tittle said. "He had a great offensive
mind regarding the passing game, and football in general. Plus the
fact, there has probably never been a nicer person to ever play the
game. Everybody liked Kyle Rote. Fans liked him, sportswriters liked
him, players liked him. He was just a good person and an outstanding
football player."</TE>
<TE>   Gifford said the Giants had "a lot of animosity" between their
offensive and defensive units, and Rote was the only player to bridge
that gap. "When he had something to say, it was important," Gifford
said.</TE>
<TE>   While a player, Rote spent his off-seasons as sports director at a
New York radio station. After his playing career ended, he went into
broadcasting and became one of NBC's most popular sportscasters in
the late 1960s and early '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "Every athlete that goes into broadcasting, guys like Pat
Summerall and Frank Gifford, owes him a debt of gratitude," Hall of
Fame linebacker Sam Huff said. "He really did the first locker room
report show by an athlete. Kyle Rote did that at Yankee Stadium. When
I was traded to Washington, I copied what he did and I still do a
locker room show for the Redskins."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Kyle Rote Jr., Rote is survived by his third wife, Nina,
and three other children from his first marriage: Gary, Chris and
Elizabeth. A wake will be held Tuesday at the Frank Campbell Funeral
Home in New York City. A private burial will be held at the National
Memorial Cemetery in Arlington, Va., either Wednesday or Thursday.</TE>

<LD>About 1,000 mountain bikes built by a Novato firm are being recalled
because the steering tube can break off the frame, causing riders to
lose control and fall.</LD>
<LD>   Marin Mountain Bikes received two reports of broken tubes, causing
injuries that included broken bones, broken teeth and cuts, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The frames are aluminum and will be replaced for free. Call the

<LD>A 16-year-old boy was arrested Thursday on suspicion of causing a
500-acre brush fire last weekend, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The boy, whose name was withheld, was arrested after investigators
gathered evidence and witness information, the Riverside unit of the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in a press
release.</LD>
<LD>   The so-called Bryant Fire started Sunday and destroyed private
property and threatened homes in the Calimesa, Cherry Valley and
Yucaipa areas. It was contained after four days by 1,300 firefighters
at a cost of more than $1.5 million. The boy's parents could be held
liable for the firefighting costs, the Forestry Department said.</LD>

<LD>One of four female staffers who alleged sexual harassment and
retaliation by corrections officers at the California Correctional
Center in Susanville will receive $400,000 from state officials to
settle the suit.</LD>
<LD>   More than $1.1 million in public money has been used in the last
two years to resolve the sexual harassment claims by the staffers.
The recent settlement will be paid to former Correctional Officer
Terri Sanchez. The three other staffers also settled their lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   Though Gov. Gray Davis' administration has been concerned about
the Lassen County prison for years, the assistant secretary of the
California Youth and Adult Correctional Agency said there have been
no sexual harassment complaints at the prison since Roy Castro took
over as warden in November 2000.</LD>

<HD>Trial Date Set for Mrs. Condit's Libel Suit</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has set a September 2003 trial date for Carolyn
Condit's $10-million libel suit against the National Enquirer.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Oliver W. Wanger said lawyers will meet May
14, 2003, to discuss whether the lawsuit can be settled out of court.
If not, the trial is slated for Sept. 30, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The wife of U.S. Rep. Gary Condit sued the tabloid in February
after it published headlines on its Web site and its Aug. 7, 2001,
front page that said: "Cops: Condit's Wife Attacked Chandra."</LD>
<TE>   Carolyn Condit said she never met slain intern Chandra Levy, and
Washington police have said the report was false. Levy's skeletal
remains were found May 22 in a Washington, D.C., park, and her death
was ruled a homicide.</TE>

<HD>Fuel Spill, Cleanup Close Part of Harbor Freeway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most of the lanes of the southbound Harbor Freeway were expected to
remain closed until early this morning, while workers mopped up as
much as 6,700 gallons of diesel fuel that spilled from an overturned
tanker truck Thursday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The 1 p.m. accident closed all southbound lanes from the Century
Freeway. Just after 6 p.m., the carpool and fast lanes were reopened.</LD>
<LD>   The accident is still under investigation, but authorities said
the tanker was trying to avoid two cars that had collided when one of
those vehicles struck the swerving truck, which then overturned.</LD>
<TE>   Three people were taken to Gardena Memorial Hospital with minor
injuries, including the truck driver, 38, and a passenger, 34. An
18-year-old woman in a car was slightly injured, California Highway
Patrol Officer Vince Ramirez said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the spilled fuel may have flowed into storm drains, said
L.A. Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis. The state Department of
Fish and Game and the Coast Guard were notified as a precaution.
Caltrans and other crews were expected to be working past midnight.</TE>
<TE>   The accident initially halted traffic for five miles, Ramirez said</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge mess," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kandace Warren, 31, said it took her 90 minutes to drive from Los
Angeles to Gardena.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like just getting out of the car and walking away, that's
how frustrated I was," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne Police Lt. John Beerling said commuters found their way
around surface streets.</TE>
<TE>   "When those things occur, usually everyone gets into a mad dash
scramble to get around the mess," Beerling said.</TE>
<TE>   "They scatter in numerous directions finding secret little
routes."</TE>

<HD>Neal Travis, 62; Journalist, N.Y. Gossip Columnist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neal Travis, a journalist best known for his stints as a gossip and
entertainment columnist for the New York Post, died Wednesday of
cancer. He was 62.</LD>
<LD>   Travis was the original editor of the Post's widely read "Page
Six" gossip column.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Otago, New Zealand, he dropped out of high school to work
for newspapers, first in his own country and then in Australia.</LD>
<TE>   Travis landed in New York in 1966 as a correspondent for the
Sydney Daily Mirror, the first of several Rupert Murdoch-owned papers
he would work for.</TE>
<TE>   He would eventually become known as one of "Rupert's Raiders," a
loyal group of columnists who followed the Australian media baron
from paper to paper.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Murdoch summoned him to the Post, where he proposed a
gossip column. "Page Six" became one of Manhattan's best-read
features, titillating readers with tidbits about Hollywood moguls and
other players.</TE>
<TE>   Travis unabashedly printed unsubstantiated rumors, once sighing to
a would-be critic: "Dear man, I'm writing a gossip column."</TE>
<TE>   Former Post publisher Ken Chandler said in that paper's obituary
that Travis "combined old-fashioned reporting, some commentary and an
occasional dose of speculation to make his column indispensable."</TE>
<TE>   Before coming to New York, Travis was editor of three
Murdoch-owned newspapers in Sydney. After leaving the Post in 1977,
he become editor of New York magazine's "Intelligencer" column.</TE>
<TE>   He served briefly as editor of the now-defunct California
magazine, leaving in 1991 to become an associate to the executive
producer of the syndicated tabloid news show "Hard Copy." He also
wrote several novels.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, he returned to the Post and launched the column named
after him, "Neal Travis' New York." It ran opposite "Page Six" and
offered such scoops as socialite Nina Griscom's romance with sugar
baron Pepe Fanjul, while taking potshots at Lizzie Grubman, the
publicist charged with backing her Mercedes into a crowd of
partygoers in the Hamptons.</TE>
<TE>   His last column appeared July 29.</TE>
<TE>   Travis is survived by his wife, Tolly; her three children, Sarah,
Anna and James; and a brother, Murray.</TE>

<HD>Judge Rejects Bid to Sequester Jurors</HD>
<DH>Trial: David Westerfield's attorney argues that panel will
fear finding him not guilty of Danielle van Dam's murder because of
public pressure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The judge in the David Westerfield trial Thursday turned down a
renewed request to sequester the jury by the lead defense attorney
who argued that the media are creating a "lynch-mob mentality" that
could influence jurors.</LD>
<LD>   With hundreds of journalists stationed outside the courthouse, the
jury spent its sixth day deliberating without reaching a decision.
Westerfield is charged with the kidnap and murder of 7-year-old
Danielle van Dam.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors on Thursday asked to review testimony from a police
criminalist. The criminalist testified that fibers found on
Danielle's body--including one in her necklace--matched fibers taken
from Westerfield's home and recreational vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Steven Feldman said he is concerned that jurors
will fear delivering a not-guilty verdict because they would be
hounded by the media and scorned by neighbors and co-workers. "We've
got to get the jury out of harm's way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge William Mudd said he believes that the
jurors will follow his oft-repeated admonition not to read or listen
to any accounts of the trial. He also rejected Feldman's request to
ban cameras from the court during the verdict and the penalty phase
if needed.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman singled out talk-show hosts from KFI-AM (640) in Los
Angeles who broadcast their show Monday from outside the courthouse.
The pair called jurors "broccoli" for not quickly convicting
Westerfield and gathered a crowd by handing out stems of the
vegetable.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose it's entertainment in L.A.," said Mudd. "I hope it
stays in L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Sequestering jurors--requiring them to live in a hotel and avoid
virtually all contact with their families as well as newspapers,
television and radio--is rarely done in the San Diego court system.
One reason is that sequestration led to considerable controversy in
the political corruption trial of then-Mayor Roger Hedgecock in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   After Hedgecock was convicted, his attorneys claimed that the
bailiff who was sent to supervise the jurors improperly influenced
them by supplying legal definitions. A photograph showed the jurors
drinking, and there were indications that being together in the hotel
led to friction and animosity among them.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he was deciding not to ban cameras, Mudd continued to
express annoyance at the media. He said his clerk and bailiff will no
longer answer questions from reporters. "We're not here for you,
believe it or not," Mudd told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd and the media have had several clashes, including
disagreements over the judge's decision to seal documents and hold
closed hearings and to oust a producer for a San Diego radio talk
show that broadcast information from a closed hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Mudd has got to come into the 21st century," said Dean

<HD>Teen Accuses Stepfather of Sexual Abuse</HD>
<DH>Trial: Co-defendant in attempted murder case testifies that
alleged advances occurred when she was 12 or 13.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jennifer Childs, an aspiring Simi Valley pop singer charged with
trying to kill her stepfather, testified Thursday that her stepfather
touched her breasts and kissed her during a vacation several years
ago in Washington, D.C.</LD>
<LD>   Childs, 19, is charged along with her mother, Eileen Childs, 37,
with arson and attempted murder for allegedly setting fire to Larry
Childs' bed and then using a baseball bat to repeatedly hit him
inside the family's home in March.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities believe the women were motivated by Larry Childs' life
insurance policy, which they say is worth more than $1.4 million.
Larry Childs, 57, survived and is in the process of divorcing Eileen
Childs.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always been scared of my dad," Childs said of her stepfather
during questioning by her attorney, Jean Farley.</TE>
<TE>   After spending Wednesday telling jurors her stepfather was wildly
moody and violent, Jennifer Childs testified Thursday for the first
time that Larry Childs had made sexual advances toward her.</TE>
<TE>   The teenager said she and her stepfather took a vacation together
when she was 12 or 13, so she could see the White House. The trip
lasted one or two weeks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   During the trip, Jennifer Childs said, her stepfather would ask
her every night to take her clothes off but that she repeatedly
rebuffed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I think after that he was always mad at me since I kept saying
'no' [during that trip]," she testified.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Childs told jurors she never revealed the assault to her
mother, citing fears of what would become of the family and because
she "didn't want to be the one to ruin everything."</TE>
<TE>   "He told me it was a father-daughter secret," she testified of her
stepfather's warning to her at the time of the alleged abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime after the trip, however, Jennifer Childs, known in the
pop singing world as Jenni Childs, told two friends.</TE>
<TE>   Ma'rya Mahome testified Thursday that Jennifer Childs told her of
the alleged sexual abuse two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony on the alleged abuse is significant because defense
attorneys want to show jurors that Jennifer and Eileen Childs were
the victims during the predawn incident on March 25.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants, both of whom remain in custody pending the outcome
of the trial, contend they were acting in self-defense when Larry
Childs awoke in his burning bed, left his bedroom and then allegedly
attacked the pair in a hallway.</TE>
<TE>   In earlier testimony, Larry Childs denied attacking his family or
sexually abusing his stepdaughter.</TE>
<TE>   During questioning by prosecutor Lisa Lee earlier Thursday,
Jennifer Childs testified that her stepfather was screaming "Help
me!" "Oh my God!" and "Fire!" after fleeing his bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   The trial will resume this morning, with Eileen Childs expected to
take the stand.</TE>

<HD>Boxer Alleges Nuclear Waste Sent to Dumps</HD>
<DH>Health: Rocketdyne insists that only safe materials went to
two county landfills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radioactive material from a former nuclear test facility has been
dumped at two Los Angeles County landfills that lack appropriate
safeguards to protect the health and safety of neighbors, U.S. Sen.
Barbara Boxer said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But officials at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory near
Chatsworth flatly reject those assertions, saying that the company
has never dumped radioactive waste at local landfills.</LD>
<LD>   The California Democrat said radioactive material from the hilltop
lab has been shipped to the Calabasas Landfill and to the Sunshine
Canyon Landfill in Granada Hills as part of an ongoing federal
cleanup effort. The Department of Energy has acknowledged that waste
with a level of radioactivity deemed safe for general disposal was
sent to the Bradley Landfill in Sun Valley, Boxer said.</LD>
<TE>   "These landfills, often situated near neighborhoods and without
sophisticated monitoring systems, are not suitable for disposal sites
for radioactive materials," Boxer said. "Radioactive waste collected
from highly contaminated sites must not be handled like the trash
collected from our kitchens."</TE>
<TE>   The senator said she learned that radioactive waste had been
dumped in Calabasas and Granada Hills from Secretary of Energy
Spencer Abraham in his response to her letter requesting information
about Rocketdyne's radioactive waste disposal process. In the letter,
dated June 28, Abraham said that soil and debris from the Rocketdyne
lab are shipped off-site for disposal.</TE>
<TE>   Radioactive materials with levels above the federal and state
safety standards are shipped to facilities in Utah, Nevada or
Washington, the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   If the material's level of radioactivity is below federal and
state standards, it is disposed of at local sanitary or hazardous
waste landfills, according to Abraham's letter.</TE>
<TE>   Soil and debris, as well as trash from the lab's office areas,
have been shipped to the Bradley, Calabasas and Sunshine landfills,
Abraham said, adding: "The level of radioactivity is so low, the
equivalent of about two chest X-rays, that disposal in these types of
landfills is protective of public health and the environment."</TE>
<TE>   Boxer maintains, however, that any level of radiation is too much,
said spokesman David Sandretti.</TE>
<TE>   "Radioactive waste should be disposed of in a proper setting, and
a local landfill is not a proper setting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rocketdyne officials don't dispute that the waste went to the
landfills, but they insist it wasn't radioactive or dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "Any cleanup at the site has met all release criteria--only normal
trash from office areas has been sent to the three landfills," said
Steve Lafflam, Rocketdyne's division director for safety, health and
environmental affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Lafflam said Rocketdyne takes public health issues seriously and
would not do anything to violate its trust with the community, but
that "a few individuals with a broader agenda want to use Santa
Susana as a pivot point for a national debate" on environmental
regulatory issues.</TE>

<HD>Dave Williams, 30; Charismatic Lead Singer of Rock Band
Drowning Pool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Williams, the lead singer of the up-and-coming rock band
Drowning Pool, was found dead Wednesday in the group's tour bus in
Manassas, Va. An investigation was underway Thursday into the cause.
He was 30.</LD>
<LD>   Williams and his bandmates in the Dallas quartet were on the
Ozzfest tour, a popular traveling festival of hard-rock groups that
last year helped propel Drowning Pool to success. Its debut album,
"Sinner," has sold 1.2 million copies since its release in June 2001.
The group's biggest hit, "Bodies," has enjoyed great radio exposure
and exemplifies the band's sound, which is darkly ominous in lyrics
and aggressive in performance.</LD>
<LD>   The death of the charismatic frontman -- his nickname, "Stage,"
was a nod to his performance presence--leaves the band's future
uncertain. The Ozzfest tour, which visits the Glen Helen Blockbuster
Pavilion on Aug. 31, will continue, but it was not clear Thursday
whether the remaining members of the group will participate.</LD>
<TE>   Drummer Mike Luce, bassist Stevie Benton and guitarist C.J. Pierce
had been a band for several years in eastern Texas before tapping
Williams, who grew up in Dallas, as lead singer and beginning their
ascent. The band had gone from a minor player at the start of Ozzfest
last year to, by the end, a periodic main-stage performer. On this
year's edition of the tour, which also includes Ozzy Osbourne, Rob
Zombie and P.O.D., the band was clearly a fan favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was described by friends as a kind soul with a Texas
drawl and love of heavy music. Tattooed, pierced and beefy, he was an
intense-looking figure on-and offstage. He expressed his music
genre's requisite iconoclastic streak with his favorite T-shirt that
read "Worship Satan and Smoke Crack" and with lyrics that taunted
organized religion--a nod, he told interviewers, to his childhood in
Dallas, when his family's pious expression caused him to chafe.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Revolver magazine, Williams said that as a
youngster he idolized David Lee Roth and Vince Neil, two rock figures
famous for showmanship and living the rock party life.</TE>
<TE>   "All Dave really wanted to do in this life was to be in a
platinum-selling band and tour the world, but not because he wanted
to be the rock star," said John Connolly, a close friend and a member
of the band Sevendust. "He [wanted it because he] got to hang out
with the people he considered his heroes and in turn became one of
the best frontmen I've ever seen."</TE>

<HD>India's Remote Northeast Devastated by Flooding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAHORIGHAT, India</DL>
<LD>The flooded Brahmaputra River has cut a vicious swath through India's
remote northeast, killing hundreds of people, leveling homes, washing
away schools and leaving millions of people homeless.</LD>
<LD>   Arun Kalita's village, Sootea, in Assam state, was swept away, and
he and his wife and four children now live in a tarpaulin-roofed
riverbank shelter, depending on government handouts to stave off
their hunger.</LD>
<LD>   "We just kept watching from a distance and could do nothing," said
Kalita, 57, his voice choked with emotion.</LD>
<TE>   But Kalita is one of the lucky ones--he and his family survived.
Annual monsoon flooding has killed more than 900 people in India,
Bangladesh and Nepal since June and displaced or surrounded about 25
million more.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most isolated victims are here in Assam, along the
rugged foothills of the Himalayas.</TE>
<TE>   After two weeks of destruction, the rains have slowed and the
flood waters have started receding in much of the province. But the
monsoon-driven weather remains unpredictable.</TE>
<TE>   In all, monsoon floods have killed at least 323 people in India,
according to official estimates. In neighboring Bangladesh, 157 have
died.</TE>
<TE>   The highest death toll has been in the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal,
where at least 424 people have either been swept away by flood waters
or crushed under mudslides in remote mountain villages.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same story for thousands of villages along the
Brahmaputra, which originates in China's Tibet region as the Yarlung,
flows down nearly 500 miles across the Assam plains and into
Bangladesh before spilling into the Bay of Bengal.</TE>
<TE>   Flooding and landslides triggered by heavy rains also have killed
108 people over the last 10 days in the southeastern Chinese province
of Hunan, the official News China News Agency said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Rains that started Aug. 5 have wrecked railways and highways in
Hunan, a densely populated farming area, it said.</TE>

the allegedly blasphemous statements but instead was a victim of a
neighbor's plot to steal his land in Punjab province, Associated
Press of Pakistan reported.</LD>
<LD>   Masih had been accused of expressing support for "The Satanic

<LD>Australian researchers said an air-breathing "scramjet" engine had
successfully achieved supersonic ignition in the atmosphere for the
first time, reaching 7.6 times the speed of sound.</LD>
<LD>   Project leader Allan Paull said data analyzed from the July 30
test showed the engine, which uses oxygen in the atmosphere to ignite
hydrogen fuel, had reached Mach 7.6--a speed that would allow travel
from London to Sydney in two hours instead of more than 20.</LD>
<LD>   The test over the central Australian desert marked the first time
engineers made the supersonic engine work outside an air tunnel.</LD>

<HD>Protesters Found Guilty in Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>Asia: Debate follows the conviction of 16 Falun Gong
members on charges of obstruction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>The trial's main allegation was hardly earthshaking: obstruction of a
public sidewalk.</LD>
<LD>   Those in the dock were protesters with forgettable names and no
prior records. They constitute a group so small that they hadn't even
required a police permit to gather and had taken up only a fraction
of a little-used 36-foot-wide sidewalk, one of the widest in Hong
Kong.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the trial that ended in a Hong Kong courtroom Thursday with
the conviction and fining of all 16 defendants still packed in a
crowd. It had dragged on for 26 days and was handled by a senior
government prosecutor.</LD>
<TE>   The reason for all the attention: The demonstrators were members
of Falun Gong, a spiritual movement for which Chinese President Jiang
Zemin appears to have developed an intense and deeply personal
loathing. And the bit of sidewalk they chose for their March 14
protest was in front of the Beijing government's liaison office in
Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   The result was Hong Kong's first criminal trial involving Falun
Gong practitioners, clearly a sensitive issue for authorities here.
The officials administer the former British colony as a
quasi-autonomous special administrative region of China with greater
human rights and more political freedom than the mainland. But
authorities in Hong Kong have shown themselves at times almost
desperate to please the central government in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   Falun Gong has been branded as an evil cult and outlawed elsewhere
in China, but followers are free to practice in Hong Kong. Although
they meet openly in parks, they also have undergone sporadic
harassment and tend to be penned in whenever Jiang visits the region.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, in a carefully worded verdict that took more than two
hours to read, Magistrate Symon Wong underscored the rights of
assembly and freedom of expression that are guaranteed under Hong
Kong's Basic Law.</TE>
<TE>   "These are long-standing rights that the court will ensure will be
respected, preserved and protected," he said. But Wong added that
"those rights are not absolute."</TE>
<TE>   He declared all 16 defendants guilty of causing an obstruction. He
also found that nine had committed the more serious offense of
obstructing the police, who broke up the protest. Three were
convicted of assaulting a police officer. None of the defendants was
jailed; instead, they received fines ranging from $167 to $487.</TE>
<TE>   Falun Gong supporters and human rights advocates quickly denounced
the ruling as a threat to freedom in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   "How can we tell the world we're a free society?" asked Law
Yuk-kai, director of the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor, an
independent watchdog group. Hong Kong officials "don't care about
rights or protecting the public. They are protecting the egos of
mainland leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Falun Gong spokeswoman Sophie Xiao said the group planned to meet
with lawyers later today to discuss a possible appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Four of those convicted are Swiss, one is from New Zealand, and
the rest are Hong Kong Chinese. They sat quietly in the courtroom as
the verdict was read--first in English, then in Cantonese, Mandarin
and German.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not obstruction, it's persecution," said Leeshei Lemish,
a Falun Gong practitioner who traveled from California to lend moral
support to the defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Others disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We should respect the verdict," declared Ma Lik, a prominent
local pro-Beijing political figure and a member of the National
People's Congress, China's assembly.</TE>
<TE>   "According to the law, everyone has the freedom to express their
opinions but their action cannot obstruct other people."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, all but a narrow stretch of the sidewalk in question
had been roped off and torn up for improvement Thursday. The space
available for pedestrians to pass the construction site was smaller
than what was left by the demonstrators in March.</TE>

<HD>Japan Marks WWII Surrender</HD>
<DH>Asia: Prime minister avoids paying tribute at a
controversial shrine on anniversary, although several conservative
lawmakers visit the site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>In a conciliatory gesture to Japan's Asian neighbors, Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi did not visit a controversial war shrine Thursday
as the nation marked the 57th anniversary of its surrender in World
War II.</LD>
<LD>   But as Koizumi expressed regrets about Japan's aggression,
conservative lawmakers, including five Cabinet ministers and Tokyo's
right-wing governor, still paid their respects at the capital's
Yasukuni shrine.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 2.5 million war dead, including executed war criminals, are
honored at the shrine.</LD>
<TE>   Koizumi sparked outrage last year, particularly in China and South
Korea, when he made a surprise visit days before the surrender
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Koizumi observed a moment of silence and placed flowers
at a nearby cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi and Emperor Akihito later attended a staid commemorative
ceremony traditionally held at a cavernous martial arts hall outside
the stone-lined moats of the Imperial Palace.</TE>
<TE>   "During the war, our country inflicted great damage and pain to
the people of many countries, especially in Asia," Koizumi said. "As
the representative of this nation's people, I again reflect deeply
and express humble condolences to those who lost their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi also pledged to uphold Japan's pacifist constitution and
foster better relations with its Asian neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Akihito, dressed in a black tuxedo with tails, and Empress Michiko
then bowed in reverence before a vast wall of yellow and white
chrysanthemums.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel a new deep sadness thinking of those countless people who
lost their precious lives and their surviving families," Akihito
said. "I pray for world peace and the further prosperity of this
country."</TE>
<TE>   To many in China and South Korea, official shrine visits by
Japanese lawmakers are a sign that Japan glorifies its militarist era
and refuses to atone for wartime atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   China criticized Japan again Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Japanese side should take concrete action to observe honestly
and face squarely its history," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Kong Quan was quoted as saying by the official New China News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The issue was apparent earlier in the day when a controversial
history textbook was adopted for the first time for use in junior
high schools.</TE>
<TE>   The books, introduced last year amid protests from Seoul and
Beijing, are attacked by critics for allegedly whitewashing Japanese
wartime atrocities.</TE>

<HD>Bin Laden Linked to Masoud's Death</HD>
<DH>Assassination: A former Taliban official says the Al Qaeda
leader ordered the slaying of the Northern Alliance military chief.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Osama bin Laden personally ordered the assassination of Afghan
opposition leader Ahmed Shah Masoud days before the Sept. 11 attacks,
a former senior Taliban official said. It was the first time a
Taliban insider has discussed the terrorist mastermind's role
publicly.</LD>
<LD>   Masoud, military chief of the Northern Alliance, was mortally
wounded Sept. 9 when two suicide attackers posing as television
journalists detonated a bomb during an interview in Khodja Bahauddin,
in Takhar province near the Tajik border.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview, Mullah Mohammed Khaksar, former Taliban deputy
interior minister, said Bin Laden had ordered two suicide bombers
diverted from a trip to Indonesia and sent them on the mission.</LD>
<TE>   Khaksar said that on Sept. 9 he had gone to the home of Taliban
Interior Minister Abdul Razzak to pay respects for the death of
Razzak's father. Razzak, who has eluded capture by the U.S.-led
coalition, had contacts with Bin Laden, and two Saudis that Khaksar
believed to be Al Qaeda members were at the wake.</TE>
<TE>   Khaksar said the two Saudis, whom he did not identify, told him of
Bin Laden's role and assured him that Masoud was dead, although the
Northern Alliance would withhold confirmation of his death for 48
hours until a successor was chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "They said, 'No, believe me he is gone,' " Khaksar said, referring
to Masoud. "They also said that he was killed by two Arabs who were
supposed to go to Indonesia but were ordered to go to Masoud and kill
him. The order came from Osama. He canceled their trip to Indonesia."</TE>
<TE>   The United States has said it believes that Bin Laden had
foreknowledge of the plot to kill Masoud, but has not said what level
of involvement he had.</TE>
<TE>   The assassins were traveling on Belgian passports, and in January
police in Paris arrested two men on suspicion of providing false
documents to Masoud's killers.</TE>
<TE>   The French authorities believed that the passports used by
Masoud's killers were stolen from the Belgian Consulate in
Strasbourg, France, or the Belgian Embassy in The Hague.</TE>
<TE>   There has been wide speculation that Bin Laden may have plotted
Masoud's death to ingratiate himself further with Taliban leader
Mullah Mohammed Omar to ensure his protection if the Americans
retaliated for the attacks he knew were only days away in the United
States.</TE>

<HD>Death of Palestinian Teenager Is Denounced</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The Israeli army used the victim as a 'human
shield,' a rights group alleges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An Israeli human rights group protested the shooting death of a
Palestinian teenager in a northern West Bank village, saying Thursday
that he was used as a "human shield" by soldiers who sent him to warn
a Hamas leader to surrender.</LD>
<LD>   Nineteen-year-old Nidal Daraghmeh was shot as he approached the
house of Hamas militant Nasser Jerar, a wheelchair user who was later
crushed to death when Israeli soldiers bulldozed his house.</LD>
<LD>   Hamas spokesman Abdulaziz Rantisi said Jerar's death late
Wednesday "will not pass without strong punishment."</LD>
<TE>   In a statement, the military said Jerar had continued his Hamas
activities despite losing both arms and a leg while trying to plant a
bomb in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The military also said Jerar recruited suicide bombers and was
planning a bombing aimed at bringing down an unidentified high-rise
building in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Before demolishing the house in the village of Tubas, the military
gave Daraghmeh, a local resident, a bulletproof vest and ordered him
to go to Jerar's residence and tell the 44-year-old militant to
surrender, the army and Palestinian witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   But as Daraghmeh approached the house, he was hit by gunfire.
Palestinians charged that Israeli gunfire killed him, while the army
said that he was hit by shots from inside the house.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem charged that soldiers used
Daraghmeh as a "human shield." The army said it was trying to prevent
civilian deaths by having Daraghmeh warn anyone who may have been in
the house with Jerar.</TE>
<TE>   Amid continuing violence Thursday, an Israeli tank advancing to
the edge of the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip killed a
5-year-old Palestinian boy, Palestinian security sources and hospital
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   They said two Palestinian men were wounded when they tried to help
the boy, Ayman Fares, who was lying outside his house in the densely
populated area.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian security source said the tank opened fire "without
reason." But an Israeli army spokesman said gunmen fired on Israeli
forces, who returned fire and injured one of the men. The army said
it had no information about the shooting of a boy.</TE>
<TE>   The camp abuts a Jewish settlement guarded by Israeli troops, and
the area is prone to violence linked to the 22-month Palestinian
uprising.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army said it shot and killed
two armed Palestinians carrying a large bag north of the Israeli
crossing of Kissufim. The men had a bomb, the army said.</TE>

<HD>Jailed Egyptian Activist Gains Wider Support</HD>
<DH>Policy: The U.S. has signaled that it won't give Cairo
additional aid. Saad Eddin Ibrahim's case has reverberated in the
rights community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Barbara Ibrahim's phone is ringing constantly, but these days it's
not with the death threats against her husband or the family that
used to come as often as 10 times a night. These are calls of
support.</LD>
<LD>   Her husband, Saad Eddin Ibrahim, has become Egypt's most prominent
democracy activist, a stature acquired because the authorities have
put the 63-year-old in prison--for seven years of hard labor.</LD>
<LD>   His crimes: defaming Egypt and using a grant from the European
Union to monitor parliamentary elections. He also spoke up for the
rights of this nation's Coptic Christian minority.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush plans to notify Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
that he will oppose any additional U.S. financial aid this year for
Egypt because of the case, administration sources said privately. The
decision won't reduce the nearly $2 billion a year in aid the U.S.
provides Egypt under the 1979 Camp David peace accords.</TE>
<TE>   While declining to publicly connect the issue of aid with the
Ibrahim case, White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan said Thursday
that the U.S. government "has expressed its deep concerns about this
particular case" to Egyptian officials and that "at this time we
don't contemplate additional funds beyond the Camp David
commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Bush administration's decision does not cut existing
aid, the gesture--Washington's first in this case--was taken by many
here as a sign that momentum is building to help win freedom for the
activist, who has both U.S. and Egyptian citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Calls From Media</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Barbara Ibrahim asked a radio interviewer for 25
minutes to compose herself and collect her thoughts. "I don't want to
make things worse," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine that she could. Her husband, who has a
neurological disorder, sits in Tora prison and faces the prospect of
spending what could be his final years behind bars. Egypt says the
case is not political, that Saad Eddin Ibrahim placed himself above
the law and was convicted after a trial. (The case was tried in a
state security court, which restricts the grounds he can cite in his
expected appeal.) Officials said they will not be pressured to
release him.</TE>
<TE>   "Egypt does not accept pressure and will not bow to pressure and
everyone knows that," Foreign Minister Ahmed Maher said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Case Has Wider Effect</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the case extends beyond the activist's fate: The
goal of Mubarak's authoritarian regime may have been to lock up one
man, but the result has been to send a chill through the human rights
community here.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you ask me to comment on this?" asked one of Cairo's most
active human rights leaders. "As you can understand, this is a very,
very sensitive situation and it's difficult for people in my position
to say much."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Ibrahim's legal case is an example of the very problems
in Egypt that the imprisoned activist is fighting to correct.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Ibrahim, who was born and raised in the Midwest and met
her future husband at DePauw University in Indiana, was in the
courtroom July 29 at what was expected to be a routine hearing in the
retrial of her husband and other defendants. Instead, the judge
walked in and simply read the verdicts. The last defense attorney had
only just spoken, and Ibrahim had not been given a chance to submit
his written statement, which the judge had said would be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   He was dragged off to prison, and Barbara Ibrahim told reporters:
"The rule of law died today in Egypt."</TE>
<TE>   But with Washington's decision, and the growing interest in her
husband's cause, she's feeling a bit better now.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no deep resentment of the place but a sort of bewilderment
of who is behind it," said Barbara Ibrahim, who has lived in Egypt
since 1975 and works as the regional director for the National
Population Council. "It doesn't add up around any logic other than
keeping a society off balance--to serve the purpose of general
intimidation so that no one feels safe."</TE>
<TE>   Egypt had lobbied Washington for an additional $130 million this
year after Congress voted to give Israel $200 million in
anti-terrorism funds as part of a $5-billion spending bill. However,
the new aid for Israel is now on hold after Bush said this week that
he will not sign the bill. Theoretically, Congress can restore the
funding to Israel in another bill.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union and human rights groups worldwide had long
condemned Egypt for its conduct in the Ibrahim case, but the
criticism of the nation's human rights record is much broader. Egypt
has been accused of using emergency power not only to stamp out
Islamic extremists but also to silence all dissenting voices in civil
society.</TE>
<TE>   Until the decision on aid, the U.S. had remained largely silent
concerning such charges against Egypt, which it considers to be a
crucial player in regional stability and the post-Sept. 11 war
against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a signal, and the Egyptians will have to read a strong
message into it that [human rights violations] do cost," said a
senior Bush administration official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity. "This case is important."</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim was a professor of sociology at American University in
Cairo and served as the director of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for
Social Development Studies. In May 2001 he was convicted on charges
that stemmed largely from his work monitoring elections and
documenting the status of Coptic Christians in Egypt. The court also
convicted 27 other employees of the center for aiding and abetting
Ibrahim in the alleged activities, though not all received prison
time.</TE>
<TE>   The convictions were overturned by an appeals court and a new
trial was ordered.</TE>
<TE>   At his first trial, the court refused to allow Ibrahim and his
defense team to see the evidence the prosecution claimed to have. The
three-judge panel convicted him after 90 minutes of deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Ibrahim was shocked at her husband's imprisonment, but not
entirely surprised: For many years, there had been a drumbeat against
him.</TE>
<TE>   The vitriol began in 1994 when he played host to a meeting on
minorities in the Arab world and discussed the issue of the Copts, a
religious denomination to which he doesn't belong.</TE>
<TE>   That led to widespread attacks against him in the
government-controlled media. Then he was castigated publicly for
talking with Israeli peace groups that opposed the occupation of the
Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   A Slew of Death Threats</TE>
<TE>   But the death threats didn't start until February 2000. Night
after night, men would call, saying they were Islamic militants and
would kill the whole family because of Ibrahim's support for the
Copts. The harassers stopped as soon as the Ibrahims installed
"caller ID," making Barbara wonder how the culprits knew about the
move--and exactly who was behind the calls.</TE>
<TE>   Then in May 2000, an employee of his center called to say the
police had broken in at night.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember, I was in bed, and Saad said [on the telephone],
'Well, I don't have anything to hide. Maybe it's a good thing.' "</TE>
<TE>   One month later, their house was surrounded by armed troopers and
he was taken away at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Robin Wright in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Proposes Partial Thaw of Terror Suspects' Assets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>In a move aimed at making life easier for more than 200 people
allegedly linked to Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, the
United States has proposed partially lifting a freeze of financial
assets to allow them to pay for food, rent and other living expenses.</LD>
<LD>   A draft resolution circulated to the 15-member U.N. Security
Council would authorize the country where the individuals live to
determine the amount of money that can be released.</LD>
<LD>   The council in January shifted sanctions from the government of
Afghanistan to Bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and the nation's
former Taliban rulers.</LD>
<TE>   It ordered all nations to impose a travel ban and arms embargo and
freeze the assets of individuals and groups on a list compiled by a
council committee monitoring the sanctions. The latest list, issued
May 22, includes more than 200 individuals in more than a dozen
countries and more than 60 banks, companies, organizations and other
entities.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. draft resolution is a response to complaints from some
individuals on the list and their governments that the January
resolution was making people subject to sanctions destitute because
it did not make sufficient provisions for living expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed U.S. "technical amendment" would allow the countries
where individuals on the list live to determine the amount of money
necessary for basic expenses, "including payments for foodstuffs,
rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance
premiums and public utility charges." The funds would then be
released. Funds could also be unfrozen to pay for some legal fees and
service charges.</TE>
<TE>   The United States is expected to formally introduce the resolution
to the council next week.</TE>

<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>A former police chief and five army and police officers were
acquitted Thursday of responsibility for the massacre of civilians in
East Timor three years ago as the territory sought to secede from
Indonesia.</LD>
<LD>   The verdicts, handed down in two courts here in the Indonesian
capital, appalled human rights activists and called into question the
ability of the nation's special human rights court to punish
officials responsible for the military-backed mayhem that cost at
least 1,000 lives.</LD>
<LD>   "The trials were seriously flawed, have not been performed in
accordance with international standards and have delivered neither
truth nor justice," said a joint statement issued by Amnesty
International and the Judicial System Monitoring Program, an East
Timor-based group that observed the trials.</LD>
<TE>   The six defendants, including former East Timor Police Chief
Timbul Silaen, were among 18 officers and civilians charged with
crimes against humanity.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank God that the judge has made the right decision and
acknowledged that policemen were not involved in the violation of
human rights," Silaen said after the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   The only defendant convicted so far is former East Timor Gov. Jose
Abilio Soares, who was found guilty Wednesday of crimes against
humanity and sentenced to three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The court concluded that he failed to prevent killings carried out
by pro-government militia gangs opposed to independence for the
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Rights activists say that top officials responsible for many of
the killings were never indicted and that prosecutors did not present
evidence in court of the military's role in organizing the gangs.</TE>
<TE>   East Timor was forcibly annexed in 1976 by the government of
Indonesian strongman Suharto. After he stepped down in 1998, the
Indonesian government agreed to let East Timor hold a referendum on
Aug. 30, 1999, to decide the territory's fate.</TE>
<TE>   The army, which opposed independence, organized the militias to
intimidate the East Timorese. After nearly 80% of the voters cast
their ballots for secession, the militias ran amok, slaughtering
civilians, destroying thousands of buildings and sending 260,000
refugees fleeing across the border into West Timor, which remains a
province of Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   Placed under United Nations protection, East Timor became
independent in May.</TE>
<TE>   In one courtroom Thursday, Silaen was acquitted of charges that he
allowed his officers to take part in atrocities and failed to stop
militia members from killing civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, another court acquitted two army colonels, an army
major and a police major and a retired army colonel. "The defendants
have not been proved guilty and therefore should be acquitted of all
charges," Judge Cicut Sutiarso told the court.</TE>
<TE>   After the acquittals, human rights activists renewed calls for the
U.N. to establish an independent human rights tribunal to bring
perpetrators of the killings to justice.</TE>
<TE>   "The crimes committed in East Timor during 1999 were of such a
serious nature that they cannot go unpunished, but the prospect of
Indonesia being able to fulfill its responsibility to deliver a
credible and effective justice process is now remote," Amnesty
International and the monitoring group said.</TE>
<TE>   The rights groups said the prosecution did not present evidence
that reflected "the widespread and systematic nature" of the crimes
and failed to address the role of the Indonesian security forces in
setting up and supporting the militias.</TE>
<TE>   "Key evidence regarding the direct involvement of the Indonesian
security forces in committing serious crimes was not presented to the
court," the groups said.</TE>
<TE>   The trials were also hampered because victims and witnesses in
East Timor were not promised what they considered to be adequate
protection and refused to travel to Indonesia to testify.</TE>

<HD>Years of German Effort Wash Away</HD>
<DH>Europe: Floods wreak havoc on multimillion- dollar projects
in the formerly Communist states. Death toll on the continent tops
100.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DRESDEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>As the raging Elbe River spread its waters ever wider through this
restored eastern city Thursday, residents and officials watched in
dumbstruck horror as the billions invested here since the nation's
1990 reunification were washed away.</LD>
<LD>   Debris-clogged water gushed from the windows and doors of the
sleek new train station, a pet project in the federal government's
more than $1-trillion renovation of the former Communist states in
eastern Germany. Lovingly repaired baroque palaces transformed into
hotels, museums and public offices are unusable, their basements
flooded and electrical systems ruined. Hundreds of shops, restaurants
and services have shut down in what should be the height of the
tourist season, with sandbags blocking entrances and mud covering the
floors.</LD>
<LD>   The human toll of the past week's catastrophic flooding across
Central Europe amid torrential rain also continued to climb, with
more than 100 lives now lost to drowning, accidents and failed rescue
missions and hundreds of thousands of people forced to abandon their
homes.</LD>
<TE>   About 40,000 Germans prepared to evacuate downstream as far as
Magdeburg, 120 miles northwest of Dresden, in anticipation of
inundation. They included the entire 16,000 population of Bitterfeld,
where a massive chemical industry complex was at risk of flooding
after the Elbe broke through a dam.</TE>
<TE>   Boats that were torn from their riverside moorings in the
neighboring Czech Republic had to be blown up so they would sink
before being carried downstream to Dresden, where they could have
wiped out multimillion-dollar bridges. One Czech was killed when he
was struck by flying debris from the explosions. In the Austrian town
of Schwertberg, river-borne refuse being carried by the raging Danube
tore through part of a 100-foot-long steel bridge.</TE>
<TE>   It is the economic devastation visited on the millions of
survivors that is increasingly drawing attention and dread.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany alone, 20,000 houses have been destroyed and many more
damaged. Most of the country's grain and potato crops have been
ruined; the national farmers association estimated that will mean at
least $1.5 billion in losses.</TE>
<TE>   Roads have been washed away, isolating towns such as the
watchmaking enclave of Glashuette, which was one of the few economic
bright spots in Saxony state.</TE>
<TE>   Work Was Undone</TE>
<TE>   Though no accurate estimate of the damage can be made until the
waters recede, officials are already casting the disaster as one of
unparalleled peacetime proportions. More than 4 million Germans have
lost property or income.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're basically facing is a whole new start in rebuilding
the east. We have to say it that simply," Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder told journalists in Berlin after touring the areas along
the Elbe.</TE>
<TE>   Dresden, the capital of Saxony, was the least economically
depressed part of formerly Communist eastern Germany, which has
struggled since reunification. The city's relative prosperity was due
largely to the generous investment of billions of dollars in taxpayer
money to create the infrastructure and services needed to attract big
industrial investment.</TE>
<TE>   The costly building boom that began a dozen years ago helped bring
new jobs to the state--at the AMD computer chip plant near Meissen,
new Siemens and Motorola operations, and a Toyota production plant
for air conditioning and electronics near Senftenberg. Those
investments survived the flooding, but the railway damage could
disrupt shipping.</TE>
<TE>   The cultural offerings of Dresden that made Saxony an attractive
choice for business will take months, if not years, to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling even before the flooding with 16% unemployment, Saxony
is likely to suffer a further blow if, as expected, patrons abandon
the damaged businesses in Dresden.</TE>
<TE>   "The shop is OK, but the cellar is full of water and the whole
air-conditioning and heating system is kaput," said Regina Zeglin,
whose Wempe jewelry shop was one of the few businesses open in the
city's historic Old Town. "We've been luckier than most, but it's
still going to mean considerable losses for us. Our turnover depends
a lot on the tourists, and they won't be coming anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Beautician Cathrin Below was at her Figaro salon to clean up and
secure the premises against looters, who have struck a number of
businesses. "We'll probably go broke after this," she said with more
resignation than fear.</TE>
<TE>   The Dresden station of the Deutsche Bahn railway network was
probably the most costly and significant investment made here in the
massive building boom aimed at upgrading Communist-era
infrastructure. Not only have the flood waters claimed its cavernous
lobby and adjacent shopping center, but hundreds of rail cars also
stand in mucky water up to their windows. A Deutsche Bahn spokesman
estimated the damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Hilton Hotel, another post-reunification project, was closed
and evacuated as the river intruded.</TE>
<TE>   A nearby underground parking garage, built with federal
development funds, is among the flooded facilities yet to be assessed
for permanent damage.</TE>
<TE>   As the Elbe surged beneath Dresden's stately stone bridges, its
savaged booty traveled with it: uprooted trees, trash bins, doors,
garden sheds, even a lunch wagon.</TE>
<TE>   Already in a Slump</TE>
<TE>   Germany was already in the grip of economic stagnation and
struggling with 10% unemployment when the floods struck, but some
economists say the damaged cities and ruined crops won't be economic
deathblows.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be massive new reconstruction, and that can be a
stimulation for the economy," said Gustav Horn, a top official with
the German Institute for Economic Research, but he added that
insurance and government assistance will take a heavy toll on public
coffers.</TE>
<TE>   Saxony Gov. Georg Milbradt acknowledged that the losses are
staggering for his state and that the bulk of the damage is to newly
built or extensively renovated structures that were considered
priorities in the post-reunification spending spree.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't say everything has been washed away that was built over
the past 12 years, but it has certainly been a significant loss," he
told reporters at the restored baroque palace that is his government
headquarters. "I don't know how many billions has been invested in
Dresden, but I know there was $100 million spent on this building
alone."</TE>
<TE>   Dresden has a history of resilience, however. It was flattened by
Allied bombing toward the end of World War II, leaving a landscape of
rubble and hardly a significant structure standing. Communist
planners hastily threw up prefabricated apartments after the war to
house the homeless masses, and it was only after 1990 that the city
recovered its imperial splendor.</TE>
<TE>   Other Eastern European areas hit by the floods are in the same
economically precarious position. Prague, the Czech capital that is a
treasure trove of medieval architecture, had suffered at least $2
billion in damage before the waters began receding Wednesday.
Slovakia's capital, Bratislava, also was under threat as rains
resumed in Russia and Romania. In Austria, at least 10,000 homes were
rendered uninhabitable.</TE>
<TE>   Even the Czech Republic's famous breweries were hurt. The
Budejovicky Budvar producers of the original Budweiser beer had to
shut down for two days because of water and power shortages.</TE>

<HD>3 Shot in Stands at Irwindale Speedway</HD>
<DH>Violence: Thrown bottle escalates into gunfire, a witness
says. Wounds described as serious.</DH>

<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A gunman opened fire in the grandstands of the Irwindale Speedway
Thursday night, wounding three people, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting at the racetrack, 13300 Live Oak Ave., occurred
shortly after 10 p.m., said Los Angeles County fire dispatch
supervisor Ray Dong.</LD>
<LD>   Three people, two males and a female, were taken to hospitals, the
Fire Department dispatcher said. One was reported in full cardiac
arrest, a second was in critical condition and the third was in
serious condition. One of the victims reportedly had been shot in the
back.</LD>
<TE>   Four to five people were detained for questioning, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Witness Jake Garcia, 24, said the disturbance began when someone
in the bleachers threw a bottle that hit someone below. Two groups
confronted each other, and one man pulled out a gun and began
shooting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because a race was in progress on the track, "everybody thought it
was a backfire," Garcia said. When they realized what had happened,
the several hundred people in the stands fled for their cars, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Police and the racetrack's security officers were still
questioning witnesses at midnight and had ordered everyone else to
leave the speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Since last year, Irwindale Speedway has offered its eighth-mile
course to would-be street rodders every Thursday night, allowing them
to race their own cars against each other.</TE>
<TE>   The races, sanctioned by the National Hot Rod Assn., also are run
at tracks in Fontana and Palmdale. They're intended to get hot
rodders off the streets and into a controlled environment without
endangering others on the street.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council approved a bill extending domestic partnership
rights to legally sanctioned same-sex couples visiting New York.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters said the bill was needed because such couples are
sometimes denied rights taken for granted by gays and lesbians in the
city, such as hospital visitation.</LD>
<LD>   The law is intended to cover gays from cities such as Los Angeles
that have domestic partnership laws and nations such as Holland that
recognize gay marriages.</LD>
<TE>   Visitors would have to show a certificate indicating they have
legally registered their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   The bill must be signed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg; a spokesman
did not immediately return a call seeking comment on his stance on
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The measure passed 34-7. Brooklyn Democrat Simcha Felder was among
the dissenters. "I believe that a broad spectrum of New Yorkers would
find this legislation to be morally offensive," Felder said.</TE>

<LD>Katherine Harris' opponent in the Republican primary for a Florida
congressional seat sued to have the former secretary of state kicked
off the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit argues that Harris should be removed from the ballot
because she violated a state law that required her to file a letter
of intent to resign as secretary when she qualified to run for
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   If Harris were stricken from the Sept. 10 primary, John Hill, the
former TV anchor who filed the suit, would win the GOP nomination.</LD>
<TE>   Harris called the suit frivolous. She resigned Aug. 1, saying she
had misunderstood the rules. She should have filed the letter July
15.</TE>

<HD>Uproar Over Film About Fallen Priest</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Drama sparks a battle between liberals and bishops
that reflects the church's power shift.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic hierarchy in this fervidly Catholic
country prefers silent ways of confronting scandal. Last month, after
learning about "The Crime of Father Amaro," several bishops arranged
to watch a private screening of the unreleased film at Interior
Ministry headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   One bishop was so offended he walked out before the end. Carlos
Carrera's movie portrays a small-town Mexican priest who struggles
with his celibacy vows and has sex with a 16-year-old girl. Senior
clerics quietly urged the government of Vicente Fox, Mexico's first
openly Catholic president in more than a century, to ban the film.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the movie is opening today at 358 theaters across the
country, the widest release ever for a Mexican film. It stars Gael
Garcia Bernal, one of Mexico's most popular young actors, as the
errant Father Amaro and has created a buzz of clerical outrage and
liberal counterattack on the airwaves and in news columns here.</LD>
<TE>   No event since Fox's election two summers ago illustrates more
clearly the paradox of the church's new place in Mexico: After
chafing for seven decades under a rigidly secular one-party state,
the bishops enjoy a higher public profile and easier access to the
corridors of power. Yet, on many things that matter to them, their
voices are heeded no more, and sometimes less, than before.</TE>
<TE>   "El Crimen del Padre Amaro," as the film is called in Spanish, is
premiering at an awkward time for Mexico's Catholic clergy, which has
not escaped the real-life sex abuse scandals shaking the Roman
Catholic Church in the U.S. and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican Bishops Conference, which has condemned the film as
"an insult to the religious beliefs of Catholics," won nothing more
than a brief delay so that "Father Amaro" wouldn't draw attention
from Pope John Paul II, who visited Mexico from July 30 to Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the old regime, the church was less visible, but it had
subtle ways of influencing what people were allowed to see or read,"
said Roberto Blancarte Pimentel, a religion specialist at the Colegio
de Mexico. "The same democratic forces that brought Fox to power now
make it impossible for him to practice that kind of censorship. Our
society has become accustomed to free expression as never before."</TE>
<TE>   Investors were so leery of the old Mexico that it took Carrera and
one of the film's producers, Daniel Birman Ripstein, seven years to
line up the $1.8 million financing from Argentine, French, Mexican
and Spanish pockets. Among the other producers is Don Alfredo
Ripstein, who has been trying to develop the film since 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Buena Vista/Columbia TriStar, the equally wary distributor,
deliberately kept trailers and advertisements for the film vague,
focusing more on its stars than its sinful themes.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico--where 88% of the population is Catholic, the pope a
folk hero and the Virgin of Guadalupe a national mother figure--those
themes are explosive. Their use reflects a five-year trend toward
edgy, contemporary films that have brought Mexicans flocking to
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   In the movie, Father Amaro, freshly ordained and newly assigned to
a stiflingly small pueblo in Veracruz state, succumbs to Amelia,
impregnates the young parishioner and then abandons her. He also
becomes the protege of Father Benito, an older priest who is having
an affair with Amelia's mother and has ties to drug traffickers and
leftist guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   Vicente Lenero's script has adapted an 1875 novel by Portuguese
satirist Jose Eca de Queiroz to give what Mexican reviewer Eduardo
Alvarado called "a rude inspection of the Catholic Church as an
institution" in modern-day Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   While tackling such topics as clerical sex, abortion
and liberation theology, Alvarado wrote in the newspaper Reforma, the
film highlights "the enormous gulf between the teachings of the
church and the beliefs of Catholics."</TE>
<TE>   That approach may be a hit with moviegoers in Mexico, where
surveys confirm that Catholics favor birth control, oppose religious
education and are open to abortion--positions that have forced Fox to
retreat from pledges to back key elements of the church's political
agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Even such committed Catholics as the president and the first lady,
Martha Sahagun de Fox, are at odds with some dogma; both divorced,
they were wed last year in a civil ceremony without having their
first marriages annulled by the church.</TE>
<TE>   And, as church officials quietly admit, Mexico has real-life
characters like the priest portrayed by Garcia Bernal, who starred in
last year's Oscar-nominated "Amores Perros" and more recently in "Y
Tu Mama Tambien." A number of priests, especially in rural Mexico,
have girlfriends or live-in companions, and many parishioners
tolerate the unions.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia Bernal, whose mug looks down from promotional billboards in
a clerical collar, says he is getting about 30 e-mail petitions a day
from fans who want to confess their sins to him--evidence, perhaps,
of the erosion of support in the pews for Catholic authority.</TE>
<TE>   In scattered parishes across Mexico last Sunday, priests took to
the pulpit to call for a boycott of the film, arguing that clerics
like the fictional Father Amaro are unrepresentative. "It's like
pornography," Msgr. Hernan Zambrano told his flock in Monterrey.
"Once you watch porn, you cannot get the images out of your head."</TE>
<TE>   The instinct to hide problem priests made headlines last
spring--and prompted a public outcry--when the Mexican Bishops
Conference defended its practice of covering up child sexual abuse
cases to protect the church and the victims. "Dirty laundry is best
washed at home," Sergio Obeso, archbishop of Jalapa, told reporters
then.</TE>
<TE>   But the hierarchy's main objection to "Father Amaro" is a pair of
scenes that the bishops conference said "makes a mockery of the
Catholic community's most sacred religious symbols."</TE>
<TE>   A love scene reportedly shows Garcia Bernal handing a shawl
bearing the Virgin Mary's image to his mistress, played by Ana
Claudia Talancon, to cover her body. In another scene, an alley cat
gobbles a Communion wafer spat on the floor by a churchgoer.</TE>
<TE>   Both scenes were cited in a criminal complaint filed Monday by the
Pro-Life anti-abortion group against Interior Minister Santiago Creel
for failing to use his authority under federal law to ban the
film--which is rated B-15, not recommended for those under 15--and
Culture Minister Sari Bermudez for approving $350,000 in government
financing.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-Life, which has close ties to the church hierarchy, says it is
distributing 400,000 leaflets urging a boycott of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The government has found itself in the middle of other such
battles in recent years. In 2000, it tried unsuccessfully to ban the
politically sardonic "La Ley de Herodes" ("Herod's Law"). Last year,
director Alfonso Cuaron sued the Interior Ministry over the rating
given to "Y Tu Mama Tambien," which he maintained was arbitrary and
shut out most of the younger audience he wanted to reach.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic leaders used to win their share of these censorship
struggles. Despite 19th century anticlerical laws that kept the
church all but invisible until 1992, Mexico's bishops starting in the
1940s achieved a rapprochement with the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, that allowed them a degree of political
and social influence behind the scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure from bishops, for example, forced a six-year delay in the
Mexican release of Arturo Ripstein's 1977 film "La Viuda Negra"
("Black Widow"), in which a priest shares with his mistress what he
hears in the confessional. And Martin Scorcese's controversial 1988
movie, "The Last Temptation of Christ," was never released in Mexican
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   What appalls today's bishops is that this clout has waned
under Fox, whose National Action Party was founded by persecuted Catholics
in the 1930s and whose election ended the PRI's rule in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After Fox's government ignored the quiet calls of
individual bishops to ban "Father Amaro," the church this week openly
attacked the film while appealing to "the judgment and maturity of
Catholics...to distinguish the truth from insults to the faith."</TE>
<TE>   In response, the film's actors have granted interviews and called
news conferences to portray the bishops as out-of-touch parents
lecturing grown-up children. "We are tired of being treated like
idiots," Garcia Bernal said.</TE>
<TE>   "The film is about the church as an institution, not about
religion," said Carrera, a practicing Catholic best known here for
directing the 1998 feature "Un Embrujo," or "Under a Spell." "It is a
reflection on people who use religion to their own advantage and who
hide behind a veil of hypocrisy."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the public battle could boost the film's audience.</TE>
<TE>   "This controversy is excellent publicity," said Antonio Gonzalez,
a 21-year-old Catholic engineering student who joined the lines here
Thursday for advance ticket sales. "I don't understand why the church
is making all this noise. When they say we must not go, it backfires
and people become more interested."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Sees a Duty to Oust Iraq Leader</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Bush advisor Rice urges Britain, a pivotal ally,
to help prevent Hussein from wreaking havoc at home and beyond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a bid to win support from America's closest ally, National
Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told Britain on Thursday that the
outside world has a historic obligation to oust Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein or face inevitable global "havoc" perpetrated by his
regime.</LD>
<LD>   In a radio interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., she
invoked the imagery--and the stakes--of the World War II alliance in
imploring Britain for its support.</LD>
<LD>   "History is littered with cases of inaction that led to grave
consequences for the world. We just have to look back and ask how
many dictators who ended up being a tremendous global threat and
killing thousands and, indeed, millions of people should we have
stopped in their tracks," Rice said in the interview, which was
broadcast Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   As the Bush administration intensifies its rhetorical campaign for
moving against Iraq, Britain is arguably the pivotal foreign
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Britain has been the only country from the 1991 Persian Gulf War
coalition of more than 30 nations to remain steadfast in its
collaboration with Washington, but it has been notably cool to a new
confrontation with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly do not have the luxury of doing nothing," Rice said,
adding that the United States has a "very powerful moral case" to
justify action.</TE>
<TE>   Left to his own devices, Hussein will "wreak havoc again on his
own population, his neighbors and, if he gets weapons of mass
destruction and the means to deliver them, all of us," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Britain again launched its aircraft alongside U.S.
warplanes in strikes in Iraq's southern "no-fly" zone, established
after the Gulf War to protect the local population from air attacks
by Hussein's military.</TE>
<TE>   But polls show that the British public remains deeply reluctant to
get any more deeply enmeshed in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Rice's appeal for support came as a prominent member of Britain's
ruling Labor Party warned that Prime Minister Tony Blair faces
"substantial resistance" among his own ranks in Parliament to a
U.S.-led offensive against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Blair would find it difficult to support and participate in a war
against Iraq," said Gerald Kaufman, a member of Parliament who has
served as the party's foreign policy spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The only support for an offensive comes from the opposition
Conservative Party, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman charged that Bush was "intellectually backward" and said
the president was surrounded by advisors "whose bellicosity is
exceeded only by their political, military and diplomatic
illiteracy." He made his remarks in Britain's Spectator magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Without either Britain's tacit approval or its involvement,
Washington is unlikely to win backing from other key allies or the
three other permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council--China, France and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Even members of the administration during the Gulf War are
skittish.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Scowcroft, who held Rice's job during that conflict, noted
in Thursday's Wall Street Journal: "Our preeminent security
priority--underscored repeatedly by the president--is the war on
terrorism. An attack on Iraq at this time would seriously jeopardize,
if not destroy, the global counterterrorist campaign we have
undertaken."</TE>
<TE>   But in another sign that the Bush administration is pushing ahead
with its plans, the State Department revealed Thursday that it
expects to sign contracts worth $6.6 million with private groups to
provide health, education and other humanitarian services for Iraqis
inside and outside their country.</TE>
<TE>   "I would think that at the end of any action that we might take
toward regime change, it would be an obligation for all of us to make
certain that things are better for the people of the country and the
people of the region," Rice told the BBC.</TE>
<TE>   The interview was aired as Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command
Council nominated Hussein, who has been president since 1979, for
another term.</TE>
<TE>   The council said Thursday that Hussein provided "a strong
guarantee" against "imperialist and Zionists' plots."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's 250-member National Assembly, which is tightly controlled
by Hussein's Arab Baath Socialist Party, is expected to endorse the
nomination, and a referendum to formally renew his mandate is set for
Oct. 15, according to the official Iraqi News Agency.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi leadership said Thursday that it is "open for dialogue"
with the United Nations on weapons inspections--despite comments by a
Cabinet minister this week ruling out the prospect of further
negotiations or inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe dialogue without preset decisions and intentions is
the correct and only way to solve any problem," said Iraqi Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   "Another date for the next round has not been set due to U.S.
pressure, but we say that this dialogue is still standing and
necessary," he told Abu Dhabi television.</TE>
<TE>   Ramadan also said Baghdad was willing to talk directly to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials say Hussein's regime acts as if it is an equal
partner in any talks, rather than the vanquished party in a military
rout.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not think we have ever rejected direct dialogue with the
U.S. administration--[provided] that there are no terms," Ramadan
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a dialogue in which each of us respects the opinion of
the other and does not interfere in internal affairs."</TE>

<HD>Baseball Owners, Players Balk at a Level Playing Field</HD>
<DH>Labor: Amid talk of another strike, some say it's time to
modernize the sport's economic structure.</DH>
<SE>First in a series</SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the field, the Arizona Diamondbacks are at the top of their game.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the team beat the seemingly invincible New York Yankees
in the World Series. The Diamondbacks reached the fall classic in
just four years, a record for an expansion team.</LD>
<LD>   To get there, the club cut no corners. It paid big salaries and
built a $350-million luxury stadium, drawing some of the biggest
crowds in baseball.</LD>
<TE>   But off the field, the Phoenix franchise is one of the sport's
biggest money losers, which prompts the question: What do you have to
do to make a buck in the Grand Ol' Game?</TE>
<TE>   The reality, according to baseball executives and sports
economists, is that the financial problems plaguing the major league
are so entrenched that only a sweeping overhaul can return the game
to health. But every avenue for substantive change is resisted by
owners, players or politicians, virtually ensuring problems for years
to come.</TE>
<TE>   In less than a decade, baseball's collective debt has grown from
$593 million to about $4 billion as teams have spent beyond their
means in a mad dash to keep pace with the Yankees, the richest in
baseball. The Yankees not only have an unrivaled fan base but a huge
local TV contract that allowed them to spend a record $140 million on
player salaries this year, putting other teams at an instant
disadvantage, especially those in smaller markets.</TE>
<TE>   That dynamic has driven up annual salaries to an average of $2.4
million, a 71% jump in just five years. Teams across the country have
built stunning new ballparks--with the help of local taxpayers--to
draw bigger crowds to pay the rising bills, only to see aisles of
empty seats in some of them. Even in cities where attendance remains
solid, the money is not enough to meet expenses. Half a dozen teams
are quietly on the market. Only a decade ago they would have been
snapped up, but no buyers are in sight.</TE>
<TE>   Now looms the prospect of another strike, which would be the ninth
since 1972. The last one, in 1994, canceled the World Series. Today,
the players union is expected to vote on whether to set a strike date
in hope of accelerating negotiations that have stalled. The two sides
are tackling such prickly issues as revenue sharing among teams,
shrinking the number of clubs, drug testing and the stratospheric
salaries.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever agreement ultimately is reached, the result probably
will be something more akin to a bloop single than a game-winning
homer.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening now is a repeat of 1994 because these same
problems were never resolved," said Bruce K. Johnson, an economics
professor at Centre College in Danville, Ky. "They are trying to put
Band-Aids on the problem and it's not a scratch--it's an illness that
could be terminal if there's another strike and a mass exodus of
fans."</TE>
<TE>   No Cap on Salaries</TE>
<TE>   Among the professional sports leagues--the National Basketball
Assn., the National Football League and the National Hockey
League--only baseball has balked at modernizing its economic
structure, which now requires little compromise or sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball's economic model wasn't in place just before television
or radio but before flight, before the internal combustion engine,"
said columnist George Will, a member of the 2000 Blue Ribbon Panel on
Baseball Economics commissioned by major league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   In baseball, there are no caps on player paychecks as in other
sports. Big-market teams with sky-high local TV revenue, such as the
Yankees, are not forced to pool large percentages of their money for
the benefit of less fortunate clubs, as they are in the NBA and the
NFL. Baseball also is the only sport exempt from federal antitrust
regulations, meaning that owners can control the number and location
of teams as a monopoly would. Members of Congress, for their part,
use the threat of revoking the exemption as way to obtain or save
teams in their districts.</TE>
<TE>   A complication underlying almost every proposal to fix the sport's
finances is the deep lack of trust that has developed between players
and owners. Many players and their agents say the owners are
exaggerating the severity of their problems to gain the upper hand
during the labor negotiations. Instead of answering the charges, the
owners have refused to open their books.</TE>
<TE>   Losses cited by teams owned by media conglomerates can be
misleading. The Atlanta Braves, owned by AOL Time Warner Inc., and
the Los Angeles Dodgers, owned by News Corp., reported losses last
year. So did the Chicago Cubs, owned by Tribune Co., which also owns
the Los Angeles Times. But analysts say the corporate parents have
profited by developing television networks built around their clubs'
games whose massive values are not reflected on the teams' ledgers.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the Bottom Line</TE>
<TE>   Cable riches played a big role in the recent $700-million sale of
the Boston Red Sox. The team reported a loss of $13.7 million last
year. The sale included the team, Fenway Park stadium and control of
the New England Sports Network, which carries most Red Sox games as
well as other sports. The network alone was valued at an estimated
$325 million in the sale.</TE>
<TE>   "People who invest in professional sports teams get all sorts of
value that does not show up on the bottom line," said Andrew S.
Zimbalist, a sports economist at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball players also dismiss the argument that payrolls are
driving teams to the brink of bankruptcy, citing the record sale
prices of teams such as the Red Sox. Many financial problems, they
say, are the result of mismanagement by owners and overexpansion by
baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lot of hocus-pocus by the league," said agent Scott
Boras, who represents 70 players, including shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
whose 10-year, $252-million contract with the Texas Rangers set a
baseball record. "No franchise has sold for a loss."</TE>
<TE>   But the owners say the players are perpetuating some of baseball's
most vexing problems to keep their salaries on the rise.
Specifically, the players union has opposed revamping the way
baseball shares the wealth among its teams.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 teams contribute 20% of their local revenue from tickets,
concessions, parking and TV contracts to baseball's central pot,
which is redistributed with poorer teams getting more than richer
ones. Because the disparity remains so great, many owners want
sharing to increase to 50% of locally generated revenue.</TE>
<TE>   But the players, no matter what their team, have opposed plans for
such a substantial split. The reason: They want the Yankees to have
as much money as possible to keep paying increasingly big salaries,
thereby lifting paydays across the league.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at what the union is doing, the primary goal is to
protect the Yankees' payroll," Will said. "The union's position, and
they have not been wrong over the years, is a few high-spending teams
pull the entire payroll structure up. But the trouble is, you're
right until you're in a disaster."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of self-interest plays out across almost every possible
solution to baseball's financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   In the business world, a company with such huge debts that
continues to spend more than it makes eventually goes into bankruptcy
protection. In baseball, that's not a realistic option because of the
ripple effects.</TE>
<TE>   A flurry of litigation would fan out across baseball, bankers say.
Cities with new publicly financed stadiums would sue if their team
went under and taxpayers were left with the bill. Owners would be
hauled into court by creditors for preventing the insolvent team from
relocating to a more lucrative market.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball also could be on the hook for loans it had guaranteed to
the faltering team. Any such suit could expose the inner workings of
baseball, a notoriously secretive society of mostly millionaire men.</TE>
<TE>   Some 40 players not only would be out of work but at the end of a
long line of creditors, a reality that would not be tolerated by the
union. "In bankruptcy, you could reject the contract of a pitcher
signed for 10 years," said Sal Galatioto, managing director and head
of the sports advisory and finance group at Lehman Bros., which
provided bankruptcy financing to the Pittsburgh Penguins, an National
Hockey League team.</TE>
<TE>   A crisis of confidence, he said, would hover over baseball as
banks pulled back on lending across the league, potentially throwing
other teams into distress. Franchise values would decline as new
investors demurred. And could a new owner buy the franchise out of
bankruptcy protection and locate it, say, across the river from
George Steinbrenner's Yankees, without baseball's approval?</TE>
<TE>   Rich Team, Poor Team</TE>
<TE>   With bankruptcy too damaging to the game, owners have tried to
eliminate, or contract, baseball's financial weaklings. Baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig has said that contraction is essential for the
sport to thrive. But again, the prospect of teams being phased out
has run into a buzz saw of special interests.</TE>
<TE>   Threaten a team's survival and watch members of Congress,
attorneys general and other government officials step up to protect
teams, players, fans, jobs and taxpayers who have shelled out
millions for new stadiums. And that doesn't include all the folks who
would be unhappy about losing any of the 200 minor league teams
affiliated with major league baseball.</TE>
<TE>   In November, just days after one of the most exciting World Series
in recent times, Selig announced that owners had voted to eliminate
two undisclosed teams. Although the targets later were revealed to be
the Montreal Expos and the Minnesota Twins, several others were
considered vulnerable, including the Detroit Tigers, the Florida
Marlins and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Selig's announcement, a Minnesota judge granted an
injunction preventing the Twins from breaking their long-term
municipal contract with the Metrodome stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Seven days after the owners' vote, Florida Atty. Gen. Bob
Butterworth subpoenaed documents from major league baseball, Selig
and the state's teams to find out whether the Marlins or Devil Rays
were being targeted for elimination. Only four years earlier, local
taxpayers had financed a $70-million renovation of Tropicana Field
for the Devil Rays expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   Issues of Trust, Antitrust</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) called hearings and
introduced legislation to eliminate baseball's exclusive antitrust
exemption when it that appeared Detroit's team, which has a new
stadium, might be endangered down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the onslaught, Selig and the owners retreated, tabling
a decision on the Twins until next year. At the same time, major
league baseball purchased the Expos for $120 million--$30 million
more than owner Jeffrey Loria had paid. The team is being run by the
league until questions about contraction are resolved in the labor
negotiations and a separate arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists say the best solution is not to get rid of ailing
teams but to revoke the antitrust exemption, allowing them to follow
the money into the biggest cities.</TE>
<TE>   "It would chop a big market down to size, so New York would have
two or three other teams fighting for local TV and ticket sales,"
said economics professor Johnson. "Suddenly, Kansas City wouldn't be
so small if a market like New York weren't so powerful."</TE>
<TE>   But eliminating the antitrust exemption is a pipe dream, he said.
"You have an entrenched monopoly power protected by this antitrust
exemption that Congress doesn't want to give up," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The owners don't want to get rid of it either, sometimes to their
own detriment.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, politicians were livid after Tampa Bay was twice
promised by major league baseball that teams would relocate there.
But both the Chicago White Sox and more recently the San Francisco
Giants backed out. Both used the threat of relocation to Tampa Bay to
get approval from their home cities for a new stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Butterworth challenged the antitrust exemption and, in
1994, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in his favor. The justices said
the exemption does not apply to the relocation of teams, prompting
Butterworth to open an investigation of whether baseball had
conspired to prevent the Giants' move to the Tampa-St. Petersburg
area.</TE>
<TE>   Major league baseball responded by giving Tampa Bay its team and
Butterworth dropped his investigation. In the end, however, baseball
was the loser. Tampa Bay is one of the worst-performing teams in
baseball, losing $10 million on operations last year even after
netting $12 million from other owners through revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   So why are owners so reluctant to give up the exemption? They're
protecting old-fashioned monopolies, economists say. Steinbrenner
doesn't relish a competitor in Brooklyn or New Jersey that could pick
off fans, force him to lower his ticket prices or compete for TV
revenue and corporate sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the problem with fixing baseball is that George doesn't
want to share," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner's pot of money has allowed his team to win four of
the last six World Series. Teams that want to stay in the game have
little choice but to pony up; high-payroll clubs have won 234 of the
274 postseason games played from 1995 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Owners worry that the Yankees' success on and off the field will
only grow. Last year, Steinbrenner formed a regional cable TV company
with the NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils. The
Yankees Entertainment &amp; Sports Network airs 130 of the Yankees' 162
regular season games. YES reaches 5.2 million customers and could
take in $109 million from cable and satellite TV subscriber fees this
year.</TE>
<TE>   YES pays the Yankees $54 million a year for local radio, cable,
broadcast and Internet rights, and 20%--or $11 million--is funneled
into baseball's revenue-sharing kitty. Owners say audits keep teams
from shortchanging the revenue-sharing pool. But since YES already
has an estimated market value of more than $800 million, the channel
improves the team's borrowing power.</TE>
<TE>   "There is more disposable income in 10 blocks of New York City
than in the whole state of Wisconsin," said Jeffrey Smulyan, a radio
entrepreneur and former owner of the Seattle Mariners. "And the more
the Yankees can capture of that, the wider the disparity between
big-and small-market teams becomes."</TE>

<HD>Stock Analyst Resigns Under Fire</HD>
<DH>Finance: Jack Grubman, who touted WorldCom, is under
scrutiny for his ties to failed companies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON, ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Jack Grubman, once the most powerful telecommunications analyst on
Wall Street, resigned from Salomon Smith Barney late Thursday amid a
litany of government probes into whether financial conflicts tainted
his stock recommendations.</LD>
<LD>   In what the brokerage called a "mutual agreement," Grubman
resigned after accepting a severance package totaling $13.2 mil-
lion.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman gained notoriety first for his early embrace of many new
telecom companies that emerged amid the industry's deregulation in
the mid-1990s, and then for his close ties to those companies,
including WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   The analyst remained steadfastly bullish even as the industry
collapsed in 2000 and 2001 and many of his telecom stock picks
shriveled in value.</TE>
<TE>   As his unusually close relationship with Salomon's investment
banking department came to light in recent months, critics charged
that Grubman's stock recommendations were primarily aimed at pleasing
the managements of the subject companies, in the hope of bringing
Salomon more fee-generating underwriting business.</TE>
<TE>   In his resignation letter, Grubman took equal turns defending his
work and lashing out at critics.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wrote what I believed," Grubman said, adding, "I
performed my work consistently with all laws and standards of
ethics."</TE>
<TE>   However, he said he was being unfairly targeted by a "relentless
series of negative statements about my work."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement to employees, Salomon Chairman Michael A. Carpenter
said he agreed that "recent events" made it tough for Grubman to
continue in his position.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, 48, rose to power by going beyond the traditional analyst
function of simply evaluating companies to helping broker investment
banking deals. Companies wanted coverage from the high-profile
analyst, and Grubman was expert in leveraging that into
behind-the-scenes merger advice and stock and bond underwriting work
for Salomon.</TE>
<TE>   But stock analysts have come under withering criticism as their
ties to their firms' investment banking departments have been exposed
against the backdrop of the worst stock market plunge in a
generation.</TE>
<TE>   Several regulatory and law enforcement agencies are investigating
Grubman for potential civil or criminal wrongdoing, including New
York State Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Spitzer released a series of embarrassing e-mails in
which Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analysts disparaged stocks privately even
while recommending them publicly to investors.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill settled Spitzer's case by paying $100 million and agreeing
to reform how its analysts conduct themselves. The reforms have since
been embraced by other major brokerages as Wall Street struggles to
restore its credibility with investors, particularly individuals.</TE>
<TE>   At a congressional hearing last month, Grubman was questioned
about his ties to WorldCom and queried about why he did not warn
investors about the now-bankrupt company's escalating troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman expressed remorse for maintaining his positive outlook as
WorldCom, and the telecom industry in general, crumbled under massive
debts. "I regret that I was wrong in rating WorldCom highly for too
long," he told members of the House Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But Grubman has not apologized for maintaining close ties to
managers of the companies he covered.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that he was able to attend three WorldCom board meetings
and analyze the company's financial data days before the general
public made him more informed than his competition, he has said. It
is highly unusual for brokerage analysts to enjoy that kind of access
to companies.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman told the congressional panel that even with his unusual
access, he had no idea that WorldCom had improperly accounted for
billions of dollars in expenses and was in such dire financial
condition.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason the spotlight shined brightest on Grubman was that
he acknowledged earning $20 million a year in recent
years--exorbitant even by Wall Street standards.</TE>
<TE>   For Salomon, the underwriting and merger-advisory work it
performed for telecom companies earned it hundreds of millions of
dollars in fees in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack's going to take the fall for the analysts," said one
longtime telecom analyst who requested anonymity. "Arthur Andersen's
taking the fall for accountants, and someone's got to take the fall
for the attorneys."</TE>
<TE>   Some experts speculated that Salomon was anxious to get rid of
Grubman in an attempt to extricate itself from a legal and public
relations drubbing.</TE>
<TE>   "I suspect no one at Salomon believes he is an asset to the firm,"
said John Coffee, a Columbia University securities law professor. "As
long as Salomon was holding onto Grubman and they were defending his
behavior, they were going to have trouble taking the high ground."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman's troubles placed more pressure on Citigroup Inc.,
Salomon's parent. Citigroup Chairman Sanford Weill, long considered
one of Wall Street's most respected leaders, has been aggressively
trying to rebuild the firm's image in the wake of its high-profile
involvement in several major controversies over the last year,
including the financing of Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup was a lender to the collapsed energy trader and has been
accused of helping it hide debt to mask its financial position.</TE>
<TE>   The 69-year-old Weill, in a letter to Citigroup employees in late
July, said he regretted "the pain that has been caused" by the bank's
business with Enron, but he insisted that the bank abided by all
legal requirements in structuring transactions with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed about Grubman by the Wall Street Journal in July,
Weill was asked if he thought Grubman had a future with Salomon.
Weill didn't address the question directly, but said: "Jack is a
smart person, but he was definitely wrong [on certain stock
recommendations]. In retrospect you might say he stayed too long in
those positions, but I think he believed what he was doing."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman was an unlikely Wall Street star. He grew up in a
blue-collar neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia, where his father
worked for the city and his mother worked in a dress shop. In his
youth, he earned money busing tables, selling beach umbrellas and
loading packages.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, a trained mathematician who once worked at AT&amp;T Corp.,
stood out among industry watchers by predicting that the new
generation of small telecom upstarts would grow faster and operate
more efficiently than the AT&amp;Ts of the world. After he jumped to
Salomon Bros. in 1994, widespread industry deregulation helped lend
credibility to his view.</TE>
<TE>   At Salomon, Grubman's role expanded from analyst to advisor. Among
his biggest clients were WorldCom and Global Crossing, two telecom
upstarts with bold visions for growth and huge appetites for deals
that ended up filing the two largest bankruptcy cases in the
industry's history.</TE>

<HD>Not Only Men Are Molesters</HD>
<DH>There is just one female violent sexual predator locked up
in the state, but experts say rape and child abuse by women are
underreported.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA DOLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are 351 men in California locked up in a state mental hospital
as sexually violent predators, prone to attack again and again.</LD>
<LD>   Then there is Charlotte Mae Thrailkill.</LD>
<LD>   The 43-year-old mother of two is California's only female violent
sex offender, confined to a maximum-security state mental hospital
after experts decided she was too dangerous for release.</LD>
<TE>   Only a handful of women, including Thrailkill, have ever been
confined to mental institutions under state laws that allow for civil
commitments of sex criminals after they have served their prison
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Women are less likely than men to commit sex offenses, but they
also are less likely to be reported and prosecuted. Many experts
contend that women commit sex offenses far more often than is
generally believed.</TE>
<TE>   "It happens a lot more than gets reported, and I think part of
that is due to our culture," said Steven B. Blum, a consulting
psychologist to a sex offender program in Nebraska. "There are a lot
of women who have sexual contact with teenage boys, and they don't
get reported."</TE>
<TE>   In the state's regular prison system, only 103 of the 9,746 women
behind bars--1.06%--are there for sex offenses, including statutory
rape and lewd acts with children. That compares with about 12,500
men, 8% of the total male prison population.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Federoff, a forensic psychiatrist in Ottawa, Canada, said one
of the female sex offenders he counsels is an exhibitionist. She
opens her living room curtains and strips off her clothes when people
pass by.</TE>
<TE>   He told her that unless she stopped this illegal activity, she
would be arrested.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Doctor, if someone calls up and says he saw me disrobing in the
window, who do you think they are going arrest? Me or him?' "
Federoff said she replied.</TE>
<TE>   "And she is absolutely right."</TE>
<TE>   It was widely assumed until recently that women just didn't
sexually abuse children, Federoff said.</TE>
<TE>   But during the past two decades, as parents and others have
encouraged children to disclose improper sexual behavior, kids have
been confiding about abuse by women as well as men.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are discovering that there are a lot of women who do
sexually abuse children, but they get away with it," Federoff said.
"There is a growth industry of treatment programs, particularly for
adolescent female sex offenders who commit a lot of the crimes while
they are baby-sitting."</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill, whose sexual predator status is up for review by the
state in September, told psychiatrists she molested children, ages 5
to 8, whom she baby-sat or enticed into her Santa Rosa apartment to
play with her children. Her story, pieced together from court
records, is a less a rarity than crime statistics suggest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill, the third of six children, was born with scoliosis and
a deformity in her mouth that caused speech difficulties. "She stated
that school was difficult for her, not only due to her learning
difficulties but also due to constant ridicule by her peers because
of her physical deformities," according to a state mental heath
report on file in Santa Rosa.</TE>
<TE>   When older children picked on her during elementary school, "she
would then bully and beat smaller, defenseless children," according
to the May 2000 report.</TE>
<TE>   She told counselors that she had a good relationship with her
father, but complained that her mother regularly beat her with narrow
leather straps, sticks and her fists. Thrailkill ran away several
times between the ages of 11 and 16 and was gang-raped at age 15, she
told authorities, by four men who grabbed her off a street.</TE>
<TE>   That same year she was severely wounded in a random shooting and
spent nine months in a hospital. She never returned to school.</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill married a U.S. Marine at 19. They had two daughters.
She left him five years later, complaining their marriage was
sexless, and won custody of their daughters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Women who commit sex offenses often fit into one of three
categories.</TE>
<TE>   The "teacher-lover" or "Mrs. Robinson" type has sex with underage
boys. These women fancy themselves in love with the boy and don't see
the relationships as harmful, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   The women tend to be immature and get an "ego boost" from the
involvement, said Blum, the Nebraska psychologist, who counsels such
offenders. "Without exception, all of our patients have had a
substance abuse problem and also were partying with their victims,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally the male doesn't feel victimized," he said. "A lot of
teenage boys would see that as their lucky day."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such perceptions, researchers maintain that many boys may
be left confused and angry, and if they are particularly young, they
may be sexualized too early and have sexual problems later in life.</TE>
<TE>   Women who have sex with minors make the same kinds of excuses as
their male counterparts, said Florence Wolfe, co-director of
Northwest Treatment Associates, a Seattle-based program for sex
offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe said the women tell her: " 'I wanted the closeness, the
excitement, not the sex. I wanted the safety. He was 13. I was only
27. The kid wanted it.' "</TE>
<TE>   A study of college students and prisoners found that 16% of the
college men and 46% of the male prisoners reported they had sexual
experience before the age of 16 with a woman at least five years
older. The average age of the men at the time of the contact was 12.</TE>
<TE>   A second type of offender is called "predisposed" and includes
mothers who molest their children.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe says more than 50% of the 150 female offenders she has
counseled molested their own children, primarily daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Some women considered predisposed to sexually molest children are
pedophiles with an assortment of mental illnesses. Wolfe described
one such offender she has met as a sexual sadist.</TE>
<TE>   "She looks like everybody's lovable grandmother: pink cheeks, gray
hair, chunky," Wolfe said. "She volunteered to baby-sit for young
single moms. They jumped at the chance."</TE>
<TE>   Most of this offender's victims were girls, and most were not yet
verbal. The woman would slap them until their teeth cut their mouths
or start a nosebleed. Their pain gave her sexual pleasure, Wolfe
said.</TE>
<TE>   "She finally molested a 4-year-old, and that kid was verbal enough
to tell someone," Wolfe said.</TE>
<TE>   The third type of female sex criminal is called the "male-coerced"
or "male-accompanied" offender. These women commit sex crimes in the
company of a man. Thrailkill, who declined to be interviewed for this
story, fits in this category.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill told psychologists that she had sex with 20 to 50
different men in the year after her divorce. She eventually met Daryl
Ball and allowed him and his young sons to move into her apartment in
Santa Rosa. Ball introduced Thrailkill to sex with children,
according to a state Mental Health Department report filed with Santa
Rosa Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill at the time was thin, with long, dark blond hair. She
looked older than her 27 years. She was quiet, shy and submissive,
attorneys recall.</TE>
<TE>   Seven years her senior, Ball was a brutal boyfriend, Thrailkill
told others. She said he violently sodomized her, threw her from a
car once and beat her to unconsciousness twice.</TE>
<TE>   She molested his sons, police said. Not only was Ball aware of the
molestations, he joined her in having sex with children, police and
criminal records say.</TE>
<TE>   Ball and Thrailkill had sex a couple of times a day with children
and with as many as five children at a time, she told psychiatrists.
The victims were her boyfriend's sons and other children in the
apartment complex whom Thrailkill baby-sat or lured into their
apartment.</TE>
<TE>   During the eight months in which she molested, Thrailkill drank
and used methamphetamine, first snorting the drug and later injecting
it, she told mental health workers.</TE>
<TE>   "When she was intoxicated, she was sexually promiscuous, violent
and sexually perverse," according to a May 2001 report by the state
Department of Mental Health.</TE>
<TE>   Both Thrailkill and Ball threatened the children that their
parents or siblings would be killed if they told anyone. Eventually,
one of the children did tell, and Thrailkill and Ball were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   When a parent of one of the victims confronted Thrailkill, she
said she molested because she was "afraid" of Ball, who was then 34.</TE>
<TE>   "He made me do it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But in records on file at the Santa Rosa courthouse, Thrailkill
admitted she molested five children--four boys and one girl--on her
own. She said she abused them to get even with the victims' parents.</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill typically endured extensive mistreatment in
relationships, a mental health evaluation found. When she finally
felt sufficiently hurt by the abuse, she lashed out at others.</TE>
<TE>   "She admits she takes anger out on weaker, often innocent
individuals," a mental health counselor wrote.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A 1981 national study of both reported and unreported child abuse
indicated that as many as 24% of boys and 14% of girls who are
molested are victimized by women.</TE>
<TE>   Although sexual abuse by both men and women is underreported,
female offenders are less likely than men to be prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had so many clients, both males and females, who talked
about mothers or their baby-sitters molesting them," said Charlene
Steen, a psychologist in Napa who has treated sex offenders for 20
years. "And they were never reported."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Kolodny, who has directed behavioral research
institutes and written about sexual behavior, said he periodically
gets calls from befuddled prosecutors who have cases in which a man
has accused a woman of rape.</TE>
<TE>   "Although it sounds counterintuitive, men can indeed be raped,"
Kolodny said.</TE>
<TE>   People commonly assume that men cannot be forced into sex against
their will. But experts say men may be physically capable of sex even
while under extreme duress.</TE>
<TE>   Female rapists are sometimes acquaintances of their victims and
get them drunk or drugged before they force them to submit to sexual
acts.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really have good studies that would give us an accurate
picture of how often it happens, but it is not rare ... not a
one-in-a-thousand kind of thing," Kolodny said.</TE>
<TE>   Some case studies describe rapes of men committed by two or more
women. In a report in the Archives of Sexual Behavior, two physicians
described 11 cases of rapes of men, including a man who picked up a
woman in a bar and then went to a motel with her.</TE>
<TE>   The man had a drink and fell asleep, the 1982 report said. When he
awoke, he was gagged, blindfolded and tied to the bed. He heard the
voices of several women.</TE>
<TE>   Steen, who is also a lawyer, described one man who was drugged and
raped by two women and a man. The victim was later found wandering
the streets with his clothes tied around his neck.</TE>
<TE>   Observed Steen: "There are women out there who are doing some
pretty horrible things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill initially faced more than 50 counts of felony child
molesting. She pleaded no contest in 1988 to five counts of
molestation in exchange for a 14-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Ball, whom Thrailkill married after the arrests but divorced while
in prison, pleaded no contest to several counts of lewd and
lascivious conduct upon children and was sentenced to 24 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill began serving her sentence in September 1988 and was
paroled in September 1994. She then worked in construction and had
what court records described as two "normal" relationships with adult
men.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1996, she violated her parole by using alcohol,
associating with convicted sex offenders and having contact with
children.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to prison and again was paroled in March 1998. Within
a month, parole was revoked because she had used alcohol. The state
began proceedings to commit her as a sex predator, and she did not
oppose the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Marie Case, a Santa Rosa criminal defense lawyer who represented
her, said Thrailkill was "intimidated by the whole proceeding" and
horrified that media coverage might hurt her daughters, who were then
in school.</TE>
<TE>   "I found her to be very shy and very private, and it was very
painful for her to discuss" her past, Case said.</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill was certified as a sexually violent predator in
September 1998 and sent to Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino
County.</TE>
<TE>   Like other sex predators who have been committed, Thrailkill's
status must be reviewed by the state every two years. She may be
recommitted only if two mental health experts determine her mental
problems make her likely to molest again.</TE>
<TE>   During therapy, she has expressed regret about her two daughters,
who are now adults. Thrailkill conceded at the hospital that her
daughters had been "sexual victims of her husband and emotional
victims of her," a report said.</TE>
<TE>   Ball, now 50, was released on parole in January. Two
state-appointed mental health experts evaluated him and found he does
not have a mental disorder that makes him likely to molest again.</TE>
<TE>   Thrailkill is scheduled to leave Patton in September unless the
state tries to renew her commitment.</TE>
<TE>   A staff psychologist with the department wrote that Thrailkill
does not wish to be released until she is convinced she can "manage"
her behavior. According to a May 2000 report, she has "genuine shame
for her behavior and remorse for her victims."</TE>
<TE>   "She has never shown any interest in coming out," Case said. "I
think she feels safe there."</TE>

<HD>Talk Radio Gives Simon Free Soapbox</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Hurting for money, Davis' challenger finds
conservative hosts eager to help spread his message, despite some
awkward moments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lee Rodgers and Melanie Morgan, the hosts of a radio talk show, make
no pretense of neutrality when they interview Bill Simon Jr., the
Republican candidate for governor.</LD>
<LD>   "When are we going to see some commercials from you, Bill, that
show Gray Davis to be the liar and the pathetic person that he really
is?" Morgan asked Simon on the show last week.</LD>
<LD>   "And preferably drowning puppies," Rodgers added.</LD>
<TE>   Once every two weeks, Simon joins Rodgers and Morgan in trashing
Davis, the Democratic incumbent, on KSFO-AM (560), a San Francisco
station aimed at conservative listeners in the Bay Area.</TE>
<TE>   It's a familiar venue for Simon: The conservative talk-radio
circuit is a key part of his campaign strategy. For a candidate with
relatively little money to spend on television ads, the radio shows
offer Simon a forum for broadcasting his message--unfiltered by
journalists--to thousands of voters.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign's cash shortfall was underscored Wednesday when
it laid off about 30 employees, including some who signed up with
Simon when he was an asterisk in the polls. The cuts were made to
save money for television ads in September and October.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two weeks, Simon's radio schedule has grown
particularly active as he has struggled to recover from the flood of
bad publicity after a jury's fraud verdict against his investment
firm, William E. Simon &amp; Sons. Simon has appeared on more than a
dozen conservative radio shows this month.</TE>
<TE>   Among his hosts are conservative regulars: Bill Manders in Fresno,
Paul McGuire in Costa Mesa, Inga Barks in Bakersfield, Eric Hogue in
Sacramento, Brian Wilson in San Francisco, and Hugh Hewitt in San
Diego, Los Angeles, the Inland Empire and parts of Northern
California.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're short on dough, which he appears to be, it makes
eminent sense to be doing this," said Ken Khachigian, a veteran GOP
strategist who is not working on the governor's race.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the radio shows enable Simon to reach his base of
conservative voters. By and large, they are unlikely to gravitate
toward Davis. But for 10 weeks, Davis has battered Simon's image with
statewide television ads that depict him as a boardroom scoundrel. In
an era of corporate scandals, strategists say, even staunch
conservatives are apt to be unnerved by the $78-million verdict
against Simon's firm that is highlighted in a Davis ad that began
airing Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is "trying to keep talking to the base so they won't be
discouraged and just not show up and vote," said Democratic
strategist Bill Carrick.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's war chest is roughly one-sixth the size of the governor's;
by the close of the last reporting period in June, he had $5 million
on hand, enough for only a few weeks of television ads.</TE>
<TE>   But until the TV spots begin, the radio shows enable Simon to cast
himself in a more favorable light, albeit with an audience of
listeners nowhere near as large as the millions of California
television viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The radio shows also remove Simon from the high-risk environment
of campaign stops with the  mainstream media. All summer, TV news
cameras have shot pictures of Democratic Party protesters shouting at
Simon and waving signs that call him a tax cheat. Reporters have
questioned Simon about his tax returns, the fraud case and other
subjects that detract from the Republican's main focus: Davis' track
record as governor.</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, the radio shows also save travel time. Simon dropped
off the campaign trail a week ago after a stop in San Diego, but
since then has done seven radio interviews by phone, including six on
conservative shows. On Sunday and Monday, he called radio stations
from Lake Tahoe, where he was taking a long weekend with his family.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to do as many radio shows as possible," said Simon
spokesman Mark Miner.</TE>
<TE>   "We view this as an avenue to keep our strong supporters informed,
and to attract new supporters."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to conservative shows, Simon is a regular guest on
mainstream news programs, Miner said.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, chief strategist of the governor's reelection
campaign, said Simon was trying to create the illusion of campaigning
by talking to radio hosts who were "slobbering all over him."</TE>
<TE>   "He's preaching to the choir," South said. "My God, if this guy
doesn't have his far right flank nailed down at this point, his
campaign is hopeless."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the hosts let Simon use the free air time to
bash Davis and to promote his agenda for tax cuts, a rollback of
state regulations, school reforms and improvements in the state's
road, water and power systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill, if you are elected governor, and I hope that you will be,
because you'll certainly have my vote, how are you going to get us
out of this huge $24-billion deficit without raising taxes?" McGuire
asked him last week on KBRT-AM (740).</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to have to shrink the government and stimulate the
economy in a nutshell, Paul," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even on conservative radio, Simon has been unable to dodge
questions about his finances. On Tuesday, Carlos Ortega of KLTX-AM
(1390) in Los Angeles invited Simon to clear away accusations that he
was "a crook."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you owe the IRS any money?" Ortega asked.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Simon replied.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever been convicted by a court of law for any fraudulent
matter?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of Ortega's interview was less pointed. But he finished
by asking Simon if he would come back another time to discuss Davis'
attempt "to impose on businessmen the will of a small group of
radical homosexual activists."</TE>
<TE>   Ortega didn't elaborate on what he meant, but Simon responded:
"I'd be happy to, Carlos."</TE>
<TE>   Yet questions on emotionally charged social issues pose a
challenge for Simon. Before the GOP primary, he appealed to
conservatives with his stands against gun control, abortion and gay
rights. But Simon has avoided those topics while courting moderates
and independents for the Nov. 5 election. On the radio, however, his
more aggressive hosts corner him into discussing them anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Mark Williams of KFBK-AM (1530) in Los Angeles asked
Simon if he would work to change laws that protect abortion rights.
Simon said he would not, but described himself nevertheless as
"pro-life."</TE>
<TE>   Williams also pressed Simon on immigration. Why, he asked, would
Simon allow undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses? "Aren't
they criminals by definition?" Williams asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes, they're here working, trying to raise families, and
trying to do the right thing, so let's do something," Simon said.
"Let's give them a path."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the questions Simon faces on the radio are sympathetic;
many of them target Davis. Hugh Hewitt, who calls Davis "the most
corrupt governor in history," tossed Simon questions about the "major
scandals" of the Davis administration on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Later that evening , Simon was on KSFO's Brian Wilson show. In the
course of asking Simon a question, Wilson called Davis a "doofus."</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of the show, Simon took a call from an exuberant
male listener.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill, kick ass," the caller told Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Simon replied, "That's a great way to end this up, Brian. I'm
happy to come on your program any time."</TE>

<HD>Faithful and Curious Alike Offer Tribute to the King</HD>
<DH>Elvis: Thousands gather at Graceland for 25th anniversary
of his death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Gray-haired women rolled through the drizzle, curled into
wheelchairs. Old men, too, limped along on canes or pushed oxygen
tanks before them. Students tugged on their dreadlocks. Kids who
weren't yet born when the King died rubbed tears from their cheeks
when they found themselves standing over his grave. Somber academics,
mystified tourists and sheepish enthusiasts tromped in a motley line
through the old house.</LD>
<LD>   These are the fans of Elvis Presley, thousands of sweaty pilgrims
caught up in a peculiarly American ritual. On the 25th anniversary of
his death, they have come to the banks of the Mississippi, gathering
to worship at a vast and unrepentantly gaudy shrine to the U.S.' most
beloved nondenominational saint. These are the visitors to Graceland.</LD>
<LD>   Presley used to fret over his death, used to fear he'd fall into
popular oblivion. But 25 years after he overdosed in his bathroom,
the King is still packing them in. Crowds still are looking for
salvation, escape or a cheap thrill in the rolling lawns of
Graceland.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a bit scary, isn't it?" asked John Hawkins, a 57-year-old
tourist from London. He glanced around, ran his eyes over the sea of
sideburns, sequins and jet-black shocks of hair. "He's their God,
isn't he?"</TE>
<TE>   The fans come to run their hands over the shag walls of his
basement, peek into the bedroom where his mother slept and watch
themselves climb down the staircase in the mirrored ceilings and
mirrored walls. They gaze at his first-grade crayons, his scuffed
Gibson guitar and his Army discharge papers. They stand in line for
anything, even to sign up for Elvis Presley credit cards.</TE>
<TE>   "You can feel his presence here," said Bea Williams, 58, of Bay
St. Louis, Miss. "As many times as I've been here, I've never lost
that feeling. I don't really understand the phenomenon myself, but
you feel it."</TE>
<TE>   Williams was just 15 when she heard "Heartbreak Hotel" on the
radio for the first time. She was a country girl from Mississippi,
growing up with no television and few amusements, and that was all
she needed to fall in love. She didn't know what Elvis looked like
for months--but it didn't matter. She had the voice.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how in your teen years you have all sorts of problems?"
she asked. "You could always lose yourself in Elvis."</TE>
<TE>   Time eventually came between Williams and Elvis. She grew up, got
married, had a son. Years slipped off. She lost her husband, opened a
stationery shop. And, slowly, her girlhood adoration reawakened.</TE>
<TE>   "I go to Graceland and I forget all my problems," she said. "I
feel like I'm 15 again, back in those happy days before all the bad
things started happening."</TE>
<TE>   Elvis is everywhere in Graceland--his voice, his face, his
imitators. But even here, the King stays somewhat hidden in
contradiction. Presley was by turns a soldier, a surfer and a lounge
lizard. He was a poor boy who made it big, but never forgot his mama.
He was also a rich man whose excesses corrupted, bloated and
eventually killed him. In his day he was a rebel and a scandal, but
nobody seems to remember that anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an Elvis for everyone," said Erika Doss, an art history
professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder and the author of
"Elvis Culture."</TE>
<TE>   "He is a saint and a sinner. In a very simplistic way, what you're
looking for can be satisfied in the multifaceted images of Elvis."</TE>
<TE>   Among his faithful, there are bitter disagreements about what sort
of man Presley was.</TE>
<TE>   "He had all sorts of affairs," offered Joe Hans, a 48-year-old
retiree from Lexington, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he was a family man," protested Miriam Espadas, 33,
from Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," snorted Hans. "When he was around 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Out in the parking lot, Mark Omdahl is rolling in from North
Dakota. "Elvis was like a big brother to me," said Omdahl, who was 13
when Elvis died. "He was the first musical note I ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   Omdahl was visiting South Korea years later when, on a whim, he
stopped into a tailor shop to have his first jumpsuit made. "Give me
the whitest material you got," he told the clerk. The first costume
was a flop--the fabric had no stretch, and Omdahl couldn't gyrate
properly.</TE>
<TE>   Through the years he's improved his selection. Now he's got plenty
of rhinestones, flared pants and capes. By day, Omdahl works at a
home for the disabled. By night, he pretends to be Elvis, huffing and
twisting and singing anywhere they'll let him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a perfect person," he said, climbing down from his truck.
"All by himself, he was the American dream."</TE>
<TE>   The cloying scent of hair pomade hung in the heat outside
Graceland on the eve of today's anniversary. And everywhere, there
were Elvises. Graying Elvises. Balding Elvises. Female Elvises. Asian
Elvises. Elvises on walking sticks. Elvises too young to recall the
man they are aping.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like its own kind of religion," said a 43-year-old
impersonator from Baltimore named Tom Connelly, eyeing his mother. "I
hate to say that in front of her, because she's very religious. But
it's true."</TE>
<TE>   A snow-haired woman steamed to his side. "Ohhh," she squealed,
poking the turquoise studs on his jacket. "Can I take a picture of
you?"</TE>
<TE>   Connelly's face dropped into the trademark smirk, he pivoted on
one foot and flicked his index fingers at the camera. "Thank you,
thank you," he intoned. "I'm a hunka-hunka burnin' love." And looking
on, his mother giggled.</TE>
<TE>   As the tour buses ferried them through the Graceland gate--a fence
whose stone is almost invisible under the thick scrawl of fans'
names--Elvis pipes through their headphones. "Welcome to my world,"
he croons, and the bus climbs past the lush lawn toward the front
door. "I'll be waiting there ... waiting just for you." A soft sigh
rose in the bus.</TE>
<TE>   When they wandered through the front door, those hooded eyes and
that swollen pout awaited them in the living room. They stared silent
as churchgoers at the chandeliers, the stained-glass peacocks, the
fireplace of marble and mirror--each one deaf to their neighbors,
lost in the private world of an audio tour. They ran their fingers
over the banister, caressed the doorknob, gazed in awe at the sofa.</TE>
<TE>   They trailed downstairs, upstairs, past the fake waterfall in the
jungle room, then out past the trophy cases and swimming pool. When
they reached the fountain at his grave, they tossed in a penny, and
muttered a wish. Then they turned to look.</TE>
<TE>   The tombs are all but lost under a brilliant heap of plastic and
paper. A stone Jesus stretches his arms. Teddy bears, fake flowers,
messages written in imperfect English. They looked down. They cried.
All these people, and they weren't making a sound. The headstone is
unequivocal: "He was a precious gift from God."</TE>
<TE>   They nodded. They sniffled. And then the fans turned and wandered
from the garden.</TE>

<LD>Freddy Garcia won for the second time since the All-Star break and
the Seattle Mariners used four unearned runs in the fourth inning to
edge the Boston Red Sox, 4-3, Thursday night at Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Guillen, Ichiro Suzuki and Jeff Cirillo had RBI singles as
Seattle increased its lead in the American League West to 1 1/2 games
over the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Cliff Floyd homered for Boston, which dropped six games behind the
New York Yankees in the AL East and 2 1/2 back of the Angels in the
wild-card race.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia (13-8) outpitched Casey Fossum as the Mariners took two of
three games in the series. Seattle opens a three-game set against the
Yankees on Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia pitched 5 2/3 innings, giving up three runs, seven hits and
four walks, with seven strikeouts. In seven starts since pitching in
the All-Star game on July 9, the right-hander is 2-3 with a 6.38
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Rhodes pitched 2 1/3scoreless innings, striking out four of
the seven batters he faced. Kazuhiro Sasaki worked the ninth for his
30th save in 35 opportunities, retiring Nomar Garciaparra, Manny
Ramirez and Floyd in order.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners took a 4-1 lead in the fourth. All their runs were
unearned because second baseman Rey Sanchez dropped shortstop
Garciaparra's short toss for an error on Ruben Sierra's potential
double-play grounder.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Martinez doubled to lead off the inning and John Olerud
walked before Sierra's grounder loaded the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Wilson tied it at 1 with a sacrifice fly. Guillen, Suzuki and
Cirillo then hit consecutive RBI singles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Kansas City 5--Raul Mondesi hit a two-run homer with
one out in the ninth inning and Bernie Williams went five for fiveas
the Yankees rallied for a victory at Kansas City, Mo., to complete a
three-game sweep over the Royals.</TE>
<TE>   Williams led off the ninth against Roberto Hernandez (1-3) with a
single, tying his career high with five hits. He moved to second on a
groundout, bringing up Mondesi, who hit his 23rd homer.</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Posada added an RBI single for the Yankees, who matched last
year's total by winning for the 17th time in their last at-bat and
moved a season-high 31 games over .500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 4, Cleveland 3--Andy Sheets hit a game-ending, three-run
homer with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning to lead the
Devil Rays past the Indians at St. Petersburg, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Karim Garcia's two-run homer had given the Indians a 3-1 lead in
the top of the ninth, the Devil Rays rallied.</TE>
<TE>   Aubrey Huff and Steve Cox had consecutive one-out singles against
Mark Wohlers (2-3), before Sheets' fourth homer of the season.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Setup Men Enjoy Their Experience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Except for closer Troy Percival, the relievers in the Angel bullpen
are a rather anonymous bunch.</LD>
<LD>   Consider Scot Shields, who once received his per diem money
addressed to Steve Shields.</LD>
<LD>   That would be the former Mighty Duck goalie. (Talk about Disney
synergy.)</LD>
<TE>   "I'd take his paycheck," Shields said.</TE>
<TE>   They might not have much name recognition, but the Angel relievers
have the best earned-run average in the American League at 3.08--and
the second best in the majors, behind only Atlanta's.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, of course, is a four-time All-Star. His 28 saves and
1.86 ERA are no surprise.</TE>
<TE>   But the setup crew was considered too inexperienced and too
right-handed to survive. Instead, they're thriving.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bill Stoneman watched as right-hander Paul Shuey
went from Cleveland to the Dodgers before the trading deadline. But
the Angels have done fine without him, and Shuey has struggled with
the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are making it work with right-handers Ben Weber (2.95),
Brendan Donnelly (1.95), Al Levine (3.00), Shields (2.83) and only
one lefty, former starter Scott Schoeneweis (5.26.)</TE>
<TE>   Weber, 32, normally a setup man, filled in ably when Percival was
on the disabled list, earning four saves in five outings.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, a rookie at 31, has retired 59 of the last 71 batters he
has faced, striking out 26 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Levine, 34, hasn't given up a run in eight appearances since
coming off the disabled list because of a sore shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Shields, a rookie at 27, has retired 15 of the 18 first batters he
has faced.</TE>
<TE>   And Schoeneweis, 28, is doing his job as the sole southpaw by
holding left-handed hitters to a .147 average--five for 34--since
joining the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason they've gotten away with having only one lefty
is, the lefty they have down there is really good," said injured
left-hander Dennis Cook, hoping to make it back from shoulder
problems by Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Weber dismissed the talk of inexperience.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're getting hitters out, you're getting hitters out. I
don't know any other way to put it," he said. "I know the big
question with our bullpen has been experience, but you look at 4 1/2
months of the season and we've been doing the job. To me, that's
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, just because we have the inexperience and we don't have
guys throwing 95 in middle relief, I think that has a lot to do with
it. People want to see guys blowing people away, and we don't do
that. Donnelly's doing it. He's been doing awesome. But I go out
there, I'm still throwing 90, 91. I'm getting ground balls.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you rather have a guy throwing 95 with a 5.00 ERA, or would
you rather have a guy throwing 90 with a 2-something ERA? To me,
that's a no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly said experience matters, but so does attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "The makeup we have in the bullpen, we have guys who have been
around. Maybe not at the major league level, but have pitched for a
while. Pitching's pitching. We're able to go out there and go right
after hitters. It starts with Percy on down. We see how he goes out
there, and we feed off that."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia is content.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the best arms that are available right now, and it just
so happens only one of them's left-handed," he said. "All those guys
give us balance. You know, there's only one left-handed bullet to
spend, but that late in the game, it's usually enough."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have won their last two games without Darin Erstad or
Tim Salmon in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   That's a lot of missing offensive juice, but both are likely to
return sometime during the weekend series against Cleveland after an
extra day of rest Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad, out because of fatigue in his right leg, made his first
two pinch-hit appearances of the season Tuesday and Wednesday and
delivered run-scoring hits both times.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who has sat out four games because of a bruised left hand
after being hit by a pitch, will test his hand before today's game
before deciding whether he's ready to play.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I return from a vacation amid the idyllic landscape of Wyoming and
Montana only to re-encounter the characteristic chaos of baseball's
labor landscape</LD>
<LD>   As the dirty laundry languishes in my suitcase, a wary union,
still believing the owners intend to lock out the players after the
World Series and/or unilaterally implement new work rules, is
expected to further cloud and confuse the collective bargaining
process today, taking a step it delayed taking Monday in the hope
that another week of negotiations would put the sides closer to an
agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Considering that the eight previous negotiations have all ended in
a work stoppage, that common sense is a lost aspect in this process,
that the union distrusts the owners and that there are some owners
who still believe the union can be broken, what ensued wasn't
unexpected.</LD>
<TE>   Starting Tuesday, there was little movement on the contentious
issue of a payroll tax and virtually no negotiation at all.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, although it wasn't definite, union leaders were leaning
Thursday to recommending that its executive board, meeting by phone
today, approve an Aug. 30 strike date.</TE>
<TE>   What would that mean--aside from the reality that Shakespeare was
centuries ahead of himself when he recommended a plague on both
houses?</TE>
<TE>   Well, OK, setting a strike date doesn't mean it will come down to
a strike on that date.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't pushing the envelope to believe a settlement is still
possible.</TE>
<TE>   There is a measure of civility and compromise that was absent in
1994, when the players went out on Aug. 12 and didn't return for 232
days, and then only because a federal judge found the owners guilty
of illegal labor practice.</TE>
<TE>   This time, there is a foundation that wasn't there in '94.</TE>
<TE>   The sides have reached agreement on minimum salary and the benefit
plan, and the union has made concessions on steroid testing, a
worldwide draft and increased revenue sharing. The union is also
negotiating on a payroll tax that it philosophically opposes and
considers comparable to a salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   All of those positives aside, history suggests, as a lawyer close
to the process put it, that "it will probably get uglier before it
gets better."</TE>
<TE>   There are informed people, in fact, who believe that the setting
of a strike date is exactly what the owners want, triggering, as one
said, the "court of public opinion to descend on a union that has
never been intimidated, in a mistaken belief it will pressure the
players into giving the owners a better deal."</TE>
<TE>   In what has been an ongoing poker game by the two sides, these
people also contend that Rob Manfred, baseball's lead lawyer, has
studiously prepared for implementation by painting a portrait of
good-faith bargaining with his positive comments, and prepared for
the legal challenges to implementation by taking care as to what
proposal he has on the table and when.</TE>
<TE>   With all of that, Manfred is strictly the front man for
Commissioner Bud Selig, who continues to call the shots, hasn't
appeared upset that the union may set a strike date, and remains
under the influence, according to sources (and recent accusations by
New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner in a New York Times story),
of a militant group of small-revenue owners.</TE>
<TE>   They include John Moores of San Diego, David Glass of Kansas City,
Drayton McLane of Houston, Carl Pohlad of Minnesota and the
re-emerging hawk and puppet master, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago
White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   That group, sources said, has been known to conduct its own
conference calls, devoid of other owners.</TE>
<TE>   If the players set an Aug. 30 strike date today, will Selig and
his kitchen cabinet permit Manfred to negotiate a compromise on the
key issue of a luxury tax between now and then?</TE>
<TE>   There is no certainty. The owners initially proposed a 50% tax on
all payroll above $98 million. They have since moved to about $100
million, while the union is in the area of $135 million (an area
occupied only by the Yankees) at a much lower tax rate. That the
union is willing to negotiate a payroll tax at all is a major
development and recognition that the owners will not ratify any deal
that does not include a salary restraint.</TE>
<TE>   However, the argument over tax rate and threshold produced
virtually no meaningful negotiations Wednesday and Thursday, and no
talks are scheduled today.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a lawyer close to the process said the union will not
strip the key salary driving clubs, such as the Yankees, Dodgers and
Boston Red Sox, of their market rights by agreeing to a debilitating
tax on top of their increased revenue sharing burden.</TE>
<TE>   It is inconceivable, of course, that an industry that produces
$3.6 billion in revenue can't find a way to divide it short of a
possible work stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   It is inconceivable that it has taken this long, but then Selig
spoiled the off-season with his doomed contraction scenario, after he
had called off secret and promising (in the union's view, at least)
negotiations last summer when he stripped the respected and
conciliatory Paul Beeston, baseball's since-deposed chief operating
officer, of any authority.</TE>
<TE>   Now?</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe a strike date will pressure the sides into a
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, despite Fox covering its possible postseason TV losses,
enough owners owe enough in stadium debts to bring about a
settlement, and enough banks are owed enough to make it clear they
won't tolerate a stoppage.</TE>
<TE>   The mid-August standings, with 17 teams more than 10 games behind,
reflect the competitive disparity that management claims needs to be
addressed with a new system. However, baseball's finances remain a
murky proposition. Congress reacted to Selig's financial figures with
skepticism, Forbes magazine mocked them and former New York Met
co-owner Nelson Doubleday, in a suit since settled, recently accused
Selig of doctoring the books to create "phantom losses." It has been
a difficult summer for the commissioner, and now he and his cronies
must decide how hard a line they are going to draw on the tax issue.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, beyond the risk inherent in another stoppage, he and
a union whose membership averages $2.4 million in salary must weigh
the fans' reaction if there is a shutdown amid the nation's current
economic climate, and if that shutdown is still in place on Sept. 11,
the first anniversary of the terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   It is safe to say that the world has changed since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to baseball's labor landscape, there is little else
that can be said safely.</TE>

<HD>Reds Trade for Estes to Help in Playoff Bid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their playoff chances slipping away, the Cincinnati Reds
acquired starter Shawn Estes from the New York Mets on Thursday for
two minor leaguers and two players to be named.</LD>
<LD>   The Mets also agreed to pay the remainder of Estes'
contract--$1,524,592--because Red ownership won't increase the
payroll. Estes, 29, agreed to a $6.2 million, one-year deal in
February.</LD>
<LD>   The Reds led the National League Central for 51 days earlier this
season but were overtaken by St. Louis on June 18. They traded for
starters Ryan Dempster and Brian Moehler in July, but they've gone a
combined 3-5 in 10 starts with an 8.01 earned-run average.</LD>
<TE>   Texas' Kenny Rogers also vetoed a trade in July, saying he wanted
to finish the season with the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   The Red pitching staff has been horrible of late, giving up six or
more runs eight times in nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Estes was 4-9 with a 4.55 ERA for the Mets, who acquired him in a
trade with San Francisco in December. His main problem throughout his
career has been control--he averages roughly one walk for every two
innings pitched.</TE>
<TE>   New York acquired left-hander Pedro Feliciano and outfielder Elvin
Andujar from the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jimmy Anderson, the Pittsburgh Pirates' most
experienced starting pitcher, was removed from the rotation by
Manager Lloyd McClendon.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is we have to have results. You have to get it
done. If you can't, we're going to go out and find someone else who
can get it done," McClendon said. "This isn't a country club. This is
a professional baseball team. Guys have to perform."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson (8-13, 5.70 ERA) wasn't expecting the demotion and wasn't
happy with it.</TE>
<TE>   "It really doesn't make a lot of sense. I don't make the
decisions. I just have to live with it and I'll try to do the best I
can out of the bullpen," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians put closer Bob Wickman on the 15-day
disabled list because of a strained tendon in his right elbow.
Wickman flew to Los Angeles to have the elbow examined by Dr. Lewis
Yocum. He had pitched only once after being put on the disabled list
on July 23.... The San Diego Padres put right-hander Bobby J. Jones
on the 15-day DL because of a strained lower back and recalled
left-hander Mike Bynum from triple-A Portland. Bynum will make his
major league debut Saturday.</TE>

<LD>CHASKA, Minn.--So, what's worse? A three-hour storm with thunder that
sounds as if someone is dropping bowling balls on your roof?</LD>
<LD>   Or would it be Tiger Woods on your tail at a major championship?</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it's all a matter of perspective. It all depends on
whether you're the one in the house or the one with a legitimate
chance to beat the odds and beat Woods in a major.</LD>
<TE>   To paraphrase Tiger's line in his Buick commercial, "What, you
were expecting Igor?"</TE>
<TE>   No, only the lightning. And that was some serious stuff that was
zippering the sky over Hazeltine National Golf Club on opening day,
just as it was a serious Tiger playing the first round of the PGA
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, Woods isn't in the lead, but Tiger is still close
enough to cause whiplash to the guys in front of him who are all
swiveling their heads to check his position.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, they have every reason to feel that way.</TE>
<TE>   The record shows that Woods is three shots behind Jim Furyk and
Fred Funk, who can be described simply: nice guys, no major
championships.</TE>
<TE>   The record would also show that Woods finds himself in decent
position with 54 holes to go in the last major championship of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   As we know, Woods won the first two and has set his course toward
becoming the first person to win three majors in the same year twice.
He did it in 2000 when he won the U.S. Open by 15 shots, the British
Open by eight shots and the PGA Championship in a playoff.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's trying to complete a different triple play--the Masters,
U.S. Open and PGA--which no one has done before.</TE>
<TE>   This is what Tiger is about these days. His success rate is so
high, he must amuse us by the degree of difficulty in how he wins.</TE>
<TE>   Check out his record in the big-time events: in the last 12
majors, Woods has won seven of them.</TE>
<TE>   So here we are at the PGA Championship, which accounts for the
second and fifth of Woods' eight major titles.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some of the guys ahead of him are still looking for
their second.</TE>
<TE>   It is a select group, noteworthy for the fact that while Woods has
gone on to another level, these players, for whatever reason, haven't
made that first major title a steppingstone to a second or maybe a
third.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Janzen is tied for fifth, one shot ahead of Woods, and he has
two U.S. Open titles, in 1993 and in 1998. But you get the feeling
that at 37, Janzen's days of hauling off the big silverware are over.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III is tied with Janzen, and his drought has been even
longer. It has been five years since Love won the PGA Championship at
Winged Foot, his first and only major title. He has seven top 10s
since, but he's 38 and his time is running out.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Sluman, 44, is in contention with a 70 in the first round and
his only major was the 1988 PGA Championship. Tom Lehman, who shot a
71, won the 1996 British Open and has been blanked in majors since.
He's 43.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, neither Furyk nor Funk has won a major, so it's
possible that Woods could be seeing an open field in front of  him.</TE>
<TE>   How Woods played in the first round was hardly overpowering, but
it was good enough for him that he spent only 30 minutes on the range
afterward. What he was concerned about was his driver. He used it
seven times and put the ball on the fairway twice. Any other player
does that and we're talking a 75, but Woods is not any other player.</TE>
<TE>   There are four par fives at Hazeltine and Tiger made birdie on
only one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Woods says he knows what's wrong with his swing, which has to be
comforting to him and upsetting to everyone trying to beat him. The
problem is his takeaway, his backswing. All he needs is some time to
get it right. He has three more rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Once again today, Woods will tee it up with defending champion
David Toms and British Open champion Ernie Els. It was a
much-anticipated grouping Thursday, but it was also one that fell far
short of expectations. The threesome combined for a four-over
score--Toms had a 77 and Els a par 72 to go with Woods one-under 71.</TE>
<TE>   The real score in this tournament is 155-1. There are 155 guys and
there is Tiger Woods. Maybe that's not fair, but you can be sure it's
the only score Tiger is concerned with.</TE>
<TE>   After he shot an 81 in the third round at Muirfield and ultimately
failed in his quest to win the British Open, it was suggested to
Tiger that he had lost any reason to win at Hazeltine. Woods treated
the idea the same way he would if someone had asked him if he would
stuff his prized video game collection down the trash compactor in
disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Uh, no, dude. For everyone in contention here, major winner or
not, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Like everyone else, Tiger
can't win it on Thursday. That happens on Sunday. It might not even
happen to him this time, but that's not the way he acted once the
skies cleared.</TE>

<LD>Monday's decision by major league baseball players to postpone
setting a strike date is no reason to canonize them, says Bernie
Lincicome of the Rocky Mountain News.</LD>
<LD>   "My word," Lincicome wrote, "you would think [they] had decided to
give blood, fund orphanages, fight wildfires, something brave and
noble. They are, by unanimous decision, going to keep playing
baseball. At least until the end of the week.</LD>
<LD>   "Seen in this selfless and rousing act is hope that stupidity will
not kill the summer and the New York Yankees' chances of winning
another World Series.</LD>
<TE>   "This is like applauding a glutton for agreeing to clean his
plate."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only USC football player in the last 20
seasons to have rushed for more than 1,200 yards?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Keeping it real: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle,
calling Coach Eric Musselman of the Golden State Warriors the best
new hire in the NBA:</TE>
<TE>   "If for no other reason, he's no retread and has shown a flair.
But, please, no more stories about how hard he works. My masseuse
works hard too, but she's not going to help the Warriors."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked: A recent Sports Illustrated article listing the 10
biggest upsets in college football history left out one of the
biggest. In 1931, USC overcame a 14-0 fourth-quarter deficit and
defeated Notre Dame, 16-14, on a late field goal by Johnny Baker at
South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish, unbeaten in 26 games, had been heavily favored and when
the Trojans returned to Los Angeles they were greeted by a crowd
estimated at 300,000 for a ticker-tape parade downtown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Color him gone: Tim Kawakami in the San Jose Mercury News, on
Sammy Sosa's saying he might leave the Chicago Cubs after next season
if they don't put together a winner: "That's officially called the
hell-freezes-over opt-out clause."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Insider information? Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel: "I'm
not saying which baseball team will be contracted, but let me put it
this way: Martha Stewart has just unloaded all of her Devil Rays'
stock."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this date in 1987, 18-year-old Steffi Graf
defeated Chris Evert, 6-3, 6-4, to win the Virginia Slims of Los
Angeles in Manhattan Beach, taking over the No. 1 spot in the world
rankings for the first time. She became the first player other than
Evert or Martina Navratilova to hold down the top position since
Tracy Austin in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ricky Ervins, who ran for 1,395 yards in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Joe Carter, hero of the 1993 World Series for the
Blue Jays, is now a color commentator for the Cubs on WGN and,
judging by what happened Monday, probably should confine his comments
to baseball.</TE>
<TE>   During a game between the Cubs and Houston Astros at Wrigley
Field, former Chicago Bear quarterback Jim McMahon sang "Take Me Out
to the Ballgame" during the seventh-inning stretch. Afterward, he was
interviewed by Carter, who might have been trying to stir up an old
Super Bowl controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you stay in touch with Pete Rozelle?" Carter asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be hard to do, considering he's been dead for several
years," McMahon said of the former commissioner, who died in 1996.</TE>

<HD>Nuggets Interested in Sparks' Cooper</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Spark Coach Michael Cooper is being considered for a job as assistant
coach with the NBA's Denver Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   According to sources, Denver General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe has
had informal talks with Cooper's representative regarding his
interest and availability.</LD>
<LD>   The Nuggets are tentatively planning a news conference next week
to announce the promotion of assistant Jeff Bzdelik to the
head-coaching job.</LD>
<TE>   Cooper, who is here with the defending champion Sparks for their
WNBA playoff series against the Seattle Storm, would neither confirm
nor deny the report.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm under contract with the Sparks and I'm happy," said Cooper,
who has been the Sparks' coach since 1999. "As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the L.A. Sparks' coach going into next season."</TE>
<TE>   Cooper is 81-15 as the Sparks' coach and has won three consecutive
Western Conference regular season championships and last season's
WNBA title. His contract was extended for two more seasons before
this season, but there is a provision in the contract allowing him to
leave to take an NBA job.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year Cooper, 46, was a candidate for the
head-coaching position at the University of New Mexico, where he
played college basketball, but he withdrew his name from
consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Bzdelik, 49, became the leading candidate for the Nuggets' job
after NBA assistant coaches Donn Nelson and Del Harris of Dallas,
Eddie Jordan of New Jersey and Phil Johnson of Utah withdrew their
names.</TE>
<TE>   Bzdelik is considered an excellent defensive coach and defense is
also Cooper's forte. He was a five-time all-defensive first team
selection during his 11-year NBA career.</TE>

<HD>Dodger Victory Is Well Done</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Umpire inadvertently helps them, and Lo Duca
blocks plate for final out in 1-0 win over Expos.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers have had their share of beefs with umpires this season,
but they received the officiating equivalent of filet mignon Thursday
night, when a fluke play involving third base umpire Tim Timmons
denied the Montreal Expos the tying run in the eighth inning.</LD>
<LD>   But the real meat-and-potatoes play came in the bottom of the
ninth, when blue-collar catcher Paul Lo Duca survived a bang-bang
collision, fielding Shawn Green's throw from right field and tagging
Henry Mateo for the game's final out to put a thrilling end to the
Dodgers' 1-0 victory before 10,985 in Olympic Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   With two out, Mateo at second and Dodger closer Eric Gagne trying
to protect a one-run lead, Jose Vidro, who was robbed of an
eighth-inning double by Timmons, singled sharply to right.</LD>
<TE>   Green, who struck out three times in four hitless at-bats, charged
and made a strong one-hop throw to the plate. The ball and Mateo
arrived at the same time, and Mateo lowered his shoulder into Lo
Duca, but Lo Duca somehow caught the ball, swiped the tag and held
onto the ball to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing in my mind was don't let him get to the plate--if
the throw was on line, he was going to have to run me over," Lo Duca
said. "I was so pumped up [after the play] I didn't feel [the effects
of the collision]. Then, I started seeing stars."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were counting them.</TE>
<TE>   There was starting pitcher Omar Daal, who gave up four hits in
seven shutout innings to become the Dodgers' fourth 10-game winner
this season. In his last five starts, Daal is 3-0 with a 1.89
earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   There was reliever Jesse Orosco, who got Troy O'Leary to fly to
center with the bases loaded to end the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   There was Green, who showed his power is not limited to his bat by
recording his fifth outfield assist of the season, and the 5-foot-8,
185-pound Lo Duca, whose no-guts, no-glory approach, honed under
Angel Manager and former Dodger plate-blocker Mike Scioscia in the
Dodger farm system, saved his team's victory.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as the Dodgers are handing out game balls, they
shouldn't forget Timmons.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Paul Quantrill relieved Daal to start the eighth, and
Vidro sliced a grounder inside the third-base bag, a shot that looked
like a sure double before it hit Timmons about 20 feet beyond the
base and stopped on the spot. Timmons was pointing toward center
field, signifying the ball was fair, and jumping to avoid the ball at
the same time, and he couldn't get out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball rules dictate an umpire is in play, so the ball was live.
Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre retrieved it, and a confused Vidro
stopped after taking a wide turn around first. Beltre made a long
throw across the diamond in time to nail Vidro at first for the first
out.</TE>
<TE>   "Vidro was just as confused as I was," Dodger first baseman Tyler
Houston said. "I thought it was foul, and then Beltre is standing
there with the ball. [Vidro] put his head down--he thought it was a
double all the way. He had to be confused, because you don't see that
play all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Cabrera then doubled to right, a hit that would easily
have scored Vidro from second. Quantrill walked Vladimir Guerrero and
struck out Andres Galarraga for the second out.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill then walked Fernando Tatis on a full-count pitch to load
the bases, and Manager Jim Tracy summoned Orosco to face O'Leary,
whose two-run, eighth-inning homer off Gagne beat the Dodgers on
Tuesday night. O'Leary lifted a long fly ball to the gap in
left-center, but center fielder Dave Roberts raced over to make the
catch.</TE>
<TE>   Then in the ninth, it was the Dodgers who bailed out Gagne instead
of Gagne bailing out the Dodgers, as Green and Lo Duca combined on a
defensive play that gave the excitable Gagne his 41st save.</TE>
<TE>   "I was gonna tackle Lo Duca after that, but he's too small," Gagne
said. "It was a great throw, right on the money, and Lo Duca was
ready to get tackled. He could have gotten crushed, and he didn't
even flinch. That was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Green said he simply "threw the ball as hard as I could. The
[artificial] turf helped. You can make a hard, low throw, and the
turf gives you extra length on the bounce. You know you're going to
have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers scored in the third inning when Mark Grudzielanek led
off with a single to right and Alex Cora singled to center off Expo
starter Javier Vazquez. Daal dropped a perfect sacrifice bunt toward
third, advancing the runners, and Roberts, with the infield back, hit
an RBI groundout to second.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were on the wrong end of two blown calls that were
costly in losses to Arizona on July 11 and 13, and they were
victimized by umpire Dan Iassogna's ejection of Gagne in the ninth
inning of a 6-4 loss to Cincinnati, a ruling that the vice president
of umpiring said Iassogna erred on.</TE>
<TE>   There were no complaints about the officiating Thursday night,
though.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a tremendous game, one you love to win and one that's
tough to lose, but we've had our fair share of those," Tracy said.
"We had virtually no room for error, and it went down to the last
play."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Brown Taken Off DL</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Kevin Brown was activated off the disabled list Thursday and put in
the Dodger bullpen in hopes that the right-hander can work his way
back into peak form--and eventually the rotation--with several
lower-stress relief appearances.</LD>
<LD>   But Brown was nearly thrown into the fire Thursday night, warming
up in the bottom of the eighth inning with the bases loaded and the
Dodgers leading by a run. Jesse Orosco got out of the jam, though,
and Brown was not used in the Dodgers' 1-0 victory over the Expos.</LD>
<LD>   "I wouldn't have wanted to use him in that situation, but there
are times when I may have to," Manager Jim Tracy said. "Had Jesse not
gotten out of it, I would have gone to Brown, because I can't overuse
[Paul] Shuey."</LD>
<TE>   Neither Tracy nor Brown, who underwent surgery for a herniated
disk in his lower back June 11 and hasn't pitched since May 26, would
speculate how long the bullpen duty would last, but the Dodgers have
no intention of turning Brown into a full-time reliever.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the right decision for Kevin, for the team, for the
organization," Tracy said. "We can't just jump on his shoulders and
ride him into October. We have to find out how he's going to do, have
him test the waters first rather than start him."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Brown, who is in the fourth year of a seven-year,
$105-million contract, will return to the rotation when he finds "a
mental comfort level, so that he feels good where he's at."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who also underwent surgery to repair a torn tendon in his
right elbow last September, seemed open to the idea of relieving,
even though he has made only one relief appearance as a Dodger and
three in his 14-year career.</TE>
<TE>   "I plan to start again, but they don't want to hang me out to
dry," said Brown, who is 2-3 with a 4.06 earned-run average in nine
starts this season. "Stamina is not an issue. It's a matter of facing
guys at this level and doing so without having to pitch six or seven
innings right off the bat."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said his best-case scenario for using Brown would be in
lopsided games, but as he showed Thursday night, he won't refrain
from using him in critical situations. He'll probably enter games at
the start of innings, instead of with runners on base, and Tracy said
he won't have Brown warm up more than twice in one night.</TE>
<TE>   Though Brown struggled with his command and rhythm in recent
bullpen workouts, he said his arm feels the way it used to before
elbow problems hampered him throughout 2001. "This is the best I've
felt since 2000," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Brown on the roster, the Dodgers put struggling
reliever Giovanni Carrara on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to
Sunday, because of a strained muscle in his right forearm, an injury
that is not believed to be serious.</TE>
<TE>   In his last three outings, Carrara gave up a two-run homer to
Philadelphia's Mike Lieberthal on Saturday, he hit two batters with
the bases loaded to score the go-ahead runs in a 7-5 loss to the
Phillies on Aug. 5 and gave up a tying, two-run double to
Cincinnati's Jason LaRue in the ninth inning of a 6-4 loss to the
Reds on Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Carrara, who is 6-3 with a 3.62 ERA and has a team-high five blown
saves, informed Dodger trainers of his condition Sunday. The
right-hander warmed up during Wednesday night's game but didn't
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan, sidelined since last Friday because of
a protrusion in his lower back, rejoined the Dodgers on Thursday,
taking soft toss and hitting off a tee.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to return to the lineup for a three-game series against
the New York Mets beginning tonight, "but I don't want to set myself
back," he said. "If it has to be 15 days, they can put me on the DL
and backdate it."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's condition improved after an epidural injection to
alleviate the pain. Jordan, who missed two-thirds of the 1997 season
because of a bulging disk in his lower back, has missed the Dodgers'
last six games.</TE>
<TE>   "My hope is that what they saw on the MRI test is the old injury I
had in 1997," Jordan said. "That protrusion was already there.
Hopefully the shot knocked it out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After sitting out Wednesday's game against Expo right-hander
Bartolo Colon, Dodger first baseman Eric Karros did not start again
Thursday against right-hander Javier Vazquez. But Karros did not
object to being replaced by Tyler Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm two for 14 against Vazquez, Tyler has some good numbers [five
for 12] against him, and I've never faced Colon," Karros said. "It
makes all the sense in the world."</TE>

against Estes. The Mets have lost five games in a row overall and
eight in a row at home. Catcher Mike Piazza has sat out the last

is on the disabled list because of a strained rib-cage muscle.</TE>

<HD>Cohen Set to Drop Longtime Coach</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Laguna Niguel teenager leaving Nicks for
Russians Tarasova and Morozov.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Figure skater Sasha Cohen of Laguna Niguel, whose balletic grace
propelled her to a second-place finish at this year's U.S.
Championships and fourth place at the Salt Lake City Olympics, has
left longtime coach John Nicks to work with Tatiana Tarasova and
Nikolai Morozov in Newington, Conn.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen will announce the switch today in a conference call with
reporters.</LD>
<LD>   Tarasova's most recent triumph was guiding Alexei Yagudin to the
men's gold medal at Salt Lake City. She previously coached Olympic
and world medalists Ilia Kulik, Irina Rodnina and Alexander Zaitsev,
Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponamarenko, Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor
Kraatz, Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio, and Oksana
Grischuk and Evgeny Platov.</LD>
<TE>   She and Morozov are known for devising compelling choreography, a
chore Cohen and Nicks had handled. She's also known for her political
pull, a key asset in a sport swayed by personal influence and based
on subjective judging. Two fellow Russians, Alexander Lakernik and
Alexandr Gorshkov, head the International Skating Union's powerful
technical committee and ice dance committee, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Nicks and Cohen had consulted Tarasova and Morozov this summer and
agreed Cohen would occasionally polish her programs under their
guidance. However, Cohen apparently decided training with them
full-time would accelerate her progress.</TE>
<TE>   Nicks declined to comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's some sort of announcement [today] and I'd just as
soon leave it at that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who recently completed high school and will turn 18 in
October, could not be reached for comment. Her mother, Galina, a
native of Ukraine who moved to the U.S. as a teenager, said she was
wrapping up the business affairs of her recently deceased father and
could not talk about her daughter's skating before today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ice dancer Marina Anissina, implicated in the alleged plot to fix
the pairs and ice dance events at the Salt Lake City Games, and
partner Gwendal Peizerat were questioned by the French Olympic
Committee about their knowledge of the scheme. Her agent, Liz DeSevo,
said Anissina has been advised to hire an attorney in the U.S., but
added that her client has not been subpoenaed by U.S. authorities.</TE>

<LD>One of the better Del Mar specialists of recent memory will be back
in action this afternoon. Stormy Jack, a 5-year-old son of Bertrando,
will make his first start since March 3 in the sixth, a $70,000
optional claimer at six furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Owned and bred by Jack and Florence Arnold and trained by Bob
Baffert, Stormy Jack has started five times at Del Mar. He has won
four of those races and was third in his loss. He was beaten going a
flat mile and he is a far better horse around one turn.</LD>
<LD>   If Stormy Jack, who will be ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, is to
make a successful return, he'll have to beat, among others, another
veteran who has done well by the beach.</LD>
<TE>   Lebontempsroulet, a 5-year-old gray son of At The Threshold, has
won two of four at Del Mar, most recently in his first start of the
meet on Aug. 1. Owned by Don Barber and Jose DeLima and trained by
DeLima, Lebontempsroulet won by two lengths at 3-1 in a race that
included favored Mighty David.</TE>
<TE>   David Flores will again ride the Kentucky-bred, who will break
from post 2 in the field of six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Dream Machine, who was second in a division of
the Oceanside Stakes in his U.S. debut on July 24, will try for his

<KH>MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL'S LABOR TROUBLES</KH>
<HD>Players Ready to Set the Date</HD>
<DH>Negotiations: No progress is made, and union is expected to
establish a strike deadline today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Entrenched at opposite extremes of the main economic issue in stalled
baseball labor talks, management and players Thursday apparently
moved closer to triggering the sport's ninth work stoppage since
1972.</LD>
<LD>   Negotiations hit a wall for the second time in as many days over a
payroll tax, producing more skepticism about a process that sources
on both sides said probably won't produce an agreement before a
deadline today that could escalate the conflict.</LD>
<LD>   With owners and the Major League Baseball Players Assn. still far
apart on the concept and application of a payroll tax, the union's
executive board is expected to set a strike deadline that might
further encumber bargaining.</LD>
<TE>   "It wasn't good today," said Atlanta Brave pitcher Tom Glavine,
the National League player representative. "They made another
proposal that was fairly meaningless. We're basically sitting back,
waiting for them to give us a serious offer."</TE>
<TE>   The executive board, scheduled to reconvene for a 10 a.m. EDT
conference call, had been prepared to announce a walkout date Monday
in Chicago. However, it postponed because of management's suggestion
that an agreement could be completed soon if talks continued without
adding another wrench to the process.</TE>
<TE>   But the sides are now further apart about the tax, which
management deems essential to gain a minimal form of salary restraint
on the high-revenue clubs that drive the market and, in the view of
many owners, prevent competitive balance.</TE>
<TE>   Management did not soften its stance in two negotiating sessions
Thursday, and the executive board was on the verge of making a strike
date public.</TE>
<TE>   The union has considered Aug. 30, Sept. 2 and Sept. 16 to stop
playing, and many players are now targeting Aug. 30--the Friday of
Labor Day weekend. Negotiations have at times moved steadily since
resuming in earnest after the All-Star break, but the sides haven't
approached common ground on the core issue that threatens to derail
the process.</TE>
<TE>   Management only a few days ago had continued to characterize talks
in optimistic language, but players don't view things similarly and
are prepared to take action.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a gut feeling they'll probably set a date tomorrow,"
Houston Astro player representative Gregg Zaun said. "They haven't
gotten anywhere the last three days, which to me was somewhat
surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Management has moved slightly from its original proposal for a 50%
tax on payrolls over $98 million, increasing their threshold to a
little more than $100 million, sources said. The union tax threshold
is in the $139-million range, and the New York Yankees are the only
club projected to surpass that total next season.</TE>
<TE>   Owners, insisting that the next agreement include a viable
mechanism to slow escalating player salaries, were perplexed by the
union's decision to present a plan that does not address more than
one team. Under management's proposal, as many as seven teams would
be assessed the tax in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   With owners seeking a legal method to promote spending restraint,
attempting to regain control lost in decades of previous collective
bargaining without collusion, the union is especially sensitive to
what it views as a two-tiered system--a salary cap by another name.
It fears that increased revenue sharing and a wide-ranging payroll
tax would siphon too much money from high-revenue teams, in effect
creating a cap.</TE>
<TE>   The union views payroll tax as a component of revenue sharing,
another means of transferring money from high-revenue to low-revenue
clubs, maintaining they work in conjunction only to redistribute
revenue. The union is prepared to make further concessions on revenue
sharing, but not unless owners abandon their proposal for a payroll
tax that would affect many teams.</TE>
<TE>   Union head Don Fehr, rallying the troops during a recent tour of
all 30 clubs, preached the need to oppose a stiff luxury tax. It
appears everyone is adhering to his message as the deadline
approaches.</TE>
<TE>   "We made an offer to try to reign in the Yankees and maybe one or
two others," Glavine said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead, they want to affect six or seven others immediately, and
maybe six or seven more on the periphery. That's a salary cap."</TE>

<HD>Harlem Cleared to Play in Series</HD>
<DH>Little League: Team provides documents refuting charges
that it violated residency rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The Harlem Little League team was cleared to play in the World Series
on Thursday after providing documents showing that its players met
residency requirements.</LD>
<LD>   Little League officials partly blamed the leadership of the New
York City team for not submitting the proper documents before the
regular season. But the team has since provided paperwork refuting
accusations it was ineligible because some players did not live
within the league's boundaries.</LD>
<LD>   "These kids weren't recruited from anywhere. They weren't brought
in from another district or league. They're home-grown," said Stephen
Keener, Little League's president and CEO.</LD>
<TE>   Last summer's Little League World Series was tainted by scandal
when a pitcher from the Bronx, N.Y., Danny Almonte, was discovered to
be too old to play. Almonte's team was forced to forfeit its
third-place finish after officials determined he was 14 instead of
12.</TE>
<TE>   Keener said there was no comparison between the Rolando Paulino
team's actions and those of Harlem Little League. "Harlem did not
attempt to cheat to get here. Rolando Paulino did," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This year's World Series is scheduled to begin today. The Harlem
team advanced by winning the Mid-Atlantic Regional.</TE>
<TE>   Morris McWilliams, manager of Harlem Little League, said he had
"no feeling of bitterness at all" about the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Little League did what they had to do," he said. "We provided
them with the documentation, and they made their decision. We're
ready to play ball."</TE>
<TE>   A protest lodged earlier Thursday by Lehigh Little League of
Bethlehem, Pa., which was defeated by the Harlem team in a qualifying
game Tuesday night, was denied, the league said.</TE>
<TE>   In ruling that the Harlem team would remain eligible, Little
League laid some of the blame at the feet of the team's managers for
keeping disorganized records.</TE>
<TE>   "It was clear to the tournament committee that the leadership of
the Harlem Little League failed in its responsibility to gather and
submit the proper documents to Little League Baseball International
before the start of the regular season," officials said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   "These documents, if submitted before or during the regular
season, would have been acceptable at that time in establishing the
eligibility of the players in question."</TE>
<TE>   Thee investigation began after Newsday reported Wednesday that as
many as three players lived outside the Harlem league's district.</TE>
<TE>   Although each Little League has distinct geographic boundaries,
there are circumstances under which a player can play outside the
area where he lives.</TE>
<TE>   Officials declined to outline the specifics of the players' living
arrangements Thursday. They said one of the three investigated
clearly lived inside the Harlem Little League District. Two others
had moved outside the league's boundaries but had been playing in
Harlem Little League for at least four years, so they were entitled
to continue participating.</TE>
<TE>   Little League officials said the documentation used to uphold
Harlem's eligibility was provided by the disputed players' families
and others who know the players. Family members also were
interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Following last year's scandal, Little League strengthened its
rules for documenting the age and residence of players.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Billy Hamill of Monrovia put on a clinic Wednesday night in the first
round of the American Motorcyclist Assn. National Championship
Speedway Series in San Bernardino.</LD>
<LD>   Hamill, matched in five rounds against every other rider in the
16-man field, showed why he is the reigning national champion.</LD>
<LD>   He won all five heats for a perfect score of 15 to advance to the
A-main. He then beat Greg Hancock of Balboa, Billy Janniro of Vallejo
and Eddie Castro of Ojai to take the lead in the three-race series,
which continues tonight at Auburn.</LD>
<TE>   "The national championship, next to the world championship, is the
most coveted title for me," Hamill, who won the 1996 world
championship, said after the four-lap race on the wide eighth-mile
dirt track. "I want to win this more than anything."</TE>
<TE>   With his first-round victory, and having earned an additional
point for being the top scorer, Hamill has 21 Grand Prix points in
the richest event in American speedway history. The purse was more
than $12,000, and figures to top more than $33,000 for the series.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock, the 1997 world champion, earned 18 points, Janniro 16 and
Castro 14. Costa Mesa rider Scott Brant, the B-main winner, is in
fifth place with 12 points, and Reno rider Chris Manchester has 11.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be hard to catch Hamill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's over unless something happens to him or his bike," said
Riverside rider Gary Hicks, who won the C-main, good for eight
points. "It's between the three guys on top, unless there's a
miracle."</TE>
<TE>   The three on top are all riding this season in Europe. Hamill is
captain of the Coventry Bees in the British Elite League, and Janniro
is one of his teammates. A British League rule change, and a late
decision by Coventry in which it chose Hamill over Hancock, left
Hancock out of the British League this season.</TE>
<TE>   Hancock is instead racing in Poland and Sweden and is eighth in
the world championship standings. Hamill is ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Round 3 of the National Championship Series is set for Sept. 20 in
Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Amick, the AMA's vice president of events and entertainment,
told riders that the series probably would expand in the future. This
is the first season the national championship is being determined in
a series format.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in controlled growth," he said. "It's such a
break from tradition. It's been well received by the riders, and we'd
like to see five races next year, and eventually, maybe 10 races.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to go east a little bit, but most of the talent is in
the West."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League</TE>
<TE>   Actor Jason Priestley continues to recover after surgery in
Indianapolis on Wednesday for his broken back and feet.</TE>
<TE>   Priestley, injured Sunday in practice for the Kentucky 100
Infiniti Pro Series race, is expected to make a full recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect him to be walking from the wheelchair to his car when
he's ready to be out of here," said Dr. Scott Bjerke, medical
director of trauma services at Methodist Hospital. "I see no reason
why he can't get back to racing and driving on city streets in the
near future."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley probably will remain in the hospital for at least
another week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toyota's new V-8 engine being developed in Costa Mesa for the IRL
next season got its first official test Monday at Kentucky Speedway.
Helio Castroneves drove it nearly 200 miles the day after the
Belterra Indy 300.</TE>
<TE>   "We're pleased with how far along the Toyota Indy V-8 is so early
in its development," said Lee White, Toyota Racing Development group
vice president and general manager. "While not getting too specific,
our times today would have qualified us comfortably into Sunday's IRL
race here at Kentucky and the car appeared to perform even better on
longer runs."</TE>
<TE>   MK Racing, one of three chassis manufacturers for the IRL, will
call its 2003-05 generation Falcon Cars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CART</TE>
<TE>   Championship Auto Racing Teams announced its tentative schedule
for 2003. The Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach will be run April 13,
and the season-ending 500-mile race at California Speedway is set for
Nov. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The series will open at a new venue, St. Petersburg, Fla., on
March 23.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more interesting facets are a European date on April 27
at a site to be determined, and a May 18 date in Chicago. FIA rules
that prohibited CART from running on European road courses are no
longer in effect, so CART is not limited to running on an oval, as it
did last year in Germany. A city street race in Chicago is also on
CART's agenda, and is tentatively scheduled for a week before the
Indianapolis 500.</TE>
<TE>   As CART continues to restructure its series, the airport race at
Cleveland probably will be a night race. Also, expect CART's board of
directors to approve another set of financial incentives within the
next week to further reduce operating costs for 2003. Coupled with
previously announced incentives in the Cosworth engine program, the
cost of competing next year could potentially be cut in half.</TE>
<TE>   PWR Championship Racing and Sigma Autosport folded their
operations at midseason, leaving only 18 cars, but 25 teams have
submitted letters of intent to compete in 2003, three that are
currently in the IRL.</TE>

<LD>Deuce McAllister had 70 total yards as the New Orleans Saints beat
the Dolphins, 24-7, Thursday night in an exhibition game at Miami.
The Saints held Ricky Williams to 17 yards rushing in eight carries
in his first game against his former team.</LD>
<LD>   McAllister ran 11 times for 42 yards and caught three passes for
28 yards--all in the first half--and helped New Orleans build a 17-0
lead midway through the second quarter. The Saints also got plenty of
assistance from the mistake-prone Dolphins.</LD>
<LD>   Jay Fiedler had three passes intercepted in the first half, and
Miami had a special-teams breakdown for the second time in as many
games. The Dolphins also were penalized eight times for 54 yards in
the first half.</LD>
<TE>   Fiedler, who missed much of training camp following hip surgery,
regressed in his second start in a four-day span.</TE>
<TE>   He completed eight of 19 passes for 83 yards. Although he was
under heavy pressure for much of the half, Fiedler was off target on
many passes. He played six series on a night when he was supposed to
go 20 plays, staying in the game to try to work through his mistakes.</TE>

<TE>   Tennessee 24, Oakland 14--Steve McNair threw a 34-yard touchdown
pass to Derrick Mason and the Titans added two more touchdowns in the
first quarter after Raider turnovers at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans scored within the span of 12 seconds and added a third
less than nine minutes into the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their second road exhibition in six days, the Raiders lost
four turnovers, allowed three sacks and were penalized nine times.</TE>
<TE>   The Titans announced that defensive end Jevon Kearse will sit out
the final two exhibition games and possibly the season opener because
of a strained triceps muscle in his left arm. He injured the arm
Tuesday during practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Jets 34, Baltimore 16--Vinny Testaverde threw for 129
yards and a touchdown in only three series, and LaMont Jordan ran for
two third-quarter scores for the Jets at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Javin Hunter returned a kickoff 99 yards for the Ravens, who
managed only three points against the Jets' first-team defense. Jamal
Lewis ran for 24 yards in four carries in his first game since the
2001 Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   New York turned three Baltimore turnovers into 17 points,
including a 40-yard interception return for a touchdown by Andrew
Davison.</TE>
<TE>   Testaverde completed nine for 12 passes, leading the Jets to a
touchdown and a field goal in his first two series and moving them
into field-goal range in his final drive. In two exhibition games, he
is 15 for 20 for 190 yards with no interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Testaverde threw a 31-yard touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles and
completed four passes to Wayne Chrebet for 87 yards before leaving
late in the first half with the Jets ahead, 10-3.</TE>

<TE>   Randall Cunningham will officially retire from the NFL as a member
of the Eagles before an exhibition game against the Baltimore Ravens
next Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham, who spent last season with the Ravens, played with the
Eagles from 1985-95. He holds four team records, including 300-yard
passing games (13), yards passing in a game (447 yards) and longest
punt (91 yards).</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham is the NFL's all-time leader in yards rushing among
quarterbacks with 4,928.</TE>
<TE>   "Randall brought so much excitement to the city of Philadelphia,
the Eagles and to the NFL," Eagles' owner Jeffrey Lurie. "I'm very
proud and excited that he wanted to retire as an Eagle."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham finished with 29,979 yards passing, 207 touchdowns and
134 interceptions.</TE>

<HD>Astros Are Struck Down by Prior</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Prior mowed down the Houston Astros and showed that the best way
to pitch with the wind blowing out at Wrigley Field was to keep them
from putting the ball in play.</LD>
<LD>   The Cub rookie struck out 12 in only six innings Thursday at
Chicago, including seven in a row to tie a club record, as Chicago
beat the Astros, 6-4.</LD>
<LD>   "I was aware of it, it felt good," Prior said. "I've always been a
strikeout pitcher. I think everybody considers me one. But it's not
my goal to strike out guys."</LD>
<TE>   Prior, whose season high of 13 strikeouts was set Aug. 4 against
Colorado, got his first six strikeouts during the streak on missed
swings. The seven in a row tied the Cub record shared by Jamie Moyer
and Kerry Wood, and it was three short of Tom Seaver's major league
record.</TE>
<TE>   Prior gave up three runs--one earned--five hits and one walk. He
has 129 strikeouts in 100 innings since joining the Cubs earlier this
season, including 43 in his last 27 innings--a span in which he has
walked only three.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs hit five homers with Sammy Sosa lifting his major
league-leading 41st in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Holding a 1-0 lead in the second, Prior gave up a leadoff triple
to Richard Hidalgo, an RBI single to Brad Ausmus and a double to Adam
Everett.</TE>
<TE>   Then he got on his strikeout roll.</TE>
<TE>   "When Hidalgo got on base in the second inning, I just wanted to
minimize the damage. Unfortunately, I gave up two more hits and I had
second and third with no outs and so I went right after those guys
and wanted to strike out the side and that's what I did," Prior said.</TE>
<TE>   Prior then struck out pitcher Kirk Saarloos, Orlando Merced and
Craig Biggio, and he fanned Lance Berkman, Bagwell and Geoff Blum in
the third.</TE>
<TE>   He threw a called third strike past Hidalgo to open the fourth for
his seventh in a row before Ausmus walked to end the streak.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm throwing well, making quality pitches whether
it's a strike or a ball," Prior said. "I'm putting it in the spots
where I want it to be."</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos, a former Cal State Fullerton standout who had won five
consecutive decisions, gave up five runs and seven hits in seven
innings, giving up four solo home runs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 7, Cincinnati 2--Randy Johnson recovered from a one-day
illness and gave up only two hits in eight innings, striking out 11
at Cincinnati as the Diamondbacks swept the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (18-4) gave up Brandon Larson's solo homer in the second
and Sean Casey's infield single as he extended his winning streak to
five games. The left-hander has been dominant during that stretch--41
innings, five runs, 59 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson has struck out at least 10 batters 12 times this season,
and 183 times in his career.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 11, Pittsburgh 5--Pinch-hitter Eli Marrero hit a
tiebreaking single and Tino Martinez had a three-run double in the
Cardinals' six-run ninth inning at Pittsburgh as St. Louis won its
season-high sixth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals extended their lead in the NL Central to four games
over Houston by sweeping a four-game series in Pittsburgh for the
first time since Aug. 12-15, 1971.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, Milwaukee 0--Joe Roa scattered four singles over a
career-high seven innings for his first victory in more than five
years as the Phillies completed a three-game sweep of the Brewers at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Roa (1-1) struck out two and hasn't walked a batter in any of his
four starts (22 innings) this season. His last victory came while
pitching for the San Francisco Giants on June 14, 1997, at Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 5, New York 3--Tom Lampkin had three hits and two RBIs
as the Padres capitalized on three Met errors to extend New York's
longest home losing streak in 22 years.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets have lost five in a row overall and eight consecutive at
Shea Stadium, falling a season-high four games below .500. It's New
York's longest losing streak at home since the Mets dropped eight in
a row in August 1980 on the way to a 67-95 season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco at Atlanta--Chipper Jones hit a two-out, two-run
single in the ninth inning, then rain halted the game in the top of
the 10th with the teams tied, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   The tie left the Giants one game behind Dodgers in the NL
wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   The game will be replayed only if it has a bearing on the
postseason race, possibly on Sept. 23--when both teams have a
scheduled day off--or the day after the regular season ends.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, Thursday's game gets recorded officially as a tie, and
all the stats count.</TE>

<HD>High School Football Player Collapses, Dies in Florida</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A high school football player died after collapsing during practice.</LD>
<LD>   Anthony Hilton, 16, a junior at Robert E. Lee High, collapsed
about 4 p.m. Wednesday. He was rushed to St. Vincent's hospital but
was pronounced dead at 4:50 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman Candy
Bowen.</LD>
<LD>   The Duval County Medical Examiner's Office said Thursday that a
cause of death hadn't been determined.</LD>
<TE>   Hilton, a running back, and his teammates were in their third day
of practice when he collapsed. He was not wearing full pads because
Florida High School Activities Association rules restrict teams to
helmets and shorts for the first three practice days of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton was in a conditioning or agility drill when he collapsed,
said Lt. Rick Graham of the Duval County Sheriff's Office.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said Athletic Director Gary Warner told him the player had
passed the physical examination all players must undergo before
participating in practice.</TE>
<TE>   Hilton also participated in track and wrestling.</TE>
<TE>   According to the latest report issued by the National Center for
Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, 17 deaths of high school and
junior high students last year were directly or indirectly related to
football.</TE>

<HD>Finally, a Good Break for Yim</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would have taken a lot more than a broken toe to keep Tabitha Yim
out of the U.S. gymnastics championships.</LD>
<LD>   Or a broken toe and an injured hip.</LD>
<LD>   Or the broken toe, injured hip and fractured ankle the Irvine
teenager suffered in miserable succession over six months within the
last year.</LD>
<TE>   "It was pretty tough," she said of her enforced training break. "I
did a lot of conditioning and strength exercises."</TE>
<TE>   That work served her well at last week's U.S. competition in
Cleveland, where she finished second in the all-around, first on the
balance beam and second in floor exercise. Her performance earned her
an invitation to a selection camp next month at Bela Karolyi's Texas
ranch, where the U.S. team will be chosen for the World Championships
at Debrecen, Hungary, in November.</TE>
<TE>   "My leg was all the way better, but I wasn't completely prepared
going into the competition," she said. "I had to rely on my
instincts."</TE>
<TE>   Her instincts were sound. Although she didn't have time to add new
elements to her routines, she finished behind only defending national
champion Tasha Schwikert, who had 75.550 points to 74.625 for Yim.</TE>
<TE>   "Tabitha's a very hard worker," said Beth Rybacki, who with her
husband, Steve, coaches Yim at Charter Oaks Gym in Covina. "She comes
in the gym every day and listens to what you tell her. Despite the
injury, she kept pushing herself. We were hoping she'd rely on her
experience and that everything would come out the way it did."</TE>
<TE>   Yim, who also competes at the novice level in figure skating, is
used to overcoming obstacles. Her father, Howard, died three years
ago of a heart defect, leaving her mother to support her and an older
brother. Less than a year later, Yim's figure skating coach, Ronnie
Robertson, also died.</TE>
<TE>   The 16-year-old's strong will and discipline carried her through
the worst times, and she hopes better things are in store. While she
prepares for the selection camp, she's eagerly anticipating
Thursday's T.J. Maxx International Gymnastics Challenge at the
Arrowhead Pond, an event that matches U.S. stars against
international rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Yim, Schwikert, U.S. junior champion Hollie Vise and U.S. junior
runner-up Carly Patterson are expected to compete for the U.S.
against a squad scheduled to include two-time world all-around
champion Svetlana Khorkina of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The event will kick off a buildup to the 2003 World Championships,
to be held at the Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait for my family to come and watch me," Yim said. "It's
15 minutes from my house. I think it should be fun. And I get to see
what it's like in the arena and just how it's going to be for worlds.
It's going to be great."</TE>

<TE>   As the Golden League track circuit resumes today with the
Weltklasse meet in Zurich, Switzerland, five athletes remain eligible
for prizes of gold ingots for winning their disciplines in all seven

Gail Devers (100 hurdles) and Marion Jones (100) must win tonight, at
Brussels Aug. 30 and at Berlin Sept. 6 to claim shares of the
jackpot.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, twice the world champion in the 100, and Zhanna
Pintusevich-Block of Ukraine, the woman who defeated Jones for the
title last year, are scheduled for their first head-to-head
competition next Friday at London's Crystal Palace. Pintusevich-Block
has the world's top time this season, 10.83 seconds, .01 faster than
Jones.</TE>

<TE>   Born to Luge?</TE>
<TE>   Wannabe luge riders can learn from U.S. Olympic and national team
coaches Aug. 24-25 when the USA Luge Slider Search comes to Long
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   For a $15 fee, boys and girls from 10 to 14 can try navigating a
sled on wheels and learn the basics of steering, positioning and
stopping. They'll also get to make runs down a paved course near the
Queen Mary.</TE>
<TE>   The most promising sliders will be invited to train next winter at
camps in Lake Placid, N.Y.; Marquette, Mich., and Park City, Utah.
The top prospects from clinics conducted around the country will be
considered for the 2003-04 USA Luge development team.</TE>
<TE>   Six members of the Salt Lake City Olympic luge team were

<TE>   Britain's Paula Radcliffe,</TE>
<TE>   who has won the London Marathon, the 5,000 meters at the
Commonwealth Games and the 10,000 at the European Championships in
the last year, told British reporters she's not sure what distance
she will run at the Athens Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "When you think that it's the marathon in Athens, which is the
home of the marathon, then maybe things change a little bit," said
Radcliffe, who will run the Chicago Marathon in October.</TE>
<TE>   A crusader against doping in sports, she recently asked British
sports authorities to release the results of her last five drug
tests--all negative--to make the point that success can be achieved
without drugs.... Boris Alexandrov, who won a gold medal with the
1976 Soviet Olympic hockey team and later coached a club and the
Kazakhstan national team, died in a car crash recently.... The 2005
figure skating World Championships were awarded to Moscow and the

<LD>Bill and Jim Kingsmill, father and son, consider themselves "just a
couple of weekend warriors."</LD>
<LD>   During the week they're hard at work, as an electrical contractor
and a policeman, but by dawn just about every Saturday, they're on
the water, miles from the mainland, scouring the horizon for diving
birds, jumping tuna, breezing marlin and floating kelp paddies.</LD>
<LD>   Weekend warriors?</LD>
<TE>   That may be the elder Kingsmill's assessment. But there are few
who take the sport as seriously as the San Clemente fishermen,
dedicated members of the Dana Angling Club. And there are even fewer
with the means and determination to spend their weekends hunting one
of Southern California's most powerful and elusive game fish, the
striped marlin.</TE>
<TE>   The local marlin season is getting underway--during the last week
a few have been caught and dozens have been seen--and the Kingsmills
are wasting no time shifting their attention from tuna and yellowtail
to the much more finicky billfish.</TE>
<TE>   Fishing Saturday near San Clemente Island, aboard the Wild Bill,
Jim Kingsmill baited and brought to leader, after a 30-minute fight,
a striped marlin estimated at 140 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The catch earned Kingsmill--who was also fishing with Dave Herrera
and Brian Schultz--the cherished first-marlin flag from his club. But
it also helped signal the start of a season that many predict will be
one of the most productive in years, based on developing favorable
conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be a very good marlin year," Bill Kingsmill
said. "Why? Because I'm already hearing of fish clear up to and above
Santa Barbara Island, at Catalina, at San Clemente Island, off
Mission Bay and farther south off Ensenada. The water is doing a lot
of funny things, but things like years ago, which is good."</TE>
<TE>   Basically, the water is warming up and teeming with bait fish and
large predators.</TE>
<TE>   Team Kingsmill, as the foursome refers to itself, began its
morning last week with a steady stream of blind albacore strikes as
it plied the offshore banks in a 40-foot boat named after its owner.
Beneath patches of floating kelp, they found more albacore and huge
schools of large and hungry yellowtail, with some coming over the
rail at 25 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We even caught a bluefin weighing about 18 pounds," Bill
Kingsmill, 58, said.</TE>
<TE>   Having had their fill of smaller game, they acted on a tip and
motored closer to San Clemente Island. The move paid off. Jim
Kingsmill, 36, spotted four or five marlin from a quarter-mile away
through his binoculars, and the fishermen spent the next 30 minutes
casting mackerel, trying to get a taker. Only Kingsmill succeeded,
though, and the fight, for him, was fairly uneventful, featuring only
a couple of jumps.</TE>
<TE>   The Kingsmills considered gaffing the fish and hauling it to
Avalon to be weighed as Santa Catalina Island's first marlin of the
season. But tourists on the pier in recent years have jeered anglers
for killing marlin and Team Kingsmill decided it did not need the
recognition, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, 'Why subject ourselves to that?' " Bill Kingsmill
said. "I have nothing against killing a fish if there's a reason to
do it, and if this would have been the first one caught on the coast
we probably would have brought it in. But we saw no reason to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Team Kingsmill has plenty of reason to return to the fishing
grounds Saturday: It's the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kona Blues</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend's 43rd Hawaiian International Billfish Tournament,
which featured four teams from Southern California, was one of the
least productive in recent history because of unusually slack
currents all but devoid of bait fish and, thus, the larger predators.</TE>
<TE>   In all, only 16 blue marlin were caught and only one of those, a
482.5-pounder that propelled the Malindi Sea Fishing Club of Kenya to
victory, met the 300-pound minimum weight required to be gaffed and
brought in to be weighed on a points-per-pound basis. By comparison,
a year earlier 56 blue marlin were caught, the largest a 617-pounder.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not to say this year's tournament was not without its
exciting moments.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day, for instance, a Hilo Yacht Club member's straw
hat blew off in the wind and, as one of the crew reached over to
retrieve it, a "rather large brown shark, perhaps a tiger, came up,
opened its mouth and just swallowed it," the team's Jim Patterson
said. "We were fortunate, though, because the crewman had been
thinking about jumping in moments earlier to cool off."</TE>
<TE>   The most drama, however, was provided on the fourth and final day
last Friday, when Sam Spinello, 67, of the Malibu Marlin Club battled
a blue marlin for 4 1/2 hours before bringing it to leader, whereupon
it was gaffed and hauled aboard. The length of the fight alone led
both Spinello and those waiting on Kailua Pier to believe that the
Southern California team might at least give the Kenya team's fish a
run for its money.</TE>
<TE>   When the Ho'okele pulled in, Spinello was greeted with hearty
applause, but when the marlin was lassoed by the tail and hoisted
onto the scale even the angler knew it didn't have a chance. In fact,
it weighed only 269 pounds and thus was disqualified. Like the marlin
he posed next to, a sheepish Spinello seemed to be shrinking by the
minute.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California wasn't entirely blanked, however. Marylin
Stephens of the King Harbor Marlin Club was named the top Wahine
Angler for tagging and releasing two blue marlin, which earned her
team 300 "release points" apiece and an overall fifth-place finish
among 22 teams.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show that you should never give up hope," she
said, referring to her second marlin, which struck her lure five
minutes before the lines-out call on the final day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Biting in Baja</TE>
<TE>   The third annual Bisbee's East Cape Offshore Tournament, held last
week at Palmas de Cortez Resort in Los Barriles, was deemed a huge
success by director Wayne Bisbee.</TE>
<TE>   On the winning team, Sonrisas, were locals Cooke Bausman, Mike
O'Dell and Fred Green. They earned $60,394, thanks largely to a
425-pound blue marlin caught on the first of three days of fishing.</TE>
<TE>   It was the largest of only two billfish meeting the 300-pound
minimum weight required to be killed and weighed. In all, 68 billfish
were released. The next Bisbee's Offshore Circuit Tournament will be
held in La Paz Sept. 11-14. The world famous Bisbee's Black and Blue
Marlin Jackpot Tournament is scheduled Oct. 15-19 in Cabo San Lucas.

<TE>   Bluefin Bonanza</TE>
<TE>   Highly prized bluefin tuna have stolen the spotlight from albacore
this week, providing tackle-busting thrills for anglers fishing in
Mexico aboard San Diego overnight boats. The Gallilean, for example,
on Wednesday encountered a school that bit for eight hours about 75
miles south of Fisherman's Landing. The boat returned with 110
bluefin averaging 20-30 pounds, with some much bigger.</TE>
<TE>   Farther south, the bluefin are making an even bigger splash for
those aboard the multiday boats.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview this week with www.976tuna.com, Polaris Supreme
skipper Tommy Rothery reported sporadic encounters with schools of
fish averaging 90 pounds and weighing up to 140.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pulling the Plants</TE>
<TE>   Citing a shortage in manpower caused by the same budget
constraints many state agencies are experiencing, the Department of
Fish and Game has curtailed its trout-planting operations throughout
much of the Eastern Sierra's Mono County.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically affected are Bridgeport-area waters planted by Hot
Creek Hatchery, a facility that annually raises more than 800,000
trout and spawns more than eight million eggs for use in other
hatcheries in California and Nevada. The hatchery has three vacant
positions and a state-mandated hiring freeze, during the summer spawn
when the fish and their ponds require constant attention, has limited
the staff's ability to meet its delivery schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, people are concerned and understandably so," says Mike
Haynie, hatchery supervisor for the region. "But the fact is, we're
just running out of people."</TE>
<TE>   Haynie added that volunteers are being sought to help with
deliveries and that the DFG is scrambling to fill the vacant
positions, at least temporarily, with employees from other regions.
He also stressed that his staff will do everything it can to ensure
the usual heavy plants, in all of the waters it stocks, in advance of
the busy Labor Day holiday weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   September Madness</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Martens of Castaic, fresh off a second-place finish in the
Bassmasters Classic at Montgomery, Ala., is among 48 pro bass
fishermen who will compete for a share of $800,000 being offered as
part of the Wal-Mart FLW Tour Championship Sept. 11-14 at Cross Lake
near Shreveport, La.</TE>
<TE>   Martens is seeded 16th and will fish against No. 33 Rob Kilby of
Hot Springs, Ark., in a tournament with a bracket-style format
similar to that used in the NCAA basketball tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Yelas of Tyler, Texas, is top-seeded. The winner will pocket
$260,000.</TE>

<DH>Golf: Furyk and Funk share lead at 68, but first round
isn't completed after electrical storm forces a three-hour delay.
Woods struggles to a 71.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>If you took away the television towers, media tents, extra security,
big-tournament hype and the entry form of Tiger Woods, Thursday's
first round of the 84th PGA Championship could have passed for the
first round of the Greater Milwaukee Open.</LD>
<LD>   A lot of under-the-radar golfers say they enjoy the PGA
Championship because, of the four majors, the course setup reminds
them most of life on the regular tour.</LD>
<LD>   So, what better way to celebrate Day 1 at Hazeltine National Golf
Club than to offer a leaderboard led by Jim Furyk and Fred Funk, each
of whom finished a weather-delayed day at four-under 68.</LD>
<TE>   Thursday's first round could not be completed because of an
early-morning electrical storm that held up play for almost three
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Play was suspended at 8:19 p.m. local time, with 39 players still
on course. Those players will complete their round this morning.</TE>
<TE>   When the horn sounded, Furyk and Funk held a one-shot lead over
Peter Lonard of Australia and Justin Rose of England, who shot
three-under 69s. Lee Janzen, Davis Love III, Jeff Sluman and Mark
Calcavecchia were two shots behind at 70.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, despite an ongoing struggle with his driver, shot 71,
three shots behind the leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Among other notables on the course when play was halted were Phil
Mickelson, who was three over with three holes to play, and David
Duval, who was even par with four holes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, though, you could not have had a more Average Joe
Invitational. Furyk and Funk represent an artist's rendering
composite of what the PGA Championship has strangely become.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve of the tournament's last 16 champions have called the PGA
their first and/or only major title.</TE>
<TE>   At day's end, of course, you knew this was not an ordinary
tournament because Woods was here, grinding out pars, telling himself
over and over this really is a major tournament, one that counts just
as much as the Masters in his pursuit of Jack Nicklaus' record of 18
professional major titles.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had taken only one swing, his opening drive on the 10th tee,
when the weather horn sounded in the morning and players scurried off
the course.</TE>
<TE>   They don't take chances with lightning in golf, particularly at
Hazeltine National. In the first round of the 1991 U.S. Open,
spectator Billy Fadell was killed and five others were injured when
lightning struck on the 16th fairway.</TE>
<TE>   Woods never regained his rhythm after play resumed, struggling
with his driver, but he survived consecutive bogeys on No. 18 and No.
1 to stay within striking distance of the leaders. Woods had 13 pars,
three birdies and two bogeys, then headed to the practice range to
correct a hitch in his swing.</TE>
<TE>   "My backswing was off," Woods said. "When that gets off, either I
get defensive and hit it left or I get defensive and hit it right."</TE>
<TE>   At the par-four fourth hole, Woods' wayward tee shot struck a
course marshal.</TE>
<TE>   "At least he could have kicked it out a little further than that,"
Woods joked.</TE>
<TE>   With Woods seemingly pacing himself for a weekend charge, the
first-day leaderboard had a very ordinary look.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Furyk, Funk, Lonard and Rose aren't worthy players.</TE>
<TE>   Each has amassed more than $1 million in earnings this year, yet
none has distinguished himself in majors, although Rose did score a
stunning fourth-place finish as a 17-year-old amateur at the 1998
British Open.</TE>
<TE>   Furyk has had the ultimate yo-yo year, somehow combining six
top-10 finishes, including a win at the Memorial, with missing the
cut six times, including at all three previous majors: the Masters,
U.S. Open and British Open.</TE>
<TE>   He has suffered through an inner ear problem and basked in the joy
of the birth of his first child.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a good year and a frustrating year all in one," Furyk
said.</TE>
<TE>   Furyk, 32, perfectly fits the composite of someone who might make
news here this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Reminded that a lot of first-time major winners have been crowned
at the PGA Championship, he said, "That history probably isn't going
to help me too much."</TE>
<TE>   Furyk, whose swing was once described as looking like "an octopus
falling out of a tree," has five top-25 finishes in seven previous
PGA appearances and is a seven-time winner on the PGA Tour. He posted
his best PGA finish in 1997, tying for sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Funk, 46, might best be described as a consummate touring pro. He
has won five times on the PGA Tour, although not since 1998 at the
Deposit Guaranty Classic.</TE>
<TE>   His best PGA Championship finish was ninth in 2000, and he was
steady as they come Thursday, his only bobble a bogey on No. 13, a
par three. He needed only 24 putts.</TE>
<TE>   Funk did not qualify for any of this year's three previous majors,
and made it into the PGA only because he ranks among the top 70 in
the official money standings.</TE>
<TE>   He knows that winning a major at his age is a major longshot, yet
that didn't stop him from enjoying the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to be up top for a while," he said, knowing Woods may
be ready to pounce. "He's still one under, so the cream will rise to
the top. That's why they play four rounds."</TE>
<TE>   Lonard, a 35-year-old PGA Tour rookie, might have a little more
staying power.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 11th at this year's U.S. Open at Bethpage and tied for
14th at the British Open and has shown he can handle whatever life
hands him.</TE>
<TE>   He was stricken in 1992 with Ross River Fever, a
mosquito-transmitted virus that left him severely fatigued and with
arthritis symptoms in his joints. The virus knocked Lonard out of
golf for more than a year, he said, and he eventually worked his way
back by taking a job as a club pro.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't worry much anymore about getting stricken again,
even in a mosquito-infested place like Minnesota, because "every sort
of place has some mosquito virus that scares the hell out of you."</TE>
<TE>   Lonard, who won twice on the Australian Tour, wouldn't be in
America if not for the friends who goaded him into entering
qualifying school.</TE>
<TE>   "They just started ribbing me, thinking I wasn't good enough or
something," Lonard said. "So, I thought, 'Right, well, I'll come over
and give it a go,' and it all went all right so far."</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH HAROLD REYNOLDS</KH>
<HD>Analyst Doesn't Labor to Remain Optimistic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WHARTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The turmoil surrounding baseball's labor talks is nothing new to
Harold Reynolds, who experienced the process as an All-Star second
baseman for the Seattle Mariners during the 1980s and early '90s. Now
Reynolds is seeing the negotiations from another perspective,
chronicling them as an analyst for ESPN's "Baseball Tonight."</LD>
<LD>   The sides appear to have hit a stumbling block on the issue of a
payroll tax and the players' union has scheduled a conference call
today that could result in the announcement of a strike date.</LD>
<LD>   Reynolds, who ended his career with the Angels in 1994, remains
guardedly optimistic, if only because he believes owners and players
realize the alternative to a resolution--another work stoppage--could
be disastrous for the game.</LD>
<TE>   "They've got to be successful or it's going to get ugly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Question: What is it like to go through labor negotiations as a
player?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The biggest frustration for a ballplayer is, everybody
thinks you are greedy. It's not all about money. That is a big part
of it, but you're also fighting for those players coming up behind
you, pension plans and all that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Many fans belong to labor unions and have gone on strike to
fight for relatively small wage increases. Shouldn't they be
skeptical about a high-paid player wanting even more?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: My mother will never understand why a ballplayer making a
million dollars would walk out on his job. It's hard to explain, but
the principles of the union have not changed. You are fighting for
free agency, you're fighting against being a pawn. You want to have a
say and be part of the industry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Has your view of baseball's recurring labor problems changed,
now that you are looking in from the outside?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: If you're a player, you're only going to hear your side. Now I
have a better perspective on both sides. I think a lot of player
salaries are not justified by the performances and that's a big
problem. But the biggest issue I have with the whole thing is that
the commissioner's position is not a neutral position. [Commissioner
Bud Selig] is an owner who is trying to make this thing work.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where do fans figure into the equation?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: You hear fans yelling "We pay your salary, go out and hit the
ball." Now, the reality is, the fans don't have a lot of say. It's
not like when they came through the turnstiles in the 1950s. It's
sorry to say, but even if they didn't go to games, baseball would
still sell its TV package and that's a lot of revenue. At the same
time, it's a catch-22 situation. The game doesn't work without the
fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What happens to the relationship between baseball and its fans
if the players go on strike?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: We're in an era of so much entertainment. The fans have got
video games. There's the X Games. There are so many other things that
can grab their attention. America's pastime is having trouble keeping
its grip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are these negotiations different from those in the past or are
owners and players doing the same old dance?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: Totally different. I don't think it's blood and guts this time.
They are sitting down, understanding they can't have a work stoppage.
I'm actually very optimistic. If you asked me a year ago, I'd have
said no way. But both sides are really communicating. Will they set a
strike date? They probably will, but they are communicating.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Each time a baseball strike is threatened, some people call for
government intervention. Should President Bush, who once owned the
Texas Rangers, get involved?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: It's a no-win situation for him and I would not want to see him
put in that position. He'd end up being thought of as the president
who was an owner. We need someone who doesn't have anything to gain
from either side.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Can you imagine a resolution that could break the cycle of
discord or is it the nature of baseball as big business to repeat
this process every few years?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A: The problem is, we wait until the last minute to deal with
things. The deadline may be five years away but we need to make
adjustments as we go along. We need a person in the commissioner's
seat who is like a CEO operating a business, taking inventory of how
we're doing, critiquing things and adjusting to make the game work
for fans, players and owners.</TE>

<LD>British police are investigating a claim made by Crystal Palace
reserve goalkeeper Alex Kolinko of Latvia, who has filed a complaint
alleging that the team's coach, former England international Trevor
Francis, assaulted him during a first division match against Bradford
on Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Francis has admitted to hitting Kolinko, but said no harm was
intended.</LD>
<LD>   "I was very disappointed by [Bradford's] goal, and when I turned
round I saw Kolinko laughing, so I cuffed him around the ear,"
Francis said. "It was only a bit of fun."</LD>
<TE>   The referee banished Francis from the dugout after being told of
the incident by the fourth official and the English Football Assn. is
investigating the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The game ended in a 1-1 tie.</TE>

<TE>   USA Roster Set</TE>
<TE>   Coach Thomas Rongen on Thursday selected 20 players, four from
Southern California, to the United States under-20 national team that
will play Brazil, Italy and Ukraine in an eight-nation tournament in
Spain, starting next week.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team will leave Monday to play in the XIX Torneo
Internacional de Futbol de l'Alcudia Aug. 24-29 in Valencia, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Rongen's squad includes UCLA defender Jordan Harvey of Mission
Viejo, Stanford defender Chad Marshall of Riverside, midfielder David
Johnson of Venice, who plays for Willem II in the Netherlands, and
midfielder Raul Palomares of Inglewood, who plays for Osijek in
Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   The squad, which in November will try to qualify for the FIFA
World Youth Championship, also features five Major League Soccer
players: midfielders Craig Capano (Chicago Fire), Justin Mapp (D.C.
United) and Jordan Stone (Dallas Burn) and forwards Devin Barclay
(San Jose Earthquakes) and Ed Johnson (Dallas Burn).</TE>
<TE>   The D.C. United duo of Bobby Convey and Santino Quaranta is part
of the U.S. team but will not make the trip to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Convey was not released by the MLS team and Quaranta is recovering
from abdominal hernia surgery.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. is in Group A and plays Brazil on Aug. 24, Italy on Aug.
26 and Ukraine on Aug. 27. Group B consists of Costa Rica, Gabon,
Spain and Uruguay.</TE>

<TE>   Only One Award Now</TE>
<TE>   For years, the nation's outstanding male and female college
players have been honored annually by winning either the Hermann
Trophy, started in 1967, or the Missouri Athletic Club award, started
in 1986, or both.</TE>
<TE>   That confusing situation was remedied Thursday when the two awards
were merged into one, to be known as the Missouri Athletic Club's
Hermann Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kirovski Gets Permit</TE>
<TE>   Jovan Kirovski, the forward from Escondido who was an alternate on
the 2002 U.S. World Cup team, Thursday was granted a work permit to
play for Birmingham City in the English Premier League.</TE>
<TE>   Kirovski's permit request was denied last week by the British
government, but the club successfully appealed, and if the paperwork
can be completed in time, he will be eligible to play against
defending champion Arsenal when the English season begins Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bolivians Strike</TE>
<TE>   The players from Bolivian champion Oriente Petrolero refused to
travel to a road game against Real Potosi on Wednesday night,
claiming they had not been paid in two months. The game had to be
postponed.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Chavez, the club's president, said the players would be
paid in full by next week, but also threatened disciplinary action
against them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ballack Honor</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ballack, the midfielder whose headed goal knocked the U.S.
out of the World Cup in the quarterfinals, has been named Germany's
player of the year.</TE>
<TE>   He beat out goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, who had won the award the
previous two years, 433-345 in voting by the nation's sportswriters.</TE>

<HD>Mabika, Leslie in Control</HD>
<DH>Sparks: They combine for 47 points in 78-61 victory over
Seattle in first game of Western Conference playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The opening salvo in what figures to be an intense first-round
playoff series came at 18:25 of the first half, when Spark guard
Mwadi Mabika drove through the middle of the Seattle Storm defense
and softly banked in a layup.</LD>
<LD>   That was the first statement to the Storm that this wasn't the
same Sparks' team it beat twice during the regular season.</LD>
<LD>   The more declarative statement made was a 78-61 victory by the
Sparks Thursday night before 9,686 at KeyArena, giving them a 1-0
lead in their Western Conference playoff series.</LD>
<TE>   Mabika and Lisa Leslie combined for 47 points. Each dominated a
half. Mabika had 14 of her 23 points in the first half, and Leslie
scored 15 of her 24 points in the second half. In fact, Leslie scored
the Sparks' first 13 points of the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a heck of a game, and it was probably the most complete
game we've played since beating Utah [102-75 on July 7]," Spark Coach
Michael Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   Added Leslie, who also had nine rebounds: "I thought we had a lot
of poise and composure on both ends of the floor. We really executed
well offensively, and defensively we did a really good job of helping
where we needed to."</TE>
<TE>   Lauren Jackson led Seattle with 19 points. Sue Bird had 11, but
only two in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle shot erratically in the second half against an aggressive
defense. The Storm made only eight of 27 shots in the second half and
missed eight shots between Simone Edwards' three-footer at 10:19 and
Adia Barnes' three-pointer at 2:52.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks led by as many as 19 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We stuck to our defensive plans," Cooper said. "We wanted to
limit the number of touches Lauren Jackson got. We wanted to keep
Bird from penetrating the middle. And we had to concentrate on
rebounding. They are the No. 1 offensive rebounding team, and we're
the No. 1 defensive rebounding team. Whoever imposed their authority
in that area had a good chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Bird, who played on two NCAA championship teams at Connecticut,
saw the Sparks do the kind of things her Huskies' team did last year
in going 39-0.</TE>
<TE>   "I think L.A. showed how they are an experienced team and that
they have been here before," Bird said. "I do not think that we
really played our game."</TE>
<TE>   The next game is Saturday at Staples Center. A third game, if
needed, will be Monday in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper did not declare the series over--"The playoffs really start
when one team wins the first game, and we haven't been that
comfortable at home this year"--but the other Sparks do not think the
Storm will beat them twice in Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "Championships are won on the road, which is why that first game
is so key," said Tamecka Dixon, who had 12 points. "I believe with a
short playoff series, the first game on the road is very important
because you have two at home. If you go home down, your back's
against a wall. And anything can happen in one game."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks made 10 of their first 12 shots to take a 23-11 lead in
the first nine minutes. Mabika was hurting Seattle with drives
through the lane and with her outside shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle looked tentative against the Sparks, making only four of
its first 13 shots.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson and Bird led a 13-4 run that pulled the Storm within
two points with four minutes to play before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks spurted again, and led, 37-30, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't making my jump shot this morning during the shootaround,
so I told myself to go to the basket tonight," Mabika said.</TE>

<HD>Toms Down on His Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK and CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>David Toms is not only defending his title in the PGA Championship,
he is also the No. 6-ranked golfer in the world. That's why what Toms
said Thursday after his five-over-par 77 sounded so unusual.</LD>
<LD>   Toms played in a group with Tiger Woods and Ernie Els and said,
basically, that he didn't belong there.</LD>
<LD>   "To be honest with you, the two guys I played with today, I'm just
not in their league," he said. "These guys are hitting six-irons and
seven-irons [into a par three] and I'm trying to finagle a four-iron
in there somehow. You just can't compete with that, week in and week
out.</LD>
<TE>   "Other guys think they can contend with them, but they're just
kidding themselves. We're just second fiddles."</TE>
<TE>   Woods says Toms simply had a bad day.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like he was kind of struggling off the tee," Woods
said. "He made some good putts, but he missed a few too, which is not
like him. He'll fix it on the range. He's a great champion."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rees Jones oversaw the redesign of Hazeltine National, which is
the design of his late father, Robert Trent Jones. According to
Jones, the 16th hole may be the one that decides the championship.</TE>
<TE>   There is a lot of trouble on the 402-yard par four. The tee shot
has to carry 220 yards of Hazeltine Lake in order to reach the
fairway, which has water on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said the green is one of the original greens and is
double-tiered with undulations.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it; I think it's going to be very interesting," he said.</TE>
<TE>   John Daly might have used a different word to describe No. 16.</TE>
<TE>   The 1991 PGA champion made an 11 there, but unlike other times, he
didn't phone in the rest of his round. He earned comeback-of-the-day
honors when he recovered to shoot a 33 on his back nine for a 77.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ever wonder what golfers do during weather delays?</TE>
<TE>   Jim Furyk said that during Thursday's three-hour delay he read
some fiction in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I pretty much read all the stuff you guys wrote last week," Furyk
joked to the assembled media.</TE>
<TE>   When he got bored of ink-stained wretches, Furyk turned his
attention to the Golf Channel, which was replaying past PGA
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   "When I left, 'Zinger [Paul Azinger] was winning the '93 PGA. We
were making fun of everyone and the clothes we wore back then."</TE>
<TE>   Said Woods: "We ate a lot. We ate breakfast three times. Lunch
wasn't out yet."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lehman said, "I fell asleep."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ninety-eight of the world's top 100 golfers were in the field of
156, which made it tough going for club pros such as Kent Stauffer,
who shot 15-over 87.</TE>
<TE>   The top 25 club professionals received invitations for the PGA,
but Stauffer wishes he could have made a stronger showing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst that I have played in the five majors that I
have played in," said Stauffer, director of instruction at Carmel
Country Club in Charlotte, N.C.. "I don't know if you want to call it
not being prepared or letting the elements get to you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Had Fred Funk won last week's Buick Open--he tied for second--he
said he would have dedicated his sixth PGA Tour victory to his
57-year-old brother Bernie, who checked himself into a Florida
hospital to start rehabilitation after suffering from alcoholism and
depression for years.</TE>
<TE>   Should Funk go from sharing the opening-round lead to winning, the
former University of Maryland golf coach probably will credit his big
brother for giving him the courage to overcome the self-doubts that
have plagued Funk from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   "It has helped me, no question about it," Funk said. "To see a guy
who has been suffering admit that he needs help, that meant a lot to
me. It just makes you proud. Last week, I kept telling myself that my
brother has shown a lot of strength and that I could do the same when
it came to playing golf."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prize money for the 84th PGA Championship is a record $5.5
million, with $990,000 going to the winner. Last year, the purse was
$5.2 million and Toms made $936,000.</TE>

<LD>The rain gear is off, and so is the pressure for Tiger Woods in this
week's PGA Championship. There is no calendar-year Grand Slam at
stake, not since Scotland imported a monsoon and threw it at Woods in
the middle of last month's British Open.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, Hazeltine is just another major for Woods, another notch for
the belt, if and when, which means every stroke won't be dripping
with historical significance from here through the final hole Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The big pressure at Hazeltine surrounds the CBS lead analyst's
chair, which was vacated in June by Ken Venturi and is being filled,
for the first time at a major championship, by Lanny Wadkins.</LD>
<TE>   "It's hard to replace someone who's been involved in it as long as
he has and was as proficient at it as he was," Wadkins said of
Venturi during a conference call with reporters earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot of Kenny on tape, because I've got all the tapes
of the tournaments I've won--and he's done a lot of them. I've seen a
lot of his work for years and I've always respected what he's done,
not only his playing ability but also his announcing ability.</TE>
<TE>   "Trying to take over for him has been a big challenge. And I'm
very excited to be a part of that."</TE>
<TE>   Wadkins said he has had several dinners with Venturi, trying "to
pick his brain on things, ask him how he treated certain situations,
and he gave me some good advice.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing, and I really understood where he's coming from, is not
to just jump out and try to criticize somebody. He said one of the
first things you've got to do when you're looking at a situation
is--guys are going to hit bad shots. You can't always say, 'He made a
terrible mistake there,' because it may not be a mistake. It may be
that somebody just made a bad swing or hit a bad shot. And everybody
from Tiger Woods on down does that.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing I've got to discern, as Kenny pointed out, is
whether it was a bad decision or a poor swing. And if it's a bad
decision, then it's easy to be critical. If it's a bad swing, hell,
we all make those."</TE>
<TE>   Wadkins said he will pick his spots, but he will criticize. It's
part of the job, and it's a major reason CBS selected him as
Venturi's replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had a category for candor [on the PGA Tour], Lanny would
have led that stat every year," CBS lead golf announcer Jim Nantz
said. "He is unfailingly honest, and always has been."</TE>
<TE>   Wadkins, winner of the 1977 PGA Championship and 20 other PGA
tournaments, provided a sample when asked to pick a winner this
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   He said he supposed he could "take the traditional straightforward
pick and go with Tiger at this point in time--except I think he's
going to have to show a little more game than he showed last weekend
at the Buick [Open]. His game was not sharp by any stretch of the
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably the most impressive thing about his win was that he did
it on guts. It just shows the size of his heart and what's inside him
to win, because he was not striking the ball very well, especially
with his short irons. I think he'll be making some major
adjustments.... If he isn't successful in those, he's going to have a
very difficult time this week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Coulda Been Championship</TE>
<TE>   Had Woods not shot 81 during that rain-soaked third-round at
Muirfield and rallied to win the British Open, Nantz believes this
week's PGA Championship "would be the biggest and most significant
golf tournament of the modern era. This would be as big as it gets
for this game. It would have been off the charts....</TE>
<TE>   "That's not to say that this doesn't have true significance and a
whole lot of issues that will be settled this week. Imagine if Ernie
Els backs up his win at the British Open with a win here.... If Ernie
won this major and went back-to-back, you suddenly go from a year
that looked like it might be the impossible calendar Slam for Tiger
Woods to where you're now saying and asking, 'Who's the player of the
year?'</TE>
<TE>   "Tiger has two majors and Ernie [would have] two majors. All kinds
of possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Big Deal For Tennis</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe works as a tennis analyst
for CBS and ESPN, but he believes USA Network's recent move to expand
its tennis coverage beginning next year is good for the sport.</TE>
<TE>   The six-year, $125-million deal will enable USA to extend its
contract to cover early-round U.S. Open competition as well as
televising six to eight summer tournaments leading to the Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a really big step forward," McEnroe said. "I really
believe that's the way we need to go. The Grand Slams, let's face it,
have the power and the money. [The networks] need to step up and put
some of these deals together.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can create a deal where you get more of these
[tournaments] on TV and there's a regularity to them, a
predictability--'Hey, every Sunday, we're going to have this
final.'--it's better for the viewing public....</TE>
<TE>   "It'd be nice if there were a little more continuity in the
coverage. It'd be nice for ESPN and USA to make some long-term
deals--at least there's a little more predictability, so that you
know where the [telecast] is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How About 'Popcorn Machine Place?'</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles city councilman Nick Pacheco is asking Laker fans for
input in naming a street near Staples Center after Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Pacheco proposed that 11th Street between Cherry and
Figueroa be renamed Chick Hearn Lane, but has since decided to enlist
help from the public.</TE>
<TE>   At Pacheco's Web site, fans can vote for one of four
choices--Chick Hearn Lane, Chick Hearn Court, Chick Hearn's Place,
Chick Hearn's Dribble Drive--or submit their suggestions. The city
council and mayor will eventually determine which name will be used.</TE>
<TE>   Fans can vote at www.lacity.org/council/cd14/, or by sending an
e-mail to vhernandcouncil.lacity.org.</TE>

<TE>   Irv Kaze Memorial</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service for longtime sportscaster Irv Kaze will be held
Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Turf Club at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Kaze, who died of a heart attack June 29, was a six-time winner of
the Southern California Sports Broadcasters' Best Talk Show Host
award.</TE>
<TE>   Before hosting his weekly interview show on KRLA-AM (870), Kaze
had a lengthy career as a front-office executive with such teams as
the Angels, Clippers, Los Angeles Raiders, San Diego Chargers and New
York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Stu Nahan, SCSB president, will conduct the service, heading a

<HD>They'll Try to Avoid a Dead End</HD>

<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time again for UCLA to begin, which is rarely a problem. The
end, fraught as it has been with deceit, treachery and mind-boggling
miscalculations--not to mention repeated humiliation at the hands of
USC--looms like an ominous storm far down a long highway.</LD>
<LD>   But for now it's only sunshine, and an insular suburban sunshine
at that. The Bruins open camp Saturday at Cal Lutheran, a small
private university 40 miles northwest of UCLA tucked beside rocky
hills in Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   It's a getaway, to be sure, to the same sleepy campus the Dallas
Cowboys used as training camp from 1963-89. There are two reasons
UCLA will train outside of Westwood for the first time: Spaulding
Field needs time to mend after getting torn up by a stream of summer
camps, and the Bruins want a respite from the distractions of UCLA in
late August.</LD>
<TE>   "Our campus is a zoo," Coach Bob Toledo said. "There is
construction going on, there are cheerleader camps, people running
all over the place. This gives us a chance to develop unity and focus
on football in a quiet environment."</TE>
<TE>   Desiring a setting as tranquil as a therapist's office is
understandable. The collective Bruin psyche became as battered as
Spaulding Field last season when UCLA lost four consecutive games
after a 6-0 start, free-falling from the rankings and down the
Pacific 10 Conference standings.</TE>
<TE>   Even a season-ending victory over Arizona State could not wash
away the bitter taste of a 27-0 loss to USC and the off-the-field
problems of tailback DeShaun Foster and quarterback Cory Paus.</TE>
<TE>   Foster, a leading Heisman Trophy candidate, was penalized by the
NCAA for driving a vehicle that did not belong to him and was
suspended for the last four games. Paus, a gritty competitor who
battled a thumb injury all season, failed to inform Toledo of two
off-season convictions for driving under the influence.</TE>
<TE>   Those incidents unfolded amid losses to Stanford, Washington
State, Oregon and the cross-town rival Trojans, and called into
question Toledo's control of the program. Doubts linger, and the
coach is under the microscope of new Athletic Director Dan Guerrero.</TE>
<TE>   A key issue will be the fitness of Paus, a senior who is within
reach of several school records but whose late-season tailspin on the
field and lack of judgment off it make him a question mark.</TE>
<TE>   "Our rapport is good," Toledo said. "I'm willing to forgive and
forget. We have an understanding. He can't afford to make any more
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The short leash might be wishful thinking. Toledo must exhibit
patience with Paus because there doesn't appear to be another viable
option at quarterback. Paus' backups are redshirt freshman John
Sciarra and incoming freshmen Matt Moore and Drew Olson. The fates of
the beleaguered coach and errant quarterback might be inextricably
linked.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, this is a season of reckoning. In the last three years,
UCLA is 17-17 and only 3-7 in November and December, with three
losses to USC.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin schedule is murderous, ranked second in difficulty by a
national magazine. And a roster that lost 23 seniors, 11 of them
starters, must tackle it.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder UCLA is nowhere to be found in the rankings and was
picked to finish sixth in a Pac-10 media poll.</TE>
<TE>   There are considerable strengths, however. The offensive line
returns nearly intact, Paus has a brigade of talented receivers, the
defensive line is solid and defensive backs Ricky Manning Jr. and
Matt Ware are among the best in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Replacing Foster's yards and integrating exciting newcomers Junior
Taylor, Marcedes Lewis and Tyler Ebell are the biggest challenges on
offense. Replacing All-American middle linebacker Robert Thomas is
the toughest task on defense.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA season-ticket holders were surprised this week when they
received their packets and saw that tickets to the Bruins' game
against USC were priced at $28 less than those for the game against
Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out the prices are a mistake that probably originated
when the Washington State game was moved from Nov. 16 to Dec. 7 to
accommodate national television.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's long-standing policy has been to increase ticket prices for
more desirable home games, and none is more desirable than the
cross-town rivalry. But the price on the tickets that went out to
season-ticket holders for the game against the Trojans on Nov. 23 is
$30. Tickets for the Washington State game read $58.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the opposite is true, which anyone buying single-game
tickets will discover. Season-ticket holders will receive e-mails in
the next few days explaining the error, which did not change the
value of the season packages.</TE>
<TE>   "They are valid tickets," said Ken Weiner, associate athletic
director. "If anyone has a problem with it, we'll reissue the tickets
individually."</TE>

<HD>Polamalu, Who Usually Gives, Receives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Polamalu of USC regularly metes out punishment as one of the
most ferocious tacklers in college football.</LD>
<LD>   But the All-American safety was on the receiving end of two hard
shots Thursday when the Trojans donned full pads for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   Polamalu was cut down on a crack-back block in the morning and was
shaken after a hard collision with running back Justin Fargas in the
afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Polamalu was evaluated for a concussion after the Fargas hit and
will be examined today before the Trojans resume preparations for
their Sept. 2 opener against Auburn at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine," Polamalu said about 30 minutes after practice.</TE>
<TE>   Tempers flared momentarily in the morning after cornerback Kevin
Arbet failed to warn Polamalu of an oncoming hit by receiver Grant
Mattos during a full-squad drill near the end zone. Polamalu grabbed
Arbet by the facemask and the players exchanged words until teammates
and Coach Pete Carroll separated them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my fault. I messed up," Arbet said. "We're supposed to
protect our teammates."</TE>
<TE>   During a play near the end of afternoon practice, conducted with
players wearing shorts rather than full pads, Fargas swept right and
crashed into Polamalu.</TE>
<TE>   "Fargas wobbled and Troy wobbled," Carroll said. "It was a pretty
good pop."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he was pleased overall with his players'
aggressiveness. But injuries are mounting after only four days of
training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Three projected starters were among the players who sat out all or
part of practice Thursday because of injuries: senior offensive
lineman Zach Wilson (foot strain), who was injured Monday, junior
linebacker Melvin Simmons (ankle sprain) and senior cornerback
Darrell Rideaux (knee tendinitis). Others were junior linebacker
Chris Prosser (possible concussion), freshman defensive lineman
LaJuan Ramsey (hyper-extended left elbow) and junior defensive
lineman Daniel Urquhart (neck soreness).</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Sultan McCullough, the Trojans' leading rusher the
last two seasons, is nursing a sore left hamstring. Junior cornerback
Marcell Allmond, who is contending for a starting role, spent a
second night in the hospital for an infection in his right knee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McCullough took more repetitions than the previous two days and
accelerated powerfully for a 10-yard touchdown during the morning
workout. But McCullough said he still intends to see a doctor outside
the school's athletic department for his hamstring problem....
Carroll said the Trojans will scrimmage for the first time Saturday.
The Trojans will also scrimmage Monday at the Coliseum. All practices
are closed to the public.</TE>

<HD>One Tough Grandmother</HD>
<DH>New USOC President Mankamyer has critics, but supporters
say she's a fighter with the political skills to handle the job</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marty Mankamyer, a 68-year-old grandmother of seven and
self-described "soccer mom," was elected president of the U.S.
Olympic Committee on Thursday, a development that backers insisted
would bode well for the USOC but others bemoaned as prime evidence of
a systemic malaise plaguing the most important national Olympic
committee in the world.</LD>
<LD>   Mankamyer, a real estate broker in Colorado Springs, Colo., was
elected with a majority of ballots returned by the USOC's 123-member
board of directors. Hers was the only name on the ballot. Under the
USOC's rules for this election, she had earned the right to be the
sole candidate submitted for ratification, having earlier bested USOC
Vice President Paul George and former USOC treasurer Larry Hough.</LD>
<LD>   Mankamyer is filling the remainder of the term vacated by Sandra
Baldwin and will serve through 2004. Baldwin, a Phoenix real estate
executive, resigned May 24 after acknowledging discrepancies in her
official USOC biography. Mankamyer, who had been USOC secretary and
acting president since Baldwin's resignation, has pledged not to
serve as president beyond 2004.</LD>
<TE>   Insiders have long regarded Mankamyer as a shrewd political
infighter who is unfazed by challenges and knows well the USOC's
bureaucracy, factions and history. She has risen from a hardscrabble
upbringing and domestic abuse, and played a key role in securing a
spot for women's soccer in the Olympic Games.</TE>
<TE>   For many observers of the Olympic scene, however, her election
crystallizes an issue that some frame this way: Is a 68-year-old
grandmother truly the best this country could tab for the top job
with the world's top Olympic committee? This, after all, is the same
organization that a generation ago boasted as leaders the likes of
the legendary Col. F. Don Miller, who served as USOC executive
director for 12 years, and William E. Simon, whose USOC presidency
followed his service as secretary of the treasury in the Nixon and
Ford administrations. Simon oversaw the L.A. Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Sandy Baldwin followed by Marty Mankamyer tells you how
pathetic the USOC is," said a leading American sports official who
has long been close to the Olympic movement. "That it can't get
anybody of real stature or real accomplishment to be president just
reflects the excessive influence of the grass-roots organizations on
the process. There's no understanding of professionalism or of
today's international sports world."</TE>
<TE>   Mankamyer takes such remarks in stride. Earlier this week, she was
asked, "Are you truly the best choice in the whole country for this
position?" She replied, "The answer is, my peers believe in me. They
know I know the issues. That I'm tough. That I'm relentless. I am
unafraid to face the tough issues. I am as hard as nails. I may not
look it. But, oh my gosh, you don't want to tangle with me."</TE>
<TE>   Mankamyer assumes the presidency as the USOC confronts a series of
formidable hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most important, it is struggling to define its central
mission.</TE>
<TE>   Is it to produce Olympic medal winners?</TE>
<TE>   Or is the USOC akin to a public trust, charged with producing
medal winners as an adjunct to promoting the idealism and values of
the Olympic movement?</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, there is renewed tension between the
professional staff, many based at the USOC's campus in Colorado
Springs, and the volunteer corps that makes up the board of directors
and sustains the Olympic enterprise in the far corners of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The USOC's chief executive officer, Lloyd Ward, while
acknowledging the import of the medal-winning mission, has pushed the
power of the staff at the expense of the volunteers--even as, for
most of the last year, he has been flying around the country,
promoting a campaign that he says is aimed at winning the "hearts and
minds" of ordinary Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Ward's future at the USOC is by no means assured.</TE>
<TE>   His campaign has not been warmly embraced in all quarters,
particularly as the agencies that run Olympic sports--called national
governing bodies--cast about for funds to help support would-be
Olympic athletes. The Athens Summer Games begin two years from this
week.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in years, the USOC is facing tremendous
financial uncertainty. Its annual budget runs to nearly $125 million,
and its revenues have steadily risen over the last two decades
through marketing connected to a string of Olympics staged in the
United States--Lake Placid (Winter, 1980), Los Angeles (Summer,
1984), Atlanta (Summer, 1996) and Salt Lake City (Winter, 2002).</TE>
<TE>   The earliest the Games can return to the United States will be
2012, and although four U.S. cities are vying for those Summer Games,
the odds of the European-dominated International Olympic Committee
returning to the U.S. in 2012 appear long. The IOC will award the
2012 Games in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Mankamyer has, she admits, limited international stature
and little knowledge of the IOC's complex politics.</TE>
<TE>   Dale Neuberger, president of USA Swimming, said, "Over the last
several weeks, as people have had a chance to know Marty better, she
has impressed even some of her critics with the depth of her
knowledge of the Olympic movement and her commitment to the success
of the USOC.</TE>
<TE>   "She is very bright. She is very articulate. And I think that she
brings a certain freshness to this effort by firmly placing the USOC
first, above personal ambitions."</TE>
<TE>   Added Michael Lenard, a Los Angeles businessman and 1984 Olympian
who ran unsuccessfully for the USOC presidency in 1996, "For those
who do not know Marty, they will find her to be a strong and
principled team player. She will neither cut sleazy political deals
nor feather her own ego nest."</TE>
<TE>   Mankamyer grew up in Farmington, N.M. She attended the University
of New Mexico for two years, then transferred to UCLA, then withdrew
to get married.</TE>
<TE>   Her first marriage ended in divorce. She remarried.</TE>
<TE>   Living in Colorado, she endured, she said, bouts of domestic
violence. Once after a fight with her then-husband, she said, she was
left in a field north of Denver, her white clothes stained with blood
and dirt. She still bears on her right shin the scar--167
stitches--from another incident during which, she said, she was
thrown through a patio door.</TE>
<TE>   "As I said, I've been there. You can't scare me," Mankamyer said.</TE>
<TE>   After splitting from her second husband, Mankamyer said, she
worked two jobs to support herself and her children--a day job as a
secretary and a night job, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., at a bar in Westminster,
Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, she turned to real estate. She also met her third
husband, Jack Mankamyer. They have been married 25 years. Their
blended family totals seven children, ages 24 to 41, and seven
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I say how proud I am of my kids?" she asked. "Because I think
that's the testimony to whether you've been a success in life."</TE>
<TE>   Mankamyer enjoys riding horses. As a young woman, she said, she
used to race stock cars at a track near Denver, and she's more than
comfortable around a shooting range. Jack Mankamyer once gave her a
12-gauge shotgun as an anniversary gift.</TE>
<TE>   "I like guns," she said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Her sports experience began as a soccer mom carpooling to practice
and games. Rising through the sport's bureaucracy, she was elected
chairman of the U.S. Youth Soccer Assn. in 1984. That position made
her a vice president of U.S. Soccer.</TE>
<TE>   She became a member of the USOC board of directors in 1990, served
on the USOC's policy-making executive committee from 1992-96 and in
2000 was elected secretary. She served as assistant chef de mission
for the U.S. team at the Sydney Games two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   She expressed confidence and a let's-get-to-it spirit as she took
over the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a weak spot," she said, "unless it's my image, that
I look like a grandmother."</TE>
<TE>   But she also said of that image, with a knowing laugh, "It has
gotten me a lot of places because the facade is so beautiful."</TE>

Sandoval will move up to Fukuzaki's weekend spot. Fukuzaki will
replace Weir as the host of "Monday Night Live."</LD>

Late Game," but the shows were not picked up by USA Network.</LD>

"I should know within a few months what I'll be doing next."</TE>

<HD>Holdsclaw Lifts Mystics to First Playoff Victory</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For Chamique Holdsclaw, it has been a long time coming.</LD>
<LD>   Four years after being selected No. 1 in the WNBA draft, Holdsclaw
finally has a playoff victory. Her 26 points, 13 rebounds and five
steals helped the Washington Mystics defeat the Charlotte Sting,
74-62, Thursday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   It was also the first playoff win in the Mystics' five-year
existence, ending a drought that seemed longer for such veterans as
Holdsclaw and Tausha Mills. Earlier, Marianne Stanley was named the
league's coach of the year.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel so blessed, man," said Holdsclaw, flashing a broad smile.
"Since I've been in Washington, it's been up and down. Tausha made a
comment in the locker room just now--'Hey, first time we've had a
coach of the year, and the coach is actually favored to come back
next year.' It feels good just to have stability for once, and it's
something that's just going to grow."</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte, seeded second in the East, will play host to the
Mystics in Game 2 of the best-of-three series on Saturday and Game 3,
if necessary, on Monday. The Sting defeated the Mystics, 67-57,
Tuesday in Charlotte to gain homecourt advantage for the series.</TE>
<TE>   The victory broke a six-game home losing streak for the
third-seeded Mystics, who had lost nine of 11 to end the season. The
Sting had won four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The Mystics, who finished the regular season with a winning record
(17-15) for the first time in their history, were swept in two games
by New York in 2000 in their only other playoff appearance.</TE>
