<HD>Japanese Drivers Have Yen for Purchasing Volkswagens</HD>
<DH>Mercedes-Benz is second in import sales in the nation whose
passenger vehicles are tops in the U.S.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We know that American car buyers, especially those in Southern
California, like Toyotas and Hondas--a lot. The Accord and Camry
routinely top all other mid-size passenger vehicles in annual sales.</LD>
<LD>   But what about the Japanese? Ever wonder which import brands they
prefer?</LD>
<LD>   A recent issue of the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Assn.'s
monthly newsletter says that Volkswagen is by far the most popular
brand, accounting for 61,121 of the 269,088 imports sold in Japan
last year.</LD>
<TE>   Mercedes-Benz is second with 53,207 vehicles, followed by BMW with
36,253.</TE>
<TE>   In fourth place was Ford Motor Co.'s Volvo brand at 16,437. Opel,
a European unit of General Motors Corp., finished fifth with 12,626
Japanese sales.</TE>
<TE>   France's Peugot was sixth with 12,295 sales; VW-owned Audi was
seventh with 8,127; Chrysler was eighth with 7,646; Ford, with 6,186,
was ninth; and in 10th place, with 4,977 sales, was Italy's Alfa
Romeo.</TE>
<TE>   Imports--from non-Japanese car makers as well as from the overseas
factories of Toyota, Honda and Isuzu--accounted for 6.3% of the
nearly 4.3 million cars sold in Japan last year, the association
reported.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, imports from Asia and Europe account for about 20% of
passenger car and light-truck sales in the U.S. And import brand
vehicles assembled in the U.S. account for an additional 18%.</TE>

<HD>'Crossovers' Steal the N.Y. Show</HD>
<DH>The car-based vehicles and SUVs play a big role at the
international auto exhibition as car makers continue to pump new
products into the fastest-growing market in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>New York</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Light trucks, among the most profitable of the auto
industry's offerings, represented more than half the U.S. passenger
vehicle market last year. And auto makers aren't slowing down in
bringing out more trucks and "crossovers," which combine features of
sport utility vehicles, minivans and passenger cars.</LD>
<LD>   The latest batch of light trucks, heavy with crossovers, was
unveiled at the New York International Auto Show, which ended Sunday.
Ford's Lincoln division grabbed much of the attention with the
Aviator, an upscale sibling of the Explorer (Business, March 27).
Lincoln hopes the Aviator and the larger Navigator, newly redesigned
for 2003, will appeal enough to consumers to pull the luxury brand
out of the sales trough it has been wallowing in for more than a
year.</LD>
<LD>   A rundown of other key SUVs and crossovers introduced in New York
shows that U.S. consumers looking for something other than a standard
sedan will have a growing number of choices to make in the next year.</LD>
<TE>   Mitsubishi Outlander: This new compact crossover is an entry-level
vehicle that expands Mitsubishi's truck lineup. Mitsubishi likens its
utility to that of a Swiss Army knife, but its distinguishing feature
seems to be its relatively high seating position with respect to its
overall low profile</TE>
<TE>   . The 2003 Outlander features a 2.4-liter, inline-4 engine that
produces 140 horsepower and peak torque of 157 pound-feet at only
2,500 revolutions per minute, making for brisk acceleration.</TE>
<TE>   Four-wheel independent suspension, two-tone paint schemes and
clear taillight lenses complement the package.</TE>
<TE>   "Outlander is a spirited five-passenger sport [utility] for the
young at heart who crave a stylish vehicle that's equipped to handle
the challenges of an energetic urban and outdoor lifestyle," said
Pierre Gagnon, president of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America.</TE>
<TE>   That sounds like the spin for a lot of other vehicles, but the
Outlander's stylish design could catch on with buyers who want a
restrained but rugged look coupled with optional all-wheel drive.
Pricing and a sales date will come later.</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu Ascender: The 2003 Ascender will replace the Trooper as
Isuzu Motor Ltd.'s flagship SUV, offering a full-size vehicle with
three rows of seating for seven passengers as standard equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The largest and most powerful Isuzu SUV, the Ascender offers a
choice of a 4.2-liter, inline-6 engine producing 275 horsepower, or a
5.3-liter V-8 with 285 horsepower but considerably more towing
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Isuzu is 49% owned by General Motors Corp., and the Ascender is
the first Isuzu truck to have GM's OnStar communications and
emergency notification system. It will be built in Ohio alongside the
Chevrolet TrailBlazer and GMC Envoy, with which Ascender shares its
platform. And the Ascender comes with Isuzu's 10-year, 120,000-mile
powertrain protection. Pricing was not announced.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan Murano: Named after an island near Venice, Italy, the 2003
Murano is a five-seat crossover with Nissan's powerful and
well-received 3.5-liter V-6, the same 240-plus horsepower engine used
in the Altima and Maxima. Technological options include a new
all-wheel drive system and, for the first time in North America,
Nissan's continuously variable transmission, which offers an infinite
number of gear ratios that change constantly to keep the engine
operating in its most efficient range.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan hopes Murano's styling, highlighted by a dramatically
curved rear cargo door, will set it apart. Inside features include a
lockable center console that can hold a laptop computer, and
reclining rear seats that can be remotely controlled.</TE>
<TE>   The Murano joins an increasingly crowded mid-size crossover
segment. It goes on sale in November at an as-yet undecided price.
Nissan hopes to steal sales from the Toyota Highlander and Honda
Pilot and the more luxurious Lexus RX 300.</TE>
<TE>   Honda Element: This was first shown as a concept vehicle called
the Model X at the Detroit auto show last year. Now, Honda has come
out with the production version (Highway 1, March 27), toned down a
little on the inside and jazzed up a little on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   The Element catches the eye with its unusual two-tone color scheme
(the contrasting color is at the corners and along the edges of the
roof) and a boxy design you'll either love or hate.</TE>
<TE>   Aimed at the youth market, which Honda vaguely identifies as 71
million consumers, the Element is a "dorm room on wheels" that can be
easily cleaned and reconfigured for various uses by different users.</TE>
<TE>   Access is through "clamshell" doors that swing wide with no
central support pillar to block the opening.</TE>
<TE>   The seats flip out of the way, the floor is plastic so it can be
hosed off after a day at the beach, and Honda says the entertainment
system will enable occupants to play video games and listen to music
on MP3 files.</TE>
<TE>   It seats eight and is powered by Honda's 2.4-liter, 160-horsepower
inline-4 engine with a five-speed automatic transmission. When it
goes on sale in December for $16,000 to $21,000, Honda promises it
will get good fuel economy with low emissions--a Honda specialty.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler Pacifica: Chrysler calls the production version of this
crossover a "sports tourer." It was first shown as a concept three
months ago at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit,
with strong hints it would make it onto dealers' lots. Chrysler says
it will be a 2004 model. True to the crossover mold, the Pacifica has
a low entry point but high seating. It also has three rows of seats
designed for just six passengers--two bucket seats in the middle row
for greater comfort.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacifica will be powered by the same 3.5-liter V-6 that's used
in the 300M sedan. It will be built in Windsor, Canada, alongside
Chrysler minivans, but company executives point out that it won't use
a minivan platform. It goes on sale in spring of 2003 with pricing
expected to start around $25,000.</TE>

<HD>Chrysler Recalls 640,000 Cars in 2 Campaigns</HD>
<DH>Moves involve patch in 1997 minivans, ignition module
short-circuits in 2001 Jeep Wranglers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chrysler Group unit of German-American auto maker Daimler
Chrysler is recalling 640,000 vehicles in two separate campaigns that
were announced last week but overshadowed by General Motors Corp.'s
much larger and news-making recall of 1.9 million cars to repair a
potentially faulty ignition switch.</LD>
<LD>   Toyota, Pontiac and Mazda also issued recalls this month.</LD>
<LD>   Chrysler's recall involves 545,311 Chrysler, Dodge and Plymouth
minivans from the 1997 model year and 95,000 Jeep Wranglers from the
2001 model year.</LD>
<TE>   The minivans are being called in to replace a plastic patch, or
plug, that covers an access hole in the rear, or "D" pillar. The
company said the patch could fall off the pillar and into the rear
seat belt mechanism, keeping the belts from latching securely.</TE>
<TE>   The Jeep recall involves Wrangler models made from June 2000 to
December 2001. Chrysler said a potential fire problem exists because
of reports of short-circuits in the ignition module.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler was to begin mailing notices to owners of affected Jeep
vehicles this week.</TE>
<TE>   Mazda is recalling 14,000 MPV minivans built from November 2001 to
February 2002, and sold as '02 models. The gross vehicle weight
limit--which helps determine several critical factors including
minimum tire sizes--was listed incorrectly on labels affixed to the
vehicles. A corrected label will be installed. Mazda said it would
begin notifying affected vehicle owners this month.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota is recalling 8,483 Corollas and Pontiac is recalling 2,701
of its new Vibe crossover wagon--both to fix improperly tightened
rear wheel bolts. The rear wheel bolts were not tightened
sufficiently at the factory and could come loose, causing noises and,
if all four came loose, separation of the wheel and brake assembly
from the rear axle.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicles use the same platform and were built in January and
February at the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. plant in Northern
California that is owned by GM and Toyota. The companies said they
began notifying owners last month.Separately, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration's monthly reminder of previously
announced automotive recalls--issued to alert vehicle owners who
might have missed the initial notices--shows that in February:</TE>
<TE>   * DaimlerChrysler recalled 1.62million Jeep Grand Cherokees
manufactured from June 1992 to May 1998 because those Jeeps can roll
backward if the gear shift isn't fully in the "park" position and the
engine is running. The agency is investigating five deaths in
connection with that vehicle. Jeep dealers will add a secondary
"park" position locking mechanism. Chrysler was to begin notifying
owners late last month.</TE>
<TE>   * DaimlerChrysler recalled 316,148 Jeep Wranglers equipped with
manual transmissions and manufactured from July 1989 to December
1995. The Wranglers, sold as 1990 through 1995 models, have parking
brakes that can disengage after being set, allowing the vehicles to
roll if parked on an incline. The repair involves installing a
stronger spring in the parking brake locking mechanism. Chrysler said
that it would begin notifying owners this month.</TE>
<TE>   * Chrysler's Dodge unit recalled 268,740 full-size Ram pickup
trucks from the 2001 model year, built from January to August 2000,
to fix an electrical connection that can come loose and cause a fire.
Owner notification was to begin by early May.</TE>
<TE>   * Nissan Motor Co. recalled 39,000 Nissan Maximas and Infiniti
I35s, all 2002 models, because a defect in the electronic accelerator
system can cause them to slow unexpectedly. Notification was to begin
this month.</TE>
<TE>   * BMW recalled 4,672 of its 2002 model year 325i , 525i and 530i
models manufactured in November 2001, for repair of an improperly
secured front strut bearing that could cause the strut to separate
from its mount, impairing vehicle handling and control. Owner
notification was to begin this month.</TE>

<HD>2-Million-Mile Man Still Is Cruising Strong in His 1966
Volvo</HD>
<DH>Regular oil changes--and a love of driving--earn the P1800
and its driver a place in history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irv Gordon's car just might be the most-traveled passenger car of
modern times, which makes his tips for automotive longevity--stay out
of accidents and change the oil often--well worth listening to.</LD>
<LD>   It's been 36 years and a record 2 million miles since the retired
science teacher walked into a Long Island, N.Y., Volvo dealership in
1966 and drove out in a new P1800 sports coupe.</LD>
<LD>   An inveterate driver, Gordon says he put 1,500 miles on the car in
the first 48 hours he owned it. Thanks in part to a 125-mile daily
commute, he hit 250,000 miles in 1971 and by October 1987 had logged
1 million miles.</LD>
<TE>   Gordon's sporty red Volvo made it into the Guinness Book of World
Records in 1998 as the car with "the highest certified mileage driven
by the original owner in noncommercial service."</TE>
<TE>   It got there, Gordon said, because he changed the oil every 3,000
miles and rigorously adhered to Volvo's recommended maintenance
schedule. And because he loves to drive.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't stop with the Guinness record.</TE>
<TE>   A man who once said he found nothing unusual about picking up a
lunch date at 9 a.m. so they could make it from New York to a
restaurant in Montreal by noon, Gordon last month became the first
private motorist to log 2 million miles in one car.</TE>
<TE>   That's an average of 55,555 miles a year.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon said his records show he's done 667 oil changes, replaced
400 spark plugs, installed 80 new tires and pumped 6,400 tanks of gas
into the Volvo. The car had its engine rebuilt at 600,000 miles, but
still is using the original transmission and rear end.</TE>
<TE>   Volvo Cars, not shy about the opportunity to brag, has feted
Gordon and his P1800 on numerous occasions and staged the
2-million-mile event at a March 28 party in New York celebrating
Volvo's 75th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   We caught Gordon and his Volvo last week when he arrived in
Universal City to prepare for a guest appearance on car buff Jay
Leno's "Tonight Show" on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   As for what happens next, "I'll keep on driving," said Gordon, 61.
He voiced uncertainty, though, about his ability to become the
3-million-mile-man. "The car shows no signs of giving up," he said,
"but I'm not so sure about me."</TE>

<HD>Lack of Accident Evidence Can Alter the Truth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RALPH VARTABEDIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I was recently rear-ended when I changed lanes. Luckily
nobody was hurt, but the police found me at fault. When I attempted
to find out why, the police officer said I caused the accident by
making an unlawful lane change.</LD>
<LD>   I believe the other driver was speeding, but the police said there
was no evidence of his speeding. This seems crazy to me. How can I be
at fault?</LD>
<LD>   C.F.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Investigations of lane-change accidents often are
difficult because of a lack of obvious evidence. Also, police are
reluctant to spend much time looking into an accident in which no
injuries occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, you are entitled to make a lane change based on
the assumption that other vehicles behind you are driving at a legal
speed, said Bill Edmonds, a private accident investigator and
longtime accident specialist with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   But hasty police investigations often disregard this fundamental
premise, looking for a single action that a driver took that directly
led to the accident. This action is known as the primary collision
factor. In a lane-change accident, it's far easier to blame the
driver changing lanes.</TE>
<TE>   "Often, the easiest one to prove is not the correct cause,"
Edmonds said.</TE>
<TE>   The same type of investigation mistake typically occurs in
accidents when drivers make turns and enter intersections from stop
signs. They misjudge the distance of oncoming vehicles because the
vehicles are traveling at illegal speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Police often consider investigating non-injury accidents as
drudgery that serves only the interests of the insurance industry.
They typically do not take skid-mark measurements, make only cursory
examinations of accident damage on vehicles and make no effort to
interview witnesses. Their conclusions usually are based on driver
statements.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't much you can do about it. Most police officers and
police investigators refuse to reconsider their conclusions after
their report is filed.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have twice had the idle air control assembly replaced under
warranty on my 1999 Toyota RAV4, which has about 30,000 miles on it.</TE>
<TE>   Dealership representatives have informed me on both visits that
it's a known problem that carbon builds up on the part, causing it to
malfunction.</TE>
<TE>   My warranty expires in June and I am concerned that the part will
fail again, costing me $300 each time. Based on my experience, the
part will need to be replaced every 15,000 miles. What can you
suggest?</TE>
<TE>   K.C.</TE>
<TE>   A: Toyota has not issued any technical service bulletins on that
problem, so it is not a well-recognized issue by the company itself.
Nonetheless, mechanics already may have figured out that the part has
a higher-than-normal failure rate, and that is what they passed on to
you.</TE>
<TE>   The idle air control assembly is attached to the engine's throttle
body, which is the main element of the fuel injection system. The
device has a solenoid-operated valve that regulates the amount of air
going through the throttle body, thereby controlling the engine's
idle speed, according to Alldata, a major publisher of automotive
repair and diagnostic information.</TE>
<TE>   The part, an item typically sold only by dealers, has a list price
of $198.54 and should take about 11/2 hours of labor to replace,
according to the Alldata rate book. At a standard $60-an-hour rate,
that would add up to $90 for labor. So, the $300 price tag you
mention is right on the mark of what you are looking at if the part
goes bad again.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, aftermarket manufacturers will see a big business in
making the part, if indeed RAV4s are dying all over the place because
of a defect. That should bring the price down on the part. But that
doesn't help in the near term.</TE>
<TE>   It is not unusual for fuel injection throttle bodies or various
parts associated with the throttle body to become contaminated with
carbon buildup. In general, there are procedures for cleaning the
carbon without having to replace the parts, and this may be possible
for the part that has caused you problems.</TE>
<TE>   Your letter suggests Toyota customer service has not responded to
repeated efforts by you to get some clarification about the future
warranty coverage on the part. But you should keep trying. Toyota
recently extended the warranty for sludge damage on its engines after
customers raised a stink about what they considered a defect.</TE>
<TE>   In general, dealerships will cover certain parts after warranty if
you have established that the car was being repaired for a known
condition during the warranty period. This may help for the next
replacement, though at some point you are clearly going to be on your
own.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Master Chorale has announced programming for its
2002-03 season. The 39th season of the choral group, one of the Los
Angeles Music Center's resident performing arts companies, marks its
final year at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion before moving to the new Walt
Disney Concert Hall, which opens in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The season, which opens Sept. 29 at the Chandler Pavilion, will be
highlighted by a Nov. 10 performance at another new downtown
architectural landmark: the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,
designed by Rafael Moneo. The concert, part of the subscription
series, will be the first professional performance at the cathedral,
currently under construction and scheduled to open in September.</LD>
<LD>   The chorale also is expanding the subscription series to eight
concerts, all to be directed by chorale music director Grant Gershon.
Four concerts will be accompanied by the Master Chorale Orchestra.</LD>
<TE>   The subscription programs feature works by eight living composers,
including the world premiere of Tania Leon's "Rezos" (Prayers) in an
all-Latin American program on March 8. Other subscription season
offerings include Verdi's "Te Deum," Britten's "Cantata
misericordium," Stravinsky's "Les Noces" (The Wedding), Gorecki's
"Amen" and Reich's "The Desert Music." The final subscription concert
of the season, on June 7, 2003, is titled "It's a Wrap!" and features
choral music from the movies.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 15 concert, "Sounds of the Season," marks the first
concert in a six-year cycle of cantatas from Bach's "Christmas
Oratorio." The chorale will present its 22nd annual nonsubscription
Messiah Sing-Along on Dec. 16, conducted for the first time by
Gershon.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the chorale will make its first East Coast appearances
since 1986. The schedule includes performing with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in fully staged performances of John Adams' "El Nino" at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the Lincoln Center Great
Performances series, as well as an a cappella concert of Latin
American music at a venue to be announced.</TE>

<HD>At 67, Sax Man Enters New Phase of Life</HD>
<DH>Jazz* Gato Barbieri has remarried and relaunched his career
after losing his first wife and surviving his own serious illness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD HARRINGTON</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Now, I am in the best moment of life," says tenor saxophonist Gato
Barbieri from his home in New York as his 4-year-old son, Christian,
scampers noisily in the background.</LD>
<LD>   It's not just the pleasure of being a father at 67 but the
survival it symbolizes that bolsters Barbieri's spirits. In 1995,
such a prospect seemed unthinkable for the Argentina-born jazzman.
Michelle, his wife of 35 years and his manager and musical confidant,
succumbed to cancer she had battled for more than a decade; during
that time, Barbieri pretty much stopped recording and touring to care
for her.</LD>
<LD>   Back at work soon after her death, Barbieri stepped off the stage
in Washington suffering from chest pains; the next morning he was at
George Washington University Hospital undergoing triple-bypass heart
surgery.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, just four months later, Barbieri was back on stage in
Washington with his customary signatures: the flowing scarf and
fedora outfit, the multifaceted repertoire and the robust tenor and
bracingly wide-open, emotionally charged sound.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the credit goes to the physical therapist he ended up
marrying. "When I started to play again, Laura showed me many things
to do to have that kind of energy, because it is not easy, this
triple bypass," Barbieri says. "She helped me a lot."</TE>
<TE>   So did some surgery on his saxophone. Early in his career,
Barbieri had grafted the neck of a Selmer onto the body of a Conn
saxophone, the smaller neck increasing the airflow and allowing
Barbieri to blow hard with a very soft No. 1 reed.</TE>
<TE>   The original impetus was superstition: Saxophones were hard to
come by in Argentina in the '50s and, Barbieri once noted, you had to
wait for someone to die before you could get one, at which point you
fashioned your own mouthpiece so as not to blow through a dead man's
mouthpiece.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Barbieri first developed the distinctive sound and
timbre that continue to transfix audiences around the world.</TE>
<TE>   But that original saxophone was lost while Barbieri was touring in
Europe late last year, necessitating another Conn/Selmer merger. "I
destroy and I fix," Barbieri says of the process. "Now I have the
same sound I have so many years ago and I am so happy because I blow
much better. Same with the music--I destroy a little and then I fix
it in some way."</TE>
<TE>   Born Leandro, he picked up his nickname, El Gato (the Cat), early
on, and he's been the Cat with many hats from the start. Fifty years
after first making his mark in Buenos Aires playing with Lalo
Schifrin's big band, Barbieri embodies a constant transcendence of
borders and the cross-fertilization of musical genres.</TE>
<TE>   That process started in Schifrin's band, which in the early '50s
explored both big-band swing and bebop, which Barbieri was drawn to
after falling in love with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.</TE>
<TE>   But a directive from Argentina's dictator, Juan Peron, forced
Schifrin's band to devote half of its repertoire to traditional
music.</TE>
<TE>   "So I have to play tango, malambo, chacarera, carnavalito,"
Barbieri says. Yet when Barbieri and Michelle moved to Rome in the
early '60s, he fell headlong into the free jazz movement, playing
with Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of that decade, Barbieri had abandoned the avant-garde,
reconnecting to his roots and cultural heritage. He featured
folkloric melodies, rhythms and instruments on such groundbreaking
albums as "The Third World" and "Bolivia," as well as the four-part
"Chapter" series, which focused on different regions of Latin
America. All this predated the world music boom by a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't make salsa, which is a fruit salad," Barbieri says of the
vanguard fusion of jazz freedom, pop accessibility and folkloric
roots. His music, he adds, was "not a little Latin, a little jazz--it
was in between and this I did in 1969." An Argentine film director
had set the process in motion, telling Barbieri "You are Latin, you
have to pick up the things that belong to you and do it."</TE>
<TE>   And, according to Barbieri, his counselor added, "You have many
options to play folkloric music, but you have to change things. And
you have to do it naturally--it never is good when you copy, you have
to become natural at it." Which is how the coarse, wailing sound and
strident tone of bebop and beyond melded so comfortably with
folkloric idioms, including tango.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was Barbieri's sensuous soundtrack for Bernardo
Bertolucci's sexually provocative "Last Tango in Paris" that elevated
him to international stardom in 1972. He'd worked with Bertolucci and
another Italian director, Pier Pasolini, before writing and
performing the score for the controversial "Last Tango," which earned
Barbieri a Grammy for best instrumental composition.</TE>
<TE>   The '70s brought forth a series of softer pop-jazz albums, one of
which included Barbieri's bolero version of Santana's "Europa." When
smooth jazz stations started popping up in the late '80s, many of
them adopted "Europa" as their station theme. Barbieri's approach was
not unlike a car radio, punching up different stations of his career
depending on his mood, an approach he still favors.</TE>
<TE>   "I play the songs of my life," he explains. "Some tunes, they are
very sad, some are happy, some are sensual. It's incredible because
when I was looking to find songs, I have so many things I did and I
want to play all things. The only thing I have to play is 'Europa,'
because if I don't, people become mad. But it's a beautiful tune."</TE>
<TE>   Which is what Barbieri relishes after a long period of emotional
and physical adversity.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't record for 14 years because we are in bad shape with
Michelle," says Barbieri, who was so consumed with her illness that
he lost track of his own health. "We have tough time and I didn't
worry about me. But when Michelle was ill, I was ill already,
starting to have pains. She died and after one month I have my triple
bypass, and after that, nothing. I survive it to play, but it is
difficult to get up from Michelle's death. Myself, I was very down."</TE>
<TE>   Appropriately, it was music that speeded Barbieri's recovery and
he returned to recording and touring in 1997 with the acclaimed "Que
Pasa," and starred in Fernando Trueba's "Calle 54." That documentary
celebration of Latin jazz included the final appearances of two
legendary figures, Tito Puente and Chico O'Farill. But for many
people, Barbieri's presence also signaled that time and circumstance
had not diminished what jazz critic Nat Hentoff described as "the
life-affirming, surging spirit of his performances." Barbieri's
robust, ruggedly sensual "Lamerito &amp; Tango Bolivia" showed his
passion and stamina to be intact, his playing as virile as ever.</TE>

<HD>Aim Was True, but Albums Will Happen</HD>
<DH>Arts* Elvis Costello's UCLA residency is put on hold as he
makes a record. 'It's really nobody's fault,' the program director
says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Give the UCLA tenure of Elvis Costello as artist in residence a grade
of incomplete.</LD>
<LD>   After the English singer-songwriter was able to oversee only one
event--a concert tribute to jazz composer Charles Mingus in
September--the university's performing arts department has put
Costello's trumpeted residency on suspension.</LD>
<LD>   But the artist and the school have already scheduled a makeup
test--Costello will give a concert at the UCLA Ackerman Grand
Ballroom on May 28, two days before he plays the Kodak Theatre.
Tickets for the show--his first in a nonseated facility in more than
20 years--will go on sale Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Costello is also being given an extension on his duties, as it
were. "We're rescheduling further events of his residency for next
year," said UCLA director of performing arts David Sefton, who named
Costello the inaugural artist in residence last spring.</TE>
<TE>   What the postponed events will actually be is still to be
determined, Sefton says. A ballet based on Shakespeare's "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" with orchestral music composed by Costello for the
Italian dance company Aterballeto, originally planned for this
summer, is probably not going to happen at all because of scheduling
conflicts, though the music may be performed in another context.</TE>
<TE>   Costello's residency was part of an ambitious roll-out of new
programs overseen by Sefton, the former head of contemporary culture
for London's Royal Festival Hall who took the reins at UCLA in
October 2000. He also introduced the Los Angeles debut last month of
the three-day All Tomorrow's Parties--a festival concept imported
from England in which an artist serves as "curator"--and last year
brought in "The Harry Smith Project," producer Hal Willner's program
of music and film honoring the late folk archivist and avant-garde
figure.</TE>
<TE>   Costello, who has collaborated with artists ranging from Burt
Bacharach to the classical Brodsky Quartet and mezzo-soprano Anne
Sofie von Otter, seemed a perfect choice to bridge the worlds of pop
culture and academia. But work on "When I Was Cruel," his first new
rock album since 1994, and the fact that he lives in Dublin made the
implementation of plans more difficult than anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really nobody's fault, but the machinery of Elvis producing
a new record proved impossible to schedule around," Sefton said this
week. "It's not through any want of trying, but the record and things
being planned around it turned into such a big deal that by mutual
consent we had to agree on making [the artist-in-residence duties] a
back-burner thing.... At the start it was going to be four [events]
in the year, and perhaps he hadn't grasped how much time would be
taken up by the record."</TE>
<TE>   A representative for Costello said that the musician was working
in a London studio and was not available to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The problems, Sefton said, will be taken into consideration when
he chooses his second artist in residence.</TE>
<TE>   "There are names being thrown around," he said. "But scheduling is
very hard. The world of rock 'n' roll is driven by record sales and
promotion, and it's quite difficult to break out of that system. I
would be reluctant to give up ever working with someone from that
world again in this format, but you do learn. Elvis, by his position,
interest and talent, was definitely the right choice. But pity he
doesn't live here."</TE>
<TE>   The next artist in residence will almost certainly be based closer
to L.A., which will not only facilitate the production of formal
events but also allow for the possibility of some more casual
elements, such as student workshops. Sefton also said that the
curator for the next All Tomorrow's Parties--which he is close to
confirming but would not disclose--will be based closer to here than
the debut's Sonic Youth, which is from New York.</TE>
<TE>   Talks are also ongoing with a number of artists for special
events, including Velvet Underground co-founder John Cale, who is
discussing such ideas as a concert of his album "Paris 1919."</TE>
<TE>   "There are enough people doing straight rock gigs, and I don't
need to do those," Sefton said. "I want to do events. I want a
program that creates things like 'The Harry Smith Project' and the
Mingus concert. The Smith show was done three times and will never be
done again. Mingus was done just a few times, and if you weren't
there, then it's gone. I like that one-off quality. I love the word
'happening.' I want to rediscover that--the sense that you're at
something that's a big deal."</TE>

<HD>Rukeyser Taking Show to CNBC</HD>
<DH>Television* The financial broadcaster, fired by PBS, will
have a program on Friday nights that will have a very familiar
format.</DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Financial broadcaster Louis Rukeyser, after the much-publicized
brouhaha over his firing from the PBS fixture series "Wall Street
Week," will join cable channel CNBC, where his new Friday night show
will go head to head with the old program in many markets.</LD>
<LD>   "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street" will be seen at 5:30 and 8:30 p.m.
Pacific time starting April 19, featuring the same opening
commentary, all 22 of the previous rotating panelists and a guest.
"Anyone who liked the previous show will be very comfortable with
this one," Rukeyser said.</LD>
<LD>   Rukeyser, 69, was a financial TV pioneer with "Wall Street Week"
32 years ago. He was fired in March after using the show to protest
announced plans by PBS and producer Maryland Public Television to
modernize the format, bringing in Fortune magazine as a partner and
significantly diminishing Rukeyser's role.</LD>
<TE>   In an unusual move, CNBC will make reruns of the new show
available to public television stations beginning at 9 p.m. Fridays,
which means some of the 20% of the U.S. households without cable or a
satellite dish might still be able to see the program if it is picked
up by their local stations.</TE>
<TE>   CNBC will also initially run the program using public
broadcasting's underwriting format, with no ads in the body of the
show. The network hopes to line up underwriting messages that would
be seen in the CNBC and public TV telecasts.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Robert J. Shuman, chief executive of Maryland
Public Television, wished Rukeyser well, saying that MPT is "excited
about our refreshed and reinvigorated" show, which launches in June.</TE>
<TE>   Many public stations have been inundated with complaints about the
change. Asked how he thought the new show would fare, Rukeyser said,
"I'm willing to leave that to the viewing public," adding, "There's
been an extraordinary reaction coast to coast. I could die happy with
all the nice things happening."</TE>
<TE>   Terms of Rukeyser's arrangement with CNBC weren't disclosed,
although one person familiar with the deal said the NBC-owned channel
made an initial one-year commitment to Rukeyser, who will also appear
occasionally on other CNBC programs.</TE>

<HD>Filmmakers Seek Out the Smell of Success at Newport Beach
Fest</HD>
<DH>Festival* John Waters, along with the cast of 'Polyester,'
will attend the event featuring movies by emerging artists from 27
countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Independent filmmaker John Waters didn't coin the term "audience
participation," but he did make it a novelty at art houses with the
release of "Polyester" in 1981 and his then-latest invention: Odorama
cards.</LD>
<LD>   Those scratch-and-sniff placards will return when the Newport
Beach Film Festival screens "Polyester" at the Lido Theater on
Friday, where Waters, his cast and crew will make an appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Audiences can once more drop the popcorn and get a whiff of
everything from pizza to sweaty socks. In a recent telephone
interview from his home in Baltimore, the 56-year-old Waters recalled
what inspired his audacious, odiferous gimmick.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a film critic who hated my movies, and he said that if
people ever saw my name on a marquee, they should walk on the other
side of the street, because in his opinion, my movies stank so bad,"
Waters said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the criticism, he continued to produce what he loved
best--movies about the values and peculiarities of middle America,
often championing misfits, outcasts and underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of the Newport Beach Film Festival which begins
Thursday and continues through April 19, said Waters is a perfect
choice to represent the unconventional approaches of their
participants; most are experimental or indie filmmakers. Other
special guests will include composer Elmer Bernstein and film and
video music director McG.</TE>
<TE>   "We pride ourselves in being a filmmakers' festival. So we try to
pair emerging artists with established filmmakers of different
genres," said festival executive director Gregg Schwenk. "And we
celebrate film as an art form, as well as entertainment, so we want
to give equal time to those in front of the camera and behind it."</TE>
<TE>   The festival opens Thursday with the premiere of "The Bank,"
starring Anthony La Paglia at the Edwards Big Newport and includes
180 films--70 features and 110 shorts--that represent 27 countries.</TE>
<TE>   Latino, Filipino, Japanese, Italian, German and Irish filmmakers
are awaiting the world premieres of some unusual and offbeat movies.
"The Broken Wings of Elijah Footfalls" is an experimental silent film
about a lonely street juggler who discovers a vagabond circus troupe
in a wooded valley. "Mind Meld" is a documentary on "Star Trek's"
William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, while "Stan Lee" is a documentary
on the Marvel Comics cartoonist who created Spider-Man, Captain
America and the Incredible Hulk.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Rain Lifts" is a drama written by famed Japanese
director Akira Kurosawa. The story takes place in the Kyoho era
during a monsoon and centers on a husband, his wife and an unemployed
samurai who becomes obsessed with the wife's seeming unhappiness and
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity for filmgoers to see independent art
house films that aren't available at the megaplexes," said organizer
Billy Fried, a Baltimore native and longtime friend of Waters who
invited the director to the festival. "Orange County is the Baltimore
of California, and it's a perfect fertile ground for John's
imagination."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers hope Waters will be an inspiration to the 120
filmmakers attending the festival.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, what John and the festival represent is
any kind of new and original voice," Fried said.</TE>
<TE>   Waters said that even if a director's vision is completely out
there, he or she should stay true to his or her voice and try to find
an audience. "'Polyester' reached a lot more people because of the
Odorama cards, because they thought it was funny and it caught on,"
he said, recalling his disappointment that the Library of Smells
wouldn't allow him to reproduce the smell of glue on the original
cards. (Rotten eggs were OK, though.)</TE>
<TE>   The story of a forlorn housewife named Francine Fishpaw,
"Polyester" starred Divine and was the first and last feature
presented in Odorama.</TE>
<TE>   Each audience member was given a watermelon pink postcard marked
by 10 pink dots that coincided with 10 key scenes in the film.
On-screen flashing signals instructed viewers on which number to
scratch to unleash the smelly surprises. The stink cards followed the
movie's plot, and the odors got worse before the scent of fresh air
signaled a happy ending.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in a long time that the movie will be seen
in theaters in the way it was meant to be," said Schwenk, who worked
with New Line Home Entertainment to bring the cards back.</TE>
<TE>   The suburban smelodrama holds a dear place for Waters since it was
his first major distribution and pulled the obscure director from
midnight-movie screenings.</TE>
<TE>   "'Polyester' was the first movie that I made that was R-rated and
had a real Hollywood star, Tab Hunter, and Divine, who was my
Elizabeth Taylor," said Waters, the creator of "Pink Flamingos,"
"Hairspray," "Cry-Baby," "Serial Mom" and "Cecil B. Demented."</TE>
<TE>   But Waters has another reason for attending. He wants to encourage
the upstarts and help independent films get more exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was growing up, I used to have to drive around everywhere
to see good movies and go to film festivals that were mostly held on
college campuses as part of an academic series," Waters said. "With
local film festivals like Newport Beach, people don't have to leave
their communities."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Seeking New Stars: The Desperate Hours</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Television has a well-deserved reputation for discovering stars,
whether it's Bruce Willis' "Moonlighting" before he ever died hard in
a theater, Sally Field's recently grounded round-trip flight from TV
to big screen, or the various movie roles allotted to the
once-unknown casts, if that seems possible, of "Friends" and "ER."</LD>
<LD>   If recent headlines are any indication, however, television is
losing the battle to keep pace with this astronomical demand for
fresh talent--as evidenced, among other things, by MSNBC calling Phil
Donahue out of the wilderness to host a talk show and the
transformation of "Survivor" castaways into instant TV personalities.</LD>
<LD>   With so many hungry channels to feed, TV can't seem to fabricate
stars fast enough, explaining the willingness to reach into the past
as well as tendencies to provide celebrities the sort of vanity
vehicles normally reserved for small theaters and thrust anyone who
has achieved the smallest measure of fame into the spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   Cable channels are particularly prone to these impulses, in part
because they aren't as compelled to reach a mass audience as
broadcasters, freeing them to pursue more niche-oriented concepts.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue's name recognition, coupled with whatever goodwill he
engendered during all those years in national syndication, thus
offers MSNBC the hope that a fraction of that audience--all it will
take to be a success by the channel's less exacting standards--will
welcome the white-haired host back like an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   The term is used advisedly, since Donahue, at 66, is hardly a
poster child for the MTV or WB network crowd. Fortunately, news is
one of the few areas somewhat sheltered from the media world's
well-practiced ageism, a venue where many leading anchors are
eligible to collect Social Security and "60 Minutes" correspondent
Mike Wallace, 84, can talk about cutting back on his workload instead
of reminiscing about his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, virtually the rest of the entertainment landscape is
caught in a nonstop, demographically driven search for the fountain
of youth, to the point where having bug-eating or surviving immunity
challenges on your resume is more attractive than "MASH" or "All in
the Family."</TE>
<TE>   So it is that "Survivor's" Colleen Haskell landed a co-starring
part in the film "The Animal," while the program's first winner,
Richard Hatch, became a correspondent for "Entertainment Tonight."</TE>
<TE>   "Survivor: The Australian Outback's" Alicia Calloway, meanwhile,
has parlayed her physique, chiseled by her work as a personal
trainer, into a series of on-air roles--hosting "Antarctica: A Voyage
to the Final Frontier" for the Outdoor Life Network (yes, that's a
real channel on your digital cable tier somewhere) and being hired as
the health-and-fitness correspondent for WNYW, the local Fox station
in New York, beginning this month.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Chang, an agent at IMG, which represents the likes of Tiger
Woods and John Madden, was undaunted about taking Calloway on as a
client even though the clock on a "Survivor" contestant's media
viability begins ticking almost as soon as he or she gets voted off
the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was just saying you've got to capitalize on it very,
very quickly," said Chang. "But I had more of a long-term vision for
her."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, transplanting people who gain fame in one arena into TV
is hardly new, though one can argue the bar on who qualifies has been
lowered even from the day when athletes like Don Meredith and O.J.
Simpson proved that acting is harder than it looks.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, cable's appetite for low-cost original
programming has brought to life all sorts of oddities built around
more traditional celebrities, apparently inspired by the notion that
a half-hour of Bill Murray doing just about anything is good enough
to intrigue some viewers.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, you get "The Sweet Spot," a new Comedy Central series
that features Murray playing golf with his three brothers. The show
has a certain charm if you are, say, a junior in college under the
influence of six or seven beers, but its approach is so offbeat as to
make you wonder if the Murrays could have pitched anything that the
channel wouldn't have bought.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Comedy Central General Manager Bill Hilary said that's the
point--that the last thing TV needs is another conventional sitcom
built around a marquee film actor, though he was too polite to
mention since-departed vehicles for Geena Davis, Bette Midler and
others to make his case.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to have a big star, like Bill Murray, we want to
do something that no one else would do," Hilary said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours is a harsh, discerning audience. That 24-to-34-year-old
audience doesn't wait around. You can arrest them for 30 seconds, but
you can't keep them. ... If they don't have it their way, they won't
be back again."</TE>
<TE>   Showcasing celebrities in unconventional settings is theoretically
a way to get that younger audience's attention, at least for a while.
So MTV gives us Ozzy Osbourne as a mumbling real-life sitcom dad;
singer Chris Isaak plays a version of himself in his eponymous
Showtime comedy; and "Seinfeld" co-creator Larry David does the same
in HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm"--notably, a modest success for the
pay channel despite drawing a much smaller audience than the sitcoms
crafted for "Seinfeld" co-stars Michael Richard, Jason Alexander and
Julia Louis-Dreyfus.</TE>
<TE>   That said, even the major networks aren't immune to cable-like
flights of fancy. NBC's foraging for a star with built-in appeal
propelled chef Emeril Lagasse from the Food Network's kitchen into a
sitcom, where he demonstrated that it is indeed possible to have a
tough time playing yourself.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, meanwhile, with its tentative plans for another "Celebrity
Boxing" special, continues to prove that any measure of fame or
notoriety has value--especially if the possessor is willing to be
pummeled about the head, either figuratively or literally, in
exchange for a few more minutes in front of a camera.</TE>
<TE>   No one has suggested yet that Donahue strap on the gloves to
promote his MSNBC series, which makes its debut this summer; still,
given the desperation already on display, the idea sounds less like
satire or science fiction than it once might have, as programmers
scan the night sky for ways to arrest an audience, hopefully without
resorting to tactics that will get themselves arrested in the
process.</TE>

<HD>Can Fiction Solve a Real Mystery?</HD>
<DH>Movies* How and why did Thomas Ince die on Hearst's yacht?
'The Cat's Meow' adds another theory to the sex- and
champagne-drenched saga.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN MAYNARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"History has been written in whispers. This is the whisper told most
often. The yacht, you see, belonged to William Randolph Hearst."</LD>
<LD>   So begins Victorian romance novelist Elinor Glyn (played by Joanna
Lumley) in "The Cat's Meow," a new film about a weekend of murder and
mayhem in the Roaring '20s in which history and fiction collide.</LD>
<LD>   It's the latest in a line of films that includes "Ragtime," "The
Cradle Will Rock" and even "Gosford Park," mingling fictional and
nonfictional characters in a cultural context. Although such films
often inspire renewed speculation about real events and people, they
also can spark controversy, as was the case with "A Beautiful Mind."</LD>
<TE>   "Cat's Meow" writer Steven Peros learned the story that inspired
his screenplay in 1988, when his New York University film school
professor, film historian William K. Everson, told the tale
matter-of-factly to his class.</TE>
<TE>   "We were watching a silent short starring William S. Hart and
produced by Thomas Ince," says Peros. "And Everson said, 'Of course,
you know how Ince died, don't you?' And a class of 18-year-olds said,
'Well, no, not really.'" Everson proceeded to tell them the story of
Ince's mysterious death in 1924 aboard the Oneida, a yacht belonging
to Hearst, a newspaper mogul.</TE>
<TE>   According to Hearst's newspapers, Ince, a pioneer of silent films
who was celebrating his 43rd birthday on board, died of a heart
attack. Elsewhere, the reported cause was acute indigestion. That his
corpse was cremated further muddied the waters, resulting in an urban
legend that Ince was murdered.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest rumors was that the Los Angeles Times, one of
Hearst's competitors, published the headline "Movie Producer Shot on
Hearst Yacht" in an early edition but that it was killed in later
editions because of threats from Hearst.</TE>
<TE>   A search of Times archives turned up two stories that said Ince
died the following Wednesday at his home, surrounded by family
members; they cited "heart disease, superinduced by the indigestion
attack," which the later story said occurred two days earlier aboard
the yacht.</TE>
<TE>   For Peros, the story had instant appeal. Hearst had been
immortalized already in Orson Welles' fictional celluloid masterpiece
"Citizen Kane," but here was a tantalizing footnote.</TE>
<TE>   "So I held onto the story," says Peros. "And about a year out of
college, I started researching the people that were supposedly on the
yacht."</TE>
<TE>   If it wasn't already apparent this was "Hollywood Babylon"
material, consider the passenger list Peros gleaned from varying
accounts. Among those aboard for the weekend boat trip from San Pedro
to San Diego were fledgling gossip columnist Louella Parsons (played
by Jennifer Tilly); Hearst's lover, actress Marion Davies (Kirsten
Dunst); and Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), rumored to also be having
an affair with Davies.</TE>
<TE>   More than murder is afoot in "The Cat's Meow." It's also about
movers and shakers, desperate people looking for a piece of the
Hollywood dream. A financially destitute Ince (Cary Elwes) attempts
to forge a partnership with Hearst's Cosmopolitan Pictures, while
Parsons schemes to leave her film critic job at Hearst's New York
offices for a post on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Such behind-the-scenes machinations form fascinating mosaics of
early 20th century American society and its tenuous relationship to
the arts.</TE>
<TE>   "To varying degrees, seeking patronage is a definition of art,"
says Peros, who knows whereof he speaks, having struggled for a
decade in development hell to get his script onto the big screen.
"Artists need to eat to survive; they need money for their art. This
is a film about the games played between the artist and the patron
without passing judgment on either."</TE>
<TE>   "The Cat's Meow" is also about the high price of achieving fame
and fortune, a subject its director, Peter Bogdanovich, knows all too
intimately. Thirty-two years ago, Bogdanovich first heard of the
story of the Oneida from Welles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great story I always wanted to tell," says Bogdanovich.
"It's about famous people who have this mythic level.... Money,
power, fame and success are things blown up to be such a big deal.
And as one who's had it and lost it, I know that firsthand"</TE>
<TE>   Bogdanovich's own public image overshadowed his career. Even
though he directed '70s cinema greats that included "Targets," "The
Last Picture Show" and "Paper Moon," the media paid more attention to
his love affairs with leading lady Cybill Shepherd and, later,
Playboy playmate Dorothy Stratten, who was shot dead by her estranged
husband.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been used as a character on at least three occasions that I
know of, and in no case was there any care taken to try and make it
remotely like me," says Bogdanovich.</TE>
<TE>   "That said, Steven and I, and then the actors, spent an enormous
amount of labor to try to be as close to what we felt the truth was
as we could. Maybe it isn't absolutely what happened, but it seems
pretty close based on all the different reports and different
disguised reports over the years. It is, I think, a fair
speculation."</TE>
<TE>   The life and times of William Randolph Hearst have been
inextricably linked in the public mind to Welles' Charles Foster
Kane.</TE>
<TE>   But although Hearst and Kane share some similar
characteristics--both were big businessmen with egos to match their
empires--there are huge disparities between the man and his mythic
alter ego.</TE>
<TE>   "'Kane' has always been one of my favorite films and Welles one of
my favorite filmmakers," says Peros. "But as I researched Hearst, I
started to get really intrigued by their differences. Certainly the
biggest difference was between [Kane's mistress] Susan Alexander and
Marion Davies."</TE>
<TE>   By Welles' own admission, "Citizen Kane's" biggest misstep was in
making Alexander a no-talent gold digger while Davies was praised by
critics and audiences as a lively and charming silent-movie star and
comedian.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cat's Meow" portrays Hearst and Davies as they truly were, a
couple who stayed together out of mutual love and respect despite
their 35-year age difference and his marriage to another woman.</TE>
<TE>   For Edward Herrmann, an actor who's played a variety of real-life
greats from Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Lou Gehrig to Nelson
Rockefeller, it was a chance to get that relationship right.</TE>
<TE>   "This film shows Hearst as very human and vulnerable," he says.
"That's what she loved about him." His portrayal of Hearst is that of
a middle-aged, socially awkward, gentle giant, a far cry from the
macho, swaggering tycoon that a 24-year-old Welles had conjured.</TE>
<TE>   But though the film may get the details of their relationship
right, the ill-fated weekend aboard the Oneida is pure conjecture.</TE>
<TE>   For historian David Nasaw, author of "The Chief: The Life of
William Randolph Hearst," this kind of playing fast and loose with
the facts is infuriating. Though Nasaw hasn't seen the film, it
doesn't hold any interest for him.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes my skin crawl," he says. "It's not blending fact and
fiction; it's saying things they know to be untrue. You can't libel
the dead, but you can libel history. We work so damn hard to teach
students the difference between history and myth. And Hollywood
forgets it all. And we end up battling images; film carries with it
the presumption of reality. I think that's why a lot of people got
upset over 'A Beautiful Mind.' It carries with it the notion that
this is what happened."</TE>
<TE>   In Nasaw's book, the Oneida scandal is blamed on rumors spread by
one of Hearst's executives at Cosmopolitan magazine, Dr. Daniel
Carson Goodman, who was on the yacht. Nasaw contends that Hearst
covered up that Ince was on the yacht not to hide his murder but to
stop the press and police from investigating the illegal consumption
of champagne (this was during Prohibition) and because Ince had
brought his alleged mistress with him.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there's much debate even among historians. In "Tramp," a
biography of Chaplin, author Joyce Milton describes several
inconsistencies among accounts of Ince's death. She suggests that it
is plausible a shooting occurred and even surmises it may have been
Chaplin who pulled the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   By his own account, Chaplin was "almost suicidal" about his
impending shotgun wedding to 16-year-old Lita Grey. Lore has it that
he could have accidentally killed Ince while playing with a
.38-caliber revolver, the bullet passing through a plywood partition
into Ince's cabin.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of hearsay is key to understanding the early days of
Hollywood, according to film historian Richard Schickel, author of
biographies of early cinema legends D.W. Griffith and Douglas
Fairbanks.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to get in more trouble doing a movie about John Nash
than doing William Randolph Hearst," he says. "I read and reviewed
Nasaw's biography of Hearst, and it would have been entirely out of
Hearst's character to do anything violent. But I think the important
thing about Hollywood history is that it's very much an oral history.
It's not a written-down history.</TE>
<TE>   "The documentation that would satisfy a historian of say, the
Civil War, simply isn't present. It was such a fly-by-night operation
in those days that people will concede, 'who can really know what
happened?' Besides, there's something about real frogs in imaginary
gardens that's kind of mythic and entertaining."</TE>
<TE>   It's the mythmakers involved who have kept the story of the Oneida
alive for 78 years. In 1981, Patte Barham, daughter of
Hearst-employed publisher Frank Barham, did her own investigation in
Los Angeles Magazine, despite her father's stern disapproval. In
1996, Patricia Hearst wrote her novel "Murder at San Simeon,"
retelling the story of Ince's death aboard her grandfather's yacht.
Two of Ince's cousins appeared on an "E! Mysteries and Scandals"
episode about the incident, supporting the foul play theory, although
Ince's granddaughter, Nancy Ince Probert, vehemently denies it.</TE>
<TE>   Peros hopes the continuing controversy will entice curious
audiences to "The Cat's Meow" the same way the legend attracted him.
"To me, it was just a story that was always going to cause a lot of
debate," says Peros. "There's no smoking gun, just the smell of smoke
in every room."</TE>

<LD>   HBO Picks Up Film About Bush Campaign</LD>
<LD>   "Journeys With George," Alexandra Pelosi's movie of her yearlong
road trip on the campaign trail with George W. Bush, will be seen on
HBO this year after screenings at a number of film festivals. A
specific date has not yet been set.</LD>
<TE>   The 76-minute film, in which the Republican candidate is shown
clowning with reporters and guzzling nonalcoholic beer, has generated
concern among Bush advisers that the footage might undermine the
strong, no-nonsense image of the president during a time of national
crisis. Still, most of them opted not to speak out against the film
for fear it would fuel public interest.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi, the daughter of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), minority
whip of the House, insists that the movie is not a hatchet job but an
inside look into the political system and what HBO calls "W
unplugged--an all-access pass to the closest and most controversial
presidential election in history."</TE>
<TE>   When covering the campaign for NBC, Pelosi's initial goal was to
create a video diary--with or without Bush's participation. Distant
at first, the future president warmed up and allowed filming of
informal moments.</TE>
<TE>   "What it reveals is how we elect our presidents, and George Bush
is just one of the many great characters on the road trip," she says.
"I certainly would not have been able to pull this off if I were
covering Al Gore."</TE>

<TE>   Security Tight on Fox's '24' Season Finale</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth Century Fox Television and Imagine Entertainment are
taking precautions to ensure no one leaks specifics about the May 21
finale of their critically acclaimed series "24," due to start
shooting April 18.</TE>
<TE>   Variety reports that everyone on the production team will have to
sign a confidentiality agreement, vowing that they won't
"disseminate, permit access to, duplicate, display, publish, state or
in any other manner disclose" information about the production. Those
violating the contract can be sued by the studio for damages.</TE>
<TE>   To tighten the screws, all copies of the final script will be
numbered and printed on red paper that is virtually impossible to
copy. The set will be closed to anyone deemed nonessential.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the ending of 'The Sixth Sense,'" said Joel Surnow,
executive producer of the series about efforts over the course of a
single day to foil a political assassination. "You don't want to blow
it for fans."</TE>

<TE>   MTV Revisits Scene of Los Angeles Riots</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, in the wake of the riots over the Rodney King
verdict, MTV turned its cameras on the center of the disturbance in
South-Central Los Angeles, showing a news report called "Straight
From the Hood."</TE>
<TE>   And now, it's going back--examining what progress, if any, has
been made in the neighborhood. "Back to the Hood," a one-hour
documentary that can be seen April 24, will feature interviews with
Snoop Dogg, telling why he and his friends left Long Beach to join
the chaos; R&amp;B singer Tyrese, who admits to looting stores; and rap
artist Jurassic Five, who lived a block from the intersection of
Florence and Normandie and witnessed the beating of truck driver
Reginald Denny.</TE>
<TE>   The special also zooms in on twentysomethings throughout
South-Central, Crenshaw, Watts and Koreatown, who share their
memories of the riots.</TE>

<TE>   Allen's Cannes Visit: A Snub to Venice?</TE>
<TE>   Woody Allen is famous for avoiding film festivals and awards
shows. But, fresh on the heels of his surprise Oscar appearance, he's
announced that he'll introduce his new film, "Hollywood Ending," at
the opening of the Cannes Film Festival in May. It's his first visit
to the Croisette, say organizers of the event, which screened Allen's
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" in 1985 and "Hannah and Her Sisters" the
following year.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood Ending," in which the director stars with Tea Leoni,
Mark Rydell and Treat Williams, will be presented in Cannes' Out of
Competition category. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the
announcement didn't sit well in Italy, whose Venice International
Film Festival premiered Allen's previous eight films. Still, if
Moritz de Hadeln, the Venice festival's newly appointed director, was
disappointed, he took the high road.</TE>
<TE>   "This choice in no way penalizes Venice," he said. "Allen will be
back another time. The doors are always open for him."</TE>
<TE>   A different note was sounded by Italy's culture undersecretary,
who is engaged in a power struggle with the management of the
foundation overseeing the film festival. "I hope other people follow
Woody Allen's example, and that Venice is a failure," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   CBS is canceling its reality-documentary series "AFP: American
Fighter Pilot" after two episodes. Reruns of "JAG," "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" and specials will be aired in its Friday 8 p.m.
slot.... It's the end of the road for "The Court," the Supreme Court
drama starring Sally Field that premiered March 26. ABC is pulling
the plug, bringing back "Philly" at 10 p.m. on Tuesdays.... According
to the Hollywood Reporter, Kevin Costner will be directing his first
film in nearly five years, taking the reins of the western "Open
Range," in which he's set to co-star with Robert Duvall.... The
fourth annual Method Fest Independent Film Festival, honoring
breakout acting performances in independent film, will give a
lifetime achievement award to Rod Steiger on April 19. The festival,
running April 12-19, will screen more than 50 feature and short
films.... Former "X-Files" star David Duchovny will play crime
novelist James Ellroy in a film adaptation of the author's memoir,
"My Dark Places." The story of the unsolved 1958 murder of Ellroy's
mother will be directed by Robert Greenwald ("Steal This Movie").</TE>

<HD>Hooray for Bollywood</HD>
<DH>India's film industry, in its answer to the Oscars, airs a
$3-million awards show from Malaysia, seen in 134 countries, complete
with dances and long speeches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT PITZER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>At the extravagant film awards ceremony, a dazzling actress draped in
sparkling rocks descended to the stage on a trapeze, to sing about
diamonds being a girl's best friend, in tribute to Nicole Kidman in
"Moulin Rouge." The audience included A-list celebrities and millions
of TV viewers in many countries.</LD>
<LD>   If it seems familiar, it should. Putting on its own version of the
Oscars, the Indian film industry, widely known as Bollywood, last
weekend feted its glitterati with Hollywood-style pomp and glamour.
The dazzling, $3-million production included over-the-top dance
numbers and, much like the recent Academy Awards, too many dull
acceptance speeches.</LD>
<LD>   Arriving celebs stepped out of limousines onto a red carpet, as
thousands of cheering fans, held back by 300 police in riot helmets,
strained for a better view. Journalists from around Asia murmured
about the best and worst expressions of Indian fashion. The unlikely
venue: a Las Vegas-style mega-resort here in the middle of the
Malaysian jungle.</LD>
<TE>   By far the world's most prolific film industry, producing more
than 800 movies a year, Bollywood has been slow to mount a major
awards show with international appeal. The International Indian Film
Academy Awards are only in their third year. But as it seeks to
emulate and compete with Hollywood, as well as reach out to millions
of fans throughout Asia, the Middle East and in Hindi-speaking
communities throughout the world, Indian cinema has pulled out all
the stops.</TE>
<TE>   The awards have been held in a different foreign locale each year,
to promote Indian film to a more international audience. The first
three have been held in areas with large Indian populations: Britain
in 2000, South Africa last year and this year Malaysia, where 10% of
the population is Indian. "Indian cinema is finally opening up to the
rest of the world, and gaining more recognition abroad," said Amitabh
Bachchan, who at 62 is both the grand old man of Indian film and
still a heartthrob to millions of Hindi-speaking fans. "Our films
have finally reached a status level where it makes sense to have
awards with an Oscars-type appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, "Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India," nominated
for a best foreign-language film at this year's Oscars, swept the
Indian Academy Awards. Other honored films included a family-values
drama, a love story and a nationalistic costume picture. True to
Indian form, the plots revolve around extravagant, lip-synched
song-and-dance routines. So along with categories for best picture,
actors and director, awards were given for best choreography, best
lyrics and best male and female playback singer.</TE>
<TE>   The award, a golden stylized statue of a sun, has about the
dimensions as an Oscar. But differences abound between the Hollywood
and Bollywood versions of events.</TE>
<TE>   When during the show, actress and former Miss Universe Sushmita
Sen segued from performing "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" into
"Material Girl," it was a specially recorded version of the Madonna
song using Indian instruments. The Indian Academy Awards included an
on-stage Indian mahurat, when filmmakers shot the ritual breaking of
a coconut to begin an enterprise, as the first frames of a movie
called "Plan," which goes into production this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stars spent several days before the awards ceremony at
the 12,000-capacity Genting Highlands resort, where the awards were
held. They attended a movie premiere and exclusive parties during the
days and evenings, lending the event the feel of a celebrity summer
camp. Despite the remoteness of the venue, thousands of fans traveled
from around Malaysia to stake out the hotels where the stars stayed.</TE>
<TE>   "To think that the biggest stars are here in our country, it's a
dream come true!" gushed Nur Hanisah Isa, 17, who came with 11
friends from Kuala Lumpur. "If I go home with one autograph or
picture, I'll be happy."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stars were generous with their attention, stopping on
the red carpet to shake hands with fans cheering with the abandon of
young girls at a Beatles concert. The awards, shown in 134 countries,
were watched by an estimated 20 million people, according to event
organizer Sabbas Joseph.</TE>
<TE>   They come at a time when Indian films are receiving a wider world
audience and increasing interest from Hollywood studios interested in
distribution deals. More than a dozen Hindi films were released
internationally with English subtitles last year, compared with two
or three films several years ago, said Joseph.</TE>

<KH>PULITZER ARTS WINNERS</KH>
<HD>Will Her Works Play at Home?</HD>
<DH>L.A. audiences may not know the plays of Suzan-Lori Parks,
but she lives in Venice and has ties to CalArts and Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suzan-Lori Parks is very much the top dog of Southern California
playwrights at the moment, even though her work has hardly been seen
in the Southland.</LD>
<LD>   Parks, 38, who lives in Venice, won the Pulitzer Prize on Monday
for "Topdog/Underdog," a day after the play opened on Broadway to
positive reviews. Her Pulitzer triumph followed an announcement last
fall that she won one of the annual $500,000 fellowships from the
MacArthur Foundation, commonly referred to as "genius" grants.</LD>
<LD>   Yet her only play to receive a professional production in L.A. was
an early work, "Imperceptible Mutabilities in the Third Kingdom,"
staged at the 99-seat Odyssey Theatre in West L.A. in 1993.</LD>
<TE>   "I've only lived [in Venice] about a year and a half. I haven't
had time to call myself a California writer. I'm not a New York
writer either. I'm just a writer," Parks said. "I wouldn't claim to
know California very well at all. I just write."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, her L.A. ties are several: Parks heads the Writing
for Performance Program at CalArts in Valencia, funded by A.S.K.
Theater Projects, and she is working on a film script and on a script
for a new stage musical, "Hoopz," about the Harlem Globetrotters,
being developed by Disney Theatricals.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Solt, dean of theater at CalArts, explained Tuesday how
Parks became associated with the school. "One of the missing
components of our program when I arrived seven years ago was
playwriting." Solt resolved to bring a professional playwright to
CalArts.</TE>
<TE>   Fran Bennett, head of the school's performance program, introduced
Solt to the work of Parks, who was then living in New York. Solt soon
decided that Parks "was the one playwright who could be emblematic of
our mission."</TE>
<TE>   Independently, Parks had been named a recipient of a 1996 Alpert
Award, a $50,000 prize for mid-career artists that brings the winners
to the CalArts campus for a week. "We made an aggressive approach to
her" that week, Solt recalled.</TE>
<TE>   It finally bore fruit four years later in a meeting at a New York
cafe near the theater where Parks' "In the Blood" was being
presented. "We told her we wanted her to create a new approach to
teaching writing. She believes in empowering the playwright. With
her, we knew we'd get someone who didn't want to make every student
writer a clone of herself."</TE>
<TE>   Parks was attracted by the possibility of having access to
Hollywood work without detaching herself from her playwriting, Solt
said. Parks wrote the Spike Lee film "Girl 6" and is adapting Toni
Morrison's novel "Paradise" for Oprah Winfrey's film production
company.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, one of the biggest Hollywood powers--Disney--hired
Parks about 18 months ago to work on "Hoopz," which had been under
development with another writer, Reggie Gaines, whom Parks replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Oken, Disney Theatrical executive vice president, brought
Parks into the project, which will feature music by Jeanine Tesori
and will be staged by Marion McClinton. Disney's plan is to produce a
workshop of "Hoopz" in New York next year, followed by a premiere at
Trinity Repertory company in Providence, R.I., in the 2003-2004
season. Trinity's artistic director is Oskar Eustis, former associate
artistic director of L.A.'s Mark Taper Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Taper dramaturge John Glore commented on the lack of
Parks productions in L.A. and specifically at the Taper: "It's silly
that we're so close, and we haven't been able to hook up with her
yet." However, he said that Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson
likes Parks' work and speculated that a Parks play might be a good
candidate for the Taper's new Culver City space, now called the Kirk
Douglas Theatre, when it opens in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. producer Susan Dietz, who runs Canon Theatrical out of the
Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills and is a co-producer of
"Topdog/Underdog," said Tuesday that she hopes the play will appear
at a nonprofit theater in L.A. such as the Taper, the Geffen
Playhouse, Pasadena Playhouse or at South Coast Repertory in Costa
Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   But "we have to watch what kind of audience it's attracting on
Broadway first," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Parks' works haven't even been presented in
student productions at CalArts. The playwright wants to be directly
involved in any CalArts production of her work, Solt said, but it has
been difficult to schedule such a production around the playwright's
own busy schedule.</TE>

<HD>Anime Series Draws on a World of Alienation</HD>
<DH>Strong characters and unusual heroes add dimension and
humanity to the controversial 'Shinseiki Evangelion.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES SOLOMON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since its debut in 1995, Hideaki Anno's "Shinseiki Evangelion" (Neon
Genesis Evangelion) has remained one of the most popular, influential
and controversial series in the history of Japanese animation.</LD>
<LD>   The television series and subsequent features have earned more
than $800 million in video sales and an additional $400 million in
sales of related merchandise. More than 800 Web sites in 12 languages
are devoted to "Evangelion" and, on a typical day, EBay may offer
1,000 related items.</LD>
<LD>   The eight-disc "Perfect Collection" (A.D. Vision, $170) presents
the entire 26-episode series in a noteworthy English dub.</LD>
<TE>   "Evangelion" (pronounced ee-van-GEL-ion, with a hard "G") is
derived from the German evangelium, which refers to the Christian
Gospels but is also slang for absolute truth. Anno's watershed series
was not the first anime series to combine giant robots with
apocalyptic Christian symbols and elements of Jungian psychology, but
it did so with exceptional panache. It's an intriguing and
sophisticated work, utterly unlike any American animated film.</TE>
<TE>   The story unfolds in 2015, 15 years after the Second Impact, a
cataclysmic explosion in Antarctica that devastated much of the
Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Although reported as a meteor strike, the explosion was caused by
a human encounter with Adam, the first of the powerful, sentient
creatures known as Angels to appear on Earth. The Angels are now
attacking the planet, and the defense of Earth rests with the secret
U.N. agency NERV. The only effective weapon against the Angels are
the Evas (short for "Evangelions"), NERV's enormous cyborg
robot-suits piloted by psychic teenagers. The most effective pilot is
14-year-old Shinji Ikari (voice by Spike Spencer, in an exceptional
performance), the alienated son of icy NERV Commander Gendo Ikari
(Tristan MacAvery).</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the brawling hunks in "Dragon Ball Z" or the grimly
dedicated warriors in "Gundam Wing," Shinji is a repressed and
reluctant hero. While he attempts to resolve the conflicted
relationship with his remote father, he befriends another pilot, Rei
Ayanami (Amanda Winn), and is essentially adopted by NERV officer
Misato Katsuragi (Allison Keith), who conceals deep emotional wounds
beneath a bubbly exterior.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the debut of "Evangelion," Anno wrote in the
magazine "Anime FX" that his lead characters "are both afraid of
being hurt. They might both be thought of as being unsuited to be
heroes, lacking the strength of self that marks such a person. And
yet I made them the heroes." But those weaknesses give them a depth
and humanity many anime characters lack.</TE>
<TE>   "Evangelion" includes some terrific action sequences: In one
episode, Shinji and another pilot defeat a humanoid Angel by
synchronizing their Evas in a combination of gymnastics and karate
movements. But the focus of the series remains the characters'
alienation and disillusionment. Shinji's victories don't bring him
the happiness and satisfaction heroes normally achieve: Overcome by
the strain of fighting the Angels and the revelations of his
commanders' duplicity, his ego implodes. The series ends in a long
collage of flashbacks and still artwork, accompanied by a protracted
internal dialogue between Shinji and the other characters as he
conceives them.</TE>
<TE>   These profoundly unsettling episodes suggest animated
schizophrenia and recall the chilling conclusion of Yukio Mishima's
"Sea of Fertility" tetralogy, in which the main character realizes he
can no longer be certain of his own existence. Both works offer a
desolate vision of a universe in which no answers exist--in this life
or any other.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as soon as they were broadcast, the final episodes of
"Evangelion" became the subject of heated discussions that show no
signs of abating. Some viewers hailed them as profound; detractors
replied that their meaning was more apparent than real. Anno wrote
that he created "Evangelion" after four years of severe depression
when he was "a wreck, unable to do anything," adding that "the story
has not yet ended in my mind. I don't know what will become of Shinji
or Misato, or where they will go."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the story was reworked in the theatrical feature "Death
and Rebirth" (1997); the second film, "End of Evangelion" (1997),
offered a new and more violent finale.</TE>
<TE>   Manga Entertainment will release "Death and Rebirth" on DVD on
June 25, with "End of Evangelion" to follow Sept. 24, enabling
American viewers to decide which ending they feel is the appropriate
one--which will probably lead to the creation of more Web sites and
further debate and discussion.</TE>

<HD>Hairy Happenings at 'Wolf Lake'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>"Wolf Lake" is a creature that won't die, not quietly anyway.</LD>
<LD>   The quirky werewolf tale, which underwent a metamorphosis at the
hands of CBS before its brief run last fall, has resurfaced on UPN,
which airs the first of six new episodes at 9 tonight (along with a
quick recap of the earlier shows). Officially, the latest
cross-channel maneuver by Viacom, parent of both networks, provides
prime-time filler for the next few weeks. But if "Wolf Lake" scares
up enough viewers, it could be picked up for a longer run.</LD>
<LD>   This rain-soaked mystery has yet to match the bleak wit or eerie
allure of "Twin Peaks," but it has a charm of its own, thanks to an
unusual premise and a strong cast.</LD>
<TE>   Lou Diamond Phillips plays Seattle cop John Kanin, whose search
for his then-missing girlfriend, Ruby Cates (Mia Kirshner), led him
to a remote hamlet where a clan morphs between wolf and human form. A
power struggle among these so-called shape-shifters resulted in
several unsolved slayings.</TE>
<TE>   Things get hairier tonight when the local sheriff, Matt Donner
(Tim Matheson), investigates the death of Ruby's bigwig dad, Will
Cates. Suspects include brash entrepreneur Tyler Creed (Scott
Bairstow), who wants to become leader of the shape-shifting pack, and
the coy widow Vivian Cates (Sharon Lawrence). But half the fun of a
show like this is that everyone seems a tad devious, including
Donner's sullen daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and her mystical
biology teacher (Graham Greene).</TE>
<TE>   When Donner is ambushed and shot, Kanin steps in to investigate.
Meanwhile, Ruby, hoping to quell the feud that claimed her father's
life, weds Creed in a devilish pact.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, there still is no crime in Seattle for Kanin to worry
about, which is one of many leaps in logic "Wolf Lake" requires. Yet
it avoids the worst crime in prime time: dullness.</TE>

<LD>It was another photo finish for CBS and NBC in the ratings race last
week, with an assist from the NCAA basketball tournament helping the
former score its second consecutive weekly win, based on viewing
estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC's "ER" topped the standings for the first time since December
and only the sixth time since the TV season began in September. The
network also received a boost Sunday by repeating "50 Years of NBC
Late Night"--which drew a significantly bigger audience than its
initial telecast on Sept. 23--while CBS belted out solid ratings with
its Celine Dion special.</LD>
<LD>   Midseason replacement series, meanwhile, for the most part
continue to struggle. In fact, three had their runs brought to a
premature end based on last week's results, with Fox pulling "The
American Embassy" and ABC cutting back on its plans for "Wednesday
9:30 (8:30 Central)" and the Sally Field drama "The Court."</LD>
<TE>   ABC's "The Bachelor" has shown some promise, but the network
remains a distant third, with "The Practice" as its only show to
crack the top 20 last week.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing of the NCAA basketball championship game essentially
mirrored results from a year ago. CBS research also estimates that
nearly 137 million people watched at least a few minutes of its
coverage over the tournament's three weeks.</TE>

<DH>Do good things come to those who wait? Ask composer Henry
Brant, 88, who won a prize this week and hopes it will lead to
greater opportunity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>"In my head, I understand it all right, but the rest of me has just
got the shakes."</LD>
<LD>   Henry Brant is standing in his frontyard late Monday afternoon.
The 88-year-old composer, dressed, as usual, in color-coordinated
sweats and a visor, has spent the day digesting this news: After
years of laboring in the shadows of contemporary music, his most
recently premiered commission, "Ice Field," won the 2002 Pulitzer
Prize for music.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Kathy Wilkowski, standing next to him, shakes her head.
"We've gotten more phone calls today than we have all year," she
says.</LD>
<TE>   And the phone keeps ringing as Brant and Wilkowski move inside the
house, which is also Brant's studio. His primary response to the
Pulitzer is simple: Maybe it will be a portal to an easier creative
future.</TE>
<TE>   "It was given to a piece that is by no means an easygoing,
conventional piece, " he says, "I regard it as an encouragement to
keep going the way that I go."</TE>
<TE>   Brant's "way" is what he calls "spatial music": works designed to
be performed by musicians scattered around a concert hall, rather
than just on stage. "Ice Field," premiered by Michael Tilson Thomas
and the San Francisco Symphony in December, put some players on stage
but also distributed them in various balconies and around seating
areas. Brant himself sat at the hall's pipe organ, playing a few
improvisational passages at key moments in the 20-minute work.</TE>
<TE>   Categorically immersive, "Ice Field" weaves together jazz,
dissonant Modernism, comical sound effects and even lovely melodies.
With sound coming from all directions, the listener is inside the
music, in a way that is utterly different from the way concert hall
music usually sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Amirkhanian, director of San Francisco's Other Minds
festival, which commissioned "Ice Field," says Pulitzer recognition
was far overdue for "the experimental wing of American music. I sat
next to one of the jurors Monday night at a concert, and he said,
'When you listen to the recording with the score in front of you, it
just pops out as one of the most brilliant and entertaining and wacky
inventions.'"</TE>
<TE>   "You get something with space music that isn't attainable any
other way," Brant has said. For one thing, dispersing musicians
allows his eclecticism freer rein: Complex music that might be too
dense coming from the focused source of a stage opens up when it's
spread around the hall.</TE>
<TE>   It's curious, Brant says, that "nobody" else is interested in it.
"I have the comfort of knowing that I have no rivals."</TE>
<TE>   From Brant's perspective, this is just the way music ought to be.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a big thing," he says, "because music cannot exist without
space. It's a whole big subject of where the sound goes, and that it
[usually is] artificially constrained is one of the surprises of the
last 50 years."</TE>
<TE>   Expectedly, Brant has had his champions, detractors and those who
straddle the fence, intrigued if not entirely convinced of his
vision. The New York Times review of "Ice Field" said that the work
"lies somewhere between precision planning and controlled chaos, a
mixture of smart bombs and dumb ones."</TE>
<TE>   Brant was born in Montreal in 1913, and he lived on the East Coast
for most of his life, teaching at Juilliard, Columbia and Bennington
College from 1957 to 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Besides teaching, he has also played jazz, wrote radio music and
worked as an orchestrator-composer for film. All of it shows up in
his serious music, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had advantages which few composers have had in the 20th
century, because of the commercial work I've done. In films, all they
said was 'our budget is such. You can have this much for music.' They
don't tell you what the instruments are to be or what they shouldn't
be."</TE>
<TE>   He left teaching and his other pursuits behind when he moved to
Santa Barbara in 1981. He and Wilkowski live in a woodsy Craftsman
house on the city's west side, but this is hardly retirement for
Brant. He has written a steady flow of new works in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   It was nearly half a century ago that Brant discovered space. The
concept goes back to Renaissance composer Giovanni Gabrieli and early
Baroque composer Claudio Monteverdi. Charles Ives--one of Brant's
heroes--also used it. His occasional compatriots in the field now
include Karlheinz Stockhausen and Elliott Carter.</TE>
<TE>   For Brant, the epiphany came in the form of the chamber piece
"Antiphony 1" in 1953, when he separated five groups of musicians
around a performance hall in New York, and got just the sort of
three-dimensional sound he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   His current count of spatial pieces is about 120 (he has done a
handful of works for conventional musical setups). Signature works
include 1979's "Orbits," for 80 dispersed trombones and an organ, or
1984's "Fire on the Amstel," in which boatloads of musicians
traversed the canals of Amsterdam. His inherently
architecture-oriented music helped christen the Dallas Symphony Hall
in 1990 with "Prisons of the Mind," for 314 carefully scattered
musicians. The New York Philharmonic performed his music for his 80th
birthday, and since then there has been a percussion piece outdoors
at Lincoln Center, an orchestral piece inside Carnegie Hall, and in
1997, a piece in Central Park called "Festive Eighty."</TE>
<TE>   But Brant's work hasn't been heard much, until recently, in
Southern California. His piece "Glossary," for a roving mezzo-soprano
and instrumentalists was performed last month in Los Angeles; his
first work done in L.A. in a dozen years. "An ingenious
contrapuntist," wrote Mark Swed in a review of the piece in The
Times, "Brant calculates just what music will fit where and the
effect is invariably exhilarating."</TE>
<TE>   Even before the Pulitzer, there was more planned. Brant is the
featured composer at the UC Santa Barbara New Music Festival, May
7-12. On April 21, his work "Prophets" will have its U.S. premiere in
Santa Barbara's First Methodist Church. It calls for four cantors
singing Old Testament texts and a shofar player.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden," Brant says, some local opportunities arrived.
"For quite a few years, there was nothing. That's the way it works.
It's happened to me so many times. It has looked like there is some
progress and that things would be better and all of a sudden, I'm
back to square one, and I stay there for five or 10 years. I guess
that's not a unique story."</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't the Pulitzer offer some safeguard against that now?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's the best news of today. I hope it results in
opportunities to do more things. I'm at the point where I think I
know what I'm doing better than before. Now I can make something with
a chance [it will be performed]. This may be it."</TE>
<TE>   And Brant is already thinking about the prospects. On Monday
afternoon, he excitedly shows visitors new scores and thumbs through
a book on concert halls around the world, pointing out halls that
would be best suited for his kind of compositional plotting. L.A.'s
soon-to-be finished Walt Disney Concert Hall has potential, he's
happy to point out.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the chance that "Ice Field" won't end up, like so
many new pieces, a work whose premiere is also its finale.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, that would be fine," he says and laughs, "but you know, the
unwritten pieces are always the best, or at least they seem so at the
time."</TE>

<LD>Writer-director Mitch Davis had everything he needed to whip up a
hurricane on Rarotonga, a tiny verdant island off the coast of New
Zealand, for the climactic scene in his first major film, "The Other
Side of Heaven." Four cameras were trained on the chaos created by
several giant fans, clouds of artificial debris, rain towers and fire
hoses operated by two stuntmen. Several trees and "huts" had been
rigged with bungee cords to blow away on cue.</LD>
<LD>   With just 20 minutes of daylight remaining, Davis was poised to
call "action" when he noticed the actors weren't in place. Instead,
they were dodging water blasts from a misdirected fire hose. The
director followed the stream to a stuntman high above the set, who
was filming the chaos on his own video camera, while unknowingly
pounding the actors with water.</LD>
<TE>   To get the stuntman's attention, Davis waved his arms. The actors
spotted Davis, took his signal as "action" and took off running
through the "storm." The huts blew away on cue. Trees fell. And
suddenly, the scene was over. "And we didn't have a single frame of
film to show for it," Davis said during a phone interview Monday. In
the melee, Davis had neglected to cue the cameras. "It was a humbling
moment," he said. The mistake put the production half a day behind
schedule, a huge loss for the independent film. But crews worked
through the night to rebuild the set, and the scene was reshot in the
morning--with cameras rolling.</TE>
<TE>   The film, which stars Christopher Gorham as an Idaho farm boy who
leaves his girlfriend (Anne Hathaway) to work as a missionary on a
South Pacific island, opens Friday, hurricane in place.</TE>
<TE>   French Toast</TE>
<TE>   Director Bertrand Tavernier held Jacqueline Bisset in his arms.
Then, moments later, he fell into John Frankenheimer's arms and began
talking about his love for "The Manchurian Candidate."</TE>
<TE>   The occasion for the hugging, air-kissing and back-patting was the
opening-night gala for the French film festival City of Lights, City
of Angels and the screening of Tavernier's "Laissez-Passer" ("Safe
Conduct"), a movie about movie-making during World War II, screened
for a movie-making audience at the Directors Guild of America Theatre
on Sunset Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, [the festival] is a way of showing the movies to people
we admire, like ... " Tavernier said, gesturing with a stab of his
thumb toward Frankenheimer, who was now standing behind him. "It's a
good way to meet and to go on with our collaboration."</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, to lift the flute.</TE>
<TE>   Both champagne and appetizers were in high demand. One woman who
really liked the tuna sashimi, said, with a faint apology, "It's for
my husband," after grabbing several pieces. The waiter looked at her
squarely and replied, with the whiff of a smile, "but you don't have
a husband." Unfazed, she retorted: "I'll go and find one," before
vanishing in the Monday night crowd of several hundred French and
Francophile guests.</TE>
<TE>   Frankenheimer, surrounded by fans and friends in the main room,
beamed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see this kind of a turnout," he said. "To see the
American and French directors, producers and writers to come together
like this is wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Even Jack Valenti came from Washington, D.C., to show his respects
(and to kiss the back of Bisset's hands.)</TE>
<TE>   "To see this happen ... ," said Tavernier after Valenti's
introduction. He grinned. "Anything is possible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Evil' Preview</TE>
<TE>   Parents started yelling during an "Ice Age" showing Saturday at
the Pacific Theaters in Sherman Oaks when a trailer for the R-rated
film "Resident Evil" was shown to an audience with many children
present. After the parents' protests, and a slight delay, a more
family-friendly preview reel was located and put on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I've never come across a bad kisser," actress/pop singer Jennifer
Lopez said of her leading men in the May issue of Cosmopolitan, due
out Tuesday. "All actors have their thing. But I would have to say
Sean Penn, who I kissed in [the film] 'U-Turn' was the best. I just
remembered thinking that at the time."</TE>

<HD>Breakfast at Graceland: Crepes on Granite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Erskine</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mom's making crepes," the little girl says.</LD>
<LD>   "Great," I say.</LD>
<LD>   "What do you like on your crepes?" she asks.</LD>
<TE>   "Veal tenderloin," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I'll go tell her," the little girl says, running off to place
my breakfast order.</TE>
<TE>   Here at our little Graceland, we love to eat. So after 20 years of
marriage, some more sensational than others, I am finally giving my
wife the kitchen she deserves--a place to stuff crepes and season a
steak, a place to make love and school lunches.</TE>
<TE>   OK, maybe not love. But every other goopy dish you crave. Here at
Graceland, food is how we show affection.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom's making manicotti," the little girl says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yum."</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want with it?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Milkshakes," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In a week, the old kitchen will be gone. Then they'll bring in a
new kitchen. It'll be like magic how quickly it all happens.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, you're renovating?" a neighbor asks after contractors deliver
a gigantic dumpster.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be chaos," the neighbor predicts.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks. But we're used to chaos. We have chaos for breakfast,
along with three kinds of cereal, muffins, oatmeal, melon, fresh
strawberries, Easter candy and piping-hot coffee made with this fancy
new machine my wife received for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's not just an ordinary coffeemaker. Nothing's
ordinary anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing takes forever to clean," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's worth it," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   Another unsatisfying spousal reply, delivered from a foot away, by
my bride of two decades--the one with the Marlo Thomas eyes. From a
foot away, maybe less. In the movies, that's kissing distance.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't even like coffee," I growl.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you still drink Bosco," she growls back.</TE>
<TE>   Ever notice the Doppler Effect of marriage? The closer you get,
the worse you communicate?</TE>
<TE>   From a room away, we seem to get along fine. Then, as we close the
distance between us, something happens to raise the tension. Train
whistles blow. Bells clang. Then all marriage breaks loose.</TE>
<TE>   "This coffee maker has 20 parts," I complain.</TE>
<TE>   "So?"</TE>
<TE>   "Where do I put this?" I say, holding up a plastic funnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't tempt me," my wife warns.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tricky project, a new kitchen. There is plumbing and
electricity to deal with. Flooring. Cabinets. Lighting.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, proper spacing. You don't want a kitchen so big
that you're not bumping backsides. Bumping backsides is one of the
little pleasures a kitchen gives. Plus it heightens the illusion of
togetherness that is so important in a modern relationship.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey quit bumping me," I tell her.</TE>
<TE>   "You're bumping me," my bride says.</TE>
<TE>   "If you insist," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Along the counter, like squares of toast, my wife has placed
several little pieces of granite. They're samples for the new granite
countertops we're considering, more stuff we can't afford.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, I'm not sure how we managed to afford this tiny house
in the leafy suburb, let alone this renovation. We're probably paying
in manicotti. With side orders of crepes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I like the dark gray," my wife says, tilting her head as
she studies the granite samples. "You?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yellow Formica," I say.</TE>
<TE>   To me, there's nothing really wrong with the current kitchen.
Built in 1443, it has a scruffy charm. Pirates once owned it. For a
while, it housed sheep. Then a couple who subscribed to Car &amp; Driver
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   After 500 years, the kitchen now smells of scrambled eggs even
when we're not having scrambled eggs. It takes centuries of bad
breakfasts to acquire a smell like that. The patina on our Acropolis.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I like this one," my wife says, studying a second granite
sample.</TE>
<TE>   "Perfect," I say. "We'll look like the Luxor."</TE>
<TE>   "This is serious," she says rather seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this is serious. It's serious because our friends Hank and
Martha have granite countertops. Don and Kate, too. Everyone seems to
have granite countertops, and if we don't get some soon, some other
new surface might come along and we'd miss out on this unnecessary
but expensive trend. Granite, the stuff of kitchen counters and
tombstones.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Bill and Nancy's counters," says my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill's a Republican," I say, explaining the various caste systems
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "And Nancy doesn't work," she reminds me.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, but my wife does. So I guess she's going to get her granite
countertops. Hank and Martha. Bill and Nancy. Don and Kate. The whole
world's gone granite. Why not us?</TE>
<TE>   Because here at Graceland, granite is how we show affection.</TE>

<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Angelenos have a habit of waxing nostalgic that is both endearing and
ironic. Even people who moved here from Des Moines three months ago
will look you straight in the eye and rhapsodize over the orange
groves that once rose in frothy fragrance in areas that are always
geographically hazy in the telling. And folks who actually grew up
here, well, don't get them started. About the pony rides and the old
Bullock's Wilshire, about the Red Line and the gondolas in Venice,
about Malibu before Gladstone's and Santa Monica before the Third
Street Promenade.</LD>
<LD>   But no topic is as fraught with tender remembrance than traffic.
"I remember when you could get from Long Beach to Hollywood in 20
minutes. On a Saturday evening."</LD>
<LD>   "I remember when you could leave downtown at 5 and have your toes
in the sand by 6."</LD>
<TE>   "I remember when Santa Monica Boulevard was the fastest street
cross town," when "Sepulveda was faster than the 405," when "PCH
would get you to Santa Barbara in an hour and a half," when "you
could bowl down Olympic at rush hour."</TE>
<TE>   Giving voice to such memories will transform the face of any
Angeleno. The eyes fix themselves longingly on the middle distance,
the mouth goes soft and vulnerable, the brow relaxes, and an image of
the past rises as if on a lantern screen above their heads. A past
when drivers never missed a light, when street parking bloomed in
abundance, when the city was latticed with freeways and streets that
hissed and shone with speed, when everyone used their turn signals
and no one ran an amber, much less a red.</TE>
<TE>   It's like watching "Kate &amp; Leopold," in which overwrought career
gal Meg Ryan blithely chooses to live in 19th century New York where
there are no tampons, no antibiotics, no birth control and women do
not yet have the vote. Ah, yes, those were the days.</TE>
<TE>   The thing that makes traffic in Los Angeles a problem is that so
many people live here. On a regular basis people move here,
presumably because it's such a swell place to live, and the traffic
gets worse and then people, especially the ones who just moved here,
complain about it. But unless you are descended from indigenous
tribes, you are part of the problem, my friend. You came, you saw,
you rented a car and took up another 20 feet on the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who really wants to improve traffic conditions in L.A.
should just go back to Des Moines. Or Miami Beach. Or Chicago. Or
wherever their great-grandparents came from. Then those who remain
will once again be able to get from Long Beach to Hollywood in 20
minutes. Like that's some sort of cultural accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   So when someone or other speaks rapturously about the past,
remember that what they're really saying is, "Back when you people
who came after me, including my spouse and children, weren't here,
things were just great."</TE>
<TE>   No matter the topic, nostalgia seems inappropriate coming from the
denizens of one of the newest, most modern cities in the country. It
is also an odd hobby for a culture that unapologetically deifies
youth. Angelenos seem to forget that nostalgia is pretty much by
definition the property of the elderly. The only people who used to
care that there was ever such a thing as penny candy and that a big
bottle of Pepsi went for a nickel were old codgers with nothing
better to do.</TE>
<TE>   But what with computers and cell phones and DVDs, we've pretty
much washed our hands of the traditional space-time continuum, so
perhaps it really isn't odd at all to hear a 27-year-old speak
wistfully of the way things were "when I was a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Or to realize we are teetering on the edge of a new preemptive
nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when there was free parking at the Farmers Market,"
one young man recently was heard to sigh to another.</TE>
<TE>   That's because there still is.</TE>

<HD>Historian Traces Path of a Violent Civil War General</HD>
<DH>Scholar* From her Mississippi upbringing, Margie Riddle
Bearss has been interested in what sparked Sherman's campaign
tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHIL McCOMBS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>"I don't think I'm worth writing about," she told me. "I haven't done
much." Then she quoted Emily Dickinson:</LD>
<LD>   I'm Nobody! Who are you?</LD>
<LD>   Are you--Nobody--Too?</LD>
<TE>   She chuckled. I liked her a lot. I wanted to write about her.</TE>
<TE>   Margie Riddle Bearss, 76, is the wife of Ed Bearss, historian
emeritus of the National Park Service famous for his Homeric
monologues while conducting Civil War tours. I wrote recently about
Ed, a chipper dynamo who at 78 still does 40 tours a year, and in
doing so met Margie briefly by phone.</TE>
<TE>   They're a historical team, though Margie was largely incapacitated
15 years ago by heart problems and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   She's proofread and indexed Ed's 15 books, handled correspondence,
arranged tours, traveled with him--to say nothing of having dinner on
the table regularly while raising their three kids.</TE>
<TE>   In passing, Margie mentioned that she, too, had written a
book-about an obscure campaign of Union Gen. William Tecumseh
Sherman. I wanted to know more.</TE>
<TE>   When I swung by the Bearsses' little book-filled house in suburban
Arlington, Va., to chat with Margie, she was on the porch opening her
mail.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's a letter from a guy in Texas who found the gun of a
soldier killed in a battle I wrote about," she said with a cheerful
grin. "The soldier was killed in the Decatur Skirmish, which involved
my favorite regiment, Wirt Adams' cavalry. Wirt Adams is my hero. He
held his finger in the dike, harassing the Yankees and keeping them
from doing more damage."</TE>
<TE>   As a Yank with scant knowledge of the Civil War, I realized I
might learn something from Margie.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a good and exciting life," she reflected. "It started on
a Mississippi farm during the Depression. My people were very poor.
Daddy ran a sawmill. Mama came down from Illinois when she was 18.
Her father came down because he'd heard the climate gave two crops a
year. He thought he'd get rich but never did."</TE>
<TE>   A self-described introvert ("Ed's the extrovert"), she always
loved books. "But there was no town or county library when I was a
girl, and the school library burned. All I had was the Bible and
Mom's old 12th-grade literature book, which I memorized."</TE>
<TE>   Margie became a teacher in Lexington, Miss. Her interest in the
Civil War was intense because her home village, Brandon, had been
burned by Sherman's troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy would take me to an old spring off in the woods and say,
'This is where Sherman's men filled their canteens.' Daddy's friend,
Mr. Ferguson, had been a little boy at the time, and [told him]
Sherman's troops would make him drink out of the spring first to make
sure nobody had poisoned it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sherman was in Brandon about 6 or 7 February, 1864. His men
looted and burned everything. My book is about his raid across
Mississippi, 'Sherman's Forgotten Campaign: The Meridian Expedition.'
This is the first time Sherman used the scorched-earth policy. He
went wild."</TE>
<TE>   Sherman became famous for that policy later with his devastating
march to the sea through Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Margie how she met Ed, a Montana boy who in 1955 had
become national park historian at Vicksburg, Miss., where he
discovered the underwater remains of the Union ironclad Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   "I was researching Sherman and went by Vicksburg to ask about it.
Ed couldn't figure out why a Southern girl was interested in Sherman.
I wasn't interested in Ed, but the diaries of soldiers and maps he
showed me were wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Ed was interested in her, however. He appeared at her house 50
miles away, took her for coffee, and was stunned that she knew more
about a certain battle than he did.</TE>
<TE>   "The second time he showed up, my landlady said, 'There's a man
outside with a cannonball in one hand and a bunch of old books in
another.'"</TE>
<TE>   They married July 30, 1958. Sara was born in '60, Edwin Jr. in '62
and Mary in '65--but Margie also found time to help Ed with his work,
catalog thousands of artifacts from the Cairo, prepare exhibits and
historical markers for Grand Gulf Military Monument Park, and pursue
a question: Why was Sherman so ruthless?</TE>
<TE>   She came up with a fascinating speculation. After the Union
victory at Vicksburg on July 4, 1863, she writes: "Sherman's wife,
Ellen, came down from Ohio and brought their four oldest children.
Minnie was 12 years old, Lizzie was 11, Willie was 9, and Tom was 7.
For the children it was an exciting adventure. They all lived in
tents. (An uncle) saw that Willie learned the manual of arms and knew
how to drill."</TE>
<TE>   Then Willie, his father's favorite, died of typhoid fever. Sherman
was insane with grief, blaming himself for bringing the boy, as he
wrote, to "that sickly region in the summertime." If only he'd died
at Vicksburg, he wrote his wife later, then Willie would have lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Did, perhaps, the death of Willie start a chain reaction of fires
and desolation in Mississippi that the winds of more than a century
have not entirely hidden?" Margie wrote. "Did Sherman hold
Mississippi, 'that sickly region,' responsible? Who knows?</TE>
<TE>   "Yet, we do know that between the end of the Vicksburg Campaign
and the beginning of the Meridian Campaign ... his concept of warfare
changed and he began his own version of the 'total war' for which he
became well-known.</TE>
<TE>   "We also know that the region through which his soldiers marched
in February 1864, across the heart of Mississippi, was left more
scourged and desolated than the area he covered in the March to the
Sea."</TE>
<TE>   It will always be a riddle.</TE>

<LD>Six Rules of Bike Riding</LD>
<LD>   Otto the Auto is a robotic car that visits classes throughout
Southern California, free of charge. Otto teaches children about
traffic safety through songs, blinking headlights and friendly
presentations in English and Spanish. Today he talks to Julia about
bike safety.</LD>
<LD>   The morning was bright and cheerful as Julia pedaled her new
bicycle along the sidewalk near her house. As she rode past the park,
she met her friend Otto the Auto.</LD>
<TE>   "Hi, Julia," Otto called. "Wow, I love your new bike."</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks, Otto," Julia replied. "My mom and dad gave it to me. I
loved it so much when I saw it that I could hardly wait to try it
out."</TE>
<TE>   As Otto admired the pink and purple colors on the bike, he asked
if Julia's parents had told her about the six rules of bike riding.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we talked about safety, but I didn't know there were six
rules," Julia said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have obeyed the first two rules already, by always wearing a
properly fitting helmet and by riding a bike that you can straddle
with both feet flat on the ground. That's very important," Otto said.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents tell me that kids my age should always stay on bike
paths, on sidewalks or in parks and not on the street," she said.
"Also, to look for cars at driveways, alleys and streets."</TE>
<TE>   "You know almost all of them already!" Otto exclaimed. "The others
are to be careful around pedestrians and never to ride your bike
after dark."</TE>
<TE>   "Those are great rules and easy to remember," Julia said. "Thanks,
Otto. Safety is fun and easy with a friend like you."</TE>
<TE>   Principals can arrange for Otto to visit schools by contacting the
Automobile Club of Southern California at (714) 885-2317. Visit
Otto's Web site at www.aaa-calif.com/otto for parent and teacher
information and fun activities for kids.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A father, a daughter, a balloon. They are just now heading toward the
car, hand in hand, toddling down the driveway. It is the same way
every week. They're going to the grocery store. They'll get a free
sample of cheese, they'll get a free cookie, she'll ride in the cart
awhile, then get down and push. He'll say, "Whose little girl are
you?" She'll say, "Daddy's!"</LD>
<LD>   It is the same way every single week. Except there isn't always a
balloon. He's an older dad, well into his 50s.</LD>
<LD>   She's a younger child, barely 3. The balloon is 2 days old,
practically ancient in the life of a standard-issue balloon. It is
red. It's tied to the end of a purple ribbon. It has fewer thoughts
than a household pet, and yet, to a 3-year-old, it is in every way a
pet. You have to take care of it, and it won't last forever. But for
the time being, it is yours.</LD>
<TE>   "Would you like me to tie the balloon around your wrist?" he is
saying, already knowing the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to hold it," she says. "I would like to hold my
balloon in my hand."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, sweetie," he says. "Well, hold on tight."</TE>
<TE>   The balloon has lost a good bit of its helium, and there is no
wind, and so the balloon appears to be walking one step behind her,
at just her height.</TE>
<TE>   The balloon gets loose. The balloon is floating in the air, just
above the father's head. "Oh, no!" she is saying. He reaches into the
air, tries to pluck it from the sky, but the balloon at that moment
catches an updraft and lifts higher, just beyond his grasp.</TE>
<TE>   He tries again; this time he leaps. But the balloon goes a foot
higher, hangs there stupidly.</TE>
<TE>   "My balloon," she cries, craning her neck so as to make a more
direct appeal. "Please, balloon! Please, Daddy! Oh, my balloon ..."</TE>
<TE>   Another father might say, "I told you, honey, I told you to hold
on tight!" Another might think, we have to hurry, we have a long list
of groceries. Another might think, we can just buy another balloon at
the store. This is one way a father, old or young, finds out who he
is, with no time to decide which one he should be, which one he wants
to be, which one might, perhaps, look better. When a balloon is
loose, there is no time. You either charge after it, or you don't.</TE>
<TE>   And so he finds that he is the kind of man who charges after a
loose balloon, charges after it with courage and fight. He isn't
aware of his heroism, or his foolishness, he is too busy chasing a
balloon. He hops, runs, reaches, trots over the grass and trips into
the boxwoods. That balloon is either dancing or flirting or maybe a
little of both. It doesn't have enough loft to go into the clouds,
no, it hovers, dragging its purple ribbon just beyond his pleading
fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   "Get it, Daddy!" she is saying, cheering him on. It is all he
needs to hear. It is fuel. He leaps a few more times until he gets an
idea. He's going to outsmart that balloon. He calculates its
direction, like a receiver estimating the trajectory of a touchdown
pass, and he runs past it, up a little hill, to the top of a wall,
off of which he can hurl himself, and go for the grab.</TE>
<TE>   One, two, three--the timing here is critical--and he leaps! And
don't you know that balloon darts left. Left? The balloon is now over
the wall, high in the air. To another father, that balloon would be a
goner for sure. But not him. Not yet. He wonders how he might break
the news to her. He thinks, "Life isn't fair."</TE>
<TE>   Just then the first real breeze of the day kicks in, and the
balloon makes a U-turn, an absolute about-face. It drifts toward him,
closer now, and closer. He hops at just the right moment. He feels
the ribbon like a tickle between his fingers and so he grabs, he
grabs happiness out of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "Aaaah!" she says, her mouth dropping open. "You did it! Daddy did
it!" She can't quite believe it's true. Her father has performed a
miracle. Her balloon is back. And life, to her--but also to him--has
plenty more fairness left.</TE>

<HD>The Darker Side of the City of Light</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DICK LOCHTE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Considering that America's first detective story, Edgar Allan Poe's
"The Murders in the Rue Morgue," was set in Paris, it's surprising
that more of this country's crime writers don't spend time exploring
the dark side of the City of Light. Cara Black, a travel-prone author
currently based in San Francisco, is doing her part to correct this
omission. Her "Murder in the Sentier" (Soho, $24, 336 pages) is the
third entry in an intriguing new series featuring Aimee Leduc, a
young private eye who, with her resourcefulness and jaded outlook,
might be described as the Parisienne Kinsey Millhone. (Like Sue
Grafton's novels, which are set in the 1980s, Black's take place in
the recent past, in 1994.)</LD>
<LD>   Though Millhone is no slouch when it comes to family baggage,
Leduc's parents have left her in a whole new world of psychological
unrest, a situation that forms the basis for this new novel. In the
midst of wheeling and dealing to keep her late father's detective
agency financially afloat, Leduc is approached by a woman claiming to
have been the cellmate of her long-missing American-born mother,
claiming also that they both had earned their imprisonment by being
members of a Red terrorist brigade in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   When the ex-convict is murdered in the Sentier, the "rag trade"
district of Paris, Leduc is compelled to investigate the crime and
the claims. She can't stop, even when her probing uncovers
information that suggests her father, an ex-Paris cop, may have been
crooked. Black keeps the tale taut and tricky, with aging survivors
of the gang being bumped off and Leduc dodging both murderous
assaults and the police while relentlessly pursuing the truth about
her parents.</TE>
<TE>   We're taken on a remarkably vivid tour along the city's streets,
inside fascinating shops and homes (including the heroine's apartment
overlooking the Seine), and backstage and on the runway at a wild
fashion show complete with a roller-blader taking electronic orders.
There's even some fancy computer work, one of the Leduc Agency's
specialties, courtesy of Rene, Leduc's dwarf partner, a hacker
extraordinaire. With its sights, sounds and colorful cast, it's a
particularly eventful and involving Paris visit.</TE>
<TE>   Twists and Turns</TE>
<TE>   With a 'Snakehead'</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Deaver's "The Stone Monkey" (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25, 432
pages) marks the return of quadriplegic NYPD forensic detective
Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs, his partner in both detection and
romance. It begins with a vicious gent known only as The Ghost
sinking a ship filled with undocumented Chinese immigrants near Long
Island.</TE>
<TE>   The Ghost is a people smuggler, or "snakehead," to use the book's
apt appellation. Not satisfied with drowning a number of passengers
and crew, he then proceeds to hunt down and murder those managing to
make it to shore. Two families escape all the way to New York, with
The Ghost in deadly pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, Immigration and the NYPD all are involved in trying to
stop the homicidal snakehead, but the task of locating him and his
potential victims falls to Rhyme and Sachs. Following Deaver's proven
successful format, fans can expect to be led down several false
paths. The seemingly villainous will turn out just; the innocent will
be found guilty; information accepted as fact will be disproved; and
cleverly planted clues will eventually provide all the answers.</TE>
<TE>   Two elements make "Monkey" a more enjoyable read than the last
several Rhymes. The romance between the physically impaired hero and
the physically adroit heroine has moved beyond being just a part of
the suspense package to a relationship that seems natural and
unforced. And the abundance of Chinese culture that the book presents
is fascinating. If it's the result of research, Deaver has done a
shrewd job of integrating it into his tale. If he made it up, he's a
genius.</TE>
<TE>   Nuclear Weapons and International Intrigue</TE>
<TE>   With "Kelly's People" (Forge/Tom Doherty, $24.95, 352 pages),
veteran suspense novelist Walter Wager returns to the world-at-risk,
spy-versus-spy games that he described so entertainingly in books
like "Telefon" and "Time of Reckoning." In what appears to be the
start of a new series, the book takes us inside a secret facility
somewhere in this country where five superlative espionage agents
have arrived after transplant operations that saved their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the special pills and "dark fluid" necessary for their
continued survival, they are spoon-fed bits and pieces of information
about their current status. The real reason for their assembly is to
test their combined powers of ESP. Since the test is a rousing
success, their hosts' motives soon become clear: They're the new
weapons in America's battle against international terrorism. And
they've been loaded for action a little too late for an African town
that has been decimated by a small nuclear device known as a Demon.</TE>
<TE>   A smarmy Russian general has developed his own method for reducing
his country's nuclear stockpile. He's sold their Demon arsenal to a
certain Middle Eastern client. That client leveled the African
community just to test the product. Now he has sent Demons on their
way to three of his least favorite cities in the world, and it's up
to the psychic five, led by the dynamic, wisecracking super-agent
Denny Monroe, to uncover the targets, find and disarm the bombs and
then decommission the terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, "Kelly's People" will not be mistaken for a John
le Carre novel.</TE>
<TE>   But those who've enjoyed the breathless, imaginative,
no-holds-barred international thrillers of the late Ian Fleming and
Robert Ludlum should be pleased with Wager's sly addition to the
genre.</TE>

<HD>Poets of Southern California Are Pulled Into View</HD>
<DH>Hundreds gather for 'The Big Picture,' a 'happening' to
record a community that can be difficult to define.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the broad lawn of Beyond Baroque, the venerable literary arts
center in Venice, they fall together in semi-straight lines under a
cloudy-bright sky: Part-time poets. Silenced poets. Mentor poets.
Performance poets. Geographically challenged poets.
Come-hell-or-high-water poets.</LD>
<LD>   Among the assembled group of nearly 300, some wear thrift-store
dashikis or rumpled top hats, fencing masks or Stetsons. Others carry
portraits of absent or sick poet friends.</LD>
<LD>   Dotting the perimeter are the hand-carried details that only poets
could arrange precisely on the page of a day: Tarot cards, mud cloth
sashes, nosegays of lavender, baskets of vivid strawberries,
pass-around bottle of gin. Above it all, installed in a rented cherry
picker on the Venice Boulevard sidewalk, photographer Mark Savage
peers through the viewfinder of his Mamiya at an antsy assembly that
answers his gaze with giggling and catcalls.</LD>
<TE>   Savage calls the portrait he is about to make "The Big Picture,"
and with it hopes to capture, and thus celebrate, a moment in the
life of poets in Southern California, whose community is notoriously
difficult to frame, and even more difficult to keep in focus. Echoes
of photographer Art Kane's "Jazz Portrait, in Harlem, 1958" (made
more famous by a documentary "A Great Day in Harlem"), the indelible
portrait of 57 jazz greats who collectively spanned the history of
jazz, color the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Often hidden behind the cliche that writer, here, means
screenwriter, the region's poets have more than made do with their
stealth life, filling elite writing programs, winning prizes and
organizing various kinetic literary centers and collectives.</TE>
<TE>   But the low profile of the poetic personalities and styles hidden
in L.A.'s sprawl has always been an issue. "It's the problem about
here ...," says poet and anthologist Bill Mohr, negotiating hugs,
shrieks and disposable-camera paparazzi as he crosses the lawn. "This
is about making a group of writers visible. It will make people
think, 'How could we have missed so many poets?' This is a thriving
rambunctious community. This is awesome."</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Picture," then, is an outing, in both senses of the word.
It's part reunion, part happening, part wake (for two who died on
Easter weekend: Venice beat icon and poet John Thomas and Marta
Mitrovich, a seminal figure in Orange County poetry). The event is
the collective brainchild of Savage, Fred Dewey, the director of
Beyond Baroque, and Amelie Frank, a member of the Valley Contemporary
Poets. For five years, Savage has been compiling a visual catalog of
L.A.'s poetry community with a series of stirring, intimate
portraits. "I want the photographs to be as individual as they are,"
he says. And "The Big Picture," which will go on display at Beyond
Baroque in several weeks, will draw these disparate spirits together.</TE>
<TE>   The trio's effort involves not just convening the poets, but
looking more deeply into their work. "We've been trying to get more
involved in documenting L.A. poetry history, high-caliber work across
genres," says Dewey. "I was looking for a way to preserve not just
what is happening but the scope of what was happening, and start new
dialogues. You can't create new work if you don't have a sense of
your history."</TE>
<TE>   Just Who Is a</TE>
<TE>   Poet, Anyway?</TE>
<TE>   In style as in substance, the image of the Southern California
poet is as elusive as a fresh simile. Everyone's a poet: your
next-door neighbor, the man who helps you select your weekend videos,
the bookstore regular who once whiled away his lunch hour in
belles-lettres --they've all made their way here today.</TE>
<TE>   But for all the freedom that suggests, says Frank, it has often
presented a quandary, both inside the community and out: Just who is
a poet? And what is poetry?</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, says Dewey, as "Big Picture" planners tried to decide
whom to include, "there was some dispute over the question of whether
it should be major poets? Major published poets? Everyone who is
actively involved in poetry?"</TE>
<TE>   A steering committee of 15 plucked from various corners of L.A.'s
literary community met in person and online to hash out particulars
from the philosophical ("Who is a poet?") to the practical ("Will we
need Porta Pottis?").</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, when it came to finalizing the guest list, says Frank,
"the buck stopped at my desk. My criteria were: They have to be a
poet. They have to be serious, they can't be someone that goes to the
mike to read from a journal. Publication is totally important, but
it's not the only requirement. There are fellowships, poetry hosts,
teachers who have put their own work aside. There are spoken-word
artists, academics who haven't produced their own books. I'm not
letting jokers and clowns in. I'm not letting in songwriters or
stand-up comedians. And if you've been a jerk? This is not what it's
about."</TE>
<TE>   What it is about, says Dewey, is a concerted effort to document
the extent of people's writing. In many ways, "it's as if the city is
invisible to itself. It's hubris to conceive of it as a singular
base. Poets craft their language and present it to others. The
challenge was to physically bring it all together," says Dewey. "And
of course all of it is a bit like herding cats," he pauses,
searching. "Or impalas...."</TE>
<TE>   They Mingle, Try to</TE>
<TE>   Forget Old Feuds</TE>
<TE>   Pulled away from their long yellow pads, their dissertations or
blue-book grading, the poets mingle, as Dewey and Frank had hoped.
"There is a workshop I'm doing." "I read that you're living in San
Diego now?" Some are aghast at friends' gray hair. "My God!" shouts
one man, peering up at an old friend. "You're fat!"</TE>
<TE>   Emotions are tuned high. "I had a lot of mixed thoughts about
today," says music writer and poet Lynne Bronstein, eyeing Savage up
in his cherry picker moments before poet Larry Jaffe blasts his last
call for people to find their places. "There are feuds. Old stuff. I
figured, I'm trying to get into a positive mode. With John Thomas'
passing you realize how important it is to document. Only now do
people realize how hard his life was, that he had so little money. He
didn't have the money to get his teeth fixed. Then you think about
[the Oscars and] how much money these women pay to wear dresses for
one evening...."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Wolverton, a writer and former executive director of the
L.A. Women's Building, spends the afternoon retracing the steps of
her many lives in L.A. "If you had done this, say, 20 years ago, it
would have been a very different assembly," she says. "Not because
that there weren't a variety of poets out there. It's just that there
was so much isolation."</TE>
<TE>   Pulling together today's assemblage meant fliers, e-mail,
telephone trees--and plain old word-of-mouth at readings or
workshops.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, says Frank, with the invitation came the rules of
the day: no alcohol (quickly broken). No dress code (easily
followed). Bring a dish and copies of your work: broadsides, tapes,
chapbooks, anthologies. Much of the work arrives in grocery bags,
though some bring single 8-by-10 sheets sheathed in yellowing
plastic.</TE>
<TE>   April Declared Poetry</TE>
<TE>   Month in California</TE>
<TE>   Dewey rounds up the assembly. The governor's office has come with
a state proclamation declaring April California Poetry Month.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, Savage calls the group to order. Their wavy lines get
straighter. After a handful of tries, the group becomes quiet, and he
begins. One frame. Then another and another. He stands, bends. The
poets turn their faces upward, raise arms, wave. The sun peeks out,
then disappears again. After that, it's over.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," the photographer says as he stands, his pressed shirt now
wrinkled, glasses slightly askew, "let's party."</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this. All these poets coming together. I want to read
what all these people are working on!" shouts Michael Datcher, poet
and author of the memoir "Raising Fences."</TE>
<TE>   "I like this vibe," says Peter Harris, poet and host of
Inspiration House: VoiceMusic for Whole Living on KPFK-FM (90.7),
bending into the rhythm of the moment, as if he's bending into the
music formed by so many voices, languages rising.</TE>
<TE>   For all the differences, comparisons to Kane's famous Harlem jazz
portrait are immediate and unavoidable.</TE>
<TE>   "There is something in [this photo] that is different from 'A
Great Day in Harlem,'" says Paul Vangelisti, poet and chair of the
graduate writing program at Otis College of Art and Design. "If you
looked at that photo then went to a record store ... it tells you
exactly what was going on in jazz at that moment. Here, it is very
odd." He pauses, rolling the image over and over. "It documents L.A.
rather than poetry."</TE>
<TE>   To Imani Toliver, who came out of Leimert Park's World Stage, that
isn't necessarily a bad thing. For some, L.A. is neon and noir, but
for others, like Toliver, it might be the very first Kwanzaa, the
bales of hay at the first African Marketplace, or pet stores on
Melrose, "things you don't expect to come into the narrative. Another
kind of L.A. icon." The city, she explains, "inhabits your work in
all kinds of way. I have this funny relationship with Los Angeles.
There is this current that runs through it. Some are loud, like
Angelyne, others are quiet, the whispers of the native."</TE>
<TE>   Poets move in and out of the crowd. Some convene in circles,
eating muffins and tossing strawberries. Some read from their work.
Promises are made and long silences broken.</TE>
<TE>   Austin Straus turns to his wife, Wanda Coleman, and warns her that
the line for food is wrapped around the corner. He urges her to hurry
before it's all gone. "I didn't come to eat," says Coleman, "This
right here," the poet says casting a glance, "is the real food."</TE>

<HD>Putting a Face on Hatred</HD>
<DH>A woman with a thirst for revenge comes face to face with
the Palestinian who shot and wounded her father, a rabbi. But her
heart takes a surprising turn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUISE STEINMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who would want to hurt him?" Laura Blumenfeld used to wonder,
standing at the exact spot in the Jerusalem market where, in 1986,
her father was shot and wounded by a Palestinian terrorist. After the
shooting, Blumenfeld, reporting from Israel for the Washington Post,
was repeatedly drawn to that same place and to that same question.
Then the moment would pass, and she'd "go on writing about other
people's lives."</LD>
<LD>   On one particular day, however, standing again at the scene of the
crime, she noticed a single word--REVENGE--spray-painted in black on
a stone archway. At that moment, an idea lodged in her mind with
unabating intensity: "What if I could really track down the shooter?"</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the headlines bring their sad daily quota of deadly
suicide bombings and retaliatory reprisals in the Israeli-Palestinian
standoff, Blumenfeld's new book--"Revenge: A Story of Hope"--offers a
welcome antidote. Part memoir, part cultural history of revenge, the
book chronicles her obsession with her father's shooting, the actions
she undertook to avenge it and the surprising results of what the New
York Times called her "one-woman espionage plot."</LD>
<TE>   Blumenfeld's ambition was large and her intentions numerous: She
wanted to explore the origins of revenge, its rules, its motivations.
Why do some people need to get even and others don't?</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to break it down and study it. I wanted to master
revenge," she announces early in the narrative.</TE>
<TE>   To study it was the easy part--she would interview people who had
suffered from and acted on the revenge impulse. The hard part was the
personal experiment: following her own dark fantasies. She
acknowledged from the beginning that "the outcome was unclear, the
effort self-absorbed, the process full of ethical compromise." How
would she find an appropriate revenge, one that went "to the heart of
the crime?"</TE>
<TE>   How could she make the terrorist understand that it wasn't just
"some Jew" he had shot--it was her father? Most of all, how could she
make the shooter realize he had done something wrong?</TE>
<TE>   Violent Act Spawns</TE>
<TE>   a Daughter's Vow</TE>
<TE>   Blumenfeld was in college when her father, a New York rabbi, was
shot in Jerusalem. He was one of several tourists attacked by members
of a rebel faction of the PLO. He was fortunate. The bullet only
grazed his brain, leaving no lasting injuries. The same week as the
incident, in a writing seminar at Harvard, Blumenfeld wrote a poem
about the shooting that ended: "this hand will find you/I am his
daughter." She had already made a vow to avenge her father--but
didn't know yet what she meant by it.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by phone at the Upper West Side apartment in New York she
shares with her husband, a federal prosecutor, and her young son,
Blumenfeld, 38, explained why she took on the role of family avenger.
"I'm the kind of person who remembers things. I remind my husband,
'This is the fourth anniversary of our first date.'" She takes her
family's history quite seriously. "You could say that I'm the person
in charge of the 'Natural History of the Blumenfelds,'" she laughs.
"Families need to stand up for each other. It's a way of saying,
'We're worthy of respect.'"</TE>
<TE>   Blumenfeld dedicated a year in Israel, where the archaeology of
revenge is "layered all the way back to the beginning of time," to
her obsession with confronting the man who'd hurt her father. She was
no stranger to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a teenager, she
had joined Seeds for Peace, a program for Arab and Jewish youth that
emphasizes tolerance. She is fluent in Hebrew and comfortable in
Arabic. She covered the 1994 massacre at Hebron's Tomb of the
Patriarchs for the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after settling in Jerusalem, she was able to name the man
who shot her father: Omar Khatib. She learned he was serving a
25-year sentence in a prison in Ashkelon for the shooting. His
family, she discovered, lived in the West Bank village of Kalandia,
and "on a fiery July afternoon" in 1998, she arrived unannounced on
the family's doorstep. She did not tell family members she was David
Blumenfeld's daughter. "I was just Laura the journalist, no last
name."</TE>
<TE>   Her ability to keep up the deception surprised her. "It made me
wonder about myself," she says now. "I'd always thought of myself as
very warm, impulsive. I didn't hide my feelings." As she scribbled
notes in the living room of Khatib's family, she worried her body
would betray her: sweaty palms, furrowed brow, a heart that literally
skipped beats. One of the shooter's brother's thought he recognized
her from somewhere, an observation that made her heart beat even
faster. She had written about the reopening of homes in nearby
Ramallah in 1994, during the first days of Palestinian self-rule. Had
he seen her then? He wasn't sure.</TE>
<TE>   In response to her questions, the friendly Khatib family recounted
how Omar shot her father "one time in the head." "Why only once?" she
asked. The shooter's brother told her the attack "wasn't personal. It
was public relations." The scene is excruciating. How can she sit
there? Managing to appear sympathetic, she describes "a rising anger
that made me scrutinize them for the ugliest details. The father's
split toenails. The ceiling's cauliflower-shaped stains. The flies
raving in circles. The feces floating in their toilet. I noted
[Omar's] mother's breasts lumped beneath her pink robe, and hated
them for suckling him."</TE>
<TE>   She arrived back in Jerusalem after that first visit, distraught
and angry. "I was so repulsed--by them for dehumanizing my father, by
me for accepting their sugared tea--that I wanted to break something,
or someone."</TE>
<TE>   A Reporter's Skills,</TE>
<TE>   a Daughter's Mission</TE>
<TE>   For this assignment, Blumenfeld's professional skills as a
reporter waged war with her mission as a daughter. "As a reporter,
empathy was my greatest tool. As an avenger it was my biggest
threat." It weakened her resolve. The journalist in her was curious
about the shooter's motives. The daughter in her did not care why
Omar had hurt her father, only that he had.</TE>
<TE>   She admits that one identity seeped into the other, that she was
often confused--"part journalist, part lonely girl, part cartoon
avenger." She was on a tear, her thoughts of the shooter never far
from her mind. Her best friend, Rachel, told her she'd lost touch
with reality. During her "long, embroiled honeymoon year," her
understanding husband joked that God paired him with Laura as "divine
retribution for mistreating past girlfriends."</TE>
<TE>   To deepen her understanding of revenge, she extended her research
abroad. Among the diverse interviewees are a grand ayatollah in Iran
(who reminds her of her Polish grandfather) and a member of the
provincial Blood Feud Committee in Albania. The mayor of Palermo,
Sicily, tells her, "Here we have no limits on revenge." She
interviews Benjamin Netanyahu, then Prime Minister of Israel, whose
brother commanded and was killed in the famous raid to free hostages
in Entebbe, Uganda. She summons her nerve and asks Netanyahu if
Yasser Arafat had ever expressed his condolences. (The answer, not
surprisingly, is no.)</TE>
<TE>   She studies the anthropological evidence on predator-prey
relationships and concludes that revenge is probably hard-wired into
our brains. "It's very hard to resist the impulse to strike back.
Revenge is Darwinian. It's an animal instinct," she observes. After
interviewing a Bedouin Arab embroiled in a blood feud, she comes
closest to defining her subject: What is revenge? "Revenge," she
concludes, "is when you can walk away. But somehow, you cannot.
Something pulls you back."</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli chief of staff whom she interviews doubts that she has
"the intelligence or the resources" to track down the shooter. He's
wrong. He underestimates Blumenfeld's tenacity, her imagination, her
indispensable naivete, and her considerable personal courage as she
turns her contacts with Omar's family into a friendship, and
eventually a means of coming in contact with him.</TE>
<TE>   Blumenfeld is ultimately drawn to the idea of constructive
revenge. How can she turn what had been a destructive act (the
shooting of her father) into a force for good, for positive change?</TE>
<TE>   She realizes that, for many people, the emotional goal of revenge,
more than the desire to hurt, is to have the other person acknowledge
his mistake, acknowledge the legitimacy of the victims' pain. "The
only substitute for revenge is acknowledgment," a psychologist at
Hebrew University tells her. "Acknowledgment establishes a new
reality."</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, that is what she ultimately establishes with the
shooter, Omar Khatib. With his family as couriers, Blumenfeld
corresponds with the man who shot her father and finally, at his
parole hearing in 1999, she meets him face to face. In a courtroom
scene of high drama, Blumenfeld reveals her identity to the shooter,
his lawyer, his family and the court. She asks that Omar, who has
asthma, be given parole on medical grounds. She explains that he is
sorry, that he has promised never to hurt anyone again, that she has
come to know his family. Her mother blurts out, "If the Blumenfeld
family can forgive Omar, then it's time for the state of Israel to
forgive him."</TE>
<TE>   The judges are flabbergasted and impressed (though not enough to
set him free; they deny him parole until 2010).</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you do something so dangerous?" one judge asks her.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to take a chance for peace. You have to believe it's
possible," she answers. "I wanted them to understand this conflict is
between human beings and not disembodied Arabs and Jews. And we're
people. Not 'targets.' We're people with families. And you can't just
kill us."</TE>
<TE>   Victim Meets Shooter's</TE>
<TE>   Family for First Time</TE>
<TE>   Since Blumenfeld finished her book, relations between the
Palestinians and Israelis have plummeted to an all-time low. The
tragedy of Sept. 11, the intifada and the murder of Wall Street
Journal reporter Daniel Pearl all conspired against Blumenfeld
meeting again with the family of Omar Khatib. Phones were down, and
she could no longer call them. Then ABC journalist Diane Sawyer
pulled strings. With a camera crew in tow, Blumenfeld and her father
traveled to Kalandia in March, for a "PrimeTime" segment that aired
last week. Where before she had ridden a bus, this time they went in
an armored truck riddled with bullet holes.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was emotional. For Blumenfeld, it offered a sense of
completion. She was able to bring her father to the Khatibs, to make
him "real and human not just 'the Jew.'" To open the possibility of
real dialogue, she says, there has to be a way to see through the
stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinian children see Israelis as men with guns. Israelis see
Palestinians as terrorists. Or the man mopping their street, or
tending their garden," she says. At the meeting, Khatib's brother
explains to Blumenfeld's father, "We thought of things before in
terms of politics and ideologies. Laura taught us to see things on a
personal level."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one prescription right now for peace in the Middle East
would be to mobilize 30,000 Laura Blumenfelds on both sides of the
conflict to transform what is politically stagnant to something
constructively personal. For the time being, one woman's story of
hope--of people coming to understand their similarities by seeing
each other "up close"--may inspire others.</TE>

<HD>Jokes Tough to Judge: Humor's Funny That Way</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SHEA</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've never understood why it's considered bad form to speak ill of
the dead. I mean, is there anyone who could care less about what you
think?</LD>
<LD>   I bring this up because of what I'm about to say: I never found
Milton Berle funny.</LD>
<LD>   I understand the impact he had on early television. And I know
that he would make many people laugh so hard, they had stuff coming
out of their noses. But he never did it for me.</LD>
<TE>   As long as I'm on a roll, let me also say this: I never found
Dudley Moore funny either.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, he was OK in "Arthur," but I know a lot of people who play a
better drunk.</TE>
<TE>   So how come I never found either one funny, but millions of people
did? The answer might rest in the nature of humor itself. Take being
sad:</TE>
<TE>   You put 20 people together, and chances are you can get them all
to agree that something is sad--for example, a young father dies in a
car accident.</TE>
<TE>   Now ask those same 20 people to agree on what is funny.</TE>
<TE>   For example:</TE>
<TE>   Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton are traveling in a car
together when a tornado comes along and sucks them up into the air.
When they finally come down, they realize they're in Oz. They decide
to see the Wizard and have this exchange:</TE>
<TE>   Quayle: "I'm going to ask the Wizard for a brain."</TE>
<TE>   Gingrich: "I'm going to ask the Wizard for a heart."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton: "I'm going to ask the Wizard for Dorothy's phone number."</TE>
<TE>   OK, everybody who thought that was funny, raise your hands.</TE>
<TE>   Now, those of you who didn't.</TE>
<TE>   See, that's the thing about humor. It's elusive. Sadness is
universal; humor is personal. You find something funny or you don't.
No one knows why. What tickles us is all tied up in what makes us
tick.</TE>
<TE>   The randomness of humor was demonstrated on a grand scale last
year when a university professor from Britain set out to find the
world's funniest joke.</TE>
<TE>   After some 100,000 individuals across the globe weighed in, here
is what was determined to be the world's biggest knee-slapper:</TE>
<TE>   Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are on a camping trip. Holmes
awakens his companion in the night and asks him to "look up and tell
me what you deduce."</TE>
<TE>   Watson says: "I see millions of stars, and if even a few of those
have planets, it's quite likely that there are some planets like
Earth. And if there are a few planets out there like Earth, there
might also be life."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes replies: "Watson, you idiot; someone stole our tent."</TE>
<TE>   Funny? Sure. Funniest joke in the world?</TE>
<TE>   If you think that joke was good, or bad, consider this one:</TE>
<TE>   "Why is television called a medium? Because it is neither rare,
nor well done." That joke was a scream in Germany, a country whose
people rated more jokes "very funny" than any other nationality. Hey,
who knew?</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line on humor is that, while we might know what is
funny, we don't know what funny is. The subject is simply too broad
to be parsed.</TE>
<TE>   Just think of the number of forms humor can take. It can be
lighthearted, warm, witty. Or it can be satirical, insulting, cruel.
And we can find any of these approaches funny.</TE>
<TE>   If all that isn't perplexing enough, why does humor evolve?</TE>
<TE>   Why do I no longer find "The Smothers Brothers," "All in the
Family" or "MASH" funny? Is it a matter of time, or the times?</TE>
<TE>   If so, then why do I still find Richard Pryor and "The Mary Tyler
Moore Show" so amusing?Analyzing humor is a lot like contemplating
the universe. If you do it too much, you're just going to make your
head hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The funny thing is that of all the people who have tried to define
humor--Aristotle, Plato, Cicero among them--you know who I think
comes the closest?</TE>

<LD>Ral's problem was familiar to Barry. He knew how difficult coming up
with a new dish could be.</LD>
<LD>   "Come on into the kitchen," Barry said. "Maybe being in there will
inspire us." He hoped so, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   In the kitchen, Ral sat at the big wooden table while Barry and
his friends buzzed around looking for a suitable food. They ran into
each other and got into each other's way.</LD>
<TE>   "Wait a minute," Barry said. "Why don't we each present Ral with
our favorite food and see what he thinks of it?"</TE>
<TE>   Everybody agreed that was a good idea.</TE>
<TE>   First up was Kyle. "Not food, really," he said as he reached into
his pocket and pulled out a tiny bag of jelly beans and a packet of
chewing gum.</TE>
<TE>   Ral tried a red jelly bean first--Kyle's favorite--and then chewed
on the spearmint gum for a while. Watching his mouth work from side
to side rather than up and down was really strange.</TE>
<TE>   Ral agreed that the candies were quite nice for a snack, but not
as a birthday meal to feed the emperor and his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "How about this?" Alexis said. She nuked a frozen pizza in the
microwave oven. When it was hot she set it before Ral on a plate.</TE>
<TE>   He tried to eat it, but because his mouth was vertical instead of
horizontal, the toppings kept sliding off. "Tastes great," Ral said.
"But what a mess."</TE>
<TE>   The kids could only agree.</TE>
<TE>   Kyle suggested ice cream, and he dished up some of the rocky road
that was in the freezer. "Almost," Ral said. "Maybe for dessert. But
I still need a main course."</TE>
<TE>   "Sherlock really likes dog treats," Kyle said.</TE>
<TE>   Ral tried one and found it a little dry.</TE>
<TE>   "I have another idea," Barry said, as he ran from the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday: Does Barry come up with the perfect dish?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mel Gilden likes to cook even though he still makes crumbs when he
eats. His books and stories always contain food jokes. This story

<HD>Scholar Examines the Decline of Marriage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF RIVERS</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "The Marriage Problem," James Q. Wilson, a leading social
scientist and expert on crime and public policy, synthesizes and
interprets the work of others to present stark and disturbing points
about the decline of marriage as a stabilizing influence on society.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson has had a long and influential career. For more than 20
years, he taught political science at Harvard. He has been a
professor of management at UCLA and teaches at Pepperdine University.</LD>
<LD>   In some ways, his book, published by HarperCollins, is a
continuation of the scholarship that has made him an influential
academic. And it comes at a time when marriage is being presented by
some conservative policymakers as a way to sew up a society they
believe is unraveling, especially at the margins.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration has proposed a welfare plan that includes
spending $300 million to promote marriage. It drew praise from the
right and condemnation from the left.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson says he doesn't think people can marry their way out of
poverty or that groups or nations prosper because of their moral
values, no matter how those values might be assessed and interpreted.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he believes that there are two nations in America, and the
one in which marriage is becoming rare suffers an array of social
pathologies as a result.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Marriage Problem," Wilson says, "The children of single
moms are more likely than those of two-parent families to be abused,
to drop out of or be expelled from school, to become juvenile
delinquents, to take drugs and to commit adult crimes."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he began the book with the assumption that changing
attitudes toward marriage could be traced to the 1960s. But his
research led him to causes centuries earlier. He believes the decline
in marriage is rooted in the European Enlightenment of the 18th and
19th centuries, and the movement toward greater personal freedoms and
individual rights can be traced to the Magna Carta in the 13th
century. Wilson is most concerned about the near-absence of marriage
among the black poor in America's big cities today. In the book, he
quotes sociologist Elijah Anderson, who describes "a second culture
of young, marginally employed, sexually adventuresome, socially
aggressive young men who reject the idea of hard work and social
conformity that made their elders successful."</TE>
<TE>   Although the book offers little data to prove it, Wilson posits
that this group's attitudes toward marriage results from an unholy
trinity of the legacy of the Enlightenment, slavery and an African
family structure that favors the extended family, or village concept,
of child-rearing over the nuclear family.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson says there has been little research on African families of
200 to 300 years ago, and contemporary research is limited to just a
few African countries. Nevertheless, what he does know compels him to
raise the possibility that the remnants of African family structures,
coupled with the legacy of slavery, continue to hurt black Americans.</TE>

<HD>Bankruptcy Debated as Andersen Splinters</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Analysts say firm's deals to sell off parts of
its business are an effort to raise cash to settle claims resulting
from its work for Enron.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An internal debate at accounting firm Andersen over whether to file
for bankruptcy protection took on greater urgency after Tuesday's
plea agreement by the lead auditor on the Enron Corp. account to
cooperate with the government's investigation into the Houston energy
trader.</LD>
<LD>   And there were more signs Tuesday that the firm was splintering
when Andersen said it signed a "memorandum of understanding" to sell
its tax practice in a leveraged buyout to Fox Paine &amp; Co. of Foster
City, Calif. Andersen tax partners will have a piece of the deal,
which would allow them to create a new and separate tax firm. The new
offer appears to compete with a tentative agreement Andersen reached
last week with Deloitte &amp; Touche, but the companies have disclosed
few details.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts saw the two offers as an effort by Andersen to raise
cash that could be used to settle claims resulting from its work for
Enron, whose demise cost thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in
investments.</LD>
<TE>   The firm is taking several actions to conserve cash. It started
layoffs of 7,000 workers this week and has slashed its travel budget
and other expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Partners within the firm, which is seeing daily defections of
large clients, are divided over the bankruptcy issue, according to
individuals within the firm. Some advocate a bankruptcy filing that
could speed an orderly dismantling of the firm and make it easier to
merge their business into new firms without the threat of Enron
liability. Others support a rescue plan by former Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen, which has reestablished the use of the Arthur Andersen
name for its U.S. operations as the Andersen Worldwide confederation
breaks apart overseas, "has no intention" of filing for bankruptcy,
spokesman Patrick Dorton said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because they see time running out on efforts to save the firm,
some partners are actively advocating a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to tell which of the solutions is viable or if
there is a consensus for either one," said an Andersen executive.
"And even if the firm could reach a consensus, you have to ask if
there will be enough time to enact a plan."</TE>
<TE>   Accounting and bankruptcy experts say that when David B. Duncan,
the lead partner on the troubled Enron account, pleaded guilty
Tuesday to a single felony count of obstructing justice by ordering
thousands of Enron records destroyed, the already bleak prospects for
Andersen became grimmer.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's plea and his agreement to cooperate in the government's
case against Andersen and Enron probably killed any chance the
accounting firm had to reach a benign settlement with the Department
of Justice over its obstruction of justice indictment. The trial in
the Andersen indictment is scheduled to start May 6.</TE>
<TE>   "It increases the pressure considerably on Arthur Andersen to
settle the obstruction indictment on the terms the DOJ wants," said
Jacob Frenkel, a former prosecutor who is a white-collar-crime
defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, a person or company that pleads guilty or is convicted
of a felony is prohibited from practice before the Securities and
Exchange Commission and would be barred from conducting public
company audits. They can only be reinstated by the commission after a
special hearing.</TE>
<TE>   That is why the dismissal or suspension of the firm's criminal
indictment is a critical component of Volcker's plan to transform
Andersen into a smaller firm that focuses on auditing and tax
preparation. Volcker needs some sort of agreement that allows
Andersen to avoid the criminal liability that would limit its ability
to practice accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Already, states including Arizona, Connecticut, Florida and Texas
are considering various sanctions against Andersen that would be
aided by a federal guilty plea or conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, I think it is over for Andersen," said Lynn
Turner, former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "For Andersen to survive it needs its customers, its international
practice and its partners, and it is losing all of that," Turner
said.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy filing, he said, would allow the firm to protect its
cash while it arranges for an orderly liquidation in which its
practice groups and offices are sold off for funds to settle its
liabilities arising from its work for the bankrupt Enron. In
negotiations with attorneys for Enron investors, Andersen has
discussed paying $300 million to settle their claims.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's survival effort is complicated by the fluid nature of
the crisis, said Carole Neville, a bankruptcy attorney with
Sonnenschein, Nath and Rosenthal in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Volcker has embarked on what in essence is an out of court
reorganization but has found like others that the problems often
outpace the situation," Neville said. "The problem is that you can't
control all the variables."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Andersen announced it signed a memorandum to transfer
much of its tax practice to Deloitte &amp; Touche. Then Tuesday came word
of the possible sale of the same practice to Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "Arthur Andersen is considering this option as well as the
potential transaction with Deloitte &amp; Touche announced last week,"
Dorton said.</TE>
<TE>   Deloitte declined to comment on the Fox deal, but said in a
statement that it "is continuing with its due diligence under the
terms of the agreement announced last week."</TE>
<TE>   The Deloitte deal would cover half of the tax practice, which has
estimated U.S. revenue of more than $1 billion annually, whereas the
Fox deal may keep the practice together as a single unit.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, fallout from the Enron scandal has cost Andersen more
than 140 of its 2,300 public company clients. Several key businesses
fired Andersen Tuesday, including Walgreen Co., Oracle Corp. and
International Paper Co., which was the only remaining Andersen client
listed in the Dow Jones industrial index.</TE>

<HD>Pittman Put Back in Charge of AOL</HD>
<DH>Media: The dominant Internet service provider has seen
profit erode amid a national advertising slump.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc. removed Barry Schuler as head of its Internet
division Tuesday and temporarily gave the job back to Bob Pittman,
who will attempt to revitalize the unit while also serving as chief
operating officer of the parent company.</LD>
<LD>   The management reshuffling reflects the growing anxiety on Wall
Street about the Internet unit's recent performance and its prospects
for future growth. Analysts called Schuler a victim of the
advertising slump and overly aggressive performance goals, which the
company was unable to meet.</LD>
<LD>   Pittman, who served as AOL's chief executive before Schuler took
the post in January 2001, is widely respected by investors as an
operational wizard who helped turn Dulles, Va.-based AOL into an
Internet powerhouse in the late 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody understands AOL's operations and potential better than Bob
Pittman, and no one is better qualified to manage this business,"
said AOL Time Warner's Richard Parsons in a statement. Parsons, who
will become CEO of the New York-based company next month, declined to
comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons and Pittman approached Schuler a month ago and asked him
to step aside and become head of a new division that will develop
digital services.</TE>
<TE>   Schuler said he was excited about the new assignment and stressed
it didn't result from corporate infighting: "I don't feel victimized.
It's natural evolution. We're putting the right people in the right
places. We have some challenges at AOL. We should apply our best
talent to make things happen."</TE>
<TE>   He said that Pittman's advertising experience would help America
Online emerge from its current slump, while his own passion lies in
designing new products.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who knows me knows that this is what I'm all about," he
said. "I'm a product guy."</TE>
<TE>   The changes are effective immediately, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Schuler's reassignment reflects AOL's disappointing
financial performance and lackluster growth. "When performance lags,
people want action and they want heads," said Bill Whyman, president
of Precursor Group, a technology analyst in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   AOL is the nation's largest Internet service provider with a
comfortable lead over its rivals. AOL has 34 million subscribers
worldwide. No.2 Microsoft's MSN has more than 7 million.</TE>
<TE>   But a national advertising slump has eroded profit at both the AOL
unit and its parent, which relies heavily on the online division for
growth. Advertising and commerce revenue at the AOL unit decreased 7%
in fourth quarter of 2001 to $637 million, down from $686 million a
year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, AOL's market is maturing and
revenue-per-subscriber is flat, despite a rate hike last year and
several new products designed to pump up sales.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Internet unit is key to AOL Time Warner's growth, the
parent company stock has skidded from more than $55 a share last
spring to $21.85 on Tuesday, down 10 cents in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</TE>
<TE>   Putting Pittman in charge sends a message to Wall Street that the
company is taking the problems seriously, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The move may be an antidote to the worries [of investors,] but
these are market challenges that would be hard for anybody to meet,"
said Scott Reamer, general partner of Union Tree Capital, a Denver
hedge fund.</TE>
<TE>   The changes come as AOL Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin prepares
to step down next month, handing the reins to Parsons.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise reassignment of Schuler--a popular, respected figure
among AOL's 16,000 workers--is another blow to morale in Dulles,
which endured 2,400 layoffs last year and watched the company's power
center shift to AOL Time Warner's headquarters after the 2001 merger
with Time Warner.</TE>

<HD>Coke Adds Life to Sales, Profit After Losing Fizz in Late
'90s</HD>
<DH>Outlook for drink company brightens with restructuring and
U.S. economic recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coca-Cola Co. just lost two high-profile contracts, with the National
Football League and United Airlines, to archrival PepsiCo Inc. But
those are small setbacks in Coke's otherwise steady rebound from its
desultory days in the late 1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Coke is growing again, propelled in large part by the recovering
U.S. economy. Its stock, a component of the Dow Jones industrial
average, is again clearing 52-week highs. A management upheaval that
rocked the Atlanta-based giant in recent years has abated, and a
restructuring effort led by Chairman and Chief Executive Douglas Daft
seems to be paying off.</LD>
<LD>   When Coke reports its first-quarter results Tuesday, it's expected
to show a 9% earnings gain from a year earlier, to 38 cents per
diluted share, according to analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call. That's a marked change from recent years, when
Coke's earnings fell for several straight quarters. Coke's global
case shipments are on track to increase 4% to 5% in 2002, double
their level of 1999.</LD>
<TE>   "Coke went through two challenging years, but is now emerging as a
focused, well-managed company again," said John Sicher, publisher of
the industry journal Beverage Digest.</TE>
<TE>   But Coke still faces several hurdles. Simply regaining momentum
for what's already the best-known product in the world--where 11,500
people in 200 countries sip a Coke or another of its beverages every
second--isn't an easy task. In the U.S., sales of soft drinks overall
grow less than 1% a year, well below the inflation rate, and Coke and
PepsiCo are under constant pressure to keep prices down, making it
tough to widen profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   The companies' flagship brands, in fact, lost U.S. market share
last year as Americans kept migrating to juices, sports drinks and
other non-carbonated beverages.</TE>
<TE>   Coke Classic's share of the U.S. soft-drink market slipped to
19.9% from 20.4% the prior year, and Pepsi-Cola dipped to 13.2% from
13.6%, according to Beverage Digest.</TE>
<TE>   Coke still derives the majority of its sales from carbonated soft
drinks, but the company is trying to offset their sluggish growth by
building up its non-soda brands that include Minute Maid, Fruitopia
and Hi-C juices, Powerade sports drinks and Dasani bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its recent gains, Coke's stock still trades at its level
of five years ago. Yet some analysts said the stock's recent rally
has made the shares overpriced--for the time being--because the
company still faces so many challenges. Coke's stock, which rose 35
cents Tuesday to $53.35 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, now
trades for 30 times its expected per-share earnings for 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Citing the pending earnings announcement, Coke spokesman Ben
Deutsch said company officials declined to be interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making good progress, but we're not satisfied yet," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola, which relied on foreign markets for 62% of its
$20.1billion in sales and 76% of its $4-billion profit in 2001, also
faces continued poor economies in many countries.</TE>
<TE>   "With Coke being such a global consumer company, their ability to
execute better is very dependent on economic conditions improving,"
said Patrick Schumann, an analyst with brokerage firm Edward Jones &amp;
Co. in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Coke--once the textbook example of how relentless marketing can
sell the most mundane of products, even sugared water--seems unsure
how best to market its core brands despite spending billions of
dollars in advertising each year. Coke Classic's latest slogan, "Life
Tastes Good," hasn't been in the U.S. market a year, and the company
already is scouring for a new one.</TE>
<TE>   Coke also hasn't had a president in the year since Jack Stahl quit
in a fallout with Daft. So it isn't clear who is Daft's main
successor, although executive vice president Steve Heyer, whom Coke
recruited from AOL Time Warner Inc., is a key player in overhauling
Coke's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the team gets passing marks for carrying out Daft's mandate
that Coke--long known for its insular, top-down management
style--decentralize its operations, repair Coke's frayed relations
with its bottlers and develop new drinks to tackle the plethora of
non-carbonated beverages now on store shelves.</TE>
<TE>   It's "required some major changes, both in attitude and
structure," Sicher said. "He's [Daft] done that. The company is less
Atlanta-centric than it was five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   And despite losing the deals with the NFL and UAL Corp.-owned
United Airlines, Coke is still winning its share of battles in the
cola wars.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Coke signed a seven-year pact to be the exclusive
supplier to 300-theater chain Regal Cinemas Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Coke thrived in the 1980s and '90s under the leadership of Roberto
Goizueta, a master strategist and marketer, until he died in 1997. He
was replaced by M. Douglas Ivester, who encountered one problem after
another during two turbulent years at the helm.</TE>
<TE>   Slumping economies in Asia and other regions eroded sales and
profit. Coke's stock--once so steady that famed billionaire Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. became Coke's largest investor,
with an 8% stake--started tumbling.</TE>
<TE>   The company angered many bottlers by hiking prices for syrup
concentrate. Ivester and Coke also were chastised for poorly handling
a contamination scare involving its soft drinks in Europe in 1999.
That fiasco seemed to illustrate that Coke executives were out of
touch with their far-flung markets.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of the worst crises in the history of Coca-Cola, which
traces its roots back 116 years. That's when Atlanta pharmacist John
Pemberton stirred up a caramel-colored, sugary syrup that, after
being mixed with carbonated water, was sold at local soda fountains
for 5 cents a glass.</TE>
<TE>   Ivester abruptly quit in December 1999. In came Daft, who spent
most of his 30 years at Coke in overseas posts. He promptly slashed
6,000 jobs, or 21% of Coke's work force, to cut costs and jump-start
earnings. And his long-term recovery plan includes pressing for
innovative new drinks and marketing alliances that help Coke peddle
its existing beverages.</TE>
<TE>   Coke was late to the bottled-water market, but now has a strong
seller with Dasani. In the last year, Coke has rolled out new
versions of its Minute Maid juices, and it struck an alliance with
Walt Disney Co. last year to market Disney-branded juice drinks.
Sicher and others expect that Coke will soon unveil a
vanilla-flavored version of Coke in North America to extend its Coke
derivatives beyond such drinks as Diet Coke and Cherry Coke.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Coca-Cola remains a huge profit maker, earning 20
cents for every $1 of sales. But more needs to be done to keep that
profit growing, including "better marketing, better advertising of
their core brands" such as Coke Classic, said Edward Jones' Schumann.
PepsiCo, with its Britney Spears ads, has been stealing most of
Coke's thunder.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, "Doug Daft and his team are doing some of the right
things and going the right direction," Schumann said. "So far, so
good."</TE>

<HD>Company to Pay Fine for Worker Song Swapping</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recording industry announced it had collected $1 million from a
company that let employees swap songs on an internal computer server.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona-based Integrated Information Systems Inc., which ran a
dedicated server permitting employees to access and distribute
thousands of music files over their company computer network, agreed
to pay the Recording Industry Assn. of America $1 million rather than
go to trial.</LD>
<LD>   The trade group, which represents major music companies such as
AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music, Bertelsmann's BMG, Sony Corp.'s
Sony Music, Vivendi Universal and EMI Group, has been on a legal
crusade to stamp out online copyright infringement since successfully
hobbling Napster, the original song-swapping service, with a
preliminary injunction last year.</LD>
<TE>   "This sends a clear message that there are consequences if
companies allow their resources to further copyright infringement,"
said Matt Oppenheim, RIAA vice president, business and legal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA became aware in mid-2001 of an IIS company server
dedicated solely to allowing employees to post and share thousands of
copyrighted MP3 files, which are digitally compressed music files.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA also said it reached a $3.2-million settlement from CD
manufacturing company DOCdata USA to resolve claims the company had
pressed dozens of infringing CDs, including albums by Santana, Toni
Braxton and Destiny's Child.</TE>

<TE>   Clear Channel Accused of Discrimination in Suit</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s entertainment unit is accused
in a government lawsuit of discriminating against diabetic
concert-goers by refusing to let them bring insulin supplies into
venues.</TE>
<TE>   Clear Channel Entertainment, the world's biggest concert promoter
with about 110 locations in the U.S., forces diabetics "to choose
between being barred from concerts or taking unreasonable health
risks," the Justice Department said in announcing the discrimination
suit filed in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses the unit of violating the Americans with
Disabilities Act by creating a policy barring diabetic supplies and
enforcing it against two people in Pennsylvania who tried to take
insulin or blood-testing equipment into a concert.</TE>
<TE>   The suit was filed after settlement negotiations failed, the
Justice Department said.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals with diabetes are entitled to attend and enjoy
community events, like anyone else, without putting their lives at
risk," said Ralph Boyd, assistant U.S. attorney general for civil
rights. The policy "is unnecessary and reflects outdated fears about
individuals with disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Clear Channel Entertainment has a policy prohibiting
patrons from taking syringes into a venue, including needles used for
insulin or lancets for blood-testing. It also doesn't allow diabetics
to take food into a venue.</TE>
<TE>   The suit asks the court to end that policy and award compensatory
damages to those who were barred from concerts. It also seeks civil
penalties for the Justice Department.</TE>

refused to comment.</TE>

<HD>Auditor's Plea a Blow to Andersen, Enron</HD>
<DH>Probe: Duncan's deal hurts the accounting firm's defense
and boosts the Enron investigation, legal analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIANNE HART, ERIC LICHTBLAU and WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Accounting firm Andersen's former lead auditor for Enron Corp.
pleaded guilty Tuesday to felony obstruction of justice, a move that
legal experts predicted would strengthen the government's prosecution
of Andersen and provide critical help in its pursuit of a possible
criminal case against Enron.</LD>
<LD>   The plea by David B. Duncan and his agreement to help the
government's investigations may prove to be a dramatic turn in the
Enron saga because Duncan had access to senior executives at the
company, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   "Career prosecutors would love to have [former Enron Chief
Executive] Ken Lay's head as a trophy, and the only way they are
going to get proof of fraud at Enron is by first getting employees
from Arthur Andersen to 'roll' on Enron executives," said Robert
Rigg, who heads the criminal defense program at Drake University.</LD>
<TE>   Standing before a federal district judge in Houston, a somber
Duncan waived his right to a trial and pleaded guilty to one count of
obstruction of justice for his role in the shredding of documents
related to Andersen's audits of the collapsed energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   Reading from a statement, Duncan said that on Oct. 21, two days
after learning about a Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation of Enron, he instructed Andersen employees to destroy
documents "so that they would be unavailable to the SEC."</TE>
<TE>   "I also personally destroyed such documents," Duncan told U.S.
District Judge Melinda Harmon. "I know they were destroyed" so that
the documents would be "unavailable to the SEC," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the plea agreement, which had been expected since Monday
afternoon, Duncan agreed to be "fully debriefed" by the Justice
Department, to testify at any court hearing as requested by the DOJ,
and to furnish "all documents and other material that may be relevant
to the investigation and that are in the defendant's possession or
control."</TE>
<TE>   In return, the Justice Department agreed to limit criminal charges
against Duncan to one obstruction-of-justice charge. Under federal
guidelines, an obstruction conviction carries a sentence of up to 10
years in prison and a fine of as much as $250,000. Duncan will be
sentenced Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Tuesday, Judge Harmon turned down a motion from Andersen
seeking to quash the Justice Department's use of grand jury subpoenas
in its investigation. Andersen argued that the subpoenas went beyond
the proper scope of the government's probe, but the Justice
Department countered that Andersen was simply seeking to slow down
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, 42, was fired by Andersen in January when the firm accused
him of "unethical behavior, gross errors in judgment or willful
violation of our policies."</TE>
<TE>   As the highest-ranking official at either Andersen or Enron to
agree to help the government, Duncan may have assured himself a
lighter penalty, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, the first guy gets the best deal," said Brian O'Neill,
a partner at O'Neill, Lysaght &amp; Sun in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the documents filed in federal court in Houston, Justice
Department officials refused to discuss their strategy in the cases.</TE>
<TE>   But legal analysts said the guilty plea gives prosecutors
tremendous leverage in their ability to investigate possible criminal
acts by Enron executives and to bring securities fraud and conspiracy
charges if warranted.</TE>
<TE>   Several observers said Duncan, as the partner in charge of the
Enron account, is one of only a handful of top executives privy to
inside details of what took place at Andersen, Enron and the law
firms that handled their business dealings. It's likely he already
has given prosecutors a detailed proffer, explaining what the
government can expect from his future testimony, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The government has indicted Andersen on one count of criminal
obstruction of justice over the shredding and document destruction.
The firm has denied any wrongdoing. A trial is set to start May 6 in
Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan's cooperation deals a severe blow to Andersen's defense,
several experts said, because a company can be found liable for the
criminal acts of its employees.</TE>
<TE>   "The Duncan plea is devastating for Arthur Andersen," said Jacob
Frenkel, a former prosecutor now at Smith Gambrell &amp; Russell in
Washington. "In essence, the government has tightened the noose
around Arthur Andersen."</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Hardin, Andersen's lead criminal-defense attorney, said in a
statement that the firm was "surprised and disappointed by Mr.
Duncan's statement in court."</TE>
<TE>   "It completely contradicts what he has stated up until this
point," Hardin said. "For months, Mr. Duncan has contended that he
had no intent to commit any criminal act."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is trying to reach a settlement with the Justice
Department. Duncan's cooperation with prosecutors puts more pressure
on the firm to resolve the case before trial, several experts said.</TE>
<TE>   If the case goes to trial, Andersen faces a tough decision as to
how to treat Duncan and his testimony. The firm could try to distance
itself from Duncan, portraying him as a rogue employee whose criminal
acts weren't sanctioned by Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   But such defenses often have proven unsuccessful in the past,
experts said. What's more, prosecutors would try to debunk that
argument by pointing to Duncan's 21-year career at the firm and his
high-level role heading up a major account.</TE>
<TE>   The government is certain to use information from Duncan to lean
on other Andersen and Enron employees to provide incriminating
evidence against top Enron executives, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Because Duncan likely dealt regularly with former top Enron
officials such as Jeffrey K. Skilling, its onetime chief executive,
and Andrew S. Fastow, the finance official who was at the center of
many of the murky investment partnerships that helped trigger the
company's collapse last fall, Duncan will help prosecutors piece
together the intent and workings of the complex deals, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan also might be able to contradict statements by Lay and
Skilling that they were unaware of many of the controversial
financial deals and misleading accounting by saying he discussed
sensitive issues with them, some analysts said.</TE>

<HD>Genentech Posts 30% Profit Jump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONI CLARKE</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Genentech Inc. said its first-quarter earnings jumped 30% as
increased demand for its innovative cancer drugs Rituxan and
Herceptin drove a 22% rise in product sales.</LD>
<LD>   Genentech, the world's second-largest biotechnology company, is
spearheading a new approach to cancer treatment in which drugs
interact with specific disease-causing genes or proteins, reducing
the side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy.</LD>
<LD>   Operating profit grew to $118.6million, or 22 cents a share, from
$91.2 million, or 17 cents, in the year-earlier period, matching the
average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   Net income including one-time charges rose to $95.3 million, or 18
cents a share, from $26.75 million, or 5 cents, a year ago, the South
San Francisco company said. Revenue rose 14% to $613.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Genentech's flagship product, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma drug
Rituxan, rose 44% to $247.5 million. The drug accounted for 37% of
Genentech's sales in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of breast cancer drug Herceptin, the company's
second-biggest product, rose 7% to $86.8 million. Genentech in the
fourth quarter of 2001 had shifted to distribution of the drug by
wholesalers instead of direct shipment, causing wholesalers to order
quantities in the fourth quarter sufficient for them to stock
inventory.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech's net income has been held back for the last three years
by an unusual, continuing charge that arose when Roche Holding Ltd.
in 1999 acquired the remaining shares of Genentech that it did not
already own.</TE>
<TE>   Under an obscure accounting rule, when a company that owns a
majority stake in another company subsequently acquires all of it,
the cost of writing off goodwill is recorded by the acquired company.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Roche later sold 42% of Genentech shares, Genentech
has had to write off as much as $100 million a quarter since 1999.
But this year, an unrelated change in accounting rules means
companies no longer need to amortize goodwill--the difference between
a firm's book value and the amount paid for it by an acquirer.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech expects its charges for goodwill to decline by $150
million this year. In the first quarter, the company recorded a
charge of $38.9 million, compared to $81.5million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Genentech closed off $1.80 at $41.05 on the New York
Stock Exchange before the earnings report was released.</TE>

<DH>Telecom: Court filing is important to company's creditors,
who are owed more than $12 billion.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. lost $152 million in the first month after it
filed the nation's fourth-largest bankruptcy, and the fiber-optic
network operator's cash position grew weaker than executives had
stated last month, the company disclosed in a court filing Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Global Crossing's available cash at the end of February was $624
million, according to the Bankruptcy Court report. The amount is $24
million more than the cash on hand at its Jan. 28 filing, but much
less than the $700 million of unrestricted cash that executives had
touted in late February.</LD>
<LD>   Executives would not comment Tuesday on the first detailed, though
unaudited, financial statement the Bermuda-based company has turned
in since filing a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. The company is
required to file monthly financial reports, but officials did not say
when the report for March would be completed.</LD>
<TE>   For creditors, the company's cash holdings are important because
they will help determine how much money is available to fund a
reorganization. Creditors are owed at least $12.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The company is in talks with several suitors, but no proposal has
surfaced, other than a shareholders' bid and a much-criticized deal
with two Asian companies.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has been slashing costs, partly by firing workers,
to halt the rate at which it has been spending its available cash. At
the end of September, it had $2.2 billion in cash on hand, which did
not include certain restricted amounts or the money at subsidiaries
that didn't file for bankruptcy--primarily Asia Global Crossing Ltd.,
which had $434 million on hand at the end of February.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global, which is 59% owned by Global Crossing, is talking
with 19 separate investors in its own effort to get out from under
its parent company, which reneged late last fall on a promise to
provide the unit with $400 million in financing. Executives at the
Beverly Hills-based subsidiary have insisted that the unit can find
the money elsewhere and survive without Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   On a consolidated basis, Global Crossing has $1.1 billion in cash
on hand.</TE>
<TE>   The one-month financial snapshot shows that non-bankrupt
subsidiaries such as Asia Global are hurting as badly as Global
Crossing and its 54 units that are in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Global and those units managed to bring in $226 million in revenue
through February. Expenses, primarily access to and maintenance of
its cable network, left the company with a loss of $78 million. The
expenses included $11 million in legal, accounting, investment
banking and other professional fees for companies hired in February
to help the company reorganize.</TE>
<TE>   Asia Global and other units not in bankruptcy brought in $73
million in revenue and lost $83 million. After certain sales and
expense adjustments that applied to the whole company, consolidated
sales were $269 million; the net loss was $152million.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has yet to file its 2001 fourth-quarter or
full-year financial results, citing ongoing investigations of the
company's accounting and financial reporting practices. A former
executive has alleged that Global swapped capacity on its lines with
that of other fiber-optic network operators and improperly reported
it, effectively boosting revenue artificially.</TE>

<HD>Bill Targets U.S. Firms That Move to Avoid Taxes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) plan
to introduce legislation today to rein in companies that move their
corporate headquarters offshore to avoid U.S. income taxes.</LD>
<LD>   The bill was getting finishing touches Tuesday night, but a Senate
Finance Committee staffer said it would include a provision to bar
the IRS from recognizing so-called corporate inversions when control
of the company primarily remains in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Companies that want to save on taxes by creating a new corporate
headquarters will have to move in fact, not just fiction, if the bill
becomes law.</LD>
<TE>   Grassley is a longtime critic of these fictional moves, saying
that while he supports moving a company when legitimate business
warrants it, some moves are simply unpatriotic paper-shuffling.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no problem with U.S. companies operating in low-tax
countries for legitimate business purposes," Grassley said last
month. "My problem is with companies that set up fictional
headquarters in low-tax countries to escape U.S. taxes. These
fictional headquarters are no more than a folder in a filing
cabinet."</TE>
<TE>   Several companies that have participated in so-called inversions
also are government contractors, Grassley said.</TE>
<TE>   "These corporations are skirting their own taxes, yet profiting
from other people's taxes," Grassley said. "That's wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Grassley previously vowed to bar companies that move for tax
purposes from securing government work.</TE>

<HD>Hilton Hotels Cuts CEO's Pay as Profit Falls</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hilton Hotels Corp. cut President and Chief Executive Stephen F.
Bollenbach's pay 29% to $2.1million last year as the third-largest
hotel company failed to meet profit goals.</LD>
<LD>   Bollenbach, 59, was paid $1 million in salary, $900,000 in a bonus
and $205,245 in other compensation including matching contributions
to a 401(k) plan, the company said in a filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. In 2000 he was paid $2.95 million, including
a $1.8-million bonus, a $921,141 salary and $222,010 in other pay.</LD>
<LD>   Hilton's net income fell 39% in 2001 as the hotel industry
suffered its worst drop in demand in more than three decades because
of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Bollenbach deferred his bonuses for 2000 and 2001 and will receive
them when the company no longer is subject to income tax deduction
limits imposed by the Internal Revenue code, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Beverly Hills-based Hilton rose 4% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The shares closed up 34 cents at $14.69 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Last-Minute Tips to Avoid Costly Tax Mistakes</HD>
<DH>Personal finance: With the filing deadline a few days away,
harried taxpayers should be aware of some common--and some
new--pitfalls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the millions of Americans who wait until the last minute to file
their tax returns, the danger of making careless mistakes--and
overlooking lucrative tax breaks--increases as the April 15 deadline
nears, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   That could be especially true this year, when a new feature on the
standard 1040 tax form--a credit tied to last year's advance income
tax refunds--has been the source of errors on millions of tax
returns.</LD>
<LD>   Last-minute mistakes fall into two categories: overlooked or
misused tax-deductions and credits, and simple errors that could
cause IRS computers to reject a return, generating either an
electronic audit, a delayed refund or both.</LD>
<TE>   Here are a few items to watch out for:</TE>
<TE>   * Advance refund: This credit, related to the one-time refund
checks most taxpayers got last summer because of President Bush's tax
cut, is the one that's causing most of the mistakes on returns this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how it works: If you're a single filer and got a refund
check last year for $300; a head of household and got a $500 refund;
or married, filing jointly and received a $600 check, you have
received the full amount of the so-called rate reduction credit. In
that case, you've already received the credit and you should skip
line 47 on the new 1040 tax form.</TE>
<TE>   If you paid income tax last year but received less than those
amounts, fill out the rate reduction credit worksheet to determine
whether you can claim this credit.</TE>
<TE>   * IRA contributions: Deductible contributions for the 2001 tax
year can be made until April 15. Those not covered by a pension at
work, or who earn less than $33,000 when single or $53,000 when
married, can deduct up to $2,000 in IRA contributions on their 2001
return. Married couples may be able to contribute up to
$4,000--$2,000 a person. (Contribution limits rise for 2002 and
later.) A $2,000 contribution could reduce an individual's federal
tax bill by $550.</TE>
<TE>   * Job-hunting expenses: If you lost your job last year, you may be
able to claim expenses related to searching for work as a
miscellaneous itemized deduction.</TE>
<TE>   Job-hunting expenses--ranging from mileage, postage, resume
preparation fees and even the cost of necessary travel and
lodging--are combined with the cost of other unreimbursed business
expenses, dues, memberships, business subscriptions and tax
preparation fees to determine whether they exceed the miscellaneous
itemized deduction "floor," said Ginita Wall, a San Diego financial
planner.</TE>
<TE>   Expenses that exceed 2% of a taxpayer's adjusted gross
income--income after contributions to retirement and employee benefit
plans, but before other itemized deductions--can be subtracted from
taxable income.</TE>
<TE>   * Mortgage points: The cost of points--upfront interest charges on
a mortgage loan--are fully deductible in the year they are paid on a
loan used to purchase a home. However, on a refinancing, these fees
must be amortized over the life of a loan.</TE>
<TE>   If you refinanced for a second or third time last year, be sure to
deduct any previously undeducted points on this year's tax return.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if you paid $2,000 in refinance points in 1998,
you would have deducted only $133 so far--$66 a year, assuming it was
a 30-year loan. If you refinanced again in 2001, the remaining $1,866
becomes fully deductible. That can save a middle-income taxpayer
about $500.</TE>
<TE>   * Education expenses: Those who returned to school--or paid to
send a child to school--may be able to qualify for one of two
lucrative tax credits. Those financing a freshman or sophomore in
college can claim the Hope tax credit, worth up to $1,500 for those
paying at least $2,000 in college costs. Tax credits reduce your tax
dollar-for-dollar, which makes credits roughly three times as
valuable as simple deductions.</TE>
<TE>   The Lifetime Learning credit is available for those in later years
of college or attending graduate or trade schools. The maximum $1,000
credit can be claimed for those paying at least $5,000 in qualifying
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   But both the Hope tax credit and the Lifetime Learning credit are
income-tested. Anyone earning more than $40,000 if single or $80,000
if married will lose a portion of the break.</TE>
<TE>   * Credits for kids: There are three tax breaks for parents of
dependent children--the child tax credit, the earned-income tax
credit and the dependent care tax credit. Taxpayers have trouble with
these breaks partly because, though they can sound similar, each
defines "qualifying child" somewhat differently.</TE>
<TE>   Theoretically, any parent can claim a child tax credit of up to
$600 a child for dependents under the age of 17. But once again, the
credit is income-tested. Single filers with income of more than
$75,000 and married filers with income exceeding $110,000 will lose
all or part of the break.</TE>
<TE>   The earned-income tax credit is available only to those who earned
less than $32,121 last year. However, the credit amount varies based
on income and the number of qualifying children. (Individuals who
earn less than $10,710 and who don't have children can claim a small
earned-income tax credit.)</TE>
<TE>   For purposes of claiming the EITC, children must be the taxpayers'
dependents under age 19--unless they're full-time students under age
24 or are permanently and totally disabled. The child must reside
with the taxpayer in the United States for more than half of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Dependent care credits are available to those who paid child-care
costs for children younger than 13 so that both parents could work,
look for work or attend school. This credit amounts to 20% to 30% of
child-care expenses of up to $2,400 a child, $4,800 total.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, here are some common errors to avoid when filling out
your return:</TE>
<TE>   * Missing Social Security numbers: Every taxpayer listed on your
return--you, your spouse, your children and other dependent
relatives--must have a Social Security number listed on your return.
If the number is missing or the dependent's name doesn't precisely
match the name recorded in Social Security records, the IRS can deny
personal exemption deductions and all other tax breaks and credits
relating to that dependent.</TE>
<TE>   * Forgotten signatures: Returns aren't considered filed unless
they're signed and dated, but thousands of taxpayers forget. Both
spouses must sign a joint return.</TE>
<TE>   Math errors: These are corrected by IRS computers. But they can
result in underpayments, which can trigger penalties. Check your
figures.</TE>

<HD>Bad Tech News Spreads Worries</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Nasdaq drops 2.4% to its lowest close in five
weeks as dark cloud over earnings discourages investors. Oil prices
are lower.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stock indexes sagged Tuesday as investors braced for more bad
earnings news from technology companies after Monday's surprise
warning from IBM.</LD>
<LD>   But the broader market fared better than key indexes suggested.</LD>
<LD>   A swirl of rumors that Cisco Systems would warn that its quarterly
earnings would miss forecasts shaved more than 8% off its share price
and ignited another sell-off in big-name tech stocks.</LD>
<TE>   "Post-IBM, people are probably a little sensitized," said Jeff Van
Harte, head of equity investments at Transamerica Investment
Management. "Some of these stocks are anticipating a pretty good
rebound in earnings, so I think any time you get more warnings,
people are worried about the valuations."</TE>
<TE>   The tech-laden Nasdaq composite lost 43.30 points, or 2.4%, to
1,742.57, its lowest close in five weeks and another step toward its
2002 low close of--1,716.24 on Feb. 21.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq 100 index, heavily weighted with popular technology
issues, fell even more, losing 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average dropped 40.41 points,
or 0.4%, to 10,208.67, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
lost 0.7% to 1,117.80--its lowest level in more than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Although the major indexes slid, losers led winners by a modest
6-5 margin on Nasdaq, while advancers actually led decliners by the
same margin on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Computer networker Cisco dropped $1.36, or 8.4%, to a five-week
low of $14.82 and ranked as the most active stock on Nasdaq, amid
rumors that it would issue an earnings warning.</TE>
<TE>   A Cisco spokeswoman said the company doesn't comment on rumors.
Analysts said investors may have been selling Cisco because IBM on
Monday indicated overall demand is weak, and because telecom gear
maker Nortel Networks on Tuesday said sales fell more than expected
in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, RBC Capital Markets analyst Sanjiv Wadhwani reduced
his profit estimate Tuesday for Cisco's fiscal fourth quarter, which
ends July 27.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are hungry for further clues on the health of corporate
profits in the tech sector after conflicting outlooks from Compaq
Computer and IBM.</TE>
<TE>   Compaq, the world's No.2 personal computer maker, said Monday it
would meet or top analysts' first-quarter estimates. But Compaq
slipped 31 cents to $9.28, dragged down with the broader market.
Compaq plans to merge with computer maker Hewlett-Packard. Shares of
HP, a Dow component, climbed 29 cents to $17.41.</TE>
<TE>   IBM rose 33 cents to $87.74, after slumping more than 10% on
Monday. IBM blamed soft results on technology spending cutbacks by
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Communications chip makers weakened. Applied Micro Circuits fell
44 cents to $7.50. Other chip stocks also sank, led by Intel, which
dropped $1.47 to $28.46. Software giant Microsoft lost $1.39 to
$32.43.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices, which have surged in past weeks on escalating violence
in the oil-rich Middle East, dipped 72 cents to $25.82 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Gold, meanwhile, fell $1.70 to $298.80 an ounce--its first close
below $300 in almost two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Oil stocks tracked oil prices lower. Exxon Mobil lost 52 cents
to $42.72. ChevronTexaco lost $1.11 to $87.29.</TE>
<TE>   * Eastman Kodak was one of the day's bright spots, and it helped
underpin the Dow. It rose $1.39 to $32.43 on hopes the camera and
film maker is recovering from a demand slump brought on by the weak
economy and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Late Monday, Salomon
Smith Barney upgraded the stock to "outperform" from "neutral."</TE>
<TE>   * The S&amp;P index of 600 small-company stocks rose 0.2% as investors
continued to show interest in smaller stocks. The index is up 6.8%
this year, compared with a loss of 2.6% for the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   * Instinet Group fell 17 cents to $6.83. The electronic stock
trading system, which has been losing market share to rivals, said
Chief Executive Doug Atkin resigned "to pursue other interests."</TE>

<HD>7 Drug Companies Offer Discount Card to Elderly</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Merck spurns trend, expands its own
assistance program.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven major drug companies are offering elderly consumers a discount
card that will let them save on more than 100 brand-name drugs.</LD>
<LD>   The Together RX Card will be offered free to eligible Medicare
enrollees, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Participating in the new card are Abbott Laboratories,
AstraZeneca, Aventis, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline,
Johnson &amp; Johnson Inc. and Novartis.</LD>
<TE>   Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, in a
statement, called the card a "tremendous new initiative."</TE>
<TE>   The companies said the card will offer discounts on more than 145
widely used drugs, including many used to treat asthma, arthritis,
depression, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   There is no charge for the cards, which will be available to
people who lack prescription drug coverage and have incomes of up to
$28,000, or $38,000 for couples.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said discounts will range from 20% to 40% off the
price individuals usually pay.</TE>
<TE>   Enrollment for the Together RX Card begins immediately and the
cards become effective in June, according to the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The companies said other drug firms are welcome to join the group.</TE>
<TE>   Two other major pharmaceutical companies have announced their own
discount cards--Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Merck &amp; Co. on Tuesday spurned the industry trend and said it
would not offer drug cards, but would make its assistance program for
patients without drug coverage more convenient.</TE>
<TE>   Under its long-standing Patient Assistance Program, Merck will
offer home delivery of drugs and will not require patients with
chronic ailments to ask for a new prescription every 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   The program offers many of the company's medicines free of charge
to any patient without prescription drug coverage who has an annual
individual income less than $18,000, or an annual household income
less than $24,000.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare, the federal health insurance program for elderly
Americans, does not cover prescription drug costs.</TE>
<TE>   Although a proposal has been discussed in Washington for years to
include prescription drug coverage, no measure has received
congressional approval.</TE>
<TE>   Merck spokesman Greg Reaves said the company supports a plan that
would create a comprehensive card for seniors to cover medications
from several companies.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Abbott Laboratories posted a first-quarter profit of
$854.3 million, or 54 cents a share, matching analysts' expectations,
as revenue rose 18% to $4.19 billion. The company had lost $223.6
million, or 14 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, when it had
expenses for an acquisition and a litigation settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Abbott also said it expects second-quarter profit of 53 cents a
share, 2 cents less than analysts' average estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares rose 71 cents to $52.66 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Sun Sees Threat in Microsoft .Net</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A Sun Microsystems Inc. executive warned a federal judge Tuesday that
archrival Microsoft Corp. could use its Web-based services strategy
to thwart competition and extend its monopoly power to the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Sun's chief strategy officer, Jonathan Schwartz, said that unless
tougher antitrust restrictions are imposed on Microsoft, it can use
its Windows operating system monopoly and dominant Internet Explorer
Web browser to promote the Web strategy, known as .Net, over
competitors such as Sun's Java programming language.</LD>
<LD>   "The Internet is largely built on open standards, but Microsoft's
control of the ubiquitous operating system, combined with its
ownership of the dominant browser and promotion of .Net Passport,
means that it could lock end users in to a Microsoft-controlled
world," Schwartz said in written testimony to U.S. District Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly.</LD>
<TE>   The judge turned down a Microsoft request that she throw out
Schwartz's testimony about Web services because it was based on
predictions of future Microsoft behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly initially expressed concern about testimony at the
remedy hearings that covers technology not raised in the original
trial. But recently, Kollar-Kotelly has been inclined to allow the
material, with the caution that she may ultimately decide it is not
relevant.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the judge quoted a Supreme Court ruling that "drafting
an antitrust decree involves predictions" in turning down Microsoft's
request.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz was the 13th witness called by nine states seeking
tougher antitrust remedies against Microsoft for illegally
maintaining its Windows monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   The nine states have rejected a proposed settlement of the case
reached between Microsoft and the Justice Department in November.</TE>
<TE>   Sun has accused the world's biggest software company of trying to
sabotage Java. Microsoft, in turn, accuses Sun of promoting the
government antitrust suit as a way to gain a commercial advantage.
Microsoft maintains that Java is a computer product threatened by its
own shortcomings rather than any anti-competitive behavior by
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Microsoft released a statement Tuesday accusing Sun
of trying to slow down the .Net initiative because the company is
"late to the game on Web services."</TE>
<TE>   The states want antitrust sanctions requiring that Microsoft sell
a "modular" version of Windows with add-on "middleware" features that
are removable. They said the requirement would give computer makers a
free hand to customize the machines they sell.</TE>

<HD>Ed McMahon Sues Over Mold in House</HD>
<DH>Courts: Entertainer seeks $20 million from insurer,
alleging he was sickened by substance after botched repair.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN O'NEILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entertainer Ed McMahon is suing his insurance company for more than
$20 million, alleging that he was sickened by toxic mold that spread
through his Beverly Hills house after contractors cleaning up water
damage from a broken pipe botched the job.</LD>
<LD>   McMahon and his wife, Pamela, became ill from the mold, as did
members of their household staff, according to the Los Angeles County
Superior Court suit. The McMahons also blame the mold for the death
of the family dog, Muffin.</LD>
<LD>   Their suit, the latest of many in recent years over toxic mold,
was filed late Monday against American Equity Insurance Co., a pair
of insurance adjusters and several environmental cleanup contractors.
It seeks monetary damages for alleged breach of contract, negligence
and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</LD>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the insurance company declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble began in late July, when a pipe broke in the couple's
six-bedroom Mediterranean-style house, which was filled with
memorabilia from Ed McMahon's long television career. The den was
flooded. A month later, mold was discovered in the den.</TE>
<TE>   The McMahons charge in court papers that they were assured they
were safe and could remain in the house during the cleanup, even as
the mold spread through the heating and air conditioning ducts to
their bedroom. It invaded the closets, contaminating their clothes.
It also was found under the Jacuzzi in the master bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   The McMahons questioned the contractors' cleanup methods,
including simply painting over the mold. As the job became more
expensive and complex, the insurance company and its contractors
abandoned it, the suit charges.</TE>
<TE>   "They covered it until they realized how expensive it was, and
then they covered up," said McMahon lawyer Allan Browne. "What they
did was spread the mold by allowing it to go into the air
conditioning and heating ducts. When they screwed up, they started
saying, 'Maybe we're not responsible for this job.'"</TE>
<TE>   "When your family loses its health and your home is a wasteland,
that's a colossal disaster," McMahon said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The McMahons' 8,000-square-foot house overlooking Coldwater Canyon
stands gutted as the entertainer, his insurance company and the
environmental cleanup contractors argue over who should pay to finish
the cleanup, according to court papers. The McMahons are renting a
$23,000-a-month house and, Browne said, have no idea where their
insurance company has stored their clothing, furniture, artwork and
memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it's safe, but we don't know where it is," Browne
said.</TE>
<TE>   Awareness of toxic mold has increased in recent years because of a
spate of lawsuits. Among the most prominent litigants is Erin
Brockovich, who discovered mold in the house she bought when the
story of her legal crusade on behalf of pollution victims was turned
into a movie starring Julia Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the increased litigation, insurance rates have
spiked in some states. Insurers in some areas have stopped writing
policies or offer only bare-bones ones that don't cover mold
problems.</TE>
<TE>   In June, for example, Farmers Insurance Group lost a $32-million
lawsuit filed by a Texas family that claimed toxic mold in their home
caused severe health problems. The jury found that the insurer failed
to pay for needed repairs for a water leak, which allowed mold to
grow rampant in the house, making it uninhabitable.</TE>
<TE>   In California, Gov. Gray Davis signed the 2001 Toxic Mold
Disclosure Act, which went into effect in January. The law requires
anyone selling, leasing or transferring property to disclose any
potentially dangerous mold problem.</TE>
<TE>   "The mold that grew in this case was the poisonous variety,
stachybotrys chartarum," Browne said. "This is the most dangerous
mold of all. It can cause death in people who are susceptible to
respiratory ailments."</TE>
<TE>   The McMahons' dog, a mutt who resembled a sheep dog, was in
perfect health until she suddenly became sick at about the same time
the mold was discovered, Browne said. "She was a sweetheart of a dog,
incredibly smart, as frisky as you can imagine," the lawyer said.
"All of a sudden she got this terrible respiratory ailment, and they
had to put her down," Browne said.</TE>
<TE>   And then, McMahon's and his wife's health began to suffer.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, best known as the affable sidekick to talk show host
Johnny Carson, spent most of the fall coughing, sneezing and
congested. "Nobody could figure out why he was unable to breathe,"
Browne said. He spent four months on antibiotics and had to cancel
several speaking engagements. Finally, his doctor ordered him out of
the house and his health improved.</TE>

<HD>Saudi's Pledge Takes the Heat Off Oil Prices</HD>
<DH>Energy: Supply threat is not as serious as feared, but Bush
pushes Arctic drilling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The spike in oil prices eased Tuesday after reassuring words from oil
giant Saudi Arabia, but not before lending new political momentum to
the long-debated proposal to open the Alaskan wildlife refuge to
drilling.</LD>
<LD>   World petroleum prices, which have risen sharply as violence in
the Middle East surged, retreated as much as 3.5% in daily trading
after a Saudi official promised that his country would make up for
any shortfall produced by a just-announced Iraqi oil embargo.</LD>
<LD>   The Saudi pledge, and evidence that Israel was beginning to
withdraw from a few Palestinian cities on the West Bank, appeared to
stabilize an oil price disturbance that many economists contend never
was a serious economic threat.</LD>
<TE>   That contention was bolstered Tuesday with the release of American
Petroleum Institute statistics showing a sharp rise in crude and
gasoline inventories, which work to deflate prices.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq notwithstanding, there is plenty of crude in the market.
U.S. stocks remain above the four-year average and gasoline does as
well," said John Kingston, global oil director at Platts, a division
of McGraw-Hill.</TE>
<TE>   But President Bush and other Republicans seized on the perceived
peril to accelerate their efforts to enact a legislative proposal
that would open a small part of the 19-million-acre wilderness to
drilling. Republicans in Congress said they would seek a pro-drilling
amendment this week to the energy bill now nearing a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, a former oil executive, told the Wall Street Journal that
the unstable oil situation "is a reason why I do not believe that
we're out of the economic woods yet" and underscores the need to
drill for oil in the wildlife refuge.</TE>
<TE>   And in a sign that the Middle East crisis may be creating new U.S.
political alignments, a coalition of American Jewish groups,
including the American Jewish Congress and B'nai B'rith, declared
that it now supports the proposal to permit drilling in the
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices have risen by about one-third this year, and the
prospect of higher oil prices driving up inflation worries the
administration. Prices hit $1.413 a gallon Monday for self-serve
regular gasoline; the average gasoline price in California rose 3
cents in the last week to $1.622 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   The increases have come as the market has fretted about an
intensifying Middle East conflict, labor unrest in Venezuela and
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's announcement that he would halt
production for 30 days to protest the Israeli incursion in the West
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi was quoted Tuesday in
Saudi newspapers saying that oil prices should not be linked to
events in the Middle East and that his country--which has by far the
world's biggest oil reserves--would help make up for any losses
caused by Iraq's embargo.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there is no threat to the reliability of worldwide oil
supplies and to the reliability of the Saudi supply in particular,"
Naimi was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   His comments appeared the day after Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
dined in Casablanca with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is
on an urgent peace mission to the Middle East. Oil industry experts
said it is routine for U.S. officials to quietly seek such assurances
during times of price disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries currently
has about 7 million barrels per day of excess capacity, and Saudi
Arabia alone easily could increase production enough to drive prices
into an acceptable range, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Brent crude oil for May delivery fell 3.5% to $26.08 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange in London after the Saudi
minister's comments.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said they were encouraged by his comments and also
by the fact that no oil producers had joined Hussein's embargo.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the public comments that have been made have been quite
reassuring, and based on that, I think it shows that certainly the
OPEC leadership has stayed committed to the position that they aren't
going to use oil as a political weapon," said Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham.</TE>
<TE>   In Berlin, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told reporters that
oil prices are within an acceptable range and aren't likely to
increase more than they have in the last month.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know anything that suggests it's going to go higher,"
O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't the message from pro-drilling Republicans in
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "With each passing hour, the Middle East grows more unstable,"
warned Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska). "And with each passing
day, the U.S. grows more dependent on foreign sources for energy."
The United States now imports about half its oil, compared with about
one-third at the time of the oil embargo in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to weaken Democratic opposition to drilling in the Arctic
refuge, supporters of the drilling touted support from the Jewish
groups, traditionally a key part of the Democratic political base.</TE>
<TE>   The Jewish groups said U.S. foreign policy should not be driven by
Iraq's attempt to use oil as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Brooks, Washington representative of the American Jewish
Congress, said the group supports a comprehensive energy bill that
may include drilling in the Arctic refuge "with environmental
safeguards."</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "We think the most important thing is to pass a
bill," whether or not drilling in the Arctic refuge is included.</TE>
<TE>   The endorsement of Arctic drilling is a reversal for the American
Jewish Congress, which adopted a resolution in January saying the
amount of potential oil from the refuge was "too small to make a
significant impact" on U.S. supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as the Democratic-controlled Senate moved closer to a vote on
the marquee issue in the energy debate, opponents of the drilling
remained confident that they have the votes to block it.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said the Middle East crisis "is
far too complicated to be solved by drilling in the Arctic refuge.
And the fact that we're hearing such a far-flung argument tells me
that those who want to drill don't have the votes. The fact remains
that drilling in the Arctic refuge wouldn't produce a drop of oil for
another 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   Karen Nozik, Washington representative of the Coalition on the
Environment and Jewish Life, an alliance of 29 Jewish organizations,
said the Jewish groups supporting drilling in the Arctic refuge "are
not speaking for everyone. There is a very large constituency that
does not think that drilling in the Arctic refuge is the answer to
our nation's energy security."</TE>

<HD>FCC Asks for Patience on Media Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The nation's top telecommunications regulator cautioned broadcasters
Tuesday not to expect quick action on media ownership limits.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at the National Assn. of Broadcasters' annual convention,
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell said his
main goal was to come up with ownership rules the courts could
accept--something the FCC has failed to do six times in the last five
years.</LD>
<LD>   In the last 18 months, federal appeals panels have forced the FCC
to reexamine limits on the number of TV stations a company can own in
small and mid-size markets, as well as the national caps on station
groups and cable TV systems.</LD>
<TE>   An appeals court also threw out a rule that effectively prevented
cable firms from owning any TV stations in the markets they served.</TE>
<TE>   Powell gave broadcasters few clues to how or when the commission
would rule. Instead, he urged both sides in the debate to give the
commission time to gather the evidence needed to support new rules.</TE>
<TE>   Several large broadcasting and cable firms argue that ownership
limits are antiquated now that consumers can tune in hundreds of
channels and a nearly infinite number of information sources online.
Three of the four largest networks--CBS, NBC and Fox--have withdrawn
from the NAB because they want to lift ownership limits and most of
the group's members don't.</TE>
<TE>   Those smaller broadcasters and many consumer groups say the
restrictions help diversify the viewpoints presented by the country's
most powerful forms of media.</TE>
<TE>   Although diversity isn't a "magical incantation" that
automatically sways the courts, Powell said, "We believe in
diversity. We believe in a diversity of voices. The problem is, what
are the vehicles for fostering that?"</TE>
<TE>   One vehicle, he said, is to count on market forces to deliver
those viewpoints. Many analysts expect the commission, which has
three Republicans and one Democrat, to take a less regulatory and
more market-oriented approach to all its duties, including ownership
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The numerous alternatives to local TV stations "make it rightfully
more difficult to justify intrusive limits" on TV ownership, Powell
said. But he added that such limits weren't out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also urged television broadcasters to offer something more
than "pretty pictures" on their new digital channels in order to stay
competitive. "If you're not creative," Powell warned, "it will be a
challenge to compete with other services that are going to be
offering more flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters have complained that cable, satellite and
consumer-electronics companies all exert control over the shift, yet
none of these groups face FCC mandates. Powell responded last week,
proposing a new set of voluntary deadlines for cable and satellite
operators to carry high-definition or other enhanced digital TV
signals and for set-makers to produce TVs with digital tuners.</TE>
<TE>   The move won plaudits from the NAB, but Powell encouraged
broadcasters Tuesday to do more with their digital airwaves than just
providing HDTV versions of their usual fare.</TE>

<HD>Qwest CEO's 2001 Pay Surges From Year Ago</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc., the subject of an accounting
probe by federal regulators, paid Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio
$27.3million last year, excluding options, more than six times his
compensation in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, the telephone company has lifted a restriction that
prevented 40,000 employees participating in its retirement plans from
selling company stock.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest's shares sank 64% last year as it cut its growth outlook
several times amid slowing sales, weak demand for data services and a
drop in telephone access lines.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Nacchio's 2001 salary rose to $1.17 million, up from about
$855,000 in 2000. His bonus fell to $1.5 million from $2.3 million,
according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</TE>
<TE>   The 52-year-old executive also received $24.4 million under a
long-term incentive plan, 7.25 million stock options and other
compensation such as use of corporate planes. His 2000 long-term
incentive pay was $1.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The 7.25 million stock options would be worth as much as $194
million if Qwest's stock increases 10% a year, the filing said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Nacchio reaped $74.6 million by exercising other stock
options, according to the filing. He wasn't granted options in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The telephone company also said Tuesday that it would no longer
use accounting firm Andersen for consulting services and said it
would review whether to keep the company as its auditors.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Denver-based Qwest fell 20 cents to $7.01 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CVS Corp.'s first-quarter profit fell less than forecast as the
second-largest U.S. drugstore chain sold more general merchandise
such as greeting cards and Easter candy.</LD>
<LD>   Net income was 43 cents a share, 1 cent higher than the forecast
CVS gave last quarter and the average estimate of analysts polled by
Thomson Financial/First Call. CVS earned 54 cents a year earlier. The
company plans to report final results for the period May 8.</LD>
<LD>   Same-store sales rose 10% in the quarter, helped by sales during
the Easter holiday, which came a quarter earlier than last year.
Overall sales rose a better-than-expected 11% to $5.97 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Woonsocket, R.I.,-based CVS rose $1.76 to $35.58 on the

<LD>   GM May Charge Extra for Some Equipment</LD>
<LD>   General Motors Corp. is considering reducing the number of
vehicles that offer safety features such as anti-lock braking systems
as standard equipment, as part of its effort to cut costs.</LD>
<TE>   Anti-lock braking systems, or ABS, are standard on most of GM's
vehicle lineup except the Chevrolet Cavalier, the Pontiac Sunfire and
Saturn vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like a bad deal for the consumer," said Clarence
Ditlow, who heads the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   Ditlow said that not only should features such as ABS be included
as standard equipment for safety reasons, but consumers also would
end up paying more for the devices as optional equipment than they
would if they were part of the sticker price.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lange, GM's executive director for structure and safety
integration, said that about $250 in "safety pricing" has been part
of the cost of GM vehicles, mostly on ABS and adjustable seat-belt
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a balance between how much content is affordable
to consumers, and above that, how much they will pay," he said.</TE>
<TE>   GM shares fell 5 cents to $60.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phillips Petroleum Co., which acquired oil-refiner Tosco Corp. last
year, said it probably had a first-quarter loss as profitability on
making fuel plunged to its lowest level in a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The loss from refining and marketing was "significant," and the
company's loss from operations was "slight," Phillips said. Analysts
had expected a profit of 37 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   Refiners in the U.S., including BP and Exxon Mobil Corp., were
hurt by the rising cost of buying crude oil and by weaker demand for
fuel, analysts said. A mild winter reduced heating-oil use, and a
decline in travel hurt demand for jet fuel.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jacques Nasser, ousted Ford Motor Co. president and chief executive,
was paid $4.9 million for 2001 even though he retired under pressure
in October, according to a proxy statement.</LD>
<LD>   Nasser's pay included $1.75million in salary and nearly $3.1
million in other compensation. He also received options to buy 1.375
million shares of common stock that Ford valued at $12.9 million when
granted.</LD>
<LD>   Nasser is receiving an annual pension of $1.6million to
$1.7million based on his 34 years with the company, a Ford spokesman
said.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000, Nasser made about $12 million, including a $7.7-million
bonus. No executive bonuses were paid in 2001. Nasser was forced to
resign Oct. 29 amid eroding sales, questions about vehicle quality
and the ongoing Firestone tire crisis.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Navy has no interest in two passenger cruise ships that were
being built by Northrop Grumman Corp. for a customer that's operating
under bankruptcy protection, the chief of naval operations told
lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Adm. Vernon Clark said the Navy reached the decision after its
engineers examined one half-built cruise ship that Northrop was
building at its Pascagoula, Miss., shipyard for riverboat operator
American Classic Voyages Co.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop had asked the Navy to consider possible military uses for
the cruise ships.</LD>
<TE>   The company had no immediate comment on Clark's statement.</TE>
<TE>   American Classic had planned to buy two ships from the defense
contractor for $440 million each. But the company filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection in October, leaving Northrop to record a
$60-million charge and restate third-quarter financial results.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Los Angeles-based Northrop fell $1.81 to $114.75 on the
Big Board.</TE>

<HD>Sharper Image Sales Rise 18% in March</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sharper Image Corp. said Tuesday that sales surged in March and that
it forecast a much smaller loss for its fiscal first quarter, lifting
its stock to the highest level in a year and a half.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based retailer, known for high-end gadgets such
as the Turbo Groomer hair trimmer, said sales at stores open at least
one year rose 18% in March on demand for its branded and
private-label products.</LD>
<LD>   The retailer forecast a narrower-than-expected loss in the first
quarter of 4 cents to 8 cents a share, compared with Wall Street's
consensus estimate of 17 cents and a year-earlier loss of 23 cents.
It cited strong sales in February and March and improving profit
margins.</LD>
<TE>   The company's stock soared as high as $21.07, or 17%, in Nasdaq
trading before closing up $2.35, or 13%, at $20.30--its highest level
since September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Thalheimer said business
started picking up late in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, which
ended Jan. 31, after taking a hit during the holiday season because
of the bursting of the "Razor Scooter bubble," which had propped up
2001 sales.</TE>
<TE>   "Our merchandising and product development currently has strong
momentum, which makes us optimistic about our prospects for the
year," Thalheimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Sharper Image, which opened three new stores this month, said it
was on track to achieve its goal of increasing new store unit growth
to 10% to 15% this year. It operates some 100 stores nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The company said total March sales, including those from catalogs
and the Internet, rose 30% to $30 million from $23 million a year
earlier. Total store sales rose 31% to $17.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Catalog sales jumped 35% to $8.5 million. Internet sales,
excluding auction sales, climbed 37%. Including auction sales,
Internet sales increased 18% to $4 million, the company said.</TE>

<HD>Maryland May Block WellPoint Acquisition</HD>
<DH>Insurance: State passes bill requiring cash-only deal for
the planned purchase of nonprofit CareFirst.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WellPoint Health Networks, Inc., one of the nation's largest health
insurers, has become an industry juggernaut thanks to its aggressive
acquisitions strategy. But it may have met its match in the Maryland
state Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   The Maryland General Assembly passed a bill Tuesday that requires
a cash-only deal for the Thousand Oaks-based firm's planned
$1.3-billion purchase of nonprofit CareFirst Blue Cross/Blue Shield,
rather than the cash and stock plan the firm prefers.</LD>
<LD>   The bill also blocks $33 million in planned bonuses for CareFirst
executives, which many Maryland legislators, such as Delegate Bill
Bronrott, called extreme.</LD>
<TE>   There is even a "look-back" provision that allows the legislators
to block the deal for up to 90 days after the state Insurance
Commissioner approves it.</TE>
<TE>   The bill still must be signed by Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very formidable barrier," said health-care industry
expert Peter Boland. "It's a very unusual political move, and I've
not heard of this happening anywhere else before."</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there is enough momentum against the CareFirst deal to
render it practically dead," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst David
Shove said in a research note.</TE>
<TE>   The CareFirst deal would make WellPoint the No. 2 health insurer
in the nation in terms of enrollment and help consolidate its effort
to become a national company. WellPoint indicated that it may have to
rethink the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint spokesman Ken Ferber said the company hadn't had a
chance to study the legislation and would be doing "a careful
evaluation to decide where we go from here." The company stopped
short of saying the bill was an outright deal breaker, adding that
its strategy to acquire or grow in California, Texas, the Midwest,
mid-Atlantic and the Southeast would continue.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland's reaction to the CareFirst acquisition may indicate
growing resistance to for-profit conversions by health insurers, said
analyst Shove, making future purchases of Blue Cross plans more
expensive.</TE>
<TE>   The purchase or consolidation of Blue Cross insurers in other
states had been rather routine until last year, said health analyst
Greg Crawford of Fox Pitt Kelton in San Francisco. But the Kansas
state insurance commissioner blocked Anthem Insurance Cos. from
acquiring that state's Blue Cross insurers, Crawford said, saying it
wasn't good for the state.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland legislators see CareFirst as their constituents' health
insurer of last resort. They weren't shy about admitting they'd like
to see WellPoint's takeover fail.</TE>
<TE>   "Will this break the deal? I certainly hope so," said Delegate
Marilyn Goldwater, chairwomanof the Joint Committee on Health Care
and Delivery Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Goldwater, a Democrat, added that the legislators couldn't kill
the deal. "There's a process that has to be followed, but there is
definitely a lot of outrage over this."</TE>
<TE>   Goldwater said the major concerns were the state's losing its
insurer of last resort, the need to set up a replacement insurer and
the fact that it involves a California company that she said knows
little about her state.</TE>
<TE>   Delegate Shane Pendergrass, a Democrat and the original author of
the bill, said her goal was to block the purchase. The deal "would
turn our nonprofit company into a for-profit built around
stockholders. The decisions would be made three time zones away, and
we were told that efficiencies would be gained in the deal and that
sounds like a loss of Maryland jobs," she said.</TE>
<TE>   CareFirst BlueCross/BlueShield is a not-for-profit managed
health-care company that provides services to more than 3.1 million
enrollees in northern Virginia, Washington, Maryland and Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   WellPoint has more than 12 million enrollees. WellPoint shares
rose 38 cents to $67 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Vintners Cut Prices on Lower Demand</HD>
<DH>Beverages: Competition from imports has prompted consumers
to upgrade, leaving a surplus of cheaper wines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A surplus of many types of wine is pressing the nation's vintners to
cut prices--reversing the trend during the wine boom of the last few
years.</LD>
<LD>   Weaker demand after Sept. 11 and more intense competition from
imported wines has made it harder for wineries to move inventory,
analysts say. Consequently, more wineries are lowering prices,
offering special promotions or rolling out some of their wine in much
larger bottles.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a lot of wine out there to sell right now," said Gladys
Horiuchi, spokeswoman for the Wine Institute, an industry trade group
in San Francisco. "It's highly competitive, so many are having to
compete on price."</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Horiuchi said, the wine market is more competitive than it
has been in a decade, as a strong dollar has made imports cheaper and
helped secure these wines more space on supermarket shelves.</TE>
<TE>   Imports' share of the U.S. market has risen to 22%, up several
points in the last few years and fast approaching the historically
high levels of the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But some imports actually lost ground here, most notably Chilean
and inexpensive French wines, as Australians began making greater
inroads into the market.</TE>
<TE>   California wineries, growing at a rapid clip for most of the
1990s, sold 450 million gallons last year, just 1% more than the
previous year, according to a report by Gomberg Fredrikson &amp;
Associates.</TE>
<TE>   Hardest hit, analysts say, have been wines that sell for between
$3 and $6 a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers have traded up as low-cost imports from Australia have
entered the market, and as more high-quality wines become available
for just under $10.</TE>
<TE>   Canandaigua Wine's popular brand Vendange, for instance, usually
selling for around $5 a bottle, slid to $3 in recent months, said Vic
Motto, senior partner with MKF, which issued sales statistics for the
industry Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   For wines selling under $8, the price of a case slid on average 3%
in 2001, according to MKF.</TE>
<TE>   "There is just more of this stuff out there than people want,"
Motto said.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few bright spots. Wines priced from $8 to $15 posted
sales increases of 13% in 2001, reflecting the number of affluent
baby boomers continuing to trade up.</TE>
<TE>   And wine sales more than $70 held steady as collectors looked to
stock their cellars.</TE>
<TE>   But vintners say premium wines in the $20 to $60 range have been a
harder sell. And more wine bound for restaurants has wound up in
chain stores and discounters.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as fat expense account lunches and fancy dinners were
pared back, and restaurants began scaling back their stocks,
prestigious wine companies--which had been steadily increasing prices
for much of the decade--were forced to curb price increases or begin
offering discounts.</TE>
<TE>   Chalone Wine Group, for instance, is discounting and offering
special promotions for its Echelon brand.</TE>
<TE>   It plans to do the same with its Edna Valley wine from the Central
Coast, popular in restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Wine that restaurants and other retail customers had ordered in
advance must be discounted before it will move, said Chalone Chief
Executive Thomas B. Selfridge.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the biggest discounts for consumers may come in
Chardonnay.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of America's favorite varietal wine flattened for the first
time in years, as more consumers switched to red wines such as
Cabernet, Merlot and Pinot Noir.</TE>
<TE>   Yet because winemakers had been planting more Chardonnay grapes
and turning out more wine, the slowing demand left them with a
surplus, buyers say.</TE>
<TE>   "The market is saturated," said Wilfred Wong, e-commerce cellar
master for liquor chain Beverages &amp; More.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chardonnay peaked, some newer varieties of California
wine, Red Zinfandel and Syrah, saw sales climb in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Syrah sales more than doubled in the last year, as more producers
began planting and turning out this fruity red wine.</TE>
<TE>   Winemakers are planting more of these red varietals to get the
attention of fickle red wine drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of great wine from all over the world out there,"
said Eileen Fredrikson, partner in Gomberg Fredrikson. "Everyone's
got a great Cabernet, Merlot and Chardonnay."</TE>
<TE>   And right now, she said, prices couldn't be better for consumers
to begin trying them.</TE>

<HD>Telecom Shares Hit New Lows Amid Dreary Earnings Outlook</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors who thought they'd seen the lows in the battered
telecommunications sector got a rude wake-up call Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Major telecom shares slumped under the weight of a fresh barrage
of earnings warnings and analysts' estimate cuts.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon Communications (ticker symbol: VZ) slid $1.51 to a 52-week
low of $42.70 after the largest U.S. local phone company said
expenses for acquisitions and the write-down of investments will
reduce first-quarter profit by $2.5billion.</LD>
<TE>   Excluding the write-down for so-called goodwill, Verizon said,
operating earnings also will be lower than expected. It predicted
operating profit of 72 cents a share. Analysts had expected 73 cents.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Verizon said it doesn't expect improvement in revenue
growth in the near term. It wasn't more specific. In January, the
company said it expected sales to rise 3% to 5% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Already reeling from continuing weakness in U.S. capital spending,
Verizon and other phone giants are facing new problems in their Latin
American businesses. Verizon said its write-down was partly for the
reduced value of some investments in Venezuela and Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   BellSouth Corp. also is facing problems in Argentina and
Venezuela, analysts at SoundView Technology said Tuesday. SoundView
trimmed its first-quarter earnings estimate for BellSouth to 56 cents
a share from 58 cents, and its full-year estimate to $2.37 a share
from $2.39, citing economic woes in Argentina and Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   SoundView said subscriber growth at Cingular Wireless, a joint
venture of BellSouth and SBC Communications, also may be weak in the
first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   BellSouth shares (BLS) tumbled $2.33 to $32.05, the lowest since
1998. SBC (SBC) fell $1.63 to $34.90.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, telecom equipment supplier Nortel Networks said that
sales plunged in the first quarter, and that it plans to tap a
$1.75-billion bank line of credit set to expire today to give itself
more financial breathing room. Some of its banks didn't want to
extend or amend the credit line, Nortel said, so it opted to tap it
as is.</TE>
<TE>   Sales fell to about $2.9 billion from $6.18 billion in the
year-ago period as customers pared spending, Nortel said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   But Nortel shares (NT) closed up 6 cents at $3.64, as some
investors apparently thought the news would be worse. The stock is
down 51% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I see out there that's suggesting a turnaround
for telecom," said Paul Wright, an analyst at Loomis Sayles &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Among other major telecom issues, Vodafone Group (VOD) fell $1.28
to $17.09, WorldCom Group slid 63 cents to $5.43 and Sprint FON lost
47 cents to $14.75.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange probably will require its companies to
get approval from shareholders for executive options award plans,
even if the rival Nasdaq market doesn't, Chairman Richard Grasso said
Tuesday. Previously, the Big Board, which along with Nasdaq is
examining changes to its stock-option policies, had said it would
institute shareholder approval rules only if Nasdaq did, to avoid a
potential competitive disadvantage.</TE>

<HD>Xbox May Fall Short of Targets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. may be falling behind on its fiscal-year shipment
targets for the Xbox, according to two Wall Street analysts who cover
the manufacturer of the video-game console.</LD>
<LD>   One of the analysts, Chris Whitmore of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown,
said Tuesday that part of the problem came from weaker than expected
sales of the $299 console at the consumer level.</LD>
<LD>   The Xbox debuted in the U.S. in November, in Japan in February and
in Europe in March. Flextronics International Ltd. manufactures it
for all three regions under a contract analysts have said could be
worth at least $1 billion a year.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said Tuesday that production has slowed, jeopardizing
Microsoft's target of shipping 4.5 million to 6 million units
worldwide by June 30, the end of the software giant's fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   The slowdown also hurts Flextronics, which Whitmore said books
revenue as the video game players leave the production floor.</TE>
<TE>   "Xbox momentum is slowing from an easy start," Banc of America
Securities analyst Paul Fox wrote in a note to clients.</TE>
<TE>   That factor, coupled with trouble with customers in the optical
networking business, could make Flextronics' near-term revenue growth
plans difficult to achieve, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "This time of year is historically a slower time for console and
game sales, so we're watching the market carefully and taking slight
measures to best manage supply," said James Bernard, a spokesman for
Xbox.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard declined to discuss specific numbers, citing Microsoft's
upcoming quarterly earnings report. He said, however, that sales are
expected to track "usual business cycles," and the company is happy
with the console's numbers thus far.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Flextronics shares fell $1.15, to $16.40, while
Microsoft fell $2.35, to $54.87.</TE>

<HD>Company to Pay Fine for Worker Song Swapping</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recording industry announced it had collected $1 million from a
company that let employees swap songs on an internal computer server.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona-based Integrated Information Systems Inc., which ran a
dedicated server permitting employees to access and distribute
thousands of music files over their company computer network, agreed
to pay the Recording Industry Assn. of America $1 million rather than
go to trial.</LD>
<LD>   The trade group, which represents major music companies such as
AOL Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Music, Bertelsmann's BMG, Sony Corp.'s
Sony Music, Vivendi Universal and EMI Group, has been on a legal
crusade to stamp out online copyright infringement since successfully
hobbling Napster, the original song-swapping service, with a
preliminary injunction last year.</LD>
<TE>   "This sends a clear message that there are consequences if
companies allow their resources to further copyright infringement,"
said Matt Oppenheim, RIAA vice president, business and legal affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA became aware in mid-2001 of an IIS company server
dedicated solely to allowing employees to post and share thousands of
copyrighted MP3 files, which are digitally compressed music files.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA also said it reached a $3.2-million settlement from CD
manufacturing company DOCdata USA to resolve claims the company had
pressed dozens of infringing CDs, including albums by Santana, Toni
Braxton and Destiny's Child.</TE>

<HD>Clear Channel Accused of Discrimination in Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clear Channel Communications Inc.'s entertainment unit is accused in
a government lawsuit of discriminating against diabetic concert-goers
by refusing to let them bring insulin supplies into venues.</LD>
<LD>   Clear Channel Entertainment, the world's biggest concert promoter
with about 110 locations in the U.S., forces diabetics "to choose
between being barred from concerts or taking unreasonable health
risks," the Justice Department said in announcing the discrimination
suit filed in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The suit accuses the unit of violating the Americans with
Disabilities Act by creating a policy barring diabetic supplies and
enforcing it against two people in Pennsylvania who tried to take
insulin or blood-testing equipment into a concert.</LD>
<TE>   The suit was filed after settlement negotiations failed, the
Justice Department said.</TE>
<TE>   "Individuals with diabetes are entitled to attend and enjoy
community events, like anyone else, without putting their lives at
risk," said Ralph Boyd, assistant U.S. attorney general for civil
rights. The policy "is unnecessary and reflects outdated fears about
individuals with disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Clear Channel Entertainment has a policy prohibiting
patrons from taking syringes into a venue, including needles used for
insulin or lancets for blood-testing. It also doesn't allow diabetics
to take food into a venue.</TE>
<TE>   The suit asks the court to end that policy and award compensatory
damages to those who were barred from concerts. It also seeks civil
penalties for the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for San Antonio-based Clear Channel Entertainment
refused to comment.</TE>

<HD>Independent Enron Examiner to Be Named</HD>
<DH>Probe: Bankruptcy Court judge's unusual order gives an
investigator broad powers in the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In a rare action, the federal bankruptcy judge in the Enron Corp.
case on Tuesday ordered the hiring of an independent examiner with
sweeping powers to investigate the off-balance-sheet transactions and
accounting irregularities that helped bring down the company.</LD>
<LD>   The order by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez was an acknowledgement that
the case is so complex and so rife with conflict-of-interest
allegations that it requires an outsider without ties to any of the
warring parties, said Alistaire Bambach, a lawyer for the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Under a compromise reached last week among Enron, the SEC and a
Florida state pension plan, Gonzalez stopped short of naming a
trustee to take over management of the crippled firm as well as to
conduct the investigation and any litigation that arises from it.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the examiner will run the inquiry, while corporate
turnaround specialist Stephen F. Cooper continues as Enron's chief
executive. Cooper's employment, at an annual salary of $1.32 million,
was approved Thursday after the SEC and the Florida plan dropped
their objections.</TE>
<TE>   The examiner will be named, perhaps as early as this week, by a
court official, subject to Gonzalez's approval. Parties to the case
will submit names of candidates, said Bambach, a lawyer in the
Manhattan regional office who represents the SEC's enforcement
division in the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   The order gives the examiner 120 days to file a preliminary
report. Bambach said the full investigation probably will take much
longer.</TE>
<TE>   As outlined in Gonzalez's five-page order, the probe will focus on
Enron's controversial "special purpose entities," partnerships
allegedly designed to boost company profits while concealing debt;
transactions that were hedged, or backed up, by Enron stock;
accounting irregularities; and deals under which Enron assets may
have been improperly transferred before the Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Some creditors have alleged that $55 million in retention bonuses
paid out to Enron executives just days before the bankruptcy filing
constituted such a "fraudulent conveyance" of company assets.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez's order requires Enron to provide "all documents and
information that the [examiner] deems relevant" and leaves open the
possibility that the investigation could be expanded.</TE>
<TE>   "That is very broad access to information," said Lynn M. LoPucki,
a UCLA bankruptcy-law professor. Normally, bankruptcy examiners must
obtain specific court orders for information, but this arrangement
allows the examiner to demand material without returning to court.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the order gives the examiner power to waive
attorney-client privilege, meaning that the examiner may request
copies of pre-bankruptcy communications between Enron employees and
their lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to know what advice counsel gave Enron, you can ask,"
Bambach said, adding: "This could subject professionals who advised
Enron to liability."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the attorney-client privilege waiver is reserved for
bankruptcy trustees, not examiners, Bambach said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, through its bankruptcy lawyers, hailed the judge's order.
It "provides creditors, Enron and Enron's shareholders with the best
of all worlds," said Martin J. Bienenstock of Manhattan law firm
Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows the company to be run by Stephen Cooper, the creditors'
choice, without disruption so the reorganization can be completed in
the shortest possible time," Bienenstock added.</TE>
<TE>   The Florida pension plan, which lost $334 million on Enron
investments, and some other creditors had pushed for a trustee,
arguing that members of the official creditors' committee were
reluctant to probe Enron for fear of bringing attention to their own
roles in its collapse.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, for example, both members of the
official creditors' committee, this week were named as defendants
along with seven other banks and securities firms in a massive
lawsuit that accuses the banks of helping Enron to defraud investors
of $25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, former New York City Comptroller Harrison J.
Goldin--who was named examiner last month in a separate, more limited
part of the Enron bankruptcy case--reported finding no evidence that
Enron has improperly transferred money out of Enron North America,
its energy-trading subsidiary, since the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Enron vice president Sherron Watkins, who has
testified that she tried to warn company executives about the
financial threats the firm faced, asked the bankruptcy court to order
the company to pay $235,000 for legal advice she has received.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's former chief executive, also asked
the court for legal fees, although his motion, filed Tuesday night,
does not specify the amount sought.</TE>
<TE>   Skilling, who is represented by the law firm of O'Melveny &amp; Myers,
argued that present and former executives of Enron are the proper
beneficiaries of insurance policies that the company purchased to
protect its officers.</TE>
<TE>   He said appropriate legal fees should be paid for those named in
the policy without regard to their circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Along with former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, Skilling has been
excoriated for having cashed out tens of millions of dollars worth of
Enron stock before the company's collapse.</TE>

<HD>Dosa: A Most Flexible Pancake</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIDYA SHENOI MADIRAJU</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dosa is a hugely versatile food. In India, it can be a light
snack or a meal in itself. It can be made light and lacy or thick and
substantial. It can take a simple five minutes to prepare or a
marathon 24 hours. Its batter can be refrigerated for a week and
still not lose its taste. And it can be made in a hundred different
ways, to suit a hundred different tastes.</LD>
<LD>   All of this I know from personal experience. When I was growing up
in India, we used to have the most marvelous summer vacations at my
grandparents' rambling house. It seemed to me that at any given time
there were a hundred people there--uncles, aunts, cousins, second
cousins, widowed great aunts, neighbors and a stray friend or two.</LD>
<LD>   One of the simplest ways of feeding the tribe was to prepare
gallons of dosa batter, with gallons of sambar and coconut chutney to
go with it. The dosa batter and chutney would be ground in an
oversized version of a stone mortar and pestle. Even simpler was
making a dosa that could be eaten with just homemade hot mango or
bamboo shoot pickles, or with date syrup or honey.</LD>
<TE>   The women of the house would take turns standing over the hot
griddles to keep the dosas coming. The children, once they were done
eating, were recruited to yo-yo between the dining table and the
kitchen with the fresh batches. That we needed urgent refueling for
this arduous task was taken as a given, and a handful of banana chips
or a cream of wheat ladoo did absolute wonders to keep up our
strength.</TE>
<TE>   The secret of the perfect dosa lies primarily in the making of the
batter. The sourdough dosa, which forms the basis for the masala dosa
and is probably the most labor-intensive of dosas, is made with rice
and the legume urad dal (a kind of black lentil). It has to be
blended to the perfect consistency and fermented correctly in order
to get it right. The warm weather in south India speeds up the
fermentation process, but in more temperate climes, it can take up to
12 hours.</TE>
<TE>   It's a good idea to prepare a small amount of batter to begin
with. Make half a batch to start. But even with a perfect batter, the
crispy mile-long masala dosa served in restaurants does take a bit of
practice--and griddle space--to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   But don't worry. You don't need to make it a mile long. It need
not be a perfect circle, and it's allowed to be more than a
millimeter thick--even if you're not cooking for hundreds of hungry
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sada Dosa</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes, plus 12 hours
standing * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup split urad dal</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups long-grain rice</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Oil</TE>
<TE>   Wash the dal and rice separately until the cloudiness in the water
disappears. Soak them separately in tepid water to cover at room
temperature until the dal expands and softens and the rice takes on a
white opaqueness, about 4 hours. Drain and reserve the liquid.</TE>
<TE>   Grind each separately in a blender, using enough of the reserved
liquid to make a smooth consistency. The batter for both should be
very thick, so add as little water as possible. To check the
consistency, take a small amount of batter and rub it between your
index finger and thumb. You should feel no grittiness.</TE>
<TE>   Empty both batters into an oversized bowl (the batter will double
when fermented), using more of the reserved water to wash out the
stubborn bits stuck in the blender. The batter should now be of the
consistency of pancake batter that is neither runny nor lumpy when
dropped. Add the salt and mix thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and place it in a warm
oven (For a gas oven, heat from the pilot light should be enough; for
an electric oven, heat at 225 degrees 5 minutes then turn it off. A
temperature of 85 to 90 degrees is essential to the fermentation
process.). Leave it to ferment overnight (at least 8 hours). South
India feels like an oven most months of the year, so one isn't really
needed there for this purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, remove the bowl from the oven and mix thoroughly
again. It should have doubled in volume and become thick and foamy.
It should also smell slightly sour. The batter is now ready for
frying; it can be covered and refrigerated at this stage if the dosas
are not going to be prepared at once.</TE>
<TE>   Heat a nonstick griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
Lightly oil the surface, seasoning the pan. Blot off any excess oil
with a bunched-up paper towel.</TE>
<TE>   Ladle 1/4 cup of batter into the center of the hot pan or griddle
and immediately, beginning at the center, spread the batter out in a
circular motion, using the bottom of the ladle, until the batter is
spread out thinly. Spoon a little oil around the edges and cook,
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Uncover after about 30 seconds. Small holes should have formed on
the surface of the dosa and its edges should have separated from the
pan. Leave for 30 more seconds before lifting one side gently and
folding it over the other. It should be crisp at this point. To get
it crackly-crisp, add more oil around the edges after spreading the
batter.</TE>
<TE>   Best served immediately with Coconut Chutney and sambar.</TE>

<TE>   Masala Dosa (Stuffed Dosa)</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 50 minutes plus 12 hours
standing * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This, basically, is the Sada Dosa with a potato mixture (bhaji)
spooned into it. The masala is the icing on the cake, as it were, and
lifts the ordinary crepe into something quite special. Having said
this I must admit that I have a preference for the humble sada dosa
because it is pure, simple and wholesome. Of course, the fact that I
once massively binged on masala dosas and suffered its consequences
might be a large part of the reason too.</TE>
<TE>   4 white boiling potatoes, peeled</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chana dal</TE>
<TE>   5 curry leaves</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Sada Dosa</TE>
<TE>   Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, about 20 minutes.
Drain them, reserving the water. Coarsely mash the potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan over medium-high heat. Keep
all the ingredients close at hand. When the oil reaches the smoking
point, add the mustard seeds. These will immediately start to
splutter and pop. Keep a splatter screen handy to fend off any hot
oil burns. When the spluttering eases off, about 5 to 8 seconds,
reduce the heat and add the dal and the curry leaves. Fry a few more
seconds until the dal turns brown.</TE>
<TE>   Add the onions and fry until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Then
add the potatoes, turmeric and salt. Mix well. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons
of the reserved potato water, mix again and cook until the water is
absorbed and the bhaji is fairly dry in texture, 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the Sada Dosa (following the Sada Dosa recipe directions),
and as each dosa is finished, spoon about 2 tablespoons of the bhaji
onto one half of the dosa, then fold the other half over it.
Restaurants often place the bhaji in the center of the dosa and fold
the two sides over it to make it rectangular rather than half moon
shape. Repeat until all the filling is used.</TE>
<TE>   Eat promptly with Coconut Chutney and sambar.</TE>

<TE>   Coconut Chutney</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup water</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon tamarind paste</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups grated unsweetened coconut</TE>
<TE>   1 serrano chile, seeded and minced</TE>

<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon mustard seeds</TE>
<TE>   10 to 15 curry leaves</TE>
<TE>   Place the water and tamarind paste in a small saucepan and simmer
until the paste is softened.</TE>
<TE>   Place the coconut, chile, ginger, chana dal, tamarind paste
mixture and salt in a blender container and puree until smooth, about
5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat to the
smoking point and add the mustard seeds. Cover to avoid any oil
splatters. After the mustard seeds pop, toss in the curry leaves and
cover again, 30 seconds. Remove from the heat and add to the bowl.
Mix thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   The chutney tastes best when eaten on the same day. It can be
refrigerated but not frozen, and has to be brought back to room
temperature and mixed with some warm water before being served. Do
not microwave.</TE>

<TE>   Shallot Sambar</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour *
Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This is a spicy, wholesome stew made with dal and vegetables. In
this version, I use shallots, which lend a slightly sweet taste to
the sambar. You could also use vegetables such as potatoes, onions,
green beans, eggplants, radish, carrots and tomatoes. The sambar is a
mainstay of the South Indian daily diet and is eaten with rice, dosas
or idlis (dumplings). You will need to make a special mix of
spices--sambar powder--for this. The powder is also commercially
produced and available in Indian grocery stores.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup toor dal</TE>
<TE>   2 1/4 cups water, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon tamarind paste</TE>
<TE>   1 cup peeled and quartered shallots</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons Sambar Powder</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds</TE>
<TE>   10 curry leaves</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped cilantro leaves</TE>
<TE>   Wash the dal thoroughly until the water runs clear. In one
saucepan combine the dal, 1 1/2 cups water, the turmeric and 1
teaspoon of oil and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer,
covered, until the dal is soft, about 30 minutes. Mash with a wire
whisk until softened.</TE>
<TE>   In another saucepan, dissolve the tamarind paste in the remaining
3/4 cup water over low heat for several minutes. Add the shallots and
simmer until the shallots are tender, about 15 minutes. Mix into the
cooked dal. Add the sambar powder and salt and simmer over low heat
just until heated through.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a small, shallow
saucepan over high heat until it almost smokes. Add the mustard
seeds. When these start spluttering, add the curry leaves and
immediately empty the mixture into the simmering sambar. Turn off the
heat and garnish with the cilantro. Serve hot.</TE>

<TE>   Quick Onion Dosa</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This is one of the easiest and tastiest versions of the dosa. It's
as close to an instant dosa as you'll ever find.</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup cream of wheat</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup rice flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</TE>
<TE>   1 small onion, minced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced serrano chile</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon minced ginger root, optional</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 cups water</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   Oil</TE>
<TE>   Mix together the flour, cream of wheat, rice flour, cumin, onion,
chile, optional ginger, 1 cup of water and the salt, adding more
water by the 1/4 cup as needed to form a very thin batter.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly spray a nonstick griddle or frying pan with cooking spray
and heat it over medium-high heat. Spread 1/4 cup of batter at a time
thinly on the griddle, working from the center outward, in a circular
motion as described for Sada Dosa. Spoon some oil around the edges
and cover. When the dosa is cooked through and crisp, about 2
minutes, flip it over and fry the other side, 1 minute, adding more
oil as necessary. Serve hot with Coconut Chutney.</TE>
<TE>   10 dosas. Each dosa: 83 calories; 296 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol; 3

<TE>   1 teaspoon toor dal</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cumin seeds</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>

<TE>   1/4 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 dried red chiles</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon asafetida</TE>
<TE>   Place the chana dal, urad dal, toor dal and cumin seeds in a small
skillet and toast over medium-high heat until the dals turn a few
shades darker and release their aroma, about 2 minutes. Cool to room
temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a skillet over low heat and add the coriander
seeds, fenugreek seeds, chiles and asafetida. Stir constantly until
the spices release their aromas and turn brown, 1 minute. Turn off
the heat and cool to room temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Grind the spices and dals to a coarse powder and store in an
airtight, clean and dry jar away from direct light and heat. This
mixture should keep its potency for at least 6 months.</TE>

<TE>   Coconut Dosa</TE>
<TE>   Active and Total Preparation Time: 30 minutes plus 4 hours
standing * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This is a specialty of the Konkan region along India's west coast
and one of my favorites. It can be eaten with store-bought hot
pickles, honey or date palm sugar syrup. Or you could pair it up with
a curry or stew in place of bread or rice. The batter can be covered
and refrigerated for a week. Bring to room temperature, add a few
tablespoons of warm water and mix well before frying the dosas.</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 cups long-grain rice, washed well and soaked in cold water
at least 4 hours</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup grated unsweetened coconut</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Nonstick cooking spray</TE>
<TE>   Oil</TE>
<TE>   Drain the rice and reserve the water. Place the rice, coconut and
salt in a blender with 1/2 cup of the reserved water and blend to a
fairly smooth consistency of heavy cream, adding up to 1 3/4 cups
water to achieve the right consistency. The batter should feel a
little gritty.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly spray a nonstick griddle or frying pan with nonstick spray
and heat it over medium-high heat. Mix the batter thoroughly and pour
about 1/4 cup onto the hot surface. The batter should be thin enough
to spread on its own. If it is too thick add a little water before
making the next dosa. This is an irregularly shaped dosa. To make the
shape more regular, fill in the irregularities with more batter.
Spoon some oil on the edges and cover. Cook for 1 minute. Check it
for doneness. Fold the dosa and serve immediately.</TE>
<TE>   10 dosas. Each dosa: 187 calories; 242 mg sodium; 0 cholesterol;
11 grams fat; 7 grams saturated fat; 21 grams carbohydrates; 2 grams
protein; 0.65 gram fiber.</TE>

<LD>Making dosas can be frustrating at first. It's a technique that must
be learned, just like any other. Here are some tips to help you along
the way:</LD>
<LD>   * Some of the ingredients may be difficult to find at your
neighborhood supermarket, but they're readily available at any Indian
market. While you're there, it's a good idea to shop for spices too.
The prices will be much lower and the quality better than at most
other places.</LD>
<LD>   * The rice and the dal can be ground together, but the result is
better if they are worked separately.</LD>
<TE>   * When you rub the prepared batter between your fingers, the
ground rice should be very fine, no thicker than granulated sugar.</TE>
<TE>   * To ferment the batter, try leaving it in the oven overnight,
covered. If it is a gas oven, the heat from the pilot light will
probably be enough. For electric, turn the oven on to 225 degrees for
five minutes, then turn it off.</TE>
<TE>   * To make sure that it is fermenting well, check on it a couple of
times in the 8- to 12-hour period. You should be able to see a rise
in its volume, and it should also start smelling slightly sour.
Ideally, when ready, the fermented dosa batter should have almost
doubled in volume and become thick and foamy.</TE>
<TE>   * If after 4 to 5 hours you do not see much fermentation in the
batter, sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of salt on the surface and return it to
the oven.</TE>
<TE>   * The final batter should be fairly thin, the consistency of
cream.</TE>
<TE>   * The best tool for cooking is a well-seasoned cast-iron griddle.
Failing that, any heavy pan will work. Nonstick pans are fine, if
they are heavy enough.</TE>
<TE>   * Heat the griddle over medium-high heat. The batter should begin
to cook as soon as it touches the pan, but if the griddle is too hot,
the batter may clump.</TE>
<TE>   * To prepare the griddle for the dosa, rub the surface with an
oiled paper towel. There should be no perceptible traces of oil in
the pan, just a darkening of the surface.</TE>
<TE>   * Once you've poured the batter onto the griddle, work quickly.
Use the back of a ladle and very lightly but evenly smear the batter
in circles, spreading it outward as thin as possible. Imagine that
you are drawing a spiral beginning with a point at the center of the
griddle. Too light a pressure on the ladle will result in a thicker
dosa. Practice is the mantra.</TE>
<TE>   * A round ladle makes the dosa start out thicker in the center and
thin out on the edges. A flat-bottomed ladle will make dosas that are
thinner and more even. In India, a katori or small, flat-bottomed
brass bowl is also used with great dexterity for this purpose. (These
are available in Indian stores.)</TE>
<TE>   * Once you start spreading the dosa batter with the ladle, move in
a continuous circular motion and do not lift away the ladle until all
of the batter has been spread.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't go back over the batter to fill in holes, they're a
natural part of most dosas.</TE>
<TE>   * Most cooks don't cover their dosas when cooking. But this trick,
demonstrated to me by my mother, speeds up the cooking and makes the
dosa easier to remove from the pan without the necessity of adding
more oil and without losing the crispness.</TE>

<HD>Chicken Feed Diet</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a lot of people know, pigs destined to be Smithfield hams are
supposed to be fed on peanuts. Farmers have also designed special
diets to improve the flavor of chickens. One of the oldest was the
favorite of the Persian court a millennium and a half ago: hemp
seeds. (The same medieval Persian gourmets also advised chasing
chickens around to tire them out in the belief that this would make
their flesh more tender, though it would actually stimulate enzymes
having the opposite effect.)</LD>
<LD>   One 17th century English cookbook, "The Closet of the Eminently
Learned Sir Kenelme Digbie," gave no fewer than nine recipes for
fattening chickens. The main idea was to feed them barley meal mixed
with milk and sugar to "scour" their intestines, which was believed
to make the flesh sweet and "exceeding white." After that you might
give them chopped raisins. "The less drink they have, the better it
is, for it washeth away their fat," Sir Kenelme warned, but you could
give them leftover beer.</LD>
<TE>   Just to make sure they were well scoured, he reported, some people
would mingle the barley paste with "a little (about an eighth part)
of powder of green glass beaten exceedingly small." Well, chickens
swallow pebbles all the time, so maybe this wouldn't hurt them, but
he did add, "When you eat them, you will find some of the powder of
glass in their stomacks, i.e. gizzards." Some chicken owners
preferred using brick dust rather than ground glass, possibly to
avoid seeing the tiny green speckles glinting on their plates.</TE>
<TE>   To have really fat chickens, he wrote, you should feed them
raisins beaten to a pulp, soaked with milk and thickened with bread
crumbs: "The delight of this [food] will make them eat continually,"
he claimed, "and they will be so fat ... that they will not be able
to stand, but lie down upon their bellies to eat."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can drown a fish filet in a heavy sauce or fry it in too much
fat. Or you can combine the mild flavors of yellow tomatoes and
yellow bell peppers for a light coulis that does not overpower the
delicate flavor of sole.</LD>
<LD>   The sole is fried in nonstick cooking spray and just a bit of
butter for flavor. Petrale sole is a member of the flounder family
and has a firmness that makes it easy to fry without falling apart
during cooking and turning.</LD>
<LD>   Look for cans of golden plum tomatoes alongside regular canned
tomatoes at the grocery store.</LD>

<HD>A Life With Lettuce: One Farmer's Long, Strange Trip</HD>

<LD>Dennis Peitso, the owner of Maggie's Farm in Agoura Hills, may be the
only farmer who commutes to work from a boat in Marina del Rey. He
has shaggy brown hair, an amiable laugh and the laid-back manner of
an old hippie.</LD>
<LD>   As he tells it, he followed a twisty path to farming. Raised on a
Minnesota dairy farm, he served four tours in Vietnam. After
wandering the world, getting married and divorced and earning a
degree in Chinese language and culture, he ended up in the 1970s
doing construction work in Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   There he met his second wife, Andrea Crawford, and they started
growing mesclun, the traditional Provencal mix of spicy greens
including lettuces, frisee, arugula, mustard greens and cress, for
Chez Panisse restaurant. At that time mesclun was rare in America,
and they were so successful they started growing other items that
chefs couldn't get elsewhere, such as mache and radicchio.</LD>
<TE>   In 1984, at the urging of chef Wolfgang Puck, Peitso and Crawford
moved south to set up a similar operation in a Venice backyard to
supply L.A. restaurants. It flourished and they eventually sold the
Berkeley business. As their production increased, they moved to
properties in Tarzana and Agoura Hills, which they called Kenter
Canyon Farms, and started selling at farmers markets.</TE>
<TE>   After the couple separated in 1988 and split the business, Dennis
renamed his share Maggie's Farm, after the Bob Dylan song. (At one
point he planned to set up a grocery store in Santa Monica as part of
a venture with Dylan, a friend of a friend, but it didn't happen.)</TE>
<TE>   Sandwiched between new horse ranchos and the sage and scrub
oak-covered hills of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation
Area, the Agoura farm is still a work in progress. Arriving at the
property early enough in the morning that it is still foggy and
chilly, Peitso directs his foreman, Ramiro Navarro, in laying new
irrigation pipe, while other workers laboriously hand-weed a patch of
baby lettuce. "It's insanely expensive to pull them by hand," says
Peitso, "but that's the only way we can do it organically."</TE>
<TE>   As a jackrabbit hops by, he says: "They eat tons, the deer too. We
deal with it by planting enough for everybody." Mountain lions
occasionally skulk around the area, too, he says, and when they do,
the workers have to wait to turn on the irrigation valves.</TE>
<TE>   Later he stops by his Tarzana farm, a long narrow strip of seven
acres underneath power lines. The land is bordered by houses,
including the former hunting cottage of Edgar Rice Burroughs (the
author of "Tarzan," the community's namesake), but homes can't be
built directly beneath the power lines. Thus, notes Peitso, "urban
agriculture has a chance to flourish."</TE>
<TE>   At the bottom of the hill, two workers bend close to the ground to
snip off baby arugula and spinach, then carefully wash the greens in
a nearby shed. At the top of the property, Peitso clips intensely
aromatic Mexican oregano and tweaks off tiny red flowers of pineapple
sage, which provide an exquisite tinge of pineapple flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why has he stayed small while many of his competitors have
gone commercial, he says simply: "Quality versus quantity."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maggie's Farm sells at these farmers markets: Santa Monica
(Arizona Avenue and 2nd Street), Wednesdays 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and
Saturdays 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Westwood (Weyburn Avenue at Westwood
Boulevard), Thursdays 1 to 7 p.m.; Venice (Venice Boulevard at Venice

<HD>Black-Tie Pot Pies</HD>
<DH>Here's what happens when three Southern California chefs
dress up an American classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The words "pot pie" on a menu appeal to the traditionalist in all of
us, evoking images of Grandma's apron and the steamy comfort of a
warm kitchen. So what if the pie turns out to be like nothing Grandma
ever dreamed of?</LD>
<LD>   In Dana Point, at the luxurious new St. Regis at Monarch Beach
Hotel's Aqua restaurant, Chris L'Hommedieu makes pot pie stuffed with
chunks of lobster and baby vegetables lightly bound in a cream sauce.
It is served tableside, the waiter carefully lifting off the crust
intact and spooning out the filling.</LD>
<LD>   At the House, Scooter Kanfer's spunky little place on Melrose,
there's no pastry lid at all. There's no meat, either. Even the
fairly traditional pot pie Patrick Healy makes at Buffalo Club in
Santa Monica is based on a homemade chicken stock reduced to a glaze
and spiked with wild mushrooms.</LD>
<TE>   Clearly, this humble dish has been dressed up in ways Grandma
never imagined. Yet all three chefs credit their grandmothers with
their first pot pie experience.</TE>
<TE>   Kanfer says her New Yorker grandma called her dish pot pie, even
though it was made with a mashed potato topping, which purists might
consider more of a shepherd's pie.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a Hungarian Jewish home in Queens, and I was one of
those weird kids who didn't even have store-bought bread until I went
to boarding school, because my nana made a loaf of fresh bread every
morning," she says. "For her pie, she would take a little leftover
goulash and put a layer of mashed potatoes on top of that and bake
it. I loved that. To me, that's the ultimate comfort food."</TE>
<TE>   L'Hommedieu ate pot pies at his grandma's table in New England. "I
remember she used to bake them in an oval casserole dish. She'd boil
the chicken up in the morning, then flake it into the pot with
carrots, potatoes and creamed peas. Then she'd bake it in the oven
with a flaky pie dough. A lot of things I do in the restaurant, I
picked up from her."</TE>
<TE>   Grandma might not recognize the tableside lobster preparation, but
she'd still feel safe ordering it, L'Hommedieu says. "I think that's
the one dish on the menu that, if one of my family members came in,
that's what I'd send them. I come from a pretty humble background,
and most of my family doesn't have much experience in this kind of
restaurant. But this dish touches on the comfort zone for most people
while still being pretty sophisticated."</TE>
<TE>   Healy's family was very sophisticated about food. His grandmother
was a high-society cooking teacher in Palm Beach, Fla., and counted
Julia Child and her sister Dort among her students, as well as Jackie
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother used to do a pot pie with pheasant," he says. "At
home she used a puff pastry crust and served it in a beautiful old
earthenware dish. She did things very French. That was my first
chicken pot pie and still probably one of the best pot pies I've ever
had."</TE>
<TE>   You can rail about the evils of meddling with tradition if you
want, but in reality, these modern improvisations are perfectly in
keeping with the historical spirit of the dish.</TE>
<TE>   There is no single definition of a pot pie, and there never has
been one. Meat pies go back to time immemorial. As long as food has
been written about, there seems to have been some kind of main dish
being served in a crust somewhere. In fact, until the 17th century,
nearly all pies were filled with meat.</TE>
<TE>   In early America, with its colonial culinary roots in England, the
meat pie was particularly important. In Amelia Simmons' "American
Cookery," published in 1796 and credited as this country's first
cookbook, she mentions savory pies made of chicken and "stew," as
well as a "sea pie" made with meat and salt pork. Mince pie, today
regarded as an antique dessert, actually began as a main dish.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of its ubiquity, the pot pie has resisted
uniformity. In addition to having wildly different fillings, there is
similar disagreement as to topping. Crusts are made with flaky pie
pastry, puff pastry and biscuit dough. In the first edition of "The
Joy of Cooking," the chicken pot pie is topped with a batter, more
like what we would consider a dumpling.</TE>
<TE>   Even Kanfer's seemingly radical topless pie isn't all that weird.
In Pennsylvania Dutch country, pot pie is a chicken stew served with
broad noodles. Who knows? Someone may even have made a vegetarian
version once.</TE>
<TE>   Even with something as homey as pot pie, careful preparation is
required. For the Aqua pie, that starts with exact cooking of the
lobster. "All the love goes in before the pie is baked," says
L'Hommedieu. "That's making the sauce and precooking the lobster.</TE>
<TE>   "Lobster is temperamental. You don't want it undercooked or
overcooked. We precook the lobster before assembling the pot pie. You
want a three-minute lobster. You want to cook the tail and the claws
so you can get all the meat out.</TE>
<TE>   "You also want to make sure all the vegetables are tender but not
messy. Everybody puts their twists on this recipe. Down here, I have
a particular farm I work with for my produce and I want to show that
off, so I get baby vegetables and cook them just tender.</TE>
<TE>   "For the sauce, I sweat lobster bodies with a little chopped
vegetables, a little white wine, a little brandy and some cream. Cook
those for 20 to 30 minutes to infuse the flavors. Some people use
roux-based sauce. I don't like that as much as thickening the sauce
with pureed vegetables. You get a natural flavor and it's as stable
as roux is."</TE>
<TE>   Healy uses a roux for his sauce, but only after a lot of cooking
has already gone into it. "The sauce that's served with this is very
rich," he says. "It's made from a deep chicken stock reduction that
turns into glaze and I add cream to it."</TE>
<TE>   The chicken has to be cooked just right as well. "I tried serving
it with dark meat and with white meat and I found that most people
like white meat, though that's not necessarily my preference. And
like any recipe with white meat chicken, there's a fine line between
when it is tender and moist and cooked through and when it starts
going to the stew stage, where it will be dry, and you'll have to
keep cooking it until it is falling-off-the-bone tender. Always cut a
little piece off and give it a taste test. That's the way we do it in
the restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   The biscuit dough, which he prefers as a topping because of the
way its hearty texture matches the sauce, has to be handled lightly,
too, or it will become tough. It's much better made the same day it's
baked, Healy says. "You get a much better rise. It's lively and
light."</TE>
<TE>   Kanfer's pot pies aren't so much an example of perfecting
technique as of rethinking the form. They are whimsical and change
with the seasons. First, there's some kind of roasted vegetable
container--anything from a winter squash or spring onion to a summer
tomato. Then she puts in a protein base--lentils or grain to keep the
dish vegetarian. On top of that goes a mix of seasonal
vegetables--some blanched, some roasted, some grilled, for a variety
of flavors and textures--bound with a vegetable puree.</TE>
<TE>   "I call it a pot pie because it comes in a vessel," she says. "I
think it's fun to give people something a little familiar, then give
them a twist on it."</TE>

<TE>   Lobster Pot Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 1  1/2 hours * Total Preparation Time: 3 hours</TE>
<TE>   This is a signature dish at all of the Aqua restaurants. It was
developed by Michael Mina. At the St. Regis, Chris L'Hommedieu
substitutes turnips and baby beets for zucchini during the winter
months. Truffle butter and truffle oil are available at specialty and
gourmet markets.</TE>
<TE>   LOBSTER</TE>
<TE>   2 (1 1/2-pound) lobsters</TE>
<TE>   Kill the lobsters by making a cut just behind the head. Remove the
claws and tails. Put the tails and claws in a large bowl and cover
with boiling water. Blanch the claws for 21/2 minutes and the tails
for 3 minutes. Remove them from the boiling water and shock them in
ice water until chilled. (These can be cooked ahead of time, then
brought to room temperature when ready to use.)</TE>
<TE>   Remove the meat from the tails and cut on the bias into 3 or 4
medallions. Remove the meat from the claws and knuckle and set aside.
Clean the body shells, removing the innards and scraping the gills.
Reserve the shells to make stock for the cream sauce.</TE>
<TE>   VEGETABLES</TE>
<TE>   2 carrots, cut on the diagonal into</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   2 zucchini, cut in half lengthwise, then into 1 1/2-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   6 small boiling potatoes, cut in half</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup cipolline onions or pearl onions</TE>
<TE>   1 cup chicken broth or water</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound oyster mushrooms</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Blanch the carrots, zucchini, potatoes and onions in boiling water
until they are almost tender; do not cook them all the way because
they will finish cooking in the pie when it is baked. The carrots
will need 6 to 8 minutes, the zucchini 2 to 3 minutes, the potatoes
about 8 minutes, the onions 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Peel the onions and place them in a small skillet with the broth
or water and the sugar. Cook over medium heat until the liquid is
reduced and the onions are tender and start to brown from the sugar
caramelizing, 10 to 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, lightly sear the mushrooms in the butter in a small
skillet over high heat until they begin to color, 2 to 3 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper and add to the onions. Add the carrots,
zucchini and potatoes and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   PIE DOUGH</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter, slightly chilled, cut in small chunks</TE>
<TE>   Dash salt</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons ice water</TE>
<TE>   Sift the flour into the bowl of a mixer. With the mixer on low
speed, drop the butter into the flour, a few chunks at a time. Season
the mixture with salt. Add the water slowly just until dough forms;
do not overmix. Shape the dough into 2 disks and refrigerate for 1
hour.</TE>
<TE>   TRUFFLE MUSHROOM CREAM</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons truffle butter or 1/4 teaspoon truffle oil</TE>
<TE>   Lobster shells</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon vegetable oil</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, sliced</TE>
<TE>   5 tablespoons tomato paste</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup brandy</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   3 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   10 shallots, sliced</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon white peppercorns</TE>
<TE>   Place the flour in a saucepan and whisk in the truffle butter over
medium heat to make a roux, cooking until the raw flour taste is gone
and the mixture smells nutty, about 6 to 7 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Sear the lobster shell pieces in the vegetable oil in a skillet
over high heat until they turn red, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onions,
reduce the heat to medium and cook until tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add
the tomato paste and cook 5 minutes. Add the brandy and wine to the
pan and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until no liquid remains
in the pan. Add the cream, shallots, bay leaf, coriander seeds and
peppercorns. Bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid is reduced
by half, 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Strain the mixture, discarding the solids, and place the liquid in
a saucepan. Whisk in the truffle roux and cook over medium-high heat
until the mixture thickens, about 2 to 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1 cup spinach, cooked and chopped</TE>
<TE>   Vegetables</TE>
<TE>   Lobster</TE>
<TE>   Truffle Mushroom Cream</TE>
<TE>   Pie Dough</TE>
<TE>   1 egg, beaten</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 375 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   To assemble, divide the spinach in half and arrange it on the
bottom of 2 (3-cup to 1-quart) baking dishes. Divide the reserved
vegetables and add to the dishes. Arrange the lobster on top of the
vegetables by crossing the claws over the tail. Divide the Truffle
Mushroom Cream Sauce and pour over the vegetables and lobster.</TE>
<TE>   Roll the pie dough out so it is slightly thicker than 1/8 inch and
place it on top of each dish. Trim the dough so that it is about 1/2
inch wider than the dish and seal or flute the edges. Brush the tops
with the beaten egg and cut 2 to 3 slits in the top of each pie.</TE>
<TE>   Bake the pies until heated through and the tops are browned, 45 to
50 minutes. Serve immediately.</TE>

<TE>   Farmers Market Pot Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 1  1/2 hours * Total Preparation Time: 2  1/2
hours * Vegetarian</TE>
<TE>   This is one way Scooter Kanfer makes pot pies at the House. The
recipe will change with the seasons, though, and many different
vegetables are used.</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   1 cup French green lentils</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   4 (1-pound) acorn squash</TE>
<TE>   Olive oil or grapeseed oil</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   4 cups assorted vegetables, such as baby yellow beets, asparagus,
broccoli crowns, cut into bite-sized pieces</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Combine 2 cups of water, the lentils and 1 teaspoon of salt in a
saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer the lentils
until tender but slightly firm, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cut the tops off each squash and remove the seeds and
pulp. Rub the inside and outside of the squash with oil and season
with salt and pepper. Set the squash in a baking dish and bake until
just tender, 40 minutes. Remove the squash from the oven and keep
warm.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cook the vegetables by blanching, roasting, steaming or
sauteing (how you cook them will depend on what vegetables you have
and how much time you have). Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   HERB AU JUS</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 onions, diced</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   2 bay leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   1 cup red wine</TE>
<TE>   6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   6 cups vegetable stock</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup minced parsley</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook the
onions, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves and salt until the onions are
soft and browned, about 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the wine and garlic and reduce the liquid by one-half. Add the
flour slowly, and cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Add the stock, bring to a
boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the liquid is reduced by
one-fourth, about 25 to 30 minutes. Add the parsley.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   1 large head garlic</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 cups assorted mushrooms, such as shiitake and baby portabellos</TE>
<TE>   Cooked lentils</TE>
<TE>   Herb au Jus, divided</TE>
<TE>   Cooked vegetables</TE>
<TE>   Cooked squash</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut off the top one-fourth of the
garlic and place the head on a piece of foil. Drizzle with 1
tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Seal the
foil and roast the garlic 30 minutes. When the head is cool enough to
handle, squeeze the garlic from the cloves, cut into small pieces and
set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the assorted mushrooms in the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil
in a skillet over medium heat until softened, 5 minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Combine the cooked lentils with 2 cups of the Herb au Jus and the
roasted garlic in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat, covered, until
the lentils have absorbed most of the liquid and are tender, 10
minutes. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Place each squash in the center of a serving plate or bowl and
fill each with the lentils then the vegetables. For the sauce,
combine the remaining Herb au Jus and the cooked mushrooms and heat
in a saucepan until warmed through. Season to taste with salt and
pepper. Drizzle the sauce over and around the squash.</TE>

<TE>   Colonial Chicken Pot Pie With Buttermilk Biscuit Crust</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 2 hours * Total Preparation Time: 3 hours</TE>
<TE>   This recipe by Buffalo Club's Patrick Healy makes enough pot pie
for a crowd. If you're serving a smaller group, it can be cut in
half.</TE>
<TE>   BISCUIT CRUST</TE>
<TE>   3 1/2 cups plus 1 tablespoon flour, plus more for rolling</TE>
<TE>   3 teaspoons baking powder</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon baking soda</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups buttermilk</TE>
<TE>   Place the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda and butter in
the bowl of a mixer and mix on low speed until it reaches a sand-like
texture.</TE>
<TE>   Add the buttermilk slowly while mixing. Do not overwork. Form into
2 disks and refrigerate for 1 hour.</TE>
<TE>   Flour a flat surface and roll out each disk 1/2 inch thick. Trim
the dough about 1/2 inch larger than each of 2 (2-quart) casserole
dishes that are 2 inches deep. Place each piece of dough on a baking
sheet or floured board and poke holes across the top using a fork.
Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.</TE>
<TE>   SAUCE</TE>

<TE>   6 bone-in chicken breasts, about 4 pounds</TE>
<TE>   3 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons flour</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   Melt 3 tablespoons of the butter in a deep, heavy-bottomed pot
over medium heat. Add the shallots and cook for 2 minutes without
browning before adding the chicken backs or wings, carrots, onion,
celery, leek, thyme, bay leaf and chicken stock. Bring to a boil and
simmer for 45 minutes before removing the carrots. Set the carrots
aside, covered. Cook the stock for 30 more minutes. When the carrots
have cooled slightly, cut them into small uniform pieces and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Add the chicken breasts to the pot and cook at a low simmer until
the chicken is cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the breasts,
cover and set aside. When cool enough to handle, remove the skin and
bones and set the meat aside.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, strain the stock into another pot and discard all of
the solid ingredients. Boil the stock at high heat until it is
reduced to a syrupy glaze, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the cream and
cook over low heat for 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Melt the remaining 1/4 cup of butter and mix in the flour. Whisk
the roux into the cream mixture with a whisk and continue stirring
while cooking over medium heat, 10 minutes. Strain the sauce into a
blender container.</TE>
<TE>   Blend the sauce until smooth and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Set aside to come to room temperature</TE>
<TE>   FILLING</TE>
<TE>   1 ounce dried morels and/or other wild mushrooms, such as porcini,
black trumpet, chanterelle</TE>
<TE>   1 bunch slender asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 pound green beans</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 ears corn</TE>
<TE>   10 ounces pearl onions</TE>
<TE>   Soak the dried mushrooms in cold water for 2 to 3 hours, then
rinse several times, changing the water each time until the water
remains clear.</TE>
<TE>   While the mushrooms soak, plunge the asparagus into boiling salted
water and cook at a full boil until bright green and crisp-tender, 4
minutes. Remove the asparagus, saving the water, and shock in ice
water until cold, 1 minute. Drain and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Trim the stem side of the beans, leaving the curly pointed tip
intact. Cut the beans in half and cook them in the same boiling water
used for asparagus until bright green and crisp-tender, 4 to 5
minutes. Drain and plunge the beans into ice water for 1 minute.
Drain and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   Bring another large pot of water to a boil. Add the sugar then the
corn. Boil the corn until tender, 5 to 8 minutes. You can pull an ear
out of the water, cut off a kernel or two, and taste for tenderness.
Remove the corn, saving the water, and set aside until the corn is
cool enough to handle. Cut the kernels off the cob and set aside,
covered.</TE>
<TE>   Plunge the onions into the same boiling water and cook until
tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove and let cool. Cut away the knob and
slide the outside skin off the onion. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   ASSEMBLY</TE>
<TE>   Filling</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, cut into wedge-shaped quarters</TE>
<TE>   1 bunch chives, minced</TE>
<TE>   Sauce</TE>
<TE>   Biscuit Crust</TE>
<TE>   Flour</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the Filling, mushrooms,
chives and the Sauce and divide between the baking dishes. Lay the
Biscuit Crust on top of the filling and sprinkle lightly with flour
(this gives the crust a more rustic look).</TE>
<TE>   Bake until the crust is golden brown and the pies are cooked
through, 35 to 40 minutes.</TE>

<LD>You may not know Swiss chard as well as, say, spinach, but this
earthy green has a wonderful, meaty mouth-feel. You can cook it the
same way you do spinach.</LD>
<LD>   Combine it with pasta, and you have a fast and different dinner.
This light tomato sauce is also a nice change from the usual heavy
red sauce.</LD>
<LD>   Pull some of those dried herbs from the cupboard and assemble the
crusty herb bread while the sauce cooks. Serve fresh fruit for
dessert, and pass a plate of cookies.</LD>

<HD>After the French Laundry, What?</HD>
<DH>The Schmitt family moves from restaurant to apple farm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIRA ADVANI HONEYCUTT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 20 years ago, Don and Sally Schmitt opened their dream
restaurant in the then-sleepy Napa Valley town of Yountville. It was
a small place they called the French Laundry. After running the homey
restaurant for 16 years, they sold it in 1994 to Thomas Keller. Today
it's among the most famous restaurants in the world--and the Schmitts
are farming apples.</LD>
<LD>   This is hardly the comedown it might seem. As co-owners of the
Apple Farm, they have carved out an idyllic, though hard-working,
life, farming more than 80 varieties of apples in Mendocino County's
Anderson Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The Schmitts had opened their first two restaurants in Yountville
in 1967. They were managing partners in the Vintage 1870 shopping
complex, where they operated the Chutney Kitchen and the Vintage
Cafe.</LD>
<TE>   "At the cafe, we served wonderful hamburgers and had the first
espresso machine in Napa Valley," recalls Sally. "It was a wonderful
time to be there. Napa was just awakening. All the vintners were
working together to prove that California wines can hold their place
in the world."</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, the Schmitts left Vintage 1870 and opened the French
Laundry, where, Sally notes, the cuisine was more Chez Panisse (the
two had lived in Berkeley) than three-star French. She ran the
kitchen; Don handled the front of the house. She had no formal
restaurant experience. Her resume consisted of a home economics
degree and cooking for her husband and five children. "And I just
like to cook," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Schmitts' reign, the restaurant was well known for its
food and its wine list, which was particularly deep in hard-to-find
older California bottlings. But eventually, it was time to move
along.</TE>
<TE>   "It was time for a change," says Sally. "We wanted to do one more
project while we had the strength. I'm thrilled to see Thomas do so
well. He clearly loves the property as much as we did and has taken
such good care of it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1982, the Schmitts were on the lookout for a retirement
property in the Anderson Valley when they spotted a distressed farm
with a "For Sale" sign. "So," Sally says, "I asked my daughter Karen
and her husband, Tim [Bates]: 'You want to be apple farmers?'" The
Schmitts and the Bates bought the farm in 1984, and the Bates set
about rescuing the property and turning it into an organic farm. The
Schmitts joined in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "We never thought of growing apples or getting into farming,"
recalls Sally. "I think one reason people love to come here is that
they see us doing what they dream of."</TE>
<TE>   The apple paradise they have created from an abandoned labor camp
is a 30-acre orchard, ranging from 100-year-old trees to seedlings.</TE>
<TE>   The Schmitts' and the Bates' labor of restoration has resulted in
a haven as well as a home and farm.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially with the world the way it is, it feels safer, more
secure, more real when it comes down to what really matters, " says
Sally.</TE>
<TE>   The sweet smell of apples envelops the Schmitts' and the Bates'
organic farm. The fruit stand nestled against the barn holds assorted
jars of jams and chutneys and bottles of cider vinegar, syrup and
apple juice. Wooden crates are filled with apples--Red and Golden
Delicious, Winter Banana, Sierra Beauty, Pippin and Greening. A
sample fruit next to a paring knife rests on top of each crate. In a
corner sits a neatly tied bundle of orchard prunings and a few apple
wreaths. A sign marked "New Product" is propped against bottles of
apple raspberry vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to apple orchards, the sprawling property holds the
Schmitts' and Bates' homes, a produce stand and four cabins designed
in a minimalist country style. "It borders on Shaker," Sally says.
"It's country without being cutesy." These cabins serve as residences
for guests who sign up for Sally's weekend cooking classes.</TE>
<TE>   Sally, who used to teach cooking classes in Napa Valley, says she
didn't realize how much she loved them until she started up again on
the farm. While she attends to the cooking in her Mediterranean-style
kitchen, Don plays the role of wine steward. "He keeps our wine
glasses full," Sally says.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend hands-on classes, which cover five meals from Friday
dinner to Sunday lunch, are limited to eight people and cost $300,
not including the cabin. The Thursday demonstration classes hold 16
and cost $55. The face-to-face contact in the classes adds another
dimension to Sally's earth-mother sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I have more of a chance to touch base with the people," she says.
"It's a wonderful way to get my message across to a lot of people."</TE>
<TE>   Sally's message concerns organic farming and sustainable
agriculture. She is pleased to see the heightened awareness of
consumers toward organic produce and the Chefs' Collaborative, an
organization that urges chefs to buy pesticide-free produce and
meats.</TE>
<TE>   The Schmitts' son John owns the nearby Booneville Hotel, and three
generations of their extended family work the farm. The 10
grandchildren pitch in to do farming, cutting fruit, labeling
products and stocking the produce stand.</TE>
<TE>   The fruit and products are available through markets, restaurants
and organic produce distributors in Northern California and via mail
order. "We believe in selling locally so you can use it at its best
and freshest," Sally says. Visitors can also pick up the fruit and
products such as the Schmitts and Bates' apple cider, apple balsamic
vinegar, syrup, apple juice and delicious jams and chutneys.</TE>
<TE>   What make the jams and chutneys so special are the hand-cut fruit
and pieces of nuts, dates and lemon peels that are distinctly
identifiable. The raspberry jam tastes like freshly picked fruit, its
seeds glistening like caviar pearls. All products are made in small
batches. Sally's mother's secret recipe was never to work with more
than four cups of fruit at a time. Sally and Karen, however, extend
their recipes to eight cups or amounts determined by the size of
their copper confiture pots. Most jams and chutneys are $10 per pint.
The vinegar is $12 for a 250-milliliter bottle; they are available
only at the farm or by phoning.And what is life like after the French
Laundry?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, golly," Sally says, "it's been wonderful to live in the
country away from the urban commuter kind of existence that so many
people have to live. At the same time, we have a constant flow of
visitors, old friends, customers, so we don't lack for company."</TE>

<LD>Somewhere in my refrigerator, it seems, there is always a container
of leftover rice. What to do with it?</LD>
<LD>   I imagined a salad as I wandered an aisle at the market, looking
at jars of artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers and olives. They all
can be tossed with rice--along with leftover roasted chicken--for
this easy dish.</LD>
<LD>   If you're crunched for time, use a purchased rotisserie chicken.
Bottled Italian dressing is also a quick substitute for the dressing.</LD>
<TE>   Make the salad ahead and chill it; just hold off adding the nuts
until serving time. If you prefer the salad warm, place the rice
mixture in a covered casserole dish and bake in a 375-degree oven for
about 20 minutes.</TE>

<TE>   Ancient Ojai Oil</TE>
<TE>   The Ojai Valley was once a thriving center of Californian olive
oil production, but for the better part of the last century, only the
occasional orchard of gnarled olive trees has escaped the ax. Now
Ojai citrus farmer Ron Asquith and his family have revived the
tradition. Working with olives from 120-year-old trees they found on
their orange farm, and yet more from young trees they have planted
recently, they pressed their first oil last November. The result is
an oil that is fruity and disarmingly fresh in a distinctive tall
blue bottle.</TE>
<TE>   First vintage Ojai Olive Oil, $15 for 375-milliliter bottles,
available at the Sunday Ojai farmers market, 300 E. Matilija St.,
Sundays 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. For more information, contact the Ojai Olive
Oil Co., (805) 646-5964 or send e-mail to info@ojaioliveoil.com.</TE>

<HD>Heirloom Tomato Sale: The Madness Goes On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You can't keep a good event down. Organizers of "Tomatomania," an
annual sale of heirloom tomato plants, feared the event was lost once
Hortus, the Pasadena nursery that originally hosted it, closed last
summer.</LD>
<LD>   But Hortus founder Gary Jones and managers Scott Daigre and Kate
Karam got together with chef Evan Kleiman of Angeli Caffe and
SlowfoodLA, roped in a small army of volunteer salespeople and will
use the Tapia Bros. Farm shop in Encino to stage the sale.</LD>
<LD>   Now, it's not only alive, it's kicking, says Daigre, a landscape
designer and former Hortus employee. The first sale 10 years ago
involved maybe 50 different types of tomatoes, he guesses. This year,
there will be more than 200.</LD>
<TE>   Daigre credits the success to Jones. "For the first sale, Gary
went out on a limb and had specialty tomatoes grown for him," he
says. "Los Angeles had never seen that before. It had never been
done. Then the public jumped on it with a fervor that he couldn't
believe."</TE>
<TE>   This year there will be 4-inch seedlings suitable for every
garden, courtyard or apartment balcony sold in quart pots for about
$3 a plant, Daigre says. "You can get an old French Jaune Flamme," he
says. "It's a melon-orange color, has a vining habit and roughly
golf-ball sized tomatoes that are beautiful in salads. They're kind
of tangy--a really bright taste."</TE>
<TE>   For lovers of a big red, he suggests trying the soft, steaky and
purple specimens called Russian Blacks that were collected by members
of the Iowa charity Seed Savers after the breakup of the former
Soviet Union. "Blacks have a real robust, full flavor that we're not
really used to. Some call it smoky," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Not every tomato is a relic from the past. There are relatively
modern hybrids celebrated for their taste and suitability for
containers so apartment dwellers can grow them. "Early Girl works
dynamite in containers," Daigre says. "Then there's Tommy Toe, Taxi."</TE>
<TE>   Ask a question and you had better be prepared to hear the answer;
Daigre, Jones and Haram don't call themselves "Tomatomaniacs" for
nothing. They can scarcely check their excitement about tomatoes: "We
said, Hortus is gone but we can't let this go. It's just a blast."</TE>
<TE>   Tomatomania, Tapia Bros. Farm, 5251 Hayvenhurst Blvd., Encino,
near the intersection of Hayvenhurst and Burbank boulevards, just off
Highway 101. Friday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</TE>

<HD>In Carneros, the Spotlight Is Now Falling on Merlot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not so long ago the name "Carneros" was automatically followed by
"Chardonnay" or "Pinot Noir" in most wine fans' minds. And that first
association still holds true. If anything, Carneros Chardonnay is
better than ever.</LD>
<LD>   But what about Carneros Pinot Noir? At one point the phrase was
ubiquitous to the point of cliche. In the late '80s Carneros was
hailed as the promised land of New World Pinot; Saintsbury Winery
used the slogan, "Beaune in the USA." But recently other areas, such
as the Russian River Valley, Sonoma Coast, Anderson Valley and Santa
Lucia Highlands, have swiped the Pinot hype, while Carneros has
seemed to lag.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, a Merlot movement was afoot. It began as a small but
significant part of the Cabernet Sauvignon explosion that led to the
Napa Valley's identity as a prominent New World outpost of Bordeaux.
In the brave new world post-phylloxera and post-French paradox,
Carneros Merlot has suddenly (in viticultural time) come on strong.</LD>
<TE>   California's first varietal Merlot was Martini's blend from the
1968 and '69 vintages, released in 1971. Sterling released its '69
Merlot the same year. Most subsequent plantings were intended for
blending with Cabernet, but a vogue for varietal Merlots in the
mid-1980s gave the varietal recognition and credibility with
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   By the late '90s, Merlot had its own varietal niche. During the
dynamic reorganization of Napa Valley vineyards in that period
(largely the result of phylloxera), Merlot was increasingly displaced
from prime Cabernet sites in the upper valley and, like Chardonnay,
concentrated in the southern valley.</TE>
<TE>   Producers bottling Napa Valley Merlots began to notice that
vineyards in cooler locations, especially in wind-whipped Carneros,
gave bright, clear fruit with better acidity and firmer tannin than
the warmer up-valley sites. That was demonstrated by the first
Carneros Merlot bottlings in 1979 and '80, by Martin Ray from Winery
Lake grapes, and it became increasingly apparent as new plantings
came into production.</TE>
<TE>   Currently about 10% of Carneros is planted to Merlot. In the 2001
vintage more than two dozen producers bottled Carneros Merlots, and
many more Merlots labeled Napa Valley, Sonoma Valley or Sonoma County
are substantially from Carneros vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   The cornerstone planting is Truchard Vineyard. Tony and Jo Ann
Truchard planted their first vines in 1974, when the Carneros hills
were still mostly grassland. When they produced their first
commercial wines 15 years later, a lovely Merlot was among them. It
was well received as an inaugural release, but no one guessed its
significance. Only in hindsight has it become clear that the '89
Truchard was the last signpost before the turnoff to an alternate
future for Carneros.</TE>
<TE>   The Truchards' first winemaker (1989-'94) was Michael Havens, a
former UC Davis literature professor who was already well known for
the excellent Merlots bottled at his own Havens Wine Cellars.
Starting with the 1989 Truchard estate Merlots, Havens made several
Carneros Merlots in each vintage, which was several more than just
about anybody at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Before Havens, Carneros Merlot was a nonentity. By the mid-'90s it
was a recognizable phenomenon, and Havens was the catalyst.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought Carneros was good for Merlot for the same
reasons it was thought to be good for Chardonnay and Pinot Noir,"
Havens said while tapping some barrels at Havens Wine Cellars near
Yountville one afternoon this March, "limiting soils, cooler peak
temperatures, a longer season with longer hang time."</TE>
<TE>   His voice came from deep in the barrel stacks, where he was
dipping his "thief" into barrels of '01 Merlot from various Carneros
vineyards he uses. He emerged from the maze of barrels with a lab
beaker full of garnet wine, his '01 reserve blend component from Hyde
Vineyard. Its perfume was ravishing and clear, like a rose garden as
the day begins to warm. The flavors were layered, from bright red
fruit to deeper black notes, and texture balanced plush fruit and
fine tannin with a real grip.</TE>
<TE>   We went on to taste other '01s from the Truchard and Beau Terroir
vineyards, both located near Hyde in the relatively warm northern
part of Carneros. Each was a slightly different expression.
Differences in soil, exposure, plant material and cultivation
translated into a range of aromatic intensities, red and black fruit
flavors, acid profiles and tannin textures. Yet they were all
complementary.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in blending different sites to obtain complexity," said
Havens. "Each site shows a different aspect of Carneros Merlot, and
they have enough in common that they fit together naturally."</TE>
<TE>   What they had in common was clear, high-toned fruit with a hint of
ripe herbaceous character that signaled Merlot; and, perhaps most
important, firm structure and definition. In contrast to the
typically loose, floppy, mouthful-of-grapes character of many
California Merlots, each of these wines had a beginning, a middle and
an end. I found myself recalling barrel tasting sessions in Pomerol
and St. Emilion--this, I felt, was classic Merlot, a very different
animal from the soft, pulpy, grape-syrup Merlots that inhabit
supermarket shelves.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not all of Carneros is suitable for Merlot. The Merlot
vine has its problems in a cool climate. Limited growth and crop
level are essential to ripen the fruit, and it needs substantial hang
time to develop mature tannins and flavors. So the vine needs stable
weather to set an even crop, and a relatively warm, sheltered
location with yield-limiting soils that produce grapes with more
concentrated, deeply colored fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Congress Valley, where Truchard is the largest grower, is an
elevated sun trap in the northern part of the district just west of
Napa, where the ground begins to rise into the Mayacamas foothills.
The terrain is like a rumpled blanket, with an array of exposures and
soils, mostly uplifted marine sediments with clay, interfolded with
well-drained volcanic deposits. It's suitable for a number of grape
varieties--there are even locations where Cabernet ripens fairly
reliably.</TE>
<TE>   There is already talk of a Congress Valley American Viticultural
Area. Observers note the same kind of buzz around Congress Valley
that attended Stags Leap in the early 1980s, so the next few vintages
may well provide the rare opportunity to watch--and taste along
with--the creation of an AVA.</TE>
<TE>   The sloping plateau in the Duhig Road area of east-central
Carneros is another notable Merlot area. Its soils are more typical
of Carneros in general: shallow clay loams formed from ancient marine
sediments. Clos Pegase, Cuvaison and Shafer Vineyards have
substantial Merlot plantings there.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to the water, where the whole of Carneros seems to slope
into the northern reach of San Francisco Bay like a vast boat ramp,
the historic Las Amigas Vineyard--once famous for Pinot Noir--is
showing new promise as an outstanding Merlot site. The vineyard is
now owned by grower Andy Beckstoffer. He continues to grow Pinot, but
the spotlight is increasingly on his Merlot vines.</TE>
<TE>   Las Amigas has so far yielded such luscious, surprisingly powerful
vineyard designates as the '99 Merryvale and Behrens &amp; Hitchcock Las
Amigas bottlings.</TE>
<TE>   There are also proven Merlot sites on the Sonoma side. Sangiacomo
Vineyards grows Merlot at the Donnell and Kiser ranches in sheltered
spots with shallow clay-loam soils where Carneros begins to morph
into Sonoma Valley. Ravenswood's "Sangiacomo" Merlot is an
outstanding example of what that area can produce.</TE>
<TE>   Havens believes the shallow, clay-based soils are as important as
the cool climate. "It's a good match of situation and grape variety,"
he says. "In France, Chile, everywhere in the world good Merlot is
produced, it grows on clay soils. The Pomerol plateau, where Petrus
is, is almost pure clay. It's a friend to Merlot because it gradually
metes out the moisture which allows grapes to ripen over a long
period and get phenolic ripeness."</TE>
<TE>   A significant endorsement for Carneros Merlot came with the recent
announcement that grower Larry Hyde (whose Merlot goes primarily to
Michael Havens, Joseph Phelps and Flora Springs) has entered a
partnership with Domaine de la Romanee-Conti managing director Aubert
de Villaine to produce wines from Hyde Vineyard fruit under the HdV
label (the first wines were produced in 2000). The varietal roster
includes Chardonnay, of course, and a Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon
blend--but no Pinot Noir.</TE>

<LD>DEAR SOS: On my last vacation to Minnesota, I purchased several bags
of wild rice. Do you have a good recipe for wild rice soup?</LD>
<LD>   JUDY LITTLE</LD>
<LD>   Dana Point</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DEAR JUDY: Yes, we do. This recipe was printed in 1992. It's from
the St. Paul Hotel in St. Paul, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cream of Minnesota Wild Rice Soup</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 45 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup wild rice</TE>
<TE>   1 cup (2 sticks) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 cups chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound bacon, finely diced</TE>
<TE>   1 onion, chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound carrots, chopped</TE>
<TE>   4 stalks celery, diced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons diced red pimentos</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1 to 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 cups half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   Bring 2 cups of salted water to boil in a saucepan. Add the rice
and simmer, covered, until the rice is tender but still has some bite
to it, 35 to 40 minutes. It will not absorb all the water. Drain.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, melt the butter in a skillet over low heat. Add the
flour and blend well. Cook, stirring, until light golden, 8 to 10
minutes. Be careful it doesn't brown.</TE>
<TE>   Heat 6 cups of the chicken stock to a simmer in a large saucepan.
Whisk in the flour mixture until smooth. Strain the mixture.</TE>
<TE>   Wipe the pan clean and heat over medium-high heat. Add the bacon
and cook until almost crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the onion,
carrots, celery and mushrooms. Cook until tender, stirring
occasionally, 10 minutes. Stir in the pimentos, bay leaf and thyme.
Season to taste with salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Add the stock mixture and wild rice to the pot. Simmer over
medium-low heat, 20 to 30 minutes, adding more stock if the soup
becomes dry. Stir in the half-and-half and heat to serving
temperature. The soup will be thick. Adjust the salt and pepper to
taste. Remove the bay leaf before serving.</TE>

<HD>Tiny Academy Finds Big Picture in Nature</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the northwest corner of the sprawling North Hollywood High School
campus, students are being encouraged to think naturally.</LD>
<LD>   Shaded by trees and surrounded by legumes, buckwheat and cloves is
the Naturalist Academy, a five-acre garden and farm area complete
with a greenhouse and a classroom.</LD>
<LD>   It's a so-called "small learning community," which funnels 100
recruited students through their high school years in the tradition
of horticulturally minded great thinkers. The goal? To make them
sensitive to nature while satisfying all the requirements for a high
school diploma.</LD>
<TE>   "We look at nature as your sort of guide to the big picture," said
Randy Vail, the teacher who started the academy at North Hollywood
three years ago. "We teach that ecology is the economics of nature,
and economics is the ecology of society."</TE>
<TE>   There are seven small learning communities at North Hollywood,
with such themes as social justice and media. Also known as
academies, the communities were created to ease the social and
learning problems caused by overcrowding on the year-round campus and
offer a strong academic focus.</TE>
<TE>   A few other Los Angeles Unified School District campuses are
trying such small learning communities, but none has gotten as far as
North Hollywood in practical details and philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   While the school's well-known highly gifted and biological science
magnets draw students from all over the district, the academies take
students only from North Hollywood's feeder zone. Each academy
enrolls 100 to 400 students, who are segregated into their
communities with a few exceptions for gym and Advanced Placement
classes. The idea is to have the group of students and teachers go
through the four-year high school experience together.</TE>
<TE>   At the Naturalist Academy, the faculty hopes that graduates lead
environmentally responsible lives. Teachers are assigned to teach
traditional subjects such as math, English and science, weaving an
environmental theme into the subject matter.</TE>
<TE>   For example, students write poetry under the trees in the garden
for English class. In history, students learn how the Mayans may have
depleted their natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   Students in health class once had to collect their daily garbage
in a plastic bag and carry it around campus to illustrate how much
trash a person created in a day.</TE>
<TE>   Vail, who holds a bachelor's degree from UC Irvine and did
graduate work at UCLA, teaches horticulture, health and Advanced
Placement classes in history and human geography. Three other
teachers are assigned to teach English, science and math to the 100
"Naturalists."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most unusual part of the Naturalist Academy is the
students' hands-on work. They are just as likely to carry a pitchfork
as a pen. They water plants, rake leaves, hack weeds and plant seeds.
But it's not to be confused with agricultural education, which has a
mandated curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids aren't going to be farmers," Vail said. "It's not like
I'm trying to teach organic farming so that they'll become organic
farmers. But maybe they'll grow up buying organic products."</TE>
<TE>   And if a student questions the combining of intellectualism and
agriculture, Vail throws out a few famous examples: Edward O. Wilson,
John Muir, Charles Darwin and Voltaire.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "militant environmentalist," Vail is just as much
the attraction as the work itself, his students say. He can be
abrasive, sarcastic and supportive at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm raking to get on his [good] side," said ninth-grader Ryan
Avila, pushing leaves into a pile recently during health class.</TE>
<TE>   Vail's classroom is decorated with photos of Kurt Vonnegut, Dennis
Hopper and Cesar Chavez. Bumper stickers reading "Question Authority"
and "Hug a Farmer" are plastered on his desk front. A life-size
wooden statue of Nelson Mandela holding up his fist occupies one
corner.</TE>
<TE>   Vail, who used to teach in the campus highly gifted magnet,
decided to begin the Naturalist Academy because he wanted to help
kids who had hidden potential, he said. Before each school year, he
scours for possible Naturalists by looking at students with high
Stanford 9 test scores who are not in an honors or gifted program. He
calls them "previously unidentified gifted kids."</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to be extraordinarily smart," said ninth-grader
and Naturalist Ben Ruano. "You just have to want to learn."</TE>
<TE>   North Hollywood Principal John Hyland said he instituted the
program for the academies three years ago as a way to make young
people feel less anonymous on the 4,000-student campus. "We want them
to feel part of a community," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hyland said he was inspired by the success of similar academies
that began sprouting up in overcrowded high schools in New York City
in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Naturalist Academy, North Hollywood has the
Entertainment and Media Academy, which sends students to work with
screenwriters at Universal Studios, and the Bilingual Teacher
Training Academy, which allows students to work in elementary schools
to get a feel for a career in teaching. The school's other academies
include Social Justice, Transportation Careers, Translation and
Interpretation and the Globe Academy for ESL students.</TE>
<TE>   "My dream is that the whole high school will [be composed] of
autonomous units with their own budgets that will be able to stand on
their own two feet," Hyland said.</TE>
<TE>   Megan Rosner, the Naturalist Academy's English teacher, described
her students as a "family." She left Roosevelt High School in Los
Angeles two years ago and chose the Naturalist Academy partly because
she said wanted to work with Vail.</TE>
<TE>   "This a pure, positive thing," she said. "A lot of education is
stuck on testing. But there is so much more to develop in
students.... The emphasis on the environment is important because
it's about living."</TE>
<TE>   Diana Aguilar, an 11th-grader in Rosner's class, said the academy
would help her prepare for college because it offered several AP
courses. It's also not as intense as the highly gifted magnet
program.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not characterized as a nerd," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Inna Bergal, who is in the same class, said she turned down the
highly gifted magnet to join the Naturalist Academy because she liked
the students and teachers. It also taught her to be more
environmentally sensitive.</TE>
<TE>   "Before this, I couldn't care less about recycling," she said.</TE>

<HD>Craftmanship as a Door to Artisanship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Can we rejoice when society bestows esteem on its artisans and trade
workers?</LD>
<LD>   I'm not speaking of this society, of course.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps you saw The Times' dispatch from Germany last month about
the wandering craftswomen and men, known as wandergesellen. In a
tradition that dates back to the Middle Ages, they move from job to
job for at least three years and a day. Then they go on to become
journeymen roofers and carpenters and bricklayers and 27 other useful
occupations, not to mention start their own businesses and manage
projects.</LD>
<TE>   We should cheer stories like this because, first off, we need
roofers and carpenters and bricklayers. Second, we shouldn't forget
the level of skill that people must acquire to do these things
properly, which is only the first step toward doing them
artistically. Most important, this story reminded us that there is
honor and satisfaction in creating things with one's hands.</TE>
<TE>   Honor and satisfaction. Ever notice how rarely we use those words
anymore when referring to our activities?</TE>
<TE>   It was the seventh grade when I took my first shop class. I built
a mahogany jewelry box for my mother. I was amazed to learn how a box
was made and more amazed that I could make one.</TE>
<TE>   The joy of that discovery enriched my life. In spare time over the
years, I have made cutlery and furniture, I have worked with clay and
with leather. I built a canoe from strips of redwood. I have learned
to carve Polynesian fishhooks from bone for adornment. I sewed myself
a jacket, made toys for the neighbor kids, designed and stitched my
own wallet. I built my dining table from rough-sawed planks of
cherry, using only hand tools. Drop-by evening visitors are surprised
to find the columnist in his apron in the garage, chortling as he
discovers the secrets of an old carving tool called a scorp.</TE>
<TE>   I gained confidence. I learned to lay a roof, rebuild a bathroom,
make cabinets, tile a floor, rewire the lighting and vent the hood
over a stove.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, I came to appreciate artisanship. I began looking
up to those who, by profession or pastime, can fit square pegs into
round holes. In a fleeting world of electrons, what they do is
tangible. You cannot fake a fence.</TE>
<TE>   So I was disappointed to see a subsequent story in the newspaper.
It was just the latest installment in a decades-long string of
accounts that denigrate what we call "vocational education" in U.S.
schools. This curriculum is dying out. Those courses that remain are
stigmatized. Boys and girls from the underclass are "shunted" into
them and their dreams are ruined as a result.</TE>
<TE>   The story quoted a university admissions bureaucrat: An applicant
who took a British literature elective in high school is likely to be
favored over an equally qualified student who took shop.</TE>
<TE>   I have nothing against British literature. But shouldn't we make
room in our schools to expand students' experience, to open their
eyes to the realities around them, to provide means for them to
understand their capabilities, to reconnect their hands to their
minds, learn the secrets of a wooden box? No wonder Bill Gates
dropped out of Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   "Of all human qualities, the one I admire most is competence,"
wrote H.L. Mencken. "A tailor who is really able to cut and fit a
coat seems to me an admirable man, and by the same token a university
professor who knows little or nothing of the thing he presumes to
teach seems to me to be a fraud and a rascal."</TE>
<TE>   What our schools teach--and increasingly what we demand in the way
of test scores--is growing regrettably narrower and more conformist.
It's single-track college prep with some athletics thrown in. Too
bad. With specialization crushing in on us we need rounding out: home
ec, sewing, wood shop.</TE>
<TE>   With fewer parents able to pass craft skills on to their children,
the responsibility of our schools is even greater. I can attest: All
those math classes to master the slide rule proved worthless.
Learning to saw a board is a skill worth having. Adding more shop
classes will engender appreciation of artisanship as part of a good
education. A new generation should find out what they can do with
their hands, and the honest value of what others do for society with
theirs.</TE>
<TE>   And P.S. to the university admissions officer: The British
recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1953 was an avid
bricklayer. At his peak, Winston Churchill could lay 90 bricks an
hour. In the yard of his country home of Chartwell, you can read a
tablet he set in one of the many structures he raised: "The greater
part of this wall was built between the years 1925 &amp; 1932 by Winston
with his own hands."</TE>

<LD>As the U.S. war on terrorism inches us into closer alliances with
regimes we might otherwise hold at arm's length, we can't fall into
the Cold War trap of allowing national interests to impugn our
national character.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, Pakistan was on its way to joining Afghanistan in
becoming a failed state. The country's military ruler, Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, was an ardent supporter of the Taliban regime, while the
military-intelligence complex he controlled was responsible for
weapons proliferation throughout the Middle East and Asia, along with
the export of extremists across the Muslim world. U.S. sanctions and
$11 billion in external debt had the country on the verge of economic
collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Following the attacks, U.S. officials determined that support and
assistance of neighboring states would be essential to wage an
effective campaign in Afghanistan. Thus an alliance of convenience
was born, and the floodgates of financial assistance were opened. But
as the war drags on, evidence now suggests that the commitments that
serve as the basis for this alliance--preventing Al Qaeda and Taliban
forces from crossing the border, granting U.S. aircraft landing
rights, renouncing extremism--are no longer being met.</LD>
<TE>   The foremost cause for concern has been Pakistan's unwillingness
to effectively patrol its border with Afghanistan. During the first
three months of the U.S. bombing campaign, the United Nations
estimated that 1,000 to 2,000 Afghans were crossing the border each
day. Pakistani officials say they don't have the resources to stop
them, yet they have refused to allow U.S. troops to enter Pakistan
while in pursuit of retreating Taliban soldiers. "I don't think that
doing this is in the coalition's interest or in Pakistan's interest,"
Musharraf said.</TE>
<TE>   The option of using U.S. air power to help control Pakistan's
border also has been stymied under terms of a classified lease
agreement. Although the forward deployment of nearly 2,000 troops on
three Pakistani air bases has been held up as a symbol of Pakistani
cooperation, it is not the "blanket landing rights" to which Pakistan
committed. Despite paying for access to these bases, the U.S. Army
remains limited to stationing only helicopters in Pakistan, thereby
requiring the Air Force to use less-equipped bases in Kyrgyzstan and
beyond.</TE>
<TE>   The British encountered similar difficulties last month when the
HMS Ocean sought to unload an expeditionary force destined for
Afghanistan, only to be denied docking privileges in Karachi. The
troops are being flown to the U.S.-controlled Bagram air base in
Afghanistan. This despite Pakistan's pledge of full docking
privileges.</TE>
<TE>   Most disturbing has been Musharraf's unwillingness to definitively
break his country's ties to extremism. Publicly, he has committed
himself to the war effort in a series of speeches and visits designed
for an international audience. But at home, Musharraf consistently
calls for an early withdrawal of U.S. troops from the region,
promulgates specious reports of Osama bin Laden's death, denies the
presence of Taliban and Al Qaeda militants in Pakistan, releases
militants from jail and calls for the inclusion of former Taliban
officials in the new Afghan government. Are these the actions of an
ally?</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that he is torn between meeting his international
commitments and placating powerful Islamic interests at home, we have
condoned Musharraf's backsliding thus far. But Pakistan's actions
stand out as inimical to U.S. objectives. In a campaign where, as
President Bush has declared, "you are either with us or with the
terrorists," Pakistan must recommit itself to the principles of the
war on terrorism or be prepared to accept the consequences.</TE>

<LD>Public service announcements on TV about the drug Ecstasy, sponsored
by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, inform us that users take
their lives in their hands. They show images of young people passed
out on dance floors with oblivious, drug-addled revelers all around
them. We hear voice-overs of coroner's reports giving the gruesome
details of an Ecstasy related death.</LD>
<LD>   As is often the case with this organization's campaigns (remember
"This is your brain on drugs" with a picture of two fried eggs?), the
ads neglect to mention anything that can be done to prevent death
from occurring, save complete abstinence.</LD>
<LD>   Following the slogan coined by Nancy Reagan in the 1980s, the
partnership wants our kids to "just say no."</LD>
<TE>   As a parent, I know that saying no to my daughter does not always
work. In fact, it sometimes encourages her to rebel.</TE>
<TE>   Even First Lady Laura Bush, whose own children's escapades have
been fodder for news coverage, was recently quoted as saying that
"there's a certain time when children are not going to do what their
parents want them to."</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is this: Statistics show that Ecstasy use is on
the rise, year after year. The kids aren't saying no.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way that most adults see the sense in teaching safe
sex instead of preaching sexual abstinence to teens, we need to adopt
a more enlightened approach to educating our young people about
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Informing parents and teens about certain behaviors and
precautions can save lives.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of dire warnings and worst-case scenarios--which many
teens discount because they haven't experienced them yet--we can
offer practical guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   A true public service message would tell kids: If you choose to
use drugs, here's how to be more safe:</TE>
<TE>   * Mixing Ecstasy with other drugs or alcohol increases risk.</TE>
<TE>   * Heatstroke is a major life-threatening concern with Ecstasy.
Stay cool, take plenty of breaks from dancing and drink water.</TE>
<TE>   * Over-hydration is another danger. Drinking too much water while
on Ecstasy can cause serious, potentially fatal complications. Drink
only enough fluids to replace what is lost through sweating. A pint
an hour is plenty.</TE>
<TE>   * "Less is more." Taking one tablet carries less risk than two and
so on. This also goes for frequency of use. People who use Ecstasy
repeatedly risk depression, panic attacks or other psychiatric
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   There are reports of correlation between high-dose repeated
Ecstasy use and poor performance on memory tests.</TE>
<TE>   * Testing the contents of Ecstasy pills may reduce the risks
associated with impurities in tablets.</TE>
<TE>   * As with all drugs, driving, operating machinery or making
important decisions (such as whether or not to have sex) should be
deferred until sober.</TE>
<TE>   Many government agencies are wary that giving honest information
about drugs "sends the wrong message" to today's youth.</TE>
<TE>   Yet saying that a drug is dangerous or forbidden is simply not
enough when dealing with curious, novelty-seeking adolescents who
often see themselves as invulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Sex education has gone a long way toward reducing sexually
transmitted diseases and pregnancy among our nation's youth. It's
time to adopt X education--honest information about Ecstasy and other
drugs--to prevent more young people from dying.</TE>

<HD>The Pressure Is On to Play the Oil Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY RIFKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 30 years ago, the Arab oil-producing countries in the Middle
East first used oil as a weapon against Israel, the U.S. and their
allies. The 1973 OPEC oil embargo, which came on the heels of the Yom
Kippur War between Israel and its Arab neighbors--Egypt and
Syria--rocked the post-World War II global order. Oil prices
quadrupled, motorists waited in long lines at filling stations and
the global economy began to slide into a prolonged recession. Can
this happen again?</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, there will be threats. On Monday, Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein announced that his country was suspending the export
of its oil for 30 days or until Israel ends its incursion into
Palestinian territories. But Saudi Arabia--OPEC's largest
producer--says it opposes using oil as a weapon and, on Tuesday,
announced that it will ensure that consuming nations have enough
supply to make up for the losses caused by Iraq. Iraq is the
sixth-largest oil supplier to the U.S., providing about 9% of U.S.
oil imports.</LD>
<LD>   Yet Saudi reassurances might not be the end of it. Both Iran and
Libya announced that they would support an oil embargo if other Arab
countries agreed to go along with the Iraqis.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, oil prices have risen dramatically in the past five
months since the violence escalated between Israel and the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the prevailing wisdom on the street is that there is "a
very low possibility" that other Arab oil producers would cut oil
supplies to exert pressure in Israel and the U.S. Still, as Hussein's
move on Monday demonstrates, things could change quickly, and the
consequences could be profound and far-reaching.</TE>
<TE>   While in the short run Russia, Norway, Canada, Mexico and other
non-OPEC oil producers also could ramp up production to keep oil
flowing to the West, even the partial withdrawal of OPEC oil from
world markets could send the price of oil soaring. Were that to
happen, it would trigger a devastating downturn in the global
economy, hitting developing nations the hardest.</TE>
<TE>   Recall that it was the rise in oil prices in the 1970s and 1980s
that was a major cause of the escalating debt crisis in Third World
countries. Unable to afford the high price of oil on world markets,
developing nations were forced to secure billions of dollars in
commercial and institutional loans to pay for more expensive oil
imports and the increasing cost of all the other activities
associated with higher oil bills.</TE>
<TE>   A widespread oil embargo could plunge many developing countries
into an economic abyss from which they might not be able to recover.</TE>
<TE>   How likely is it that Arab oil-producing countries might impose
restrictions on the flow of oil, even if it meant a drop in revenue
for their own governments?</TE>
<TE>   Much depends on how powerless and desperate they feel in the wake
of the increasing violence between Israel and the Palestinians. If
the Arab governments conclude they have no other avenue available to
them, oil might become the weapon of last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Then too, if younger Islamic fundamentalists in the Middle East
and around the world escalate demands against the Saudis and other
Arab producers to use the oil card as a weapon, and if they begin to
take to the streets in large numbers, as they already have in Iraq,
chanting "Arab oil for the Arabs," the pressure might become too
serious for their governments to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Many younger Muslim fundamentalists view oil as "a soft loan from
Allah." They see oil as the great equalizer, a spiritual as well as
geopolitical weapon that, if Islamized in the service of Allah, could
lead to the second coming of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia sensed as much in the aftermath of the
oil shock of the 1970s and early 1980s, and he told his fellow
Muslims that "the main resource to depend upon after God is oil."
Radical Muslims like to point out that 10 of the 13 OPEC nations are
Islamic states.</TE>
<TE>   While hardened geopolitical analysts in the West snicker at the
idea that Allah bestowed such a gift on the upholders of the faith,
no one dares laugh when Osama bin Laden urges his followers around
the world to reclaim the Saudi holy land, establish a universal
Islamic state and raise the price of oil astronomically.</TE>
<TE>   The story of oil gives credence to the idea that what goes around
eventually comes around. Oil, the energy that helped make the West
the unchallenged economic, political and cultural force in the world
in the 20th century, could become its undoing at the hands of an
Islamic world determined to turn the tables and restore its former
status as the world's spiritual and cultural arbiter. Of this much we
can be sure: Oil and Islam are inseparably linked. The fate of one
will, to a great extent, determine the fate of the other.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission's decisive 4-1 decision to deny
Chief Bernard C. Parks a second five-year term is expected to mean
the end of Parks' enduring 37-year career with the Police Department.
Parks has put up a mighty fight, masterfully fought--he's a much
better politician than his foe, Mayor James K. Hahn--but he
unsurprisingly failed to get the support he needed from the
mayor-appointed commission. Now what?</LD>
<LD>   The tenacious chief has said he will pursue his next option:
appealing to the City Council and hoping he can find support to
overturn the commission's decision. That's highly unlikely, and even
his staunchest supporters know it. He's a strong-willed leader who
has accomplished much; we wish he would walk away proud of his long
service. It's clear he won't do that, at least not yet.</LD>
<LD>   The City Charter change that created the five-year appointment did
not intend reappointment to be automatic. Parks, appointed by a
different mayor and Police Commission, didn't embrace the priorities
held by this mayor and this Police Commission. Parks' time at the
helm of the LAPD looks effectively ended, but he may have a bright
political career ahead of him if he wants it.</LD>
<TE>   For anyone who cares about Los Angeles, there's certainly no glee
in this tangled civic mess. A tight-lipped Hahn welcomed the
commission's decision but claimed he didn't seek to influence it. Of
course he did, when he suddenly announced in February that he didn't
support a second Parks term. Hahn, despite a lifetime in politics,
apparently didn't understand that it doesn't matter whether a
decision is right if you handle it all wrong. The way it was
repeatedly bungled set in motion political convulsions that are
likely to be with the city for a long while.</TE>
<TE>   The bizarre racial politics surrounding the battle between Hahn
and Parks went to new heights Tuesday: Hours before the mayor's
Police Commission voted to oust Parks, the same commission had
African American activist Danny Bakewell arrested during its meeting
because he spoke beyond his allotted time. He was escorted out of the
meeting by police officers while his supporters sang "We Shall
Overcome." What's the next brilliant move for the Hahn administration
to calm racial tension in Los Angeles? Round up Rep. Maxine Waters?
And what are black leaders going to do to calm racial tension in Los
Angeles? Compare this struggle to keep their individual political
fiefdoms and exact revenge against Hahn to the civil rights movement?</TE>
<TE>   It's been that kind of year. And the prospect doesn't brighten as
we look to daunting challenges ahead for Hahn, challenges that would
test even a talented politician. There's heightening friction in the
city between regions and between ethnic and racial groups. How
Hahn--with, we hope, a better team than the one that advised him on
this issue--manages the leadership questions now facing the Police
Department may well determine the rest of his term.</TE>

<LD>Need a room to hold a meeting? The Los Angeles Convention Center just
might be able to accommodate you.</LD>
<LD>   The bottom fell out of the tourism business here after last year's
terrorist attacks in the East. The convention center hit especially
bleak times. Now with the lights out as often as they're on, the
center's 720,000 square feet of exhibit space, 64 meeting rooms and
5,600 parking spaces equal so much yawning space. In fact, the city
may have to cough up $7 million in general funds to make debt
payments for the center's 1993 expansion.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of conventions booked into the center have canceled in the
last three years, and the big money that conventioneers would have
spent at restaurants and hotels is lost, along with the tax revenue
generated for city coffers. Worse still, there's only a handful of
convention bookings on the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau is the private,
nonprofit group responsible for renting the convention center and
promoting regional tourism. The city pays the bureau $17 million a
year. Now, with the center so often empty, local leaders are asking
whether that money could be better spent.</TE>
<TE>   Revival of convention business rests on a concerted public-private
effort. Cities that do a big convention business have lots of hotel
rooms within walking distance of their convention centers. Los
Angeles has only 650 rooms, nothing compared with the 9,400 rooms Las
Vegas offers or San Francisco's 5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles needs more hotels in downtown's south end. But without
solid convention bookings, no hotel chain has wanted to take on such
a risky venture. The City Council and Mayor James K. Hahn could solve
this chicken-or-egg problem by offering tax incentives, perhaps a
rebate on the city's hotel bed tax, to encourage construction.</TE>
<TE>   The council has already approved a plan for new development around
Staples Center, including restaurants, shops and theaters. Phoenix
and Cleveland do bang-up convention business and they don't have
nearly the attractions that Los Angeles has. The mayor and council
should insist on performance standards and public oversight of the
bureau in exchange for the millions it pays the organization to bring
in conventioneers, or else yank the contract when it expires in June
of 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Unless the bureau and Hahn do much more to market downtown, the
city's turquoise convention center may soon become a hulking white
elephant.</TE>

<HD>A Dose of Herbal Reform</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aging baby boomers facing their mortality and teenagers seeking to
bulk up have helped the dietary supplement industry explode in size.
Since 1994 its sales have doubled to $16 billion a year. A national
poll by Blue Cross and Blue Shield finds that 8% of 17- and
18-year-olds have used sports supplements. Yet, as Ray F. Herndon
wrote in a front-page story in Thursday's Times, there is growing
alarm about the safety of the largely unregulated industry's
products. Herndon illustrated the problem with the case of Alaskan
Rosie Talbert, who successfully sued the Utah-based company E'Ola
after suffering a stroke at a time when she was taking its diet
remedy.</LD>
<LD>   For Talbert and others, recognition of the dangers of supplements
has been slow because so little is required of supplement makers. It
is not possible to regulate every herbal remedy, but to protect
consumers Congress needs to set minimum standards.</LD>
<LD>   Among the most widely used supplements are ephedra and
androstenedione. Ephedra is the more dangerous; the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration
have linked this junior cousin of methamphetamine to heart attacks,
seizures, strokes and deaths. Other studies indicate that
androstenedione, used to increase muscle mass, increases estrogen
levels in males, leading to enlarged breasts and reduction of healthy
HDL cholesterol.</LD>
<TE>   One product, Andro 9, contains an herb called Tribulus terrestris,
which  sharply raises testosterone and is known to cause liver damage
and other problems in sheep. No one knows what its effect is in
humans.</TE>
<TE>   Why? Well, because Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), whose state is
home to about one-fifth of supplement manufacturing, fiercely rejects
the hand of government on this profitable industry. Hatch is
responsible for the 1994 Dietary Supplement and Health Education Act.
It requires the FDA to treat supplements as essentially harmless--as
food products. There are no safety reviews or strict labeling
requirements. The amounts of active ingredients in these powders and
liquids can vary wildly even from dose to dose. Label information
rarely includes warnings, for instance that herbal remedies may
interfere significantly with prescription drugs. Manufacturers need
not register their products with the FDA. It is not government
interference to demand that such gaping holes be closed. It is
minimum consumer protection.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-San Diego) has introduced two bills that
would begin to set better standards. She would ban the sale of
ephedrine alkaloids to individuals under 18. Her proposed Dietary
Supplement Information Act would also require supplement makers and
distributors to register with the FDA and report adverse reactions
without delay. In addition, the FDA would be authorized to inspect
the makers' facilities and safety records.</TE>
<TE>   Even minimal reforms would cause howls of indignation among the
spoiled, powerful makers of supplements. But consumers like Rosie
Talbert should not be unknowing guinea pigs for an industry unwilling
to police itself.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mahony E-Mails Cite Fears Over Scandals," April 6: Your coverage
of the Los Angeles Archdiocese and Cardinal Roger Mahony went over
the top. The Fresno woman's charge merits nothing more than back-page
coverage until she comes up with something more substantial than she
has produced so far. At this stage, her unsubstantiated charge is
nothing more than an allegation by a perhaps deranged woman.</LD>
<LD>   The e-mails actually are helpful to the cardinal, as I read the
one that you printed in full. His instructions to his attorney were
about as clear as he could get without being disrespectful. If there
are only eight priests involved, the story has gotten about as much
ink as it deserves.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read with growing disgust your article on the contents of
Cardinal Mahony's e-mail. Disgust with the cardinal? No, that came a
long time ago. This disgust was with radio station KFI and The Times
for stooping to such a low of publishing the contents of stolen
e-mail, much of which appeared to contain privileged attorney-client
communications. This definitely is a classic example of yellow
journalism at its very worst. And Steve Lopez would be a lot more
believable if his pen were not dipped in quite so much vitriol when
he writes about the cardinal.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those who would place the blame for the scandal now raging within
the Catholic Church upon the media, in particular The Times
(''Catholics Grapple with Mixed Feelings on Church Scandals,'' April
8), are as misdirected as were Richard Nixon's Oval Office minions
when they attempted to pressure the Washington Post not to publish
stories about the growing Watergate scandal. Then, as now, the press
was doing nothing more than what the Oval Office or the Catholic
hierarchy should have been doing--publicizing, policing and
prosecuting the evil within.</TE>
<TE>   If media critics want to vent their collective anger, they need
only consider the genesis of the current problem within the church:
criminal activity quickly followed by denial, blame-shifting,
stonewalling, half-truths, obstruction of justice, incompetence, the
payment of hush money, silence and an overarching disregard for the
welfare of innocent victims.</TE>

<TE>   I maintain complete trust and confidence in Cardinal Mahony. I
believe he is a just leader of my Catholic Church in Los Angeles. I
shall continue always to be faithful to the teachings of my church,
and I will now even increase my tithing to my church.</TE>
<TE>   My faith is deeply rooted in Jesus Christ. I believe the holy
spirit will heal my Catholic Church and allow my church to be
cleansed of the sins of the few priests who have betrayed their own
very sacred and holy vows. Vows made to God! My faith is unwavering,
and I shall try even harder to be a better man and to pray for my
church. And I shall strive to be even more compassionate to every
individual hurt by the misdeeds of the few. And I shall pray for
forgiveness for those priests who have sinned and who have been
disobedient to church and civil laws.</TE>

<TE>   Re "The Church Must Exorcise the Demon of Celibacy," Opinion,
April 7: Now that the subject of married priests has surfaced on such
a wide scale, it seems that the very nature of the job description,
requiring family counseling, would be an obvious benefit to members
of the Catholic community. St. Peter and the other married priests of
their time could relate to family problems as well as spiritual
turmoil among the members of their flock.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Catholic hierarchy who drew up the celibacy laws of
the second Lateran Council in 1139 certainly were not being
Christlike, considering that Christ appointed Peter, who was married,
to be the first pope. Greed reared its ugly head and has never
released its stranglehold.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Jews Cannot Acquiesce to Sharon's Monstrous Behavior,"
Commentary, April 9: Contrary to Robert Scheer's hysterical and
offensive diatribe, Israel's current actions in the West Bank are
fully justified and focused on destroying terrorists, not simply
murdering innocent civilians as the Palestinians have been doing.
Indeed, these actions should have taken place 18 months ago. Many
innocent lives would have been spared.</LD>
<LD>   It is the Palestinians who deliberately have been targeting the
innocent. The Israelis have been hunting down the murderers of their
men, women and children, who were going about their daily lives. How
can any sane, reasonable adult be blind to the stark differences in
the goals and tactics being used?</LD>
<LD>   The first sentence of our Constitution sets forth as fundamental
responsibilities of government to provide for the common defense and
secure domestic tranquillity. Why does Israel not have the same right
as we do to protect its citizens against an enemy that observes no
rules whatever of human decency?</LD>
<TE>   Stephen J. Makler</TE>
<TE>   Mount Holly, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The way that Scheer equates Ariel Sharon, whose forces try to
avoid civilian casualties, with Yasser Arafat, who targets civilians,
is preposterous. The Palestinian Arabs have themselves to blame for
the military retaliation that Israel has taken to protect itself. A
majority of Americans understand this, even if Scheer does not.</TE>
<TE>   Gershon Hepner</TE>

<TE>   King George II demands Israel cut short its anti-terror mission
before it's completed, reminding me of George I when he stopped the
Persian Gulf War before Saddam Hussein was taken out. Do they want to
end terrorism or not? Half measures will never do it. U.S. foreign
policy is being hijacked by Hussein, who is bankrolling the latest
round of suicide bombings to divert attention from the effort to line
up support for another war against Iraq. The Bush clan allows him to
direct the world's focus.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Deluca</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When will Bush identify Israel as one of the most dangerous
terrorist countries today? Evidently, Sharon doesn't care about what
Bush thinks about the escalating war against the Palestinians. Let's
wake up and recognize that support of Israel is not in our best
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Israel is not our friend, we are Israel's friend--and there is a
difference between the two that we are seeing today. All Israel is
accomplishing with its violent choices is the cultivating of a new
generation of terrorists who will strike at our country in
retaliation for our blind support of Israeli "eye for an eye"
military policies. Enough is enough!</TE>

<LD>It appears "Their Homes in Your Park" (editorial, April 8) has it
backward and should have been titled "Your Park in Their Homes." As
indicated, those properties were owned by individuals before Congress
declared the surrounding areas for public parks. Now we condemn them
for wanting to use their own land. I object to the implication of
wrongdoing on their part.</LD>
<LD>   To consider that these owners should not be allowed to develop
these properties as they desire would be no different than the
government allowing The Times to own a newspaper but preventing it
from publishing. In most cases, private ownership within park
boundaries tends to have a very small impact. If Congress this time
decided to designate a public park in an area dominated by private
property, then we should reconsider the wisdom of such a move. And in
the end, if deemed imperative for public good, the law allows the
consideration of eminent domain.</LD>

<LD>Re "Pastoral Tax Break Faces Legal Test," April 6: USC law professor
Erwin Chemerinsky claims that failure to tax the housing or parsonage
allowance given to ministers by churches is an indirect subsidy of
religion and therefore unconstitutional. Further, that there is such
great need for the allowance is proof the government is subsidizing
religion and further evidence that the wall of separation between
church and state is being breached. However, if failure to tax is a
subsidy, then we are less than sharecroppers and less than serfs. We
are slaves, owning any income or property at all as a subsidy from
government.</LD>
<LD>   But the 1st Amendment also says that Congress shall make no law
prohibiting the free exercise of religion. If not taxing part of a
minister's income is a subsidy that breaches the wall between church
and state, does not such taxation by the same degree prohibit the
free exercise of religion?</LD>

<TE>   Because the wealthy Rev. Richard Warren has decided to try to
improve his own personal financial situation and take on the IRS, the
constitutionality of the parsonage allowance is being examined.
Without the tax benefit, many churches across the United States may
be forced to close their doors.</TE>
<TE>   In secular areas, the rich guy sometimes ruins things for the
little guy. I guess the same can be seen in religious circles.</TE>

<HD>Malcolm Kalp, 63; One of U.S. Hostages in Iran</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malcolm Kalp, an alleged CIA officer who was repeatedly beaten and
was kept in solitary confinement for most of the 444 days he was held
by militants in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis two decades
ago, has died. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Kalp died Sunday in Stoughton, Mass., when the truck he was
driving flipped over after it was hit by a car driven by what police
said was a drunk driver. Kalp died at the scene.</LD>
<LD>   The driver of the other vehicle, charged with vehicular homicide
and driving under the influence, pleaded not guilty to the charges in
court on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Kalp arrived in Tehran for his posting in the economic and
commercial section of the U.S. Embassy just three days before it was
seized by Islamic militants Nov. 4, 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Initially seeking the return of the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi, who was in the United States for cancer treatment, the
militants held 52 Americans for 444 days. The hostages were released
the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office as president.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the embassy's vital documents and almost all of
its sensitive communications equipment were destroyed by staffers as
militants stormed the compound, documents found in the office of
embassy charge d'affaires L. Bruce Laingen identified Kalp as one of
three CIA agents on station.</TE>
<TE>   It was that disclosure, and Kalp's apparent unwillingness to talk,
that led to his harsh treatment.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews after his release, Kalp said he was kept in 22
different cells and spent 374 days in solitary confinement. He said
he attempted to escape three times, once nearly succeeding by picking
a lock in his room.</TE>
<TE>   He said he spent seven straight days in handcuffs and was beaten
twice while bound.</TE>
<TE>   "I took several kicks in the head on three different occasions in
Iran," Kalp told the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, he complained of ringing in his ears that he
said stemmed from his beatings.</TE>
<TE>   Kalp was part of a group of 13 former hostages who attempted to
sue the Tehran government for $5 million each in damages. However, a
federal judge in Los Angeles threw out the lawsuit because President
Jimmy Carter, as part of a failed effort to negotiate the release of
the hostages, had signed an agreement with Iran pledging that no such
legal action would be taken.</TE>
<TE>   During the hostage crisis, though all kinds of information was
made available on the lives and families of most of the hostages,
little information turned up on Kalp. His wife at the time turned
down requests for interviews, and neighbors in Fairfax, Va., said
they didn't know much about him or his family.</TE>
<TE>   Some reports said he was born in Brooklyn, others Boston. He
reportedly served in U.S. Special Forces in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   After retiring in the late 1980s, Kalp reportedly lived in
Southern California for a time before returning to the Northeast.
According to the Boston Globe, he had been making a living selling
plumbing supplies in a flea market over the last few months. He was
apparently on his way to the flea market Sunday when the accident
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   When the U.S. lifted a ban on imports of Iranian nuts, caviar and
carpets in early 2000 in an effort to improve relations, Kalp was
less than enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   "Let them pay major sums of money to the 241 U.S. servicemen they
killed at the Marine barracks and the embassy people they killed in
Beirut and then I'd be more than happy to eat their nuts, eat their
caviar and lay on their rugs," Kalp told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his second wife and two children.</TE>

<LD>Dr. Joseph Russell Elkinton, 91, physician, author and veteran editor
of the Annals of Internal Medicine, died Saturday in a Concord,
Mass., hospital of unstated causes.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Moylou, Pa., Elkinton graduated from Haverford College
and Harvard Medical School and was a research fellow at Yale.</LD>
<LD>   A Quaker, he was interested in the relationship between religion
and science, and in 1948 founded the chemical section at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Although he was a respected scientist and taught and practiced
medicine, Elkinton was also accomplished in the literary arts. He
co-authored an important textbook, "Body Fluids," but also wrote the
books "The Quaker Heritage in Medicine," "Bird on a Rocking Chair"
and "Footnotes on the Sands of Time."</TE>
<TE>   Most notably, Elkinton from 1960 until his retirement in 1971 was
editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, the journal of the
American College of Physicians, which he helped make one of the
world's most influential medical publications.</TE>

<LD>John Hauberg, 85, art collector and benefactor who founded the
Pilchuck Glass School and served as president of the Seattle Art
Museum, died Friday in Seattle of a heart attack brought on by a
bacterial infection.</LD>
<LD>   Hauberg grew up in Rock Island, Ill., the son of John Hauberg Sr.,
who founded the city's Hauberg Indian Museum.</LD>
<LD>   After graduating from the University of Washington, the younger
Hauberg stayed in Seattle, where he became a civic leader and
philanthropist. He was Republican state finance chairman from 1955 to
1964, and helped found the Northwest Hardwoods Assn., the Child
Development and Mental Retardation Center and the former Foundation
for the Handicapped.</LD>
<TE>   In 1971, he founded the Pilchuck school on his family farm as a
summer project. An international faculty now teaches hot-glass
design, casting and engraving, stained-glass painting and glass
blowing. Hauberg filled his three homes with collections of
pre-Columbian art, Northwest Indian art and contemporary Northwest
art.</TE>
<TE>   The first chairman of the board of the Seattle Art Museum, Hauberg
in 1973 succeeded its founder, Richard Fuller, as president. During
his five-year tenure, he was a key player in securing the museum's
downtown location. To celebrate the downtown facility's opening in
1991, he donated more than 200 pieces of Northwest Coast Indian art;
it was considered one of the finest collections of its kind.</TE>

<LD>Luigi Luraschi, 96, Paramount Pictures executive for more than six
decades and a major supervisor of the studio's European productions,
died March 31 at home in Paris of causes related to old age.</LD>
<LD>   The multilingual Luraschi went to work for Paramount in New York
in 1929, and four years later came to Hollywood to set up an
international department to deal with the foreign press. By the 1960s
he was working in Europe, helping Dino de Laurentiis produce Italian-
and English-language films in Italy. In 1965, he went to Paris to
work with producer Paul Graetz on "Is Paris Burning?"</LD>
<LD>   Luraschi was transferred to Rome in 1967 as vice president for
international production for Paramount British Pictures, supervising
production and dubbing in France, Italy, Germany and Spain. Luraschi
retired and moved to Paris in 1994 at the age of 88.</LD>

<HD>B. Dworshak, 48; Led Press Services at Salt Lake Games</HD>

<LD>Bruce Dworshak, a man of uncommon gentility and humility who was a
leading expert in organizing and managing services for the press at
the Olympic Games and other large-scale sporting events, died
Tuesday. He was 48.</LD>
<LD>   Dworshak had appeared hale at the Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games,
where he served as director of press operations. Only a few people
knew he had been battling illness for months; he died at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   "Bruce achieved ... a much envied and appreciated reputation for
evenhandedness and fairness absent any interest whatsoever in
self-aggrandizement or self-promotion, a rare quality in today's
super-hyped media environment," said Rich Perelman, press chief at
the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Games, who was a longtime friend and
colleague.</LD>
<TE>   Dworshak's role in Salt Lake was emblematic of his professionalism
in the last two decades. He oversaw behind-the-scenes work, including
accreditation, accommodation and language services.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake Games were notable for the smooth operation of such
logistical concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Dworshak served as chief of press operations for the 1999 women's
World Cup and the 1994 World Cup. At the 1984 L.A. Games, Dworshak
managed the information services section--which, among other things,
operated the 600-seat main interview room.</TE>
<TE>   Born June 16, 1953, in Salem, Ore., Dworshak attended the
University of Oregon. He is survived by his parents, Mike and Agnes
Dworshak of Springfield, Ore., and three siblings.</TE>

<HD>Juana Carrillo, 104; Santa Ana Matriarch</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juana Carrillo, matriarch of Santa Ana's oldest Latino neighborhood,
where she lived for nearly 90 years, died Thursday. She was 104.</LD>
<LD>   Carrillo, who lived in the 400 block of East Central Avenue, was a
fixture in Santa Ana's Delhi area.</LD>
<LD>   "Even the children who didn't know her called her abuelita (little
grandmother)," her great-nephew Mel Sanchez said. Children from
Monroe Elementary School across the street often visited.</LD>
<TE>   "It was nothing for her to see 100 children and some of their
parents a day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many were attracted to her garden, containing aloe vera, bird of
paradise, avocado, tangerines and roses.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo came to California from Coahuila, Mexico, with her family
in 1914 in a hand-powered railroad car to escape the Mexican
Revolution, paying 2 cents to cross the border at El Paso.</TE>
<TE>   She worked as a fruit picker and cannery employee.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband died in 1968, but she stayed active, flying to visit
her niece in Hawaii, and even taking a bus trip alone at the age of
98 to visit relatives in Delano for Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   She drank two beers every night, always at room temperature,
relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   When she turned 100, community leaders honored her.</TE>
<TE>   "She would say, 'God is very large; that is why he gives me so
much life,'" Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   Carrillo is survived by Sanchez, his siblings, Juanita Sanchez and
Danny Sanchez Jr., and his mother, Gloria Rivera Sanchez, Carrillo's
niece.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing and rosary will be this afternoon from 4 to 8 p.m. at
Brown Colonial Mortuary in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral is scheduled for 8 a.m. Thursday at Our Lady of
Guadalupe Church Delhi.</TE>

<HD>Helen Noga, 88; Club Owner Made Johnny Mathis Into a Star</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Helen Noga, the feisty music industry player who discovered the young
Johnny Mathis and tough-mindedly developed his extraordinary singing
career, has died at the age of 88.</LD>
<LD>   Noga died Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of heart failure,
according to her publicist, Warren Cowan.</LD>
<LD>   In the mid-1950s, Noga and her husband, John [who died in 1999],
owned two San Francisco jazz clubs, the Black Hawk and the Downbeat.
The clubs attracted to their small stages many of the world's finest
jazz musicians, including Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis and Billie
Holiday.</LD>
<TE>   A San Francisco State sextet, fronted by a 19-year-old singer
named Johnny Mathis, was eager to try its chops in Sunday afternoon
jam sessions at the Black Hawk.</TE>
<TE>   Noga's ears perked up at Mathis' high-ranging voice, which would
soon weave itself into national consciousness with such recordings as
"Wonderful! Wonderful!" "It's Not for Me to Say," "Chances Are" and
"The Twelfth of Never."</TE>
<TE>   Noga immediately established herself as Mathis' manager, arranged
other club bookings and called George Avakian, head of jazz at
Columbia Records.</TE>
<TE>   Avakian heard Mathis sing a haunting version of "Tenderly" and, as
the legend goes, cabled his record company's home office: "Have found
phenomenal 19-year-old boy who could go all the way. Send blank
contracts."</TE>
<TE>   The Nogas sold their clubs and moved to Beverly Hills, where the
young singer lived with them from 1958 until he severed their
business relationship in 1964. During that time, Helen Noga launched
him, making certain he got the career-boosting attention he needed,
even if it meant dressing the non-tennis-playing Mathis in tennis
whites for photo shoots.</TE>
<TE>   Insisting on proper treatment for her protege, Noga refused to
sign a contract for Mathis with the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas unless
they allowed him to come and go through the front door--a privilege
denied earlier African American performers, including Nat "King"
Cole.</TE>
<TE>   After her decade of working with Mathis, Noga wrote a novel,
"Ayisha," published in 1972, the story of a love affair between a
Turkish Muslim and an Armenian Christian.</TE>
<TE>   In her long career, Noga also worked with Phil Spector to found
and fund Philly Records.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by a daughter, Beverly; a granddaughter and two
great-granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services are planned at 1 p.m. Friday at Forest Lawn
Memorial-Park in the Hollywood Hills.</TE>

<HD>Titanium Bats Mostly Marketing Tools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent decision by the National Federation of State High Schools
Assns. that allows baseball players to use titanium bats has amounted
to much ado about very little titanium.</LD>
<LD>   The "titanium" bats manufactured by Van Nuys-based Easton Sports
are actually aluminum bats with graphite cores containing thin
strands of titanium not much wider than a hair. The strands help
stabilize the bat's core but do not affect its performance, according
to Jim Darby, vice president of promotions for Easton Sports. Darby
acknowledged the titanium label is primarily a marketing tool.</LD>
<LD>   "No one is going to have an advantage with the titanium bat," said
Elliot Hopkins, baseball rules editor for the NFSHSA. "It still meets
the same criteria [as other types of bats]."</LD>
<TE>   The March 22 decision allowing the use of titanium bats that meet
the ball-exit-speed ratio performance standard merely expedited a
previous NFSHSA ruling that had paved the way for them to become
legal effective Jan. 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   There was some confusion earlier in the season because some
BESR-stamped bats also had the word "titanium" imprinted on their
shafts. Ken Allan, rules interpreter for the California Baseball
Umpires Assn., said there was one instance in which a double protest
was filed after a game because both teams had used titanium bats.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an issue for a while," Allan said. "But because the
National Federation resolved it quickly, it never got out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   Easton currently sells two models of titanium bats, the lemon-lime
colored Connexion Z-Core and the gold-colored Z-Core. The latter bat,
the company's most popular titanium model, is selling for $249 and
the former $169 at a sporting goods store in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo High catcher Justin Frash spent between $250 and $300
for a titanium bat in January, hoping it would add some pop to his
swing, but he could only use it in practice until the recent ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I was excited to use it in games," Frash said, "and then when I
used it, I was like, 'Forget this.' It doesn't have the pop like the
TPX [an aluminum bat manufactured by Louisville Slugger]."</TE>
<TE>   Several baseball officials have expressed concerns about an
increase in injuries resulting from line drives off titanium bats,
but experts say the BESR designation ensures that all bats meet the
same safety standards.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hopkins: "[A BESR-stamped bat] could be kryptonite and the
ball still won't come off it faster than 97 mph."</TE>

<HD>City Section Games to Resume</HD>
<DH>High school: Private vehicles, Saturday games will get
varsity playing despite drivers' strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City Section athletic directors voted 43-6 on Tuesday to resume
varsity competition as early as this weekend, even if it means using
privately owned vehicles for transportation until a school bus
drivers' strike is settled.</LD>
<LD>   The athletic directors, who convened at Hamilton High for an
emergency meeting to discuss their options in the face of the strike
by Laidlaw bus drivers, also voted to allow competition on Saturdays
when a limited number of non-Laidlaw buses will be available.</LD>
<LD>   The plan halts all junior varsity and freshman-sophomore
competitions during the strike. The section rules committee, which
meets Tuesday, is likely to waive a rule that prohibits moving
players between varsity and junior varsity teams.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not a normal situation and we are not going to try and
make it normal," City Section Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. "But
we've done what we can to at least get our varsity teams back on the
fields."</TE>
<TE>   City Section sports have been on hiatus since the strike began
April 1 because buses used to transport teams were not available.
District policy prohibits the use of private vehicles for
transporting athletic teams.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency plan will allow student athletes and their parents
to drive team members to competitions as long as each student signs a
waiver releasing the Los Angeles Unified School District and its
member schools of responsibility in case of an accident.</TE>
<TE>   But that is a cause of concern. Most lower-income students do not
own cars and those who do often drive without insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a big thing," said Sue Kamiyama, athletic director at Bell
High. "The district is not providing insurance so we have to try and
work out a plan with all the schools we have in our league."</TE>
<TE>   One option is to play on Saturdays when transportation is
available, but facilities become an issue. Many schools do not have
baseball or softball fields, or tennis courts, and must use public
parks, which aren't available on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   All games missed last week have been rescheduled. Competitions
scheduled for this week, including two highly anticipated baseball
games between Chatsworth and Woodland Hills El Camino Real, will not
be made up.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately that's the situation," said Chatsworth Athletic
Director Fluke Fluker. "It's not utopia, but it's as good as we can
get right now.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is to get kids playing. For some of them,
sports is their life. That's the reason they're in school in the
first place."</TE>

<HD>Return of Lakers' Sixth Man</HD>

<LD>It was a little bit after 5 p.m. Two hours before the sellout crowd
at Staples Center stood and cheered for half a minute and waved
cutouts with his face on them.</LD>
<LD>   Long before the eggs were coolin' or the jello was jigglin', the
butterflies were fluttering and the lozenge was settling.</LD>
<LD>   Chick Hearn was anxious about Tuesday night's broadcast of the
Lakers-Utah game. Imagine that.</LD>
<TE>   The man has called play-by-play for Laker games since 1961. But he
had not sat behind the microphone since Dec. 16. One hundred thirteen
days, a heart surgery, a hip replacement, and 56 days later, he was
at it again.</TE>
<TE>   Not just another broadcast.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's very nervous," Marge Hearn, his wife, said. "I think
the nervousness might affect his voice. I wish he'd just settle
down."</TE>
<TE>   His voice sounded low and scratchy during a brief pregame chat.
(And I do mean brief. First two, then four red-jacketed Staples
Center security guards surrounded his broadcast area to keep
well-meaning fans and reporters from talking to Chick and wearing out
his precious vocal cords).</TE>
<TE>   Hearn had a bright smile and the eyes of a 7-year-old at his first
Laker game. But the voice was barely audible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little down," he said while juggling a cough drop with his
tongue. "It'll be back up."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, it always is when the camera goes on. It's remarkable
that anyone in his 80s can be so enthusiastic about anything.</TE>
<TE>   But this is what Chick does.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves it," Marge said. "He might as well come back and give it
another shot."</TE>
<TE>   "This environment keeps him feeling young," Stu Lantz said.
"That's what he needs. He needs this environment. He needs to be
around Shaq and Rick and Kobe and all the guys. He feeds off of
that."</TE>
<TE>   In return, he's fed his "word's-eye view" to multiple generations
of Laker fans. His voice had become a constant sound of the game,
like the squeaking of sneakers on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the organization," Kobe Bryant said. "He's been here longer
than everybody. He's more a part of the Lakers than we are."</TE>
<TE>   Listening to Hearn's voice describe highlights while on hold
during calls to the Laker offices reminded me how much he was missed.
Seeing him back in his usual spot Tuesday night showed how much he
belongs there.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like dad's back home," said Sheron Bellio, producer for
the Lakers' pre- and postgame radio shows on KLAC.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a difficult year for the Laker icons. Shaquille
O'Neal, the centerpiece on the court, has been beset by bad toes, a
wrist injury and now indications that the anti-inflammatory medicine
he takes has affected his internal organs.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotta take it," O'Neal said of the medicine. "If I can't
take it, I can't play up to the level that I'm used to playing at."</TE>
<TE>   In Miami on Sunday, he said he had tests taken on his liver and
kidneys.</TE>
<TE>   "It came back OK," O'Neal said. " Not great, but it came back OK."</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's shootaround, he said: "Your [organs] are probably
great, because you probably don't take pain medicine. I've been
taking it for 10 years. There's really nothing to worry about. But
it's not like my son's, who has great kidneys."</TE>
<TE>   For a guy who constantly jokes about retiring in a couple of years
(he has been saying it for five years now), this could a reason to
seriously consider leaving early. But he said the potential organ
damage isn't scaring him off.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I don't see myself going for more than five years, so I
don't think about it," O'Neal said. "In the last two years, I've only
taken them when I've needed them. This year, I've needed them. Last
year I really didn't take them that much. I'm OK. I'm not worried
that."</TE>
<TE>   That should comfort Laker fans. But they'd better brace for life
without Chick Hearn.</TE>
<TE>   "I think next year will be his last year," Marge Hearn said. "I
mean, you can't go on forever. Everything comes to an end."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, everything. Even Hearn's streak of calling Laker games, which
reached 3,338 games before he had his heart valve replacement surgery
on Dec. 19.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to imagine Hearn withstanding the rigors of NBA
travel any longer. King play-by-play announcer Bob Miller thought
about that during a recent trip through customs at the Vancouver
airport, as he tried to imagine Hearn enduring the same delays and
hassles when the Lakers go to Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The decision should be strictly Hearn's. He earned that right, oh,
about 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The one development to come from Hearn's absence was the discovery
that Paul Sunderland is a capable replacement.</TE>
<TE>   "As I move aside--as I rightfully should--I'm really grateful to
the organization for giving me this opportunity," Sunderland said
Tuesday night as he returned to his role as the pregame host on Fox
Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Kobe loaned me his new Ferrari for four months."</TE>
<TE>   That's a good analogy, because Sunderland grew into his role like
a sports car accelerating onto the freeway. He was skilled enough
that NBC has used him for NBA broadcasts, but the radio side of
Hearn's simulcast duties was new to him. By the end of his stint he
was up to speed on radio keeping the listeners informed of the little
details and matching his pace with the flow of the game.</TE>
<TE>   He kept the seat warm for him only in the figurative sense.</TE>
<TE>   Out of deference to Hearn, Sunderland refused to sit in Chick's
actual chair at Staples Center, so it was put into storage until
Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Hearn brought back his favorite major appliance, too. With 8:40
left in the fourth quarter and the Lakers ahead by 28 points, Hearn
uttered the line every Laker fan loves to hear:</TE>
<TE>   "This game is in the refrigerator."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Rangers couldn't bail out John Rocker after his blown save
the way the Oakland Athletics did Billy Koch.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker blew his first save chance for Texas and Greg Myers'
run-scoring single in the 11th inning gave Koch and Oakland a 5-4
victory Tuesday night at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   "Pitchers like Billy and me, our game is not finesse and it takes
a little while for us to get our command," Rocker said. "It seems if
I sit for four or five days, I'm really rusty."</LD>
<TE>   Eric Chavez homered twice for Oakland, including a solo drive in
the 10th inning against Rudy Seanez. Texas rallied for one run
against Koch (2-0) in the bottom half, but the Rangers couldn't score
the winning run despite having the bases loaded and nobody out.</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Long led off the 11th with a single for Oakland, moved to
second on a bunt and scored on Myers' hit against Seanez (0-1). Koch
closed it out with a perfect 11th.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I let the team down," Koch said. "I also kept us in
it. Don't ask me how."</TE>
<TE>   Koch blew his second save for Oakland by giving up a four-pitch
walk to Rusty Greer with the bases loaded in the 10th. But he got out
of the jam by getting three consecutive grounders to second baseman
Frank Menechino.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Toronto 2--Mike Mussina gave up two hits in eight
innings and Rondell White hit a tiebreaking two-run home run in the
top of the eighth inning, and the Yankees won their seventh in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Raul Mondesi and Felipe Lopez hit home runs off Mussina (2-0), who
struck out 10 and walked one. Mariano Rivera earned his fourth save.</TE>
<TE>   Since their 10-3 opening-day loss at Baltimore, the Yankees have
given up only eight runs and are off to their best start since going
9-1 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Minnesota 4--Chuck Finley, who had to skip his first
start last week after a domestic dispute with his wife, pitched six
shutout innings at Cleveland and the Indians won their sixth in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   Milton Bradley hit a two-run home run, Ricky Gutierrez drove in
two runs and Matt Lawton hit a home run off Joe Mays (0-2).</TE>
<TE>   Finley (1-0) did not make his scheduled start April 3 at Anaheim
after his wife, actress Tawny Kitaen, was arrested for allegedly
assaulting him while the couple drove home. Kitaen was charged with
spousal abuse and battery.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 8, Detroit 2--Frank Thomas hit his 350th career home run
to spoil Luis Pujols' debut as manager of the host Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   There were only 11,833 tickets sold--and even fewer people showed
up--making it the smallest crowd in the two-plus seasons of Comerica
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Lee and Royce Clayton each drove in two runs, and Magglio
Ordonez hit three doubles and scored twice. Dan Wright (1-0) gave up
two runs and five hits in 71/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 8, Kansas City 4--Nomar Garciaparra and Manny Ramirez
homered for the Red Sox to back an encouraging outing from Tim
Wakefield at Boston. The Red Sox also got home runs from Jason
Varitek and Brian Daubach, who had three of Boston's 15 hits.</TE>
<TE>   Wakefield (1-0), pressed into a starting role because of injuries
to John Burkett and Dustin Hermanson, gave up five hits, struck out
four and walked none to earn his first victory as a starter since
Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay at Baltimore, ppd., rain--The game will be made up on

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Glaus returns to the Angel lineup tonight, and not a moment too
soon.</LD>
<LD>   Glaus, suspended for the last two games, has hit three home runs
this season. No one else on the team has hit one, a power outage that
grew increasingly apparent in Tuesday's 5-1 loss to the Seattle
Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners scored the decisive runs on a home run, not one hit
by a slugger such as Bret Boone or Edgar Martinez, but by the
Mariners' No. 9 hitter, Mark McLemore. With John Halama and three
relievers teaming on a four-hitter, Seattle extended its Edison Field
winning streak to 10 games before an announced crowd of 17,210.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels sure could use a home run from someone, from anyone,
besides Glaus. The only major league teams to hit fewer home runs so
far this season are the Kansas City Royals and Pittsburgh Pirates,
teams that do not fancy themselves contenders.</TE>
<TE>   "Our winning is not contingent on Troy Glaus being in the lineup
every day," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "If it is, we're in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "But these guys can hit. They haven't forgotten how to hit."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' earned-run average of 4.00 is the best in the American
League West, so pitching alone cannot win the division. Their batting
average of .218 is the worst.</TE>
<TE>   "You either come out of the gate firing or you come out cold.
We've come out of the gate cold, with the exception of Troy,"
outfielder Darin Erstad said. "Troy basically won two games for us in
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "But it will come together."</TE>
<TE>   They won two games in Texas, with Glaus homering once in a 3-1
victory and twice in a 6-3 victory. Otherwise, they're 1-4.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nine starters, six are batting under .250--Bengie Molina
(.238), Garret Anderson (.222), Erstad (.214), Adam Kennedy (.130),
Tim Salmon (.125) and Scott Spiezio (.125).</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia was in no mood to tip his cap to the opposing pitching.
Halama, the kind of soft-tossing left-hander that all too typically
bedevils the Angels, scattered four hits over six innings. The Angels
drew one walk and failed to work the count, with Halama throwing just
73 pitches and barely breaking a sweat.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a poor offensive performance," Scioscia said. "No way we
can sugarcoat that. We didn't put any pressure on him."</TE>
<TE>   Had the Angels not played little ball, they would have been shut
out. Jose Nieves, starting at third base in place of Glaus, doubled
to start the fifth inning. Kennedy sacrificed him to third, David
Eckstein followed with a sacrifice fly, and that was the extent of
the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier lost for the first time since July, though he pitched
one of his finest games since July.</TE>
<TE>   Appier did not lose in his final 12 starts for the New York Mets
last season. In his debut for the Angels, who acquired him for Mo
Vaughn in December, Appier received a no decision in a 7-5 victory
over the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   He took the loss Tuesday, but he deserved better. He and Halama
matched zeroes through four innings, and the Angels gave him a 1-0
lead in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   But Appier, who held the Mariners to one hit from the second
through the fifth innings, gave up two to start the sixth and gave up
the lead as well. Ben Davis doubled, and the Angels anticipated
McLemore might bunt. So Appier threw a high fastball, and McLemore
hit it out.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw a good anti-bunt pitch," Appier said. "He wound up
swinging, and he hit it real good."</TE>
<TE>   In all, Appier pitched seven innings, giving up five hits and only
those two runs while striking out six.</TE>
<TE>   He outlasted Halama, although Halama did nothing wrong. He turned
in six innings and turned over a 2-1 lead to the Seattle bullpen,
with Mariner Manager Lou Piniella following the victory script of
Jeff Nelson pitching the seventh, Arthur Rhodes the eighth and
Kazuhiro Sasaki the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly, the Angels' 30-year-old rookie, made his major
league debut in the eighth inning and struck out Jeff Cirillo before
giving up three runs in the ninth. Donnelly arrived in Anaheim after
a 10-year minor league career that included stops--in one year
alone--in Altoona, Pa.; Durham, N.C.; Nashua, N.H., and Syracuse,
N.Y.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Salmon Finally Finds Support</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels rallied around right fielder Tim Salmon on Tuesday, one
night after fans repeatedly booed him during a defeat in which he
failed to hit the ball out of the infield and the Seattle Mariners
scored the tying run on his error. Salmon is hitting .125 with three
hits and nine strikeouts in 24 at-bats.</LD>
<LD>   "I've seen Tim struggle for the first half and carry the team in
the second half," Darin Erstad said. "He's never been a fast starter.
I'm not concerned about him one bit."</LD>
<LD>   Salmon is not the only Angel off to a slow start, a circumstance
he and Erstad attributed in part to the challenge in maintaining the
timing of a swing during a week that included two days off and a
rainout. After six games, Salmon isn't worried that a slow start
heralds a season similar to his poor one last year, but he does not
fault the home fans for booing him.</LD>
<TE>   "They're responding to the play," he said. "You'd like to play
well enough that you don't hear that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon also struggled on defense last season, and a repeat
performance could force the Angels into a difficult decision. With
Salmon signed for three years beyond this one, the Angels probably
would not re-sign Brad Fullmer if they believed Salmon would
eventually move to designated hitter. That, team officials say, is an
issue far in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "He's still running well. His arm is still strong," Manager Mike
Scioscia said. "I think he's going to play a good right field."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closer Troy Percival, on the disabled list because of a strained
rib cage, threw lightly Tuesday and said he is "almost positive" he
can return April 18, the earliest day he can be activated. Angel
relievers walked five in the eighth and ninth innings Saturday and
gave up five runs in the seventh and eighth innings Monday, but
Percival said the bullpen can hold the fort until he returns, even
with some relievers working in unaccustomed roles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's when it's real prolonged that it becomes a problem," he
said. "This bullpen can handle it for as long as I'll be out."</TE>
<TE>   Percival sounded almost jealous of Al Levine, the primary closer
for now. Percival makes his living on the strikeout; Levine induces
ground balls and fly balls.</TE>
<TE>   "He can throw four pitches and be out of there," Percival said. "I
have to throw 25 and take half an hour to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy, who was reduced to platoon status
during the second half last season but who led the Angels with a .439
average during spring training, is hitting .130 in 23 at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to say it's early," he said, "but you don't want to be
saying it's early two to three weeks into the season."</TE>
<TE>   After the game, the Angels activated reliever Dennis Cook from the
disabled list and sent infielder Clay Bellinger to triple-A Salt
Lake.</TE>

<HD>Tigers Hire Pujols, Offer Alou a Job</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Detroit Tigers hired Luis Pujols as manager for the rest of the
season and fired two coaches Tuesday, one day after firing manager
Phil Garner and general manager Randy Smith.</LD>
<LD>   Detroit also offered former Montreal manager Felipe Alou a
three-year deal to spend at least one year as Pujols' bench coach,
with an option to be a special assistant for two years.</LD>
<LD>   Tiger President Dave Dombrowski, who assumed general manager
duties Monday, has orchestrated the two-day shake-up in the hopes of
reviving a franchise that hasn't had a winning season since 1993 and
opened the season with six consecutive losses.</LD>
<TE>   Alou, fired last season, worked with both Pujols and Dombrowski in
Montreal. Dombrowski was an Expo executive from 1986-91, one year
before Alou was promoted from coach to manager.</TE>
<TE>   Alou, 66, said he's considering the offer.</TE>
<TE>   Pujols was named interim manager Monday afternoon, and had a long
phone interview with Dombrowski after the Tigers' game against the
Chicago White Sox was postponed because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   Pujols, 46, is Detroit's fourth manager since Sparky Anderson's
17-season tenure ended in 1995. The Dominican Republic native is the
Tigers' first minority manager.</TE>
<TE>   "We had talked about managers, and we had some names, but we felt
that the person that gave us the best opportunity to win was Luis,"
Dombrowski said. "He knows the players and he has the best knowledge
of our organization."</TE>
<TE>   Pujols spent last season, his first in the Tigers' organization,
as manager at double-A Erie following his stint in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   He was a major league catcher in Houston (1977-83)--with Garner as
a teammate--Kansas City (1984) and Texas (1985).</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm prepared for the challenge," Pujols said. "I've spent
a lot of years in baseball, and I managed in double-A last year. I
know that's not the majors, but with all my years in the game, I
think I'm ready."</TE>
<TE>   Dombrowski, who joined the Tigers in November after serving as a
Florida Marlin executive from 1991-2001, fired pitching coach Dan
Warthen and third base coach Doug Mansolino on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Steve McCatty was promoted to pitching coach from a similar
position at double-A Erie. Juan Samuel, Detroit's first base coach,
shifts to third, and hitting coach Merv Rettenmund kept his job.</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Landestoy is the new first base coach, after working with
the organization as a roving infield instructor. Jeff Jones is now
the bullpen coach, after being the pitching coach at triple-A Toledo.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City Royal closer Roberto Hernandez will sit out another
three to four weeks because doctors are concerned that the inflamed
tendon in his right elbow might be torn.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez will not throw for 10 days to two weeks, Manager Tony
Muser said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anthony La Russa, the father of St. Louis Cardinal Manager Tony La
Russa, died of pneumonia at Tampa, Fla. He was 90.</TE>
<TE>   La Russa had visited his father several times during spring
training in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Third base coach Jose Oquendo and pitching coach Dave Duncan
managed the team against Milwaukee on Tuesday in La Russa's absence.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Braves placed right-hander Albie Lopez on the 15-day
disabled list because of a strained right groin.</TE>

<LD>Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post can't adjust to the fact that
Cal Ripken has retired: "Where's Cal? Anybody seen Cal? You can't
start a season without Cal.... Excuse me, Tony, you moron, Cal is no
longer playing. He retired.</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, just because somebody is no longer playing doesn't mean he's
retired. Patrick Ewing is no longer playing--but there he is sitting
on the Orlando Magic bench like a wax exhibit from Madame Tussaud's."</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: Who was the first foreign-born winner of the Masters?</LD>
<TE>   Tree shot: It has been reported that Cleveland Indian pitcher C.C.
Sabathia was a power hitter while playing for Vallejo (Calif.) High.
How powerful was he?</TE>
<TE>   His high school coach, Abe Hobbs, told the San Francisco
Chronicle: "There's a eucalyptus tree at our place, about 500 feet
from home plate. He reached it one time. Our vice principal still has
the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Try something now: Chuck Finley rejoined the Indians on Friday
after missing his first scheduled start after his wife, actress Tawny
Kitaen, was charged with spousal abuse for allegedly kicking and
scratching him in a car.</TE>
<TE>   Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg told the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Finley arrived at the clubhouse with his new bodyguard--Tonya
Harding."</TE>
<TE>   More Finley: Paul Giles in humormall.com: "Indians' catchers now
have four signs to flash Finley: fastball, curve, changeup and 'Look
out! It's your wife!'"</TE>
<TE>   Growing, growing: The Miami Herald reports that on March 20, the
day after a Swedish newspaper revealed that model Elin Nordegren was
the new girlfriend of Tiger Woods, an Internet search of her name
yielded four Web pages.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, that number had grown to 40.</TE>
<TE>   Did you know? Track &amp; Field News reports that Howard K. Smith, the
noted television and radio newsman who died at 87 on Feb. 15, was an
outstanding track athlete while competing for Tulane.</TE>
<TE>   He set the school record in the 120-yard high hurdles at 14.6

<TE>   New challenge: Mike Bianchi in the Orlando Sentinel on O.J.
Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.'s threat to sue NASCAR for
allegedly engaging in monopolistic business practices: "When Cochran
tries to play the race card this time, it will take on a whole new
meaning."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1982, 62,000 Indian fans showed up
for the season opener at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium despite a
game-time temperature of 38 with a wind-chill factor of 17.</TE>
<TE>   Tons of snow had to be removed from the field before the game.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Odom Has Surgery on Injured Wrist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forward Lamar Odom underwent surgery on his right wrist Tuesday and
will be sidelined for three months. Tony Daly, the Clippers' team
physician, performed the operation with wrist specialist Jerry Blatt.</LD>
<LD>   Odom was injured when he fell on his wrist Dec. 16 against the
Detroit Pistons. He played in the next three games but sat out three
before returning to action Jan. 2. The pain eventually forced him to
the injured list Jan. 24, and he spent the rest of the season there.</LD>
<LD>   Early in his layoff, he sprained his right ankle after landing on
a stray basketball while attempting a dunk.</LD>
<TE>   Odom, the team's leading scorer and rebounder in 2000-01 with
averages of 17.2 and 7.8, played in 29 games this season. He averaged
13.1 points and 6.1 rebounds. Odom also had an eight-game drug
suspension in November.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers missed the playoffs after losing seven of their last
nine games, falling from contention in the final two weeks of the
regular season. It was their worst losing stretch this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a bad spell at the wrong time," point guard Jeff McInnis
said. "We just came up short."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers still hope to record a .500 or better record,
however. They are 38-40, with home games Friday against Sacramento,
Saturday against Minnesota and Tuesday against Memphis. They conclude
the season April 17 against Golden State at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The last Clipper team to finish with a .500 record was the 1992-93
team that was 41-41. The 1991-92 team that had a 45-37 record is the
only other one to top the .500 mark since the franchise relocated
from San Diego before the 1984-85 season.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, that's our next goal," Coach Alvin Gentry said of a
.500 record. "We don't have to play under any pressure now."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were 31-51 last season, Gentry's first as coach, and
15-67 in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   The last team to improve from 15 victories to 40 or more in only
two seasons was the Houston Rockets in 1984-85.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry's prediction that it would take 45 victories or more to
qualify for the playoffs in the West appears to be on target,
although the Clippers' late fade enabled Seattle and Utah to clinch
postseason berths Monday with 44 and 42 victories, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-place Seattle has three games remaining and eighth-place
Utah has four, so the prediction Gentry made several weeks ago could
still prove to be accurate.</TE>

<DH>Westchester Won State Championship, but Many Local Coaches
Say Nike's Sponsorship Gives Comets Too Big of an Assist</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before the start of the season, when the Westchester High boys'
basketball team was ranked No. 1 in the nation, opposing coaches were
saying it.</LD>
<LD>   Westchester, with its top eight players all likely to earn college
scholarships, was so much better than the rest that it belonged in a
league of its own.</LD>
<LD>   Now that the season has ended with a state championship and a 32-2
record, many in the City basketball coaching ranks are still talking
about the Comets.</LD>
<TE>   They say Westchester has an edge--corporate sponsorship--that is
ruining the competitive balance of the playing court.</TE>
<TE>   "What you have is professional players in high school," said
Ronald Quiette, the boys' basketball coach at Los Angeles Jordan.
"Let them all play each other. Set up two leagues: The
semi-professional league, and the rest of us."</TE>
<TE>   Westchester and Santa Ana Mater Dei were among a select 15 teams
in the nation that sports apparel giant Nike outfitted for free this
season. For Westchester players, that meant an investment of more
than $15,000. From headbands to high-tops, each Comet player received
more than $1,300 in gear--including five pair of the newest
top-of-the-line shoes. And there is more.</TE>
<TE>   The team had its expenses to a prestigious holiday tournament in
Houston paid for by a Nike affiliate. The estimated cost of that
trip: $7,000. Westchester also played in three other out-of-state
events last season, trips worth about $20,000 that were paid for
almost entirely by organizers seeking a prominent headliner for their
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   Special associations such as the one between Westchester and Nike
concern high-ranking school sports administrators, who worry that the
lines of fair play are being erased.</TE>
<TE>   The California Interscholastic Federation, which governs athletic
competition for the state's 1,292 high schools, doesn't have rules
prohibiting such arrangements. But some might be coming in at least
one of its 10 sections.</TE>
<TE>   The director of the CIF's largest section said he is tired of
endorsement deals such as the ones between Nike and Westchester that
seem to allow continued success for "the privileged few."</TE>
<TE>   James Staunton, commissioner of the 522-school Southern Section,
said he thinks that restrictive legislation is a potential hot topic
for an April 25 meeting of athletic representatives, where voting
members from each of his section's 73 leagues will be in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing we can do would be to alter our bylaws to make it
impossible to do this, even if a district would accept it through
their policies," Staunton said. "If the time is right and the council
can craft a rule that can at least put a damper on this, I think it
would pass in a heartbeat."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Westchester is a member of the Los Angeles City
Section, any policy-making decision by the Southern Section is sure
to be considered by the CIF's other regional governing bodies.</TE>
<TE>   Staunton, a former high school principal, said Nike's
"selectivity" is what disturbs him. "It's not the product; it's how
they're doing it," he said. "It's run so contrary to what we're
trying to do with the kids. Their business decision interferes with
our attempts to try to provide a level playing field ... and to get
away from direct influence on kids."</TE>
<TE>   While most high school teams do car washes and bake sales to raise
funds for equipment, uniforms and travel, Westchester, a public
school, attracts all-star-caliber athletes from across the South Bay
and parts of Los Angeles. The players admit they have been at least
partially enticed by thousands of dollars in free apparel and paid
trips to national tournaments that are attended by hundreds of
college scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "People who don't play [for Westchester], they're like, 'Damn
you're lucky,'" said Scott Cutley, a starter for the Comets at
forward. "They see our shoes. They see us traveling. They say things
like, 'I'll sit on the end of the bench just to be a part of
everything.'"</TE>
<TE>   Some do. Jonathan Smith, a top player at Lawndale Leuzinger High,
transferred to Westchester before this season only to become an
end-of-the-bench reserve. But he doesn't regret his choice.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of exposure," he said. "At Leuzinger, we only
traveled to tournaments in the South Bay. At Westchester, we travel
everywhere. The shoes, they're nice too."</TE>
<TE>   And, he added, "We win a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Winning Tradition</TE>
<TE>   In the five years they have been partners with Nike, the Comets
have won four City Section championships and two state titles. Mater
Dei, the other school with full sponsorship, has won Southern Section
titles in 10 of the last 11 years.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfax, Crenshaw, Compton Dominguez, Bellflower St. John Bosco,
Santa Margarita, Santa Monica Crossroads and Glendora, which received
smaller Nike contributions--most often, shoes and equipment
bags--also are perennial powerhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester opponents think this is not a coincidence, although at
all of these schools it is hard to determine what arrived
first--success or Nike.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Nike's money and they can do whatever they want with it,
but it creates parity problems," Reseda Coach Mike Wagner said. "No
kid in his right mind is not going to want to go to Westchester,
where they get their shoes and sweats and bags."</TE>
<TE>   The result, Wagner said, was a season played to a nearly
predetermined climax. It is why a meeting of City Section coaches in
October was noticeably void of the usual preseason optimism.</TE>
<TE>   "Every coach in the room knew there was Westchester, Fairfax, and
then 58 other schools," Wagner said. "We all knew they'd play for the
City championship."</TE>
<TE>   They were right. Westchester defeated Fairfax for the City title
and then swept its way to the state Division I championship.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner isn't the only local coach who wishes Nike would share the
wealth.</TE>
<TE>   "Let them help all the schools, not just individual schools," said
Dave Uyeshima, coach at Hamilton High, which lost two games to
Westchester by a combined 109 points.</TE>
<TE>   Almost as aggravating to local coaches as the Comets' tie to Nike
is that Westchester's banner season came courtesy of 12 players all
hailing from places outside the school's primary attendance area.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that loose transfer rules, along with Nike's
sponsorship money, encouraged a collection of star athletes to
converge at Westchester, which is located within window-rattling
distance of Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Adams, the 6-foot-4 guard who was the Comets' best player,
is attending his third high school. He is from Inglewood, as are
starting point guard Ashanti Cook, sixth man Brandon Heath and
reserve Bobby Brown. The others come from Santa Monica, Hawthorne,
Torrance, Lawndale, Carson, Hancock Park and the Crenshaw district.</TE>
<TE>   Only one month into the season, four of the Comets' five seniors
had already signed letters of intent with major-college basketball
programs--Adams to Arizona, Cook to New Mexico, Heath to San Diego
State and Brandon Bowman to Georgetown. At least two others--juniors
Cutley and Trevor Ariza--are considered certain major-college
recruits for next season.</TE>
<TE>   "An all-star team," Wagner said. "There are college teams they
could beat."</TE>
<TE>   Past Penalties</TE>
<TE>   Three times in the last two years Westchester has been formally
accused of breaking City Section rules, and twice it has been
penalized. The Comets were slapped with a year's probation when Adams
played for the team in a 2000 summer tournament before his transfer
to the school was official, and 6-7 center Ashton Thomas was declared
ineligible for varsity competition this season because of an improper
transfer from Leuzinger.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester had two transfers in its title-winning starting lineup
this season--Adams and Bowman, a senior forward who transferred in as
a sophomore. Neither player says he was "recruited," although Adams
acknowledges a long friendship with Westchester assistant Marlon
Morton, whom he met 10 years ago while playing on the courts of St.
Andrews Park in South Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Fiege, commissioner of athletics for the 62 high schools
in the Los Angeles Unified School District, understands the
frustration of coaches who struggle to compete with the Comets, but
she stops well short of accusing Westchester of recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   "When there are transfer students that go to a school, you can't
jump to that first conclusion that they were recruited by people at
the school," she said.</TE>
<TE>   While critics say that a roster lacking a single player from the
school's neighborhood is evidence enough of recruiting, other coaches
defend Westchester's Ed Azzam and members of his staff by saying that
top players are sophisticated enough to know which teams are equipped
to offer them the most.</TE>
<TE>   The winning equation isn't complicated: Free gear + free travel =
talented players, and a team entices even more top players because of
the exposure it gets and the college recruiters it attracts.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam said coaches who complain about his team's partnership with
Nike are expressing "sour grapes" and "maybe a little jealousy."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the kids come to the school because we wear Nike or
we get this or that," he said. "Some people think they're going to
get exposure or free shoes. But I hope it's because we teach. I'd
like to think they come here because they get better and because they
want to go to a program where they have the opportunity to win."</TE>
<TE>   Some of his coaching colleagues remain unconvinced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when people say we'll give you three pairs of Nikes
and two sweatsuits and we'll go to Vegas or Houston or other places,"
said Travis Showalter, the recently resigned Leuzinger coach who lost
Smith and Thomas to the Comets before last season. "That's tough to
compete against. There's no way I [could] match up financially."</TE>
<TE>   Sonny Days</TE>
<TE>   Shoe companies such as Nike and competitors Adidas, And 1 and
Reebok, which also sponsor high school and youth basketball teams,
know they are in a position to be criticized for their ties to
teenage athletes. It's a calculated risk. Forming a bond with a top
high school player is potentially lucrative if that player one day
signs an NBA contract and becomes a star.</TE>
<TE>   Nike won't soon forget the image of Sonny Vaccaro, a former
consultant who left the company to become a prominent member of
Adidas, sitting with Kobe Bryant's family at the 1996 NBA draft. When
Bryant was selected with the 13th pick, he popped out of his chair
and embraced his family, then his friends, and then Vaccaro, with
whom he had formed a bond during his years at Philadelphia's Lower
Merion High.</TE>
<TE>   Two NBA championships with the Lakers later, Bryant still has a
contract with Adidas. His "Kobe Two" shoes hit stores in February.
Retail price: $130.</TE>
<TE>   Adidas, Nike's closest competitor, has a budget of about $250,000
to support partnerships with about 40 high schools nationwide, a
company source said.</TE>
<TE>   Nike won't divulge what it spends on its "grass roots basketball
operation"--its sponsorship of high school and age-group youth
teams--but industry experts estimate that in recent years it has
grown to $3 million to $4 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Dorado, the director of Nike's high school basketball
operation, believes it is money well spent, especially with so many
teenagers jumping directly to the NBA or into the starting lineups of
major colleges. That exposure may easily be worth $3-4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 150 high schools connected with Nike get free shoes,
T-shirts and balls or athletic bags for each player, donations that
are tied for the company's sales and marketing strategy rather than
charity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a for-profit company," Dorado said. "I was hired to make
sound business decisions, and that's what I do."</TE>
<TE>   Critics might howl, but one prominent sports marketing analyst
said Nike and other shoe companies "are just following the tenets of
capitalism. The strong survive and the good get better."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Burton, executive director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing
Center at the University of Oregon, said, "When we look at the
commercialism of youth athletics, we can't speak about total purity.
Corporations have been asked to fund and sponsor Little League teams
for 40 years. We're OK with it when it was the local Albertsons or
the barber shop."</TE>
<TE>   Dorado said Nike's deal with Westchester fits the company's
business philosophy of partnering with winners. "We're always going
to be associated with the best," Dorado said, "whether it be
Westchester or a gold-medal speedskater."</TE>
<TE>   Not Only Sports</TE>
<TE>   Local administrators have been grappling for a solution almost as
long as coaches have been grumbling about inequity.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Fiege said Nike sponsored the City Section basketball
championships a few years ago, but was turned down by district
officials when it expressed interest in expanding its contribution.
The reason: The television program "60 Minutes" had just broadcast
its October 1996 investigative piece on Nike and child labor.</TE>
<TE>   "It just didn't seem like the right fit at the time," Fiege said.</TE>
<TE>   Fiege said the CIF, and its individual sections, have occasionally
considered strictly regulating sports sponsorships, but decided
against it for a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you single out donations to athletic teams, what do you do
about the $25,000 worth of computers IBM gives to such and such a
school for their business department?" Fiege said. "Once you open
those doors to discussion, it's not as easy as one would think to
keep it to athletics. You're singling out athletes if you take a hard
line and single out Adidas or Nike, but then it's OK to accept IBM or
Coca-Cola. How can I sit here and say Coca-Cola is OK and Nike isn't?
It's murky."</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Canter, the LAUSD's board member from Westchester's area,
District 4, said that while she was proud of the Comets'
achievements, the team's Nike contract was an example of
"overabundance."</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, I'm happy to have attracted Nike's attention,"
she said. "On the other hand, I'd feel much more comfortable if Nike
would be looking at Westchester as a school, saying, 'What can we do
to help school [academic] achievement?' Academics is really the ball
we need to keep our eye on."</TE>
<TE>   Uyeshima, who recently completed his 18th season as Hamilton's
coach, said local administrators need to start looking at teams like
Westchester with a more critical eye.</TE>
<TE>   "Downtown, they don't care," he said, referring to Fiege and other
City Section officials. "They get a team that goes to the state
championship every year. It's frustrating. It seems like they have so
many schools and so many things going on, they can't look into it."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to calling for Nike to more equally distribute its
sponsorship riches, Uyeshima and others would like to see rules
instituted on transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of Control?</TE>
<TE>   From the local real estate agent who advertises in the football
program, to the car dealership that has a banner on the outfield
fence of the softball diamond, many high school sports programs have
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   But Marie Ishida, the CIF's executive director, said many schools
don't seem aware that there are established guidelines for accepting
corporate gifts.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried to address in our constitution and bylaws that the
school's district determines how to divvy up that stuff so that no
one group of kids gets all of it," she said. "I'm not sure how many
districts are doing that, however, or if they're necessarily aware
they should be doing that." One CIF rule stipulates that teams are
supposed to report single-source donations of $500 or more to an
administrative source--most often, the school principal.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester's basketball team easily surpassed that standard--per
player--but Principal Dana Perryman said the team had "established a
practice" with a previous principal and that she "didn't know that
much" about the Comets' association with Nike.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than tennis shoes, I don't know what else they gave them,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I trust Mr. Azzam and I trust Mr. [Brian] Henderson [athletic
director]. They care about the kids. I don't think they would do
anything to jeopardize them."</TE>
<TE>   Dave Goosen, whose Venice High teams never beat the Comets during
his five years as coach, said the Westchester administration's lack
of institutional control makes it culpable for what he says is
illegal recruiting by the basketball staff.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just willing to look the other way because when
Westchester wins a state title it's publicity for the school," said
Goosen, who resigned before the last season, in part because he was
tired of being overrun by his Nike-powered foes in the Western
League.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like we were going to war with sticks and stones, and
Westchester and Fairfax had machine guns," Goosen said.</TE>

<HD>Chance to Be a Comet Perks Everybody Up</HD>
<DH>Prep basketball: Free shoes are only part of the story when
Nike sponsors a team such as Westchester. There are trips and
exposure to major colleges as well.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ice sculpture was beginning to lose its luster, dripping into an
increasingly large puddle at the bottom of a large glass platter. But
its shape, a trademark quickly recognized throughout the world, was
still easily identifiable.</LD>
<LD>   A three-foot-long swoosh.</LD>
<LD>   The host of the Nike Academy Invitational, a high school
basketball tournament featuring some of the best boys' teams in the
nation, was throwing a party in the penthouse of a swank hotel in a
Houston suburb.</LD>
<TE>   Like the tournament, which ran from Dec. 27-29, the party was
invitation-only. College coaches and NBA scouts, their affiliations
sewn into signatures on the chest of their neatly pressed polo
shirts, nibbled the cheese and sipped the wine as they mingled with
high school coaches and, most importantly, the parents of players.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation, not surprisingly, was dominated by basketball.
While one group talked about what a fine fit Westchester High guard
Hassan Adams should be in the lineup for the University of Arizona
next season, another across the room was eagerly anticipating the
marquee matchup of the tournament: a championship game pitting
undefeated and No. 1-in-the-nation Westchester and undefeated and No.
2-in-the-nation Oak Hill Academy of Virginia, which would have a
56-game winning streak if it reached the title game.</TE>
<TE>   Four floors below, members of Westchester's team, some still
wearing their $200 Nike warmups and $160 Nike game shoes, cruised the
hallways of the 12th floor, swaggering as if they owned the place.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly they were being treated like royalty.</TE>
<TE>   In a hotel banquet room, with silver place settings and linen over
the tables, they had been fed fresh omelets for breakfast, given
their choice from a pasta bar for lunch, and served steak for dinner.
Their food, hotel rooms and airfare had been paid for. They were also
using complimentary rental vans and had the attention of an
ever-present local host.</TE>
<TE>   Although the accommodations in their four-star hotel were three to
a room, some of the players surmised that professional players
couldn't be treated much better.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good experience for us to go to Houston and get love
like that," Adams said. "Other teams don't have what we do, getting
all that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Most of his high school basketball-playing peers would certainly
agree. The vast majority of high school athletes never experience
out-of-state competition during their scholastic careers.</TE>
<TE>   For even top teams, one trip is a treat.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester's jet-setting squad is an exception because the Comets
this last season were fueled by the corporate might of Nike, the
world's No. 1 sports retailer.</TE>
<TE>   The team's travel itinerary--which took it to tournaments in Fort
Myers, Fla., Houston and Erie, Pa., as well as a one-game stop-over
in Trenton, N.J.--was only one example of the perks afforded players
who are talented enough to make the roster of one of the nation's
premier prep teams.</TE>
<TE>   George Raveling, once a well-known coach at Washington State and
USC, is now the local face of Nike. He's a consultant for the sneaker
giant that has endorsement deals with many of the winningest athletic
programs in the nation. Every once in a while, he stopped by a
Westchester practice or game to sneak a peek at the Comets, one of
the brightest jewels in Nike's display case.</TE>
<TE>   Raveling declined to be interviewed about Nike's relationship with
Westchester, but he didn't hesitate to chat up Comet players and
lobby Coach Ed Azzam's help in coaxing a couple of the team's top
performers--most notably Adams--to participate in Nike-sponsored
postseason events.</TE>
<TE>   Raveling never stayed long, but Nike's influence was ever-present.</TE>
<TE>   As they emerged from the Westchester locker room for their Dec. 5
season opener, passing under a three-foot by five-foot Nike banner,
white swoosh perfectly centered on a black background, each of the
Comets wore a pair of Nike Air Flightposite IIIs, white with red
trim. At the time, the shoes were being featured on the company's web
site. Retail cost for holiday shoppers: $160.</TE>
<TE>   For the Comets, they were free--the first of five pair Nike would
give each Westchester player over the course of the season, along
with warmups, practice jersey, game uniforms, sweats and equipment
bag.</TE>
<TE>   In return for its investment, Nike received as much exposure as it
could have dreamed. Westchester performed before several standing
room-only crowds, both on the road and at home, where their legion of
followers often included Clippers Darius Miles and Quentin
Richardson, along with prominent college coaches such as Arizona's
Lute Olson and Kansas' Roy Williams.</TE>
<TE>   The Comets were also the focus of the ESPN cable production
"Sidelines: L.A. Hoops," their words and expressions captured on boom
mikes and cameras.</TE>
<TE>   During the playoffs, the Comets took part in a promotional tie-in
with Nike's Vince Carter shoes, the Shox VC. Westchester received a
shipment of the shoes a few weeks before the championship and, by
design, wore them for the first time in a game for the City
championship against Fairfax on March 2. In the stands, fans waved
10-inch-by-12-inch placards with the Nike swoosh and a Shox VC
advertisement on one side and a big "Go Comets" on the other.</TE>
<TE>   The Shox VC, $160 retail, had hit store racks for the first time
earlier the same day. A few days later, Adams received an extra perk.</TE>
<TE>   As the Comets prepared for a second-round game of the state
playoffs, he showed up at practice wearing a pair of white Air Jordan
XVII shoes. The shoes, which come in a silver briefcase with a
CD-ROM, retail for $200. They weren't available in stores for another
three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Adams received the shoes because he was among the 23 players in
the nation invited to participate in the inaugural Jordan Brand
Capital Classic, a postseason all-star game to be played Thursday in
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as you're on a Nike team, you don't have to be one of
the nation's premier players to feel as if you're on a season-long
shopping spree.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Bowman, a senior headed for Georgetown, said the first
thing he noticed after transferring from Santa Monica High as a
sophomore was, "We got a lot more gear. I knew we'd get some, but I
didn't know it'd be that deep."</TE>
<TE>   Bowman was speaking while sitting with teammates in the bleachers
before a game when, as if on cue, a Nike representative appeared.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys like those shoes?" the rep asked. "They fittin' all
right? How about the uniforms?"</TE>
<TE>   Bowman and his teammates nodded in unison.</TE>
<TE>   "Love my uniform," he said. "I love it all."</TE>

<HD>What a Giant Difference a Week Makes for Nomo</HD>
<DH>Baseball: He shuts down San Francisco, and Orosco retires
Bonds on a key at-bat in eighth for 3-0 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants are no longer on pace to win 162 games, and
Barry Bonds is no longer on pace to hit a few hundred home runs.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger starter Hideo Nomo and reliever Jesse Orosco made sure of
that on a soggy Tuesday evening, Nomo throwing 72/3 shutout innings
and Orosco retiring Bonds on a dramatic eighth-inning groundout to
lead the Dodgers to a 3-0 victory before 40,706 in Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Green knocked in two runs with an RBI groundout in the first
inning and a solo home run in the eighth, helping the Dodgers extend
their win streak to four and hand the Giants their first loss after
opening with six victories, including three over the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   "I tell you what, that was exciting," Dodger left fielder Brian
Jordan said. "That's just what we needed, to send a message. They
swept us last week, and we settled down and played some good
baseball. People might start to see that the Dodgers have a good team
too."</TE>
<TE>   The victory did not come without a considerable amount of
hand-wringing and pacing by Manager Jim Tracy and pitching coach Jim
Colborn in the Dodger dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 3-0, Tsuyoshi Shinjo and David Bell singled with two
outs in the eighth off Nomo, bringing up Bonds, who entered with a
.538 average, five homers and 11 runs batted in and represented the
tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy summoned Orosco, the 44-year-old left-hander who had limited
Bonds to a .136 average (three for 22) in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Orosco fell behind in the count with two outside breaking pitches.
But instead of coming in with a straight fastball, Orosco came back
with a cut-fastball that swept off the outside corner and Bonds
grounded weakly to second. Eric Gagne pitched a scoreless ninth for
his second save in as many games.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of relaxing because I thought Hideo was going to get
out of the inning, but after a couple of hits, I had to get my game
face back on," said Orosco, who has given up only one home run to
Bonds, back in 1988. "Barry will get anyone's heart rate going. He's
such a great hitter he strikes fear into any pitcher, so I get really
aggressive against him and try to make tough pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo made quality pitches all night, extending a streak in which
Dodger starting pitchers have not given up a run in 271/3 innings
over four games.</TE>
<TE>   It was a stark contrast to the Japanese right-hander's first
start, when he was rocked for four runs on six hits and six walks in
three innings of last Wednesday's 12-0 loss to the Giants. It didn't
take an advanced degree in baseball management to pinpoint his
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we over-analyze things, but this was a case of ball
one, ball two," Tracy said. "Major league hitters narrow the scope
when they're hitting from 2-0 and 3-1 counts. The plate gets a lot
smaller for them. No major league pitcher is going to succeed doing
that."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo wasn't a picture of first-pitch efficiency; of the 29 batters
he faced Tuesday, Nomo threw first-pitch strikes to 14. But of the
102 pitches he threw, 65 were strikes, so he didn't run into as many
2-0 and 3-1 counts.</TE>
<TE>   That allowed Nomo to be more aggressive with his forkball, using
his sharp sinking pitch to keep the Giants off-balance. Though he
only struck out three, he avoided the fat parts of San Francisco's
bats.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference between my first game and [Tuesday] night is that
in my first game, I gave them lots of pitches that were easy to hit,"
Nomo said through an interpreter. "This game, I located the ball
well."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo breezed through four innings, giving up only one hit--Bonds'
first-inning single--but he ran into some serious trouble in the
fifth when the Giants loaded the bases.</TE>
<TE>   That set up an all-Japanese showdown between Nomo and Shinjo, a
matchup that piqued the interest of the dozens of Japanese media
members in a packed press box.</TE>
<TE>   So much for suspense. Shinjo slapped Nomo's first pitch to second
base for a routine out, ending the inning and preserving the Dodgers'
1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers added insurance runs in the seventh, when Mark
Grudzielanek doubled and scored on Dave Roberts' bloop single, and in
the eighth, when Green slammed his first homer of the season to
straight-away center.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a Shawn Green swing we saw a lot of a year ago," Tracy
said. "The ball gets hit and it just keeps going. You think he didn't
get enough of it, and then you realize he got enough of it, and then
some."</TE>

<HD>No Matter the Batter, It's an Inside Job for Perez</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Common sense dictates that a pitcher be extremely careful throwing to
Giant slugger Barry Bonds, but Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez, who
will start against San Francisco tonight, prefers a more head-on
approach to baseball's single-season home run king.</LD>
<LD>   "He might be the best player in baseball, but at the same time,
when I'm on the mound, there's no one better than me," said Perez,
who was acquired from Atlanta in the Gary Sheffield trade last
winter. "I'm not afraid of him. I'm not going to let him beat me. Any
time I face him, I won't be afraid to go inside. If I hit him, I hit
him. That's part of the game."</LD>
<LD>   That was a big part of Perez's game in his Dodger debut last
Thursday, and not only with Bonds. Perez, 23, put Giant shortstop
Rich Aurilia on his back with a high-and-tight fastball, he hit Bonds
on the right shoulder and first baseman J.T. Snow on the right elbow,
all in the sixth inning of San Francisco's 3-0 victory.</LD>
<TE>   Perez took the loss that night, but he was aggressive and
effective and he kept Bonds in the park after Bonds hit four home
runs in the first two games of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to send a message that I'm not afraid to pitch inside,"
Perez said. "In Atlanta, they always wanted me to throw outside,
outside, outside, but I have to pitch inside. My changeup is a good
pitch, but I have to set it up by going inside with my fastball. That
also sets up my back-door slider."</TE>
<TE>   Perez's approach will no doubt ruffle some feathers. Snow
exchanged angry words with Perez after getting hit last Thursday, but
he did not charge the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "If they stand too close to the plate, I have to get them out of
there," Perez said. "If they feel too comfortable, you have to do
something to get them off the plate."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants faced Perez only twice before last week's game, but
they couldn't help but notice his intimidation tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "The Braves make their money pitching away, and it worked well for
them, but maybe the Dodgers have a different theory," Aurilia said.
"It's evident [Perez] is trying to go inside. He threw up and in and
hit a couple guys. That's part of his game, and he has the stuff to
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy was asked Tuesday if Kazuhisa Ishii's
rocky spring training performance, when jittery nerves led to control
problems and a 12.96 spring earned-run average, was only a
smokescreen to give opponents the impression he wouldn't be that
dominant.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii threw 52/3 innings of two-hit, shutout ball, striking out
10, in his major-league debut Saturday night, leading the Dodgers to
a 9-2 win over Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "If he was laying in the weeds," Tracy said of Ishii, "it would be
comparable to Chief in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.' It's like
we didn't know he liked Juicy Fruit, and we didn't know he could
talk."</TE>

<HD>Managers Are Deep in Thought</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Bonds' torrid pace might make a walk seem like
the best strategy in unusual situations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Dodger Manager Jim Tracy leaned back in his office chair and watched
the familiar frustrating show on TV.</LD>
<LD>   While preparing for the opener of a three-game series against the
Colorado Rockies at Dodger Stadium on Friday, Tracy paused to watch
Barry Bonds bat with Rich Aurilia on first in the 10th inning, none
out and the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres tied, 1-1, at
Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   Padre Manager Bruce Bochy summoned left-hander Alan Embree to
challenge the left-handed slugger in a seemingly textbook move--but
Bonds is rewriting the book. As the future Hall of Famer circled the
bases after his walk-off home run gave the Giants a 3-1 victory,
Tracy shook his head because he had been down that road too.</LD>
<TE>   "On Day 2 of the season, [the Giants have] got runners on first
and third and nobody out and we gave up a three-run home run to him,"
said Tracy of Bonds, limited to a single in four at-bats Tuesday
night in a 3-0 Dodger victory here.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you do in the top of the first inning? Pitch around Barry
and load 'em up with nobody out? With anyone else, you're not even
entertaining the thought of walking him in that situation in the
first inning. But you know what? With this guy it starts popping in
there.</TE>
<TE>   "It starts popping in there about the time he rolls that doughnut
on the bat and swinging in the on-deck circle. It's very indicative
of the fact of how good this man makes the people around him. This
guy will put [managers] in a lot of situations to be second-guessed."</TE>
<TE>   The Padres would have put the potential winning run on second base
with none out had they walked Bonds on Friday. A good move?</TE>
<TE>   "If I were managing, I wouldn't pitch to him any time he could
hurt you," Dodger second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "Yeah, I
know you're talking about a lot of different situations he could hurt
you, but it doesn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're up by five runs or something like that, OK. If it's the
first inning or something like that, OK. But what he's doing right
now, what he's done since last season, definitely makes you look at
things differently than you normally would."</TE>
<TE>   Not that this is foreign territory to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time National League most valuable player has stirred
concern in opposing dugouts throughout his 16-year career. However,
Bonds increased the heat with last season's 73-homer, 177-walk
performance and his torrid start in 2002. He hit four homers to help
the Giants sweep the Dodgers in an opening three-game series and five
(in his first 13 at-bats) as the club started 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   Former Arizona Diamondback Manager Buck Showalter raised eyebrows
in 1998 when he walked Bonds with the bases loaded in a
regular-season game, but no one would be surprised by such a move
now.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing would surprise me at this point because of the zone he's
in, I just don't know if anything would have that much effect," Giant
General Manager Brian Sabean said. "It wouldn't be a surprise to see
him walk with nobody on, see him walk with the bases loaded and to
see [defensive] shifts. The problem is, whether it's a ball or
strike, he's got the knack for hitting the ball in the deep part of
the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "I also don't know if it would come down to any one bat in the
game. I don't know if [opposing teams] can say, 'This is the time we
can't let him beat us,' because he can end up beating you in the
first inning, in the third inning or whenever."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents agree.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the only guy in baseball who seems like he's a threat all
the time," Dodger right fielder Shawn Green said. "There are a lot of
guys who are threats but he ... he's a threat to hit a homer every
time he comes to the plate. He's already been walked with the bases
loaded once, so he definitely changes things."</TE>
<TE>   And that makes life easier for Giant Manager Dusty Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "On almost every roster, there's somebody over there that you say,
'We don't want this guy to beat us,'" he said. "Some teams have more
than one--I just happen to have probably the top guy."</TE>

<LD>Mighty Duck goalie Steve Shields hasn't played since suffering a
concussion April 3, and it's unclear whether Shields will play for
the Ducks next season. The development of Jean-Sebastien Giguere into
one of the top goalies in the NHL has relegated Shields to a back-up
role. Shields is paid $2 million, a bit pricey for a No. 2 goalie,
and will be a restricted free agent after the season.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   If defenseman Keith Carney, recovering from a deep cut on his
elbow, doesn't return to the lineup Friday against Colorado, the
Ducks likely will import defenseman Aris Brimanis from minor league
Cincinnati.</LD>
<TE>   Defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky is unlikely to play because of a

<DL></DL>
<LD>With 10 days left in Santa Anita's winter-spring meet, one thing is
certain.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Baffert will win his sixth consecutive training title at
Arcadia and seventh in the last eight years.</LD>
<LD>   Baffert has 40 victories through the first 75 days of the season,
12 more than his closest pursuer, Bill Spawr, and 15 more than Bobby
Frankel. Spawr was the last trainer other than Baffert to win a Santa
Anita title. He led the standings with 28 wins during the 1995-96
meet.</LD>
<TE>   With 207 starters, Baffert has run 55 more horses than Spawr and
84 more than Frankel, and he'll add to that figure today when he
sends out Skip To The Stone and Bay Head King in the second race.</TE>
<TE>   An optional claimer at a mile on the dirt, the race drew only
three other entrants and all of the participants have something in
common. They are winless in 2002, having combined to go 0 for 8.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old son of Skip Trial, Skip To The Stone is 0 for 2 since
joining the Baffert barn and has lost four in a row since winning the
Bay Shore a year ago at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Running without blinkers for the first time since his second start
on Jan. 20, 2001, Skip To The Stone is the likely pacesetter and will
be ridden for the first time by Patrick Valenzuela.</TE>
<TE>   Bay Head King is also 0 for 2 for Baffert and is winless in his
last five. His third and most recent victory came July 18 at Belmont
Park. He could be closest to his stablemate early.</TE>
<TE>   The other three starters in the field are Most Likely, winless in
his last 12 since the beginning of 2001; Kachamandi, who is 0 for 2
since coming to the United States from South America, and Dig For It,
who is 0 for 2 in 2002 and only one for 21 in his career at Santa
Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Victory Ride, one of the top 3-year-old fillies
in the country last year, will make her first start of the year in
the $100,000-added Madison Stakes at Keeneland. The seven-furlong
race is the eighth on the card.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jason Lumpkins. The jockey got off to a good start at
Bay Meadows. After five days of racing, he is on top of the standings
with seven wins.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Jockey Adalberto Lopez. He is off to an 0-for-18
beginning at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Bright Sunday in the
fifth, using Golden Spin and Mada Moon in the sixth, Nick Of Time,
Honesty Pays and Painted Avenue in the seventh and Leather Tough,
Willie Cruise and Hasta Lavista Baby in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet Total: 4/209. Money: Previous day/meet
Total: $17/$1,214.40. Total money bet: $1,290.</TE>

<HD>No Empty Gesture by Smolinski</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings were delighted when Bryan Smolinski ended his career-long
30-game goal-scoring drought Monday night, even if it was with an
empty-net goal.</LD>
<LD>   Not that they were dissatisfied with his overall play before then.</LD>
<LD>   "We think Bryan's still doing some effective things for us or he
wouldn't be in the lineup," Coach Andy Murray said before the Kings'
3-0 victory over the Dallas Stars. "We still have the belief system
in him because he's doing other things."</LD>
<TE>   Smolinski consistently scores high, Murray said, in the team's
efficiency ratings, a system in which points are awarded for
activities such as hits, blocked shots and shots on net, as well as
for goals and assists.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there was a period during this drought ... where it was
affecting other parts of his game," Murray said, "and there were a
couple of discussions we had where, as a coach, I indicated there are
only certain levers you can pull, and one is to limit ice time. The
other is to not allow the player to play.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't want those alternatives to be considered, so he got his
game going again in certain other areas."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Smolinski's name is showing up in the scoring summary too,
indicating that his slump may have ended. He also had an assist
Monday, giving him five points in four games after he had registered
none in 13.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy also had a goal and an assist against the Stars, his
fourth multi-point effort in five games.... Adam Deadmarsh's
game-winning goal was his fifth, tied with Palffy for the team lead.
Steve Heinze is third with four.... Jason Allison's assist was his
ninth point in five games.... The Kings' victory Monday was their
ninth in a row and 11th in 13 games at Staples Center against teams
that had played at Anaheim the night before. The Mighty Ducks are
3-2-0-1 against teams that played at Staples Center the previous
night. "It makes a big difference," King defenseman Mathieu Schneider
said of the schedule advantage.</TE>

<HD>Still the Kings' Crown Jewel</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Twenty years later, Miracle on Manchester is
franchise's fondest memory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viewed through the prism of time and a grainy videotape, the Kings'
1982 "Miracle on Manchester" playoff comeback seems even more
miraculous two decades later.</LD>
<LD>   Happy to squeeze into the playoffs after a terrible season, the
Kings redeemed themselves when a two-goal, two-assist performance by
21-year-old rookie Daryl Evans led them to a 10-8 upset of the
Edmonton Oilers in the opener of their best-of-five series. They
played well in Game 2, but a stinging 3-2 overtime loss figured to be
their last gasp of the 1982 playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The Oilers, after all, were young, swift and skillful and had
racked up 111 points that season, 48 more than the Kings. Dodging
defenders as if they were table-hockey figurines, the Oilers built a
5-0 lead after two periods of Game 3 at the Forum.</LD>
<TE>   Boos from the fans ushered the Kings off the ice. Boos from the
Oilers, led by the taunts of tough guy Dave Lumley, greeted them when
they returned.</TE>
<TE>   "The feeling was, 'Let's not make it 10-0,'" said Jim Fox, then
another young King forward. "We really worried about getting
embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   Owner Jerry Buss left during the third period. Some King veterans,
soured by past playoff failures, probably wanted to join him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like we had two teams," Evans said. "The old guys
were a beaten bunch. They realized what a good team it was playing
against us, and we really hadn't. We were willing to go in and give
it our best shot and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Their best shot became the Miracle on Manchester, a 6-5 victory
capped by Evans' goal 2:35 into overtime 20 years ago today. He
couldn't know then his NHL career would be brief, or that goal would
be its pinnacle. Or that he would be asked about it nearly every day,
and become the custodian of the Kings' most cherished memory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing to me, the impact of one goal," said Evans, who does
radio color commentary for the Kings and oversees hockey programs at
their El Segundo training center. "It makes people believe anything
really can happen."</TE>
<TE>   It was David beating Goliath, with a wrist shot instead of a
slingshot.</TE>
<TE>   "We were outclassed, out-talented, out-everythinged," said Charlie
Simmer, who played with Dave Taylor and Marcel Dionne on the Kings'
Triple Crown line.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys didn't quit. There was a lot of pride at stake and a lot
of talking, a lot of, 'We'll see you guys later.' It was an example
of the little guy that worked hard and was able to come away with the
victory."</TE>
<TE>   History has added weight to their feat. Two years later the
Oilers, with largely the same team, began a run of five Stanley Cup
titles in seven years. The Kings missed the playoffs the next two
seasons and have gotten beyond the third round of the playoffs once
in 34 seasons, losing the 1993 Stanley Cup finals to Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the biggest learning experiences we had," said
Kevin Lowe, then an Oiler defenseman and now the team's general
manager. "If we hadn't lost that series, I don't think we would have
gone on to do what we did."</TE>
<TE>   Eager for a goal or two to salvage self-respect, the Kings gambled
on offense in the third period and gave up a parade of scoring
chances. Brent Hughes hit the post once and was foiled on breakaways
twice; Wayne Gretzky shot wide on a solo chance. "If we'd scored,
that would have broken their backs," Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings finally solved goalie Grant Fuhr at 2:46 of the third
period, when Jay Wells used Taylor as a screen on a shot from the
right side. Doug Smith converted a power-play rebound at 5:58, and
Simmer banked a shot home at 14:38 to make it 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Their big break came when Garry Unger high-sticked King captain
Dave Lewis at the 15-minute mark and drew a five-minute penalty.
Lewis got a minor, leaving the teams four-on-four when Mark Hardy
took a pass from Steve Bozek and rifled a shot past Fuhr from the top
of the slot at 15:59.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, the Oilers weren't so cocky anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we were really worried until it was 5-4," Lowe
said, "and then, it was more disappointment and, 'How dumb can we be
to let a team back in it?'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "I don't think winning was even on our minds until it
was 5-3. When you're down, 5-0, you're thinking about the rest of the
series and making them think you're a worthy opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Pressing for the tying goal, King Coach Don Perry pulled goalie
Mario Lessard in favor of a sixth attacker, an energetic and rested
Fox. Dashing off the bench toward Gretzky, who had the puck near the
boards, Fox startled the game's premier player and stole the puck.
After a scramble and a shot by Hardy, Bozek prodded it in with five
seconds remaining in the period.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he was expecting body contact," Fox said of Gretzky. "I
just went at the puck and poked it. I knew how much time was left. It
was all or nothing."</TE>
<TE>   No one was happier than Evans, who had gone to the locker room
after getting a 10-minute misconduct in a brawl at 10:04 of the third
period. He listened to the radio and hoped for the impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember going in and guys started getting undressed," he said.
"I was thinking, 'Hang tight.' Guys were saying, 'Get your stuff
off,' but I was saying and thinking, 'Hang tight.'</TE>
<TE>   "The last minute seemed like it took forever. Gretz had the puck
and Foxy poked it away, and the next thing you know the shot went
back to the point and Bozek tips it in. It was, 'Wow. It happened.'
You almost go into shock there for a minute in the locker room and
then you think, 'I'm going to get a chance to play again.'"</TE>
<TE>   They almost wasted the chance when Lessard left his crease to
chase a loose puck and Mark Messier sent a backhander wide of the
empty net 27 seconds into overtime. But they hung on, getting a
faceoff in Edmonton's end after Fuhr gloved a long, knuckling shot by
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Messier and Smith lined up in the right circle, with Evans, a
left-handed shooter, stationed at the right-wing boards. Smith won
the faceoff and lifted Messier's stick, allowing Evans to pounce on
the puck and rip a shot in the sliver of daylight between the
grappling bodies of Smith and Messier.</TE>
<TE>   The Forum went wild as the Kings, in garish gold, piled on Evans
and slid into the end boards in a happy heap. "After watching it over
and over I still say, 'How did it go in?'" he said. "I remember
coming out to be introduced as the first star and the ice was covered
with garbage. People had thrown all kinds of things. But I never
touched a piece. It was like I was skating on air."</TE>
<TE>   The euphoria was fleeting. The Kings lost Game 4 at home, 3-2, and
won the series with a 7-4 rout at Edmonton but lost to the Vancouver
Canucks in five games in the next round. They didn't win another
playoff series until 1989, when they upset the defending champion
Oilers. By then, Gretzky had been traded to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "They definitely matured after that year and focused on being a
great team instead of being brash," Simmer said of the Oilers. "We
won the game and the series, but they won five Stanley Cups. For us,
in our little world, it was a big victory, but we didn't go anyplace
after that."</TE>
<TE>   Hardy also is rueful. "It was a great thing for this organization,
and it's something you can look back and say you'll never forget," he
said, "but I sure would have liked to have had one of those Stanley
Cup rings."</TE>
<TE>   Evans too regrets what he and the Kings never did. But he has come
to terms with it, appreciating the magic of his one great moment 20
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel fortunate to have been part of a game that people remember
a great number of years later," he said. "I didn't accomplish all I
wanted to accomplish playing. But the short time I did put in, I
wouldn't change a thing."</TE>

<HD>Koivu's Return Sparks Canadiens</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Center resumes playing after battling cancer and
Montreal clinches a spot in the playoffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>The Montreal Canadiens welcomed back Saku Koivu and capped an already
emotional night by clinching a playoff berth.</LD>
<LD>   Seven months after he was diagnosed with abdominal cancer,
Koivu--Montreal's captain--resumed his playing career as the
Canadiens scored three second-period goals and held on for a 4-3
victory over the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday night to secure their
first playoff appearance in four seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Koivu, who had aggressive chemotherapy treatments to combat the
disease, was greeted with a standing ovation that lasted eight
minutes from the time he stepped on the ice until the opening
faceoff.</LD>
<TE>   "It was overwhelming," Koivu said. "I really appreciated what
happened there."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd got plenty more to cheer about early in the second
period as Andreas Dackell and Craig Rivet scored 54 seconds apart and
Richard Zednik scored his 22nd goal at 14:25 to put Montreal ahead,
3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Rivet bolted directly to the Canadiens' bench to hug Koivu after
his slap shot got past Patrick Lalime at 4:52.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great feeling for me to see him so happy," said Rivet,
who visited Koivu in his hospital room moments after he got his
shocking diagnosis in September. "It was a great moment for me."</TE>
<TE>   Jani Hurme replaced Lalime in the Senators' goal to begin the
third period and Shawn McEachern scored 34 seconds into the period,
pulling Ottawa within 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Yanic Perreault brought the crowd to its feet again at 4:45 when
he beat Hurme for his 27th goal to restore the Canadiens' three-goal
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "After we had the 4-1 lead, we thought we had it for sure, but
they came right back at us," Perreault said.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa's Chris Neil made it 4-2 with his 10th goal at 7:07 and
Marian Hossa cut the Canadiens' lead to one 16 seconds later with his
30th goal, an unassisted effort at 7:23.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal clung tenaciously to the eighth and final playoff spot in
the Eastern Conference down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We're really happy," goalie Jose Theodore said. "We didn't want
to wait until the last game to see what's going to happen, so we're
happy now that we're in. It's a big relief."</TE>
<TE>   Koivu, who did not record any points in the game, was given his
first standing ovation when his arrival on the ice for warmups
brought the 8,000 or so fans on hand out of their seats.</TE>
<TE>   Four minutes before the Canadiens took the ice, the crowd chanted
"Saku! Saku! Saku!" The cheers grew as the video scoreboard showed
the Canadiens preparing to leave their dressing room, and the sound
of their applause rose to a crescendo as the last player--Koivu--took
the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Even members of the Senators looked on and tapped their sticks on
the ice as Koivu took his first few turns around the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "It was emotional for everyone on the ice," said Ottawa forward
Benoit Brunet, who began the season with Montreal. "I was happy he
played. He looked pretty good, too."</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Fisher Determined to Challenge Defense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Fisher went into Tuesday's game shooting a career-best 40.2%
from the three-point arc, 20th in the NBA and up from last season's
39.7%. He had made 35% in his career.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time, however, Fisher is going to the basket a few
times a game. Though his success rate is low--he never gets a foul
call and often has his shot blocked--Fisher said he's not stopping
now.</LD>
<LD>   "That's very important," he said. "Even if those shots don't go
in, they're still a part of my game. If I go to the hole two or three
or four times, just getting the feel of the ball sometimes helps me
stay in rhythm."</LD>
<TE>   In the final week of the regular season, Coach Phil Jackson is
feeling for a point-guard rotation, a mix of Fisher, Lindsey Hunter
and Brian Shaw. Even so, Kobe Bryant often handles the ball,
particularly against pressing teams.</TE>
<TE>   So, Fisher sometimes plays most of the fourth quarter and
sometimes plays none of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's comfortable waiting until there are five, four or
three minutes to go, that he has the confidence that I'll be able to
control the tempo of the game," Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he's leaned toward Hunter when he needs a quicker
defender.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Lindsey playing small guards," Jackson said. "I like him
tracking guys coming off screens and chasing through picks, those
type of things. Not so much having to do with the lead guard role as
much as defensively."</TE>
<TE>   The most-valuable-player ballots are out and due in 10 days,
leading Shaquille O'Neal to think back to his glorious 1999-2000
season, when he won his MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, an [idiot] [messed] around and [messed] up history," he
said. "Print that."</TE>
<TE>   CNN's Fred Hickman voted for Allen Iverson, standing between
O'Neal and the first unanimous MVP selection.</TE>
<TE>   With five games left in the regular season and O'Neal taking
treatment on a sprained wrist and arthritic toe, Jackson was asked
what he expected of his center in the final days.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty points, 15 rebounds, five blocks a game," he said. "That's
what we need."</TE>
<TE>   Is that realistic?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why it isn't," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, on the competitiveness of the Western Conference
playoffs: "The way the balance is in the first six teams--I'm not
going to count on Seattle or Utah--anybody can get bumped off in the
first round."</TE>

<HD>Just Call It Masterful by Bryant</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: He dazzles crowd and Jazz after O'Neal is
ejected, finishing with 22 points in 112-82 Laker rout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were moments Tuesday night of pure Kobe Bryant, when he was the
most athletic man on the floor, on any floor, and when his creativity
and ferocity unhinged every jaw in a town unjaded by two other
generations of basketball greatness.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers beat the Utah Jazz, 112-82, at Staples Center, where
Chick Hearn was on the air and Bryant was in it, particularly in the
third quarter, in the moments after Shaquille O'Neal was ejected.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant scored 22 points. Just 22, of 112.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, though, his scoring was as much to do with how as
with how many. He jumped over the aging Jazz, and through it. He
floated short jumpers and lined turn-arounds, and he went to the rim
so hard that two Jazz players, three of them, often weren't enough.</TE>
<TE>   "He pulled some stuff out tonight we hadn't seen for a while,"
Laker guard Brian Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was assessed two technical fouls in a two-minute, 32-second
span of the third quarter, the first for something he said, the
second for something he slammed off the face of Jarron Collins. His
elbow. The intent, on a rebound of his own miss, was debatable, but
the ejection was not. He left with 22 points and three rebounds, the
Lakers holding a 68-62 lead, and apparently shrinking.</TE>
<TE>   "A terrible call," Laker Coach Phil Jackson called it.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz didn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   "It was probably out of frustration," Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   The Jazz was pulling momentum from its jump shots and John
Stockton's energy and O'Neal's slow walk off the floor, through the
tunnel, into the locker room and into the night. He left without
speaking to reporters again, and left the game to Bryant and the
rest, to the usual Shaq-less formula.</TE>
<TE>   "We just executed our game plan," Bryant said. "It wasn't anything
extremely emotional."</TE>
<TE>   Not for him, maybe. But he caused the crowd to gasp at how dynamic
he could be, at how much better he was than the other nine.</TE>
<TE>   As the Lakers began to pull away, Bryant drove from the left side,
flung himself to the basket, stopped himself in midair, and flipped
in a layup through six arms. Lakers, 83-69.</TE>
<TE>   And, in case the Jazz had any ideas about the fourth quarter,
Bryant raced the third-quarter clock to zero. He dashed down the
right side on a fastbreak, leaped to gather a long, overthrown pass
from Robert Horry and even bobbled the ball, then rose to shoot from
the baseline, from 14 feet. Over the fingertips of DeShawn Stevenson,
Bryant twisted upward and hit the shot at the buzzer. Bryant stared
at the crowd, then at his teammates, and then left for the night.
Lakers, 87-70.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz, gone. It was outscored, 44-20, after O'Neal was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we looked like a bunch of guys that didn't even like
playing basketball," Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan said. "They just blitzed
us about every way they could. Kobe Bryant was terrific in that
stretch."</TE>
<TE>   Before that, when the Jazz and O'Neal were still around, Bryant
had a vicious reverse dunk, perhaps his best of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a gift," Jackson said of Bryant's third-quarter rush.
"Being able to step into moments of basketball and play at a certain
level, where the game comes to you. And you're able to control all
the stuff that goes on in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant made three shots in the quarter, all with startling grace.
He preferred the dunk.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while there," he said, "I had thought I was getting pretty
old."</TE>
<TE>   All in all, however, there are the nights when O'Neal and Bryant
are overkill, when the system is plenty. Horry scored 14 points and
took 11 rebounds. Derek Fisher scored 14. Devean George had 16 and
four steals. Samaki Walker had 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   They defended the pick-and-roll--a specialty of the Jazz and the
bane of the Lakers--and they shot true (55.3% from the field) and
they wasted little effort. The Jazz shot 32.1%. As a result, the
Lakers won their 55th game, one fewer than last season, with four
games to play.</TE>
<TE>   It appears the Lakers will finish behind the Sacramento Kings in
the Pacific Division and Western Conference, but they seem to have
some interest in taking the third seed into the playoffs. So, they
lately have played some defense (they have not allowed 100 points in
two weeks), none tougher than in the first half against the Jazz.</TE>

<HD>All Duval Needs Now Is New Ending</HD>
<DH>Golf: He has come close the last four years at Augusta, but
he says experience will help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>He is the author of the unofficial book on how to lose the Masters
(Greg Norman owns the official rights, of course) and it is clear
that David Duval has written a sad tale. It is full of tragedy,
unfulfilled promise, broken dreams and plain bad luck. Yes, the usual
golf stuff.</LD>
<LD>   Check the reviews from his last four works:</LD>
<LD>   "Duval in 1998--'Heart-Wrenching'"</LD>
<TE>   Duval has a three-shot lead with three holes to go, but makes a
bogey at the 16th, Mark O'Meara gets a birdie at the 18th and Duval
is forced to settle for a tie for second even though he closes with a
67.</TE>
<TE>   "Duval in 1999--'Dream Weeper'"</TE>
<TE>   Within one shot of the lead, Duval knocks his approach shot into
the pond at No. 11, makes a double bogey and ties for sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "Duval in 2000--'Cry Me a Rae's Creek'"</TE>
<TE>   Tied for the lead at the 13th hole, Duval can't decide between a
five-iron and a six-iron, goes with the five-iron and knocks his ball
into the creek in front of the green. He ties for third.</TE>
<TE>   "Duval in 2001--'Bye Bye Birdies'"</TE>
<TE>   Tied for the lead after 15 holes, Duval three-putts the 16th for a
bogey, then misses an eight-foot birdie putt at the 17th and a
six-foot birdie putt at the 18th and is second even though he closes
with a 67 again.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make Duval wonder if he's allergic to dogwood. But
with the Masters beginning Thursday at Augusta National, Duval seems
far from tortured about his past Masters experiences. In fact, he was
relaxed, confident and even semi-funny before he played his practice
round Tuesday morning with Arnold Palmer and amateur Robert Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, I've kind of run the gamut," Duval said. "I'm expecting
some really good things this week. I think the thing that benefits
the most is I know exactly what it feels like. I know how Sunday
afternoon, how my body is going to react, what my emotions will be,
and I think that can only help."</TE>
<TE>   In his last four Masters, Duval is a combined 31 under par and
whatever his emotions tell him after posting two seconds, a third and
a sixth, it's possible they might tell him he's ready to win it this
time.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Tiger Woods said he knows just what Duval has
lacked at the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "Luck," Woods said. "I'm not joking. You can't afford to make
mistakes down the stretch, but you've got to have some luck.</TE>
<TE>   "David has put himself in position and either other players have
beaten him or he made a couple of mistakes here and there. That's
just the nature of the game, but the key is to keep putting yourself
there. And if he [does], he'll get his green jackets."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, Duval would settle for one jacket. To acquire one,
Duval says the most important lesson he has learned about being in
contention Sunday at the Masters is to control his nerves, to try not
to get excited.</TE>
<TE>   "The adrenaline is so strong," he said. "It feels like it's the
only place I'd ever want to be. You feel ecstatic and you feel sick
at the same time ... a lot of amazing things go through your head and
body that day."</TE>
<TE>   When he looks back at his other Masters, Duval says two of them
stand out as occasions when he should have won, in 1998 and last
year.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I missed some putts on 16, 17, 18, but I made every one of
them from one to 15, so I got a lot out of my round on that day."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, that hasn't really been the case for Duval. His
best finish in a stroke-play event this year is a tie for 22nd at Bay
Hill. In a three-tournament span, Duval withdrew from the Nissan Open
because of flu, lost in the first round of the match play event at La
Costa and missed the cut at Doral.</TE>
<TE>   He tied for 28th at the Players Championship and tied for 34th in
his last tournament, two weeks ago at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   None of that matters if Duval plays up to his capabilities, a
scenario he sees as likely.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I've proven I can win here," he said. "No, I don't
have a coat sitting upstairs in the locker, but under the
circumstances of having a chance starting the final day, I've put up
the scores."</TE>
<TE>   At least he has proven he can win a major. Last year at Royal
Lytham, Duval won the British Open when he was 10 under the last two
rounds. But despite his 65 on Saturday, he was still tied for the
54-hole lead with Bernhard Langer, Alexander Cejka and Ian Woosnam.
Duval's 67 on Sunday was within one shot of the low round of the day
and when none of his co-leaders managed to break par, Duval won by
three shots.</TE>
<TE>   Duval says his bad back is a memory and he is as healthy as he has
been in years.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing on me hurts," he said. "I'm expecting great things, but
at the same time, I'm not forcing it. I'm just trying to work my way
back up there and take my time."</TE>
<TE>   The clock starts running Thursday.</TE>

<HD>He Prefers Being Graded on Curves</HD>
<DH>Motorsports: Da Matta, gunning for his fourth consecutive
victory, likes the Long Beach course.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cristiano da Matta has won the last three CART races--the last two in
2001, including Fontana, and the season opener in Monterrey,
Mexico--but don't ask him if he has been dominating.</LD>
<LD>   "I've just won a few races," the jockey-sized Brazilian said after
arriving in Long Beach for Sunday's 28th annual Toyota Grand Prix.
"Dominating is the way Alex Zanardi or Juan Montoya won their
championships. If I win a few more, maybe you can say that about me,
but not yet."</LD>
<LD>   Zanardi won five races in 1997 and six in 1998. Montoya won seven
in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   Da Matta, who drives a Chevron-sponsored No. 6 Toyota-Lola, has
proved to be one of CART's most versatile drivers, having won on four
different disciplines--oval, road course, street circuit and
superspeedway--but he says he is happiest in road and street races,
such as Long Beach, a busy 1.97-mile course with 11 turns.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Long Beach. It and Surfers Paradise in Australia are the
most challenging, the most interesting we run. Some street courses,
you just go, you don't even have to think, you just put the maximum
level of downforce in the car, but not Long Beach. Braking is quite
difficult. It has those two long straight stretches and some
difficult turns, so we must struggle to find a compromise."</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta finished second last year, splitting Penske teammates
Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran. Castroneves led all 82 laps, but
Da Matta was right on his bumper most of the day.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't running well when we arrived here, but we came up with
a solution to our problem and had an all-out run. Helio did a good
job. He gave me the outside, but I just couldn't get by. It was a
very good race."</TE>
<TE>   And what was the solution?</TE>
<TE>   "If we had finished 15th, I would tell you,'' he said with a sly
smile. "But we finished second, so I can't tell."</TE>
<TE>   Two things he will talk about are the rule changes made since
Chris Pook took over as CART president. One eliminates fuel economy
races and the other makes qualifying more equal and profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Every driver, every team, even the engineers, used to complain
about having to conserve fuel during a race. It was like they would
say, 'We're spending all this money, all these engineers working
here, to make all this power, then it comes race time, sometimes we
have to lean the engine to get better fuel economy for race
strategy.'</TE>
<TE>   "So the fact that we are going to be able to run as fast as you
can, using as much fuel as you want, that's going to be a great
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Pre-Pook qualifying consisted of two 30-minute sessions, with the
field split in half, on Saturday. This year there is one 45-minute
session with all cars running--but each allowed only 15 laps at
speed--on Friday and another Saturday. Low qualifier for each session
receives one series point.</TE>
<TE>   "This is much fairer," da Matta said. "Before, the two sessions
were never equal. Track conditions would often change between
sessions. This way, everyone will have the same chance."</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta is often asked if the absence of the Penske drivers, who
won five races and the championship between them last year, will make
it easier to win his first CART championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it will make much difference, the competition will
still be tough," he said. "Of course, you always like to defeat a
champion and this year there will be none to beat. That is the
downside. On the other hand, I think Gil and Helio lost a lot more by
switching to the IRL than we did by losing them.</TE>
<TE>   "The [class of] drivers in the IRL is not even close, and I am
sure before the year is out that both Gil and Helio will miss road
racing. That's how they grew up racing in Brazil. Now they're only on
ovals. I would think it would get awfully old."</TE>
<TE>   Da Matta's highest points finish was fifth last year, but
championships are not new to him. He won Indy Lights in 1998,
including a win at Long Beach, and before coming to the U.S., won six
Brazilian titles in Formula 3, Formula Ford and karts.</TE>
<TE>   If he wins Sunday, da Matta will equal the CART record for
consecutive wins at four. Al Unser Jr. did it in 1990 and Zanardi in
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Although Da Matta has won three times on ovals (Chicago 2000 and
Mexico 2001, 2002), and on a superspeedway (California Speedway,
2001), he says it is much more demanding for a driver to win on a
street or road circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "On a superspeedway, the car is 95% and the driver only 5%, on
short ovals, the car is 85% and the driver 15%, but on street and
road courses it's 50-50," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never boring running on a big oval, not when you're going
250 mph, but you don't get the same challenges you get on a road or
street course where you have to have more understanding of what your
car is doing."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In less than one year, the New Jersey Nets have gone from one of the
NBA's perennial doormats to a division champion.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets won their first division title since joining the NBA in
1976 by riding another strong performance by Jason Kidd to a 101-88
victory over the Washington Wizards on Tuesday night at East
Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Kidd had 21 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds.</LD>
<TE>   "This is very exciting," said General Manager Rod Thorn, who has
transformed a team that won 26 games a year ago into one of the best
in the league. "It's a lot better feeling than at this time last year
when we were not competitive. Going into every game, knowing we have
a chance to win, is a big step for us."</TE>
<TE>   And the Atlantic Division title isn't all the Nets can capture.
The Nets' 50th victory--the most they have won in an NBA season--also
cut their magic number for clinching the best record in the Eastern
Conference to three.</TE>
<TE>   Any combination of either three Net wins in their final four games
or Detroit losses in its last five would clinch the conference's No.
1 seed in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Only one year ago, New Jersey posted a 26-56 record in Byron
Scott's rookie season as coach, continuing a trend in which the
two-time former ABA champions finished near to the bottom of the
league.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 108, Portland 96--Michael Finley scored 27 points and Nick
Van Exel added 21 at Dallas as the Mavericks, playing without Dirk
Nowitzki, avenged one of their most embarrassing losses of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers went down fighting, though. Scottie Pippen was
ejected with 2:11 left for throwing a punch at Van Exel, Rasheed
Wallace was tossed with 58 seconds left in the third quarter for his
second technical foul--both for arguing with officials--and Bonzi
Wells got a flagrant foul in the first quarter that helped Dallas go
ahead for good.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks stretched their lead in the Midwest Division to a
game over the San Antonio Spurs despite Nowitzki, their top scorer
and rebounder, watching because of a sprained left ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers lost for the fifth time in seven games and did
not resemble the team that beat Dallas, 132-106, on March 14.</TE>
<TE>   Portland trailed, 79-76, after a layup by Ruben Patterson when
Wallace said something to an official and picked up his second
technical, an automatic ejection.</TE>
<TE>   Bonzi Wells led Portland with 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento 122, Minnesota 103--Chris Webber scored 30 points and
Peja Stojakovic added 23 at Sacramento as the Kings won their ninth
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento's magic number for clinching home-court advantage
throughout the playoffs was reduced to two.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett had 15 points for Minnesota, which remained two
games ahead of Portland for the fifth playoff spot in the Western
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 108, New York 97--Patrick Ewing got a rare start, made the
game's first basket and went out a winner in what might have been his
final game at Madison Square Garden as the Magic clinched a playoff
berth.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando moved two games ahead of the Charlotte Hornets in the race
for fourth in the East and home-court advantage in the first round of
the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Hudson led the Magic with 29 points. Allan Houston scored 26
for the Knicks.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 84, Charlotte 80--Antonio Davis scored 24 points at
Toronto as the Raptors extended their franchise-record winning streak
to nine games.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors opened a two-game lead over the idle Indiana Pacers
for the final Eastern Conference playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal Mashburn scored 21 points for Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 92, Milwaukee 90--Dikembe Mutombo scored 10 of his 22
points in a three-minute stretch late in the fourth quarter to lead
the 76ers past the Bucks at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee's Tim Thomas missed a game-tying jumper at the buzzer.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Cassell scored 19 for the Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 99, Seattle 92--Stephon Marbury had 27 points, including a
three-point play in the final minute, as the Suns ended a four-game
losing streak with a victory at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Miami 120, Houston 117--Eddie Jones scored 26 points to help the
Heat keep its slim playoff hopes alive with a double-overtime victory
at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The only way Miami can salvage the playoffs is to win its
remaining games and for Milwaukee to lose the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley scored 35 and 30 points,
respectively, for Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 97, Denver 86--Stromile Swift scored 20 points as the
Grizzlies won despite not scoring a field goal in the final seven
minutes at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota center Marc Jackson was suspended without pay for one
game by the NBA for his flagrant foul against Golden State's Bob Sura
on Monday.</TE>

<HD>Eligibility Rule Moves Ahead</HD>
<DH>NCAA: Proposal allows high school players who declare for
NBA draft to still play in college.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NCAA moved Tuesday toward allowing high school basketball players
to declare for the NBA draft and even be drafted without losing their
college eligibility but stopped short of the sweeping changes in
amateurism rules that had been proposed.</LD>
<LD>   Players still would lose their eligibility if they hired an agent
or signed with a team under a proposal that was forwarded by the
management council to the NCAA board of directors for a vote April 25
in Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   If approved, the rule would go into effect before the 2003 draft,
leaving NBA teams and college coaches to play a guessing game about
what prospects will do--and giving prospects a chance to see if--and
where--they are drafted before making a decision.</LD>
<TE>   It would be a headache for college and pro teams. But such a rule
would allow those who make ill-advised decisions to declare for the
draft--such as undrafted players Taj McDavid from South Carolina in
1996 or Ellis Richardson from Sun Valley Poly High in 1998--to play
in college without appealing to the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   It also would have allowed Tyson Chandler to reconsider after his
rights were traded from the Clippers to the Chicago Bulls on draft
day, though questions remain about how long a team would retain a
player's rights.</TE>
<TE>   One NBA general manager compared the situation to drafting a
European player who might not arrive for an indefinite period, but
another NBA official has said although more players would probably
declare, it could make teams less likely to choose young players.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, there were fewer changes approved than some predicted.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal that would have allowed men's and women's basketball
players already in college to be drafted and then choose to return to
college competition was rejected, along with a number of other
proposals related to amateurism supported by outgoing NCAA President
Cedric Dempsey.</TE>
<TE>   The current rule allows basketball players to return after
declaring for the draft only if they withdraw at least a week before
the draft or go undrafted--though they must not hire an agent.</TE>
<TE>   However, the council gave a thumbs-up to a new proposal that would
give football players the right to change their minds after declaring
for the NFL draft--but only for 72 hours.</TE>
<TE>   That measure comes on the heels of Tennessee receiver Donte
Stallworth losing his eligibility after declaring for the draft
despite trying to withdraw only several hours later. Although the NFL
agreed, the NCAA would not allow him to resume his college career.</TE>
<TE>   The football issue will not receive a final vote before this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more radical proposals that were rejected were those
that would have allowed prospects to sign professional contracts,
compete with professionals and receive compensation beyond expenses
before competing in college.</TE>
<TE>   In other issues addressed, the NCAA management council backed a
series of proposals that would increase academic standards regarding
initial eligibility and progress toward a degree.</TE>
<TE>   Those measures will be returned to the NCAA membership for further
review before final consideration in October.</TE>
<TE>   "This action means the council endorses the concept of changing
our initial-eligibility and progress-toward-degree standards," said
Percy Bates, faculty athletics representative from the University of
Michigan and chair of the NCAA management council.</TE>
<TE>   In other action, the group emphasized that summer workouts for
football prospects should be overseen by someone with authority to
cancel or change the workout for safety reasons--a reaction to last
year's rash of football-related deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The group also supported a proposal that would eliminate limits on
how much a student-athlete can earn by working while enrolled, and it
forwarded recommendations lifting the moratorium on the number of
postseason bowl games and allowing teams with 6-6 records to be
eligible for bowl games.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jay John, an assistant at Arizona, will be hired as coach of the
Oregon State men's basketball team, school officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   John, 43, has been an assistant to Lute Olson for four seasons.
Before that, he spent a season as an assistant at Oregon and eight
seasons as an assistant at Butler.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the situation at Oregon State is a great opportunity for
Jay," Olson said.</LD>
<TE>   "He knows a lot of the players in the program. We had been
involved in trying to recruit Philip Ricci, Brian Jackson and Jimmie
Haywood."</TE>
<TE>   John was the lead recruiter of Arizona guard Jason Gardner and
forward Channing Frye.</TE>
<TE>   "Jay is very good with people," said Ernie Kent, Oregon's coach.
"He is the type of guy that will work with passion."</TE>
<TE>   John replaces Ritchie McKay, who was 22-37 in two seasons. McKay
resigned last month to replace Fran Fraschilla at New Mexico.</TE>

<TE>   Unrestricted free agent Joe Jurevicius left the New York Giants

<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   Former NFL receiver Jeff Graham filed a $10-million lawsuit at
Dayton, Ohio, contending he was the victim of racial profiling by a
sheriff's deputy.</TE>
<TE>   Graham was arrested Jan. 19 after a gun was found in his truck. No
criminal charges were filed and he was released after being held
about six hours.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit filed Monday names as defendants Sheriff Dave Vore,
Deputy David Cole, Sgt. Daryl Wilson and five unidentified deputies
or investigators.</TE>
<TE>   The suit says Cole went onto Graham's property without a warrant,
banged on the window of his truck while he was talking on a cell
phone, placed Graham under arrest and searched the truck without
consent.</TE>
<TE>   Cole found a legal gun registered to Graham's father, Walter
Graham Jr., the suit said. The elder Graham had died a month earlier
when his car struck a tree near the family's home, where Jeff Graham
was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson was named as a defendant because he released information
that Jeff Graham had been charged with carrying a concealed weapon,
the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Graham played for San Diego last season but was released in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Former Minnesota men's basketball coach Clem Haskins and the
university have agreed to take their dispute over a $1.5-million
buyout to arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   The university bought out Haskins' contract in 1999 amid a
cheating scandal in which coursework was done for some players by a
former office manager in the academic counseling unit.</TE>
<TE>   Five months after the buyout, a university investigation concluded
that Haskins was involved in the fraud. The university sued to
recover at least $1 million, plus punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Former Olympic gymnast Olga Korbut, 46, was allowed to enter a
pretrial diversion program rather than be prosecuted on misdemeanor
shoplifting charges, according to court documents filed at
Lawrenceville, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   Korbut was arrested Jan. 31 and charged with stealing $19 worth of
goods at a supermarket.</TE>

<HD>Ohlund's Goal Keeps Canucks in the Hunt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattias Ohlund scored the game-winner late in the second period and
Dan Cloutier stopped 30 shots, and the Vancouver Canucks extended
their unbeaten streak to seven games with a 2-1 victory over the
Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives you confidence when your goaltender plays as well Dan
did," Vancouver Coach Marc Crawford said. "You can build on some
momentum defensively. We are going to get our chances with the type
of scoring people that we've got."</LD>
<LD>   Vancouver, 6-0-1 in its last seven games, occupies the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Western Conference. A Vancouver loss in
regulation Tuesday would have clinched a playoff spot for the Kings.
The Canucks can clinch a playoff spot with victories over the Kings
on Thursday and Calgary on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver is 11-2-1 in its last 14 games and reached 90 points for
the third time in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado had a chance to move three points ahead of San Jose in
the race for the second seeding in the West, but struggled after a
strong first period.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very disappointing and we had a lack of intensity,"
Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said. "If we put out an effort, we would
have a chance at winning the hockey game. This time of the season, we
are telling the world that we want to finish second overall, but
that's not the way that we are working."</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche peppered Cloutier with seven shots on its first two
power plays before Rob Blake scored with 6:23 left in the first
period.</TE>
<TE>   But after the early flurry, Colorado went flat.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 2, Boston 2--Vincent Lecavalier scored twice, the second
time with 27 seconds left in regulation, giving the Lightning a tie
at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins, who are one point shy of reaching 100 points for the
first time since 1993, moved four points ahead of Philadelphia for
the Eastern Conference lead.</TE>
<TE>   They need any combination of three points to clinch home ice
throughout the conference playoffs. Boston has two games left, the
Flyers have three.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 3, Nashville 2--Ray Ferraro scored his second goal of
the game on a power play with 4:52 left to lift the Blues at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Stillman got Al MacInnis' rebound behind the net and passed
to Ferraro at the right of the crease. Ferraro wristed the puck past
rookie Jan Lasak for the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Lasak was recalled Monday from American Hockey League affiliate
Milwaukee and made his NHL debut. He had to face a penalty shot by
Keith Tkachuk, which he stopped.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, Chicago 1--Steve Konowalchuk scored his first goal
in 12 months, and the host Capitals kept their faint playoff hopes
alive.</TE>
<TE>   The Capitals pulled within four points of first-place Carolina in
the Southeast Division. But the Hurricanes need only one point in
their last three games to clinch the title.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 4, Calgary 2--Brian Savage scored the go-ahead goal at
9:51 of the third period at Calgary, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix kept pace with St. Louis and Vancouver in the Western
Conference playoff race. The Coyotes are in seventh place, one point
behind St. Louis and one ahead of Vancouver.</TE>

<LD>Ryan Klesko had a three-run homer for his first hit this season and
the San Diego Padres defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks, 5-2, Tuesday
night at San Diego, spoiling Todd Stottlemyre's first start in nearly
19 months.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Nevin hit a two-run homer in the first inning against
Stottlemyre, who was pitching for the first time since Sept. 21,
2000. He sat out last season because of a nerve problem in his right
shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   The defending World Series champion Diamondbacks are 0-4 in games
started by anyone other than Randy Johnson or Curt Schilling.</LD>
<TE>   Klesko, who hit 30 homers last year, had been 0 for 12 this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jones (1-0) won his first start this season and Trevor
Hoffman got three outs for his second save.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Milwaukee 5--Eli Marrero extended his sizzling start
with three hits, raising his batting average to .733, and scored the
go-ahead run at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Marrero, who began the season as a .229 hitter and the No. 3
catcher, has been playing the outfield and is 11 for 15 with a home
run and five runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   He hit a two-run double in the second, singled and scored in the
fourth and singled and scored on Fernando Vina's sacrifice fly
against Jose Cabrera (0-1) in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 10, Houston 5--Gary Bennett hit a three-run homer, John
Thomson won his second consecutive start and the host Rockies ended a
four-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Zeile and Jose Ortiz each had two-run homers for the Rockies.
Todd Helton came out of a slump with three hits and two runs batted
in.</TE>
<TE>   Thomson (2-0) went six innings, giving up five runs and eight hits
with no walks and seven strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 2, New York 0--Jon Lieber gave up two hits in eight
innings at Chicago and the Cubs scored more than one run for the
first time in four games.</TE>

<HD>Rolen Gives Phillie Fans Good Vibes</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>This time, Scott Rolen got plenty of cheers.</LD>
<LD>   Rolen homered and drove in the go-ahead run with a double in the
seventh inning Tuesday night, leading the Philadelphia Phillies to a
7-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</LD>
<LD>   Mike Lieberthal had two hits and two runs batted in, and the
Phillies' offense finally got rolling with a season high in runs and
hits (11).</LD>
<TE>   "I left some runners on base last night and that could've carried
over," Rolen said. "I got some pitches to hit and I hit them."</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, booed loudly after he popped out to second base with one
out and a runner on third in the ninth inning of Philadelphia's 2-1
loss to the Braves on Monday, broke a 4-4 tie with a run-scoring
double against reliever Tim Spooneybarger.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen's two-run homer off Jason Marquis (1-1) gave the Phillies a
2-0 lead in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta took a 4-3 lead in the seventh inning when Javy Lopez hit
a three-run homer off Philadelphia starter Terry Adams.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michelle Kwan had a different reason to cry this time.</LD>
<LD>   Kwan, the most accomplished figure skater of her generation,
Tuesday night won the 2001 Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur
athlete.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm already a little teary-eyed," Kwan said. "I always wanted to
be a legend.... It feels like a dream come true."</LD>
<TE>   Kwan won four world championships and six U.S. titles, but
finished second behind Tara Lipinski in the 1998 Winter Olympics and
third behind Sarah Hughes in the 2002 Games.</TE>
<TE>   The other finalists for the Sullivan were distance runner Alan
Webb, swimmer Natalie Coughlin, Chicago Cub pitching prospect and
former USC star Mark Prior and gymnast</TE>

<LD>Laker basketball, in its full form, was back on the air Tuesday
night, and the action really picked up during a timeout midway though
the second quarter, when Shaq and Kobe got out of the way to make
room for the two biggest names in Los Angeles sports history.</LD>
<LD>   Vin Scully, welcoming Chick Hearn back to the broadcast table.</LD>
<LD>   "For the Los Angeles Lakers, the basketball fans of Los Angeles
and sports fans everywhere, we take time out to salute the return of
Chick Hearn," Scully said via videotape.</LD>
<TE>   "Chick, an inspiration to each and every one of us, has had his
troubles and, as usual, has bounced back.</TE>
<TE>   "So he returns for this game, and from all of us, congratulations,
God bless and welcome back, Chick."</TE>
<TE>   Camera cut to Hearn, behind the Laker microphone for the first
time since December, watching the video and blushing.</TE>
<TE>   "Boy, that was nice," said Hearn, thoroughly surprised and
pleased. "That was nice. You guys ... "</TE>
<TE>   Hearn paused to clear the lump from his throat.</TE>
<TE>   " ... I don't know how you can treat me so well.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm grateful that you do."</TE>
<TE>   Lump-in-throat was a contagious condition Tuesday, with Laker fans
reacquainting themselves with an old friend who had been sidelined
for 56 games, having been slowed by a double-team that would have
floored men half his age--open-heart surgery followed by
hip-replacement surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Since Christmas, we had followed the medical updates, read the
progress reports, heard the rumors that he might make it back before
the playoffs. We held out hope, but let's face it: It was nervous
time. Hearn's 85. He had just been introduced to a new heart valve,
an artificial hip. A comeback, after 31/2 months, was going to have
to be seen to be believed.</TE>
<TE>   So we saw Hearn back, headset back in place, looking good if a
little gaunt, sounding enthused if a little frail.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to take care of you, big fella," Stu Lantz assured his
longtime partner. "You deserve everything and more. I just can't
figure out why they're playing this game."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time all night, Hearn sounded confused.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you mean that?" he asked, unknowingly setting Lantz up for
a punch line.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were here to celebrate your return," Lantz said. "We
don't want to watch a basketball game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers and the Utah Jazz were the sideshow, as everyone seemed
to agree except the referees. Before the game, the Lakers' radio
station, KLAC 570, passed out hand-held Chick Hearn masks to every
fan. Fox Sports Net aired taped tributes from Bob Miller, Tom
Lasorda, Penny Marshall, Seal and other Staples Center dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the moment everyone was waiting for: Hearn's announced
return--a few seconds for Chick to stand and wave and acknowledge the
cheers from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was on board except the game officials, who were supposed
to hold the ball until Hearn received his ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, however, the cameras jerked away from Hearn and focused
on the court, because the game had just tipped off and the Lakers
were taking a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a game tonight?" Lantz deadpanned, aiming a subtle jab at
the officials' rather poor sense of timing.</TE>
<TE>   Gamely, Hearn joined right in.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the happiest I've been since I married Marge!" he
exclaimed, picking right up where he left off, settling in quickly
for another "Shaq down the middle ... BLOWS THE LAYUP!!!"</TE>
<TE>   Hearn was back, even if his vocal cords trailed him by about a
quarter-and-a-half. Initially, his voice sounded a little weak and
scratchy, as his wife Marge had predicted during a pregame television
interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Some days his voice is still a little weak," Marge said. "That's
from the vocal cords being stretched with tubes and what have you.
But it'll get stronger as he talks and uses it."</TE>
<TE>   Another accurate prediction. By the end of the third quarter,
Hearn, buoyed by the Lakers' inspired play, sounded more robust,
edging closer to old form. Finally, watching Kobe Bryant beat three
defenders for a spectacular basket, Hearn let loose.</TE>
<TE>   "OHHHH!!!" he roared as the ball swished through the hoop. "He
made a basket with three men on him! That's one of the great plays of
the season!"</TE>
<TE>   Or at least until Bryant's next spectacular basket--a running
buzzer-beater that put the Lakers ahead, 87-70, at the end of the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad I came back to see that!"</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Marge had sounded quite the concerned wife,
saying she hoped "he can keep up with everything. I think he can."</TE>
<TE>   Hearn managed a good deal better than the Jazz, on their way to a
112-82 defeat and officially out of it with 8:37 left--according to
popular decree, back after so long an absence.</TE>
<TE>   "This game is in the refrigerator!" Hearn announced as the Lakers
opened a 96-70 lead, sounding thrilled with every syllable.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't said that in SO long!"</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry made it 98-70.</TE>
<TE>   "The Jello's jigglin'!"</TE>
<TE>   All in all, it was a pretty good episode of the 2001-2002
highlight film. Once again, the Lakers were acting the part of
championship contenders. But better than that, after 31/2 months, the
Lakers had their soundtrack back.</TE>

<LD>How good was Westchester this season? One local coach said the Comets
could have beaten some college teams. Westchester's run to the state
championship culminated in a game against Oakland Tech at
Sacramento's Arco Arena on March 23. The players waited to take the
court before the game, right, but the high-flying Comets put on a
show during warmups, above, and went on to complete their 32-2 season
with an 80-75 victory. Hassan Adams, bottom left, and Brandon Heath
were of particular interest to ESPN cameras before the game for a
show titled "Sidelines: LA Hoops," and Arizona Coach Lute Olson,
below, no stranger when it comes to recruiting local players, showed
up for a game against Fairfax in January to watch Adams, who will be
a Wildcat next season.</LD>

<LD>These warm and fuzzy people live among you:</LD>
<LD>   Eric Oliver: "I was stunned to see you made one small reference to
the fact Bill Shoemaker had been drinking prior to his accident. He
was drunk! Then he blamed everyone else for his condition. I was
amazed you pulled your punches in writing such a sympathetic
article."</LD>
<LD>   I thought about tipping over his wheelchair ...</LD>
<TE>   Pat: "It angers me to read Shoemaker's quote: 'This wasn't
anyone's fault but my own.' Where was this sentiment 11 years ago
when he was suing Ford and Caltrans for responsibility of his crash?
I'm surprised Willie didn't name Jack Daniel's in his lawsuit. The
whole thing makes me really mad. B.S. is no hero of mine."</TE>
<TE>   Why do I have the feeling this isn't your first case of road rage?</TE>
<TE>   Jim Fikar: "Shoemaker was legally drunk and ultimately caused his
own situation. Did he accept responsibility and own up to the poor
choices he made that day? Hell, no, he sued Ford. What a loser!</TE>
<TE>   Shoemaker can't lift a finger, and you wouldn't lift a finger for
him, and you thought you had nothing in common.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Wakeham: "What a great article. Shoemaker is a true hero. Oh,
wait, he got drunk and crashed. Thank God he didn't put someone else
in a wheelchair. Your article praising an idiot drunk midget is your
worst yet, and that's hard to do after most of your work."</TE>
<TE>   Where would I be without my faithful readers?</TE>
<TE>   Dave: "Your column on Shoemaker was very touching and uplifting.
The only problem is it might cut down on your hate mail."</TE>
<TE>   I see what you mean, Dave.</TE>
<TE>   James Stevens: "The Dodgers must have really upset you when they
won. You had to have Plaschke ghost write a column for you."</TE>
<TE>   How do you know it wasn't Pucin?</TE>
<TE>   My Name Is Remy: "u sure sugar coated that shoemaker story. im
sure u kno he was drinking, then drove home.sued &amp; even got money for
his daughter.shame."</TE>
<TE>   Hope you call a taxi or have a designated driver to get you home.</TE>
<TE>   Morris: "I don't necessarily consider you an idiot, but then I
don't know you."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we can get together at a Spark game and become better
acquainted--just wait for me by the front door.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer L.: "You got some nerve. What makes you think you're
better than the women who play golf on the LPGA Tour?"</TE>
<TE>   I got to first base with Salma Hayek.</TE>
<TE>   Rick: "I don't think Chick Hearn [should have] come back, and for
some reason I know you're probably thinking the same thing, and
you're the only person with the guts to write it. I wrote a
commentary for my college paper--here's the address if you're
interested."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not.</TE>
<TE>   Steven M. McGuire: "I notice you didn't win a Pulitzer Prize.
Maybe it's because whining and crying don't qualify for awards."</TE>
<TE>   That's the problem with running an e-mail as "The Last Word" every
day.</TE>
<TE>   Bill McGarry: "Is it really necessary to print the Dodger season
is over before it has begun. You're not a fan, but a fair-weather,
pompous jerk who has probably never competed for anything other than
the last spot on the bus--pushing an old lady out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   I asked her nicely. She wouldn't budge, so I just nudged her a
little.</TE>
<TE>   E. Binn: "I'm 62 and have never responded in my entire life to a
published article, however your article about the LPGA really
[ticked] me off. It seems hardly fair for you to require women to
show more skin ... Anyway, you're the reporter and I'm the critic of
your reporting. You can bust my butt if you want."</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, at least I won't make you bare it.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Weltman: "I was going to ignore your vicious column mocking
the LPGA, but alas, I can not ... "</TE>
<TE>   That's funny, I had no problem ignoring the rest of your e-mail.</TE>
<TE>   LA4HOTPROP: "Dear Archie Bunker, I'm amazed The Times still
employs you after reading your column on the LPGA. You appear to be
at the top of the list in the following categories: womanizer,
homophobe and tasteless writing."</TE>
<TE>   The paper will never get rid of someone who leads in so many
categories.</TE>
<TE>   Jim M.: "I've noticed when the Dodgers lose you are very quick to
tear into them. Shouldn't the Dodgers get their due for winning?"</TE>
<TE>   After they thank me for getting Kazuhisa Ishii to pitch with his
eyes open.</TE>
<TE>   Edge of the West: "Please expose the lame Dodger broadcast team.
Vin Scully is a legend, but the other guys [are terrible] ... I can
no longer listen to a Dodger game."</TE>
<TE>   And that's a bad thing?</TE>
<TE>   Greg Spencer: "It seems to me you are not even a fan. I don't
think Dodger haters should be writing about the Dodgers. I'd never
talk to you if I was a player on the Dodgers. I'd spit on your
shoes."</TE>
<TE>   If you were on the Dodgers and you tried to spit on my shoes,
you'd miss.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Sports Editor Bill
Dwyre:</TE>
<TE>   "I read the column on Shoemaker and I need to point out a mistake.
Since it was well-written, sensitive almost to the point of being
poignant, and actually dealt with something in the world of sports
that mattered, it occurred to me there is no way in the world it
could have been written by you."</TE>
<TE>   There's just no end to the crank e-mail.</TE>

<HD>USTA Finds a Home in Carson Complex</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Revamped program's move from south Florida could
also lead to new tournament.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Tennis Assn. is expected to move the headquarters for its
revamped player development program to Southern California, striking
a deal with Anschutz Entertainment Group.</LD>
<LD>   "We're close to a deal," Arlen Kantarian, the USTA's chief
executive in charge of professional tennis, said in Houston during
the Davis Cup quarterfinal against Spain.</LD>
<LD>   Details are being finalized, but the location would be in Carson.
Construction has started on a $120-million sports complex at Cal
State Dominguez Hills, which will include soccer and tennis stadiums.
The soccer stadium will take 15 months to complete and is scheduled
to open in June 2003, according to AEG President Tim Leiweke.</LD>
<TE>   A month later, the 13,000-seat tennis stadium is scheduled to
open. The tennis complex is the home of the Pete Sampras Tennis
Academy, and Kantarian said the USTA is working on combining forces
with the academy.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the USTA's player development center and staff are in Key
Biscayne, Fla., home of the professional men's and women's
tournament. Officials envision maintaining a presence in south
Florida as well as Flushing Meadow, N.Y., home of the U.S. Open. A
finalized agreement could be announced as early as this week or as
late as this month.</TE>
<TE>   The deal has been long in the making. Paul Annacone, once the
longtime coach of Sampras, was hired as managing director of USA
Tennis High Performance, months after the USTA realized it needed to
explore a change in its development program. Kantarian and Annacone
were in Southern California in February, meeting with AEG officials
and looking at other sites.</TE>
<TE>   This is viewed as a smaller piece of the puzzle in a larger
proposed deal between the USTA and AEG. Ideally, Kantarian would like
to see either a combined event or back-to-back men's and women's
tournaments in Carson, which would kick off a summer season of tennis
leading up to the U.S. Open.</TE>

<HD>A Renaissance for Fullerton Softball</HD>

<LD>Cal State Fullerton's softball team has not appeared in the Women's
College World Series since 1995 and its only national championship
came in 1986. That doesn't sit well with noted alumna Michelle
Gromacki.</LD>
<LD>   "It does seem like it's too long," said the third-year coach who
was a catcher on the 1986 team.</LD>
<LD>   Gromacki has the Titans on a path to return to Oklahoma City for
the World Series. Fullerton has ridden a 29-game winning streak--the
nation's longest this season--to a No. 7 national ranking. The Titans
(33-9) can add to it Thursday with a nonconference doubleheader at
Loyola Marymount after sweeping a three-game Big West Conference
series against Long Beach State last weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Junior catcher Jenny Topping, who played in the World Series for
Washington as a freshman, is Fullerton's most visible player. Topping
was the Big West player of the year as a sophomore and has been just
as impressive this season. Despite missing the first 11 games of the
season because of a separated right shoulder, the left-handed catcher
is batting .479 with eight homers and 26 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "She's had an impact offensively, defensively, wherever, you name
it," Gromacki said. "She's allowed us to take the program to another
level."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Titans' success revolves around three pitchers: Gina
Oaks, Jodie Cox and Christy Robitaille. Oaks is 16-2 with a 0.70
earned-run average; Cox is 13-4 with a 1.60 ERA, and Robitaille is
9-3 with a 1.56 ERA. The three have combined for 347 strikeouts in
310 innings. Oaks, a junior, was invited to upcoming tryouts for the
U.S. national team at its Chula Vista camp.</TE>
<TE>   Gromacki said her pitchers are versatile.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that's great about them is that they care more about
each other than themselves," she said. "It doesn't matter who starts
a game. One may start a game and another may finish."</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton started its streak after splitting a Feb. 27
doubleheader with UCLA. The Titans dropped the second game that day
but in the opener defeated the top-ranked Bruins, 3-1, behind Oaks'
four-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "Beating them helped us believe we can do it," Gromacki said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Braswell isn't heading to Oregon State and it is good news
for the Cal State Northridge men's basketball program. Braswell
interviewed for the job in the higher-profile Pacific 10--he was a
finalist for the same job two years ago--but reportedly pulled out of
consideration on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Oregon State hired Arizona assistant Jay John after
looking at Braswell, South Florida Coach Seth Greenberg and Pacific
Coach Bob Thomason. Braswell is 97-79 with one NCAA tournament
appearance in six seasons at Northridge. The Matadors were rebuilding
in their first season in the Big West Conference and finished 12-16.
However, they lose only two seniors--all-conference point guard
Markus Carr and center Jermar Welch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Stacey Nuveman helped UCLA end two impressive streaks.
Nuveman hit two home runs Sunday to help the top-ranked Bruins defeat
second-ranked Arizona, 6-5, before a record crowd of 3,161 at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the first by a visiting team against the Wildcats
(35-5, 4-1 in Pacific 10) in 70 games. Arizona hadn't lost at home
since April 9, 2000. The Bruins (34-6, 2-3) also dealt pitcher Jennie
Finch her first loss in 60 games. Finch went an NCAA-record 32-0 last
season and had won 20 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Dantzscher led UCLA into the NCAA women's gymnastics
championships with a dominant performance Saturday at the South
Central Regional in Tempe, Ariz. Dantzscher placed first in the
uneven bars (9.95), floor exercise (9.95) and vault (9.90). The
sophomore also won the all-around title.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA will begin its quest for a third consecutive NCAA title on
April 18 at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Fullerton junior Kelly Mathiasen qualified as an
individual by recording the third-highest all-around score at the
regional in Tempe.</TE>

<HD>Chief's Inflexibility Doomed Him</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't Mayor Jim Hahn who did in Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks, and it wasn't the Police Commission. If City Council
members make it a trifecta, it won't be them either.</LD>
<LD>   Bernie Parks has always been dedicated, and sometimes he's been an
inspiration, and he brought a much-deserved sense of relief to a
community that had lived in fear of unscrupulous thugs wearing
badges.</LD>
<LD>   But Parks was sunk by the very thing that drove him to the top of
a force he served through four decades--the myopic conviction that by
sheer will, he, and he alone, could fix what was wrong with the LAPD.</LD>
<TE>   If there was anything surprising about Tuesday's Police Commission
vote, it was only the margin. As deliberations dragged on behind
closed doors, people began wondering if Parks might find a third vote
of support among the five commissioners. But in the end it was 4 to
1, which makes it all the more clear it's time for Parks to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Violent crime has continued to rise ... while cities such as New
York and Chicago are experiencing a drop," said Rick Caruso, head of
the Police Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But crime rises and falls in every city, often without any direct
relationship to what police do or don't do. Parks' greater
liabilities were rock-bottom morale, which has led to an
1,100-officer shortage, and an inability to accept a glaring truth:</TE>
<TE>   As the Christopher Commission report put it 10 years ago, the
LAPD's problems are part of an inbred, entrenched, closed culture
that can only be saved by opening it up to outside review.</TE>
<TE>   Parks would have none of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Rampart scandal? Not a problem. The chief's got it under
control, and if you happen to hear anything to the contrary, it's
because the L.A. Times has "ginned up" a meager little story. A story
that begins, incidentally, back in 1994, when Parks himself headed
the Internal Affairs division that first heard complaints of rogue
cops brutalizing citizens and planting evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Christopher Commission said you've got to turn away from the
insular, retaliatory, bunker culture; the culture that sinks Serpicos
and anybody who blows a whistle," said Constance Rice, a civil rights
attorney who has represented victims of abuse, as well as officers
with grievances against the department.</TE>
<TE>   "When you don't share information with the D.A., you don't share
with the inspector general, and in fact get in the way of information
he needs; and you don't share information with the police
commissioners, that's the old culture," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say you can take care of your own problems with a
'policing ourselves' culture, you're going to have Rampart and you're
going to have Rodney King."</TE>
<TE>   Rice, who is African American, believes Mayor Hahn bungled the
Parks affair, publicly withdrawing his support without first building
an argument for it in the black community and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw a grenade into the process and badly politicized it, and
it's not salvageable at this point," she said of Hahn's relationship
with the black community, which helped put him where he is.</TE>
<TE>   But Rice agreed with the substance of Hahn's stand on Parks, and
had the courage to say so in a crowd of 1,500 at Second Baptist
Church.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the only one in the room who said Parks shouldn't get a
second term," said Rice.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, she said, will tell you that Internal Affairs is the engine
for reform, rather than outside review.</TE>
<TE>   "Internal Affairs is the problem. It's like putting Dracula in
charge of the blood bank."</TE>
<TE>   The black community had good reason to feel comfortable with Parks
in charge, Rice said, but it should have been more demanding.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to drive down Crenshaw, and there wasn't a time I didn't
see someone pulled over in what looked like a suspicious stop," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The attitude of the cops was, 'We own the streets.' When the
changes came, I expected the community to say, 'We like this guy. He
comes to our churches, he comes to dinner, cops are respecting us.
What more do you want?'</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm looking at it as a civil rights attorney who has studied
the system for 15 years, met with cops and lawyers and judges, and
wants to get to the point where it doesn't matter who the chief is."</TE>
<TE>   Parks has insisted that he's demanded the same professionalism
from every officer, and if morale is low as a result, so be it. But
some cops have told me they see it differently, and Rice does too.</TE>
<TE>   "He's fired some cops who should have been fired, but also kept
some who should have been fired. There are people everyone knows
committed the same offenses as someone who got fired, but because
they're in the chief's camp, they're not even investigated. Yes,
there is a group out to get him, and some of those are racist cops.
But the vast majority of officers are not in that camp. They're
concerned about how discipline is implemented, how fair it is and how
consistent."</TE>
<TE>   But for all of their intellectual differences, Rice has grown to
respect Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything he does is out of the profound belief that it's for
the good of the department, which he loves as much as he loves life.
What he does is not venal or a power trip or anything else. It's
totally to serve. He's blue. LAPD blue.</TE>
<TE>   "But I've been locked in a room with him in negotiations and seen
him interact with Jim Hahn, mediators and judges, and that rigidity
and inflexibility is ferocious to the point that it's the elephant in
the room.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he a great cop? No question. Is he dedicated? Off the scale.
But when it comes to leadership and the capacity to move people and
sell his vision, it didn't work, and a lot of it had to do with his
inability to hear anyone else."</TE>

<HD>A Savvy Referee for L.A.'s Secession Wars</HD>
<DH>Politics: Yaroslavsky plays a key role arbitrating between
activists, bureaucrats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If voters are asked to decide, perhaps this November, whether to
break Los Angeles into as many as four smaller cities, they won't see
Zev Yaroslavsky's name on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   But the powerful county supervisor, a fixture in Los Angeles
politics since the presidency of Gerald Ford, has left his
fingerprints all over the secession proposals for the San Fernando
Valley, Hollywood and the harbor area.</LD>
<LD>   As chairman of a little-known subcommittee of a state agency with
the power to take secession to the voters, Yaroslavsky became the
equivalent of the referee while city officials and secessionists
wrestled over precise terms of the breakup. Many of the stickiest
issues--how to divvy up such assets as police stations, for example,
or what utility rates Los Angeles might charge the breakaway
cities--landed squarely at his feet.</LD>
<TE>   He was sometimes gruff, accusing the city of trying to "torpedo"
the proposals or comparing turf-hungry Los Angeles bureaucrats to
lions gnawing on a slab of red meat. He was often in a hurry. And
time after time, Yaroslavsky came down on the side of what he called
common sense, using "gut checks" and "smell tests" to feel his way
through a swamp of competing interests and to look for compromises.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just calling them as I see them, trying to be fair and
logical and equitable," said Yaroslavsky, who has remained publicly
neutral on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Experience, Position Make for Ideal Arbiter</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the mustachioed politician, whom the late City
Council President John Ferraro called "master of the sound bite," is
a natural choice to arbitrate what could be one of the biggest
political upsets in Los Angeles history if the secession drives
succeed. As a county official, Yaroslavsky has a far smaller stake in
the outcome than do City Hall leaders. Yet, after almost 20 years as
a Los Angeles councilman, he knows city government better than most
anyone.</TE>
<TE>   He's especially savvy when it comes to the city budget--a source
of fierce tussling in the secession tug of war--because he spent 11
years running the council's influential Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as one of nine members of the Local Agency Formation
Commission, a state-created panel whose hottest decisions generally
involve sewer district annexations, Yaroslavsky will help decide
whether to put the breakaway proposals on the Nov. 5 ballot. It was a
position he sought, appointing himself to the LAFCO board five years
ago when he headed the Board of Supervisors. He said he wanted to be
part of the action when the secession campaigns revved up.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky took on an even more vigorous role last fall when
LAFCO Chairman Henri Pellissier asked him to lead a four-person
subcommittee to help craft secession packages that could go before
voters. It was a complex, fast-paced job that required Yaroslavsky to
spur city leaders and secessionists to agree on three proposals in a
matter of a few months.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been harsh on both sides," said Ron Deaton, the city's chief
legislative analyst and a lead negotiator for Los Angeles in the
secession debates. "I think what he's trying to do, whether it is
successful or not, is to give both sides enough pain to have them
feel obliged to negotiate between themselves to come to some
agreement, so that he doesn't have to make a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that," Deaton added with a wink as Yaroslavsky walked
by, "he's a miserable SOB."</TE>
<TE>   It's a playful jibe that elicits only a wry smile from
Yaroslavsky, who has made a career of taking on powerful forces
including the Los Angeles Police Department, commercial developers,
oil magnates and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Like the
secessionists, he was once the underdog too, a mop-haired Hebrew
teacher who shook up the political establishment by winning a seat on
the Los Angeles City Council at 26.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, some of Yaroslavsky's actions have helped smooth
the path for secessionists. In 1998, at his behest, the Board of
Supervisors doubled the length of time allotted to Valley secession
leaders to collect the 135,000 signatures needed to trigger a study
of cityhood's feasibility. Yaroslavsky, who represents the Westside
and much of the Valley, also pushed for public funding to verify the
signatures and conduct the studies rather than imposing hefty costs
on secession proponents.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Yaroslavsky's LAFCO panel aligned itself with
secession leaders on a number of key issues. The subcommittee
rejected the city's argument that it would be stuck with more than
$300 million a year in costs if the Valley secedes, instead
recommending that the Valley pay Los Angeles $36.6 million in annual
"alimony."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, that pleased secession advocates, who generally
give him high marks for fairness.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of his unique knowledge of city government, he's been
able to see through the voodoo economics of the city," said Richard
Close, a longtime leader of Sherman Oaks homeowners who heads the
secession group Valley VOTE. "He's able to see what's a real concern
and what is a fabricated concern."</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky's panel also said parks, fire stations, Van Nuys
Airport and other Valley assets should be transferred to the new city
at no cost. That recommendation defied advice from LAFCO's legal
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   But it was simply, Yaroslavsky said, a matter of common sense.</TE>
<TE>   "Valley taxpayers have paid plenty of taxes," he said. "If you're
going to say that a Valley police station doesn't belong to the
Valley because the Valley hasn't paid as much [tax] over the years as
the city has, then you have to deduct what the Valley taxpayers have
paid for city police stations.... And rather than go through that
accounting nightmare, let's just stipulate that if it's in the
Valley, it belongs to the Valley. If it's in the city, it belongs to
the city. Period, over and out."</TE>
<TE>   City negotiators eventually agreed to the asset split, provided
the Valley also share the liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO subcommittee hasn't always agreed with secessionists.
The panel decided against splitting up the city's Department of Water
and Power, saying it was working well. It also recommended that the
sewer system remain whole but said--in a victory for secession
backers--that the city should not be allowed to charge higher utility
rates for service in breakaway areas. Yaroslavsky's panel also turned
down Valley VOTE's request for a 10-year limit on the Valley's
alimony payment. It recommended a 20-year period during which
payments would gradually decrease.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the concessions to both sides, some Los Angeles leaders
voiced concern about the panel's fairness and attention to detail.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, a LAFCO board member who
opposes secession, said she was troubled that the subcommittee
"overruled" its own lawyer in recommending an asset split.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not taking into consideration rather basic concerns,"
she said. She noted, for example, the panel decided that if secession
succeeds, the breakaway cities should become independent on Jan. 1,
2003, even though Los Angeles sought a midyear split to simplify
accounting and gain time to negotiate service contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "I get the impression that [Yaroslavsky] just wants to get through
it," said Miscikowski, whose Westside district extends into the
Valley. "He's just sort of bulldozing through it. And all I would ask
is that they have a sound analysis of the issues."</TE>
<TE>   Another city official close to the negotiations said Yaroslavsky
sometimes appeared frustrated, even "surly."</TE>
<TE>   But the blunt-spoken supervisor, who has branded positions taken
by various camps in the debate as "nonsense," "usurious,"
"ridiculous," "bogus," "fictional" and "obstructionist," made no
apologies for nudging the process along.</TE>
<TE>   "My purpose is, first of all, to light a fire under both sides, to
get off their collective derrieres and move," Yaroslavsky said.
"Because we don't have time. If we want to get this on [the ballot]
in November, time's a-wasting."</TE>
<TE>   State Deals a Blow to Harbor Secessionists</TE>
<TE>   The panel's recommendations for the harbor area and Hollywood
largely mirror those for the Valley. Questions still loom about the
fiscal viability of a harbor city, however.</TE>
<TE>   The state Lands Commission dealt the harbor a significant setback
Tuesday by excluding tidelands around the Port of Los Angeles from
the proposed city's borders, denying it millions in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, Yaroslavsky's base will probably remain secure no
matter what becomes of the breakaway bids.</TE>
<TE>   He was reelected in March with no opposition. Among his hundreds
of campaign contributors were people on both sides of the secession
fight, including two prominent backers of Valley cityhood, car dealer
Bert Boeckmann and attorney David Fleming, as well as secession
opponent Miscikowski.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee's reports now go to the full LAFCO commission.
Some terms may yet change, as negotiations continue between Los
Angeles and the secession leaders. But on April 17, LAFCO Executive
Director Larry Calemine is expected to present his final report on
Valley secession, followed by reports on the harbor and Hollywood in
May.</TE>
<TE>   Then LAFCO must decide whether to put the secession question to
voters citywide. To win independence, the breakaway regions need
majority support not just from voters in their respective areas, but
citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's going to come to their own conclusion," Yaroslavsky
said. "They're not going to be sitting around the kitchen table the
weekend before the election saying, 'You know, honey, we didn't get
the North Hollywood police station.' They're not going to get into
that.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, this is a political decision for the
people of the city," he said. "And our job has been to make sure that
all parties are protected against unintended consequences."</TE>

<HD>Vandals Topple Gravestones in Two Santa Ana Cemeteries</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vandals rampaged through two Santa Ana cemeteries Monday night,
knocking over 33 gravestones, police said.</LD>
<LD>   "There was no graffiti with religious or ethnic connotations,"
Santa Ana Police Lt. Bob Chavez said Tuesday. "It's just
vandalism--[everything] points to kids."</LD>
<LD>   Cemetery workers discovered the damaged monuments after reporting
to work early Tuesday at Santa Ana Cemetery and adjacent St. John's
Lutheran Cemetery, both among the county's oldest, in the 1900 block
of East Santa Clara Avenue. "We just showed up for work and all the
headstones were knocked down," said Julio Amarillas, site supervisor
at the county-owned Santa Ana Cemetery.</LD>
<TE>   Most of the damaged monuments--some of which were broken in
several places despite weighing nearly 1,000 pounds--date from 1876
to the early 1900s, Amarillas said. Among them, he said, was a stone
marking the grave of Orange County's first brewer and another
memorializing two pioneer children.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty upset when I walked in today," he said. "I was in
shock--we're still trying to get hold of the families."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Amarillas said, cemetery workers have begun
repairing the monuments with a special glue, a process expected to
take until Friday. At least eight of the monuments, he said, cannot
be repaired.</TE>
<TE>   "They will be set back in the ground to look like flush markers,"
Amarillas said. "They will no longer be upright."</TE>
<TE>   Police say they have no leads in the case. "Hopefully we'll get
some people to call in and give us something to work with," Sgt. Don
Bray said.</TE>

<HD>District Ends Legal Battle Over Belmont</HD>
<DH>Schools: L.A. Unified accepts $3-million settlement from
its former lawyers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Unified School District on Tuesday ended a legal
battle with its former lawyers over the Belmont Learning Complex,
accepting $3 million in exchange for an agreement not to pursue
further litigation.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the Board of Education closes a three-year saga
that pitted the school district against one of Los Angeles' oldest
and most prestigious law firms.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Unified sued O'Melveny &amp; Myers in 1999 for allegedly ignoring
conflicts of interest and giving poor advice on the project near
downtown. That advice included a recommendation that a full
environmental impact study was not needed at the site, an abandoned
oil field that contains potentially dangerous gases.</LD>
<TE>   In January, the district lost the case. A Los Angeles Superior
Court judge said that some of its allegations were unfounded and
others could not be proved.</TE>
<TE>   The school board voted to accept the settlement Tuesday rather
than appeal. About $900,000 of the $3 million will go to pay the
district's own legal bills. The remainder will go toward construction
of Belmont, a half-finished high school that has cost the school
district about $175 million. A coalition of Latino community leaders
and school builders has been selected to finish the campus.</TE>
<TE>   "The district and the law firm both decided that the cost and
uncertainty of future litigation made this settlement reasonable,"
said Hal Kwalwasser, the district's general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement also frees the school district from having to
reimburse $700,000 to O'Melveny &amp; Myers for its litigation costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very pleased the matter has been brought to an end," said
Bob Willett, vice chairman of the firm.</TE>

<HD>Bacteria Strikes O.C. Surf Again</HD>
<DH>Environment: Unknown source closes half a mile of
Huntington State Beach. Evidence points to a local origin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County health officials indefinitely closed nearly half a mile
of Huntington State Beach's shore Tuesday after finding frequent,
puzzling spikes in bacteria levels.</LD>
<LD>   The cause remains unknown, though state and county officials
suspect beach bathrooms may be leaking human waste into the surf.
Officials could not say how long the beach will be closed but warned
it will be longer than the closures commonly caused by sewage spills.</LD>
<LD>   Signs warning of the closure were posted on the beach early
Tuesday. State park officials said the beach has few visitors now,
between spring break and Memorial Day weekend.</LD>
<TE>   The closure--2,000 feet around Magnolia Street--is reminiscent of
the summer of 1999, when health officials closed miles of Huntington
Beach for two months. The origin of that bacterial contamination has
never been determined, though many theories have been put forward and
several agencies have spent millions of dollars studying it.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a study by UC Irvine and Scripps Institution of
Oceanography showed that it is possible for a plume of partly treated
sewage that is released more than four miles off Huntington Beach to
be pushed back into the surf zone by underwater currents and the
tide.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's closure is the first time since 1999 that health
authorities have closed a beach without knowing of an actual sewage
spill. But the centralized location of the high bacteria counts and
the ratio of the various types of bacteria indicate that it's
probably a local source rather than something like the sewage plume,
said Monica Mazur, spokeswoman for the Orange County Health Care
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   State and local officials met Monday and noticed that increasingly
frequent bacteria spikes were occurring around Magnolia Street as
more people were frequenting the beach, which would increase traffic
at the two sets of bathrooms and the lifeguard headquarters there.</TE>
<TE>   Don Ito, Orange County's state parks superintendent, said the
restrooms have all been put out of service.</TE>
<TE>   A contractor will arrive today to start testing the pipes, said
Ito, who hopes to have the situation remedied before Memorial Day.
But Ito conceded that there is some uncertainty.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what's going on, actually," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mazur said she doesn't know when the beach will be reopened, but
expects it to be longer than a couple of days, the typical length of
time after a sewage spill.</TE>
<TE>   Swimming in sewage-tainted water can cause such gastrointestinal
problems as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; eye, ear, nose and throat
infections; and viral diseases such as hepatitis.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley S. Dettloff, a Huntington Beach city councilwoman and a
state coastal commissioner, hoped for a quick resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope we can get to the source real fast," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, this is something that is not a part of the great
mystery" of 1999.</TE>

<HD>E-Mails ID Priest Suspected of Abuse</HD>
<DH>Scandal: The L.A. archdiocese had claimed that the
description given by the accuser, who had forgotten the cleric's
name, was insufficient.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>E-mail exchanges between Archdiocese of Los Angeles attorneys show
that church officials had a good idea of the identity of a priest
accused of molestation in a lawsuit, although they told the
plaintiff's attorney and the media that the accuser had given them
too little information to figure out who it was.</LD>
<LD>   Lori Haigh of San Francisco was paid $1.2 million last week to
settle allegations that she was molested 20 years ago by Father John
Lenihan in Orange County and an unidentified priest from a San Pedro
Roman Catholic parish.</LD>
<LD>   She also made accusations that two other Orange County priests
ignored her pleas for help and that one of them also molested her.</LD>
<TE>   Lenihan has neither admitted to nor denied the accusation; the
other two Orange County priests say they never met her.</TE>
<TE>   Haigh, who could not remember the name of the San Pedro priest,
gave diocesan officials a number of details about him, including a
general physical description and the year she thought he had
transferred to Southern California from Ireland. She said the priest,
who was a friend of Lenihan, sexually abused her after they had
dinner at a coffee shop.</TE>
<TE>   In the archdiocese's press release on the day of the April 1
settlement, officials said that "discussions between plaintiff's
counsel and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles did not yield specific
enough information to identify this person or confirm whether the
events described by Ms. Haigh ever occurred."</TE>
<TE>   But in the e-mails, Charles Goldberg, an attorney for the
archdiocese, wrote: "We think we know who he is, but, at this moment,
are not absolutely certain who it is. Further, we have never
indicated to [Haigh's attorney Katherine K. Freberg] that we know who
he is although she has asked repeatedly."</TE>
<TE>   All three e-mails name the priest, who is listed as being on sick
leave with the archdiocese. The Times is not publishing his name
because Haigh has not formally accused him by name and he could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I should be cynical by now, but I'm shocked," Freberg said. "They
really portrayed Lori as a liar, once again making the victim the bad
guy" by saying she had provided too little information. She said that
she and Haigh are discussing further legal action against the
archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Said Freberg, "At the very least, we want an apology, and we may
have to file a lawsuit again. I'm not going to let her be victimized
again."</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said Freberg wasn't told about
the priest because church investigators weren't certain they had the
right man.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't know if the archdiocese had relayed its
suspicions to the police.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the e-mails, attorney John McNicholas wrote, "It is
possible that [the priest] could have fit that description 20 years
ago. I repeat possible. He told me very forcefully that he was never
involved with minors."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese press release said only that the church "reported
the allegations from Ms. Haigh's complaint to the Los Angeles Police
Department."</TE>
<TE>   LAPD sex-crimes detectives said they have "never heard" of the
priest named in the e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Tamberg said he would not comment specifically on the
e-mails because they are "stolen property."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the archdiocese would not reveal whether the
suspected priest ever worked in San Pedro.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys for the archdiocese did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   Freberg said she was asked by archdiocese attorneys to help them
find the unnamed priest so they could report him to police. She said
she now believes they wanted the information for "damage control."</TE>
<TE>   "You often see games played in litigation," she said. "But this
goes beyond litigation games. This goes to morals and doing the right
thing."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails became public when an anonymous source leaked them to
KFI-AM (640) and radio station officials forwarded them to The Times.
The FBI is investigating whether the e-mails were stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Because the lawsuit, filed in December, hadn't entered the formal
discovery process, the archdiocese broke no legal rules by not
turning over the priest's name.</TE>
<TE>   But an expert contacted by The Times found its tactics morally
problematic.</TE>
<TE>   "This is deeply troubling, to say the least," said Debra Rhode, a
law professor and director of the Teck Center on Legal Ethics at
Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a plaintiff in these circumstances has a justifiable
interest" in having the accused identified to protect other potential
victims. "And they sat on that information."</TE>

<HD>Will More Freeways Bring More Traffic?</HD>
<DH>Transit: Experts propose bigger, faster highways, while
critics say they'll just attract more cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 101 Freeway was loathsome and sluggish, with angry commuters
stuck in a daily crawl across the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   State transportation officials responded 10 years ago with a
$76-million freeway-widening project. It worked--for a while.</LD>
<LD>   But critics compared the fix to letting out a man's tight pants to
combat obesity.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the 101 Freeway is again exasperatingly slow, with an
average speed of about 30 mph during rush hour in each direction. And
transportation officials have kicked off a $4.5-million study to find
ways to make one of the nation's busiest freeways move freely again.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 Freeway expansion is a prime example of the thorny dilemma
facing California as officials begin to spend the largest
transportation budget in state history. The extra money will mean
bigger, better roads. But roadway expansions like the 101 project
have shown that new freeway capacity is often quickly absorbed. And
the gains from billions of tax dollars spent can seem ephemeral, at
best.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to recognize the total inefficiency of more and more road
building and the total stupidity of paving," said Jan Lundberg,
founder of the Alliance for a Paving Moratorium, a grass-roots
advocacy group based in Arcata, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Lundberg and other environmentalists say it is time California
weaned itself from further freeway construction. Adding more lanes
will only encourage more driving, they say. In the end, California's
longtime practice of building more freeways to ease gridlock will
only lead to more of the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Most roads don't stand up to a tough analysis," Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The freeway construction debate is more crucial than ever in
California and particularly in Southern California, where 19 million
residents will be joined by a projected 7 million more in the next 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the state has offered Californians a steady diet of
asphalt to meet growing transportation demands. In the last 10 years,
the California Department of Transportation has built 368 miles of
carpool lanes and 125 miles of general traffic lanes in Los Angeles
County alone. Today, the state operates a 15,000-mile freeway system
that costs nearly $800 million annually to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   Freeway Statistics Go in Wrong Direction</TE>
<TE>   It is no surprise that Californians have developed an appetite for
the open road. According to census figures, a greater percentage of
Californians drive alone to work now than a decade ago, from 71.6% in
1990 to 72.4% in 2000. In that same period, the number of miles
driven by California motorists has jumped by 18%, according to
federal transportation statistics.</TE>
<TE>   State officials have substantially increased spending on buses and
rail projects in recent years. But it is clear that Caltrans plans to
continue to feed the unsatiable demand for more freeway miles.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the year, one in every five miles of California
highways will be under repair or improvement as part of a $7-billion
transportation spending package.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making our roads wider, faster, safer," Gov. Gray Davis
said last month as he launched the $160-million widening of
Interstate 15 in the Inland Empire. "We're keeping our freeways free.
And we're getting California motorists moving again."</TE>
<TE>   Even more transportation money is coming down the road now that
voters approved Proposition 42, which is expected to pump $36 billion
from the gasoline sales tax into transportation projects over 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   But environmentalists and some transportation experts say further
freeway widening plans are folly because of the impact of "induced
demand." It is the theory that adding new freeway lanes only
encourages more driving, offering only temporary traffic relief.</TE>
<TE>   Under the induced demand theory, motorists who would normally shop
close to home might make a longer drive, on a newly widened freeway,
to a big mall across town.</TE>
<TE>   "When you reduce the cost to access a place [by cutting the drive
time] you encourage traffic to that place," said David Burwell, chief
executive of the Surface Transportation Policy Project in Washington,
D.C. "That is just straight economics."</TE>
<TE>   But the theory of induced demand is not universally accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't believe it," said David Hartgen, a professor of
transportation studies at the University of North Carolina. He
suggests that the added traffic on new freeway lanes primarily comes
from drivers who previously used surface streets or alternate highway
routes. New freeway lanes, therefore, ease congestion for an entire
region, Hartgen said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, UC Davis engineers compared 18 freeway segments that
were expanded in the 1970s with similar freeway segments that were
not improved. The research found that the traffic growth rates for
the improved and unimproved freeways were indistinguishable over a
21-year period.</TE>
<TE>   The study concluded that other factors, such as demographic
changes, population growth and the economy, play a bigger role in
creating freeway gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   "Our study finds no support for the claim that capacity expansion
generates traffic disproportionately on account of the act of
expansion itself," the study concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Getting More Drivers to Destinations Faster</TE>
<TE>   Hartgen and other transportation experts say a vast majority of
Californians will not use mass transit. They believe bigger, faster
freeways are a must. Although most new freeway lanes eventually do
become crowded, Hartgen said the extra roadway serves its purpose by
getting more motorists to their destinations faster.</TE>
<TE>   One example of a city that has lived by such thinking is Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout most of the 1990s, the Texas Department of
Transportation battled traffic congestion around Houston by spending
nearly $500 million a year on new freeway construction.</TE>
<TE>   "We were building as fast as we could," said Norman Wigington, a
spokesman for the Texas agency.</TE>
<TE>   It worked. From 1990 to 1997, Houston was one of the few major
cities in the nation to report a significant drop in freeway
congestion. But budget restraints forced a construction pullback in
the late 1990s. Freeway tie-ups and gridlock around Houston have
since shot up.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized we couldn't [afford to] build our way out of
congestion," Wigington said.</TE>
<TE>   The 101 Freeway project showed that Caltrans could not build a
permanent solution to gridlock. But the construction did serve a
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, before the 101 Freeway in the San Fernando Valley was
widened, the freeway served an average of 280,000 motorists a day at
the intersection with the San Diego Freeway. At that time, the
average speed on the 101 from Woodland Hills to downtown Los Angeles
during rush hours was 32 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion project that took nearly two years to complete added
a fifth lane in each direction, plus a sixth lane for eastbound
traffic just west of the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the 101 Freeway from the San Fernando Valley to downtown
Los Angeles during the rush hours averages about that same 32 mph.
However, the freeway now serves about 15,000 more motorists each day,
an increase of about 5%.</TE>
<TE>   More cars are on the way, though. By 2025, traffic on the busy
freeway is projected to jump by an additional 37%.</TE>
<TE>   3 Plans Launched to Fix 1 Bottleneck</TE>
<TE>   State officials already have launched three improvement plans,
totaling $50 million, to fix the bottleneck at the interchange of the
101 and the San Diego freeways. All three projects are expected to be
completed in the next six years.</TE>
<TE>   The latest 101 Freeway expansion plan will consider everything
from widening the freeway again to adding a second deck with new
vehicle lanes or a trolley line.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Cofod, a film editor who commutes along the 101 Freeway
from his home in Thousand Oaks to his job in Burbank, said he enjoyed
the benefits of the widened freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced it did help," said Cofod, who leaves home at 6:30
a.m. to miss some of the freeway's notoriously slow rush-hour
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Another widening project might ease Cofod's commute even further.
But he wonders if it makes sense to go down that road again.</TE>
<TE>   "It works, but it doesn't get people out of cars," he said. "It's
not a long-term solution to the problem."</TE>

traffic for a while, but now it's back to a crawl at rush hour.</CP>

<HD>Simon Trails Davis in Major Fund-Raising</HD>
<DH>Politics: Since primary, GOP hopeful has drawn less than
half the governor's sum in big donations. Concern felt in Republican
circles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since winning the Republican primary last month, gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon Jr. has raised less than half the amount of the
man he hopes to beat, Gov. Gray Davis, according to a Times analysis
of campaign finance reports.</LD>
<LD>   Simon's slow start in amassing the large contributions needed to
wage his fall campaign has prompted concern in Republican circles,
particularly since Davis already had $26 million in his campaign war
chest when the general election campaign opened March 6.</LD>
<LD>   Simon raised $486,900 in contributions of $5,000 or more in the
four weeks after the March 5 primary, according to reports filed with
the secretary of state's office.</LD>
<TE>   More than a third of Simon's money--at least $170,000--came from
his family. Aimee S. Bloom, his sister, donated $70,000, while two
other sisters gave $50,000 each. Simon and his relatives were also
the biggest donors to his primary campaign, with Simon himself giving
$5 million.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis took in more than twice as much as Simon--over $1.2
million in large contributions--in just three weeks after the
election.</TE>
<TE>   At this point in the general election campaign, state law requires
candidates for governor to disclose all contributions of $5,000 or
more within 10 business days of their receipt. Contributions of less
than $5,000 are not required to be disclosed until July, when
candidates must also report the cash they have on hand.</TE>
<TE>   The contribution reports analyzed by The Times cover the first
month after Simon, an asterisk in the polls as the year began,
captured the GOP nomination by handily beating former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan and Secretary of State Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   In part to boost his fund-raising, Simon is now in Washington,
D.C., where he is to meet with President Bush and Vice President Dick
Cheney today at the White House. Bush plans to headline two
fund-raising dinners for Simon later this month in Los Angeles and
San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles financier, who had never run for public office
before entering the race for governor of the nation's largest state,
attended a fund-raiser Tuesday evening with Republican governors. He
also has been courting members of California's congressional
delegation--most of whom endorsed Riordan in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Simon campaign strategist Sal Russo said that Simon's fund-raising
efforts were "right on target" and that the Bush dinners would be
Simon's biggest moneymaking events.</TE>
<TE>   "We're content with our progress," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But other Republican analysts suggested that Simon is lagging.</TE>
<TE>   Allan Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles GOP strategist, said Simon's
fund-raising has been hurt because he has not convinced many
Republican contributors that he can beat Davis in November.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon's job right now is to make people believe he can defeat
Gray Davis. If people believe he can run a winning campaign, the
money will no longer be an issue," Hoffenblum said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Observers Give Governor the Edge</TE>
<TE>   Despite Davis' lackluster popularity, many political observers
assume that the benefits of incumbency, a hefty bank account and an
experienced campaign team give the governor the edge over an untested
challenger whose political views are more conservative than those of
most Californians.</TE>
<TE>   A national Republican strategist, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the vast majority of politically aware contributors
look skeptically on the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe Simon is going to get painted into the corner as
another typical right-winger and that he's on the defensive against
Gray Davis," the strategist said.</TE>
<TE>   He said Simon should have aired television ads immediately after
the primary to define the general election campaign. "It's very
clear--Politics 101--the person who sets the agenda is the person
who's going to define the race, define the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There were one of two story lines that could have emerged after
the primary," he said. "Story line No. 1 was Gray Davis painting
Simon as out of step with California, extreme on the environment,
extreme on the [abortion] issue, extreme on gay rights and social
issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The other story line was Simon going out on TV, spending
money--he's a wealthy man--going after Gray as an ineffective,
incompetent, overly political governor. It doesn't seem like that's
happening."</TE>
<TE>   Simon strategist Russo acknowledged that rather than focusing on
fund-raising, Simon concentrated on touring the state and talking
about issues during the first two weeks after the primary.</TE>
<TE>   Russo said Bush's upcoming appearances on Simon's behalf will send
an important signal to Republican donors to get behind the GOP
candidate. Sales of $1,000 tickets to the Bush events "are going
quite briskly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign strategist Garry South said turnout at the
presidential fund-raising dinners for Simon will reflect Bush's
popularity, not Simon's.</TE>
<TE>   "The word has gone out from the White House that they want these
Bush events to be a success," he said. Simon's fund-raising may also
be hurt by a perception that he can finance the campaign himself
without large contributions, South said.</TE>
<TE>   While Simon struggles to build his bank account for the long race
to November, prodigious fund-raiser Davis continues to report a
steady stream of contributions of $5,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   By far the largest contribution--just over a quarter of a million
dollars--came from the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn.
The donation came after Davis agreed to a substantial raise for state
prison guards and recommended that five private prisons be closed.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also received large checks from unions representing
teachers, school employees, and insulators and asbestos workers--all
of whom have an interest in who holds the governor's office. Two
timber companies were among his larger donors.</TE>
<TE>   Biggest Donation From Moderate GOP Group</TE>
<TE>   Simon collected his biggest donation--$100,000--from the New
Majority political action committee. The group of moderate
Republicans based in Orange County had supported Riordan in the
primary, but they rallied behind Simon after his primary victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's of paramount importance to defeat Gray Davis," said
Larry Higby, the group's chairman. Higby said Simon would restore a
sense of confidence in the governor's office and help create a more
favorable business climate.</TE>
<TE>   The organization wants to broaden the Republican Party's appeal to
California voters by making the GOP more mainstream and less tied to
conservative positions on issues such as abortion, Higby said.</TE>
<TE>   "On the vast majority of issues, Bill Simon has our support," he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Among Simon's non-family donors was businessman Carl Lindner, a
major investor in finance and insurance as well as Chiquita bananas
and the Cincinnati Reds, who sent $25,000. A supporter of candidates
in both political parties, Lindner also has given to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Much of Simon's money continues to come from outside California,
particularly the New York City area, where his late father, former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, established a Wall Street
investment company.</TE>

<HD>El Toro's Strawberry Fields Get New Leases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the future of the former El Toro Marine base is undecided,
county supervisors agreed Tuesday to extend agricultural leases that
would provide the county $1.7 million in yearly revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The supervisors voted 3 to 2 to allow El Toro Farms (a consortium)
and three other growers to continue farming strawberries on about 500
acres through 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The board nearly postponed the decision because Supervisor Jim
Silva wanted to delay action for a week or two until the county
learns the Navy's plans for El Toro. Last month, voters again
rejected the county's airport plans for El Toro, and the Navy
subsequently announced it intends to sell all or part of the land.</LD>
<TE>   The board is expected to hear its options on El Toro at next
week's meeting. The Navy's decision is expected April 23.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Navy owns the base, I think we should wait a week or so
until the Navy makes its decision," Silva said.</TE>
<TE>   But the majority of supervisors was swayed by grower Matt
Kawamura, who said he and other growers need to order plants now for
planting in September. In addition, board member Tom Wilson, who
returned last week from a trip to Washington, D.C., said he spoke to
top Navy officials who indicated "they would honor the county's
leases."</TE>
<TE>   "They said they wouldn't be bothered by the leases and will honor
them even if El Toro is sold by the General Services Administration,"
Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Silva and Cynthia P. Coad voted against the leases. In favor were
Wilson, Chuck Smith and Todd Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who accompanied Wilson to Washington, said the county's
lease with the growers has a 180-day termination clause. Supervisors
extended the termination-notice period to allow growers time to
harvest their crops.</TE>
<TE>   "So if we develop El Toro or the Navy sells it, the growers don't
have to move until the end of their harvest cycle," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Growers needed to get lease approval in time to order plants and
prepare the soil, Kawamura said. Young strawberry plants are sown in
September and harvested in the winter through June.</TE>

<LD>There's certainly nothing funny about a former B-movie sex kitten
kicking her 6-foot-6, 215-pound, baseball-playing husband with her
high heels and grabbing his ear while he's trying to drive.</LD>
<LD>   Is there?</LD>
<LD>   Absolutely not. In fact, it sounds dangerous, especially when
considering that the woman allegedly pressed down on her husband's
foot while it was on the gas pedal.</LD>
<TE>   In 2 1/2 weeks, actress Tawny Kitaen will face the music in court
after being charged with two misdemeanor counts of inflicting
corporal injury and battery on her husband, former longtime Angels
standout Chuck Finley, now with the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   No, it's not funny, but the twisted side of me can't help but
remember slogging through a story some years back about how goo-goo
gaga Tawny was over her hunk of a husband.</TE>
<TE>   And having a general idea of how major-league clubhouses operate,
I can only imagine the lathering Finley is taking from his teammates
over making the news because his wife tore into him.</TE>
<TE>   He can take solace, however, from being a man in 2002 and not in
the Middle Ages in some European village. In those days, says a Cal
State Long Beach professor who has studied current trends in domestic
violence against men, "If a woman attacked her husband, he'd be
ridiculed. He'd ride a donkey backward through town."</TE>
<TE>   None of that for Mr. Finley, but the big left-hander now finds
himself part of the statistical pool that indicates men in America
are abused about as often as women, professor Martin Fiebert says.</TE>
<TE>   Fiebert, who has done his own research and reviewed other studies
extensively, says the consensus in the field is that women are as
likely as men to strike their partner but that--as expected--women
are more likely to be injured than men. However, he noted, men are
seriously injured in 38% of the cases in which "extreme aggression"
is used.</TE>
<TE>   "My take is that women are more likely to be more injured, but not
a lot more," Fiebert says. "The reason is that women are more likely
to use weapons in domestic situations than men--such as guns, knives
and rolling pins--and men are more likely to use physical strength."</TE>
<TE>   We've all learned to be wary of statistics, and Fiebert says
studies abound on the subject. He notes, however, that those
suggesting men are also frequent abuse victims should not be used to
minimize the threat that women face from abusive boyfriends or
spouses.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, no one laughs at abused women. But abused guys?</TE>
<TE>   "That comes from the culture of patriarchy," Fiebert says. "In
Western society, [men were] in charge of the family, and the
economics and the power of the family. Therefore, when it's
demonstrated that the person in position of power doesn't have the
power, it's an area for ridicule and humiliation."</TE>
<TE>   That remains today, but Fiebert speculates that men are slowly but
surely becoming more willing to come forward and present themselves
as victims.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Finley pressed the issue, but he wouldn't have had a
choice, said Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. Jo Escobar. Once
police arrived at the Finley home in Newport Beach and saw evidence
of suspected physical abuse on Finley, they were required by law to
pursue the matter, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think men do fear being stereotyped as a weenie or a wuss,"
Escobar says, estimating that men are the victims in about 25% of
cases. Not too long ago, she says, that figure probably would have
been closer to zero.</TE>
<TE>   "The way we now prosecute, whether a man or woman is the victim,
is to proceed as if the victim were deceased," she says. Evidence is
gathered and kept, "because we've learned that, overwhelmingly,
victims recant," Escobar says.</TE>
<TE>   "Overwhelmingly, they don't want to proceed once we're involved,
for a whole host of reasons."</TE>
<TE>   So, Kitaen will have to answer the charges. And while jokesters
poke fun at the Kitaen-Finley squabble, she'll learn there's nothing
very funny about showing up in court.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal investigators are searching for a Siberian businessman who
allegedly orchestrated the laundering of ransom money paid by the
family of one of five Los Angeles-area residents whose bodies were
found in a Northern California lake.</LD>
<LD>   Alexandr Afonin is charged with persuading Russian business
associates in the United Arab Emirates to accept the $234,000 in
ransom wired by the family of North Hollywood businessman Alex
Umansky in December.</LD>
<LD>   An FBI spokesman said Tuesday that authorities are looking for
Afonin "wherever he may be, including Russia."</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Russian Interior Ministry, however, said that
as of late last week, it had not been asked by U.S. officials to join
in the hunt.</TE>
<TE>   According to a federal affidavit, the ransom was transferred in
chunks over the course of a month--from the San Fernando Valley to a
New York bank, then to the United Arab Emirates and Latvia. Some was
wired back to an account held by an upscale aquarium store on Ventura
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks, the affidavit says.</TE>
<TE>   The two store owners--Iouri Mikhel and Jurijus Kadamovas--have
been charged in two of the kidnappings. Also charged in the
kidnapping plot are Petro Krylov of West Hollywood and Ainar Altmanis
of Sherman Oaks. Two of Afonin's associates from the Emirates--Andrei
Liapine and Andrei Agueev--have been charged in connection with the
alleged ransom payment, court documents say.</TE>
<TE>   All the defendants have roots in the former Soviet Union. They are
being held in Los Angeles without bail. None has been accused of
murder, but the U.S. attorney's office has not ruled out additional
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Altmanis directed the FBI last month to New Melones Lake near
Sonora, where all five victims were found, according to documents.
Altmanis is cooperating with prosecutors as part of an immunity deal,
the documents say.</TE>
<TE>   An arrest warrant has been issued for Afonin. He is a resident of
Barnaul--an industrial city in Russia near the Kazakhstan border--and
the former owner of an import-export business based in the emirate of
Sharjah, according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   The company "specialized in shipping products in and out of the
U.A.E.," and had once employed Liapine, who also hailed from Barnaul.</TE>
<TE>   During business trips to the U.A.E., Afonin stayed at the
extravagant Jumeirah Beach Hotel on Dubai's coast, the documents say.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials in Afonin's hometown said they have an address
for the fugitive and three firearm licenses in his name. He has no
criminal record, including traffic violations, and was not listed as
being sought by any law enforcement agency, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Liapine was in Dubai to start a business for his
old boss, according to the affidavit. In early December, Afonin
reportedly flew to the U.A.E. from Russia to ask Agueev--another
former employee--if he would use his account to receive a $234,000
transfer from New York. Afonin allegedly said it was seed money for
the new business.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev agreed to accept the money, turn it over to Liapine and
call Afonin at the Jumeirah hotel when the transaction was complete,
the affidavit says.</TE>
<TE>   Umansky vanished from the San Fernando Valley a few days later.
His family sent $235,000 to a New York bank, following instructions
faxed from Russia, the affidavit says. The money was forwarded to
Agueev's business account between Dec. 22 and Jan. 7, according to
the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Agueev withdrew money in local currency and turned it over to
Liapine, who sent it on to Latvia, the affidavit says.</TE>
<TE>   A large amount went to a company called Glenstream Ventures in
Riga, the Latvian capital. Glenstream later wired almost $40,000 to
an account held by Designed Water World, the aquarium shop in the
Valley owned by Mikhel and Kadamovas, both of Encino, the documents
say.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhel and Kadamovas are charged with kidnapping Umansky and
businessman George Safiev, a Russian who had been living in Beverly
Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The bodies of Umansky, Safiev, West Hollywood accountant Rita
Pekler and aspiring film producer Nick Kharabadze were pulled from
the reservoir in March.</TE>
<TE>   Last October, the body of Sherman Oaks real estate developer Meyer
Muscatel was found floating in the lake, his hands bound and his head
in a plastic bag.</TE>

<HD>2 Skinheads Sought in Attack on 3 Jewish Boys</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARIOT LOUIMA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police investigators are looking for skinheads suspected of attacking
three Jewish teenagers in a West Los Angeles neighborhood last
weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old boys, all wearing yarmulkes, were walking home
from a friend's house at 12:30 a.m. Saturday when two men with
closely shaved heads approached them near Reeves and Cashio streets
in Beverlywood.</LD>
<LD>   "For no other reason than that they were Jews, one of the men
punched one of the boys," Deputy Chief David Kalish said.</LD>
<TE>   The attackers knocked two of the boys to the ground and continued
kicking and punching them, Kalish said. The men reportedly shouted
anti-Semitic slurs, including "Heil Hitler," before fleeing in a
dark-colored car with two other people.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the teenagers were "beaten pretty badly," suffering cuts
and bruises on their faces and necks, Kalish said. One needed several
stitches above an eye. The third boy was unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference Tuesday in the predominantly Jewish
neighborhood of about 1,400 families, Kalish said the incident is a
"top priority" for the department.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 28 of 97 hate crimes in West Los Angeles were directed
at Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, an associate dean at the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, said Tuesday that it was no coincidence that the hate crime
occurred two days before Yom Hoshoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.</TE>
<TE>   The recent proliferation of hate propaganda on the Internet and
elsewhere has linked American white supremacist groups with terrorist
organizations abroad in what Cooper described as "a convergence of
ideologies, a transnational hate."</TE>

<HD>Ocean to Get Kelp From Its Friends</HD>
<DH>Environment: Coastal Commission OKs reforestation off
Crystal Cove and Malibu to rebuild algae beds decimated by pollution,
sea urchins and more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to reforest Southern California's ocean floor, the California
Coastal Commission on Tuesday approved plans to plant giant kelp off
Crystal Cove State Park and Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   The Coastal Commission unanimously approved the projects, which
will be carried out by Orange CoastKeeper and Santa Monica BayKeeper.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be a real enhancement and help get some kelp areas
that we [historically] had along the coast rebuilt," said Shirley S.
Dettloff, a commissioner and Huntington Beach councilwoman.</LD>
<TE>   Ocean floors along the Southland used to be blanketed by tangled
canopies of leafy green kelp. But aerial photographs reveal that more
than 80% of historic kelp beds off Southern California shores have
been lost, and the figure jumps to more than 90% in Orange County,
said Nancy Caruso, CoastKeeper's marine biologist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mixture of problems that have caused the demise of the
kelp," she said, ticking off as contributing factors pollution,
runoff, sediment, El Nino and a high population of sea urchins, which
eat kelp.</TE>
<TE>   "The combination of those things have really kept kelp from coming
back to where it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   Five groups, including the CoastKeeper and the BayKeeper, received
a federal grant of nearly $1.5million to reforest the ocean floor.
The Crystal Cove and Malibu projects are the first funded by the
grant. The remainder will be off Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Diego
counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County and Santa Monica Bay groups will grow baby kelp
on tiny pieces of unglazed, unleaded bathroom tile. Once the kelp
reaches five centimeters long, the tiles will be attached to rocky
reefs with rubber bands. The kelp will grow up to two feet per day.
In a year or so, after the kelp matures, divers will remove the tiles
and rubber bands.</TE>
<TE>   The project leaders are hoping that, at least in cleaner areas
such as Crystal Cove, the kelp will be able to thrive. Right now,
they said, there is not enough adult kelp offshore to generate baby
kelp.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the kelp will act as both a habitat and a food source
for wildlife. Humans also will benefit; among other things, kelp is
used to make processed cheese, instant noodles, chocolate syrup, dog
food, ice cream, beer, cake frosting and Band-Aids, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Your frosting's really smooth and creamy because of algae,"
Caruso said.</TE>

<LD>Liar, liar ... No, really, I'm telling the truth when I say that
authorities in Newport Beach responded to a report of smoke in a
garage and found only some pants on fire. Nobody in 'em, luckily.</LD>
<LD>   On the road: While visiting an island near Hong Kong, Ken Nelson
of Palm Springs noticed a somewhat disquieting sign (see photo). "No
one was in the water,'' he added.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking of sharks: Disney, as you may have read, is trying to
unload the Anaheim Angels. Which makes me wonder if one of the
prospective buyers might be the offramp entrepreneur who once tried
to acquire another local team (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Don't know much about geography: In the magazine of a pilots
association, David Anderson of West Hollywood found evidence that
Oceanside has washed inland, to damp Northern California (see
accompanying). Luckily, the city long ago abandoned the slogan "Tan
Your Hide in Oceanside."</TE>
<TE>   Dueling suburbs: Enough talk about the San Fernando Valley, future
home of the city of the Valley or Camelot or 29 Malls or whatever.
The other valley has some ambitious plans, too.</TE>
<TE>   The San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership was quoted as saying
that Pepperdine's plans to build a branch campus in Pasadena would
hasten efforts to "promote the San Gabriel Valley as the intellectual
capital of the world." Who needs Pepperdine? The San Gabriel
Valley--specifically, San Dimas--already is known as the setting for
the Keanu Reeves classic "Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Adventure."</TE>
<TE>   Get me to the shore on time: "Nightmare Honeymoons" was the
subject of a survey on radio station KOST the other day. My favorite
story was told by a woman who eloped to Hawaii with her fiance--and
five members of his family.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't want us to be alone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Upon arrival, she got into an argument with her fiance in the
lobby. Her mother-in-law-to-be, it turned out, "wanted adjoining
rooms to our suite."</TE>
<TE>   Things got worse. The best man dropped out two days before the
wedding. On the big day, the groom decided to go marlin fishing. He
promised to be back for the 2 p.m. nuptials. He made it, smelling of
the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The morning after the wedding, the phone rang at 7. It was the
mother-in-law, informing her son he had left some of his clothes in
her room.</TE>
<TE>   The KOST caller said she and the marlin fisherman are still
married and she's come to know her mother-in-law as a "wonderful
person."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds logical to me: The police log of the Los Alamitos-News
Enterprise reported that, in Cypress, "a man parked in the alley
behind a residence for four nights said he got better cellular phone
reception there."</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope she didn't bite too: The "Call of the Week" in the same
police log concerned a woman who was arrested "after she claimed she
was Mike Tyson and struck another woman walking nearby."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Linda Tervillian sent along this Internet quip
illustrating why husbands are not secretaries. A note that a spouse
left for his wife on the refrigerator door said: "Someone from the
Gyna College called. They said Pabst beer is normal."</TE>

<HD>10 Valley Massage Parlors Hit in Sting</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing in front of Samoa Acupressure in Reseda, Los Angeles City
Atty. Rocky Delgadillo announced criminal charges Tuesday against
similar massage parlors suspected of prostitution or operating
without proper licensing.</LD>
<LD>   Samoa Acupressure, which closed March 8, was one of 10 businesses
in the San Fernando Valley purporting to provide legal massage,
acupressure or aromatherapy that were targeted in February by the Los
Angeles Police Department in a sting.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation yielded prostitution charges against six
businesses and charges of operating as a massage therapist without a
license against five.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm happy to say the business behind me ... has been forced to
close its doors," Delgadillo said, calling it "a haven for
prostitution."</TE>
<TE>   Charges against four of the businesses are to be filed in Van Nuys
and San Fernando courts today. The remaining six cases were filed two
weeks ago and are pending trial.</TE>
<TE>   Det. Rick McElroy, who oversaw the sting, said that in one night,
undercover officers made arrests at all 10 locations. "This is just
one night's effort," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vice officers used L.A. Express, a sexually explicit newspaper
that advertises massage services, as a starting point, McElroy said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not hard to find these places," he said. "They're all over
the city--there's no boundaries."</TE>
<TE>   An undercover officer would pay for a massage at the front door
and in many instances would be led to a back room and offered sex for
money, McElroy said.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley is a popular place to conduct prostitution under the
guise of massage because of its many strip malls, which make it easy
for owners to move in and out quickly, said Sgt. Jesse Puente of the

<TE>   Undercover officers found immigrant Korean and Mexican women
living in some of the stores, Puente said. In an earlier
investigation at DT Therapy on Winnetka Avenue and Saticoy Street,
which advertised aromatherapy, police found Mexican and South
American women sleeping on mats on the floor, he added.</TE>
<TE>   DT Therapy closed in September after a two-month investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the place that opened our eyes, that there was a need to
check on places like this," Puente said.</TE>

<HD>Mother of Suspect Killed in Fiery Standoff Files Claim</HD>
<DH>Courts: She says sheriff's deputies used excessive force on
her son, who fatally shot an officer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of James Allen Beck, the former Arcadia police officer who
died in a fiery shootout in Stevenson Ranch last year, has filed a
wrongful-death claim against the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, lawyers said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In her claim, Donna Beck accuses the department of using excessive
force against her son, who officials say shot and killed a sheriff's
deputy during the standoff. The mother alleges that deputies let his
two-story house burn down while he and his dog were inside, prevented
firefighters from saving him and later altered evidence.</LD>
<LD>   The county counsel's office has rejected the claim on the grounds
that the documents were not filed by the six-month deadline. But
Beck's attorney, Carol A. Watson, said the claim was filed on time.</LD>
<TE>   Such claims commonly precede a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to cover up the wrongful death of James Beck, deputy
sheriffs and others tampered with and destroyed physical evidence at
the scene, failed and refused to maintain the scene intact for
coroner's investigators, and razed the residence before permitting
[Donna Beck] or her agents or investigators to have access to it,"
the claim says.</TE>
<TE>   Beck is seeking unspecified damages for the loss of her son, his
funeral expenses and her anguish over his death.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department denied her allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no attempt to cover anything up," said Capt. Frank
Merriman of the sheriff's homicide bureau. "We didn't tamper with
anything."</TE>
<TE>   The department was criticized a few months ago for the way it
handled the investigation into Beck's death.</TE>
<TE>   Coroner's investigators had said they were frustrated because
deputies kept them from Beck's remains for a day after the Aug. 31
shootout and then required them to sift through the crime-scene
debris at night.</TE>
<TE>   Merriman acknowledged Tuesday that sheriff's investigators
"weren't totally familiar" with the coroner's protocol that calls for
investigations to be conducted in daylight.</TE>
<TE>   "We will do it that way next time. That was just a
misunderstanding," Merriman said. "Nothing was lost. Nothing was
damaged."</TE>
<TE>   But a coroner's report said that "because of mixing of debris at
the scene prior to the arrival of coroner personnel ... information
was lost." A coroner's official could not be reached Tuesday for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's report did not include a cause of death because it
said Beck's body was too badly burned.</TE>
<TE>   Beck, a 35-year-old felon who had a history of stockpiling
weapons, opened fire at sheriff's deputies and federal agents who
tried to serve him with a search warrant. During the three-hour
shootout, Beck shot and killed Deputy Hagop "Jake" Kuredjian,
officials said. After deputies lobbed a hot tear-gas canister into an
upstairs bedroom, the house became engulfed in flames.</TE>
<TE>   County firefighters sprayed water on adjacent homes but didn't try
to save Beck or his house because they believed it would be too
dangerous, officials said.</TE>

<LD>The arraignment of South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles, charged with
making criminal threats, was postponed to Thursday in a hearing at
South Gate Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   During a brief appearance Tuesday, Robles smiled at supporters who
filled much of the courtroom. He spoke only to answer several
questions from a prosecutor.</LD>
<LD>   The arraignment was delayed so attorneys can prepare written
arguments regarding Robles' bail amount, which prosecutors have
recommended be set at $500,000. Robles is charged with seven felony
counts involving alleged threats against four victims, including two
state legislators and a police officer.</LD>

157-acre property near the junction of the Harbor and San Diego
freeways.</LD>
<TE>   Plans called for developing the property into a retail outlet
mall. But Seay failed to disclose his personal stake in the site, the

sending menacing letters to a Los Angeles County Superior Court
judge, including one that threatened to bomb his courthouse and
another warning that his daughter and grandson would be "hung or

<LD>   Mimi Villegas Galdi, 35, a former dental assistant, was taken into
custody by FBI agents at her home without incident.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the alleged threats were directed at Judge William Beverly

Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Beverly had dismissed Galdi's complaint against a
court commissioner in Torrance who had previously enjoined her from
contacting former co-workers at a dental clinic.</TE>

<HD>Runoff Appears Likely for Mayor of Long Beach</HD>
<DH>Elections: Issues pertaining to growth dominate as voters
go to the polls throughout Los Angeles County.</DH>

<LD>A termed-out incumbent who ran a longshot write-in campaign and the
vice mayor appeared headed toward a mayoral runoff election late
Tuesday in Long Beach, California's fifth-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   Dan Baker, a Long Beach councilman of two years, appeared slightly
ahead with 30% of the vote in early absentee ballot counting. Beverly
O'Neill, the mayor of eight years whose name could not appear on the
ballot because of term limits, was running a close second with 29%.
Tagging behind them were Councilman Ray Grabinski; Norm Ryan, who
wrote a successful utility tax reduction proposition; coach Bob
Livingstone; police Corp. John Stolp; and contractor David Wong.</LD>
<LD>   Concerns about growth echoed throughout the 13 other city
elections in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   Voters in Long Beach, a city of 461,000, passed in 1994 a two-term
limit that allows for a write-in candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Also up for grabs were five of the city's nine council district
seats and the post of city prosecutor. (The city attorney and city
auditor were running unopposed for reelection).</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach mayor doesn't vote but has veto power and
considerable influence in this port city.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor makes all commission appointments--the City Council can
only reject them, not make them--including coveted appointments to
the Harbor Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles share a single basin which
is the busiest in the nation and which drives the economies of
numerous smaller cities in southeast L.A. County.</TE>
<TE>   In Malibu, Sharon Barovsky and John Wall were in the lead for two
of the city's council seats.</TE>
<TE>   In South Pasadena, voters appeared headed toward passing Measure
U, a renewal of the 5% utility user's tax, with 63.7% of absentee
ballots in favor.</TE>
<TE>   LAX Expansion Major Issue in El Segundo</TE>
<TE>   In El Segundo, the possible LAX expansion remained a major issue
in Tuesday's election for two council seats. Candidates William V.
Wegner and Spencer Shakstad expressed a willingness to negotiate with
expansion project planners during the campaign, while incumbents
Kelly McDowell and John Gaines opposed expansion. Early results were
not available.</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Clarita--where growth was a campaign issue in the city
where the population is expected to swell by 50,000 over the next 20
years--three of fivecouncil seats were up for grabs. Incumbent Frank
Ferry, who calls himself "The Road Warrior" because of his emphasis
on road improvements, appeared to be leading, with Laurene Weste in
second place, trailed by Marsha McLean and Jan Heidt.</TE>
<TE>   In Culver City, residents were voting for city clerk and two
council seats.</TE>

<HD>Sex Case Verdict Reduced</HD>
<DH>Pasadena: Attorney for teen victim says councilman's
ex-wife got a special deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years after the ex-wife of a Pasadena city councilman pleaded
no contest to a felony charge of having sex with a minor, a judge
reduced her conviction to a misdemeanor.</LD>
<LD>   Michelle Holden, 38, the former wife of Pasadena City Councilman
Chris Holden, had been serving three years' probation for the 1998
offense.</LD>
<LD>   Holden pleaded no contest to a single felony count of having
sexual intercourse with a minor, a 15-year-old boy who was the
baby-sitter for Holden's three children, in May 1999. At that time,
she was ordered to seek counseling and undergo random drug testing.
Under the plea bargain, she avoided having to register as a sex
offender.</LD>
<TE>   Holden's lawyer, Mark Geragos, said he is extremely pleased with
the decision by Superior Court Judge Joseph DeVano, which effectively
dismissed the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy she has put this behind her," Geragos said. "She has
all kinds of plans that now she can go forward with."</TE>
<TE>   By dismissing the case, DeVano spared Holden the stigma of being
branded a felon, Geragos said.</TE>
<TE>   Leo Terrell, the attorney representing the boy and his family,
called the reversal of the conviction an outrage.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is the former wife of the former mayor of the city," Terrell
said. "The example she has set is, 'I should get this reduced because
I am special.' She should be made an example of because of her status
in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Terrell said that although Holden agreed last year to pay $25,000
to settle a civil suit against her, she has yet to pay any part of
that settlement.</TE>
<TE>   In early 2000, Holden filed for bankruptcy, declaring $1 million
in debts and $364,000 in assets.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the prospects of Holden paying the settlement, Geragos
said: "I told [Terrell] at the time it was uncollectable, and I am a
man of my word."</TE>

<HD>Fees for Billboard Inspections Urged</HD>
<DH>Ads: Council panel says firms should be assessed for each
of their signs in the city. Industry objects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sign companies would have to pay an annual fee of as much as $477 for
each billboard they own to finance an inspection program under an
ordinance recommended Tuesday by a Los Angeles City Council panel.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal drew strong opposition from major billboard company
representatives, including George Manyak, Western regional president
for Clear Channel Outdoor.</LD>
<LD>   Manyak told the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management
Committee that the proposal would cost his company $1 million a year.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an excessive tax that they cannot justify," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Councilman Ed Reyes said the industry has to cover the cost of
addressing the proliferation of illegal billboards, which may be as
high as 40% of the city's 10,000 billboards.</TE>
<TE>   "I have received more complaints of blight about these billboards"
than other issues, Reyes told industry leaders during a hearing at
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would charge a fee of $477 per billboard the first
year to pay for an inventory of all billboards, research to determine
whether they have permits and inspection of about one-third of the
billboards.</TE>
<TE>   The fee would decrease gradually as more billboards were
inspected, until in the fifth year companies would pay $235 per
billboard to fund an ongoing annual inspection program.</TE>
<TE>   However, Maria Gobic of Vista Media said the fee would add up for
large firms, such as hers, which has 3,000 billboards in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems a little ridiculous that we continue to pay for
inspections," said Ken Spiker Jr., a lobbyist for the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who authored the original ordinance calling
for annual inspections, said the plea of financial hardship is not
believable.</TE>
<TE>   "For an industry that makes tens of thousands of dollars per month
for certain signs to say they can't afford this fee is so laughable
it almost destroys their credibility on everything else they say," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Teachers Pick Tough New Union Leader</HD>
<DH>Labor: John Perez will likely lead United Teachers in
contentious contract talks over a 5% raise, while district says it is
pressed for funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DUKE HELFAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles teachers union on Tuesday elected a former high
school teacher as its new president, narrowly choosing the more
confrontational of two candidates to likely lead contract
negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   John Perez, 55, will head United Teachers-Los Angeles through
contentious contract talks with the Los Angeles Unified School
District when he takes office July 1 if a settlement is not reached
before then.</LD>
<LD>   The union is seeking a 5% raise for its teachers this year--an
increase that would cost the district about $125 million. District
officials said they have little if any money for a raise because L.A.
Unified already faces a $428-million budget deficit.</LD>
<TE>   "This district has to make the classroom the No. 1 priority,"
Perez said in an interview after his victory. "The classroom is
always the last priority."</TE>
<TE>   Perez, currently a union vice president, edged another union vice
president by 98 votes in a runoff for the organization's top job.
Perez received 4,966 votes. Becki Robinson, a former elementary
school teacher with a less strident approach to contract talks,
received 4,868 votes.</TE>
<TE>   The union represents about 47,000 teachers, librarians,
counselors, school nurses and other school employees in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Members received an average 11.5% raise last year.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides agreed at that time to renegotiate salaries this year
and next year as part of a three-year contract.</TE>
<TE>   Perez spent the last dozen years in various vice presidential
positions in the local union. He also taught for 21 years at
Roosevelt High School.</TE>
<TE>   He will replace union President Day Higuchi, who must step down
because of term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Like Higuchi, Perez is known for tough talk in contract
negotiations. "I've been on strike," Perez said, referring to a
nine-day walkout by teachers in 1989. "I'm not afraid of it."</TE>
<TE>   District officials said they look forward to working with Perez
and the teachers who won other spots on the union's governing board.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's time for us to have a renewed relationship [with the
union] that helps kids," said school board President Caprice Young.</TE>
<TE>   In another labor situation involving the district, the school
board approved a motion Tuesday encouraging 700 striking school bus
drivers and their employer to reach an amicable and expedient
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   But school Supt. Roy Romer balked at a Teamsters' request to take
a more active role in the talks.</TE>
<TE>   On strike for a week, members of Teamsters Local 572 have been
negotiating unsuccessfully with Laidlaw Education Services, the
district's biggest transportation contractor.</TE>
<TE>   No new talks were scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 20,000 students have been affected, getting to school
late on buses operated by substitute drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Teamsters' spokesman Don Owens said he was encouraged by the
board's motion, calling it a good start.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely would like to sit back down with the company and
work out a fair agreement," Owens said.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw Vice President Jim Ferraro also said he wants to get back
to negotiations and that he agrees with Romer's position on keeping
the district out of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   "The board is in a deficit situation as it stands," he said. "The
union's contract is with Laidlaw, not with LAUSD."</TE>

<HD>Man, 43, Suspected of Killings in Rosemead Is Held in
Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities said a man whose obsession with his ex-girlfriend in 1999
caused him to storm into a Rosemead home and kill four members of a
family has been arrested in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Evelio Rivera Zacarias, 43, was arrested Sunday in the state of
Zacatecas, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Since the killings, Zacarias has lived freely in Mexico. The
Mexican government would not extradite him because of its policy of
not returning people to the United States who could face the death
penalty. It's not clear why Mexican authorities decided to arrest him
now.</LD>
<TE>   Zacarias will be tried in Mexico for the slayings, the Sheriff's
Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Zacarias was jealous because his ex-girlfriend,
the mother of his two children, was dating a man named Jaime Pacheco,
48. On Aug. 9, 1999, Zacarias allegedly followed the couple to the
home of Pacheco's brother, Oscar, where authorities said he began
shooting.</TE>
<TE>   He allegedly shot 14-year-old Andy Pacheco, Oscar's son, as the
boy played a video game. Also killed were the Pacheco brothers and
Victor Flores, 49, Jaime Pacheco's brother-in-law. Two other people
were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Walking outside, authorities said, Zacarias was surprised to find
Andy had managed to stagger to the sidewalk, where he collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities and family members said Zacarias kicked the boy and
shot him dead as his mother watched from a neighbor's home. Zacarias
then allegedly kidnapped a woman at the home and raped her in a car.
She was later released.</TE>
<TE>   A cousin, who drove Zacarias to Mexico, was eventually arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican prosecutors will try Zacarias for two of the killings, but
it's unclear which ones.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutors Boost Child-Porn Claim Against O.C. Judge</HD>
<DH>Courts: They say Ronald Kline stored more than 1,500 images
of boys and dispute the defense's contention that a hacker could have
planted them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal prosecutors have dramatically increased the number of nude
child photos they claim Orange County Judge Ronald C. Kline stored on
his computer and assert it would have been virtually impossible for a
hacker to plant them, according to court documents obtained Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say more than 1,500 computer images of young boys were
found at Kline's home, including nude and "hard-core" photographs
showing children having sex. Until now, federal prosecutors had
placed the figure at more than 100.</LD>
<LD>   Additionally, prosecutors allege many of the images were
downloaded well before a Canadian tipster hacked his way into Kline's
computer last year. The hacker passed on information about the photos
to an Internet watchdog group in Colorado, which in turn alerted
police.</LD>
<TE>   Kline's attorneys have suggested that the hacker could have
planted the photos himself. They have also questioned whether the
unidentified hacker was acting as a police agent when he broke into
the judge's home computer.</TE>
<TE>   If the hacker was acting on behalf of law enforcement, a judge
would probably throw out the evidence taken from Kline's home, ruling
that it was obtained as a result of an illegal search.</TE>
<TE>   But in a sharply worded response filed Monday, prosecutors
dismissed the defense attorneys' theory as "farfetched" and
highlighted Kline's admissions to detectives about his sexual
attraction to young boys.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of [Kline's] insatiable interest in naked young boys,
the 'tipster did it' defense is ludicrous," prosecutors wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, declined to comment on the new
filing. Kline, 61, has pleaded not guilty to six federal charges of
possessing child pornography. The charges are based on the number of
locations--such as hard drives and floppy discs--where images are
stored, not the number of images.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Deirdre Eliot said prosecutors may file a new
count against Kline once they finish analyzing images found on his
courthouse computer.</TE>
<TE>   Kline also faces separate state charges of child molestation, to
which he pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   The latest filing by prosecutors provides new details about an
interview Kline gave detectives on Nov. 5, four days before he was
criminally charged. The judge allegedly told police that he never
intentionally downloaded illegal pornography and deleted any pictures
that might violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I know what the law is," Kline told detectives, according
to court records. "If I looked at anything inappropriate off the
Internet, I didn't mean to keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Kline allegedly told detectives that he believes children can be
"emotionally hurt" having sex with adults so he involves himself only
with boys who are interested.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to take advantage of somebody who doesn't want to,"
Kline told detectives, according to the court filing.</TE>
<TE>   In the new court papers, prosecutors acknowledge that the hacker
helped Canadian police with one Internet-related case. But they
strongly denied he ever acted as a police agent. Indeed, prosecutors
contend he was actually considered a "potential suspect" in at least
three U.S. Customs Service investigations of child pornographers.</TE>
<TE>   In one 1998 case, undercover customs agents watched a man in New
York download a computer movie from the hacker that showed boys
having sex. In another investigation last year, agents searched the
home of a child pornographer in California and found the name and
address of the hacker on a piece of paper. There is no evidence that
the agents in those cases ever tried to contact the hacker.</TE>
<TE>   Kline's attorneys have asked U.S. District Judge Consuelo B.
Marshall to allow them to question the hacker about his relationship
with law enforcement. Prosecutors have opposed the request. Marshall
is scheduled to rule on the matter in Los Angeles on April 22.</TE>

<LD>County health officials indefinitely closed nearly half a mile of
Huntington State Beach's shore--2,000 feet surrounding Magnolia
Street--on Tuesday after finding frequent and puzzling increases in
bacteria levels.</LD>
<LD>   The cause remains unknown, although state and county officials
suspect beach bathrooms may be leaking human waste into the surf.
Officials could not say how long the beach would be closed, but
warned it would be longer than the closures commonly caused by sewage
spills.Officials said the beach has few visitors between now and the
Memorial Day weekend.</LD>

<HD>UC Riverside Appointment a Breakthrough</HD>
<DH>Education: Latino groups cheer the choice of astrophysicist
France A. Cordova as the school's next chancellor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California named its first Latina chancellor
Tuesday, choosing astrophysicist France A. Cordova to take the helm
of the UC Riverside campus.</LD>
<LD>   Cordova, 54, now vice chancellor for research at UC Santa Barbara,
will lead a campus that is the fastest growing and most ethnically
diverse in the UC system.</LD>
<LD>   Her selection followed a determined campaign by Latino politicians
and campus and community activists to bring a Latino chancellor to
Riverside.</LD>
<TE>   But UC President Richard C. Atkinson, who recommended Cordova to
the UC Regents after a three-month search, downplayed the role of the
activists' campaign. In brief remarks during a telephone news
conference, Atkinson focused on Cordova's career and education as a
scientist, touching on everything from her PhD from the California
Institute of Technology to her stint as the chief scientist at NASA.</TE>
<TE>   "She has truly had a distinguished scientific career," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Atkinson said, Cordova has had a "truly
outstanding" record in reaching out to underrepresented minorities.</TE>
<TE>   In the news conference following a 16-0 vote by the regents
approving her selection, Cordova said her chief challenge would be
managing continued growth at UC Riverside. Last fall it enrolled
14,429 students, a 10% increase from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The expanding student population, she said, "means growth in the
faculty and staff. And I think that's one of the very attractive
things about taking this position, and it's one of the big
challenges."</TE>
<TE>   Other top goals, she said, would be raising funds from private
sources and finding "more ways to get more people prepared for higher
education, especially underrepresented minorities."</TE>
<TE>   Although Cordova will become the first Latina in the 134-year
history of the UC system to head one of its nine campuses, there was
one previous Latino chancellor: poet and literary critic Tomas
Rivera, who headed UC Riverside from 1979 until his death of a heart
attack in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the
Latino Legislative Caucus, said he was overjoyed by the
appointment--even though Cordova wasn't on a list of Latino
candidates that he and legislative colleagues submitted to the UC
system's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "These are incredibly important appointments," Firebaugh said. A
chancellor, he said, "conceivably has the ability to lead a dialogue
on education statewide."</TE>
<TE>   "The University of California is absolutely the jewel of
California higher education. And to lead one of those campuses is to
be offered a pulpit from which to lead on education matters,"
Firebaugh added.</TE>
<TE>   Armando Navarro, chairman of the ethnic studies department at UC
Riverside and the leader in the campaign for a Latino chancellor,
agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a glass ceiling that's hard to penetrate or break, and
apparently there's been a crack created through the success of Dr.
France Cordova. There is hope for us now."</TE>
<TE>   Judith Rodin, the president of the University of Pennsylvania who
in 1994 became the first woman to head an Ivy League school, said
Cordova "will be looked to as a role model and mentor."</TE>
<TE>   She said Cordova will need to use the "mantle" of being a
ground-breaker wisely and well, because being first gets a lot of
attention.</TE>
<TE>   Cordova's personal history crosses the globe. Her father was from
Mexico and her mother was a fifth-generation American of Irish
descent. Cordova , the eldest of 12 children, was born in Paris,
where her father served as a diplomat with the U.S. State Department.</TE>
<TE>   The family later moved to Southern California, and Cordova
attended high school in La Puente. From there she went to Stanford
University, receiving a bachelor's degree in English before turning
to science and earning a PhD in physics from Caltech in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Cordova assumes her new job July 1. She replaces Raymond L.
Orbach, who resigned early this year after 10 years in the post to
become director of the Office of Science in the U.S. Department of
Energy.</TE>
<TE>   As chancellor, Cordova's salary will be $265,200, the same amount
that Orbach earned.</TE>
<TE>   Cordova is married to Christian J. Foster, a science educator, and
she has two teenage children.</TE>

<DH>Secession: State Lands Commission fears a new city might be
unable to provide protection.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Lands Commission voted unanimously Tuesday to
recommend that a harbor-area city not include most of the land
occupied by the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the commission said the city of Los Angeles should keep
control of port land under a trust agreement with the state. The
property includes all of the underwater areas around the port and 67%
of the dry land.</LD>
<LD>   The commission, which oversees the port tidelands, expressed
concern that if the harbor area secedes from Los Angeles, a new city
might not have the money to provide sufficient police and fire
protection for the port.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, commissioners said, a harbor city would not be bound
by the agreement under which Los Angeles operates the port.</TE>
<TE>   The panel's recommendation will be considered by the Local Agency
Formation Commission in its review of the harbor secession proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists want the tidelands so that a harbor city could
influence development at the expansion-hungry port and collect fees
and taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The Local Agency Formation Commission is to rule next month on
whether the proposed city would be financially healthy. Two
preliminary reports have raised serious questions about the area's
financial stability.</TE>
<TE>   The lands commission said it might reconsider if a harbor city
proves viable. Secessionists plan to study whether LAFCO can modify
the boundary on its own.</TE>

<HD>Campbell Wants Spitzer's Office</HD>
<DH>Politics: Turned out of his Assembly seat by term limits,
he wants to swap jobs with the supervisor, who's trying to go to
Sacramento.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assemblyman Bill Campbell, who must leave his seat because of term
limits, became the first candidate to announce that he will run for
Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer's seat should Spitzer be
elected in November to Campbell's legislative seat. Campbell (R-Villa
Park) declared his intentions Tuesday--seven months before the
November election, when Spitzer faces Democrat Bea Foster, a Santa
Ana teacher. The winner will be sworn in Dec. 2. Spitzer is favored
because the district has a majority of Republican voters.</LD>
<LD>   If Spitzer wins, the election to replace him would occur in
February. It would be the first such replacement election; an
initiative passed last month gives voters the job of filling
supervisorial vacancies. In the past, the governor appointed
replacements. The new county charter requires an election between 56
and 70 days after a vacancy occurs, with the top vote-getter taking
office immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Campbell, a former Assembly Republican minority leader, already
has several endorsements for the county seat, including Sheriff
Michael S. Carona, Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Gary

<HD>Suit Seeks $2 Billion From 4 Energy Firms</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer accused four energy companies
Tuesday of gouging Californians and demanded at least $2 billion in
penalties.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer filed four lawsuits in state court alleging violation of
California's business and professions code. The suits are the latest
in a series of actions by Lockyer to recoup money Californians paid
for electricity in 2001. They won't be the last, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "No business who rips off Californians should expect us to walk
away from that fight," said Lockyer, who is running for reelection
against state Sen. Richard Ackerman (R-Irvine).</LD>
<TE>   In San Francisco County Superior Court, Lockyer sued Williams
Energy Marketing &amp; Trading Co., Mirant Corp., Coral Power and Powerex
Corp., the marketing arm of British Columbia's provincial utility.
Similar suits against other companies are "in the pipeline," Lockyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general alleged that hundreds of thousands of
electricity sales to California by these companies exceeded a fair
price. To determine what a fair price would have been, state
attorneys used a federal formula that takes into account the cost of
natural gas, the efficiency of a company's power plants and other
factors.</TE>
<TE>   Each incident of price gouging is subject to a $2,500 penalty
under a California business code that forbids unfair competition,
Lockyer said. The alleged penalties could amount to half a billion
dollars or more for each company, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general also alleges that the companies' electricity
sales in California are illegal because they failed to properly
submit quarterly sales reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. Such reports are supposed to detail the range of prices a
company intends to charge for power.</TE>
<TE>   Energy industry officials called Lockyer's action "a legal
stretch" and said the lawsuits are based on a failure to understand
how energy markets work.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all in response to the fact that the market got highly
volatile," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the
Independent Energy Producers, a lobbying group for electricity
sellers in California.</TE>
<TE>   He said no company submits quarterly reports to FERC in the manner
Lockyer suggests must be done. To do so would be impractical, said
Smutny-Jones, who compared it to asking Boeing Co. to predict what
its stock price will be three months ahead of time.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a year of investigating possible wrongdoing in
California's electricity market, state attorneys have burst forth
with a flurry of filings.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuits Lockyer announced Tuesday parallel a petition he
filed last month at FERC seeking nearly $3 billion from energy
companies. The petition alleges that the companies' power sales were
illegal because they failed to give regulators enough information to
determine if their prices were just and reasonable.</TE>

<HD>Plan to Close 5 Private Prisons Advances</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- Lawmakers gave initial approval Tuesday to Gov. Gray
Davis' plan to shut five prisons housing about 1,400 low-risk
inmates, but administration officials insisted that California's
influential prison guards union, a major donor to the governor, had
no sway over the proposal.</LD>
<LD>   The Assembly budget subcommittee vote was unanimous and came as
supporters of the private prisons--including some former inmates and
some residents of the small towns where the facilities are
located--packed the Capitol hearing room. Some charged that the
California Correctional Peace Officers Assn., long a foe of the
nonunion private facilities, influenced the decision.</LD>
<LD>   Department of Corrections Director Edward S. Alameida denied that.
Alameida said the proposal "has nothing to do with the union."</LD>
<TE>   The state Senate is to take up the proposal later this month.</TE>

<HD>Man Is Arrested in Syringe Attacks</HD>
<DH>Assaults: University student is held after three women
report being injected with a tranquilizing drug.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Authorities have arrested a 21-year-old UC San Diego psychology
student after a bizarre series of attacks on women that involved
injecting them with a tranquilizing drug.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Butcher was arrested over the weekend, said Santa Barbara
County Sheriff's Lt. Bill Byrne. Butcher's father, Southern
California businessman Andrew Butcher, posted $250,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   Three women, two in Santa Barbara and one on the ski slopes at
Mammoth Lakes, reported being attacked by a man with a syringe
between Jan. 11 and Friday, Byrne said.</LD>
<TE>   The women said they resisted but were unable to prevent their
attacker from injecting them with a drug that caused dizziness and
disorientation. One woman passed out and nearly died, the lieutenant
said.</TE>
<TE>   None of the women was sexually assaulted. "This is baffling,"
Byrne said. "This guy obviously gets feelings of power and control
out of this."</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Podberesky, a Santa Monica attorney representing Butcher,
said her client had nothing to do with the assaults. "He vehemently
denies all the allegations," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Butcher was nowhere near Santa Barbara, where he grew up, at the
time of those assaults, said Podberesky. He was at Mammoth when that
attack occurred, but was not involved, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The first attack took place at East Beach in Santa Barbara, when a
woman was stabbed in the buttocks as she bent over to pick up her
watch.</TE>
<TE>   Nine days later, on Jan. 20, a 20-year-old woman skiing at Mammoth
was reportedly tackled by a snowboarder, who held her down and
injected her. By the time paramedics arrived, she had stopped
breathing. She has since recovered.</TE>
<TE>   The last attack occurred Friday morning, when a jogger near the
Sandpiper golf course in Goleta was tackled and injected.</TE>
<TE>   Byrne said words were exchanged in the assaults but declined to
say what they were. He said all the women fought but quickly became
disoriented. Byrne declined to specify what drug was used, beyond
saying it had a tranquilizing effect.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in law enforcement a long time and seen a lot of
bizarre behavior," he said. "Can you imagine how frightening this
would be? These women had no idea what he was injecting."</TE>
<TE>   Byrne said there was no indication the attacker was intending to
render the victims helpless so he could kidnap them. He said the
attacker, or attackers, stayed around afterward long enough to see
the effect the drugs had on the women.</TE>

<HD>Plan for Drug Tests Dropped</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weighing fears of a drug epidemic against civil liberties, school
district trustees in Modoc County abandoned the idea Tuesday of
requiring annual drug tests of all high school students.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, the Modoc Joint Unified School District board will renew
efforts to train teachers to spot teens on narcotics and bolster the
high school's anti-drug education program.</LD>
<LD>   The board also signaled during its 4-0 vote that it has no
intention of revisiting the issue, even after the U.S. Supreme Court
rules later this year on an Oklahoma case that could allow tougher
tests on the nation's high school campuses.</LD>
<TE>   "They were unanimous in not wanting to give the policy further
consideration," said Kevin Jolly, the district superintendent. "They
want to support the kids instead with good activities and encourage
them to be drug-free."</TE>
<TE>   The testing plan had squarely divided folks in Alturas, the seat
of this rural county in California's northeast corner and home to
Modoc High's 300 students.</TE>
<TE>   During an initial hearing on the idea several weeks ago,
supporters of blanket drug testing turned out in force, voicing
concerns that the high school was plagued by abuse. But at a second
hearing, opponents decried the proposal as an over-the-top tactic.
Students, meanwhile, called it an overreaction that proved parents
lacked trust.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night's hearing, attended by 50 people, also was dominated
by concerns about the costs, accuracy and attitude of distrust that
testing would project to students.</TE>
<TE>   Missing from the hearing was Seab McDonald, the no-nonsense board
chairman who had championed broad drug tests of all high school
pupils. McDonald was out of town attending to funeral arrangements
for his father, who died of a heart attack over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald first raised the idea at the behest of Angel Williams,
whose son--a starting point guard for the Modoc Braves basketball
squad--confessed he had been smoking marijuana for two years. The son
also admitted that many of his peers used drugs, prompting his mother
to phone McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Recent events buttressed their concern. During the past winter,
several Modoc High wrestling and basketball team members were caught
using or selling drugs. Last month, sheriff's deputies arrested three
students caught smoking pot outside of town.</TE>
<TE>   Experts, however, say drug use in the sparsely populated community
(Modoc County has 9,500 residents scattered across an area larger
than Los Angeles County) is typical of rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Drug testing has long been a controversial tactic in U.S. schools.
In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld drug tests for student
athletes in an Oregon case. Since 1998, 5% of schools have performed
such tests, and 2% conduct them on all students in after-school
activities.</TE>

<LD>A woman convicted of second-degree murder in the dog mauling death of
her neighbor has hired a new attorney and requested that her
sentencing be delayed.</LD>
<LD>   Appeals specialist Dennis Riordan filed a motion Monday to
represent Marjorie Knoller and asked Judge James Warren to postpone
her May 10 sentencing hearing. Riordan also wants the judge to extend
the deadline for requesting a new trial until June 8, so he can
review the case.</LD>
<LD>   A hearing was set for Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Knoller, 46, faces 15 years to life in prison in the death of
Diane Whipple, 33, who was fatally mauled Jan. 26, 2001, outside her
apartment. Knoller's husband, Robert Noel, 60, was found guilty of
manslaughter and having a mischievous dog that killed someone. He
faces up to four years in prison.</TE>

<LD>The 20-year-old man accused of plotting a mass murder-suicide at his
community college has asked for a trial by judge because his lawyers
fear that he could not get a fair hearing from a jury after
September's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Al DeGuzman's trial on more than 100 felony counts is set to begin
today. He could be sentenced to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities arrested DeGuzman in January 2001 after a photo lab
clerk processed pictures of him posing with guns and explosives.
Police searched DeGuzman's bedroom and said they found the arsenal
and detailed plans to unleash them on De Anza College in Cupertino
the next day.</LD>

<HD>San Diego Vows to Fight Panel's Sewage Decision</HD>
<DH>Environment: Officials say they'll oppose state Coastal
Commission action that could force the city to spend billions to
upgrade treatment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>City officials Tuesday vowed to fight a state Coastal Commission
action that they said could force the city to spend billions of
dollars to needlessly upgrade its sewage treatment plant.</LD>
<LD>   Meeting in Santa Barbara, the commission on Monday voted 6 to 1 to
deny San Diego's request to endorse the city's bid for an extension
of a waiver from the federal Clean Water Act.</LD>
<LD>   The waiver allows the city to avoid an expensive upgrade of its
Point Loma sewage treatment plant.</LD>
<TE>   Upgrading would reduce the amount of sewage that flows into the
ocean without receiving secondary treatment, which causes a more
thorough breakdown of solid waste.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego officials say that right now, the Point Loma plant and
two smaller plants effectively treat about 83% of the city's solid
waste. They argue that secondary treatment would only lead to a 5%
additional reduction.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be wasting billions of taxpayers' dollars if we upgraded
a sewage facility that does not need upgrading," said Mayor Dick
Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy and other officials cited the views of scientists from the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla who contend that
outflow from the Point Loma plant is not harming fish and other
aquatic life.</TE>
<TE>   "By ignoring the scientific community, the Coastal Commission
chose dirty politics over clean water," said San Diego Councilman
Byron Wear.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's unexpected action could foreshadow a similar
ruling for Orange County when its expected bid for a waiver renewal
comes before the commission, possibly early next year. Orange County
environmentalists immediately hailed the vote.</TE>
<TE>   "The Coastal Commission is the latest nail in the coffin of the
[Orange County] waiver," said environmental activist Jan Vandersloot.
"The momentum is moving forward for getting rid of the waiver and
going for more thorough treatment of waste water."</TE>
<TE>   Although the waivers are issued by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and the state's regional water boards, the Coastal
Commission must determine whether a waiver is consistent with the
California Coastal Act.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nation's 16,000 public sewer agencies, 36 have waivers that
allow them to dump sewage that does not receive secondary treatment.
The Orange County Sanitation District is the largest and San Diego is
the second-largest.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said San Diego officials are considering three responses:
an appeal to the federal government to overrule the Coastal
Commission, an effort to negotiate a compromise with the commission
or a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "Litigation is the last resort," Murphy said. He noted that when
the issue went to court in the 1990s, a federal judge agreed that the
city was not violating the Clean Water Act and deserved a waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Following the lead of the EPA, the staff of the Coastal Commission
had endorsed the city's bid for a renewal of its waiver. Staff
members "pretty much defer to what the EPA does and we rely on that a
lot, but we are not the policymakers," said commission Executive
Director Peter Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   Commission Chairwoman Sara Wan, an environmental activist from
Malibu, said she is dubious about assertions that waste from Point
Loma is not harmful.</TE>
<TE>   "If we've learned anything over the years--particularly in Orange
County--it's that this is a very complex situation," Wan said. "The
commission feels we need more information. Do we know there's a
problem? No, we don't. But we also don't know there isn't a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Even in rejecting the city's bid, the commission dangled the
possibility that it would change its mind if the city would increase
monitoring off the coast for possible harmful impacts and expand the
use of reclaimed water. The commission also wants the city to do more
to reduce the amount of solids being discharged by a waste pipe that
stretches 4.5 miles out to sea from the Point Loma plant.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy and other city officials said the plant discharges less
than 11,000 metric tons per year, which is below the 15,000 tons
permitted under a 1995 waiver. But Wan said the has not declined
since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She said the spirit of the Clean Water Act requires cities with
waivers to continually attempt to reduce emissions. Meeting the
commission's three criteria would be far cheaper than the billions of
dollars mentioned by Murphy, Wan said. "What we want is very doable,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Shirley Dettloff, a member of the Huntington Beach
City Council, said she is worried about the ramifications of
continuing with waivers in the 21st century. "The time has come for
districts that have waivers to look at the overall goal of the
state," she said. "We've tried to strengthen our water quality
standards throughout the state."</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach is one of six cities and water districts to
formally oppose the renewal of the Orange County Sanitation
District's waiver.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's credit rating for bonds was upgraded a notch Tuesday,
indicating further financial recovery from the county's historic 1996
bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Standard &amp; Poor's upgraded the county's bonds from A to A+, the
fifth-highest municipal rating. The highest rating is AAA. Before the
bankruptcy, the county's bond rating had risen to AA-. It plunged to
as low as D after then-Treasurer Robert L. Citron's risky investments
resulted in a $1.67-billion loss to the county's government
investment pool.</LD>
<LD>   Current Treasurer John M.W. Moorlach said he was "pleasantly
surprised" by the upgrade, given the shaky financial condition of the
state budget. Moody's Investors Service, another national rating
agency, has all 58 California counties on credit watch, he said.</LD>

<LD>Representatives from the Orange County district attorney's office
testified Tuesday in favor of a proposed law that would allow prison
officials to use "reasonable force" to obtain DNA samples from
inmates.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which will come up for a vote by a legislative committee
later this month, is backed by law enforcement but opposed by
prisoners' rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union.</LD>
<LD>   A law approved several years ago requires prisoners convicted of
certain crimes to provide DNA samples. But many prisoners have
refused. Backers said the DNA sample could help connect prisoners to
unsolved crimes.</LD>

<LD>   The 1,400-square-foot branch of the county library is expected to
open in June in the city's community center. It will cost about
$250,000 a year to run.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike a traditional library, the branch will have about 25
computers and rely mostly on electronic data retrieval with a small

<HD>D.A. Adds Fraud to Meth Lab Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two years ago, authorities charged that baker Richard Martinez was
actually cooking up a batch of methamphetamine the day his mother's
restaurant exploded in flames.</LD>
<LD>   Now prosecutors accuse Martinez of illegally collecting more than
$500,000 in medical payments and workers' compensation as a result of
his burn injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez, who has denied any wrongdoing, suffered burns to more
than 60% of his body in the fire on March 4, 2000, which gutted his
mother's Zapopan Bakery in Santa Ana. Martinez told police he was
attempting to ignite a water heater's pilot light with a match and
newspapers when he suddenly heard a low rumble and was engulfed in
flames. However, investigators say the fire was started by a meth lab
Martinez operated in the bakery's attic.</LD>
<TE>   As Martinez awaited trial on the meth lab charge, Deputy Dist.
Atty. Vickie Bridgman said she learned that the defendant had
collected, and continues to collect, weekly workers' compensation
payments. Consequently, Bridgman said she charged Martinez with
workers' compensation fraud and grand theft.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, who could not be reached for comment, remains free on
$25,000 bond.</TE>

<HD>Council Orders Study at Bradley Landfill</HD>
<DH>Safety: Effect of radioactive waste dumped at Sun Valley
site will be examined.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council ordered a study Tuesday into whether
low-level radioactive waste was dumped at the Bradley Landfill and
whether it presents a health hazard, even as the dump operator
downplayed the problem.</LD>
<LD>   The council also separately agreed to launch a study of
alternatives to expanding the Sunshine Canyon Landfill into Granada
Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The Bradley Landfill issue stems from a report last week by the
state Integrated Waste Management Board that Rocketdyne's Santa
Susana Field Laboratory disposed of low-level radioactive waste in
the Sun Valley dump without the knowledge of state or local
regulators or the landfill operator.</LD>
<TE>   The material dumped at Bradley during the last decade was mostly
concrete, dirt, asphalt and other demolition debris. It was checked
separately for radiation by Rocketdyne, Oakridge Institute of Science
and Education, the state Health Services Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency, said Doug Corcoran, district manager
for Waste Management Inc., which runs the landfill.</TE>
<TE>   "Each one of those checks confirmed that the materials could be
released for unrestricted use," Corcoran told the council.</TE>
<TE>   City inspectors went to the landfill Monday and determined that
measuring devices aimed at keeping radioactive waste out of the dump
were working. "We found no violations of any permit requirements,"
said Gary Gero, assistant general manager of the city Department of
Environmental Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The council also asked the city Sanitation Bureau to study
expansion alternatives for Sunshine Canyon, including a plan to send
the waste by rail to landfills in remote desert areas. The report is
to be completed within 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Hal Bernson sought the study after the city rejected an
incomplete application by Browning Ferris Industries for an operating
permit at the expanded landfill.</TE>
<TE>   "We are happy [the city is] doing this study, because it's going
to show what previous studies have, that anything else is going to be
extremely more expensive and not as environmentally sound," said
Browning Ferris spokesman Arnie Berghoff.</TE>

<HD>Hacker Gets 16 Months for Crashing Firm's Computers</HD>
<DH>Crime: Lancaster man also must pay restitution for
accessing H.R. Textron's system after he was fired. He caused more
than $200,000 in damage, company says.</DH>

<LD>A disgruntled former employee was sentenced Tuesday to 16 months in
state prison and ordered to pay $50,000 in restitution for hacking
into a defense contractor's computer and crashing the system.</LD>
<LD>   Armen Oganesyan, 26, of Lancaster pleaded no contest to illegally
accessing H.R. Textron's computer system from a remote location and
causing more than $200,000 in damage.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Robert J. Schuit
recommended that Oganesyan, who has no prior convictions, be placed
in a local restitution center, where he may work while incarcerated
to repay his victim.</LD>
<TE>   "The community gets its punishment and the victim gets
restitution," the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   If accepted at the center, Oganesyan, a former systems
administrator, will work during the day and return to the center at
night.</TE>
<TE>   A third of his salary will go toward restitution, with the
remainder split between incarceration costs and the inmate.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, a month after being fired, Oganesyan tapped into
H.R. Textron's computer and caused the system to crash for a day,
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jonathan Fairtlough.</TE>
<TE>   Seven hundred employees at company offices in Valencia, Pacoima
and Ohio were unable to use their computers, causing $211,000 in lost
labor costs, Fairtlough said.</TE>

<HD>Woman Pleads Guilty to Workers' Comp Fraud</HD>
<DH>Courts: The defendant, who was caught on video playing
softball, faces sentencing in May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 42-year-old Ventura woman has pleaded guilty to workers'
compensation insurance fraud after being videotaped playing softball
and using a slide at a water park.</LD>
<LD>   Darlene Berdeaux, a former waitress at Seaside Park, is scheduled
to be sentenced May 6.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview Tuesday, she said she pleaded guilty because she
was hampered by financial problems.</LD>
<TE>   "My hands are tied," said Berdeaux, who received $10,563 in
disability payments and took private-investigator training classes
valued at more than $12,000. "The people that know me know I'm not
guilty. People who abuse the system: I'm not one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Berdeaux's problems started in 1997 when her hand was burned on
the job. She received a Demerol shot in her right hip and complained
of severe pain there for more than two years, according to a
statement from the district attorney's office. As a result, she
received disability benefits and job training.</TE>
<TE>   However, investigators became suspicious when they received
videotapes of Berdeaux sliding into base at her daughter's softball
game and using a slide at the Hurricane Harbor water park.</TE>
<TE>   But she was only filling in on her daughter's team during a
scrimmage, Berdeaux said. And at Hurricane Harbor, the heat of the
day and the warm water were therapeutic aids for her bursitis, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the videos, two of her physicians told authorities
that they believed Berdeaux had lied to them about her pain,
according to a statement from the district attorney's office issued
after her plea Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The maximum penalty for workers' compensation insurance fraud is a
five-year prison term and a $50,000 fine.</TE>

<HD>Rancher Agrees to Settlement Over Pesticide Use Near 2
Ventura Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A citrus rancher sued by prosecutors for allegedly allowing pesticide
to drift onto an elementary school agreed Tuesday to refrain from
spraying near two east Ventura campuses while classes are in session
and pay $25,000 in penalties and restitution.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura rancher Daniel Campbell agreed to terms of the settlement,
which permanently puts in place a preliminary injunction issued in
the wake of a reported pesticide drift onto Mound Elementary School
in November 2000.</LD>
<LD>   As part of the court order, expected to be completed today by
Superior Court Judge David Long, Campbell will be barred until 6 p.m.
on school days from spraying within 200 feet of the street that
borders Mound and Balboa Middle School.</LD>
<TE>   Campbell also agreed to notify school officials at least 72 hours
before any scheduled pesticide application on days classes are in
session, and to allow regulators from the Ventura County agricultural
commissioner's office to monitor any pesticide application that
occurs near the two schools.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell can farm without any of those restrictions after 6 p.m.
and on days when there is no school.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pleased with the outcome," said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty.
Greg Brose, who supervises the district attorney's consumer and
environmental protection unit.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it allows Mr. Campbell to do the farming on his
property he is entitled to do," he said. "And it will allow the
school to function in a way that doesn't impair kids, teachers or
parents."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors sued Campbell and his foreman, Raul Adame, last May
for allegedly violating state health and business codes.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit stemmed from the two reported drifts of the pesticide
Lorsban onto the Mound Elementary School campus, across the street
from Campbell's 200-acre lemon orchard. On one of those occasions,
two students were sent home and dozens of others complained of
dizziness and nausea.</TE>
<TE>   After filing the civil complaint against Campbell, prosecutors in
June obtained a preliminary injunction barring him from spraying on
the portion of his orchard closest to Mound when students were on
campus. It was the first court-ordered limit on use of a legal
pesticide in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Reached Tuesday, Campbell had no comment on the settlement. His
attorney, Archie Clarizio, could not be reached for comment but has
said the pesticide drift was caused by an employee--later fired by
the rancher--who sprayed in an area he was told to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, Campbell agreed to pay $25,000 in
penalties and restitution to several agencies, including $5,000 to
reimburse the Ventura Unified School District for costs associated
with the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the importance [of this case] is that it emphasizes the
concern we have for the safety of our students," said Don Austin, the
school district's lawyer.</TE>

<HD>Woman Arrested in Threats to Judge</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: The former dental assistant allegedly said she
would harm his family and bomb courthouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Redondo Beach woman was arrested Tuesday on federal charges of
sending menacing letters to a Los Angeles County Superior Court
judge, including one that threatened to bomb his courthouse and
another warning that his daughter and grandson would be "hung or
dragged from a truck" by white supremacists.</LD>
<LD>   Mimi Villegas Galdi, 35, a former dental assistant, was taken into
custody by FBI agents at her home without incident.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the alleged threats were directed at Judge William Beverly
Jr., who is assigned to the court's appellate division in downtown
Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said Beverly had dismissed Galdi's complaint against a
court commissioner in Torrance who had previously enjoined her from
contacting former co-workers at a dental clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Her former colleagues at the Megdal clinic in Lawndale sought the
injunction as a result of personal disagreements with Galdi, said
Assistant U.S. Atty. Becky Walker.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said Galdi sent numerous letters to Beverly about
her case. The first mention of violence came in a letter dated Aug.
25, 1998, in which Galdi threatened to "go on a shooting spree,"
according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's investigator talked to her and the letters stopped,
but they resumed this year, Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 27, the indictment charged, Galdi sent the judge a letter
threatening to bomb the courthouse and her former employer's
building.</TE>
<TE>   In a March 25 letter, Galdi again threatened to bomb Beverly's
courthouse and also threatened violence against his daughter and
grandson, the indictment alleged. Galdi is being held at the
Metropolitan Detention Center pending a bond hearing today.</TE>

<HD>Board Blamed for Turf Battles</HD>
<DH>Mental health: Supervisors are criticized by an advisory
panel's former leader for failing to stop department infighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former chairman of Ventura County's Mental Health Advisory Board
chided the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday for failing to stop turf
wars that have wreaked havoc in the Behavioral Health Department for
more than four years.</LD>
<LD>   John Chaudier, who served on the advisory panel for six years,
said he warned supervisors in 1999 that David Gudeman, a psychiatrist
with little administrative experience, was not qualified to run the
government agency, which has a $50-million annual budget.</LD>
<LD>   But supervisors, on a 3-2 vote, hired Gudeman, Chaudier said.
Supervisors said at the time that they had confidence Gudeman could
bring warring factions together and improve mental-health services.</LD>
<TE>   Continuing problems in the department show his warning was
correct, Chaudier told supervisors Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have not gotten better, ladies and gentlemen ..., " he
said. "We could almost sense what is happening today was going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that Gudeman finds reasons not to provide
mental-health services and feuds with other county agency heads over
which budget should be used to pay for treatment. The county this
week narrowly averted a legal showdown over Gudeman's initial refusal
to treat a teenager who needed psychiatric care.</TE>
<TE>   Judge John Dobroth said Monday he would hold off ordering the
services for two weeks because county officials have assured him the
youth would receive treatment and that broader changes in the
Behavioral Health Department are underway.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston is expected to make
recommendations April 16 to the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston has said he will look at everything from making
Behavioral Health separate from the larger Health Care Agency to
reviewing Gudeman's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Gudeman defends his tenure, saying he has managed to serve more
mentally ill clients with fewer dollars. The mental health chief said
he is drawing up new programs that will further expand services to

<LD>A prosecutor said Tuesday he is reviewing possible criminal charges
against the wife of Santa Paula's mayor, who has been under
investigation for allegedly issuing driver's licenses to illegal
immigrants.</LD>
<LD>   Rose Luna, who has worked at the local Department of Motor
Vehicles office for 25 years, allegedly helped obtain driver's
licenses for at least eight illegal immigrants without administering
proper driving tests in exchange for money, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. John Vanarelli said DMV
officials completed their investigation and turned their case over to
him late last week. A decision on whether to file charges may take
two weeks, he said.</LD>
<TE>   DMV officials have declined to comment on Luna's employment
status. Luna is the wife of Mayor Ray Luna. She has not been arrested

<DH>Mideast: A booby trap kills 13 Israeli soldiers. Scores of
Palestinians are also reported slain. Near Haifa, a suicide attack on a
bus kills at least 10.</DH>

<DL>JENIN, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>An explosion in a booby-trapped alleyway deep inside the besieged
Jenin refugee camp killed at least 13 Israeli soldiers Tuesday, while
uncounted dozens of Palestinians were also reported dead in the fiercest
fighting yet in Israel's 12-day-old West Bank offensive.</LD>
<LD>   And early today, a suicide bomber killed at least 10 Israelis on a
bus--the first suicide attack in more than a week.</LD>
<LD>   At the Jenin camp, plumes of smoke rose after the site was bombarded
by Israeli combat helicopters. Residents reported seeing bodies littering
the streets. Palestinian fighters vowed to resist to the death.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he would press ahead with
military raids and incursions across Palestinian territories despite
Tuesday's devastating blow. It was the army's single greatest
combat-related loss in five years. Seven soldiers were wounded in the
attack, and another soldier was killed and eight more wounded in a
separate attack a short time later.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is due in Israel on Thursday, a day
earlier than scheduled, to attempt to defuse the crisis. He said Tuesday
that the U.S. would be willing to contribute to an international
monitoring force if a cease-fire could be achieved.</TE>
<TE>   Powell also confirmed that he intended to meet with Yasser Arafat
despite Israel's attempts to isolate and ostracize the Palestinian
Authority president. Sharon labeled Powell's decision "a tragic mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Stoking fears of another war front, Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas
continued their attacks on northern Israel, firing missiles and Katyusha
rockets Tuesday and early today. Israel responded with overnight air
raids, striking suspected guerrilla hide-outs. There were no immediate
reports of casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Israel--under mounting international criticism--continued
attacking purported militant strongholds and hunting for suspects in the
West Bank cities of Ramallah, Bethlehem and Nablus. Israeli forces also
raided the West Bank town of Dura. Troops and tanks pulled back, however,
from two other cities, Tulkarm and Kalkilya.</TE>
<TE>   Israel says the campaign is aimed at uprooting suicide bombers and
other terrorists. Until today, there had been a lull of more than a week
in suicide bombing attacks.</TE>
<TE>   At the morning rush hour, a suicide bomber blew himself up on a
crowded bus near the coastal Israeli city of Haifa. At least 10 people
were killed and 20 wounded in the bus and in nearby cars, police said.
The death toll was expected to climb.</TE>
<TE>   The battle for Jenin inside the tight, cramped refugee camp was
shaping up as the toughest in the Israeli offensive. Jenin is also the
site of a looming humanitarian disaster, according to residents and
Palestinian relief workers. They said that Israeli armored bulldozers had
flattened dozens of homes, some with people still inside, and that
electricity and water had been cut for days.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Palestinians were reported dead or wounded, but an exact
count had not been made because ambulances had not been able to retrieve
all of the bodies.</TE>
<TE>   It was impossible to independently verify any claims because Israeli
authorities have banned journalists from entering Jenin--a decision that
fueled rumors of widespread calamity. On Tuesday, reporters were able to
reach the entrance to the town, about two miles from the refugee camp,
but were turned away by soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said the battle in Jenin was far from over.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to fight as long as necessary despite the loss,"
Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Eitan, chief of the Israeli army central command, said
in a briefing for reporters in Jerusalem on Tuesday night. "We will
continue until we make this camp submit."</TE>
<TE>   Eitan said the soldiers stumbled into the booby trap as they conducted
house-to-house searches.</TE>
<TE>   The men, all reservists, entered an alley in the refugee camp in
search of an explosives lab, Israeli officials said. Palestinian fighters
then detonated the explosives, bringing the building down on top of the
troops.</TE>
<TE>   A second unit of men arrived to attempt to rescue the first but came
under heavy gunfire, the Israeli army said. The 13 dead included three
whose bodies had to be dug out from the rubble. At least seven other
soldiers were hurt, one critically. A suicide bomber apparently joined in
the attack, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   "They walked into a trap," army spokesman Moshe Fogel said.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 23 soldiers have been killed in Jenin in less than a week
of fighting. The entire camp, Israeli army officers said, is like a
minefield of jury-rigged explosives and bombs meant to stop the advance
of invading Israeli forces.</TE>
<TE>   Most Israelis had predicted that the cramped maze of the old city of
Nablus would pose the most hazards for army units participating in the
West Bank offensive. But the camp in Jenin has offered more resistance.
Israeli newspapers were calling it the Palestinian Masada, after the
ancient Jewish fortress near the Dead Sea where tradition holds that a
band of Jews committed suicide in the 1st century rather than be captured
by Roman forces.</TE>
<TE>   Because Jenin, in the northernmost West Bank, is more distant from
densely populated parts of Israel than towns such as Tulkarm, it has been
a safer hiding place for the most hard-core militants. It is headquarters
to radical Islamic Jihad and Hamas factions and has produced the bulk of
recent suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's explosion marked the highest Israeli military death toll in
a single incident since a clash in September 1997 with Islamic guerrillas
of the Hezbollah movement in southern Lebanon, where 13 commandos were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Reservist Ron Drori, 30, of Jerusalem, who was injured in Tuesday's
attack, told Israeli television that the soldiers moved into the camp
Tuesday morning and did not meet resistance.</TE>
<TE>   "The commander checked if we could enter the three houses and take
them over, and decided that it was too dangerous," Drori said. "We went
into a narrow alley. Suddenly, a device exploded between the soldiers. .
. . I don't know where it came from. . . . Immediately, there was another
bomb. Almost immediately, they started firing on us from all directions."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government took great pains Tuesday to portray the
fighting in Jenin as a clash with armed Palestinians, not a frontal
assault on civilians.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no massacre there," said Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin.
"The 100 dead are armed men who were fighting to the death. Arabs fight
to the death."</TE>
<TE>   Reports from the camp, home to 15,000 refugees living on less than
half a square mile, told of civilians fleeing in panic, of heavy shelling
and homes in flames. The dead included civilians and fighters, residents
said. Contacted by telephone, some residents said they feared that the
end was near.</TE>
<TE>   "We are afraid now they will level the entire camp," said Jamal Shati,
a resident active in refugee issues.</TE>
<TE>   Fighters remained defiant.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal abu Hayjeh, a leader of Hamas, appeared on Arabic-language
television Tuesday afternoon and praised the "courageous fighters" of the
Jenin camp who had proved that they "can defeat the Zionist enemy."</TE>
<TE>   "We will fight until death or until we win," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The blast that killed the soldiers occurred about 7 a.m. and could be
heard more than a mile away. News of it was not released until the
evening, however, so that families could be notified first.</TE>
<TE>   Also by evening, clashes inside Jenin had reportedly resumed. Al
Jazeera, a Qatar-based satellite television station, quoted Palestinian
fighters in the camp as saying that Israeli armor and snipers were on the
attack, trying to corner the militants in a small area of the camp.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, the army was using bulldozers to flatten homes in the
camp's Al Hawashin neighborhood, apparently to make way for a tank
assault, Al Jazeera reported.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, in Burkin, a dusty village about a mile and a half south of
the camp where the recent fighting has cut electricity and forced the
village school and many businesses to close, Palestinians idled in the
streets, listening to transistor radios and exchanging rumors.</TE>
<TE>   The village is home to many camp residents who left before the
fighting or were expelled by the Israelis after it began. Telephone
contact between the village and the camp has dwindled in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   A 51-year-old metalworker who was arrested in the camp Sunday and
expelled Monday offered a fairly up-to-date but limited account of the
Israeli siege from the home of his in-laws in Burkin.</TE>
<TE>   The man, neatly dressed and with close-cropped gray hair, is a native
and lifelong resident of the camp. He declined to give his name for fear
of what might happen to his son and brother, who were still being held by
the Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The metalworker said the assault on the densely packed settlement
began about 3 a.m. Thursday and had been marked by daily barrages of
machine-gun and rocket fire.</TE>
<TE>   The assault was widely anticipated. The metalworker's wife, two of his
brothers and their families had moved away to the in-laws' home in
Burkin. The metalworker had remained in the camp with a younger brother,
their mother and one of his own eight children, a son.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday morning, he said, about 25 soldiers broke through the wall
of the family compound using jackhammers. They went first to the home of
the metalworker's brother, arrested him and interrogated him about a
drawing on his living room wall that seemed to resemble a map, he said.
The brother was severely beaten, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then the soldiers broke down the metalworker's front door and seized
him and his son, he said, leaving his mother behind.</TE>
<TE>   His brother was taken from the base in an ambulance to an unspecified
location, he said. When the metalworker was freed Monday, "they asked me
to go to any village but not back to the refugee camp."</TE>
<TE>   "I called someone I know in Israel to try to track my brother down,
but I cannot find him," he said. "I am afraid he is dead."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Press Bush to Stand Up for Israel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As President Bush comes under growing international pressure to
rein in Israel's military offensive against Palestinians, he faces
countervailing pressure from an overwhelmingly pro-Israeli Congress where
some members are pushing for new statements of support for the country.</LD>
<LD>   As lawmakers returned to work Tuesday after a recess that spanned two
weeks of rapidly escalating violence in the Middle East, Rep. Tom Lantos
(D-San Mateo) prepared to introduce a resolution expressing U.S.
"solidarity with Israel in its fight against terrorism."</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she would reintroduce
legislation to cut U.S. ties to the Palestinian Authority if Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell's mission in the region does not produce results.
"The U.S. should stand by Israel's side in the quest for peace and
security," Feinstein said in a floor speech.</LD>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney, meanwhile, traveled to Capitol Hill to
meet with Senate Republicans at a time when some conservatives have
questioned the Bush administration's willingness to continue negotiating
with Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Some congressional leaders are struggling to balance their desire to
show support for Israel against fears that legislative meddling could
upset diplomatic efforts to stabilize the region.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that some show of support for Israel is important and
critical," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). But he
added, "We need to decide what the correct and appropriate timing would
be."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the unflagging congressional support for Israel--even as
Israeli leaders have been slow to respond to Bush's personal pleas to end
the incursion into Palestinian-governed territory--is a strong reminder
of the tremendous influence wielded by the Jewish community and the
pro-Israeli lobby in U.S. politics.</TE>
<TE>   That power has its roots, in part, in sympathy for a democratic regime
with which the United States has deep cultural and religious ties. The
support base spans many faiths, notably evangelical Christian groups.</TE>
<TE>   But the clout also derives from a more direct, practical political
reality: The U.S. Jewish community, though only about 2.2% of the U.S.
population, is disproportionately represented in big states such as New
York, California, Florida and Illinois.</TE>
<TE>   Many Jews also have a track record as major political donors,
especially to Democrats. And Jews are well represented in Congress. There
are 10 Jewish members of the Senate, for instance, and no Arab Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "They are at the right places to have an impact on overall sentiment,"
said Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington-based political analyst.</TE>
<TE>   James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, argued that the
political power of the Jewish community is exaggerated. But he conceded
that what he terms the "myth" of Jewish clout has suppressed divisions in
Congress over Middle East policy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is reasoned discourse [over the Middle East] in almost every
sector of society except Congress," Zogby said.</TE>
<TE>   The bipartisan support for Israel was driven home last week when House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas)--viewed by many as the leader of the
GOP's conservative wing in Congress--gave a speech denouncing Arafat as
"completely untrustworthy." DeLay called on the Bush administration to
throw its weight behind Israel's campaign to "dismantle the Palestinian
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   With many members of Congress agreeing with that assessment, Cheney
sought to build support for Powell's mission by telling Senate
Republicans on Tuesday that Arafat was "the only one to negotiate with,"
according to a GOP source who attended the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   A draft of the resolution Lantos plans to push condemns Arafat harshly
and would put Congress on record as backing Israel "as it takes necessary
steps to provide security to its people by dismantling the terrorist
infrastructure in the Palestinian areas."</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers were concerned that such a measure would hurt U.S.
diplomatic efforts to bring Israelis and Palestinians back to the peace
table and to calm mounting Arab anger toward the United States over the
Middle East crisis.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said Tuesday that he did
not think it was appropriate for Congress to act while the situation is
in such flux.</TE>
<TE>   "The Congress of the United States ought to exercise a little bit of
self-restraint in the way we discuss this," Armey said. "The president is
responsible for foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   And Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), whose district includes a large
population of Arab Americans, expressed concern that the ability of U.S.
leaders to broker peace is hurt by the perception that Congress is
overwhelmingly allied with Israel. "How do you become an honest broker
when you give one side the feeling you're against them?" Dingell asked.</TE>
<TE>   But Feinstein, in her Senate speech, was unstinting in her criticism
of Arafat and her defense of Israel's right to defend itself--comparing
it to the U.S. military response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel must fight against this terror, just as we do," Feinstein
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), a staunch ally of Israel, questioned
Bush's decision to send Powell to the region before Israeli leaders had
accomplished their military aims.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been better if he waited a week and let Israel finish
the job," Schumer said.</TE>
<TE>   The escalating violence in the Middle East also has given some
Democrats an opening to criticize Bush on grounds on which he has been
untouchable of late: his conduct of foreign policy. Some of Bush's
critics argue that he was too slow to get personally involved in
peacemaking efforts and to send Powell to the region.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of us were calling for [the administration's] involvement much
earlier," Daschle said. "We felt that the administration was not as
engaged as they needed to be, and that has in part compounded our
difficulties" in the Middle East.</TE>

<HD>A Family Apart in Australia</HD>
<DH>The Bakhtiaris arrived as refugees at different times. One member
gained asylum, but others remain detainees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WOOMERA, Australia
</DL>
<LD>Roqia Bakhtiari tells her story this way. Before she left
Afghanistan, she had never set foot outside her village, never left her
home without covering herself in a burka, never handled money, never
learned to read and write.</LD>
<LD>   But after her husband, Ali Asqar Bakhtiari, escaped from a Taliban
army chain gang and fled the country, Roqia packed up their five children
and followed in hopes of finding freedom.</LD>
<LD>   She landed in Australia, where she and the children, now ages 5 to 14,
have been locked up in the country's most notorious detention center for
15 months.</LD>
<TE>   They came seeking sanctuary from persecution they feared in their
homeland. But here they encountered a tough policy unique among
Western-style democracies: All asylum seekers who arrive without proper
papers are incarcerated until their cases are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   The Australian government has held thousands of refugees in recent
years, but cases like that of the Bakhtiari family stand out.
Contradictory rulings by government authorities have kept the family
apart, allowing Ali to live freely in Sydney, for months unaware that his
wife and children were being kept here in the Woomera detention center.</TE>
<TE>   Australia usually grants asylum to an entire family if one member is
in jeopardy, but authorities say the Bakhtiaris received different
treatment because they arrived at different times. The case officer who
handled Ali's claim concluded that he is an Afghan refugee and granted
him asylum. The official who processed Roqia's application more than a
year later did not believe that she was Afghan and ordered her and the
children held for eventual deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing the family say the case is one of about 30 in
which wives and children are being held while the husbands and fathers
have received asylum.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said the government has no
intention of reuniting the families because they did not obtain
permission in advance to come to Australia. "You don't get a
family-reunion outcome if you come without authority," he said in an
interview. "That's the bottom line." On Tuesday, an attorney for the
Bakhtiaris said Ruddock had rejected a request that he release the family
on humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the Bakhtiari family bears the scars of its detention--and its
growing desperation. To protest their treatment, Roqia, 31, and her sons,
Alamdar, 14, and Montazar, 12, sewed their lips shut and went on a hunger
strike in January. Her brother, Mahzer Ali, who arrived with her and also
is detained, threw himself into a coil of razor wire at Woomera to call
attention to the family's plight. The gashes required 100 stitches.</TE>
<TE>   Roqia has come a long way from the sheltered life she says she once
led. She has shed her burka and any illusions she had about the West.</TE>
<TE>   "When I arrived, I felt I had finally reached a country that accepted
refugee people and I felt I had escaped from Taliban persecution and
atrocities," she said during a telephone interview from the detention
center, aided by a translator. "I didn't know that this country and these
people were worse than the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   Roqia said she grew up in the central Afghan village of Charkh in
Oruzgan province. When she was about 15, she married Ali Bakhtiari, a
cousin 11 years her senior.</TE>
<TE>   As she describes it, life in Charkh was simple. The villagers raised
livestock and grew alfalfa and vegetables. Barter was common; money was
not. Few followed the calendar, and birth dates went unrecorded. Women
were illiterate.</TE>
<TE>   Her world was dominated by men--her husband, father and
father-in-law--who managed all family affairs. After marriage, she began
covering herself in the head-to-toe burka whenever she went into the
village.</TE>
<TE>   The land was fertile and the family prosperous enough for Ali's
brother, Ghazanfar, to buy a truck. That was the Bakhtiaris' undoing.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Bakhtiaris are Shiite Muslims and members of the Hazara
ethnic minority, they have long been subject to discrimination at the
hands of Afghanistan's other ethnic groups and, most recently,
persecution by the ruling Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Ali said, Taliban members arrested Ghazanfar and forced him
to drive his truck for them. After eight months, he escaped and took his
family to Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban soldiers came looking for him. When they couldn't find
Ghazanfar, they took Ali. After beating and interrogating him over two
days, Ali said during a recent interview in the town of Woomera, they put
him in a labor camp, where he was forced to build houses for the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Now Ali, his face lined with worry, looks older than his 42 years. He
is quiet and seldom smiles. Despite his time in Australia, his English is
limited.</TE>
<TE>   Ali said he escaped from the camp after three months, returned home
briefly and fled to Pakistan. Three months later, Roqia said, the family
sold its possessions and, with other relatives, joined him in exile in
the neighboring country.</TE>
<TE>   Still fearful in a nation that was then sympathetic to the Taliban,
Ali made arrangements with a smuggler to leave Pakistan. He had only
enough money for himself.</TE>
<TE>   Using false documents, he boarded a plane thinking that he was going
to Germany. He arrived instead in Jakarta, Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   After days of traveling by bus and ferry and waiting in hotels and
homes, he and 140 other refugees reached southern Indonesia and boarded a
boat for Australia. They landed in December 1999, and Ali was sent to the
Port Hedland detention center in remote northwestern Australia.</TE>
<TE>   The camp is one of six set up to handle the flow of asylum seekers,
mainly from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, who have arrived by the thousands
in the last three years. Most fled to escape ethnic or religious
persecution and came to Australia in the hope of starting new lives in a
peaceful and prosperous country. Passage typically costs about $4,000 a
person.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddock, the immigration minister, said Australia must incarcerate all
refugees who arrive without permission to ensure that those denied asylum
are available for deportation.</TE>
<TE>   Some asylum seekers, including children, have been held more than two
years, unable to win asylum or go home. Even if ordered deported, they
can remain in custody indefinitely if their own country has no agreement
with Australia to take refugees back.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Prime Minister John Howard says stern measures are
necessary to prevent a flood of Central Asian and Middle Eastern refugees
from taking advantage of Australia's generous social system. His stance
helped him win reelection in November.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,700 asylum seekers are in custody, about 400 of them in
Woomera. Nearly all have been held since at least August, and some much
longer.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, monsoons have kept many refugees from attempting the
risky crossing from Indonesia. Australian warships patrol the region to
force back any refugee boats. Meanwhile, the government is planning two
new detention centers.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope that the lengthy detention and harsh conditions of the
camps will send the message that refugees are not welcome. The policy has
drawn criticism from human rights activists.</TE>
<TE>   "Punishing one person to deter another is immoral," said attorney Paul
Boylan, who is helping the Bakhtiari family and other Woomera detainees.
"To deter families by punishing children is even more heinous."</TE>
<TE>   Ali was held eight months before authorities verified his story and
granted him a three-year visa in August 2000, with the possibility of an
extension. Before he left Port Hedland, he said, he filled out a document
giving authorities the names of his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>She Thought They Were Sailing for Germany</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Roqia and the children were in Pakistan. They had not
heard from Ali and thought he was in Germany. Her father raised enough
money for their passage and asked the same smuggler to take Roqia, her
brother and the children to join Ali.</TE>
<TE>   They were flown to Indonesia and eventually boarded a boat with 240
others. Roqia thought she was sailing to Europe.</TE>
<TE>   As they headed toward Australia, their overcrowded boat began to leak.
The captain ordered passengers to throw extra clothing overboard to
lighten the load.</TE>
<TE>   Roqia reluctantly surrendered her burka, which she had worn throughout
the journey. It was not a moment of liberation. Even today she misses the
comfort of its anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I grew up, all the time I wore a burka," she recalled. "I
didn't meet strangers; I didn't meet men in other countries."</TE>
<TE>   She reached land on New Year's Day 2001, and an immigration officer
welcomed her to Australia--the first clue, she said, of where she was.
Convinced that Ali was in Germany, she feared that she would never see
him again.</TE>
<TE>   The refugees were flown to Woomera, the largest of the detention
centers, located on a former nuclear weapons and rocket test site in the
outback about 300 miles northwest of Adelaide. Double rows of razor wire
glisten in the desert sun. Summer temperatures reach 115 degrees. There
are no trees. Detainees call Woomera "a hellhole."</TE>
<TE>   They live in prefabricated housing, sleeping four to a small room or
in dormitories that can hold 18. Guards enter at any time.</TE>
<TE>   The housing compounds are known by names such as Oscar and Mike, but
the detainees are identified by the numbers they receive the day they
arrive. Roqia is No. 366. Her children are 367 through 371.</TE>
<TE>   The center is 100 miles from the nearest city, and visitors are few.
Since November, Ruddock's office has turned down repeated requests by The
Times to tour Woomera.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups have called for the center's closure. Detainees
complain of the harsh climate, inadequate schooling, and the quality of
food and medical care. But even worse, they say, is not knowing their
fate.</TE>
<TE>   Some become so depressed that they try to harm themselves by drinking
shampoo or detergent. Others attempt to hang themselves, set themselves
on fire or slash their wrists or necks. So far, no one has committed
suicide.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, hundreds of detainees broke through the fence, walked
into the town of Woomera and staged a peaceful protest. Subsequent
demonstrations turned violent as refugees set fire to buildings and threw
rocks at guards. Authorities used tear gas and water cannons to quell the
disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddock defends the pace for processing asylum applications. Refugees
often arrive without documents, making it difficult to verify their
stories. Many cases are decided by how credible the refugee seems during
the interview process.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Roqia arrived, she had her initial asylum interview. She
made a poor first impression.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't know the name of the currency used in Afghanistan or the
months of the Afghan calendar. She could not name the towns she passed
through on her route out of the country. She didn't recognize the sound
of the Pashto language, spoken in many parts of Afghanistan. Her accent
in her own Dari language struck officials as not quite right.</TE>
<TE>   She gave authorities her husband's name, but if they looked it up in
their records, they never let on.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, immigration officials concluded that she and the children
were not Afghans and rejected her claim for asylum. Officials suspected
that she was from Pakistan and deemed her ineligible for asylum because
there is no evidence she faces persecution there.</TE>
<TE>   Roqia appealed and did a better job of answering questions the second
time. That only made matters worse. Officials concluded that she had been
coached by other refugees.</TE>
<TE>   Genevieve Hamilton, who reviewed Roqia's case on appeal, could not
believe that she was so sheltered that she knew nothing of the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It is barely plausible that she had never handled money, and it is
not at all plausible that she had never seen it," Hamilton wrote in her
report. "Furthermore, even if she rarely went out of the house and did
not do the shopping herself, she could not have failed to be aware, by
the age of 31, what money was used in her claimed country of origin."</TE>
<TE>Tribunal Unaware of Decision for Husband</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton rejected the appeal in July. Apparently unaware that Ali had
been granted asylum a year earlier, and without meeting him, she wrote:
"The tribunal does not accept that the applicant's husband is an Afghan
national as there is no evidence supporting this claim."</TE>
<TE>   Nicholas Poynder, a Sydney attorney who recently began helping the
family, said Hamilton erred by measuring Afghan village life against
Australian standards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's imposing Western middle-class values to think that a woman would
know about money because all women go shopping," Poynder said. "The
tribunal has been proven 100% wrong, because her husband has been shown
to be Afghani."</TE>
<TE>   Roqia's brother, Mahzer, was evaluated by another case officer, who
determined that he was Afghan but concluded that he had lived in Pakistan
for at least two years and rejected his request.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why they decided that I am from Afghanistan and my
sister is not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Roqia, Mahzer and the children, held for deportation, became angry and
depressed. Roqia lost her timidity and became outspoken in criticizing
the Australian government.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the Taliban government, the Taliban would probably kill us
once," Roqia said. "But in this camp, they systematically torture us by
rejecting our case. They are systematically killing us."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Mann spent eight months teaching at Woomera and recalls that the
two Bakhtiari boys, Alamdar and Montazar, were good students at first.
But their interest in school deteriorated the longer they lived in
detention, he said, and they began running wild. The two older daughters,
Negineh, 11, and Samineh, 9, usually played in the dirt instead of coming
to class.</TE>
<TE>   "They would do well in any environment except Woomera, where they went
to pieces," said Mann, who is writing a book, "Behind the Razor Wire," on
his experience there. "The children don't deserve the punishment they
have had in these centers. Emotional abuse, that's what these children
are suffering."</TE>
<TE>   In August, an Afghan detainee who knew Roqia was released and arrived
in Sydney. He met Ali in the close-knit refugee community, recognized his
name and sent word to Roqia.</TE>
<TE>   "When I found out that my husband was living in Australia, I
straightaway told the authorities," Roqia said. "I told them that I found
my husband, but nobody was listening."</TE>
<TE>   Ali, who had found work in a slaughterhouse, could not afford to visit
his family, but he and Roqia began talking once a month by phone.</TE>
<TE>   In October, a legal aid attorney filed the appeal to Ruddock seeking
the family's release on humanitarian grounds.</TE>
<TE>   By January, the processing of asylum applications had slowed even more
as the government contemplated whether the fall of the Taliban meant that
Afghan refugees could go home. Most of the refugees, especially members
of the Hazara minority, feared that they would still face persecution.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 Afghan detainees at Woomera went on a hunger strike.
Roqia and the boys stitched their lips shut with thread. Alamdar said he
put three stitches in his lips, which soon became infected. Guards took
him to the medical center and forcibly removed the thread, but he later
sewed his lips shut again.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exactly like a prison," the 14-year-old said in a telephone
interview. "It's impossible to live in this camp. I invite you to come
and have a look for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Mahzer took the hunger strike a step further. On Australia Day, a
holiday similar to the Fourth of July, he climbed atop a building where
other detainees were protesting their treatment. Two held a sign that
read, "Freedom or Death."</TE>
<TE>   Mahzer, who had not eaten for 12 days, leaped into a coil of razor
wire. One blade nearly sliced his jugular.</TE>
<TE>   In Sydney, Poynder and his wife, Sharmini, read about the family in
the Sun-Herald newspaper. The next day, they raised enough money to send
Ali for a visit.</TE>
<TE>   On March 9, Ali saw his family for the first time in more than two
years. Roqia and the older children wept with joy, though 5-year-old
Ameneh didn't recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw my husband, I was so happy I thought I was reborn in this
world again," Roqia said.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview the day after the reunion, Ali said he did not see why
the government was detaining his wife and children.</TE>
<TE>   "If a baby bird falls from the nest and someone sees it, they would
put it back in the nest," he said. "I don't understand why they are not
doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allowed the family extended afternoon visits for the week
but assigned the couple to a room where they could easily be observed.</TE>
<TE>   Ali has since returned to Sydney, where he awaits a decision on his
family's future and hopes for another chance to visit.</TE>
<TE>   Ruddock spokesman Steve Ingram suggested that the department's mistake
was accepting Ali as an Afghan, not denying asylum to his family. Now
that the Bakhtiaris have come to the department's attention, he said, it
may reconsider Ali's visa.</TE>
<TE>   "He came some time ago prior to the detailed level of checking that we
are now capable of doing," Ingram said. "We are looking at a number of
decisions that were taken in the past where people were granted visas."</TE>
<TE>   On March 28, a Geneva-based United Nations human rights panel agreed
to examine the family's case. The committee's findings will not be
binding, but it recommended that Australia not deport Roqia and the
children until the panel has weighed in.</TE>
<TE>   On Good Friday, Woomera detainees aided by hundreds of protesters
outside knocked down a fence and 50 refugees escaped. Most were quickly
arrested, but more than a dozen remain at large. At least two of the
Bakhtiari children left the center during the chaos but returned on their
own.</TE>
<TE>   The brief taste of liberty was hardly enough. The Bakhtiaris face
months more waiting at Woomera. On Tuesday, Poynder said Ruddock notified
Roqia that he had denied her humanitarian appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "I have personally considered your case, and I have decided that it
would not be in the public interest to intervene," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Australia cannot logically deport them to Afghanistan, since
it denies that they are Afghans. And Pakistan is unlikely to take them if
their nationality is in doubt.</TE>
<TE>   "Day and night, my children think about freedom," Roqia said. "Their
father was freed from detention, and they also want their freedom."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Lawyer Accused of Aiding Imprisoned Cleric in Terror Plot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A defense lawyer and three others were indicted Tuesday for
allegedly enabling a blind Egyptian cleric to run a violent Al
Qaeda-affiliated terrorist organization from his U.S. prison cell by
helping him communicate with his followers around the world.</LD>
<LD>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said that attorney Lynne F. Stewart conspired
to help her longtime client, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, maintain his
influence over the Islamic Group even though he has been in virtual
lock-down since 1995, when he was convicted of seditious conspiracy in
plotting to destroy New York City landmarks.</LD>
<LD>   Abdel Rahman has most recently been housed in a maximum-security
medical prison in Minnesota. He is not allowed to communicate with his
followers, the media or anyone except his lawyer because of authorities'
concerns that he may be conspiring in efforts to commit more acts of
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Stewart, 62, has represented a series of Islamic militants, accused
cop killers and Mafioso-turned-informant Salvatore "Sammy the Bull"
Gravano. Earlier this year, she announced that she would represent Abdel
Rahman's son Ahmed, who was captured in Afghanistan in November and
accused of being a liaison between the Islamic Group and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Also indicted were Arabic interpreter Mohammed Yousry, and Ahmed Abdel
Sattar and Yassir Al-Sirri, described in court papers as active members
of Islamic Group, or Gama'a al-Islamiyya. The organization has claimed
responsibility for the 1997 slaying of 58 tourists at an Egyptian
archeological site and other bloody terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Abdel Rahman relied on communications
with Stewart, translated by Yousry, to pass messages to and receive
messages from Sattar, Al-Sirri and other Islamic Group members, including
discussions of potential terrorist activities in Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   Although Abdel Rahman, 63, was not charged on Tuesday--he is serving a
term of life in prison without parole--Ashcroft accused the religious
leader of adhering to the principles of Al Qaeda, an affiliated terrorist
organization run by one of the sheik's most vocal supporters, Osama bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda's official training manual, Ashcroft said, states that
imprisoned Islamic jihadists, or holy warriors, should continue their
terrorist operations by surreptitiously exchanging information with those
on the outside and even getting coded directives out to them.</TE>
<TE>   "As today's indictment sets forth, Sheik Abdel Rahman has learned Al
Qaeda's lessons well," Ashcroft said. "Sheik Rahman is determined to
exploit the rights guaranteed him under the United States' system of
justice to pursue the destruction of that very system. The United States
cannot, and will not, stand by and allow this to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Abdel Rahman could not have maintained his leadership role in the
Islamic Group, Ashcroft said, without the "willful and repeated
assistance" of Stewart and the three others indicted. He described Sattar
and Al-Sirri as vital links between the blind sheik and his fervent
followers worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents arrested Stewart, Yousry and Sattar on Tuesday, searched
their homes and offices and seized computers and other records. Al-Sirri,
the head of the London-based Islamic Observation Center, has been in
custody there since his arrest on terrorism charges in October 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, Stewart was arraigned at a hearing in federal court in
Manhattan that was attended by more than 40 supporters, many of them
defense lawyers who said they were irate that their legal colleague had
been arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was asked by U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl how she would
plead.</TE>
<TE>   "Emphatically not guilty," Stewart said. She was released on $500,000
bond. Yousry and Sattar also pleaded not guilty; Yousry made $750,000
bond but Sattar was denied bail.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the courthouse, Stewart said to reporters, "Are they going to
arrest the lady who cleans the sheik's cell? It goes too far." The other
defendants could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart faces a maximum of 40 years in prison if convicted on all
counts with the sentences served sequentially; the others could receive
between 35 and 55 years. All were charged with conspiracy to provide
material support and resources to a terrorist organization; other charges
filed against various defendants included conspiracy to defraud,
solicitation and making false statements.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion in May 2000, the indictment alleges, Stewart visited
Abdel Rahman at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., and
discussed with him whether the Islamic Group should continue to comply
with a 2-year-old cease-fire agreement with Egyptian authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Following that meeting, Stewart told the media that Abdel Rahman had
withdrawn his support for the cease-fire, in effect communicating his
wishes to his followers, according to the indictment.</TE>
<TE>   On another occasion, Stewart and the others agreed to rile up Abdel
Rahman's followers by saying he was being denied much-needed insulin for
his diabetes, when they knew he was receiving the medication but refusing
to take it, the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Goodman, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights,
a New York-based human rights organization, said outside the hearing that
he believed it was the first time a lawyer had been indicted in
connection with a terrorism case, and certainly the first since the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "People are shocked more than outraged; outrage will come later,"
Goodman said. "This is a long, slow progressive buildup of the assault on
the Bill of Rights. This is an attack on the bar."</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft said Stewart had turned the corner from aggressive legal
advocate to willing and knowing participant in illegal acts by serving as
an information conduit in direct defiance of a judge's order.</TE>
<TE>   At his news conference, Ashcroft did not elaborate on what, if any,
alleged plots were believed to be in the works by Islamic Group, citing
an ongoing criminal probe. But he said the group was clearly a threat.</TE>
<TE>   "Islamic Group is a global terrorist organization that has forged
alliances with other terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda," Ashcroft said
at a news conference near the wreckage of the World Trade Center. "It has
an active membership in the United States, concentrated in the New York
City metropolitan area."</TE>
<TE>   The group and the sheik are such a threat that authorities have been
engaged in court-authorized monitoring of his conversations since 1998,
Ashcroft said. The indictment grew out of these monitored conversations,
and other evidence that officials did not disclose.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns that the Egyptian spiritual leader may have been involved in
terrorist plots was also a prime motivator for the Justice Department's
move to monitor the prison conversations of more than a dozen other
imprisoned militants suspected of fomenting terrorism in the aftermath of
the Sept. 11 attacks, Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was Abdel Rahman's lawyer when he was convicted in 1995 for
his role in a conspiracy to blow up several tunnels, the United Nations
building, the George Washington Bridge and other New York landmarks. He
was regarded as the spiritual leader of the group involved in the 1993
World Trade Center bombing, which killed six and injured more than 1,000
people.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Srebnick, a Miami defense attorney who represented two lawyers
indicted for helping their drug-dealer clients, said Stewart's case
raises interesting issues. He said the facts of the case ultimately will
determine whether Stewart broke the law or was merely being an aggressive
defender of her clients.</TE>
<TE>   "It is always appropriate for a lawyer to zealously defend his client
within the bounds of the law, regardless of whether the lawyer believes
in the client's innocence or guilt," said Srebnick, who is also an
adjunct professor at the University of Miami on ethics and criminal law.
"But it is never appropriate for a lawyer to commit criminal acts to
further the client's illegal conspiracy. A lawyer routinely communicates
with his client and on behalf of his client, but cannot serve as a
messenger for the client knowing that the message is a criminal act."</TE>

<HD>Bush to Urge Senate to Ban All Cloning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush will intensify his push today for a comprehensive
ban on human cloning, raising the temperature in a debate that has been
smoldering at the crossroads of ethics and science.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech in the White House Rose Garden, Bush is expected to urge
the Senate to ban cloning as a potential method for creating children and
as a tool for research into cures for disease.</LD>
<LD>   But the approaching Senate debate is presenting him with a political
challenge even more complex than the emotional battle over stem cell
research that divided his administration last summer.</LD>
<TE>   Then, Bush fashioned a compromise on the sharply polarizing issue of
federal support for stem cell research. Although he failed to fully
satisfy either scientists who supported the research or religious
conservatives who opposed it, he found a middle ground that largely
defused the controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, both sides agree that there is no obvious compromise
available between those who want to ban all human cloning and those who
would permit cloning for medical research while barring it for
reproduction.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has sided squarely with advocates of the comprehensive ban. But
he has much less leverage than he did in the stem cell controversy to
steer the debate toward his desired outcome.</TE>
<TE>   In the stem cell decision, Bush used his executive powers to limit the
federal government's involvement in the controversial research. But a
cloning ban will require congressional action. And though the House has
passed the comprehensive ban that Bush and social conservative groups
favor, advocates of cloning in disease research--often called
"therapeutic" cloning--are cautiously optimistic that they have the votes
they need to block a total ban in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   That could produce a legislative deadlock and leave the United States
as one of the few Western nations without a ban on reproductive
cloning--an outcome hardly anyone on the political spectrum supports.</TE>
<TE>   "If in fact nothing happens, it leaves us in a difficult and very
unfortunate place," said one White House official who asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   There have been no credible claims that any scientist has produced a
cloned child, and the latest experiments suggest that such a feat could
be quite difficult. However, anxiety is rising that rogue scientists are
pushing ahead; last week, an Italian scientist issued an unverified claim
that he had successfully implanted a cloned embryo in a woman who is now
about two months' pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   The cloning debate hasn't yet attracted as much attention as last
year's struggle over stem cell research. But activity on both sides is
notably escalating as the Senate moves closer to a vote--expected
sometime before the Memorial Day recess--on the emotional issue.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, the House voted by a 265-162 margin to ban human cloning
for all purposes. In the Senate, Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.), a leading
social conservative, has introduced similar legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Brownback's proposal has emerged as a top priority for social
conservatives and antiabortion groups. "This is huge. This is our biggest
issue this year," said Connie Mackey, vice president for government
affairs at the Family Research Council.</TE>
<TE>Fears of People as 'Manufactured Artifacts'</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a coalition of environmental, feminist and other liberal
leaders joined the conservatives in urging a ban on reproductive cloning
and a moratorium on research cloning. "These conditions leave us
vulnerable to being pushed into a new era of eugenic engineering, one in
which people quite literally become manufactured artifacts," the group
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The biotechnology industry, patients' advocates and scientific groups
are rallying behind a pair of competing Senate proposals, one from Edward
M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the other from Tom
Harkin (D-Iowa) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.). Those bills, which are
expected to be merged as soon as this week, would ban cloning for
reproduction but permit it as part of research into cures for disease or
disability.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of research say cloning could hold the answer to tissue
rejection, a problem that causes many tissue and organ transplants to
fail.</TE>
<TE>   They envision taking a skin or cheek cell from a patient and using it,
through cloning, to create an embryo. Scientists would dissect the embryo
at about 5 days old for its stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, the stem cells could be grown into new cells for diabetics,
heart patients or others whose own cells and tissues have failed. These
replacement cells would have the same genetic makeup as the patient, so
they would not be rejected by the patient's body, advocates believe.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of American researchers already are pursuing such
experiments.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush adamantly rejects that vision and supports the comprehensive
ban that passed the House. "From the president's perspective, this is a
very cut-and-dried ethical question: You don't create life to destroy
life," said the White House official. "The president believes there
aren't different types of human cloning. You can call them reproductive
cloning or research cloning depending on what the ultimate goal is, but
they are still human cloning."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the comprehensive ban see some signs of momentum. Last
Wednesday, Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), a leading Senate voice on health
issues and the chamber's only physician, came out in support of the
outright ban.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative strategist William Kristol, the founder of an
anti-cloning group, says supporters of the comprehensive ban are
increasingly optimistic they can win a Senate vote--unless opponents
filibuster. "Unless [Senate Majority Leader Tom] Daschle requires a
60-vote majority, which I doubt he will, I think the momentum is in our
direction."</TE>
<TE>Push for Full Ban May Mean No Ban</TE>
<TE>   But supporters of cloning for research purposes remain confident their
Senate allies will filibuster if necessary to block a ban--which could
mean that no bill clears the Senate, and no cloning procedure is banned.</TE>
<TE>   "If they want to pass a prohibition on reproductive cloning, that can
be done tomorrow," said Sean Tipton, director of public affairs for the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine. "Those who insist on banning
any use of the technology are only going to succeed in ensuring that
there is no ban on reproductive cloning--no bill at all."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of therapeutic cloning also have reason to hope that Sen.
Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a strong opponent of abortion, will favor
therapeutic cloning, bringing other conservative Republicans with him.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress fails to ban human cloning, existing rules would still bar
scientists from using federal funds to either produce or destroy cloned
embryos. But the limits on privately funded research would be unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration has said that anyone attempting to
produce a child through cloning would need agency approval. But many
lawmakers doubt the agency has such authority--which might leave the door
open to privately funded attempts at human cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even though both sides want to prevent that possibility, it is not
clear they can find a way to avoid it.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the White House, and outside groups opposing cloning,
say they would prefer no bill rather than one that banned only cloning
for reproductive purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Their argument is that permitting cloning for research, while banning
it for reproduction, would require scientists to eventually destroy every
embryo they create--a prospect they view as morally unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   "No legislation obviously creates a problem for people who want to ban
reproductive cloning," said the White House official. "But a partial ban
is wholly unacceptable to people who don't see a difference between
reproductive or research cloning. Indeed, a partial ban would make it a
crime not to destroy cloned embryos once they are created."</TE>

<LD>Nothing about Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks ever
suggested he would accept the Police Commission ouster and simply walk
away. He is, in a word, headstrong--and always has been.</LD>
<LD>   He is so single-minded he used to study for advancement tests by
holing up in vacant apartments. He once used a camper shell parked
outside his home, reading by flashlight.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like he was in prison," his wife, Bobbie, later recalled.</LD>
<TE>   So on Tuesday, when commissioners voted to end his five-year tenure as
police chief, Parks responded in character, vowing to fight the action to
the end. Next stop will be a hearing before the Los Angeles City Council.
Should he fail there, Parks promised to continue reporting for duty until
the very last day of his term--Aug. 12.</TE>
<TE>   "I have only one plan at this time," Parks said, moments after
Tuesday's 4-1 vote. "And that is to get reappointed as chief of police of
the city of Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Parks faced reporters with his head high, his voice eloquent and
clear, showing the apparent pride and resolve of a man who has built his
life--and his career--around those two very traits.</TE>
<TE>   He also demonstrated the rigidness that critics have cited as a major
cause of his downfall. Doggedly defending his track record, lashing out
at commissioners and others for "politicizing" the selection process, he
painted himself as a reformer and man of principle who simply ran out of
time in trying to bring the massive Los Angeles Police Department into
line.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, he acknowledged the strain of the
afternoon's events. Asked whether the day had been difficult, Parks said:
"They are all difficult, but this is one of the more difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Of the police morale problems cited by commissioners as a reason for
denying him another term, Parks said: "It is not the job of the chief of
police [to look after] everyone's individual morale. They have some
responsibility to this community . . . to have a mind-set of service."</TE>
<TE>   Of his reputation for inflexibility, Parks said: "I am inflexible
about corrupt officers, about officers who do not tell the truth, about
officers who do not treat the public correctly."</TE>
<TE>   And of the recent upsurge in violent crime also cited by
commissioners, Parks invited an inspection of crime trends in the last 30
years--or even the last five.</TE>
<TE>   "You will find a remarkable reduction in crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Parks achieved his goal of becoming the department's top officer
in 1997, the department was in a crisis. The police beating of Rodney
King and the subsequent acquittal of four LAPD officers in that case had
caused the riots of 1992 and resulted in public pressure on the
department to carry out reforms.</TE>
<TE>   A subsequent corruption scandal, centered on the Rampart Division, has
put former officers in jail for skimming drugs and money and planting
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' hard-line style in dealing with those issues has won him both
praise and condemnation. While he traveled to Washington to meet with top
Justice Department officials, he alienated some federal authorities who
perceived him as strongly resistant to reforms.</TE>
<TE>Some Officers See Him as 'Overzealous'</TE>
<TE>   His efforts to enforce internal discipline alienated his own officers,
who saw him as "overzealous," in the words of one veteran motorcycle
patrolman. Officers saw him as a man who would not listen to counsel from
the ranks, who would not back them in a pinch, who wanted to make such a
show of punishing wayward officers that no one was entirely safe in being
a good, tough street cop.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't possibly get any worse," the motorcycle officer said Tuesday
at the 77th Division station in South-Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-square-mile precinct has seen 37 murders this year in an
eruption of gang violence that threatens to set homicide records.</TE>
<TE>   Another policeman, a 28-year veteran who has spent most of his career
in the same precinct, remembers when Parks was a captain there. Despite
those ties, the officer was bitter and requested he not be quoted by
name.</TE>
<TE>   "When a manager says, verbatim, that morale is not a management
problem . . . what direction would you expect things to head?" he asked,
comparing the LAPD to Enron. "All the wishes of the officers are stifled.
You can only bang your head against a wall so many times."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to call Parks' removal "the first step to turn this
department around and make an attempt to give the citizens of Los Angeles
what they deserve."</TE>
<TE>   One of the constraints of Parks' command has been a broad blueprint
for reform negotiated between the Justice Department and the city of Los
Angeles. The consent decree, signed in 2000, laid out hundreds of
provisions for conducting internal audits and tracking problem officers
as a way to protect civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Parks initially opposed the decree, a point Mayor James K. Hahn has
frequently noted in his campaign against him. But Parks defended his
stance by saying the LAPD already was undertaking many of those
reforms--without being told.</TE>
<TE>Resentment Over Federal Consent Decree</TE>
<TE>   To Parks, the consent decree represented in large part the
appropriation of many of his own efforts, stemming from the department's
investigation of the Rampart scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Parks and his deputy chiefs were proud of what they felt were unique
efforts to rout out corruption and squarely face its own failings--only
to have others take the credit. Meanwhile, department brass were
dismissed for purportedly defending the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   In one sense, the debate over the consent decree was a crystallization
of the attributes that brought Parks success--and that cost him allies.</TE>
<TE>   He fought the decree in part because he deeply resented the notion
that federal law enforcement authorities--the people behind Waco and Ruby
Ridge, two tragedies associated with the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms--would tell him how to run a police department.</TE>
<TE>   So committed was Parks to fighting the imposition of the decree that
when his granddaughter was killed in Los Angeles while he was on vacation
on the East Coast, he did not return home immediately.</TE>
<TE>   First, he went to Washington to meet with Justice Department officials
regarding their demands for the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, his stubbornness prevented him from seeing a political
solution to the negotiations with the federal government. Even after
then-Mayor Richard Riordan had bowed to the inevitable and agreed to sign
the decree, Parks continued to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Up until the final minutes before the deal was struck, he lobbied for
changes, infuriating some federal officials and police reform advocates.</TE>
<TE>   Parks talks frequently about principles and says honesty is his
guiding ethos. That was a theme he hit hard in the days before the
commission vote, saying, "I would rather lose my job than not do what's
right for the right reasons."</TE>
<TE>   One telling moment for Parks came just before the commission retired
to closed session Tuesday to decide his fate.</TE>
<TE>   There was a relatively minor agenda item involving the future of the
DARE anti-drug education program. Commissioners discussed temporarily
scuttling the program so officers could be reassigned to patrol, easing
the manpower shortage on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   But Parks, even with his own ouster pending, showed no signs of
seeking to appease.</TE>
<TE>   DARE was the department's only prevention program, he argued.
Commission President Rick Caruso, sounding faintly exasperated, finally
agreed to defer the issue, after giving the chief a terse admonition: "I
suggest you get creative."</TE>
<TE>   Parks has compared the job of running the LAPD to "keeping 1,000
plates spinning at once."</TE>
<TE>   Following the commission's decision, he repeated his oft-expressed
feeling that the LAPD is misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe adequate attention was given to . . . the complexity
of what we deal with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the complexities are not understood, if we make simplistic
decisions, we will end up harming the city."</TE>

<HD>Police Commission Rejects Parks</HD>
<DH>LAPD: Chief's bid for a second term is denied on 4-1 vote. Wide
majority of City Council says that decision should stand.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Police Commission rejected Chief Bernard C. Parks'
bid for a second five-year term Tuesday, saying he had failed as a leader
and bore responsibility for a rising crime rate, a decline in officer
morale and a "profound crisis of confidence" in a department once
considered among the nation's best.</LD>
<LD>   The 4-1 vote by the commission came after lengthy deliberation and
appeared likely to end Parks' defiant struggle to stay in office despite
opposition from Mayor James K. Hahn, the police union and others.</LD>
<LD>   The City Council still could override the commission's decision, and
Parks pledged to "stay the course" and continue to fight for his job.
Only three of 15 council members, however, said they were inclined to
vote for retaining the chief, who would need a two-thirds majority to
overturn the commission vote.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters after the commission announced its vote, Parks,
58, said he was disappointed but "very, very proud of my service."</TE>
<TE>   "My record and my accomplishments offer a compelling support for my
reappointment," he added. "There is still much to be done,"</TE>
<TE>   The panel's decision was a victory for Hahn, whose public call for a
new chief was the most dramatic move of his young administration. But the
rejection of Parks could also cost Hahn long-term political support among
African Americans. Some black leaders said Tuesday they never again will
back Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the decision, Police Commission President Rick Caruso
acknowledged that it "may not be liked by all, but will hopefully be
accepted by the residents because it is arrived at by relying on facts,
on those things which can be measured, can be gauged, can be assessed and
weighed."</TE>
<TE>   Although he praised Parks, the city's second African American police
chief, for making the department more diverse and for demanding
discipline of his officers, Caruso described the chief as an inflexible
and remote leader who had crippled officer morale. That, he said, had
driven police veterans from the department and put a severe crimp on
recruiting.</TE>
<TE>   The department is now 1,100 officers short, he said, and the shortfall
may have contributed to a sharp increase in violent crime in the first
three months of this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, the Los Angeles Police Department is in crisis, a department
losing officers at an alarming rate," Caruso said. "Trust and confidence
between those in uniform and their chief has been mortally wounded. This
department, similar to all organizations, needs a leader who is demanding
but fair, accepts responsibility and seeks solutions, who is capable of
energizing and motivating the men and women in the field."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with The Times, Caruso went further. He accused Parks
of being "less than forthcoming" with the commission and cited two
examples. Once, he said, Parks tried to circumvent a commission decision
to change police officer work schedules. More recently, he said, Parks
submitted to the commission a performance evaluation about himself that
members believed was misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Parks strongly denied having been untruthful.</TE>
<TE>   If the City Council does not override the commission's decision,
Caruso said, the board will probably begin a national search for a
successor for Parks. Caruso added, however, that he hopes a new chief
could be found within the LAPD's ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Several names of potential successors to Parks have already surfaced.
Among those considered possibilities are Portland, Ore., Police Chief
Mark Kroeker, a longtime LAPD commander, and Sacramento Chief Arturo
Venegas Jr. Both men were considered for the LAPD job in 1997, but were
beaten out by Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Within the 8,900-officer department, Deputy Chiefs David Gascon, David
Kalish and Scott LaChasse are considered potential candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn praised the commission for conducting "a full and fair process,"
but was careful not to express relief that the panel decided to follow
his advice.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a win for anyone," the mayor said during a news
conference in his office. "This is a decision that the Police Commission
had to make in the best interests of the department and the city.</TE>
<TE>   "They based their decision on the merits--not on politics, not on
pressure, not on intimidation, but on the facts that were before them,"
Hahn added.</TE>
<TE>   Parks became Los Angeles' 52nd police chief in 1997, immediately
following the troubled reign of Chief Willie L. Williams. Although Parks
was credited with carrying out significant reforms, his term was marred
by increasingly bitter clashes with the rank and file and by a scandal
surrounding alleged abuses by an anti-gang unit in the Rampart Division.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn announced in early February that he would not support Parks' bid
for a second term because he was unhappy with the chief's record on
crime, reform and community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said Tuesday that he was "very disappointed" that the mayor had
spoken out before the commission had determined the criteria by which he
would be judged.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the facts are crystal-clear," the chief said. "For the past
five years, I have worked tirelessly to fill the leadership voids and
correct the failings of the previous years. . . . While the commissioners
claim they avoided political rhetoric, I disagree. This process has
become much too politicized."</TE>
<TE>   Parks took issue with Caruso's claim that he had presided over a rise
in crime. If the commission had looked at statistics covering his full
tenure in office, he said, it would have found a "remarkable reduction."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's Uniform Crime Reports show that Los Angeles did enjoy a
dramatic decrease in violent crime during Parks' first three years as
chief. More recently, however, the rates of murder and robbery, the
most-watched categories of violent crime, have increased.</TE>
<TE>   From 1995 to 2000, the latest year for which statistics are available,
incidences of murder fell 40% in Los Angeles, second only to New York
among the nation's four largest cities.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1999 and 2000, however, murders jumped 28% in Los Angeles, a
sudden turnaround attributed by police and criminologists to the impact
of the Rampart scandal on gang suppression and the possibility that
criminals in Los Angeles have become better armed. Robberies increased 6%
in that year. During the same period in New York and Chicago, the drop in
murders and robberies continued, though at a much slower pace than
earlier in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   At 14.8 murders per 100,000, Los Angeles still had a much lower rate
in 2000 than Chicago and Philadelphia, both at 22. New York's murder rate
was 8.7.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's opposition to Parks upset many black community leaders who
had supported Hahn's election bid. Their sense of betrayal was reflected
in recent poll figures showing broad disapproval among black voters, who
had comprised a quarter of his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   The lone black member of the Police Commission was the only
commissioner to vote in favor of a second term for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my opinion that Chief Parks has a wealth of knowledge and
skills that can continue to benefit both the department and the residents
of Los Angeles," said Commissioner David Cunningham. "While I understand
the criticisms of my fellow commissioners, I believe that Chief Parks
could have remedied those concerns in a second term."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) said she had anticipated the
commission's decision, but was angry nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I knew that Bernard was going to be denied another five
years, and I should not feel as disgusted as I feel," said Waters, in a
phone interview from her Washington, D.C., office. "But I do feel rather
disgusted that the Police Commission has basically honored the mayor's
wishes and the mayor has paid off his political campaign debt to the
Police Protective League."</TE>
<TE>   Waters said Hahn will never recover the support he had among African
Americans. That support was rooted in the strong bond that existed
between black voters and Hahn's father, the late county Supervisor
Kenneth Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hearing disappointment, anger, people who are swearing that they
are going to teach the mayor a lesson," she said.</TE>
<TE>   John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, said his
organization would "do all we can to appeal to 10 members of the City
Council to reject the decision."</TE>
<TE>   The decision also provoked anger at the American Legion Jackie
Robinson Post 252 on Slauson Boulevard in South-Central, where about 10
members watched Caruso's statement on television. Some pounded their
fists on the bar as the decision became apparent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all over," said Claude Byrd. "I knew they were going to get rid
of him. I knew it as soon as the mayor came out against him."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, community activist and Parks booster Danny
Bakewell had been arrested when he refused to relinquish the podium
during public comments at the Police Commission meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor tainted the process," he said after the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   In a question-and-answer session after his statement, Caruso insisted
that Hahn had played no role in the commission's action.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's vote was hailed in some quarters, especially among
police officers and union officials who had chafed against what they saw
as the chief's inflexibility and lack of concern for the cop on the beat.</TE>
<TE>   Though sharp conflict between the chief and the union have long been
part of LAPD history, the rank-and-file reaction to this chief has been
intensely bitter. Late last year, the officers' union produced a report
card giving Parks mostly failing grades, and in January leaders announced
they had canvassed members and found that 93% said they had no confidence
in the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Few people were happier than Police Protective League President Mitzi
Grasso, who hovered outside the commission offices in Parker Center
shortly after the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We are pleased with the conscientious decision the Police Commission
made," she said. "We feel public safety was first and foremost in their
minds."</TE>
<TE>   The commander of LAPD's Devonshire Division, who was reprimanded by
Parks for questioning the credibility of disgraced former Rampart Officer
Rafael Perez, said it was obvious the commission took its time and made a
decision based on the merits of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect and support their decision." said Capt. Joe Curreri. "I
believe the factors that played significantly in their decision included
rising crime, the devastation to morale, the exodus of talented personnel
to other police agencies and Bernard Parks' own inflexibility,
closed-mindedness and unfair personnel practices."</TE>
<TE>   High turnover at the highest rung of policing in major agencies has
been the rule in modern times, say policing experts. The current average
tenure of a major-city police chief or sheriff--defined as those heading
forces of 1,000 officers or more--is now less than three years, said
Clark County, Nev., Sheriff Jerry Keller, president of the Major Cities
Chiefs of North America.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really tragic because they are usually moved for political
reasons, not for performance reasons," Keller said, adding that the most
common reason is the opposition of a new mayor.</TE>
<TE>   It was, in part, a search for more effective internal leadership that
led the city to Parks, then a 53-year-old career LAPD officer at odds
with Williams, who had demoted him.</TE>
<TE>   Parks was from Los Angeles, had attended Los Angeles City College, and
later earned a bachelor's degree at Pepperdine and a master's in public
administration at USC.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed to be many things Williams wasn't: an obsessively hard
worker, a hands-on administrator with a tireless interest in arcane
bureaucratic matters, a disciplinarian, and a wooden and sometimes chilly
personality.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners at the time wanted someone who could translate their
vision for the department into concrete administrative changes,
communicate with commissioners and implement reforms stemming from the
1991 Christopher Commission report that explored LAPD racism and
brutality. Then-Mayor Richard Riordan said further that he wanted a
strong chief, not a "yes man."</TE>
<TE>   Parks set about making internal changes to restore the luster of a
department with a once sterling reputation, many of which got little
public attention. He revised the command structure, churned out in-depth
management papers and revamped budgeting and long-term planning
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   He also made controversial changes, including ordering a cadre of
officers assigned to community policing--the senior lead officers--back
to patrol cars on the theory that all LAPD officers, not just a select
few, should be involved in community policing.</TE>
<TE>   The commission initially approved the effort, but the change in status
of the popular senior leads generated a strong public backlash that
reverberates to the present day. Parks was eventually forced to
backtrack, and community groups continued to be upset with his
performance in community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Parks' internal changes in the department were soon overshadowed by
what came to be known as the Rampart scandal. In March 1998, property
division staffers told their commanding officer that three kilograms of
cocaine had been checked out of evidence storage and was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Revelations continued to pile up about a group of corrupt cops
operating out of the Rampart Division who had stolen cocaine, planted
evidence and conducted themselves brutally, even once shooting a man in
the head with no justification.</TE>
<TE>   The department's response continues to generate controversy. Parks
initiated an internal investigation that produced a 356-page report
billed as a detailed exploration of not just what went wrong in Rampart,
but what was wrong with the LAPD that could have allowed such events to
occur. Parks presented the report as one of his proudest accomplishments,
saying it represented a unique effort by a big-city police department to
honestly examine its failings.</TE>
<TE>   But it left many critics of the department unsatisfied--dubious that
accountability for Rampart had been traced to the highest possible levels
of the organization, and suspicious that the department had failed to
explore the full extent of the corruption. At the same time, it produced
the opposite response from some LAPD insiders, who considered it an
overzealous attack on the entire department, when only a few officers
were culpable.</TE>
<TE>   Against Parks' initial wishes, the department eventually agreed to the
terms of a federal consent decree designed to ensure specific reforms.</TE>
<TE>   It was around the decree and other issues that friction with his
department's civilian overseers began to grow acute.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn places great weight on those disagreements, using it to justify
his claim that Parks had not overseen adequate reforms. Asked his
definition of reform, Hahn said: "The key reform is the willingness of
the LAPD, and particularly the chief and his staff, to accept the fact
that they are answerable to civilian control."</TE>
<TE>   A number of disputes emerged over the unfolding of Rampart criminal
investigations and the terms of the consent decree. Parks also parted
ways with his civilian bosses over the controversial 1999 shooting of a
mentally ill homeless woman, Margaret Mitchell; compressed work schedules
for officers; and the collection of racial profiling data.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, as city attorney, was called more than once to referee Parks'
clashes with the commission and its inspector general, and the experience
seems to have been important in shaping his present view.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Parks' changes to the department discipline system that
have perhaps marked his tenure as chief more than any other action. A key
change was the simple order that all complaints would be taken and
investigated with an eye to possible discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Parks supporters said the changes resulted in the LAPD granting a
voice to the powerless for the first time. But as complaint
investigations tripled, many within the LAPD found themselves
overwhelmed.</TE>
<TE>   Parks claims to have lately ironed out some of the problems in the
system, but not before his some officers were left reeling.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said the low state of officer morale presents broad problems for
public safety and throws into question Parks' abilities as a leader.
Parks has also been seen by those who have clashed with him as
excessively rigid and stubborn.</TE>
<TE>   Parks has argued that it is his job to disagree with overseers when he
thinks they are in error, and is dismissive of the mere suggestion that
he ought to try to be a better politician. Supporters are fond of
asserting that Parks is the best chief the city ever had; his detractors
are equally fond of asserting that he could have been the best chief the
city ever had.</TE>

<DH>Britain: Funeral and cortege for the queen mother draw a million
mourners. Nation comes to a virtual standstill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET STOBART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Britain came to a virtual standstill Tuesday morning as the country
said its last goodbye to Queen Mother Elizabeth with a funeral at
Westminster Abbey attended by more than 2,000 people inside the
centuries-old church and thousands outside.</LD>
<LD>   First Lady Laura Bush represented her husband among the mourners for
the royal great-grandmother, who died March 30 at 101.</LD>
<LD>   "The queen mother was noble in every sense of the word--serving her
family, her nation and the free world from the dark days of World War II
through the dawn of a new millennium," Laura Bush said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The lofty abbey was filled with a phalanx of European royals, Prime
Minister Tony Blair and four former prime ministers, politicians and
foreign dignitaries, newspaper editors, members of the armed forces and
the late queen's household staff, and several hundred of her friends from
charities and the horse-racing fraternity. One notable attendee was
Prince Charles' companion, Camilla Parker Bowles.</TE>
<TE>   Queen Elizabeth II arrived last, wearing a black coat and a
satin-banded black hat.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds filled Parliament Square outside the abbey, and about a million
people, many of whom had camped out for days, lined the route of the
cortege.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, supermarkets, offices and schools closed for
the morning. Most people observed a two-minute silence for the "Queen
Mum" at the start of the 11:30 a.m. rites.</TE>
<TE>   The funeral procession preceding the service was a vivid display of
regal pomp, as the coffin, draped in the queen mother's standard, passed
by on the same horse-drawn gun carriage that had carried the body of her
husband, King George VI, half a century before. The 500-yard route led
from Westminster Hall, where the queen mother had lain in state since
Friday, to Westminster Abbey.</TE>
<TE>   Prince Philip and the royal grandsons, great-grandsons andin-laws
marched solemnly behind the carriage, some in uniforms, some in dark
suits. In a break with tradition, Princess Anne, in uniform, joined them.</TE>
<TE>   Kilted soldiers playing Highland laments on bagpipes and drums
accompanied the coffin as the abbey's tenor bell tolled in the
background--101 times to mark the length of the queen mother's life.
Red-coated Irish Guards took over at the abbey entrance and carried the
coffin inside.</TE>
<TE>   The full Anglican funeral service, broadcast to the thousands waiting
silently outside, began with a reading of an anonymous poem that opened:
"You can shed tears that she is gone, or you can smile because she has
lived. You can close your eyes and hope that she'll come back, or you can
open your eyes and see all she's left."</TE>
<TE>   The service had been planned meticulously by the queen mother and her
daughter, the queen. Prayers were read by Britain's leading Anglican
clerics; the dean of Westminster, Wesley Carr; and the archbishop of
Canterbury, George Carey. Carey gave an address in which he remembered
the queen mother for "her strength, dignity and laughter." Other
participants included Scottish Free Church clerics and the Roman Catholic
primate of England, Cormac Murphy O'Connor.</TE>
<TE>   The hymns were traditional and expressed thanks as much as sorrow for
a long life well lived.</TE>
<TE>   "A very moving service indeed, but very rousing, touching, simple,"
said Brig. Christopher Price, one of the queen mother's many friends from
the racing world and the rider of a royal winner in 1979. "Although it
was a funeral, it was a thanksgiving too."</TE>
<TE>   Price said he last saw Elizabeth on March 8 at her home in Windsor.
One of her horses, First Love, had just come in a winner, "and she was
absolutely delighted--making plans for its future."</TE>
<TE>   The coffin left the abbey as trumpeters sounded the Last Post. The
cortege, now a motorcade, drove away to an aerial salute, a fly-by of
World War II vintage planes in perfect formation, in a reminder of the
royal family's war years in London.</TE>
<TE>   As the line of limousines returned to Windsor Castle, crowds along the
road threw flowers and applauded. After a private ceremony Tuesday
evening, the queen mother was buried in the vault of the George VI chapel
alongside her husband and daughter Princess Margaret, who died Feb. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Queen Elizabeth thanked the British for their "outpouring of
affection" for her mother in a nationwide address Monday evening. She
said she hoped that "sadness will blend with thanksgiving, not just for
her life but for the times in which she lived--a century not without its
trials and sorrows, but also one full of examples of courage and service
as well as fun and laughter."</TE>
<TE>   Writing Sunday in the Observer, Euan Ferguson analyzed the impetus
behind the miles-long lines of mourners who had waited, in the days
before the funeral, to glance respectfully at the royal coffin. He said
it came from the public's ability "to separate its general feelings about
the monarchy from its genuine respect for a spirited, sharp and subtle
woman whose death, though long expected, still shatters the last link to
Empire and to times and manners that once were: times which are not being
mourned but simply marked."</TE>
<TE>   During the official days of mourning, republicans and abolitionists
were quiet. A National Opinion survey over the weekend showed 54% of
respondents in favor of keeping the monarchy unchanged, 30% for radically
reforming it and 12% for abolishing it altogether.</TE>

<HD>Senate Says No to Fox Trip</HD>
<DH>Mexico: PRI officials contend that the president needs to pay more
attention to domestic issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Mexico's interparty squabbling fell to a historic low Tuesday when
the Senate denied President Vicente Fox permission to take a three-day
trip to Canada and the United States to promote trade, investment and
migrant rights.</LD>
<LD>   It was the latest flare-up of political divisiveness that has
frustrated Fox's ambitious slate of reforms. Fox wrested control of the
presidency from the long-dominant ruling party in 2000, but his National
Action Party, or PAN, lacks a majority in Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Typically, such votes, which Mexican law reserves for the upper house,
are a foregone conclusion. But a coalition of opposition parties led by
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, voted 71 to 41 to deny
permission, the first time such approval has been withheld.</LD>
<TE>   The PRI's loss to Fox ended its 71-year grip on power in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition lawmakers have complained bitterly about Fox's frequent
trips abroad--this was to have been his 16th--and his increasingly
pro-United States stance. Denying that it was an effort to embarrass Fox,
PRI officials said Tuesday that the vote was a way of sending a message
to the president to pay more attention to domestic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who said he will comply with the decision, told the nation in a
television address Tuesday night that the vote was nothing more than
"conservative parochial politics of the opposition led by the PRI." The
reasons for the trip were "to promote investment flows and commercial
exchange."</TE>
<TE>   Fox had planned to leave Monday morning and make stops in Calgary,
Vancouver, Seattle and San Francisco to address business, financial and
high-technology executives.</TE>
<TE>   He was to have had dinner with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates on
Tuesday in Seattle and to have accepted a $30-million gift from Gates'
private foundation to build libraries in Mexico, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, Fox was to have attended the inaugural ceremony for
a new kind of identity card for Mexican migrants. Mayor Willie Brown was
to have played host.</TE>
<TE>   "All this will not be possible because of the lack of vision of the
opposition, which is putting their interests above those of the nation so
that Mexico does not progress," Fox told his television audience.</TE>

<HD>Soviet-Era Automobile Still Revs Up Passion in Russia</HD>
<DH>Culture: The Volga 21, built in the 1950s and '60s, remains a
beloved icon. 'It was the only beautiful car ever made in the USSR,' one
admirer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>It is a unique sports car, custom designed and built for one
Russian multimillionaire, a black sleek dream with classic European
lines. Yet the first time its designer took the car out on Moscow roads,
it drew honks, waves of delight--and smiles of recognition.</LD>
<LD>   The sports car's design intentionally recalls the Volga 21, first
introduced 45 years ago and the only Soviet automobile that transcended
the bounds of grim functionality to encapsulate a dream.</LD>
<LD>   In the Soviet Union, cars were merely means of transport, and
designers churned out sturdy, ugly boxes on wheels. But somehow the Volga
21 rose above that. No other Russian car evokes such sentimental musings
nor such happy associations.</LD>
<TE>   Volga 21s, many now 35 and 40 years old, still raise an affectionate
smile as they ply the villages of Ukraine and Russia, bouncing from rut
to rut in the Caucasus and Central Asia, toiling over rugged mountain
tracks in Afghanistan and purring along the highways in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Born of a culture that studiously avoided the cult of consumerism, the
Volga 21 managed to capture the imagination of a generation and survived
long enough to inspire a new generation with the possibilities of Russian
design.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the only beautiful car ever made in the USSR in its entire
history," said Ivan Shishkin, 28, one of a team of young car specialists
who were so captivated by the old Volga 21 that they designed a remake
for Russian mobile phone magnate Dmitri Zimin. They made the design
sportier, retained the old taillights, installed a V-12 BMW motor and
called Zimin's sports car the Volga 12.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the Volga 21, which inspired his team, Shishkin said it was
"the only good car the average Soviet person could ever buy. This car
became a cult object."</TE>
<TE>   Zimin is chairman of VimpelCom, the first Russian company to list on
the New York Stock Exchange. His large car collection includes two
Bentleys and a Volga 21.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Lomakov, who runs Moscow's Volga 21 club, is a fanatic, a
master of trivia associated with the old car. He said it symbolizes
family life for older club members. One elderly woman brings her grandson
to work on the family's Volga 21, which belonged to her late husband.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a family pet for them," Lomakov explained, standing in a
large yard crammed with rusted, battered Volga 21s belonging to club
members.</TE>
<TE>   "The Volga is my childhood," said Yuri Maximov, a 33-year-old member
who has two Volga 21s. "My father lived for the car. And when I was 5 or
6, he even let me steer it. It was the biggest and the best car of all."</TE>
<TE>   Maximov's 73-year-old neighbor, Gennady Kubrin, lives in his own vague
world. But the old man brightens up when Maximov drives up in a Volga 21.</TE>
<TE>   Kubrin bought one of the cars at age 30, and finally had to sell the
beloved auto a year ago for want of somewhere to park it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I drive my Volga into the yard, he comes down and asks for
permission just to sit for a while in my car," said Maximov of his
neighbor. The old man sits there for five minutes, transported into the
past, then shuffles away.</TE>
<TE>   Sofia Landau, 54, a professor of physics at the Moscow Aviation
Institute, has been driving Volga 21s since the early 1980s. People often
wander up to her car, full of questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it like a living creature," she gushed about her car. "It's
connected with all my warm memories of wonderful trips out into the
country when my daughter was small. I'd call it the car that represents
Russia's resurrection from the ashes after World War II."</TE>
<TE>   Anton Smirnsky, an artist, never drove until five years ago, when he
spotted a bright pink Volga 21.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment I saw this car I knew I must have it. Its forms, lines,
its curves and of course its fantastic color. I keep it as an object of
beauty, as a work of art. Driving it is like sailing a wonderful boat."</TE>
<TE>   "This car symbolizes all the best things we had in the past," said
Anatoly Mikhailov, 33, who designed Zimin's Volga 12. "All the childhood
and youth reminiscences are connected with it. That's why we decided to
do a remake."</TE>
<TE>   The Volga 21 was made available only to the Soviet elite: professors,
scientists, managers, judges, KGB officers, party members.</TE>
<TE>   The earliest model, the Festival, had an 8-inch Soviet star on the
grille and a leaping reindeer statuette on the hood--always the first
item to be stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Production stopped in 1969, with many people still on a waiting list
to buy. This led to a rash of homemade models, assembled in sheds from
spare parts till about the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   There was one model called the Volga 23-23, nicknamed the
"Catchme-Catchme" because it had a V-8 motor from the Soviet Chaika
limousine. It was used by the KGB or government ministers who wanted to
mingle anonymously with masses but still go faster.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Soviet Union, there was a very strict hierarchy, and this
particularly concerned cars," said Lomakov, the club leader. "Party
officials who did not have the right to drive a Chaika limousine tried to
get the Volga 23-23 or modified their Volgas by implanting the V-shaped
Chaika V-8 motor. You could always find a mechanic who would do it for
you on the sly."</TE>
<TE>   The Volga 21 station wagon, used for ambulances and taxis, was
nicknamed "The Shed" because of the voluminous interior.</TE>
<TE>   But even the sedan was big inside. You could fold down the bench front
seat to make a bed. Landau and her family camped in the car, sometimes
getting bogged down in fields in the dark.</TE>
<TE>   Mikhailov and his partner Shishkin personify a new generation of
Russian designers whose creed is perfection. They aim to shoot down the
cliched view of Russian mechanical design as functional but ugly and
unreliable.</TE>
<TE>   Catering to the rich, Mikhailov and Shishkin make custom cars that
will never go into mass production. The Volga 12 was their first, and
they are working on several other designs.</TE>
<TE>   Putting the Volga 12 through some tough tests, the Russian car
magazine AutoRevue was highly complimentary: "The pressure is wild, but
it goes as if it's on rails." The magazine was not so flattering about
the old Volga 21's capacities under similar stress. "It's scary, but it
doesn't flip over."</TE>
<TE>   The Volga 21, said Lomakov, is "not subtle in its steering. It feels
more like a ship than a car."</TE>
<TE>   When Mikhailov took the new Volga onto the streets, Russians saw
something old and familiar in a modern, respectable reincarnation. It was
a sunny spring day, and he drove the car round and round the city's outer
ring road, logging 180 miles in a day.</TE>
<TE>   "It was amazing to see people's faces. They looked as if they had seen
a UFO land," he recalled. "Everyone was laughing, smiling. The feeling I
experienced in that car was incomparable."</TE>
<TE>   At a photo shoot of the car at Red Square, a crowd gathered.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few of them could believe the car was made in Russia. When they
found out it was, they felt proud. . . . We have a lot of talented
people. They just need minimum conditions to create a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Mikhailov and Shishkin see their Volga 12 not as a means of transport
nor even a cult object but a work of art.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Opens His Campaign</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LAHORE, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf launched a campaign to extend his rule
Tuesday, proclaiming at an elaborately staged rally that his military
government had saved Pakistan from being branded a terrorist state.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of thousands of people were bused into the park where Pakistan's
independence movement began in 1940 to hear Musharraf's campaign
speech--the first of the general's political career.</LD>
<LD>   Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless 1999 coup, has called an
April 30 referendum to extend his rule by five years and to expand the
powers of the president and of the military ahead of parliamentary
elections in the fall that will restore civilian rule.</LD>
<TE>   "The future of democracy in Pakistan is in your hands," Musharraf told
the crowd at Minar-e-Pakistan park. "On the day of the referendum, you
people have to decide: Do you want to return Pakistan to the people who
looted our country? Do you want to end my reforms?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," the crowd responded, with little enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   The constitution calls for the president to be elected by parliament,
which will be chosen in October. Musharraf, who dissolved parliament when
he took power, said the referendum was constitutional--and called anyone
who says otherwise a hypocrite.</TE>
<TE>   His speech reflected his lack of campaign experience. Wearing a
camouflage uniform, Musharraf ran through his accomplishments as
president but never energized the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf repeated his key argument that he needed to stay in power to
ensure that his economic, political and social reforms were not reversed
by corrupt politicians.</TE>
<TE>   He lashed out at Pakistan's last two prime ministers, saying they
looted the country and now live in opulence abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Those two former leaders--Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif--are in
exile but still head Pakistan's two largest political parties. Both
parties are boycotting what they call an unconstitutional and fraudulent
referendum.</TE>

<LD>A suspected member of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network was
formally charged Tuesday with waging war against India, an offense
punishable by death, and then freed on bail because of a technicality.</LD>
<LD>   Indian police claim that Mohammed Afroz, a pilot from the Bombay area,
confessed to being part of an Al Qaeda plan to hijack a plane and crash
it into the British Parliament in London. He also reportedly told
investigators that he was planning to attack buildings in Australia and
the Indian capital, New Delhi.</LD>
<LD>   Afroz, who had been detained since Oct. 2, was formally charged with
waging war against India's government and conspiring to commit an offense
against the state.</LD>
<TE>   Although the charges do not allow for bail, a judge ordered Afroz, 26,
freed on $2,000 bail because he had been held illegally for more than six
months, said his lawyer, Mobil Solkar.</TE>

<DL>BAMIAN, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>A year after the Taliban blew up two towering ancient Buddha
statues, Afghan interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai promised Tuesday to
rebuild them, calling their destruction "a national tragedy."</LD>
<LD>   Funding the project will be no small task for this nation's bankrupt
administration. But Karzai said rebuilding the statues was part of
reconstructing Afghanistan, a nation devastated by war for more than two

<LD>   "The loss of life is something irreparable. You cannot repair that,"
Karzai said during a five-hour visit to the central Afghan town of
Bamian, site of the statues. "But we're going to work on this, and we
hope we can have it rebuilt as soon as possible."</LD>
<TE>   Karzai said an Afghan sculptor, who returned this month after fleeing
the nation 23 years ago, presented him with a design to reconstruct the
figures within five years.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai toured the ruins of the two statues in a convoy with Afghan
troops, many of whom also stood guard along dusty roads and hillsides
about 80 miles northwest of the capital, Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear where the money to rebuild the statues would come from
or when the project might begin.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai said his administration had contacted the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization for help. Paris-based UNESCO is
responsible for safeguarding the world's cultural heritage.</TE>
<TE>   The Buddhas, one 175 feet tall and the other 120 feet, were carved
about 1,600 years ago into a huge cliff overlooking Bamian.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamentalist Taliban movement considered them idolatrous and
against the tenets of Islam, so the militia dynamited them a year ago
despite an international outcry.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan sculptor Amanulah Haiderzad said the government might rebuild
only the larger Buddha and keep the remnants of smaller one as a monument
to Taliban barbarity.</TE>

<HD>Strike Disrupts Oil Flow in Venezuela</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Union and business groups stage protest that closes
down industries. President tries to prevent media coverage of the unrest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>One of the world's largest oil refineries virtually shut down and
industries and businesses closed Tuesday during a general strike that
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez tried to keep off radio and TV.</LD>
<LD>   Strikers at the headquarters of Venezuela's state oil monopoly clashed
with dozens of Chavez supporters before 500 police officers used tear gas
to separate the two sides. One group of strike supporters severely beat
at least six pro-government protesters.</LD>
<LD>   Large industry and commerce closed after the 1-million-member
Venezuelan Workers Confederation and Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest
business federation, called a 24-hour nationwide strike supporting an
ongoing work slowdown at the government oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela, or PDVSA.</LD>
<TE>   Late Tuesday, workers confederation chief Carlos Ortega extended the
strike by 24 hours, or until Thursday morning, insisting that the
government meet oil workers' demands.</TE>
<TE>   PDVSA workers are protesting a company board appointed Feb. 25 by
Chavez, saying the board is unqualified and will tighten Chavez's control
over a corporation that cherishes its autonomy. Chavez insists that the
board is qualified and that Venezuelan law gives him authority to make
the appointments.</TE>
<TE>   The slowdown has oil markets on alert after Iraq's decision to stop
oil exports for 30 days in furtherance of its demand that Israeli forces
leave Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq and Venezuela, both OPEC members, jointly export about 4.5
million barrels of oil per day. Venezuela is among the top four oil
exporters worldwide, sending nearly 1 million barrels of crude daily to
the United States alone. That makes it the No. 3 U.S. supplier.</TE>
<TE>   Labor and business leaders declared Tuesday's strike a success, with
an 80% compliance rate. But Fedecamaras director Gregorio Rojas
acknowledged that it wasn't as sweeping as a Dec. 10 strike that
virtually paralyzed the country. Tuesday's strike, he noted, was called
only on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's TV and radio stations could not independently report the
strike for much of the day because Chavez used a law forcing them to
broadcast government transmissions. Transmissions Monday and Tuesday
showed people at work, pro-government rallies and claims that the strike
was a failure. Though by late Tuesday, the broadcasts were tapering off.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to overthrow this government," Chavez said. "I can
tell the country, the world, that the country isn't paralyzed, the
situation is absolutely normal. . . . Oil is being produced and being
exported."</TE>

<LD>Corruption in the Mexican legal system appears to have "continued
unabated" despite attempts at reform in recent years, the United Nations
investigator into judicial independence said.</LD>
<LD>   "The level of impunity and corruption in Mexico is a wide societal
problem brought on by a political system controlled for nearly a century
by a single party that did not need to account for its acts," Param
Cumaraswamy told the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking for the Mexican government delegation, diplomat Arturo
Hernandez Basave acknowledged that much remained to be done in the fight
against impunity and "in repairing lack of confidence of the population
in the judicial system."</LD>

<LD>A Basque separatist was sentenced to 13 years in jail for
conspiring to assassinate Spanish King Juan Carlos I in a 1995 plot.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors say Jose Javier Arizkuren Ruiz, who was sentenced Monday,
helped organize a plot to shoot the king with a high-powered rifle from
an apartment as Juan Carlos vacationed aboard a royal yacht.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say the designated shooter, another Basque, had the king
in the rifle's cross hairs three times over the course of a few days in
July and August of 1995 but did not pull the trigger because his escape
was not assured.</LD>

<HD>Powell Promises U.S. Monitors if Truce Is Reached</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Secretary, on high-stakes peace mission, will arrive
earlier than planned and is to meet with Arafat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>On the second leg of his Mideast diplomatic rescue mission,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell held talks Tuesday with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and pledged that the United States will offer to
deploy American observers between Israel and the Palestinians if the two
sides agree to a cease-fire.</LD>
<LD>   Key Arab leaders are insisting on an observer force as a condition for
supporting the Powell mission, but Israel has at various times either
rejected the idea or called for the mandate and makeup of such a force to
be limited.</LD>
<LD>   In a reflection of the growing sense of urgency behind the mission,
the secretary is now planning to arrive in Israel on Thursday, a day
earlier than originally scheduled, after stops in Europe and Jordan.
Powell has built his trip around winning broad Arab and international
backing for what he called "a powerful message" to take to both Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat when he reaches Jerusalem.</LD>
<TE>   Powell confirmed Tuesday that he intends to meet with Arafat. He said
his mission is open-ended, with no set departure date.</TE>
<TE>   He also revealed that the United States has reached out to Syria and,
through intermediaries, to Iran to help prevent the crisis from spilling
over into Lebanon, where Hezbollah guerrillas have been engaged in
sporadic cross-border firefights with Israeli troops on two fronts. The
United States has asked both Syria and Iran, which provide aid to and
have influence over the Lebanese militia, to help "contain" the attacks,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Powell conceded that the Arab world is more enraged each day that
Israel is not heeding U.S., U.N., European and other international calls
to end its military incursion into Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   The secretary telephoned Sharon on Tuesday and pressed him again to
act faster to pull troops and tanks from Palestinian areas. Powell said
Sharon replied that he is anxious to conclude the operation and remains
committed to negotiations, although the prime minister offered no
timetable.</TE>
<TE>   "We must expedite the end of this operation and the withdrawal,"
Powell said.</TE>
<TE>Credibility Under Fire</TE>
<TE>   But after 13 Israeli soldiers were killed Tuesday in the Jenin refugee
camp in the West Bank--the deadliest incident to hit the Israeli military
since the Palestinian uprising erupted more than 18 months ago--Sharon
announced that the incursion would continue, dimming the hopes for an
imminent cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   With each day that passes, the credibility of both Sharon and the Bush
administration comes under new fire. In talks with Saudi, Moroccan and
Egyptian leaders, Powell has confronted criticism of Israeli defiance and
deepening alarm about its long-term consequences for the region and the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us stand to lose if this situation goes unabated," Egyptian
presidential spokesman Nabil Osman said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Powell acknowledged hearing tough warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't stunned by what I heard, but I heard it in spades from
everyone I talked to," he told reporters on his plane.</TE>
<TE>   Powell has tried to assuage the concerns of Arab leaders during his
trip by supporting their four principal demands: an Israeli withdrawal
from Palestinian territory, the deployment of U.S. monitors, the
rebuilding of Palestinian institutions destroyed by Israel, and talks on
a political solution to the Mideast conflict occurring simultaneously
with discussions of long-term security arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries have been pressing Powell
this week for U.S. monitors to help sustain peace if a cease-fire is
achieved and "to see what happened is not repeated," Egyptian Foreign
Minister Ahmed Maher said at a joint news conference with the secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Washington is willing to offer monitors, although there
appears to be a gap between how the Arabs and the United States view a
monitoring force.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we get into a cease-fire . . . the United States is prepared to
put U.S. observers on the ground. That would help with the
confidence-building, the restoring of trust between these two sides--get
us back to where we were a few years ago," Powell said at the news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush first signed on to the idea of sending U.S.
observers--under appropriate circumstances--during a summit of the Group
of 8 industrialized nations in Italy last summer. But the administration
envisions observers as primarily nonmilitary personnel serving largely to
monitor activity and provide counsel in the event of problems, Powell
told reporters traveling with him en route to Spain for talks with his
European counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "We might draw from our diplomatic presence or send someone from State
or other agencies that could monitor activity and performance. . . . But
this is not an interim force to keep people from shooting each other," he
said.</TE>
<TE>Powell Sees Much Work</TE>
<TE>   Powell talked for the first time Tuesday about the vital need to
support the rebuilding of Palestinian facilities and infrastructure
damaged since Israel began its incursion 12 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of work is going to be needed to reconstitute the institutions
on the Palestinian side. They will need the means to act, and that has
been damaged severely," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And in a tactical shift, Washington is no longer siding with Israel's
demand that a cease-fire and security arrangements must precede political
talks.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to link security and a political process together so people
can see not just a cease-fire, as important as that is, but something
beyond a cease-fire--a political settlement that will move us in the
right direction to the creation of a Palestinian state," Powell said in
Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   But until a cease-fire is reached, Arab anguish continues to mount.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the darkest chapter in the Mideast process," said Osman, the
Egyptian presidential spokesman. "We're not asking for the moon. How much
[blood] must be lost before we reach an end?"</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment was underscored by the 20,000 students who turned out
at two Egyptian universities to protest during Powell's visit and by
comments in the Egyptian media. Channel II television called for an Arab
boycott of some U.S. goods.</TE>
<TE>   "Our humble weapon remains eating beans instead of hamburgers," one
popular program proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Many papers carried scathing editorials.</TE>
<TE>   "The continuation of Washington's blind bias toward Sharon pushes the
region to more explosions that may have dire results for American
interests," the pro-government Al Ahram warned in an editorial.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's "political ignorance and human indifference" are
responsible for its "passivity toward this barbarism," editor Galal
Dowidar wrote in the pro-government Al Akhbar.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Nafie, editor in chief of Al Ahram, put it more succinctly:
"Enough maneuvering."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Puts Off Vote at U.N.</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Palestinian and Israeli envoys exchange bitter words
amid Security Council debate on Jewish state's West Bank incursions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS
</DL>
<LD>On a day of bitter public argument between Israeli and Palestinian
representatives, the United States on Tuesday averted a broader
diplomatic rift over the Middle East by forcing postponement of a vote on
an Arab-backed Security Council resolution condemning Israel's West Bank
incursions.</LD>
<LD>   Arab envoys said they might press for a vote as early as today. But
other diplomats appeared to have little enthusiasm for a divisive debate
on a declaration almost certain to provoke a U.S. veto and that would
probably have little impact even if it passed.</LD>
<LD>   The 15-member council is suffering from "resolution fatigue," said one
U.S. diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the three
Middle East resolutions passed with U.S. support in the last four weeks.
Two of them also called for Israel's withdrawal from West Bank cities.</LD>
<TE>   "The Security Council should get out of the business of producing
documents," said James B. Cunningham, the deputy U.S. representative
here. "The focus of activity is now where it should be, in the region,
with Secretary [of State Colin L.] Powell engaging in all his contacts."</TE>
<TE>   Other permanent members of the council agreed that further U.N. action
would not help Powell's negotiations, and the secretary of State's
mission was strongly endorsed Monday by most council members and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   The council has met on the Middle East crisis for 11 of the last 12
days, with members expressing deep frustration at their inability to get
Israel to heed demands to withdraw from West Bank areas it has reoccupied
and, to a lesser extent, to get Palestinian leaders to renounce violence.</TE>
<TE>   Members also have repeatedly voiced anger at reports by U.N. agencies
of Israeli soldiers entering U.N. hospitals and schools and allegedly
keeping ambulances and U.N. aid officials out of refugee camps.</TE>
<TE>   The council's latest Middle East debate began Monday and ended Tuesday
with heated clashes between the usually even-tempered Yehuda Lancry,
Israel's U.N. ambassador, and Nasser Kidwa, the coolly professional
Palestinian representative.</TE>
<TE>   Lancry accused Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, Kidwa's
uncle, of personally arming and supervising Palestinian terror squads.
Kidwa derided the charges as "silly and stupid," language Lancry angrily
said was inappropriate in such a forum.</TE>
<TE>   But the bitterest exchange invoked the explosive memory of the
Holocaust, with Lancry accusing Kidwa and other Arabs in the Security
Council debate of comparing Israel's treatment of Palestinians to the
mass murder of European Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "Such analogies are absolutely indefensible and offensive," Lancry
said. He then went on to link Palestinian terrorists to the legacy of the
Holocaust, saying suicide bombers were the "spiritual progeny" of Nazi
ideologues.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwa denied making a comparison to the Holocaust, saying he was
instead equating Israeli incursions into the West Bank with the Nazi
occupation of cities throughout Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "What the Israeli army has been doing against our people does not
differ in many aspects from what the German armies, the Nazi German
armies, did in many European cities, and against the inhabitants of those
cities," Kidwa said.</TE>

<HD>Chirac Visits Paris Mosque to Condemn 'Odious Attacks'</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday made the first visit by a
French head of state to Paris' Grand Mosque in 76 years to denounce a
spate of attacks on Jewish sites and call for unity between French Jews
and Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Synagogues, schools and cemeteries around the country have been
targeted, often with firebombs, in the last two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   In the most serious case, a Marseille synagogue was burned to the
ground March 31.</LD>
<TE>   "I want to reiterate here with you how much these odious attacks
aren't worthy of our country," Chirac said.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest episode, a bomb was lobbed Tuesday night at a synagogue
in the Paris suburb of Garges-les-Gonesse but did not explode, officials
said. The site was also targeted over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have coincided with an escalation in Middle East violence
and have heightened tensions between French Jews and the country's Muslim
community.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac's visit to the mosque was the first by a French head of state
since 1926. Dalil Boubakeur, head of the mosque, called on Muslim youths
to respect all religious sites in France.</TE>

<HD>Germany Calls On Allies to Back 'Peace Quartet'</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Initiative calls for salvaging previous pacts and would
involve the U.S., EU, U.N. and Russia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN
</DL>
<LD>German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer lobbied Russia and other
allies Tuesday to back an initiative that would deploy international
forces to keep Israeli and Palestinian combatants apart.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate move coordinated with other European states, Germany
also imposed stricter controls on delivery of weapons and munitions to
Israel to avoid contributing to any escalation of the crisis, a
government official said.</LD>
<LD>   The "idea paper" disclosed to German media and discussed with visiting
Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov proposes salvaging the goals of
moribund peace plans forged in Oslo and at Camp David and uniting the
diplomatic powers of Washington, Moscow, the European Union and the
United Nations.</LD>
<TE>   Although officials at Fischer's office here cautioned that the
"quartet for peace" plan is still in its inception, they confirmed that
the emerging blueprint will be ready for presentation at a meeting of EU
foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just an idea paper at this stage, but in view of the importance
of the Middle East at the moment, it was a logical matter for discussion
between Fischer and Ivanov at their meeting today," Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Antje Leendertse said.</TE>
<TE>   Ivanov accompanied Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on an official
visit with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder for talks on bilateral affairs in
the eastern city of Weimar. The two leaders were expected to take up
broader security matters such as the Mideast conflict and the U.S.-led
campaign against terrorism today.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Fischer nor Ivanov disclosed any details of their discussions.
But brief accounts of the draft peace initiative leaked to two leading
German newspapers suggested that the first step in a seven-point agenda
would be a cease-fire and deployment of a peacekeeping force to ensure
"the complete separation of the conflict parties."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops should withdraw immediately from occupied Palestinian
territories and remain within the borders of Israel that existed before
1967, Fischer's plan reportedly stipulates. It also calls for the
clearing out of Israeli settlements in the territories and, after an
unspecified period of cease-fire, the establishment of a Palestinian
state.</TE>
<TE>   Within two years, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily of Munich explained,
agreements on the future of Jerusalem and permanent borders would be
negotiated.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer began work on his initiative because a third party was needed
to resolve the sharpening conflict in which neither Israel nor the
Palestinian Authority has shown itself capable of finding a solution, the
Berlin daily Tagesspiegel said.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer, whose political roots are in the pacifist movements that
condemned the Vietnam War and the superpower arms race, has been in close
consultation with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Ivanov, EU
presidency officials from Spain and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
the Sueddeutsche reported.</TE>
<TE>   Both newspapers likened the quartet of intermediaries to the Balkans
Contact Group that was created to deal with the war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began 10 years ago and dragged on until the
Dayton, Ohio, peace accords took effect nearly four years later. That
intervention effort also pooled the resources of the transatlantic
allies.</TE>
<TE>   Schroeder also weighed in Tuesday to push a European initiative to
halt Mideast fighting, telling the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung
that peace could be achieved in the region only through "external
pressure." He also spoke in favor of international military engagement.
"If there is a chance for peace, then the U.N. will have to think about
this, and not just about observers," he told the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer's proposal echoes recent U.N. Security Council resolutions,
the Berlin daily noted, warning that states that "continue to support
terrorism or shelter terrorist organizations or their members will be
politically and economically isolated."</TE>
<TE>   Germany's foreign and economic development ministries declined to
confirm or deny reports in Israeli media that Germany, France and Britain
have agreed to halt exports of weapons or spare parts for Israeli tanks
and armored vehicles. But one government official, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Berlin is "examining on a case-by-case basis" any
commercial deliveries to the region to prevent escalation. No materiel
has been delivered to Israel in recent weeks, he said, but he declined to
call the export delays an "embargo."</TE>
<TE>   In a dispatch from Jerusalem, the German news agency Deutsche
Presse-Agentur reported that Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer has written to Fischer to protest delays in the delivery of
spare parts to the Israel Defense Forces. It quoted Israeli media reports
as saying that Ben-Eliezer had told German officials to bear in mind
their country's Nazi past in weighing changes to its trade and foreign
policy.</TE>

<HD>FBI Criticized on Data Access</HD>
<DH>Security: A rule lifting restrictions on secret materials to help
fight terrorism could aid spies, lawmakers are told.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Top FBI officials may have done "substantial" damage to the
bureau's internal security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks by
rushing to lift restrictions on secret intelligence information that was
once tightly guarded, officials told members of Congress on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   A little-noticed FBI decision last October allowing wider access to
material obtained through top-secret wiretaps has made it much easier for
thousands of agents around the country to chase down terrorist leads and
probe possible links to the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, however, that decision has made secret documents
available to many agents with no legitimate need to see them--and has
risked a repeat of the consequences of last year's Robert Philip Hanssen
spy case, according to a newly released report on FBI security. The
report, from a commission headed by former FBI and CIA director William
H. Webster, got its first public airing Tuesday at a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosure of yet another security vulnerability at the FBI gives
added ammunition to congressional critics who are frustrated by the slow
pace of reforms at the bureau and are pushing for wide-scale changes.</TE>
<TE>   The issue also underscores what Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) called
the "inherent tension" between the FBI's sometimes conflicting roles as
the country's chief investigative agency and the keeper of many of its
national secrets. Sen. Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) even suggested that Congress
consider splitting the FBI, making one part responsible for law
enforcement and the other for intelligence functions, as the British do.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the way the FBI maintains records and intelligence
collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a law giving
the FBI the power, by order of a secret court, to eavesdrop on
individuals considered possible agents of hostile governments.</TE>
<TE>   Such material generally cannot be used in criminal prosecutions, and
as a result its use had been closely guarded within the FBI and
segregated from other case files. But agents pursuing terrorist ties
after Sept. 11 complained that they were frustrated by their limited
access to files that could be relevant, and under an October directive
approved by Director Robert Mueller's former top deputy, the FBI
significantly loosened those restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   But Webster noted in his report that the FBI's senior security
officials were never consulted about the far-reaching decision, and he
called it another example of how "operational imperatives often trump
security needs."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is so severe, Webster told the committee, that agents in
the New York FBI office have been reluctant to enter information into the
bureau's computer system because "they knew that then it was available to
anybody."</TE>
<TE>   There have been no known security breaches so far, officials said. But
Webster said that if secret information should get into the wrong hands,
the identities of confidential government sources could be revealed
and--as happened at least three times in the case of Hanssen, the FBI
agent-turned-Russian spy--agents working secretly for the United States
could then be killed. The Hanssen case was the impetus for the creation
of the Webster Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a substantial risk of damage here," Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said that the change in restrictions had not produced
"wholesale" access to top-secret material, but they acknowledged that
they may have overlooked critical security issues while pressing the war
on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Did [top FBI officials] create a vulnerability? Yes. Should they have
consulted with the security people? Yes. But we don't have any indication
of any damage caused by that," an FBI official who asked not to be
identified said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said Webster's concerns have prompted several recent
"modifications" to the system, including labeling material that
originated with a foreign intelligence warrant and once again "locking
down" some non-terrorist material that had been released for bureau-wide
use since October.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's explanations did little to appease Democrats or Republicans
on the judiciary panel, several of whom angrily suggested that the FBI
had failed to take the lessons of the Hanssen debacle to heart.</TE>
<TE>   A frustrated Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the committee chairman,
said at the hearing that he was deeply concerned by the potential damage
that the FBI's security changes could cause. "I cannot underscore how
much attention I want given to this," he told senior FBI officials
testifying before him.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy said it was ironic that even after the FBI convinced Congress
last year to give it broader powers to monitor foreign agents--with the
assurance that such information would be tightly guarded--"they've put a
lot of that on the computer system that just about everybody in the FBI
could get hold of."</TE>
<TE>   Committee members said the issue fit a troubling pattern of
inattention to security at the FBI, as documented in the Webster report.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-month study found that the FBI missed numerous warning signals
that could have tipped them off to Hanssen's 22-year career as a Russian
spy. Hanssen was found to have hacked into a supervisor's computer, but
he explained at the time that he did it to show how vulnerable the
computer system was--and FBI officials believed him.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, FBI agents said they feel caught in a Catch-22
situation. The public is demanding more aggressive terrorist probes and
more information on the government's terrorist alerts, while Congress is
demanding ever-tightened security, some agents say.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just one of those situations where we can't win," one veteran
agent said after the hearing. "You have big-city police chiefs claiming
that the FBI is sitting on [terrorist] information, then you have
congressional . . . committees suggesting that we have been too open with
the information. It's tough to know what to do."</TE>

<HD>Accused Priest Who Killed Self Is Remembered at Mass</HD>
<DH>Funeral: Bishop, criticized for doing too little to safeguard
children, officiates a day after suspending 9 priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARMA, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>A day after he suspended nine more clergymen in a growing child
molestation investigation in the Cleveland diocese, Bishop Anthony Pilla
said the funeral Mass Tuesday for an accused priest who killed himself
last week.</LD>
<LD>   Pilla, face grim, rose to address those gathered to bury Father Donald
A. Rooney.</LD>
<LD>   In front of him was a church so full that parishioners stood several
deep in the back. To his right, more than 100 fellow Roman Catholic
priests dressed in vestments formed a sea of white in the sanctuary of
St. Anthony of Padua, where Rooney last served.</LD>
<TE>   Pilla spoke first to the mother who lost her 48-year-old son to
suicide last week amid accusations that he had molested a little girl at
his first parish more than 20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "No one here today understands what you are going through today,"
Pilla said to Rooney's mother, Mary Lou Vasitas. "Despite all the painful
circumstances, Don was your son and you loved him very much. And you have
many wonderful memories of your life with Don and I know that you have
been told many, many good things about Don's service. I urge you to hold
on to that life and cherish those memories and leave the rest to a
merciful God."</TE>
<TE>   Pilla has been under heavy criticism in recent weeks for doing too
little to protect children in the diocese from predatory priests. Before
the charge against Rooney was made last week, Pilla harshly reviewed his
past response to such charges and vowed to enforce a more open policy.</TE>
<TE>   It was in this highly sensitive climate that a woman came forward to
tell church officials that Rooney molested her when she was a child and
he was assigned to the Sacred Heart parish in Wadsworth, Ohio. The week
before, Pilla suspended a 40-year veteran priest on the basis of a single
complaint--the first such suspension in Cleveland since the sexual abuse
scandal broke nationally.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout here continues.</TE>
<TE>   Local prosecutors issued a grand jury subpoena Friday requiring the
diocese to turn over all records related to child abuse allegations.
Church officials acknowledged the subpoena expedited Pilla's suspension
of nine more active priests, including the diocese's vicar of justice.
The men, church officials said, had all been evaluated and treated at the
time the now years-old allegations were made and then returned to the
ministry. They have all been asked to leave church housing pending a
criminal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Pilla also released the names of 12 former or retired priests who had
histories of child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the suicide of a priest shocked nearly everyone in this heavily
Catholic community. A handful of priests accused of sexual abuse of
children have killed themselves in the last decade, but Rooney's suicide
was the first since the child molestation scandal in the U.S. Catholic
Church became national news.</TE>
<TE>   Pilla acknowledged at the funeral Mass Tuesday that the circumstances
of Rooney's death have been difficult for him to bear.</TE>
<TE>   "Brothers and sisters in Christ," he said, "I think you understand
just how painful this time has been for me."</TE>
<TE>   Rooney, a lifelong Cleveland resident who was ordained in 1979, died
of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being asked to meet with Pilla on
Wednesday morning for an undisclosed reason. He never showed up and was
found the next day in his car, a bullet in his head. Since his death,
church officials have acknowledged more people have leveled accusations
against him.</TE>
<TE>   Pilla announced the day Rooney's body was found that he would be given
a full Catholic burial. Shortly after, Pilla said he would officiate at
the funeral Mass.</TE>
<TE>   The church, which long denied funerals to suicide victims, more
recently has left such decisions up to the discretion of bishops who are
asked to consider whether the person who took his or her own life was
under severe mental stress or excessive fear of hardship or suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Pilla spoke Tuesday of how Rooney's decision to end his own life
affected others. "We feel remorse. We feel terrible pain. We even feel
guilty and maybe we look for someone to blame and maybe we blame
ourselves," Pilla said as many in attendance wept.</TE>
<TE>   "What can I offer to any of you as we gather at this time?" he asked.
"Words seem so weak and maybe even profane in the midst of the death of
Father Don Rooney. Only silence seems to be called for and yet we human
beings . . . need and . . . seek meaning in the face of life's tragic
circumstances and experiences."</TE>
<TE>   In recent letters to Cleveland's Catholics, Pilla called sexual abuse
of children a "terrible tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   But he did not speak directly Tuesday about the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   "We can never know what takes place in the heart of another human
being. . . ," he said. "We cannot conclude and we should not conclude
that his life and death had no meaning or were rejected by God. What we
must do is to pray and hope that God's healing love touched Father
Rooney."</TE>

<HD>Drinking Takes Toll on Campuses</HD>
<DH>Health: Deaths, injuries and sex attacks are cited in study. A
report recommends 'changing the culture' at colleges.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Drinking by U.S. college students contributes to 1,400 deaths, half
a million injuries and 70,000 sexual assaults a year, according to a
three-year review of existing studies released Tuesday by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.</LD>
<LD>   The study also found that 2.1 million students--one-fourth of college
students ages 18 to 24--drove under the influence of alcohol during the
last year.</LD>
<LD>   "The harm that college students do to themselves and others as a
result of excessive drinking exceeds what many would have expected," said
Ralph W. Hingson, professor of social behavioral sciences at Boston
University's School of Public Health and the study's lead author.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the study, published in the March issue of the Journal
of Studies on Alcohol, the institute's Task Force on College Drinking
issued a companion report that offers suggestions on how to curb the
problem of college-age drinking. The 59-page report recommends "changing
the culture of drinking at U.S. colleges."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Goldman, co-chairman of the task force that produced the report,
says the study and the report together document how severe the problem
is.</TE>
<TE>   "Our society has always dealt with this with a wink and a nod, as a
rite of passage," said Goldman, a psychology research professor at the
University of South Florida. "But the statistics that Ralph Hingson has
put together are stunning to all of us, even the most seasoned
researchers."</TE>
<TE>   The task force, in an unusual twist, brought together scientific
researchers who had been studying the problem and university presidents
who had been dealing with the results. The 36-member group, which also
included students, took a pragmatic tack, suggesting solutions tailored
to specific schools and involving the larger community around the school.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of those cases of squeezing the balloon," said Goldman.
"A dry campus just drives the problem off campus. The community has to be
on the same page."</TE>
<TE>   Issued two days before National Alcohol Screening Day at 550 colleges
and universities, the study found that:</TE>
<TE>   * Most students drink moderately or abstain--in fact, the proportion
of nondrinkers has increased in recent years to 19%--but about 40% of
students engage in "binge drinking," defined as five or more drinks in a
row for men or four or more in a row for women.</TE>
<TE>   * The binge drinkers account for nearly 70% of all alcohol consumed by
college students, and drinking rates are highest among incoming freshmen,
males, athletes and members of fraternities and sororities.</TE>
<TE>   * Students at two-year colleges, religious schools, commuter schools
or predominantly or historically black colleges and universities drink
the least.</TE>
<TE>   But the report concludes that "the fallout from excessive consumption
does not discriminate. It threatens the health and safety of all
students."</TE>
<TE>   The task force was formed several years ago, after Scott Krueger, an
18-year-old freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died
after a weekend bout of drinking at a fraternity. Ever since, national
fraternal organizations say they have required alcohol education on
campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to tackle the problem," said Dan Bureau, assistant dean
of students and coordinator of Greek affairs at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau says most fraternities now require alcohol education programs,
some of which use an interactive CD-ROM that lets students test their
drinking limits as a video game, instead of in a car or on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing a lot around education, but it's a hard thing to
overcome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism is part of the
National Institutes of Health.</TE>

<LD>Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, fighting the Bush administration's plan to
put the nation's first permanent nuclear waste dump in his state,
delivered his veto of the project to Congress, which now has 90 working
days to sustain or override him.</LD>
<LD>   "We have an uphill battle," said Guinn, flanked by members of Nevada's
congressional delegation who have struggled to round up lawmakers to
oppose President Bush's approval of Yucca Mountain as the burial site.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Larry E. Craig of Idaho, a member of the Republican leadership,
predicted the chamber would override the veto, but said it may have to
clear a number of Democratic procedural hurdles.</LD>

<HD>Accused Lawyer Has a Warm, Tough Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Lynne F. Stewart is a veteran criminal lawyer who can address a
jury with the charm and clarity of a kindergarten teacher--a position she
once held in New York's public school system.</LD>
<LD>   She can be warm and grandmotherly to reporters and clients alike. At
the same time, she knows how to talk tough.</LD>
<LD>   She once called former Assistant U.S. Atty. Patrick Fitzgerald "a
crusader, and I mean that in a medieval sense." Fitzgerald was the chief
prosecutor in the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998
linked to Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<TE>   Over the years she has helped defend such clients as Larry Davis, who
was found not guilty in 1988 of the attempted murder of nine police
officers in the Bronx, and Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who was convicted in
a plot to blow up tunnels, the FBI's Manhattan headquarters and the
United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, she was in court in Brooklyn on behalf of Salvatore "Sammy
the Bull" Gravano, whose cooperation with the government played a major
role in sending John Gotti, head of the Gambino organized crime family,
to prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   Gravano was appearing at a pre-sentencing hearing after pleading
guilty last year to distributing the drug ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   "Lynne is a brilliant courtroom advocate, zealously devoted to her
clients," said Ronald L. Kuby, who worked together with Stewart on a
series of high-profile cases.</TE>
<TE>   She came to the law late after working as a school librarian and
teacher in Harlem in the 1960s, where she was first exposed to poverty,
violence and despair.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 62, the daughter of teachers, had grown up in an all-white
neighborhood in Queens. She graduated from Martin Van Buren High School
in Queens in 1957 and Wagner College in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart received her degree from Rutgers University Law School in
1975.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers who have opposed her say Stewart has an excellent memory and
is extremely prepared when she enters a courtroom. She exhibits a common
touch when it comes to pleading a case.</TE>
<TE>   She is certainly not known for her fashion sense. She wears wrinkled
clothes and has been known to come into a courthouse wearing a New York
Mets cap--her favorite baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   Her office on Broadway, which was searched Tuesday by FBI agents, is
hardly the glossy quarters of some defense attorneys. It is above a fast
food takeout place and next door to a souvenir shop that sells caps
honoring the police and fire departments. Police stood guard at the front
door while federal agents carted away files.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has been a defendant before. In 1999, she ended a decade-long
legal fight and pleaded guilty to second degree criminal contempt--a
misdemeanor--for refusing to tell a grand jury about the fee arrangements
of one of her clients in a drug case.</TE>
<TE>   The plea to the lesser charge, it turned out, allowed her to keep her
license to practice law.</TE>

crime, Amnesty International said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In its annual report on the death penalty, the human rights group said
at least 3,048 people were executed in 31 countries last year.</LD>
<LD>   That includes 2,468 executions in China. From April to July 2001,
China executed at least 1,781 people during its national "strike hard"
campaign against crime.</LD>
<TE>   Four countries--China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United States--were
responsible for 90% of the death sentences carried out in 2001, the group

<DH>Crime: Arizona convict freed on DNA tests is said to be the 100th
known condemned U.S. prisoner to be exonerated since executions resumed.</DH>

<LD>A former letter carrier who originally was sentenced to death for
the 1991 murder of a cocktail waitress in Phoenix has been exonerated by
DNA testing and freed from prison.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Krone, 44, walked out of prison in Yuma, Ariz., late Monday after
being incarcerated for a decade.</LD>
<LD>   Krone has always maintained his innocence, despite being convicted
twice of stabbing Kim Ancona to death on Dec. 29, 1991. Krone was
initially sentenced to death in 1992. That sentence was overturned in
1995, but he was convicted again the following year and sentenced to
life.</LD>
<TE>   Although Krone was no longer on death row, a bevy of capital
punishment foes--including Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), the American
Civil Liberties Union and the Justice Project--described Krone on Tuesday
as the 100th person in this country who had been sentenced to death but
eventually exonerated since executions resumed in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   For every seven people executed in the U.S. in the last quarter
century, one has been exonerated--an error rate that death penalty
critics say is unacceptably high.</TE>
<TE>   "Our nation this week reached an infamous milestone: 100 known--and
goodness only knows how many unknown--cases of people being sentenced to
death, since the reinstatement of capital punishment, for crimes they did
not commit," Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   "The time for denial is over. . . . Ray Krone lost 10 years of his
life while Arizona's women were endangered because the wrong man was in
jail," said Leahy, the chief sponsor of the Innocence Protection Act, a
package of death penalty reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "Justice has finally come," Krone said in a telephone interview
Tuesday. "The strength of knowing you are innocent" helped him get
through 10 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "And there was the strength I got from my friends and family. They
never doubted I was innocent. They did everything they could to help me
not get down."</TE>
<TE>   Krone said his cousin Jim Rix, a Lake Tahoe businessman whom he had
never met before his murder conviction, came to visit him in prison and
soon thereafter launched efforts that ultimately led to his exoneration.</TE>
<TE>   Krone, an Air Force veteran who was working as a letter carrier at the
time of his arrest, had no criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   But Phoenix police focused on him within hours after Ancona's naked,
blood-spattered body with 11 stab wounds was found in a bathroom of the
ABC Lounge on the morning of Dec. 29, when the bar owner went there for a
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Krone lived just a few blocks from the bar and his phone number was in
Ancona's address book. Another woman who worked at the bar testified that
Ancona told her that a man named "Ray" was coming late the night of Dec.
28 to help her close up.</TE>
<TE>   Krone said he was home that night. His roommate confirmed that Krone
had gone to bed about 10 p.m. but said he could not say for sure whether
Krone had gone out later.</TE>
<TE>   Krone frequently came to ABC Lounge to play darts. He testified that
he was acquainted with Ancona but did not know her well.</TE>
<TE>   A bite mark was found on the victim's left breast and on her neck.
Krone agreed to give police a dental impression by biting down on a
plastic foam cup. Because of an earlier accident, Krone had a distinct
bite pattern and a dentist helping police at the crime scene said Krone's
bite mark strongly resembled the one found on Ancona. Krone was later
referred to as the "snaggletooth killer."</TE>
<TE>   The bite mark was the critical evidence at the trial. There were no
fingerprints and there was no semen on Ancona, although there was
evidence she had been sexually assaulted. All the blood at the crime
scene was type O--the same type as Ancona and Krone and that of millions
of other Americans. No DNA testing was done.</TE>
<TE>   The key testimony in the case was presented by odontologist Ray
Rawson, who testified that Krone's bite mark matched the ones found on
the victim. A jury convicted Krone of murdering Ancona in 1992 but
acquitted him of sexual assault. A judge sentenced Krone to death, saying
that the murder had been committed in an especially "heinous or depraved
manner."</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Plourd, a San Diego attorney who specializes in cases
involving complicated forensics, filed an appeal. It contended that the
prosecutors had failed to turn over exculpatory evidence--a test done by
another forensic odontologist that concluded Krone's bite mark was not
consistent with the one found on the victim.</TE>
<TE>   The Arizona Supreme Court did not rule on that issue. Rather, in 1995,
the state's highest court reversed the conviction, saying that
prosecutors had failed to turn over critical information--a videotape on
the bite mark evidence prepared by Rawson that played a key role in the
trial--until right before the trial began.</TE>
<TE>   Krone was retried. Rawson testified for the prosecution again. Plourd
presented contradictory testimony from other bite mark specialists, but
Krone was convicted again in 1996. That time he got a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Krone's family hired another attorney, Alan M. Simpson
of Phoenix, to work with Plourd. They requested DNA tests using
sophisticated new technology. The initial tests conducted on saliva found
on the victim's tank top concluded that Krone could not have been the
source.</TE>
<TE>   Then, further tests were done, seeking to match the DNA found on the
tank top with material in a state database of convicted sex offenders.</TE>
<TE>   Those tests pointed strongly to Kenneth Phillips, 36, who already was
in prison in Florence, Ariz., convicted of attempted child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, an attorney for the Maricopa County attorney's office told
a judge in Phoenix that the odds were 1.3 quadrillion to 1 that the DNA
came from Phillips. In addition, prosecutors have found that Phillips,
like the victim, has type O blood and that a dental expert has said he
"cannot eliminate Phillips" as the person who left the bite mark,
according to William Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa County
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Alfred Frenzel released Krone,
subject to a hearing scheduled for April 29 after police and prosecutors
finish other testing. But Richard M. Romley, the Maricopa County
attorney, indicated that he strongly believes the wrong man was
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Modern technology that was not available at the time of Mr. Krone's
convictions has provided new scientific evidence, which raise a serious
question regarding Mr. Krone's guilt," Romley said.</TE>
<TE>   Krone, who was a proponent of the death penalty before he was sent to
prison, said he hopes his case will prompt people to reexamine the way
the criminal justice system operates.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the only one," Krone said. "To make a mistake is one thing.
It's another thing how you correct it afterward."</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 100 people on death row in Arizona, and a special
commission has been examining capital punishment there for more than a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 100 death penalty exonerations around the country, six came
from Arizona, according to a report by the Death Penalty Information
Center in Washington, D.C., a group that opposes the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   And of the 100 exonerations, 12 came as a result of DNA testing. The
Innocence Project at Cardozo Law School, co-founded by New York attorneys
Peter Neufeld and Barry Scheck, played a key role in numerous DNA
exonerations. Neufeld and Scheck said the Krone case showed both the
power of DNA testing and the faulty nature of bite mark evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Michael J. Saks, a professor at Arizona State University Law School,
who coauthored a book on forensic evidence, said bite mark testimony is
"classic junk science." He said a recent study by the American Board of
Forensic Odontologists found that 63.5% of bite mark analyses generated
"false positives" and that another 22% turned out to be false negatives.</TE>
<TE>   "At an absolute minimum," Saks said, "jurors should be informed of the
relative accuracy or inaccuracy of these tests so they don't think there
is more to them than there is."</TE>

<HD>Bush Seeks to Ease Rules for Older Volunteers</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRIDGEPORT, Conn.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush asked Congress Tuesday to make it easier and more
attractive for Americans to perform volunteer work, such as by lowering
the age of eligibility for the Senior Corps from 60 to 55 and allowing
participants to earn college money for other family members.</LD>
<LD>   Bush took to the road for the second day in a row to promote his USA
Freedom Corps initiative, which he outlined in his State of the Union
speech in January. On Monday, he touted the program in Tennessee. On his
trip to Connecticut on Tuesday, he also attended his 15th fund-raising
event of the year, raising $1.1 million for state Republicans in the
reelection campaigns of Reps. Nancy L. Johnson and Rob Simmons.</LD>
<LD>   The two are among a small number of House Republicans facing tough
races in November, and their fate will help determine whether the GOP
retains its control of the chamber.</LD>
<TE>   Bush extolled volunteerism in a speech after touring an urban
community center in Bridgeport. The center was created through a
partnership between the Corporation for National and Community
Service--the federal agency that administers most federally funded
volunteer programs--and an array of businesses and private organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In his fiscal 2003 budget, the president is seeking $290 million in
additional funding for the corporation's programs. He said the funds
would support 25,000 new participants in AmeriCorps, the national service
program created by President Clinton, and 100,000 more Senior Corps
volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's proposal, if approved by Congress, also would allow 300,000
students to repay their federal college loans through community service.</TE>
<TE>   And the president is proposing what he calls "silver" scholarships,
which would allow Senior Corps participants to earn a $4,700 college
scholarship they can donate to a family member. Bush also wants that
amount indexed to inflation.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes sense to have older Americans helping young Americans and,
at the same time, helping their families as well," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing his commitment to volunteerism, Bush said: "The great
American spirit has been tested in recent times, but history will record
that we met the test. One of the things I feel very passionate about is
our need to inspire the armies of compassion which exist in neighborhoods
all throughout America."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "Service and volunteerism are an integral part of the
American character."</TE>
<TE>   Bush repeated his call--first issued in the State of the Union
speech--for Americans to spend 4,000 hours during their lifetimes on
community service.</TE>

<HD>'His Leadership Has Fallen Short'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from Tuesday's statement by Police Commission President
Rick Caruso:</LD>
<LD>   The Police Commission made a commitment to the chief and this city
that the reappointment process would be fair, honest, thorough and guided
by the interests of this great city as a whole. We have listened
carefully and candidly to those passionately committed to making this
city better, from people living throughout Los Angeles with different
views and opinions.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Parks has done many noteworthy things as chief and during his
long career with LAPD. He has made the department more diverse. He has
launched the computerized crime response system known as FASTRAC. And
[he] has demanded a more disciplined department.</LD>
<TE>   In Chief Parks' record there are also areas where his actions do not
measure up, where his leadership has fallen short. Although his prior
evaluation noted the need for areas of improvement as a leader in dealing
with the commission, the need to be more flexible on his part in
considering alternative methods of addressing problems and acknowledging
that officer morale is his responsibility, we have seen no improvement.
Nor have we seen a measurable effort to give this commission confidence
that the chief will make a sincere commitment to change in these critical
areas.</TE>
<TE>   And although the chief should be complimented on instituting a
discipline system that demands respect for all residents, he has failed
to respond appropriately and quickly to revise the system to provide a
sense of fairness and equity in dealing with the officers. It is that
type of inflexibility and denial of a systemic problem within the
department that in part has caused poor morale and attrition of officers.</TE>
<TE>   Violent crime has continued to rise, while according to FBI
statistics, cities such as New York and Chicago are experiencing a drop
in violent crime.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in crime needs to be juxtaposed against another fact: LAPD is
1,100 officers short. As crime rises, LAPD's ability to fight crime is
diminished. LAPD statistics show that although crime is up, arrests are
down.</TE>
<TE>   The department is suffering a profound loss of confidence. Today the
Los Angeles Police Department is in crisis--a department losing officers
at an alarming rate while other neighboring police agencies such as the
L.A. County Sheriff's Department have increased the numbers of officers.
Veteran officers are abandoning the LAPD in record numbers as our academy
struggles to fill classes. Trust and confidence between those in uniform
and their chief has been mortally wounded.</TE>
<TE>   This department, similar to all organizations, needs a leader who is
demanding but fair, accepts responsibility and seeks solutions, who is
capable of energizing and motivating the men and women in the field, who
can communicate and relate to his subordinates. This organization is near
the point where it finds itself no longer having the capacity to perform
at its required potential.</TE>
<TE>   Today we continue moving forward. There will not be backsliding from
the reform and advances made to date. Today we begin a shared new chapter
in our city's history, not to turn back to old policies but to continue
moving forward to build a greater Los Angeles Police Department. As this
commission said at the outset when all of us started on this mission many
months ago, our task is to be fair and to truly look at the facts and to
reach a true and just decision, and this we have done.</TE>
<TE>   With regrets, the commission, by a vote of 4 to 1, must deny the
chief's request for a new five-year term.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks' press conference
Tuesday:</LD>
<LD>   Because of my commitment to this department and the communities of
this city, I have decided not to abandon my request for reappointment.</LD>
<LD>   I still have a lot to offer.</LD>
<TE>   My record and my accomplishments offer a compelling support for my
reappointment. There is still much to be done. We must improve the
working relationship inside and outside the department to instill pride
in that work while building the morale of this department. We must
continue the critical job of reform and continue to increase the public
confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department and we must strengthen
all of our community and governmental partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   I am disappointed the . . . Police Commission has decided not to
support my application to continue to serve. I did not have the
opportunity to put forward my plan for the future of this department in a
public forum. While I understand confidential personnel matters cannot be
discussed in public I do believe most of my presentation could have
easily been held in open session.</TE>
<TE>   Commission members said to you earlier that they arrived at their
decision by separating fact from fiction, by evaluating whether the
department is healthy under my leadership. I believe the facts are
crystal-clear. For the past five years I have worked tirelessly to fill
the leadership voids and correct the failings of the previous years.
While the commissioners claim they avoided political rhetoric, I
disagree. This process has become much too politicized.</TE>
<TE>   The police union clearly played a role in this process. Their campaign
of misinformation, of million-dollar TV ads and their powerful political
endorsements negatively influenced the process. And what most concerned
me is that the interest of the city residents has not been considered.</TE>
<TE>   I am also very disappointed that Mayor Jim Hahn decided to speak out
concerning his lack of support for my reappointment well before the
commission had an opportunity to adopt the criteria for which I was to be
judged.</TE>
<TE>   I am inflexible about corrupt officers, about officers who do not tell
the truth, about officers who do not treat the public correctly. I am
inflexible about that.</TE>

<HD>Chief Bernard C. Parks' LAPD Career</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chief Parks has served 37 years in the Los Angeles Police
Department. Here are some of the milestones in his career:</LD>
<LD>   February 1965: Enters police academy at LAPD. Works in traffic
division initially.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   August 1977: Is named a captain after stints as a sergeant and
detective.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   July 1980: Promoted to the rank of commander.</TE>
<TE>   February 1988: Named deputy chief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   June 1992: The Police Commission, haunted by the 1992 riots, appoints
outsider Willie L. Williams as police chief. Parks is the top contender
for the position from within the LAPD's ranks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   November 1992: Parks assumes the No. 2 spot as assistant chief.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   September 1994: Parks is demoted to deputy chief by Williams. He is
assigned to oversee LAPD's special operations, including the Internal
Affairs Division.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   August 1997: The choice of then-Mayor Richard Riordan, Parks is sworn
in as the 52nd chief of police of Los Angeles after Williams is not
reappointed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   December 1997: Parks revamps the department's system for disciplining
officers, resulting in more citizen complaints being investigated and
more officers censured or fired. Over time, many of the rank and file
come to view the new policies as overly burdensome.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   March 1998: Six pounds of cocaine is missing from a property room at
LAPD headquarters. In August, LAPD Officer Rafael A. Perez of the Rampart
Division is arrested on suspicion of stealing the cocaine. The Rampart
Division scandal involving allegedly violent, drug-dealing cops widens in
1999, and, under Parks' watch, is investigated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   1999: Chief Parks disbands the Senior Lead Officer program,
reassigning 170 senior leads from serving as full-time public liaisons to
patrol duties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mid-March 2000: Deputy district attorneys complain Parks has ordered
his detectives to deny them access to information regarding the unfolding
Rampart corruption investigation. Parks counters that, because the U.S.
attorney's office has joined the probe, the LAPD will send all
information to federal authorities instead of the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Late March 2000: After the chief accuses Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti of
going too slowly in prosecuting rogue officers and Garcetti accuses Parks
of obstructing his investigators, the Police Commission orders Chief
Parks to cooperate with the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   May 28, 2000: In a year when homicide rates rose sharply in the city,
Lori Gonzalez, Parks' granddaughter, is shot to death inside a car in the
driveway of a fast-food restaurant in southwest Los Angeles, one week
short of her 21st birthday. Police say the alleged gunman, a gang member,
was aiming for Gonzalez's companion, another gang member.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   March 5, 2001: A confidential report by the Police Commission's
inspector general finds that the LAPD sought to bypass county prosecutors
handling the Rampart corruption probe.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   March 13, 2001: Then-Mayor Richard Riordan orders the Senior Lead
Officer program reinstated. In a compromise, senior leads are to work at
least one day a week on street patrol.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 31, 2002: Parks announces he will seek another five-year term as
chief. The Los Angeles Police Commission, a group of five civilians
appointed by Mayor James K. Hahn, has until mid-May to decide whether to
reappoint Parks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 5, 2002: Mayor Hahn announces his opposition to a second
five-year term for Chief Parks, arguing that Parks has not done enough to
fight crime, reform the LAPD, or strengthen relations between police and
residents. African American community activists, religious leaders and
political officials react with anger and in mid-March, send a letter to
Hahn warning him he is no longer welcome in their "pulpits, at annual
dinners and other events."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 21, 2002: Police Commission President Rick Caruso announces Parks
will be evaulated on his vision and leadership; control and prevention of
crime; management; police reform; strategies for community policing and

<HD>Panel Swayed by Questions About Chief's Frankness and Honesty</HD>
<DH>Factors: Members say two key incidents weighed against Parks. He
disputes allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>City police commissioners who voted Tuesday to oust Los Angeles
Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said that in the end, questions about his
frankness and honesty in dealing with them came to be a key factor in
their lengthy deliberations.</LD>
<LD>   The commissioners, in an interview with The Times after the
announcement of their 4-1 vote, cited two incidents in particular that
weighed against the chief and which commission President Rick Caruso said
proved pivotal in his vote.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the incidents, Caruso said, Parks allegedly tried to derail
a new compressed work schedule for officers after the commission had
approved it. In the other, commissioners believed he misled them about
one of his job performance evaluations.</LD>
<TE>   Told of the commissioners' statements late Tuesday, Parks--sounding
frustrated and exasperated--sharply challenged the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is so relevant, why didn't it raise its ugly head during the
nine hours [in which the commission interviewed him]?" Parks said. "It's
amazing how things get interpreted."</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said one of the incidents dates back to last fall, and the
other arose in the midst of the commission's deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioners made their decision after a total of more than 21
hours in closed session, nine of them spent with the chief, and they
appeared emotional and exhausted at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso spoke of his concerns in the presence of three other
commissioners: David Cunningham, Rose Ochi, Silvia Saucedo. Cunningham
cast the lone vote in favor of Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Bert Boeckmann, the fifth commissioner, was not present and was not
available for comment after the news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The four sat wearily around the table where they had held hours of
arguments in closed sessions at a table covered with half-empty water
bottles and scrunched-up pieces of paper. The garbage was stacked high
with takeout boxes from restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said his admiration of the chief was first tarnished by the
incident involving the newly adopted compressed work schedule, a program
backed by Mayor James K. Hahn and the police union that allows officers
to work three 12-hour shifts a week. Parks had opposed the program, but
the commission approved it anyway.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Michael Cherkasky, the independent monitor assigned to
oversee the federal consent decree to reform the LAPD, contacted the city
asking if the new schedule would compromise court-ordered compliance with
the decree. Caruso said he had been told that a high-ranking LAPD
official had contacted Cherkasky.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said that he was stunned to discover that, because it seemed
that someone in the LAPD tried to stop the program after the commission
had approved it.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out, said commissioners Caruso and Ochi, that Parks was the
official who had contacted Cherkasky. Caruso said he saw that as an
attempt to sabotage the new work schedule behind commissioners' backs, by
using it to potentially jeopardize the city's legal position on the
consent decree.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners said Parks had been evasive when called to task about
the issue, although he eventually acknowledged talking to Cherkasky. "He
said, 'I make a lot of calls,' " Ochi recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Parks gave similar details about the incident Tuesday night, but a
different interpretation. He said the commissioners misread him.</TE>
<TE>   He said, for example, that he calls Cherkasky once a month to discuss
various issues, and that his subordinates call Cherkasky also. He said
that when commissioners questioned him, he really wasn't sure at first
which call they were referring to.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what I said," Parks commented Tuesday night. "I know what the
question was. If someone asked the same question today, I would answer
the same."</TE>
<TE>   But Caruso said, "It had come to our attention that there were efforts
on the part of the chief to circumvent or sabotage programs."</TE>
<TE>   The second incident involved a performance evaluation the chief had
submitted as part of his application for reappointment that commissioners
felt was misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the October incident had left him dubious, but when the
issue of the evaluation surfaced Monday, it convinced him not to support
the chief's bid.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been less than forthcoming," said Caruso in a Times interview
after the announcement. "It has raised an issue of character and
integrity in dealing with the commission."</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Commissioner Saucedo, leafing through the documents
provided to commissioners, found that they were missing Parks' 2001
performance evaluation and requested that he submit it this week.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said the chief presented the evaluation as evidence of his good
performance. But when Caruso checked into it, he discovered it had never
been approved by the full commission, and was in fact only a draft.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said he felt that was tantamount to being dishonest on a job
application, and said he was not satisfied with the chief's response. "I
had reason to question the documentation he relied upon. . . . It was
influential."</TE>
<TE>   Parks again objected strongly Tuesday night to the notion that he had
been at all dishonest, saying the evaluation had been signed by the
then-president of the panel, like others he had received, and he had no
way of knowing it had not been approved.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Cunningham supported the chief's view. "I feel the chief
was straightforward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Caruso said his vote was sealed by the evaluation issue. Saucedo
and Ochi were also influenced, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Caruso said, "I think the chief has a lack of respect for civilian
oversight of the department, which is the foundation of reform."</TE>
<TE>   Cunningham said, "I tried to look at what he had to offer the
department. His technical knowledge is extraordinary."</TE>

<HD>City Council Not Inclined to Save Chief</HD>
<DH>* Politics: Two-thirds vote could overrule Police Commission but
only three of the 15 say they favor doing so.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council has the power to overrule the Police
Commission's denial of a second term for Police Chief Bernard C. Parks,
but support for the chief among the council members is thin: Only the
group's three black representatives said Tuesday that they would favor
overturning the commission.</LD>
<LD>   In separate interviews, a majority of the 15-member council argued
instead for leaving the matter alone, a course that would remove Parks
from office no later than August, when the chief's five-year term ends.
Those council members said they did not believe it was their place to
second-guess the police panel, which voted 4 to 1 against reappointing
Parks.</LD>
<LD>   "Our initial impulse should always be to support the citizen system we
have set up," said Councilman Eric Garcetti. "Right now, I don't see a
will on the part of the council to assert jurisdiction and slap the
system in the face."</LD>
<TE>   Under the City Charter, the council has until April 19 to decide
whether to weigh in on the matter. Ten votes are needed to debate whether
to even consider overruling the commission. Then, 10 votes would be
needed to do so.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla said he had been discussing the matter
in recent days with his colleagues, and has found little interest among
the lawmakers to even delve into the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision of the Police Commission was based not only on
established performance standards, but on an evaluation of the management
and leadership of the chief," Padilla said. "The Police Commission has
done its job."</TE>
<TE>   Only council members Jan Perry, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Nate Holden
stepped forward to express strong, continued support for Parks'
reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unfortunate decision that needs to be reviewed by the
council," said Perry, adding that she will introduce a motion to have the
council review the commission action. "The chief has been a stabilizing
force for the department. For somebody who has a 37-year body of work
with the department including very recent excellent performance reviews,
you can't just cast him aside. That's not in the best interest of the
city."</TE>
<TE>   Holden said he felt betrayed by Mayor James K. Hahn, who pushed for
Parks' ouster despite the objections from many African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been a closed-door kangaroo hearing for the chief," said
Holden, who along with Ridley-Thomas and Perry are the only African
Americans on the council. "It really says a lot more than I knew about
Mayor Jimmy Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said Tuesday that the City Council has a right to decide whether
to debate the Police Commission's decision. The mayor said he would not
lobby for or against the council's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   A number of the council members said they were hoping the commission
decision would put an end to an ugly period of political bickering.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, it is my hope the decision today will lead us
down the path of depoliticizing this issue," said Councilman Jack Weiss.
"Because it hasn't been the decision that has been so agonizing for
people in this city, it has been the extent to which partisans on both
sides have politicized it."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Zine, a former LAPD sergeant and an outspoken
opponent of the chief's bid for another term, said he would support
letting the commission decision stand. "What this Police Department is
supposed to be doing is protecting the public," Zine said, "and yet crime
continues to increase, gang violence is increasing and we have the
embarrassment of the consent decree."</TE>
<TE>   Zine said he respects Parks for his long career but said he proved to
be too inflexible a chief and did not provide sufficient leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who chairs the Public Safety
Committee, said it appears the commission gave thorough consideration to
the chief's performance.</TE>
<TE>   "The council should only assert jurisdiction if it feels there is a
gross dereliction of duty [by the commission] or a gross mistake,"
Miscikowski said. "I didn't see it" in the commission statement. "I would
be unlikely to support asserting jurisdiction based on what I heard
today."</TE>
<TE>   Parks' term does not end until Aug. 12, and on Tuesday he vowed to
serve until the end. If the chief reconsiders and resigns before then,
the Police Commission would appoint an interim chief.</TE>
<TE>   The last time an interim chief oversaw the department was 1997, when
the commission selected Assistant Chief Bayan Lewis to head the LAPD
after it turned down Police Chief Willie L. Williams' request for a
second term.</TE>
<TE>   Williams agreed to leave his post early after getting a $375,000
severance package. That agreement resolved a $10-million claim that
Williams had filed against the city in connection with what he said was
the improper release of confidential personnel files.</TE>
<TE>   The council's handling of that matter was its second major foray into
dealing with the chief's status during Williams' tenure. The council
overruled the Police Commission when it tried to reprimand Williams for
lying about accepting free accommodations at a Las Vegas hotel. The
council action in that case prompted two commissioners to resign in
protest.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, some outside critics suggested that the council would be wise
to avoid a repeat of that battle. "I hope it will stay here, rather than
become a prolonged, bitter fight on the council, especially since there
doesn't seem to be the votes either way," said USC law professor Erwin
Chemerinksy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to find a way of healing the city and going forward," he
added. "This has just been so tragically divisive."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard C. Parks, for all his years with the LAPD, may not know who
William Crossman Warren was.</LD>
<LD>   But today of all days, he should.</LD>
<LD>   Will Warren was the only police chief in the history of Los Angeles to
be killed in the line of duty--shot by one of his own men.</LD>
<TE>   The spot on Spring Street where Will Warren was murdered on a
Halloween afternoon 130-odd years ago is two blocks away from where, on
Tuesday, the Police Commission pulled the trigger on Parks' career as Los
Angeles chief of police.</TE>
<TE>   As with the toppling of any public figure--and the words "political
assassination" will be coming soon to a microphone near you--the
whodunits and the whispering began before there was an actual body:</TE>
<TE>   The commission pulled the trigger. The mayor loaded the gun.
And--shades of Will Warren--the police union handed over the weapon, one
of those ankle-holster numbers kept on hand for unpleasant jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Curiously, that's exactly the image invoked by another chief of
police, Ed Davis, who admires Parks and is admired by him. I called Davis
up in Morro Bay to hear what he had to say about this.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it means the murder of a police chief by a murderous union.
They killed Willie Williams--I don't hold that against them--and now they
killed off Bernard Parks."</TE>
<TE>   On the civic stage outside Parker Center on Tuesday, the Police
Commission opened the envelope on its decision, padding the bad news with
mild, resume-quality adjectives to cocoon the blow: 4 to 1 against Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Theirs need not be the last word. Ten of the 15 City Council members
can overrule their four votes.</TE>
<TE>   An hour after the commission delivered its thumbs down, Chief Parks
descended the six floors from his office to stand at the same podium and
declare he would ask the council to do just that. Tonight, at the
historic African American fire station at Vernon and Normandie avenues,
residents will begin figuring how to lobby the council to keep Parks.</TE>
<TE>   But already people--the district attorney for one, and the
cop-turned-councilman Dennis Zine--have begun speaking of Chief Parks in
the past tense, a lame duck expected to clean out his desk by the close
of business four months and two days from today.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon hours, before the commission made its decision known,
Parker Center was aswarm with reporters and activists. Standing near the
monument to police officers killed in the line of duty was one of those
life-size angel figures--whatever size angels are. Around its right
biceps, someone had wrapped a black armband.</TE>
<TE>   A newcomer may wonder why L.A.'s politicians go unknown and ignored--a
county supervisor with more money and constituents than many U.S.
senators can't get recognized for a table at Lucques.</TE>
<TE>   But the police chief has the TVQ of a soap star. Into police matters,
Angelenos pour the passions that other cities expend on real politics.
Supervisors and council members kill programs and birth them, and change
life every day, but it was the Parks drama that got the TV trucks circled
like Conestoga wagons, breaking into a dozing afternoon's TV lineup with
the hot news. Hahn's press conference, overlapping with Parks', attracted
half as many cameras.</TE>
<TE>   There were rumors Tuesday of a citywide tactical police alert, that
there was so much fervor for Parks that people would protest or even riot
to keep him. Who can imagine anyone rioting for Jim Hahn?</TE>
<TE>   Why is this so?</TE>
<TE>   The media image, sure, has been carefully pruned and groomed from
"Dragnet" on the radio to "Adam 12" on TV. But the real chiefs have
buckled a few swashes: Jim "Two Gun" Davis sent L.A. cops to the Arizona
border on a "Bum Blockade" during the Depression. Ed Davis famously
suggested hanging hijackers at the airport on a portable gallows. The
august Bill Parker, the choleric Daryl Gates, the Vegas-loving Willie
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Davis thinks it's the life-or-death nature of policing, the
historical high profile of any chief--by nature part lawman, part
showman. It was Davis who was asked whether he'd run for mayor and
memorably replied, "Why give up all this power?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis put that perspective to Tuesday's events. Parks, he said, is "a
great professional." As for Hahn--"Well, he's only a mayor. He's not a
police chief."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Dallas Mayor a Senate Nominee</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ron Kirk wins a Democratic runoff for the seat being
vacated by the GOP's Phil Gramm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS
</DL>
<LD>Former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk became Texas' first black nominee for
U.S. Senate by trouncing Victor Morales in Tuesday's Democratic runoff
for the seat of retiring Republican Sen. Phil Gramm.</LD>
<LD>   The victory sets up the so-called "Dream Team" for Democrats who hope
to use Kirk and Latino gubernatorial candidate Tony Sanchez to energize
their base among minorities in the traditionally conservative state.</LD>
<LD>   With 93% of precincts reporting, Kirk had 333,036 votes, or 58%, and
Morales had 238,281 votes, or 42%.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel great, absolutely relieved and exhausted," Kirk said.</TE>
<TE>   Texas has never had a senator from a minority group.</TE>
<TE>   But Kirk faces a grueling battle against Atty. Gen. John Cornyn, who
has President Bush's backing, a deep war chest and the advantage of being
a Republican in a state where the GOP holds every statewide office.</TE>
<TE>   Because Democrats hold a one-seat edge in the Senate, every close race
this year is potentially pivotal.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk said he planned to run a "positive campaign" against Cornyn,
though he didn't expect the same from the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Through a spokesman, Cornyn said he was looking forward to "a vigorous
and civil debate on the issues" this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk, the first black mayor of Dallas and a former secretary of state,
was the polished party favorite. But in a recent poll, he had trailed
Morales, an underfunded, pickup-driving Mexican American schoolteacher
who offered himself as a representative of the average Texan. Morales was
the party nominee in 1996 and lost to Gramm.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout was projected to be about 6% of the state's 12.2 million
registered voters, consistent with similar runoffs over the last decade.
Analysts had expected black and Latino voting strengths to even out,
leaving white voters to tip the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Regional results showed Kirk won more than a third of the vote in
south Texas, where Morales expected to fare best. Kirk led everywhere
else except in West Texas.</TE>
<TE>   At a restaurant in Austin, Morales refused to immediately concede and
said he wouldn't endorse Kirk. He then took a swipe at Kirk's backers: "I
thoroughly, completely distrust the Democratic Party leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Bickering over qualifications and upbringing overshadowed the issues
in the runoff, with Kirk painting Morales as an unqualified opportunist,
and Morales accusing his lawyer opponent of being out of touch with poor
Texans.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk, also a former lobbyist, was handpicked by Democratic leaders to
round out a diverse statewide ticket dubbed the "Dream Team."</TE>
<TE>   Party leaders believed Kirk's nomination would bring national
attention and money to the race against Cornyn, while Morales' part-time
campaign would be grossly overmatched by the GOP nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk, who was little known outside Dallas before he began his run, won
endorsements from party leaders as he touted his bipartisan,
bridge-building record at Dallas City Hall throughout the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But Morales gathered popular appeal by pushing his underdog image and
his ability to relate to average folks. It echoed his 1996 campaign
during which he reached celebrity status by crisscrossing the state in
his truck in a long-shot bid to unseat Gramm.</TE>

Michael Burgess in a GOP runoff for the seat his father, House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, is giving up for retirement.</TE>

<HD>Campaign Funding Battle Rages Anew Over House Bill</HD>
<DH>Policy: Amid fears that nonprofit groups will be a conduit for
unrestricted donations, legislation seeks to ease oversight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>In a postscript to the recent congressional debate on campaign
finance reform, a sharp battle broke out in the House on Tuesday over
legislation to ease financial reporting requirements for a range of
nonprofit groups active in politics.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute followed release of a study earlier in the day that found
that 25 nonprofits, spanning the political spectrum, have quietly raised
more than $67 million in less than two years to influence elections for
federal offices.</LD>
<LD>   Such money-raising prowess by outside groups has gained attention
since the enactment last month of strict fund-raising limits on national
political parties that will take effect later this year.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the House is scheduled to vote on a proposal backed by
Republican leaders that would exempt some of the politically active
nonprofit groups from requirements that they detail their contributions
and spending to the Internal Revenue Service.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP leaders, in Tuesday's heated exchange, said the exempted
groups would still be required to disclose their financial backers to
state authorities.</TE>
<TE>   For many of the state and local groups that are not active in national
politics, the IRS reporting requirement is a burden that merely produces
"mounds and mounds of useless paper," said Rep. David Vitter (R-La.).</TE>
<TE>   But critics denounced the measure as a potential conduit to allow
unlimited donations known as soft money into the political system without
effective public scrutiny. The newly enacted law prohibits national
parties and candidates for federal office from raising or spending such
money after next fall's congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show you that you can deadbolt the front door, but
reform opponents will always try to sneak their money in the back
window," said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), an opponent of the measure.</TE>
<TE>   The provision is part of an otherwise noncontroversial bill to grant
taxpayers certain safeguards against excessive penalties and to extend by
15 days--until April 30--the deadline for taxpayers who file electronic
returns.</TE>
<TE>   Today's vote could be close, because Republican leaders are using
parliamentary procedures that require a two-thirds majority for passage
of the bill, wanting to act quickly as the April 15 tax deadline
approaches. But that means significant opposition from Democrats over the
exemption provision would sink the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Ways
and Means Committee, signaled that his party was ready to do just that to
thwart the exemption provision.</TE>
<TE>   Also opposing the provision is Rep. Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.), a
co-sponsor of the just-enacted campaign law. "We shouldn't be taking
steps backward after taking major steps forward."</TE>
<TE>   Republican leaders said that if Democrats chose to defeat the entire
bill over the exemption provision, they would have to live with the
political consequences. "Let them make their vote and go ahead and
explain it to the people," House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas)
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The new twist in the campaign finance debate brought a spotlight to
groups that in recent years have flexed their political muscles in ways
that have drawn little public notice.</TE>
<TE>   The study released Tuesday by Public Citizen, titled "Deja Vu Soft
Money," concluded that these independent groups, tax-exempt under Section
527 of the tax code, appear well-positioned to do what will soon be
forbidden for the national parties: raising and spending soft money.</TE>
<TE>   The study was the first comprehensive look at the political activities
of the so-called 527 groups since they were required by law two years ago
to disclose their political contributions and expenditures.</TE>
<TE>   The new campaign law, said Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook,
"will be undermined if this river of [soft] money is simply diverted to
shadowy and highly partisan [nonprofit] groups."</TE>
<TE>   Public Citizen, founded by Ralph Nader 30 years ago, is a watchdog
group based in Washington that generally advocates liberal or
consumer-oriented government reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $67.3 million collected by the 25 most active 527 political
groups during the second half of 2000 and in 2001, the report found that
most of the money went to highly partisan or ideological groups. The
largest, Pro Choice Vote, collected $12.3 million, most of it from
actress Jane Fonda, to support abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a
labor union that actively supports Democrats, was the second-largest
collector, with $9.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   A group called the Republican Leadership Council collected $3.9
million, and the Club for Growth, a conservative anti-tax group,
collected $2.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The report found that the money the 25 groups raised was comparable to
what some national party committees were raising and spending to elect
congressional candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The new campaign law will prohibit certain political advertisements by
the nonprofits and other groups during the weeks close to an election.
But other political activities will still be allowed.</TE>

<HD>Team Hailed, Then It's Farewell</HD>
<DH>Competition: Moorpark Academic Decathlon squad gets a royal
send-off as it heads for the nationals in Phoenix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere between the standing ovations and the limousine ride,
members of Moorpark High School's Academic Decathlon team looked at
each other in confusion.</LD>
<LD>   Could all this fanfare really be for us?</LD>
<LD>   At the rally in the high school stadium Tuesday morning,
supporters said they couldn't do enough for the hard-working Moorpark
team, which will represent California in the U.S. Academic Decathlon,
which starts today in Phoenix.</LD>
<TE>   "These students represent the very best of Moorpark--they work
hard, they are humble, smart and they are cool," Moorpark Unified
School District Supt. Frank DePasquale told the crowd of 2,300
cheering students. "No matter what happens in Phoenix, I guarantee
you this team will come home to a hero's welcome."</TE>
<TE>   Student body President Albert Hwu and a crew of helpers were at
school before 7 a.m. Tuesday putting up hand-painted posters, hanging
green-and-yellow streamers and creating an arch of balloons for the
team to sit under.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that the task was assigned by Principal Anna
Merriman, who also arranged for a sleek, white stretch limo to take
the students and their coaches to the airport afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Albert said he and fellow students genuinely wanted to wish
the team well. "This is big," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For the decathletes, a win in Phoenix this weekend would be big in
several ways.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the second time that Moorpark High--the small town's
only high school--took the national title in four years. The first
was in 1999, when most of the current team members were freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   It could also mark the end of a storied coaching career for
teacher Larry Jones, who has said he may retire from "acadeca" after
this year because of sheer exhaustion.</TE>
<TE>   He quit once before, after the 1999 championship, in part because
he believed the U.S. Academic Decathlon organization was turning the
competition into a canned event that did not promote critical
thinking. But he returned to coach Moorpark to a second-place finish
in the 2001 state decathlon.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the team has a significant handicap this year, Jones said,
because students are scheduled to compete first in interviews, one of
the key events.</TE>
<TE>   It's widely known that going first means lower scores, Jones said,
and it could cost the team up to 1,000 points (last year's national
champ, El Camino Real High of Woodland Hills, scored 46,547 but won
by a mere 21 points). But Jones said his students have tried to make
up for it, having spent at least 12 hours a day cramming during
spring break.</TE>
<TE>   "A year ago I started selecting this team, and back then I knew
these nine were something special," Jones said at the rally. "They've
given this thing everything they have."</TE>
<TE>   This year's Academic Decathlon, themed "Understanding Others,"
will test high school students in seven subjects, with topics ranging
from Shakespeare's sonnets to statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-five teams from 38 states will compete today through Friday
in Phoenix, with the winner to be announced at a banquet Saturday
evening.</TE>
<TE>   At nationals, the toughest competition for California teams
typically comes from Illinois and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But the nine teenagers from Moorpark said they won't sweat the
competition and instead will focus on the task at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "We're ready," said team captain Dean Reich.</TE>
<TE>   Since last fall, he and teammates Julie Bristol, Nathaniel Jones,
Michelle Kim, Johnny Mendoza, Sheena Sidhu, Andy Song, Sergio Suarez
and Jerome Yang have spent hundreds of hours poring through study
materials, reciting speeches, writing essays and taking practice
quizzes.</TE>
<TE>   The rigorous study schedule has left virtually no time for social
events, and they have missed vacations and given up sports.</TE>
<TE>   "For a while I was thinking I would be bummed not to have a spring
break my senior year," Bristol said. "But then my friends reminded
me, this is a once-in-a-lifetime experience."</TE>
<TE>   If anyone can attest to the students' dedication, it's their
parents, who say they have hardly seen their children in the last
several days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a harried week between studying and trying to pack for
the trip," said Sergio's mother, Juanita Suarez. "Like all the kids,
he's up past midnight every night and up early in the morning.
They're like shadows."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Interior Department employees used government-issued credit cards
to pay their rent, withdraw money at casinos and buy jewelry and
furniture, an audit found.</LD>
<LD>   Almost three-quarters of the department's 79,000 workers have
government credit cards, and the agency's inspector general found
problems with use and oversight.</LD>
<LD>   "The department and its bureaus do not have sufficient controls in
place to minimize abuse of the charge card," the report said.</LD>
<TE>   Interior spokesman John Wright said Tuesday the department is working
to solve the problems identified in the audit, which was completed in
late December.</TE>
<TE>   Employees with government-issued cards made more than 2 million
purchases for $675 million in fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Employees were
not named and the report did not say whether they repaid the government
or were disciplined.</TE>
<TE>   The audit was completed a year after the Clinton administration gave
the department an award for good management of its credit card system.</TE>

<HD>Fish Reduces Sudden Heart Death, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two new studies show people who eat substantial amounts of oily fish
are greatly protected from sudden, unexpected death, a common
condition usually caused by severely abnormal heart rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   The studies--which both draw their conclusions from long-term
observation of tens of thousands of people--greatly bolster the
evidence that eating fish regularly can have major health benefits.
While most of earlier studies focused on men, one of the new studies
demonstrates fish's benefit in women.</LD>
<LD>   The benefit for men and women appears to come mostly from fish's
effect on the risk of sudden cardiac death, although in the study
involving women fish protected against nonfatal heart attacks too.</LD>
<TE>   Each year, about 220,000 Americans experience sudden death,
collapsing and dying within an hour, often before they get to a
hospital. In most cases, an abnormal heart rhythm arising from
existing heart disease is believed to be the cause.</TE>
<TE>   ''Prevention is really the only way to impact the rate and
mortality from sudden death,'' said Christine Albert, a cardiologist
at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who headed one of the
studies. ''One way you could do it in a population that's healthy is
through diet and lifestyle.''</TE>
<TE>   In one study, which appears in today's Journal of the American
Medical Assn., a team led by JoAnn Manson, also a physician at
Brigham and Women's Hospital, studied the experience of 85,000 women
nurses as part of the Nurses' Health Study, which began in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found the more frequently a woman ate fish, the
less likely she was to suffer a heart attack or die of any cardiac
cause. Specifically, those who ate fish once a week had a 30% lower
risk of heart attack or death compared to those who never ate fish.</TE>
<TE>   In the other study, to be published in Thursday's New England
Journal of Medicine, Albert and her colleagues looked at the
experience of 22,000 male doctors who enrolled in the Physicians'
Health Study in 1982. They were all free of heart disease at the
time, and 15,000 also volunteered a blood sample.</TE>
<TE>   In 17 years, 94 of the men who had given blood samples and who
hadn't subsequently been diagnosed with heart disease died suddenly.
The researchers chose about 180 surviving members of the study and
compared them to those victims. In particular, they compared the
bloodstream concentrations of substances called n-3 fatty acids,
found primarily in fish oils.</TE>
<TE>   On average, the men who died had lower amounts of n-3 fatty acids
than the ones who hadn't died suddenly. When researchers divided all
the men into four groups based on the concentration of n-3 fatty
acids in the blood, the men in the highest quarter had only one-fifth
the risk of sudden death as those in the lowest quarter.</TE>
