<LD>RESCUING THE WORLD</LD>
<LD>   The Life and Times of Leo Cherne</LD>
<LD>   By Andrew F. Smith</LD>
<TE>   Foreword by Henry A. Kissinger</TE>
<TE>   State University of New York Press</TE>
<TE>   256 pp., $26.50</TE>
<TE>   Two years before he died in 1999 at the age of 88, Leo Cherne told
a friend he wanted to be "remembered as a cold warrior." He probably
will be.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew F. Smith's pedestrian biography of him, "Rescuing the
World," stresses Cherne's tireless work on behalf of refugees in the
world, beginning with Europe after World War II and continuing into
Indochina and Africa. For 40 years Cherne was head of the
International Rescue Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But, as Smith writes, anti-Communism was the consuming force that
drove Cherne's refugee work: "For Cherne, refugees were a political
weapon. As he believed that the Soviet Union and Communism were the
greatest post-World War II threat, he was more concerned with helping
refugees who were escaping from the Communist countries."</TE>
<TE>   Cherne came by his political activism naturally enough. He was
born Leopold Chernetsky in the Bronx to radical socialists who had,
like so many Russian Jews, emigrated from Russia to escape the
pogroms and to find a better life.</TE>
<TE>   In high school he joined a gang, attended the Metropolitan Opera
with his parents, got a job as a merchant seaman on ships to Puerto
Rico and, as a junior in high school, successfully organized a fund
to help the victims of a hurricane in Puerto Rico.</TE>
<TE>   From 16 to 21 Cherne belonged to a youth organization of B'nai
B'rith, where he specialized in giving strong political speeches
against fascism. He attended New York University and its law school
and, in the 1930s, got into advising businesses on how to cope with
New Deal law and, later, on business law and regulations during World
War II.</TE>
<TE>   To this end he founded the Research Institute, which quickly
flourished with many clients and 350 employees. Here Cherne developed
the pattern of action for which he became noted, the cultivation of a
wide circle of influential friends in business and government.</TE>
<TE>   Cherne got into the refugee rescuing business in the early 1950s
as the Cold War stepped up and refugees fleeing East Germany began
streaming into the West. He succeeded the ailing Protestant
theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as chairman of the International Refugee
Committee and soon secured some generous financing from the Ford
Foundation and others.</TE>
<TE>   It was the aborted Hungarian Revolution in 1956 that thrust Cherne
into the limelight and set him on the cold warrior course of which he
was so proud. With a friend he made his way into contested Budapest
and returned to appear on "The Ed Sullivan Show" talking about the
suppression of Hungarian rebels by the Soviet Red Army.</TE>
<TE>   As anti-communism became his consuming cause, he campaigned among
influential Americans for Ngo Dinh Diem as a reliably anti-Communist
leader of South Vietnam. Later, as a member of the Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board he had a hand in the creation, at the end
of the Ford administration, of the famous "Plan B," a right-wing
assessment by experts outside the government of the Soviet Union's
intentions and power (it was dramatically more pessimistic than the
government's assessment).</TE>
<TE>   A longtime Democrat, Cherne, believing the Democrats were soft
toward Moscow, became a Republican when Ronald Reagan was president.
He cherished the Medal of Freedom that Reagan gave him, as he did his
medal from the CIA for distinguished service.</TE>
<TE>   One of the flaws of "Rescuing the World" is that Smith, defensive
of his subject, does not explore in detail Cherne's relationship with
the CIA, although he does say that Cherne met with CIA personnel from
time to time and "mentored" them in economic analysis. Smith notes
that the refugee committee once received $50,000 from the CIA for
some resettlement work.</TE>
<TE>   The greater flaw is that Smith's plodding prose does not bring
Cherne to life. Smith notes, mysteriously, that he did not go into
Cherne's personal life. He does discuss, at some length, Cherne's
modest success as an amateur sculptor, creating busts of Lincoln and
other famous statesmen.</TE>
<TE>   But what remains, in "Rescuing the World," is an indistinct sketch
of an ardent old cold warrior whom, by his death, time had passed by.</TE>

<HD>Tips for Indulging Your Purple Passion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA DANE ROGERS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a passion for purple going around. From sweaters and suede on
fashion runways to PT Cruisers on city streets, the color is having
its 15 minutes of fame.</LD>
<LD>   One sure-fire sign of its current cachet: purple M&amp;Ms. In a global
vote conducted by candy maker Mars, 10 million people in 200
countries picked purple over pink and aqua as the latest new
melt-in-your-mouth color.</LD>
<LD>   "Purple is one of my favorite colors. It goes with almost
everything," says Washington, D.C., interior designer Jose Solis
Betancourt.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand:</TE>
<TE>   "With certain shades of purple, you run the risk of looking
cheap," says Sarah Wessell, a Washington designer with a Georgetown
shop.</TE>
<TE>   Like other assertive new colors that flash in the pan--think of
lime green a few years ago and the more recent bright orange--a shot
of purple can inject instant energy into a wardrobe or a room.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a downside: When the trend runs its course, you're
stuck with it. And while a purple necktie or scarf can be easily
ditched, how will you feel about a Barney-colored Barcalounger?</TE>
<TE>   "There are pitfalls with any trend," advises West Coast color guru
Leatrice Eiseman, former director of the Pantone Color Institute.
"But if you are comfortable with the color, go for it."</TE>
<TE>   Purple is a complex color, a blend of red and blue that ranges
from the palest pinks to the inkiest blues. Color professionals think
of true purple as an equal mixture of the two, but changing these
proportions also changes its personality. "You say 'purple' and most
people think of vivid royal purple. But within the purple family, the
color range is huge," says Jay de Sibour, president of the
Alexandria, Va.-based Color Marketing Group, a trade association that
forecasts color trends for manufacturers. "Some shift in hue
depending on the light. You might fall in love with a rich, dark
purple, but if it's other than midday, you'd swear that it's black."</TE>
<TE>   If you're ready to take a purple plunge, design pros have some
tips for bringing either a lot or a little of the color into your
home.</TE>
<TE>   "If you love a color, really use it. Don't just limit yourself to
purple accents," says Washington designer David H. Mitchell. "If you
have a great sofa, cover it with purple. If you hate it five years
down the road, you can change it."</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell says rich, heavy fabrics do wonders for purple. "You need
a fiber that captures the saturation of the color. It's beautiful
with velvets, silks or wools." A purple dining room would be a
delightful alternative to the ubiquitous red, he says. "Dark, dark
purple walls in Benjamin Moore's Exotic Purple (No. 2071-10) would be
fabulous with pale pink cashmere curtains." For a slightly lighter
shade, he suggests Benjamin Moore Misty Lilac (No. 2071-70).</TE>
<TE>   Purple also profits from a touch of silver, Mitchell says. Silvery
throw pillows and a gray rug with stylized purple flowers would be
terrific with that sofa.</TE>
<TE>   Eiseman echoes Mitchell's call for gray and silver but also likes
deep blues and champagne beiges with quiet purple. To keep that
soothing feeling, she suggests using the same low-key intensity for
all the colors in the room.</TE>
<TE>   "Think elderberry, aubergine and smoky casts of purple," says
Eiseman--Calvin Klein bedding as opposed to Welch's grape juice. "The
new purples are restful and beautiful, with blue undertones as
opposed to red," she says. "Soothing purples seem appropriate. The
softness relates well to these times. Basically, they function just
like neutrals."</TE>
<TE>   Bluish purples are well suited for bedrooms and dining rooms, she
says. In hot climates and rooms facing south, they can make a room
seem cooler.</TE>
<TE>   Solis Betancourt also likes purple for bedrooms. In a guest room
in his home, he showed how purple can take on a rainbow of color
companions: a warm lavender for the walls, a pale aqua coverlet for
the bed and a red chair.</TE>
<TE>   "Color is about emotion, and home is all about expressing who you
are," says Eiseman. "If you don't know why you love a color, then you
need to try it out. If you have serious doubts, pay attention. And if
you still love it, then it deserves to be taken home."</TE>

<LD>Bulbs begin arriving at nurseries now. The first to go in the ground
should be the fall-flowering kinds, including colchicum, saffron and
autumn crocus. Others you can buy while the selection is great, then
plant in October or even November. Tulips and hyacinths need to be
refrigerated for at least six weeks. Buy them now and put the bags in
the vegetable crisper of your refrigerator until December.</LD>
<LD>   Plant chrysanthemums, available in 4-inch pots, for fall color.
When they have finished in late November or December, plant spring
colors in their places. The small-flowered bedding chrysanthemums,
which come in autumnal hues, are the best bet.</LD>
<LD>   If you act now, you can have bedding plants in bloom by
Thanksgiving or the December holidays. Several will survive this
month's heat waves and flower well ahead of the normal spring bloom,
including calendula, Iceland poppy, pansy and stock.</LD>

<LD>Louise Guy cocks her head as she examines her painting.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone says the green is too bold, but I like it," she says.</LD>
<LD>   The watercolor work, of an exotic Hawaiian orchid, is a
commission, so she's anxious to make sure it's just right.</LD>
<TE>   Guy touches up the leaf during her regular Thursday morning
painting class at Edgehill Lifecare Community in Stamford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   The class, taught for two years by Harriet Lacker, has become
wildly successful. At the students' art show last year, which was
strictly for display, their works were so popular that people begged
to buy them. "At first, we said they weren't for sale," says Tina
Marshall, activities director at Edgehill, "but then we thought, 'why
not?' "</TE>
<TE>   After the show, the students' success picked up momentum. Guy, an
alumna of Kappa Kappa Gamma, designed a greeting card that the
sorority will sell to raise money. Resident Grace Zoephel painted a
floral work that Edgehill turned into a set of 12 boxed note cards to
benefit a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   A businesswoman with no formal art training, Guy started taking
classes with Lacker two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the kind of person who likes to learn," she says. "We started
with calligraphy and I said, 'What else have you got?' Now we do
watercolors and collage."</TE>
<TE>   Lacker has been impressed with her students' progress.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has come a long way," she says of the students, who
number about a dozen. "They're not so tentative; they're bold and
trying new things."</TE>
<TE>   Another member of the class, Gaetana Ricci, says: "I was away for
a couple of weeks and then I came back and I thought, 'Wow, we've
improved.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lacker flits from one to another. "Ingrid! I'm glad you didn't
give up on those poppies," she says to Ingrid Sladkus, who replies:
"It's a commission. That's why I'm so uptight."</TE>
<TE>   The lessons keep the residents stimulated, says Lacker, who was an
art teacher in the Stamford elementary schools for many years and
also teaches art to seniors with limitations. Often, she'll bring in
her own painting to demonstrate a particular technique.</TE>
<TE>   Of Guy, Lacker says: "You know what I call her? Fearless. She's
totally ready to try anything."</TE>
<TE>   "I find it very rewarding to be 93 years old and have something to
look forward to every Thursday," Guy says.</TE>
<TE>   "People get excited about what they're doing," Lacker says.
"They'll work in between [the Thursday classes]," she says. "They put
[their work] in their apartment, and every time they walk by they're
self-critiquing."</TE>
<TE>   Guy's apartment is filled with her colorful artwork--bright
florals and witty collages. Her daughter, an artist, brings her color
photocopies of interesting images from catalogs, magazines and art
books. Guy laboriously cuts them and creates collages. In a collage
of yellow and red poppies, "You see shoes and gloves and umbrellas
and all sorts of things. That's what makes it fun."</TE>
<TE>   Lacker's students have also done painting on glass and other
crafts, and they painted the mural on the art room wall at Edgehill.
Besides the Thursday morning class, Lacker sometimes teaches again in
the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "I teach to the individual painting," says Lacker, who says the
women start with photographs or just an idea in their imagination. "I
tell them, 'Don't give up on it, you'll work it through.' "</TE>
<TE>   Besides the painting, Guy's latest interest is card making.
Throughout the year, she maintained a pen pal relationship with a
5-year-old schoolgirl. Recently, she presented the girl with a pop-up
card.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall, who is Guy's daughter, says, "I call her our own Grandma
Moses."</TE>
<TE>   "The main thing when you're my age is, you have to stay busy or
you start to feel sorry for yourself," says Guy before heading off to
her afternoon art class.</TE>

<HD>Withdrawing Into Our Cells</HD>
<DH>Rampant use of mobile phones is affecting how we
communicate--and fail to--in our private and public lives</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Wireless technology has made it easier than ever to learn more about
a perfect stranger's life. The task isn't accomplished through
computer wizardry or high-tech listening devices. It's nothing
illegal, nothing inappropriate--at least on your part. Nope. All you
have to do is to walk around in the 21st century in any
industrialized nation in the world and listen for "cell yell."</LD>
<LD>   The condition afflicts cell phone users and can strike anywhere,
any time, but mostly seems to overcome people in crowded public
places such as restaurants, public transport and even the workplace.
Under its sway, the caller will speak in a voice at twice, maybe
triple, the volume of a normal conversation. And the things they talk
about! Bounced checks, strange rashes, lovers' spats.</LD>
<LD>   Cell yell is just one of the many unanticipated consequences of a
cell phone planet. Its massive electronic tentacles are influencing
more than just our relationship with others, though it is doing
precisely that, but it's also changing our personal behavior in broad
and subtle ways never envisioned.</LD>
<TE>   And more than anything, we are discovering just how far and wide
mind and body can be separated--because now we can be where we
aren't, no matter where we are.</TE>
<TE>   "What it's done is to change our view of reality," asserts John
Petersen, founder and president of the Arlington Institute, a
future-oriented think thank in Arlington, Va. "You remember not so
long ago when making a long-distance phone call was a big deal? You'd
say, 'I'm calling long distance,' and you were supposed to drop
everything? Now it's not a big deal anymore to get a call from
anywhere on the globe."</TE>
<TE>   More change is certainly on the way. Within five years, futurists
predict cell phones will continue to shrink in size but expand in
capability. The hand-held device will not only be able to make phone
calls but will also function as a computer and perhaps even as a
television. From there, they say, who knows--but don't rule out the
possibility of a communications chip implanted in the body.</TE>
<TE>   But even now the world is a much smaller place because of the
ubiquity of the cell phone. In the United States, among the slowest
of the industrialized nations to adopt the cell phone, nearly two in
three, or about 137 million, people use the device.</TE>
<TE>   Little more than a decade ago, market studies by
telecommunications companies indicated that, at best, cell phone
users in America would top out at 3 million, according to Michael
Zey, a sociologist at Montclair State University in New Jersey. At
first, people claimed to value their privacy too much to have it
interrupted without warning by a cell phone, according to Zey.</TE>
<TE>   "Focus groups said, 'I would never accept a cell phone in my car
because it's one of the few private places where the boss, my spouse,
my kids can't reach me,' " Zey said. "Well, that changed."</TE>
<TE>   In the workplace, cell phones are the latest tech tool to blur the
line between office and home. The cell phone--some call it an
electronic leash--has made it easier than ever for a boss to reach a
worker any time, anywhere with the tacit understanding that there are
few viable excuses for missing the call.</TE>
<TE>   The cell phone even eliminated the few precious minutes of mental
preparation time provided by its predecessor, the pager. Now, when
the cell phone rings, the worker has only seconds to collect his or
her thoughts and recognize the caller, then answer. The result is
that many workers feel pressure to be on call 24/7.</TE>
<TE>   "The expectation because of this technology is: Now I have to know
what my boss is thinking before I get to work," Zey said. "The
workday never ends."</TE>
<TE>   Cell phone users can also face stiff challenges in focusing on the
conversation. On a land line, callers are usually in familiar
surroundings and thus less distracted by their environment and can
more easily concentrate. With a cell phone, however, caller and
receiver can easily miss an important detail as they multitask their
way through traffic, a grocery store or the disapproving stares of
fellow restaurant patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving even more room for miscommunication are newer cell phones
with the capability of sending and receiving e-mails. "We always had
bosses who had difficulty writing a memo," Zey said. "Well, multiply
that by 1,000 times."</TE>
<TE>   In the workplace, cell phones have created other unexpected
problems among co-workers, especially in offices with closely spaced
desks and cubicles.</TE>
<TE>   For some workers, the office phone isn't enough--they need a
private, personal line. Thus cell phones have begun creeping into the
workplace, and there's no doubt the calls aren't all business or even
for legitimate personal business.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main reasons it gets under people's skin is that when
people talk on a cell phone, it's as if everyone around them ceases
to exist, and that's very insulting," said Carol Page, a Boston
public relations consultant and founder of CellManners.com. "Also, I
think people just can't stand to overhear inane personal
conversations."</TE>
<TE>   As some cities and states have banned cell phone use in cars and
restaurants, some are talking about similar restrictions in the
workplace. With the annoying rings, loud conversations and the fact
that the worker is usually sitting by an office phone, it may not be
long until cell phone users join smokers outside--where the reception
would be better anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Page, whose Web site promotes civility between cell phone users
and those around them, said banning cell phones at work isn't
necessary. Workers should put their phones on vibrate and take
personal calls away from their desks if they are within earshot of
others.</TE>
<TE>   Cell phones are also reshaping our social habits and attitudes,
say sociologists. The portable phones, depending on their usage, can
by turns be a shield against loneliness or create isolation. At one
end of a restaurant, a patron dining alone places his or her order,
then dials a friend--alone but not alone. At the other end of the
restaurant, a cell phone conversation interrupts a face-to-face
dinner conversation--leaving one party dining alone.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see similar dynamics at parties. On the one hand, a
cell phone can help make a party all the merrier by easily summoning
other partyers to the scene. On the other, a cell phone can
discourage users from reaching out to other party guests. Where once
they would have been forced by circumstance to strike up a
conversation, cell phones now provide a socially acceptable way to be
at the party ... but not.</TE>
<TE>   "They can reduce the need to create bridges," Zey said. "It allows
people to exclude the people who may be in front of them and to
interact with people they already know who are someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   Cell phones have also encouraged a sudden urgency to connect with
friends and family with little regard to the content of the
conversation. Cell phone conversations, as anyone who has ridden
public transportation, walked through a shopping mall or been to the
beach can attest, are usually not about much. A recent three-panel
cartoon in the New Yorker jokes around with some cell phone users'
apparent need to always be on the phone. The first panel shows a
businessman entering a train talking on a cell phone with the
caption, "I'm boarding the train." In the next, which shows the man
on the train, he says, "I'm on the train." And in the last one,
showing the cell phone user leaving, he says: "I'm leaving the
train."</TE>
<TE>   "I think people have become more dependent on being in constant
touch with others," said Edward Tenner, author of the 1997 book "Why
Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended
Consequences." "If you're not always accessible, people get anxious."</TE>
<TE>   So where are cell phones taking us, and what may be next?</TE>
<TE>   Within the next five years, the much-talked-about idea of
"convergence" will probably transform today's cell phones into one
super machine. In addition to phone capabilities, the device will
also have e-mail, computer and video abilities. It may take five
years after that, says Petersen, for the price of the all-in-one
device to come down enough for widespread usage.</TE>
<TE>   "Cell phones and what is coming is what is driving globalization,"
says Petersen, a former staff member of the National Security Council
at the Reagan White House. "I think what we're seeing is an almost
biological evolution of the species. I think we're building a global
nervous system and brain."</TE>
<TE>   And if that happens, perhaps we won't have to put up with cell
yell anymore.</TE>

<LD>Poor Hester Prynne. She probably wouldn't like the speed and ease
with which a new sewing machine can crank out a scarlet letter A, but
Anaheim Angel fans and home embroiderers may.</LD>
<LD>   Bernina's Arista 200e, which arrives in stores this week, is the
first sewing and embroidery system powered by Microsoft Windows.
Touch the keyboard on the built-in screen and you'll see letters--in
various fonts and from seven alphabets--duplicated onto fabric faster
than by any other home craft machine. The Microsoft CE. NEToperating
system also allows you to connect to the Internet. Browse through a
vast library of embroidery designs stored on a Web site or CD, and
download the ones you want to copy. Or create original designs on
your computer and import them into the sewing machine's brain.
Whatever you send its way--even digital photographs or your kid's
artwork--can be converted into a stitching pattern that the machine
can read.</LD>
<LD>   Engineering eggheads from Bernina and Microsoft spent three years
working with those who sew to make the machine perform complicated
tricks in easy steps.</LD>
<TE>   Menus and icon buttons on the index card-size color screen make it
possible to see and edit stitches before they're sewn. If you don't
like a stitch, there are 850 others to play with. Block letters,
mirror images and a host of other type styles can be arched, rotated
and resized in seconds. Stitches can be directed a dozen different
ways, including sideways and in circles.</TE>
<TE>   When an image's height or width is enlarged (up to 5 1/2 inches by
10 inches) or reduced, the computer recalculates the number of
stitches needed to maintain the quality of the design and its stitch
density. It then displays the altered image on the screen and tells
you how long it will take to complete the job.</TE>
<TE>   Quilters, embroiderers and sewers can walk away as the Arista
pumps out 600 stitches a minute. It can wind a bobbin while it's
sewing. And when it's done, it cuts and ties the thread. The tireless
machine doesn't stop even when it's turned off. Your designs and
customized settings can be saved in on-screen folders, and the
machine will remember your last 15 stitches when you restart it.</TE>
<TE>   To guide you through unfamiliar territory, dealers provide
in-store classes, and, when you're home alone, you can use the CD
tutorials. All of these gee-whizzes come with a high-tech price:
$7,000, plus optional software.</TE>
<TE>   A list of authorized Bernina dealers is available at (800)
877-9477; www.berninausa.com. Mel's Sewing Service stores in Anaheim,
Huntington Beach and Tustin offer free demonstrations. Call (714)
774-3460; www.melssewing.com.</TE>
<TE>   Suds and Duds, Online</TE>
<TE>   Techies have been bragging about smart machines for years, but
finally there's something that can rid college students of their
biggest headache. No, not the prof who insists that Carbon-14 is an
isotope and not an element. We're talking about laundry.</TE>
<TE>   IBM and USA Technologies have created Web-enabled washers and
dryers that make it possible for dorm dwellers to cut down their time
pacing around the laundry room. Students access a Web site on their
PC or laptop to check if there's an empty machine. After trudging to
the laundry room and putting in a load, they activate the machines by
swiping an ID card through a reader or by punching in their code on a
cell phone. No more begging for quarters and no reason to stick
around. Students can dispense soap and fabric softener during the
wash cycle with the click of a mouse, and be alerted by e-mail to
their computers or pagers when clothes are ready.</TE>
<TE>   Boston College served as the field test for the program, and
negotiations are underway to retrofit more than 9,000 on-campus
washing machines and dryers across the country to accept the wireless
commands. For more information: www.e-Suds.net.</TE>
<TE>   Whole New Dimension</TE>
<TE>   A gentleman farmer in San Diego County had a problem with wayward
produce. Plastic grocery bags of avocados, lemons and oranges would
roll around in the back of his Jeep. His solution? Fiskars' Kangaroo
bucket, which springs open when needed but can be flattened to 2
inches and shoved under a car seat when empty.</TE>
<TE>   The 1 1/2-foot-high vinyl bag holds 10-gallons of fruit--or
whatever--when it's upright. It is washable and mildew-resistant, and
has sturdy nylon handles, but no lid. It's available for $15 at the
Container Store in Costa Mesa (714) 556-2333 and San Diego (619)
220-0909; www.containerstore.com.</TE>

<LD>Look closely in a flowerbed and you will find a kingdom of small
creatures living there. Many of them are good for the garden, but
some, generally called pests, can harm plants. Our friend the spider
does the important job of helping get rid of garden pests.</LD>
<LD>   0rb weavers are a type of spider common in local gardens. They get
their name because they weave webs into a circle, or "orb," shaped
like a wheel with spokes.</LD>
<LD>   The orb weaver begins its web by spinning strong silk threads from
"spinnerets," openings on the underside of its body. The silk threads
are then carried by a breeze and form a bridge from one plant to
another, sometimes several feet away. From that bridge, the spider
begins forming the spokes of her web.</LD>
<TE>   Then the spider spins a different kind of silk that is sticky and
used to connect the spokes with circles. Flies, ants, bees and other
insects get caught in the sticky web, becoming dinner for the spider.</TE>
<TE>   Late summer is a good time to watch orb weavers at work. This is
when they are becoming adults and can be as big as 1 1/2 inches long.
Some orb weavers are black with bright yellow markings, and some are
golden brown. The webs, which can be up to 2 feet across, are found
in the open spaces between bushes or trees. Look for the spider right
in the center of the web, waiting to pounce on an ensnared insect.</TE>
<TE>   If you find an orb weaver in your garden, watch it work. But don't
hurt it--it helps your plants, and it won't hurt you.</TE>
<TE>   You can see orb spiders and lots more at Descanso Gardens. For
more information, call (818) 949-4200 or visit www.Descanso
Gardens.org.</TE>

<LD>She was an American expatriate who had moved to Paris after
graduating from the San Francisco Art Institute, a romantic who loved
the flourishes of the Neoclassical and Baroque periods. He was
French, known for his spare designs for industrial-style furnishings
and for an award-winning series of fashion shops around the world.
They fell in love. It could have been a design nightmare.</LD>
<LD>   But, though they thought they were pretty well set in their ways,
they surprised themselves.</LD>
<LD>   "We met later in life," says Erica Lennard, a much-published
garden and interiors photographer, of her relationship with husband
Denis Colomb. "We were both adults, we had very evolved tastes, and
we both had created our own environments that expressed our visions.</LD>
<TE>   "I first met Denis in New York, where he had done the French
Designers Show House, and I loved what he did there. But when he
described his apartment in Paris, I was really worried. I never liked
anything modern, and I didn't understand it. I was thinking, 'Oh, my
God, I'm going to go there, and I'm going to hate his apartment, and
then I won't like him anymore.' But I just fell in love with it. It
was very simple and very advanced for the time. Everything was placed
very low or very high, but it was so comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Colomb's first visit to Lennard's Paris apartment was also a trip
into a very different world. She had created what he calls an
"extreme fantasy of French style" that nevertheless was, he says,
similar in flavor to the 19th century antique-filled home of his
youth. Unlike his ancestral home, however, "Erica's home was not at
all bourgeois. It was artistic, with gold wallpaper in the kitchen
and very feminine. I thought it was charming."</TE>
<TE>   Nine years later, Lennard, 50, and Colomb, 45, live in a
three-level Mediterranean-style 1926 house in Whitley Heights, a
neighborhood of grand old residences tucked into the winding streets
of the Hollywood Hills. In their time together the two have also
shared homes in Paris, New York and Aix-en-Provence, France--the last
is where Colomb grew up. And, along the way, they've learned how to
meld their different styles and still create environments that are
distinctive and livable.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, they decided to take what they had learned about
collaborating on their homes and make a book of it. That was a
natural choice for Lennard, whose many books include the photo
collections "Classic Gardens" (Lustrum Press, 1982) and "Artists'
Gardens," (Abrams, 1993), and her collaboration with author Veronique
Vienne on the popular "The Art of Doing Nothing" and "The Art of
Imperfection" (both published by Clarkson Potter).</TE>
<TE>   Rather than use only their experience to offer advice, they also
sought out 15 other duos--all friends from the design worlds of
France, New York and L.A. who have also faced the challenge of
blending strong visions. The result is "Living Together: How Couples
Create Design Harmony at Home," co-authored with Julie Szabo and due
out in October from Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang.</TE>
<TE>   The book contains stories of each of the couples along with many
tips on how to find common ground. On the final page, "ten steps to
harmonious living" lists principles clearly in evidence in the
authors' own home. Truisms of marriage are applied here, such as
"mutual respect is essential," or "divide up responsibilities to
achieve your goals." But as designers, perhaps the most important
lesson in evidence is: "Remember your tastes will change and evolve
along with your relationship."</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of Lennard's and Colomb's collective design
philosophy is a taste for comfort and an eye for the unusual. They
call their L.A. home, which they are renting and have lived in for
just over a year, a work in progress. "Don't expect a harmonious
living arrangement to materialize overnight," they write in their
book, and, indeed, they are working on the house room by room and did
not feel compelled, for example, to paint the whole home at once or
even finish all the floors. Instead, they give themselves time to
focus on individual rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The couple love to entertain, so they tackled the house's most
public spaces first. The lower floor, with a grand salon and foyer,
is the closest area to being finished. It's mostly Spanish in feel,
largely because of two staircases with black wrought-iron banisters
that lead to delicate balconies. Tall arched windows keep the rooms
well-lighted by day.</TE>
<TE>   The living room and the foyer are generous in scale and can easily
accommodate the couple's tendency to mix and match furnishings in
unlikely ways. Lennard and Colomb travel frequently, for work and
pleasure, and they have a particular interest in the Far East. As a
result, their home incorporates a variety of international
flourishes. In the living room, a set of wooden dining chairs inlaid
with bone were brought over from a trip to Rajasthan, India, evidence
of Lennard's eye for the exotic.</TE>
<TE>   Ornate jewel and metalwork chests imported from Thailand flank a
doorway in the foyer. Mixed in are designs from Colomb's home
collection, which includes sofas, tables, rugs and tiles. A simple
Colomb day bed greets the visitor at the front entrance, and his
playful new line of wool rugs woven with geometric patterns are
scattered throughout. Erica's presence is also all over the walls,
which are covered by her black and white photographs of landscapes,
as well as art by some of their friends.</TE>
<TE>   "If you expect to be mixing a lot of colorful objects, especially
ones with radically different provenances, choose a unifying neutral
scheme for the walls," the book tells us, and indeed, the first order
of business here was to paint the living room's high-ceilinged walls
cream-colored (they were salmon before) and to darken the wooden
floors. If not much of the decor resembles their descriptions of
their earlier Paris apartments, it is because both believe that when
you move into a new home, you have to accommodate the needs of the
new space, even as you bring to it your own personal effects. Objects
that may have worked in the last place can be placed in storage or
given away, replaced by new things that fit better.</TE>
<TE>   "You design for the space," Colomb says in a visit to their home.
"Each place has a story. For me, the best thing would be if, when you
leave a house, you could leave everything in it. Except for the
things you are attached to--art, books, music."</TE>
<TE>   "You want them to have another life," Lennard says. "I gave things
from my Paris apartment to a friend who'd bought a house in Provence
and needed furniture. It looks fantastic there, and I can go and
visit it."</TE>
<TE>   Finding a house they both love is always key, and indeed this one,
which belongs to friends who decided to move to Malibu, had been a
favorite haunt for Lennard and Colomb long before it became
available. Since their work is itinerant and their home base is
governed only by the availability of e-mail and overnight delivery,
their move to Los Angeles was a spontaneous response to the
opportunity to rent the home. As artists, the move has paid off for
them. "We have been inspired by this house," Colomb says. In the past
year, his designs for furniture and rugs have changed as well,
becoming more colorful and textured.</TE>
<TE>   They have kept a few modern pieces, added some new finds from
their travels to China and India, and picked up a lot more objects in
Los Angeles. In a small inset fireplace in a large outdoor terrace on
the home's second level, Colomb has set up a display of colorful
decorative tiles of his designs and those of three partners. Four
garden chairs picked up for $5 at a junk shop in Silver Lake are a
prized possession. "We used to bring things from other countries
more, but in Los Angeles, that wasn't necessary. You can find
everything here," Lennard says. "That could be a book in itself,"
says Colomb.</TE>
<TE>   Included among the lushly illustrated selections of "Living
Together"--all the photographs are by Lennard--are the Los Angeles
homes of photographer and author Tim Street-Porter and interior
designer Annie Kelly, restaurateur Michele Lamy and fashion designer
Rick Owens, and landscape designer Julie Milligan and her partner,
real-estate developer Jackie Yellin.</TE>
<TE>   The book describes the design compromises the couples have found
for their living spaces. "If one of you is bold about color and
pattern but the other is not, don't take risks on things like tile
and flooring that are difficult to replace," the authors write. And
if you hire professionals to help, listen to their advice.</TE>
<TE>   Every home illustrated here is distinctive. Perhaps the most
unusual is that of Lamy and Owens; he uses displays of his dress
designs as decorative elements in their converted storefront
household. They also eschew anything resembling a kitchen, preferring
instead to eat out at Lamy's Les Deux Cafes across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Two artists, April Gornik and Eric Fischl, built a haven in the
Hamptons that combines Mediterranean, Japanese and Arts and Crafts
influences and includes two separate but adjoined studio spaces.
Their furnishings are old and new, including a silk-clad Indian
daybed, a French 1940s chair and mahogany cabinets built by Fischl's
former assistant. "Building a house is ... an externalized,
concretized version of what you interior dynamic is," Fischl says in
the book. "It's two people trying to possess something equally, and
it's something every couple should experience."</TE>
<TE>   "Recognizing a partner's quirks and accepting them with a smile
can make home life interesting and fun," Lennard and Colomb write in
one of the book's "harmonious how-to's."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, says Lennard, it's all about love for each other,
finding ways to share the experience of making a home--and making it
fun. For Lennard and Colomb, shopping together is enjoyable, in part
because they share the same self-assured instinctive approach. "Five
minutes," says Colomb, snapping his fingers and shaking his head for
emphasis. "We go into a shop, and we know if we want something in
five minutes. It's very fast."</TE>
<TE>   Lennard nods in agreement. The trick is to always carry a floor
plan and a measuring tape, just in case, Colomb says. And though they
say they agree on most purchases, both know that there will be
occasions when one person will have to compromise .</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to defer to Denis, because I trust him," Lennard says.</TE>
<TE>   "Erica has opened my eyes to color and to textiles," adds Colomb.
"She woke me up."</TE>

<LD>   The words in italics are stage directions that give you

<LD>   The characters for Scene 4 are Mac, T-Bone, Clifford and Cleo.
Cleo is sitting primly on a tree stump, watching.</LD>
<TE>   CLEO: Find any bones yet, guys?</TE>
<TE>   MAC: No. We haven't. Have you?</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: I don't think Cleo could find any bones. She isn't
digging.</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Why aren't you digging, Cleo?</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: I'd get much too dirty! My job is to tell everyone else what
to do. It's a princess thing.</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: I don't get it.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Emily Elizabeth reads a lot of stories about princesses to
you, right, Clifford?</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Sure! I love those stories!</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Has she ever read one where the princess digs in the dirt?</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: No. But you love to dig in the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: I used to. But I'm different now. I'm a princess.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: You still look like Cleo to me.</TE>
<TE>   MAC: (a very large bone in his mouth) Hey! I found one!</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Wow! That's really big, Mac!</TE>
<TE>   MAC: Why don't you crack it into pieces, Clifford--so we can all
share it!</TE>
<TE>   Clifford crunches it down to four uneven pieces.</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Since you found the bone, Mac, you get to pick the first
piece.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Ahem. Don't you think I should pick first?</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: But we always say that whoever finds the bone gets to pick
the first piece.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: That was before we knew I was a princess.</TE>
<TE>   Cleo shoves Mac aside.</TE>
<TE>   CLEO: Pardon me, Mac. Princess chooses first. You understand,
right?</TE>
<TE>   MAC: What?</TE>
<TE>   Cleo picks the biggest piece and trots away.</TE>
<TE>   MAC: That wasn't fair.</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: No, it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: Being a princess shouldn't mean that you can be unfair.</TE>
<TE>   MAC: Cleo is acting like a completely different dog--just because
she's wearing a crown.</TE>
<TE>   T-BONE: I liked her better the way she was before she became a
princess.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford drops his head in between his two friends.</TE>
<TE>   CLIFFORD: Me too, T-Bone.</TE>

<LD>   Court Orders P. Diddy to Pay $2.45 Million</LD>
<LD>   Rapper Sean "P. Diddy" Combs has been ordered to pay $2.45 million
in damages to a man who says he was injured by Combs' bodyguards at a
1995 Mary Blige concert.</LD>
<TE>   A Superior Court judge in North Carolina ordered that Combs make
payment to Cedrick Bobby Lemon, a limousine driver who was working at
the Joel Coliseum in Winston-Salem on the night of the concert. Lemon
said in his lawsuit that he was beaten by two bodyguards employed by
Combs, who was acting as Blige's manager at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The judge ordered the payment Sept. 10 because Combs didn't answer
the allegations against him within a 30-day time limit required by
state law. Nathalie Moar, a spokeswoman for Combs, said this week,
"We have just learned of this lawsuit. As it has no merit whatsoever,
we intend to take all necessary steps to have it dismissed."</TE>
<TE>   Papa's Got a Brand New ... Family-Style Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   James Brown's daughters have filed a federal lawsuit against the
Godfather of Soul, seeking more than $1 million in back royalties and
damages for 25 songs they say they co-wrote when they were children.</TE>
<TE>   Deanna Brown Thomas, who works at a South Carolina radio station,
and Dr. Yamma Brown Lumar, a Texas physician, say Brown has withheld
royalties because of a family grudge. The singer was reportedly upset
when, in 1998, Thomas had her father committed to a psychiatric
hospital to be treated for addiction to painkillers. After his
release, Brown "vowed to the media that his daughters will never get
a dime from him," the lawsuit said. "James Brown has kept his word."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 69, could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<TE>   Kennedy Center to Receive a Face-Lift</TE>
<TE>   The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington
is in store for a landscaping face-lift and expansion that, over 10
years, will create eight acres of pedestrian-friendly green space and
two new buildings to house offices, rehearsal studios and an
exhibition hall devoted to the history of the performing arts.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush on Wednesday signed a bill--passed unanimously by
both houses of Congress--authorizing $400 million to lower the
Potomac Freeway and create a plaza above it east of the 31-year-old
Kennedy Center. The long-envisioned project will make it possible for
people to walk from the National Mall to the center without having to
cross highways.</TE>
<TE>   The Kennedy Center, which houses six theaters, will need to raise
an estimated $250 million in private donations to pay for the
buildings, said Tiki Davies, the center's spokeswoman.</TE>

<KH>Spring 2003 NEW YORK COLLECTIONS</KH>
<HD>Win-Lose-Whim Starts Big Week</HD>
<DH>Von Furstenberg mixes styles well, Sarafpour disappoints,
IOC amuses</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--Although Fashion Week hadn't officially started at the
Bryant Park tents, the spring 2003 collections were launched here
with a smattering of designers, some renegades, showing around the
city Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Diane von Furstenberg's collection could have careened out of
control faster than Martha Stewart's career with such disparate
references as Sandra Dee, Sailor Jerry tattoos, Bollywood and Studio
54. Luckily, her disciplined hand kept things together on the runway
at her Meatpacking District studio.</LD>
<LD>   Pieces such as a red-and-black heart tattoo-print chiffon
shirtdress; a black matte jersey, '50s-style dance dress with a full
skirt and contrasting white trim; and a blue ombre wrap dress that
was a clever take on a sari proved once again that Von Furstenberg is
the master mixer of sexy and sweet. She knows what she's good at and
what her customer has come to expect, and wisely she doesn't often
deviate.</LD>
<TE>   Behnaz Sarafpour, on the other hand, is still figuring out what
kind of designer she wants to be. Those hoping for more of the
understated elegance she demonstrated in her fall collection
presented in February (silk, bias-cut gowns and boxy, quilted jackets
with pretty flower piping, for example) will be disappointed by this
follow-up presented around the corner from Von Furstenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Sarafpour, who also designs the Barneys New York collection,
seemed to present the two sides of the 1960s beginning with
Courreges-like mini-dresses in black and white, some with flutter
sleeves and others worn with gold chain-mail bibs or belts. The Space
Age faded into the Age of Aquarius with canvas jackets and pants and
silk dresses hand-painted in Starburst shades of pink, blue, orange,
green and yellow for a tie-dye effect. Although her hippie-chick
separates will no doubt be salable, particularly to the Roberto
Cavalli-wearing set, the collection as a whole didn't seem as special
as Sarafpour's previous three efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The clothes were beside the point on East 57th Street, where the
merry pranksters from Imitation of Christ were up to their old
tricks. For its latest act of fashion disobedience, the design
collective whose members include founder Tara Subkoff and actress
Chloe Sevigny brought the show to the street, filling the windows of
the Maurice Villency furniture store with tarted-up models in the
usual--reworked thrift-store finds. The show was billed as a
retrospective and set up much like an art gallery opening, complete
with a performance piece--topless models vacuuming. (You can't make
this stuff up.)</TE>
<TE>   Passersby were almost as confused as invited guests. "I think this
is Fashion Week in New York," said Gerrie Licausi, an interior
designer from Long Island who was strolling past the scene with her
husband. Asked if she had ever heard of Imitation of Christ, she
said, "I think I had the book when I was a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Vicky Kerner, a physician in Manhattan, stopped for a gander at
the bare gams. "What can I think?" she said. "I'm fat and old!"</TE>
<TE>   Imitation of Christ held its first show in a Metro station in L.A.
in 2000 and has since staged happenings at a Lower East Side funeral
parlor and at Chelsea Market, where the models were seated in the
audience critiquing guests in a fashion-show role reversal. In 2001,
IOC produced a short film featuring famous pals such as Reese
Witherspoon and Lisa Marie that juxtaposed the excesses of a movie
premiere with the exploitation of workers in sweatshops. It was shown
at a Midtown theater during Fashion Week.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the fashion media balk at having to indulge the antics of
IOC, which doesn't have wide distribution or sales.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but if you ask me, the group is a healthy reminder that
nobody should take fashion too seriously.</TE>

<LD>The Dixie Chicks hold onto the No. 1 spot on the nation's album
charts, but industry attention is on next week's singles charts,
which "American Idol" singer Kelly Clarkson is a cinch to dominate.</LD>
<LD>   Her label, RCA, is making no predictions for the single, which was
released Tuesday, but some retailers are saying the record could sell
150,000 copies. That's massive in a singles market that has shrunk so
much in recent years that a single can be No. 1 by selling just 4,600
copies--which is what Nivea's "Don't Mess With My Man" sold to top
this week's chart.</LD>
<LD>   Both songs on the Clarkson single, "Before You Love" and "A Moment
Like This," are power ballads that show a lot of lung power but not
much convincing character. The test will be when her album is
released late this year or early next year. RCA, meanwhile, will
release "American Idol: Greatest Moments" on Oct. 1. It includes
studio versions of songs from the TV show.</LD>
<TE>   To hold on to No. 1, the Dixie Chicks' "Home" album sold 214,000
for a three-week total of 1.3 million. The rock group Disturbed's
"Believe" album will challenge for the top spot next week. The other
spots on this week's Top 10 album chart are held by Avril Lavigne,
Eminem, Nelly, Toby Keith, Bruce Springsteen, Norah Jones, Coldplay,
Clipse and James Taylor.</TE>

<LD>   In the last nine years, Montreal's Cirque Eloize has wandered the
globe, performing in 200 cities and 20 countries. So is it any wonder
that the group's newest creation is titled "Nomade" and celebrates
the life of traveling show people? In the words of director Daniele
Finzi Pasca, "This tribute to nomads conveys the frenzy of their
celebrations, the mysteries of their rituals and the passion with
which they carve out their destinies." Of course, it also displays
their acclaimed skills at singing, dancing, juggling and acrobatics.
After the U.S. premiere of "Nomade" at UCLA this weekend, the company
goes to 39 other cities, giving performances at Thousand Oaks Civic
Arts Plaza on Nov. 13 and the California Center for the Arts in
Escondido Nov. 25 to 27.</LD>

<TE>   An abandoned Japanese amusement park proves to be the gateway to a
long-lost land of gods and spirits for a resourceful 10-year-old girl
in "Miyazaki's Spirited Away." The creation of an English-language
version of this fantasy, the eighth film by acclaimed director Hayao
Miyazaki ("Princess Mononoke"), was overseen by Pixar's John Lasseter
(the "Toy Story" films, "Monsters, Inc."), who refers to Miyazaki as
"the David Lean of animation."</TE>
<TE>   "Miyazaki's Spirited Away," rated PG for some scary moments, opens
Friday exclusively at the El Capitan Theatre, 6838 Hollywood Blvd.,
Hollywood. (800) 347-6396.</TE>

with such jazz legends as John Coltrane, Art Blakey and Max Roach, as
well as with classical orchestras including the New York
Philharmonic, the National Orchestra and the NBC Symphony Orchestra.
In his spare time, Davis earned a doctoral degree in clinical
psychology from New York University. This weekend, Davis will present
his annual John Coltrane Tribute at the World Stage in Leimert Park.
Performing with him will be saxophonists Doug Webb, Charles Owens and
Oran Coltrane, pianist Nate Morgan and drummer Donald Dean.</TE>

<TE>   "Submit; resistance is futile" might be the mantra for Maggie
Gyllenhaal's character in the decidedly offbeat romantic comedy
"Secretary," directed by Steven Shainberg. Gyllenhaal, in a breakout
performance, stars as an ungainly young woman who blooms during a
light-hearted sadomasochistic relationship with her boss (James
Spader). Erin Cressida Wilson adapted Mary Gaitskill's novella.
Jeremy Davies and Lesley Anne Warren co-star.</TE>

of behavioral disorders, and language, opens Friday in selected

<TE>   Dance</TE>
<TE>   Launching a performance series of experimental work in intimate
UCLA spaces, Yin Mei Dance presents the Southern California premiere
of "/Asunder" in the campus' MacGowan Little Theater. Born in China,
choreographer Ying Mei has what the New York Times calls "a striking
visual sense and an authoritative way with social and literary
themes." For this 90-minute study of the union of opposites, composer
Robert Een has created an atmospheric score for voice, vibraphone,
cello and percussion, and designer Cai Guo-Qiang conjures up a
moonlit pool and a flurry of 1,000 arrows that becomes a path of
feathers. There's also a story--about a monk in love with his enemy's
daughter--but don't expect conventional narrative in this dreamlike,
intricately layered theater of images. And that slash in the title?
The pause before action, Yin Mei says.</TE>

fiestas from Jalisco and Veracruz; plus more personal statements like
"Revolution," for instance, which contains Hernandez's tribute to the
heroic women who fought to make Mexico free. It is said that every
Latino folklore company is either copying Hernandez or in rebellion

Contemporary Art, San Diego salutes the fabric and fiber-draped
temporary monuments of Christo and Jeanne-Claude in "Christo and
Jeanne-Claude in the Vogel Collection From the National Gallery of
Art," opening Sunday. For those not familiar with the works of
Christo, the conceptual artist has a history of building enormous,
temporary installations such as the 24-mile "running fence" across
Sonoma and Marin counties, a forest of 3,100 giant blue-and-gold
umbrellas in Los Angeles and Tokyo, a golden-wrapped Pont Neuf bridge
in Paris and a shiny-wrapped Reichstag. The first such survey in the
U.S. will feature 61 objects including several early-wrapped
packages, models for large-scale public works, drawings and collages
for projects in urban and rural sites, and photographs of completed
projects.</LD>

<LD>On a night not that long ago in an Echo Park club, a crew of
backward-baseball-cap-and football-jersey-wearing high school-aged
hip-hoppers stands with their arms crossed like Run-DMC. They
occasionally glance at a pair of girls behind them in a candlelit
booth but don't make a move to talk to them. One of the girls buys a
drink for her underage friend, and they settle into an animated
conversation.</LD>
<LD>   On the other side of the dance floor, propped up against the bar,
are a couple of fellows who look like the "Y Tu Mama Tambien" guys
scoping out the scene.</LD>
<LD>   Around 11:30 p.m., the crowd--equal parts Asian, Latino, white and
black--inches toward the dance floor at Bassline, a hip-hop, reggae
and drum-and-bass club at the Echo on Sunset Boulevard. Things start
picking up with a rapid succession of DJs and mike-wielders. One kid
shows up sporting a breakin' outfit circa 1984, while some other boys
who can really bust a move twirl about like mosquitoes. A remarkable
and crucial social spot for high schoolers, all-age hangouts like
Bassline provide an alternative to the doing-homework, watching-TV,
slurping-on-a-Big Gulp routine, as well as the somewhat pathetic
hanging-out-at-Denny's, attempting-to-locate-a-house-party typical
teen weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Go into any neighborhood and it's easy enough to find the local
burger joints and 7-Elevens that form the core of everyday hangouts
for the under-21 crowd. But the real draws are the all-ages clubs and
Internet cafes scattered through the region that cater to their
specific dilemma. These clubs operate sans liquor licenses and are a
tough enough business proposition that many don't make it for long.
In just the last decade, once rockin' all-ages clubs like the
Alligator Lounge, Jabberjaw, Socco and Impala Cafe in L.A., PCH in
Wilmington and Koo's Art Cafe in Santa Ana have dropped off the map.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a mixed bag of door policies that make it tough for
the underage crowd to participate in much of L.A.'s music-driven
nightlife. The Troubadour, the Whisky, the Roxy, the Hollywood
Palladium and the Knitting Factory are generally all-ages and have
fantastic bookings and exceptional sound systems. But if kids want to
swing at the Derby or check out their favorite band at the Garage, no
way, no how. And forget picking up on 21-year-olds at a goth or glam
club.</TE>
<TE>   The constant churn in what is and is not open to the under-21
crowd keeps them on the prowl for hangouts where they can mingle with
members of the opposite sex who dig the same kind of music and might
not go to their high school, where they can get up on stage and read
bad death-rock poetry or have their bands play and where they don't
have to spend much dough. It's a constant search for age-appropriate
cool.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Caballero, 20, was standing outside this sad beach club in
his neighborhood, Suzy's in Hermosa Beach, while his friends' band,
the Rolling Blackouts, were whaling away on their instruments inside.</TE>
<TE>   An authentic fanatic when it comes to music, Caballero doesn't go
to shows to look for a girlfriend or socialize with his pals. For
him, it's strictly about the bands, and the majority of them play
21-and-over clubs that won't let him in the door. Suzy's does
occasionally have all-ages shows during the day, but after 9 p.m.,
Caballero's only option is to sit in the patio and watch the show
through a window.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a drag because there is nowhere to go," says
Caballero. "People will have shows in their garage or their backyard,
but there's no real permanent place in the South Bay. Even at a place
like Suzy's, where they have midday shows, the cops will still come
and harass everyone. That's just the way it is. It's pretty barren."</TE>
<TE>   For a while, a friend, Greg Sidman, 19, was putting on shows in
his parents' garage on a secluded street in Hermosa Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents were cool about it," says Sidman, "until some dumb
friend of ours started throwing bottles in the street and the police
came. We could fit about 30 people in the garage and we would have
local bands play. But one time, someone stepped in my parents' shower
and left footprints, and they got really angry about that, because
people weren't supposed to go in the house. It was a culmination of
the shower incident and the bottles that ended it."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the tenuous life of the backyard underage scene.</TE>
<TE>   There are a few major places, like the Chain Reaction in Anaheim
and the Knitting Factory in Hollywood, but numerous kids complain
that they're missing out on the action. "I want to go to Club Sugar,
Giant and Spundae, but they are all over-21 clubs," says 19-year-old
Mick Magno of Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Daisy Tigler, a 15-year-old Santa Monica High School student, says
most of the kids she knows just go to a house and hang out. "Someone
buys a keg," she says. "I wish I could go to the Key Club and the
Viper Room, but usually I have to choose between hanging out on the
Third Street Promenade or going to one of these keg parties."</TE>
<TE>   And there are the underground raves. Scott Rose, who grew up in
Milan, Italy, and moved to L.A. when he was 16, started hanging out
around Melrose Avenue and saw fliers for different raves; about half
were all-ages.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other local happening, the unregulated nature of
raves means they cater to the 18-and-under set. The phenomenon, which
arrived in L.A. in the early '90s, tapered off a bit after extensive
news coverage of drug use. Some evolved into aboveground clubs that
are 21-or 18-and over. But underground raves are still fairly common
in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are really into the music and love it, it's not hard to
find little dance parties that still go on and people of all ages
go," says 21-year-old raver Heather Garrell, of Westwood. "There are
Web sites like ravelinks.com, which have events for every day of the
week."</TE>
<TE>   For kids who don't care for glow sticks or Dr. Seuss hats, the
night-life situation in L.A. is not entirely grim. In fact, for the
kids without fake IDs and the 17-year-old girls who are not able to
charm their way past doormen, there is a decent selection of all-ages
hangouts.</TE>
<TE>   Caballero plays bass in a hard rock band called dios and sports a
flowing, free-form rock hairdo. When he was 16, he started hanging
out at PCH, a smelly warehouse in an industrial district where
numerous shows went on undisturbed for a couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he'll sometimes drive to Anaheim to check out a show at the
Chain Reaction or head over to Sacred Grounds in San Pedro, where the
all-ages-devoted folks who used to run Koo's Cafe occasionally book
shows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About a half-hour drive south of downtown L.A. in Fullerton is an
all-ages hangout called the Hub. On a recent Saturday night, five
young kids dressed in suits, called the Pop Narcotic, thrash around
on a crowded, though roomy, leaf-strewn patio. The band's singer
leaps up on a table and then runs, mike cable trailing behind him,
into the Hub's coffeehouse next door while yelping the chorus, "This
place is not for rent!" But mostly the lyrics to their
Nation-of-Ulysses-sounding punk tunes are indecipherable.</TE>
<TE>   The Hub is a noisy place with plenty of hipsters and punks, pasted
with fliers and anarchist-environmental literature, though people in
the audience usually stay seated and drink coffee while the bands
play "I really enjoy the nights when they have bands here," says
17-year-old Orange County resident Andrew Toews, "because generally
they tend to be more underground, and being a musician, I like to
check out the aspiring talent. It's everything from indie-rock to
jazz to hip-hop to hard-core. But the crowd is always the same
people."</TE>
<TE>   Attached to the Hub is a unique video arcade called the Reagan
Years, which is adorned with Michael Jackson and "Flashdance" posters
and filled with arcade classics like Marble Madness, Galaga,
Burgertime, Tron and Elevator Action. Each game costs a quarter, as
they used to back in the Duran Duran era, and young kids, who might
associate Pac-Man with their parents, hang out at the Reagan Years
digging these low-tech games, which have more imaginative concepts
than a lot of contemporary games do.</TE>
<TE>   Cashing in on an interest in state-of-the-art PC and PlayStation
games is Badlanz, a new Internet gaming lounge in the ultra-trendy
Cahuenga Boulevard corridor, where it is surrounded by bars. But
Badlanz is sort of a nerd hangout in a sea of hip.</TE>
<TE>   It's for kids who are more interested in battling mutant cyborgs
than talking to girls. "I've been hanging out here all day every day
for nearly a year," says 14-year-old local David Provencio. "When I
was on vacation, me and my dad [who sits next to him with a shaved
head and eyebrow piercing] would come here from 5 in the afternoon
and stay here until 4:30 in the morning. I do a lot of other stuff
like basketball when I'm not here, but I'm always here."</TE>
<TE>   With its two-hours-for-the-price-of-one deal for students, Badlanz
is popular with local Hollywood high schoolers. "I see these kids out
in the street a lot," says owner Dave Veillon. "Other local business
owners like the fact that we give some of them a place to go."</TE>
<TE>   As for live bands, kids under 18 have several clubs that will
allow them entry. One of the most essential is the Smell downtown,
which has a real all-ages community behind it and draws kids from
far-flung hoods for improv-oriented indie-rock and avant-garde metal
nights.</TE>
<TE>   On one particular Saturday evening, an experimental band with
screeching violins and pounding drums called Young People performs,
lighted by only a couple of bulbs pointing in odd directions.</TE>
<TE>   A few bewildered and perhaps inebriated homeless people wander
among the crowd of snappily dressed youngsters (along with plenty of
oldsters). The audience is yawning a lot, though it is 1:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   When the music gets kind of rockin', a couple of girls twitch
around spastically. "No one from our school has ever been here except
us," says 18-year-old Rebecca Kolsrud, who graduated recently from
the all-girl Marlborough school. "The Smell has more interesting
music than a lot of other places. I've been here about 20 times. It's
an original place, because they let homeless people in, which is
really crazy. I kind of like it."</TE>
<TE>   Another popular spot for the KXLU-listening set is Fais Do-Do on
West Adams Boulevard, which hosts a varied lineup of dance clubs and
rock shows. Even at some of the bigger clubs that do have all-ages
nights, however, the vibe can be less than kid-friendly.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very aggressive at the front door," says Troubadour
manager Paul McGuigan. "If you try to use a fake ID, you're
forfeiting your ticket. If you get caught drinking in the club,
you're out, straight away. The kids hate us for that reason. But
that's good, that's the kind of business we want to be."</TE>
<TE>   Business, after all, is the bottom line, and it doesn't always
work out. "I think the all-ages scene has been a sad casualty of the
gentrification of much of L.A., with spiraling rents that have put a
lot of the all-ages clubs out of business," says Tim McDermott, owner
of Scooter's Records in Hermosa Beach. "I'm hard pressed to remember
a time when kids had as few options as they do today."</TE>
<TE>   And now, one fewer. The Echo and its happening hip-hop club
Bassline and the popular Punk Rock BBQ went 21-and-up for financial
reasons. And the crowd is searching for new places to hang yet again.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Smell</LD>
<LD>   247 S. Main St., downtown L.A. (213) 833-2843</LD>
<LD>   Art, experimental music, punk benefits for anarchist causes,
indie-rock, Japanese noise and underground film screenings make up
the bulk of the entertainment at this club, which looks and smells
like a squatter's camp. Having moved downtown from North Hollywood,
this club is absolutely vital to the all-ages scene.</LD>
<TE>   What the kids say: "It's nice to have a club that's not solely
based on making money."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chain Reaction</TE>
<TE>   1652 W. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim. (714) 635-6067</TE>
<TE>   Chain Reaction is perhaps O.C.'s key all-ages club, especially
since Koo's Art Cafe closed recently. Hosting punk rock, ska and the
occasional indie-rock shows (cover $7-$12), it is sweaty and crowded,
as a punk venue should be.</TE>
<TE>   What the kids say: "A lot of bands have a pretty big jock
following, but that's the same with any venue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fais Do-Do</TE>
<TE>   5257 W. Adams Blvd., Mid-City. (323) 954-8080</TE>
<TE>   John Coltrane played in this building in the '60s when it was an
underground club. Now Fais Do-Do might host a drum-and-bass club, a
neighborhood blues band, an R&amp;B diva, a KXLU benefit or a jazz and
spoken word night, as well as offering fine Cajun food in its New
Orleans-style saloon.</TE>
<TE>   What the kids say: "There are not very many security guards and a
really good mix of people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Badlanz</TE>
<TE>   602 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 464-5269</TE>
<TE>   The scene on Cahuenga Boulevard is not unlike the video games
inside this spacious Internet gaming lounge, with transvestite
hookers and various degenerates stumbling down the street. But inside
Badlanz, kids can listen to music over the Net or play multi-player
PC games in relative safety, most rolling in from 2:30 p.m. until 4
a.m. closing time.</TE>
<TE>   What the kids say: "A group of kids come here from my school and
play Medal of Honor, where we try our best to kill each other."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unurban Coffeehouse</TE>
<TE>   3301 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica. (310) 315-0056</TE>
<TE>   Unurban is a laid-back coffeehouse with rickety thrift store
furniture. It's a fine place for teens to drink hot chocolate, read a
book or just loiter--and there's the requisite open mike nights on
Fridays and Wednesdays, both popular with high school kids from
nearby Crossroads School. Several high-school-aged bands have
performed Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   McCabe's</TE>
<TE>   3101 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica. (310) 828-4403</TE>
<TE>   Down the street from the Unurban Coffeehouse, McCabe's is a guitar
store that hosts mostly acoustic, adult-oriented acts but is
all-ages. The $10 and $20 cover charges are a little pricey, but it
books the likes of Frank Black and Ben Lee.</TE>
<TE>   What the kids say: "It's good for seeing a really intimate
concert."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Hub</TE>
<TE>   124 E. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton. (714) 871-2233</TE>
<TE>   All of its shows are free. There's coffee and coffeehouse-type
food served by tattooed youngsters. The patio is a superb place to
chill among trees and heat lamps, and so are the tables facing the
parking lot and the nearby Fullerton Train Station and Greyhound Bus
Station. And in the back, a video arcade called the Reagan Years has
Tempest and Dig Dug. The Hub is the sort of all-ages neighborhood
hangout that all neighborhoods should have but few do.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Troubadour</TE>
<TE>   9081 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood. (310) 276-6168</TE>
<TE>   This well-known club, which once famously booted a drunk John
Lennon onto the pavement, books an amazing lineup of bands but also
has as many rules related to kids (no ins and outs to smoke, a $3
cover on the free night) as some high schools.</TE>
<TE>   What the kids say: "They are pretty cool about letting kids wear
what they want compared to the Palace and the Palladium."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One Seven</TE>
<TE>   6800 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. (323) 461-2017</TE>
<TE>   Affiliated with Seventeen magazine, One Seven is a new dance club
exclusively for kids between the ages of 15 and 20, a spacious room
in the Hollywood &amp; Highland shopping complex with a vast wooden dance
floor, a large stage, giant video screens, fancy red lamps and a
nonalcoholic energy bar. The cover is $20, and the entertainment is
sugary and Britney Spears-oriented.</TE>
<TE>   What the kids say: "Kind of lame but packed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nova Express</TE>
<TE>   426 N. Fairfax Ave., Hollywood. (323) 658-7533</TE>
<TE>   Science fiction is the theme at Nova Express, a coffeehouse that
serves pizza and has DJs seven nights a week. The chill-out vibe
makes this a hang before and after raves, as it's open until 4 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cacao</TE>
<TE>   11609 Santa Monica Blvd., West L.A. (310) 473-7283</TE>
<TE>   Cacao is a simple tiki-themed coffeehouse where students from
University, Palisades and Windward schools hang out. It's located on
a lively, all-ages-oriented block of Santa Monica Boulevard, which
boasts a couple of sushi spots open late.</TE>

<LD>   Grasmere--This fictional meditation on William Wordsworth and
Samuel Taylor Coleridge is set in 1802 as Coleridge stays with
Wordsworth and his younger sister, Dorothy, in Grasmere in England's
Lake District. In this beautiful presentation by Chautauqua Theatre
Alliance at the Egyptian Arena Theatre, playwright Kristina Leach
explores a theme similar to those in Tom Stoppard's "Arcadia" and
David Auburn's "Proof," looking at the chauvinism that excludes
women's contributions from history's annals. Wordsworth (Logan
Sledge) and Coleridge (Aaron G. Lamb) had produced the first edition
of their influential "Lyrical Ballads" but were beginning to advance
along separate career paths, with Dorothy (Annie Di Martino) as
companion and muse. Leach's Cal State Fullerton production of
"Grasmere" was part of the 2002 American College Theater Festival's
national showcase at the Kennedy Center.</LD>

<HD>A Higher Purpose for Joshua Tree Climbers: Adopt-a-Crag</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDY MASUO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They come to Joshua Tree National Park to climb the raw faces of such
famous boulders as Headstone and Intersection rocks, cliff-clinging
nature lovers who find the stone there-- exposed and unspoiled faces
of quartz monzonite--a climber's dream of accessible but technical
routes.</LD>
<LD>   However, the surrounding desert ecosystem is not as tough as rock.</LD>
<LD>   The stark, arid conditions that make Joshua Tree seem an
unchangeable landscape of cartoonish dwarf trees and needle-sharp
cholla cactus also mean that man-made trails, campsites and trash can
last for decades.</LD>
<TE>   Now a nationwide network of rock climbers has set aside a day to
erase some of their tracks.</TE>
<TE>   "If you care about this climbing area and want to see it taken
care of, don't just use it. Give something back," says Paul
Blanchard, a veteran rock climber and co-manager of the Uprising Rock
Climbing Center in Palm Springs. When Access Fund, a national
organization dedicated to climbing and conservation, launched its
Adopt-a-Crag Day campaign three years ago, Blanchard didn't think
twice about lending a hand. In addition to his work at Uprising, he
also serves as a board member for Friends of Joshua Tree, the
nonprofit advocacy group for which he organizes the park's annual
Adopt-a-Crag event.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he'll lead a team of volunteers on a daylong
conservation adventure. From 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., his posse will help
restore the popular climbing areas near Hidden Valley, Belle and
White Tank campgrounds by collecting trash, cleaning up chalk marks
some climbers use to map out routes across the rock face, replanting
native flora in the random paths (called "social paths") that have
appeared, and marking main trails to discourage wandering.</TE>
<TE>   After the cleanup, volunteers are free to spend the rest of the
afternoon on the rocks and to hang out for an evening slide show and
raffle. The $10 suggested donation benefits Friends of Joshua Tree,
and donors receive the quarterly newsletter, Wonderland, and
membership in Friends of Joshua Tree. Raffle prizes range from
climbing gear to Clif Bars ($25 donors also receive a box lunch).</TE>
<TE>   The official Adopt-a-Crag Day is Sept. 7, but local groups around
the country schedule volunteer and fund-raising activities from
August through November. Blanchard is pleased that these grass-roots
organizations now work with--rather than against--the National Park
Service.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the issues we'll be working on on the 21st is so pressing
that the park will fall apart without us," Blanchard says, chuckling.
"We're working on projects related to climber access and keeping our
good relationship going with the National Park Service. Now they come
to us and say, 'Hey, this is happening in this area and we need to
get word out that people need to stop doing that.' So we put the word
out [through the newsletter and Web site] and volunteer time. We have
an open dialogue, which is great."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Adopt-a-Crag Day volunteers will meet at 7:30 a.m. Saturday at
Nomad Ventures Store, corner of Route 62 and Park Boulevard in the
town of Joshua Tree. For more information, contact: Friends of Joshua
Tree, (760) 366-9699, www.friendsofjosh.org; Uprising Rock Climbing

<DH>Music was once just a lark for Anna Waronker, but the
singer-songwriter now admits it's her calling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NATALIE NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back in the mid-'90s, singer-songwriter Anna Waronker and her
cute-grrrl band with the difficult name, that dog., were darlings of
their major label, Geffen-owned DGC. Now a solo artist, she can
conduct a tour of her new label, Five Foot Two Records, without even
leaving her living room couch.</LD>
<LD>   "There's the mail room," giggles the 30-year-old daughter of
veteran producer and record executive Lenny Waronker. She points to
packages heaped by the fireplace of her Hollywood Hills home. "The
A&amp;R room is over there," she adds, indicating a dining table behind
her. "This is the CEO's office right here," she continues, waving
toward a computer and desk near the front window. "See? It's even in
the corner, with a view."</LD>
<LD>   The first release for the company, which Waronker co-owns with
sister-in-law Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go's, is her solo debut,
"Anna by Anna Waronker." Although more grown-up, the songs musically
do recall the melodic pop and punk-flavored rock of that dog., which
Waronker formed in 1991 with high school pals Petra and Rachel Haden,
two children of jazz giant Charlie Haden. The band had a rocky
breakup in 1997, but these days, Waronker says, the three women are
friendly again, if not close.</LD>
<TE>   Vulnerable and slightly goofy, that dog. released three albums
preoccupied with crushes and puppy-love heartbreak. Waronker's songs
back then reflected a girlier aspect of the so-called "women in rock"
movement, not totally raging like such acts as PJ Harvey and Bikini
Kill, yet not all twirly like, say, folk-popper Natalie Merchant.</TE>
<TE>   Although the deliberate preciousness of that dog. turned off some
listeners, and its sales were never monumental, many critics were
impressed by the emotional honesty in Waronker's work. Her more
sophisticated solo collection, which she wrote and produced, comes at
a time when songcraft is being freshly appreciated by critics and
listeners.</TE>
<TE>   Waronker proves worthy of attention, adeptly shifting from the
pristine, strings-infused ballad "John &amp; Maria" to the swaggering
kiss-off "Perfect Ten" to the waltz-like fear-of-depression number
"Eat Me Alive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "When I got into that dog., I didn't consider myself a musician, a
singer or a songwriter," says Waronker, who was then 19. She
gradually stopped seeing it as a lark and concluded that music was
her calling. "After I started owning that identity, I really wanted
to get into it with that mature mind."</TE>
<TE>   She had hoped to do it with that dog. The band's final album,
1997's "Retreat From the Sun," was initially going to be Waronker's
solo debut. "I'd always wanted to do something [on my own], but I
never wanted to compromise the band," she says. "But after five years
or so, it was like, 'OK, I've gotta get this out.' It ended up kind
of making everything explode, because there was no balance."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Waronker's version of a nice adult life is all about
balance--or, really, balancing. In addition to starting the label,
she has penned songs for such films as "Josie and the Pussycats" and
various television shows. She also teamed with husband Steve
McDonald, of Redd Kross fame, to co-produce such acts as Imperial
Teen. And she's of course promoting "Anna," partly by planning a
forthcoming tour with McDonald's new band, SMG, which will release an
EP on Five Foot Two in November.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hectic pace, she says, working for herself "keeps me
incredibly centered. It was frustrating to create a piece of art and
then have to promote it on somebody else's word." But, she stresses,
her head for business comes more from her own experiences than from
her dad.</TE>
<TE>   "I never even saw him really as a businessman," Waronker says. "He
pulls all the strings, but he has--he'll probably laugh at this--a
really artistic vision, or he loves facilitating people's artistic
vision. I'm hoping to kind of follow in his footsteps." Yet she says
with a laugh, "Now I ask him for business advice, and he's always
like, 'I don't know.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Anna" pushed Waronker's already intimate songwriting into truly
personal territory. Although the emotions are specific, she
deliberately leaves room for listeners' interpretations. "My
songwriting is so much for my own therapy and whatever, but I also
feel like, if I'm gonna help people in the world, my way is through
songwriting," she says. "That's a little hokey, but I like reaching
out to people."</TE>
<TE>   Not that her initial intentions are always so noble. One batch of
songs she wrote after that dog. split up was "just really heavy and
harsh," she admits. She played one for her brother, drummer Joey
Waronker. "He said, 'It's great, but I don't think you're going to
want to sing this song for five years in a row. Why don't you write
something a little more positive?' "</TE>
<TE>   Annoyed, she huffed away and wrote "I Wish You Well" (which first
appeared on the "Pussycats" soundtrack, sung by Letters to Cleo's Kay
Hanley). Now, however, Waronker is glad she adjusted her attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better than every song being, like, 'I'm mad at you, and you
hurt my feelings,' ," she says. "And I hate to be corny, but I
totally do wish them well."</TE>

<HD>'Sobibor' Tells of Daring Escape From a WWII Death Camp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laemmle's current--and best--Documentary Days series concludes
with Claude Lanzmann's "Sobibor: October 14, 1943, 4 p.m.," an
important footnote to Lanzmann's great 9 1/2-hour Holocaust
documentary "Shoah" (1985).</LD>
<LD>   The story of the uprising and escape of Jews in the extermination
camp in Sobibor, Poland, is told through an interview with a key
participant, Yehuda Lerner, that Lanzmann filmed in 1979 for "Shoah."
He retraced Lerner's circuitous journey from the Warsaw Ghetto, as he
and a friend miraculously escape from eight camps before ending up in
Sobibor in 1943.</LD>
<LD>   In forthright fashion, Lerner relates how a Jewish Red Army
colonel devised a daring escape plan. Lerner was one of more than 300
who survived among the estimated 600 who escaped. At the time of the
making of this 2001 production, 47 were still living.</LD>
<TE>   "Sobibor" screens Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. at the Sunset 5,
West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500; Sept. 28-29 at 11 a.m. at the Monica
4-Plex, Santa Monica, (310) 394-9741; Oct. 5-6 at the Playhouse 7,
Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; and Oct. 12-13 at the Fallbrook, West
Hills, (818) 340-8710.</TE>

<TE>   Alex Nohe's "The Burning Sensation," which opens a regular run
Friday at the Fairfax Cinemas in L.A., documents a festival that
occurs every summer in the desert 90 miles north of Reno. About
25,000 people set up a tent city, where they participate in eight
days of self-expression, culminating in a ritual torching of the
Burning Man, a 50-foot wooden sculpture outlined in neon. Nohe
captures all the energy and creativity--and silliness and
nonsense--and reveals the event's overpowering atmosphere of freedom.
(323) 655-4010.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Bright's "Bundy," which begins a regular run Friday at the
Sunset 5, is a crisp and chilling study of the man for whom the term
"serial killer" was coined. Ted Bundy was arrested in 1978 and
ultimately confessed to killing more than 20 women before he was
executed in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Well-played by Michael Reilly Burke, Bundy grew up in poverty,
learning at age 5 that his sister was really his mother and, at 17,
that his father was not really his father. But can this background
and his girlfriend Lee's (Boti Ann Bliss) nagging be enough to set
off a rage-consumed serial killer?</TE>
<TE>   Bright takes an absurdist tone that suggests he may regard such
questions as beside the point. (323) 848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juan Luis Iborra and Yolanda Garcia Serrano's "KM,0" (Kilometer 0)
is a fast and funny Spanish comedy ideal for American theatrical
release and even a Hollywood remake. It screens Wednesday at 7:30
p.m. as part of Outfest's weekly series at the Village at Ed Gould
Plaza, 1125 N. McCadden Place (near Santa Monica Boulevard),
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   It takes its title from a sidewalk marker in Madrid's Puerta Del
Sol plaza from which all road travel in Spain is measured. Iborra and
Garcia Serrano imagine seven couples meeting each other at KM,0 at 6
p.m. on the hottest day of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most striking vignettes finds an elegant, neglected
wife (Concha Velasco) who makes a hot date with a handsome gigolo
(Jesus Cabrero), only to discover he may be the son she gave up in
her teens. The effervescent "KM,0" works up a fizz that rarely goes
flat. (213) 480-7089.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LACMA's "Le Grand Gabin--A Jean Gabin Retrospective" concludes
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. with two classics by two great directors: Max
Ophuls' "Le Plaisir" (1952) and Jean Renoir's "French Cancan" (1955).
In the 1950s, Jean Renoir returned to France to make "French Cancan,"
one of the most lighthearted films of his career. The film provided a
happy reunion of Renoir and Gabin, who plays a Paris music hall
proprietor who sees a revival of the cancan and the transforming of a
working-class Montmartre dance hall into the legendary Moulin Rouge
as his professional salvation. Its last 20 minutes are devoted to an
exuberant cancan. (323) 857-6010.</TE>

<DH>Artists, photographers and designers were asked to consider
the tomato as the subject of an art exhibit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA HUNDLEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some, the tomato may be just another fruit. Unassuming,
utilitarian, perfect for wedging between slices of bread and meat.
It's a quaint finale to the ubiquitous BLT, functional in both it's
solid and more liquid forms, as a blanketing for pasta or spread atop
hot dog or burger bun. For others, the tomato is art. Or at least the
inspiration for art.</LD>
<LD>   "The Art of The Tomato," which opens Saturday at BGH Gallery,
attempts to explore an everyday food in a completely unconventional
manner. Part marketing ploy and part support of the arts by pasta
sauce purveyors Bertolli, the exhibit features artists from around
the country interpreting the humble Lycopersicon esculentum in their
own distinct ways.</LD>
<LD>   "We've always seen the production of tomato sauce as an art form
in itself, so we came up with the idea of asking up-and-coming
artists across the nation to use the tomato as their inspiration,"
says Bertolli spokeswomen Sheila McCrace.</LD>
<TE>   Artists were asked to work within six categories (photography,
graphic design, painting, film, sculpture and mixed media ) and the
contest was judged by experts in these fields, among them Bettie Sue
Hertz, curator of the San Diego's Museum of Contemporary Art, Sandra
Brown, curator of photography for the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, and Terrence Brown, the Director of the Society of Illustrators.</TE>
<TE>   "I applied a professional standard to this," says Brown, who
oversaw the mixed-media category. "I looked for work with a certain
vitality to it, where the media didn't overwhelm the composition and
vice versa. I thought the contest was interesting. I think it's
important that a corporation sees the value to art, particularly as
it is applied to commerce."</TE>
<TE>   The bridging of art and big business is old news, Pop Art having
embraced the allegiance long ago with Warhol at the front of the
pack, incorporating everything from Brillo Pad boxes to Coca-Cola
bottles and even tomatoes (in his Campbell's Soup series) into his
work. Bertolli hopes to inspire this same embrace of the everyday
through their promotional contest, enlisting young artists to
translate the tomato into art, and subsequently that art into a some
savvy media marketing for the once lowly tomato.</TE>
<TE>   "It struck me as a really versatile competition," says Bruce
Warden, a Minnesota-based artist who was a mixed-media finalist. "I
liked the idea of working with such a simple theme, and it seemed to
me that a lot could be done. It left a lot of room for
interpretation."</TE>
<TE>   Danny Chun, an L.A.-based designer who just left an investment
banking job, was seeking to build an advertising portfolio and saw
the contest as the perfect opportunity. "I knew that 80 hours a week
and all the flaws of corporate America weren't exactly for me," says
Chun, who won in the graphic-design category, "and I thought this was
a great chance for experimentation. Making a tomato sauce company
into art was a wonderful challenge."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Bertolli's "Art of the Tomato" is a mix of opposite
elements-- creative motivation and corporate marketing. Food for the
starving artist, so to speak.</TE>
<TE>   "Many corporations do special juried theme competitions, some more
civilized than others," says Juror Terrence Brown, "but to give an
artist a subject like, 'It's just a tomato' and ask them to make
something of it, that's a novel idea."</TE>

<LD>Am still fuming over preshrunk punk, a generous way to describe
Saturday's Levi's Inland Invasion at Blockbuster Pavilion. With the
most ambitious lineup in punk rock's 25-year history, the fans were
finally gonna have their very own punk-rock Woodstock. Instead, they
got the great rock 'n' roll swindle. The maltreated fans appeared to
be an afterthought to what amounted to a corporate buyout of punk for
the day. Ownership has its privileges. I guess.... Maybe it felt so
wrong because only a week earlier we checked out the brand spanking
new Sprite Liquid Mix Tour at Verizon Wireless (!), a rap and punk
festival that proves, yes, we can just all get along, especially when
the audience is treated with respect. Got a chance to kick it with
Pharrell Williams of N.E.R.D., who was kicking it with Justin
Timberlake and cutie patootie Alyssa Milano. Timberlake was sporting
a "Work Sucks" hat. Don't it though.</LD>
<TE>   The Well in Hollywood turns 1 on Sunday, and Radiohead's Thom York
was turning girls on at the Hollywood bar when he popped in last
week. Creepy.... Wow, this sounds hot: On Wednesday, Zanzibar in
Santa Monica is hosting "Dulce," a new monthly night celebrating the
deep, deep roots of Latin music. Feel the burn..... Friday night,
Texas Terri headlines a Hollywood Sunset Free Clinic/Breast Cancer
benefit at the Derby in Los Feliz. Also on the bill is the Blare
Bitch Project, the new band from the radical Betty Blowtorch
guitarist, Blare N. Bitch.</TE>
<TE>   Underground favorite Deadlee--a hard-core gay Latin rapper--is
performing at the Crooked Bar in WeHo on Sunday. We hear he "is" the
smoking gun.... Looks like a hot bill tonight at Highland Grounds,
with Candypants, Sparkle*Jets U.K. and the Dons. And it's free. Also
on the menu tonight, the Wondermints at the Knitting Factory.</TE>
<TE>   The Pleasure Club brings its trashy swamp-town boogie to the Viper
Room on Oct. 2, and that powerhouse rap crew Jurassic 5 will be
strutting its stuff at the House of Blues in WeHo on Oct. 9.... Forty
Deuce/Deep owner Ivan Kane just debuted Plugged, a new Wednesday
night promotion at Deep which he's hosting with "L.A. Models." I'm so
sher.... This just in: The hot electroclash artist Miss Kittin is
scheduled to perform at the sixteen-fifty club in Hollywood on
Wednesday. Me-ow.</TE>

<HD>Spinning the Night Away, but Not With Your Usual DJs</HD>

<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gorgeous DJ in the mirrored chain halter and classic patchwork
mini smiles beneath her earphones, flirting subtly, even teasing the
crowd with the selection of her music. Blondie's "Heart of Glass"
follows Nelly's "Hot in Here," moving the partygoers at this romantic
Hollywood hideaway, Cafe Des Artistes, to dance.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that she's spinning CDs and not vinyl singles is the
first clue that this isn't a real DJ. In fact, she's a "non-DJ"; she
is actress Dominique Swain, who portrayed preteen temptress Dolores
Haze in the 1997 remake of "Lolita." Swain, 22, is one of many
intriguing Angelenos booked to create musical ambience at this old
California bungalow-turned-restaurant. Rose Apodaca Jones, the West
Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily, led off the series on Sept.
5. Swain agreed to play the second weekly night as a present to her
stylist and good friend, Oren Shepher, who was celebrating his 24th
birthday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is fantastic," says "Do," as her friends call her. "I've
never had control of a party like this before. It's such a chill
atmosphere."</LD>
<TE>   Hoping to attract a hipper crowd to his California-French
restaurant, owner Oliver De Mori hired People's Revolution to throw
the weekly parties. Nearly 300 people, mostly twenty-and
thirtysomething professionals, attended Swain's debut.</TE>
<TE>   Shepher, who is opening a Sunset Boulevard "Grace Kelly meets the
millennium" boutique next month, selected Swain's sexy Paco Rabanne
outfit. For himself, he chose diamonds and bondage gear and an Agent
Provocateur whip.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the correlation of tough and sexy, a little bit of sweet
and a little bit of salty," Shepher said and laughed while Swain and
her three sisters, Jennifer, Alexis and Chelse, picked the CDs.
Swain, a product of the digital revolution, didn't use turntables or
records , but a professional DJ is on hand every week to help.</TE>
<TE>   Next in the spinning lineup: freelance writer and television
correspondent Sally Horchow tonight; and Henry Eshelman, managing
director of BWR Public Relations and head of entertainment at Ogilvy
Public Relations Worldwide, next Thursday.</TE>

<DH>The Girly Freak Show hopes to deliver a message of
empowerment through comedic acts, dangerous stunts and erotic dance</DH>

<LD>A woman in a pink bouffant wig, latex bustier and matching miniskirt
walks up a ladder of swords with all the grace of a ballerina.
Moments later, enough volts of electricity are shot through her body
to light up a florescent bulb in her hand. She looks like some sort
of punk-rock Bride of Frankenstein.</LD>
<LD>   They call it the Girly Freak Show for a reason.</LD>
<LD>   Not your average nightclub fare, this performance art troupe is
providing an alternative to hip bars, thumping dance floors and live
music concerts by upping the ante in a new wave in entertainment: the
variety act.</LD>
<TE>   Founded by Slymenstra Hyman (a.k.a. Danielle Stampe), a former
member of the heavy-metal art band GWAR, the Girly Freak Show is a
mix of comedic spectacles, erotic dancing girls and death-defying
stunts.</TE>
<TE>   According to Stampe, the idea is to develop a strong female icon
from ancient acts as well as images found in literature and art. "I'm
really into those evil yet fascinating characters. To me they have an
underlying female empowerment," Stampe says.</TE>
<TE>   Stampe manifests these archetypes in characters that include
Spidora (a singing spider lady) and Slimy (a half-woman, half-snake
man-eater) and in dangerous circus-style stunts. During a recent
performance at California Institute of Abnormal Arts, those sitting
in front of the stage retreated as Stampe began blowing blasts of
fire.</TE>
<TE>   She has set a Guinness world record for fire breathing using a
circular breathing technique often practiced by dancers and horn
players. "You breathe in through your nose and blow out at the same
time," she explains. "I do something called Dragon's Breath that
rolls out in a three-tiered flame. It looks like a nuclear blast."</TE>
<TE>   Stampe set another record for highest human endurance of
high-voltage electricity with a Tesla coil stunt in which she sits
atop a huge electric generator and shoots lightning bolts from her
fingertips. "It's about 3 million volts of electricity running
through me. I've had lightning bolts shooting out about 12 to 13
feet," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Touring with GWAR for 15 years gave her the best training for this
type of show. The act was known for outrageous stage theatrics that
included everything from fake pagan rituals to spewing faux bodily
fluids on their audiences.</TE>
<TE>   The Girly Freak Show started as a side project for Stampe in 1995,
when she teamed up with New York performance artists known as the
Pain-Proof Rubber Girls, taking her GWAR character Slymenstra with
her. In the new show, Slymenstra clearly delves into her more "Girly"
side, working with such guest performers as the burlesque starlets
from the Velvet Hammer and Kit Kat Follies. "There's some bump and
grind in the show, just enough to pay homage to women who were brave
enough to do that when it was completely unaccepted," she says.</TE>
<TE>   One regular in the Girly Freak Show is the self-proclaimed "Girly
Man," Tim Cridland, a former member of the Jim Rose Circus (also
known as Zamora the Torture King), whose stunts include licking
red-hot pokers, walking on broken glass and piercing his skin with
skewers. He and Stampe have worked with touring circus acts including
P.T. Barnum.</TE>
<TE>   Both agree that while circus-style theater has been reduced to
obscurity in the last few decades, it's steadily making a comeback.
"After being in rock 'n' roll for so long, it's time to see something
besides music," Stampe says. "I think a lot of people are feeling
that way."</TE>
<TE>   Though Stampe and Cridland are serious about the stunts,
ultimately the show's goal is to provide a little tongue-in-cheek
humor. Stampe laughs and says, "How can you take yourself seriously
in a five-foot bouffant wig."</TE>

<HD>A World Away From the '50s</HD>
<DH>Burger-joint touches of nostalgia remain, but Thai dishes
rule at the Asian-food hangout Noodle Planet</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAX JACOBSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You want a symbol of our changing demographics? Behold the head of
the Big Boy, symbol of the Bob's hamburger hangouts of the '50s,
sticking out of the wall at Noodle Planet like a 21st century
Ozymandias.</LD>
<LD>   Noodle Planet's Thai-Chinese owners have kept the Big Boy as a
reminder of what Alhambra used to be like. When I moved there in the
late '80s, it still had some coffee shops and lots of Mexican places.
Today, Valley Boulevard is solidly lined with Chinese, Thai, Korean
and Vietnamese restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   And now you can you get a medley of Asian cuisines right here,
right under the Big Boy's cheerful eye.</LD>
<TE>   A generation ago this was a thriving teenage hot spot. It still
is, packed morning to night with young bohemian types of Asian
descent who've come to feast on Asian pastas and boba drinks, those
fruit smoothies and ice-blended drinks with giant pearls of tapioca
dancing in them. Big sellers include the taro smoothie (better than
it sounds), a coffee caramel milkshake and litchi cooler, made with
fresh litchi fruit, juice and Jell-O. And, yes, lots of boba.</TE>
<TE>   If you order a boba drink, you'll get it in a specially designed
plastic cup with a foil top. The straw, which is about half an inch
in diameter to accommodate the boba balls, has an angled edge for
punching through the foil. Don't drink too fast, or you'll get an ice
cream headache.</TE>
<TE>   Noodle Planet has the worn look of, well, an old burger joint.
There are long booths and an endless counter, and a huge American
flag is stuck to the ceiling. Every table has a tray of Southeast
Asian condiments: fish sauce, red pepper flakes, crushed peanuts and
a jar of sinister-looking hot green chiles in vinegar.</TE>
<TE>   All the dishes are tasty, but you won't be surprised that the Thai
dishes are just a little better than the rest of the menu (which is
written, by the way, in English, Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai). And
it isn't all noodles, either, although the noodle dishes tend to be
the menu stars.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite dish is beef panang spaghetti: tender beef chunks in a
penetrating curry sauce on al dente spaghetti--more or less a Thai
take on spaghetti bolognese. Another good one is spicy yakisoba,
buckwheat noodles turned in a wok with chiles, garlic, mushrooms,
carrots, tomatoes and basil.</TE>
<TE>   For those who like Japanese noodles, there are credible twists on
ramen and udon, both in good, hearty broths. Udon tom yum, for
instance, is thick Japanese noodles in a huge bowl of soup flavored
Thai-fashion with lemon grass, lime juice and the ginger-like spice
galangal.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of customers are ordering pho, that Vietnamese meal in a
bowl. What makes a good pho isn't the soup's long, spindly noodles
but the integrity of the homemade beef stock. Noodle Planet's is
superb, as good as you can get at almost any pho joint in Little
Saigon. Noodle Planet pho (No. 46 on the menu) gives you the works:
steak, flank steak, beef tendon, tripe, beef meatballs, peanuts and
fresh red chile.</TE>
<TE>   But Thai dishes rule, and not necessarily the Thai noodle dishes.
Thai wings are chicken wings stuffed with a mixture of finely minced
chicken, bean thread noodles and black mushroom, as subtle as a
French galantine. Thai-style roast duck (boneless strips, complete
with skin, on rice) is basically Chinese roast duck varied with hints
of lemon grass and mint.</TE>
<TE>   All in all, there are 125 dishes on the menu, pretty much spanning
eastern Asia. They include a fairly traditional, perfectly executed
Thai mint-leaf chicken and a delicious Thai beef salad, dressed with
enough lime juice to make your mouth pucker.</TE>
<TE>   I can also recommend the fusion-ish chicken satay hand rolls,
which have slices of green apple and rice vermicelli inside the rice
paper (they're eaten with a rich, sweet peanut butter dip) and the
Thai street dish papaya salad with salted crab (som tam).</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, I haven't had a single bad dish in this restaurant,
except for that overcooked double cheeseburger.</TE>
<TE>   Come on, I'm kidding.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Liftoff on Imax</HD>
<DH>'Apollo 13' reopens Friday, this time on the gigantic
screen, an attempt to bring more mainstream films to the format.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching "Apollo 13" in Imax (opening Friday), you'd think that Ron
Howard's 1995 movie about the heroic rescue of three NASA astronauts
on an aborted mission to the moon was made for the giant format.</LD>
<LD>   It's not only the sharpness and clarity of the increased film
image (10 times the size of the frame of conventional 35-millimeter
film and three times that of conventional 70-millimeter film) and how
it's projected on the enormous Imax screen (ranging from 70 feet wide
by 52 feet high to as large as 120 feet by 90 feet), but also the way
in which the sense of drama, intimacy and spectacle are enhanced.</LD>
<LD>   From the exhilarating liftoff to the claustrophobic anxiety of Tom
Hanks, Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon, from the intense mission control
maneuvers led by Ed Harris to the deeply moving close-ups of Kathleen
Quinlan as Hanks' wife and the miraculous landing and recovery of the
capsule, this is not the same "Apollo 13" we've experienced. Nor is
it the same Imax.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to the company's new $2.5-million system called digital
remastering, or as Imax calls it, DMR, "Apollo 13" is the first
35-millimeter live-action feature to be digitally repurposed in the
large-screen format. This breakthrough takes the commercial
film-going experience to a new level. That's right: film.</TE>
<TE>   Even George Lucas, Mr. Digital Cinema, is so impressed that he's
agreed that "Attack of the Clones" will be the next feature to
undergo digital remastering. "Episode II" in the "Star Wars" saga
opens Nov. 1 in Imax theaters. It's part of a strategy to take Imax
into the more profitable and prestigious mainstream, beyond the
institutions and theaters that play "T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous"
or "Space Station" and beyond the animated experiments with such
Disney features as "Fantasia/2000," "Beauty and the Beast" and "The
Lion King" (opening Dec. 25).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "This has been an ongoing process for the past five years, and
it's only been in the last nine months that we've obtained the
software breakthrough to make 'Apollo 13' work," says Brad Wechsler,
co-chairman of Imax with Richard Gelfond.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the perfect Imax feature emotionally and aesthetically. What
we've been doing since then is knocking on a number of doors at the
studios and with directors to show them the results of DMR. Their
response has been, 'Well, let's see how our franchise films work.'
And they've given us the most difficult scenes to repurpose, and
we've taken their best shots."</TE>
<TE>   Except in one instance. Imax tried running a snippet of "The
Wizard of Oz" through the digital remastering process and found that
it couldn't remove enough grain from the 1939 classic to have it work
effectively Imax-size.</TE>
<TE>   Wechsler credits Greg Foster, Imax's president of filmed
entertainment and a former production and marketing executive at
MGM/UA, with cultivating closer ties with the Hollywood creative
community and landing both "Apollo 13" and "Attack of the Clones." In
addition, Imax recently signed an agreement with CAA to help
negotiate releases of new movies for digital remastering.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you imagine the next 'Matrix' or 'Harry Potter' in Imax?"
Wechsler asks.</TE>
<TE>   Profitability remains to be seen, but Wechsler contends the
process would add a new revenue window and help differentiate the
film-going experience, even among event films. Meanwhile, "Apollo 13"
and "Attack of the Clones" will play in about 22 commercial Imax
theaters and at various institutions.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so blown away by the ['Apollo 13'] test that [producer]
Brian [Grazer] and I were delighted but skeptical," says Howard. "I
wasn't sure the film would work on such an immense scale. It was shot
with a lot of detail, camera movement and close-ups--all no-no's if
you look at the Imax playbook.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a fan of Imax for more than 10 years but, as a
director, I wanted to make sure that the process enhanced the film
experience for the audience. I was surprised by how well the
performance and close-ups worked. It reminds you how fortunate I was
to have such a good cast. Everything is going on with those eyes.
Honesty is imperative when you come under a greater microscope.
Looking at Kathleen Quinlan's eyes during the launch sequence to me
was more impressive than watching the launch itself. I sat there and
realized that I had unintentionally made an Imax film."</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted, though, that because of the physical amount of
film involved, Imax is not yet capable of handling movies longer than
two hours, so Howard had to edit his film for the Imax experience,
trimming about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Howard says he and editor Dan Hanley "in some instances came up
with what I thought were better edits of scenes."</TE>
<TE>   Grazer agreed that Imax intensified the experience of watching
"Apollo 13." "The relationships became more life-and-death. It became
more of a roller-coaster ride.</TE>
<TE>   "What's interesting is that this becomes the third chapter in the
history of this film. First the movie came out and exceeded all of
our expectations because we weren't sure there would be enough
suspense, given that you know they don't make it to the moon. Then
came the HBO anthology, 'From the Earth to the Moon,' that Tom
[Hanks] spearheaded with our Imagine Films. And now this Imax
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Will Grazer release the upcoming "Cat in the Hat" in Imax? "I'm
open to the possibility, but we would have to check off all the boxes
to make sure it's a good fit."</TE>
<TE>   Even Hanks went in skeptical but was immediately wowed by the
test. ""The image was so clear that I lost my sense of that big
canvas. It was otherworldly. I'd like to see something less grandiose
and scientific in Imax, like 'GoodFellas.' Or 'O Brother, Where Art
Thou?' Could you imagine the Coen brothers in Imax?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Digitally converting "Apollo 13" and outputting it back to film
wasn't easy. First the engineers had to remove the artifacts and
extraneous grain, then reconfigure the remaining grain so that it
looked natural. At the same time, they had to sharpen the edges and
correct the color to accommodate the larger size and higher
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "Attack of the Clones" provided a different technical challenge,
because it already existed in digital form. "There was no grain but
electronic artifacts [visual 'noise' that had to be cleaned up] in
repurposing the digital file," says Brian Bonnick, Imax's senior vice
president of technology.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ward, Lucasfilm's vice president of marketing, believes Imax
will provide a completely new experience for "Star Wars" fans. "It's
going to be a new sensation seeing the incredible battle sequences up
on that Imax screen and that incredible fight at the end, where Yoda
kicks butt."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Poker without gambling is like sex--sex without orgasm."</LD>
<LD>   This least shocking of the epigrams bankrolling Patrick Marber's
"Dealer's Choice" calls the textual ante, and the enthralling revival
at Third Stage in Burbank parlays the balance into a riotous inside
straight.</LD>
<LD>   Marber's 1995 debut play, first seen locally at the Mark Taper
Forum in 1998, is marked by beginner's luck, drawing allusions to
Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Though debatable, such analogies
accrue credit from Marber's firsthand understanding of compulsive
betting.</LD>
<TE>   The game transpires in a London bistro, its dining room, kitchen
and eventually basement slickly realized by Danny Cistone's
split-focus sets. The employees prepare for work while discussing the
weekly poker night commandeered by proprietor Stephen (Alan Safier).</TE>
<TE>   Headwaiter Mugsy (producer James Henriksen) and chef Sweeney (Rich
Hutchman), both owing the boss a bundle, reveal divergent stratagems.
Sweeney's mate Frankie (Steven Sanpietro) anticipates winning his
exit to Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The wild card is Stephen's son Carl (Caleb Martin), agitated for
vested reasons. Then, closing patron Ash (Dick DeCoit) raises the
stakes, subsequently trumped by the metaphoric showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Director David Blanchard shuffles the exchanges with bluff
assurance. The technical effort is top notch, with dialect coach
Linda Brennan pulling sly regional variants from the cast.</TE>
<TE>   Henriksen's rubber mug is ideal for joker Mugsy, as Martin's
Edward Norton quality suits Carl. Hutchman and Sanpietro smartly
husband their resources, and Safier and DeCoit are spot-on in their
roles.</TE>
<TE>   By expertly stacking the deck, "Dealer's Choice" deals a royal
flush, for its players are all aces.</TE>

<HD>Diversity and Clarity From Kenny Rankin</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenny Rankin's career has always been somewhat shadowed by the
question of categories. What kind of performer is he? Where, in a
business obsessed with categories and pigeon-holing, should he be
placed?</LD>
<LD>   Some see him as a jazz artist; others as a singer-songwriter; and
still others as a guitar-playing, folk-derived pop act. And the fact
is--as with the late Eva Cassidy--all those labels apply. On Tuesday
night at the Jazz Bakery, Rankin underscored that multi-stylistic
perspective with a solo performance in which he sang to the sole
accompaniment of his own guitar. Most of the numbers traced to his
recently released Verve debut album, "A Song for You," with the
addition of a few familiar items from the past--notably his unique
reworking of Lennon and McCartney's "Blackbird."</LD>
<LD>   The central element in all the songs--whether he was singing
Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields' golden classic, "The Way You Look
Tonight," Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector's "Spanish Harlem" or
Thelonious Monk and Cootie Williams' " 'Round Midnight"--was the
sweet clarity of Rankin's sound. Moving easily from a chesty baritone
into seemingly effortless high notes, he invested each with an
quality that was infinitely appealing. Add to that a sense of rhythm
flowing with buoyant jazz swing.</LD>
<TE>   His guitar playing, a bit stiff in his first two or three numbers,
eventually relaxed into a persuasive linkage with his voice,
sometimes supporting with rhythmic vamps, sometimes moving in and
around his soaring vocal lines.</TE>
<TE>   Explaining that he was performing as a solo act on Tuesday and
Thursday and would be joined by a jazz trio for his Friday through
Sunday dates at the Bakery, Rankin noted that his Tuesday
opening-night audience was hearing his music--and, especially, the
songs from the new album--in the blueprint form that eventually led
to more fully orchestrated versions.</TE>
<TE>   He was correct in that regard, and there was enormous value in
hearing the material in that manner, in the sort of pristine
rendering that emerges from the pure interface of voice and solo
guitar.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When my 3-year-old watches the Food Channel, Emeril's gestures, the
chef's phraseology and his obvious abilities in the kitchen mesmerize
my son. "Can we make that? I want to make an enchilada!"</LD>
<LD>   Though we have yet to make an enchilada, we nightly whip together
vinaigrette; he spoons in the mustard, I press the garlic, we squeeze
the lemon (his hand on top of mine), and so our evening ritual goes.
He looks forward to it, as I do, and each evening he tells me how
delicious it tastes, and how pleased he is with our accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that your child can learn about cooking and safety in
your own kitchen. But what happens when they are interested and
you're not, or their passion for food preparation far exceeds yours,
or they just want to learn more? The answer is simple: cooking
classes, which are offered for kids and teens all over Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Each program has its own approach. Though all of them divide the
classes according to age, which may vary a year or two on either
side; most begin at around 6 years old and go right up to 16. The
classes are relatively small, never exceeding about 20 students per
class, which keeps the group manageable and gives the teacher time to
focus on each student.</TE>
<TE>   The curriculums differ widely. Some are quite sophisticated,
asking the group to prepare regional four-course meals from top to
bottom using easy-to-follow, scaled-down adult recipes. Others theme
the cuisine, like those offered at Bristol Farms in Manhattan Beach
with classes like "A Halloween Fiesta" for kids and "Spooky Taco
Night" for teens. There are also classes which blend popular culture
with food preparation like Let's Get Cookin's parent-child Harry
Potter Workshop and the Comic Book Super Hero cooking classes.
Phyllis Vaccarelli ,director of Let's Get Cookin', finds that it's a
wonderful activity for parents and children to do together: "It makes
them slow down and enjoy each other, and both of them end up learning
so much."</TE>
<TE>   Top Chefs Have Class</TE>
<TE>   Well-known chefs have been going into classrooms for years. Chefs
such as Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger (of Border Grill and
Ciudad) participate in outreach programs in area schools in which
they instruct kids about cooking.</TE>
<TE>   One of their most popular classes teaches children how to make
their own flour tortillas, which they then turn into melted-cheese
quesadillas.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally they offer this class on the patio at the Border
Grill in Santa Monica, and this year they had more than 45 kids
between the ages of 6 and 12 sign up. "The key is to give them
ownership of projects," Milliken says. "It's important for them to
discover things. You give them the tools, techniques and a few ideas
and let them do it themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Miller of Joe's in Venice has been going into his own
children's classrooms two to three times a month for six years. He
likes to blend simple cooking classes with their current area of
study; recently he prepared egg foo yong when they were studying
Asia. In fact, he's accumulated so many recipes from his visits that
he's putting together a book for the kids he's taught over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's the responsibility of thinking through a process and
seeing it come to fruition quickly that makes so many chefs and
teachers agree that cooking classes are a great confidence builder.
It can be a place to learn a whole host of important lessons, some
related to food, some related to functioning in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Life Skills Learned</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Moore, children's cooking teacher at both Bristol Farms
in Manhattan Beach and Sur La Table in Santa Monica, explains: "It's
a good experience for them because it's not just about cooking. It's
a process of thinking, working together, directing others, using
their math skills, learning about food safety and food allergies. It
also involves making mistakes and finding out why. These are not just
kitchen skills, these are life skills."</TE>
<TE>   And she added, "To see them taste delicious food they've made
themselves, you can tell how proud they are!"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>* His portrayal of Federico Diaz, the ultra-cool uber-embalmer on
HBO's "Six Feet Under," has earned him an Emmy nomination.</LD>
<LD>   See Shells, Seashells: I'm a simple guy. I don't do the young
Hollywood thing--the clubs, things like that. Any chance I get, I
like to be outdoors. We like to take the kids to Marina del Rey and
just walk down the pier and watch the boats go by. There's a beach
nearby that has this huge variety of seashells. We go over there and
my kids--a 7-and a 4-year-old--love collecting seashells with their
dad. Then we'll have some lunch at the Marina.</LD>
<LD>   Hitting the Trail: Some weekends we ride bikes--I put a hitch on
the back of the car and we go riding. We live in Woodland Hills, but
we like to ride the Santa Monica to Venice trail. We start off in
Santa Monica, ride down to Venice, get a $1.50 slice of pizza, then
get on our bikes and ride back.</LD>
<TE>   Night Life, Medium Rare: It's a miracle when we can find a
baby-sitter--all of my family's in Chicago-- but when we do, it's
dinner and a movie. I really like going to the Cinerama Dome in
Hollywood. It's so nice to go and see a movie in such a classy place.
You can have dinner there; they have a full restaurant there in the
ArcLight complex, then, when you're walking across the plaza to see
the movie, there are bands that play.</TE>
<TE>   Tropical Steak: And for the best food in town, I like to go to
this place that's like this little hole in the wall, called La Fonda;
it's on Western and Melrose. It's a Colombian restaurant--John
Leguizamo took me there back in '97, and I've been going ever since.
We get the same thing every time; it's a dish they call the tropical
steak. It's sliced real thin, then comes with this chunky sauce. The
place may look like a little house on the outside, but inside there's
all the seating and this great food!</TE>

<LD>   Dexter's Laboratory: The Hip-Hop Experiment. Rhino. CD: $7.98.
Ages 5 to 12. http://www.rhino.com</LD>
<LD>   Cartoon Network's star boy genius, Dexter, his pain-in-the-neck
sister Didi and his rival Mandark are the inspirations for six
original hip-hop songs, slickly produced and guaranteed to send
droves of parents up the wall. The songs (mixed up in Dexter's secret
lab), from stars Coolio, De La Soul, Prince Paul, Phife Diggy,
will.i.am and YZ, include "Dexter (What's His Name?)," "Love
According to Dexter," "Mandark's Plan," "Sibling Rivalries,"
"Secrets" and "Back to the Lab."</LD>

<TE>   Celebration of America. Music for Little People. CD: $15.98;
Cassette: $9.98. All ages. (800) 346-4445; http://www.mflp.com</TE>
<TE>   This eclectic tapestry of Broadway and rock 'n' roll, country,
zydeco, folk and classical renditions of songs weaves a stirring
tribute to America "from sea to shining sea." Among the 14
well-chosen tracks are Randy Newman's poignant "Follow the Flag," Ray
Charles' bluesy "Swanee River Rock," and Paul Robeson's thrilling
rendition of "Old Man River."</TE>
<TE>   The album ends on an orchestral uplift: "The Battle Hymn of the
Republic" with the American Philharmonic, and "America the Beautiful"
with the National Philharmonic.</TE>

<HD>MTV, Public Enemy at Loggerheads</HD>
<DH>MTV won't air video with lyric about Mumia Abu-Jamal. The
rappers refuse to delete the phrase.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>MTV has declined to air a new video by the rap group Public Enemy
unless the group agrees to excise a lyric advocating the release of
convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death row inmate whose case
has been debated across the globe.</LD>
<LD>   The new song "Gotta Give the Peeps What They Need" contains the
phrase "free Mumia," which an MTV spokeswoman on Tuesday said was too
political to be included in the channel's playlist.</LD>
<LD>   "We asked if they could take out the word 'free,' not the name
mentioned," the spokeswoman said. "We felt it was a personal and
political position on an individual and we are an unbiased company.
We asked them to resubmit the video without the word 'free.' "</LD>
<TE>   The move may be an unprecedented one for MTV, which is perhaps the
single most powerful tastemaker for U.S. music consumers and reaches
78 million households.</TE>
<TE>   The station routinely returns videos to music labels asking for
edits of content deemed too sexual, violent or crude, but the
spokeswoman said she could think of no past example of an edit
request based on political speech.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck D, leader of the seminal rap group, said he would never
kowtow on political principle in his music.</TE>
<TE>   "I do art and songs to provoke and not to be a joke," he said in a
statement Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Although Public Enemy has not been a commercial force in recent
years, the group is credited as a pioneer of political content in the
genre with memorable tracks such as "Fight the Power."</TE>
<TE>   Abu-Jamal is the former Black Panther and journalist whose 1981
conviction and subsequent death sentence for the murder of a
Philadelphia police officer has been a hotly charged issue for years.</TE>
<TE>   It has become a cause celebre in the music world too, with
musicians such as Rage Against the Machine, the Beastie Boys and Bad
Religion staging benefit concerts and advocating a new trial for
Abu-Jamal.</TE>

<LD>* Ruben Blades, "Mundo," Columbia. Every decade or so, this
ever-inventive artist makes a milestone album. This is a sweeping,
occasionally breathtaking work that ties together the diverse musical
strains he's explored for decades while moving far beyond anything
he's done before. All the elements that have made Blades so appealing
and inspiring are here: the imaginative storytelling, the rousing
social vision, the true-grit rhythms and memorable melodies. Blades
demonstrates that all music comes from a common source, like the
humans who make it.</LD>

<LD>* New this week: "Spring Forward," Tom Gilroy's beautifully realized
debut feature, charts a father-and-son relationship between two parks
and recreation department employees in an idyllic Connecticut
community to reveal the value of friendship between men in an
increasingly indifferent and self-absorbed society. A subtle
depiction of the changing of the seasons suggests the constant
passing of time and the eternal cycle of life. This modest, intimate
film was among 2000's best, and Ned Beatty and Liev Schreiber give
two of that year's best performances. "Spring Forward" leaves one
with that rarest of feelings: a heightened awareness of the human
capacity for good.</LD>

<HD>An Edge at the Emmys</HD>
<DH>Television* Voters look for emotional range and impact, but
the only sure thing is unpredictability.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM O'NEIL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't write off Bernie Mac as one of those stand-up comics such as
Jerry Seinfeld or Ellen DeGeneres who can't win an Emmy for acting.
And don't dismiss the serious acting chops of "Alias" star Jennifer
Garner just because she knows some sexy martial arts moves.</LD>
<LD>   Both stars are among longshot nominees who could appear at the
Emmy podium Sunday, if for no other reason than they were savvy--or
lucky--enough to pick samples of their work from the past TV season
that spotlight qualities Emmy voters prefer.</LD>
<LD>   An analysis of recent voting patterns shows that judges gravitate
toward performances with two key elements: emotional range and
impact. Comedy or drama doesn't matter; mixing the two elements are
key to winning. A third factor is face time; actors need to be front
and center, which is one reason an ensemble show like "Friends" has
never produced a lead actor or actress Emmy.</LD>
<TE>   That said, it's worth noting that upsets are routine at the
Emmys--more so than other show-biz awards--because of a unique voting
system. Contenders are given a guarantee not made to nominees for
Oscars, Grammys and Tonys: Their work will be evaluated by all voters
(see related story, page 56). It means sentiment and promotion tend
to play less of a role in Emmy voting than for the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the difficulty in predicting winners is that this is
only the third year for the current voting system. The Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences changed its rules three years ago,
eliminating screenings of nominated shows and instead allowing
academy members to watch tapes at home. It increased the number of
participating members dramatically, and may have altered some voting
patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Now, seemingly low-key performers such as "Everybody Loves
Raymond's" Patricia Heaton not only have a real shot at topping
super-chic foes such as "Sex and the City's" Sarah Jessica Parker,
but they do it often, as Heaton demonstrated ... twice.</TE>
<TE>   This year Heaton could win for a third year in a row on the
strength of her latest sample episode. Like her past two victorious
entries, "A Vote for Debra" has emotional range and impact. Heaton
handles the spectrum from laughs to tears as she campaigns for
president of her kids' school governing board. When she loses, she
finds out that her husband didn't vote for her. "How could you do
that to me?" she roars at him, appearing wounded and betrayed. "I'm
your wife! I don't care if my platform is anti-puppy, you have to
vote for me!"</TE>
<TE>   Impact without range is the mistake Emmy nominees often make,
according to a survey of TV journalists who've scrutinized the Emmy
contests for the last five years. It's probably one of the reasons
Parker lost to Heaton last year. Parker opted for a darkly dramatic
episode that didn't include her light comic skills.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, Parker's submission, "The Real Me," is funny
(Parker is forced to wear skimpy underwear when she agrees to be a
fashion-show model) and tragic (she falls on the runway).</TE>
<TE>   Heaton and Parker face a formidable foe in Jennifer Aniston, who
submitted the season finale of "Friends," which gives her two
advantages: a baby (Emmy voters love performances with kids) and an
hourlong episode to compete against half-hour rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The one-hour advantage doesn't always work (Debra Messing's
hourlong "Will &amp; Grace" special lost last year to Heaton's half-hour
"Raymond"), but Helen Hunt won two of her four Emmys for one-hour
entries, one of them featuring a newborn.</TE>
<TE>   Less clear in Aniston's case is what role sentiment may play; this
upcoming season is expected to be the show's last, and voters may
feel it's time to give it an Emmy in a lead performer category (Lisa
Kudrow has won a supporting actress award).</TE>
<TE>   The face-time factor could play a particularly key role in the
race for lead actor in a comedy, which seems to be between Matt
LeBlanc ("Friends") and Bernie Mac ("The Bernie Mac Show"), both of
whom submitted what appear to be formidable episodes. LeBlanc's role
as the ditzy Joey may have hurt his Emmy chances previously, but the
actor displays a range of angst, joy, relief and heartache as he
confesses his secret, doomed love to Rachel (Aniston).</TE>
<TE>   Still, even with his expanded role last season, LeBlanc has only
one-third the screen time on his submitted episode that Mac wielded
in his self-titled series as he tries to dodge a cold virus. Mac
dominates every scene, going from grumpy one minute to silly the
next.</TE>
<TE>   In the same way, Garner towers over rivals in the lead actress in
a drama category. She's at the center of every scene in the "Alias"
debut episode, which builds slowly, revealing a sensitive actress
coping with the murder of a lover and betrayals of a father. Then she
comes out swinging as an action hero.</TE>
<TE>   But Garner's up against an award foe who's never lost an Emmy
race, "The West Wing's" Allison Janney, in the lead drama actress
category after two wins in the supporting race. Janney rages against
the injustices against women in an Arab nation allied to the U.S.,
but her role doesn't have as much muscle as Garner's. Janney has only
a few--albeit pointed--scenes in her episode. Frances Conroy doesn't
have much screen time in her's either--the "Six Feet Under" pilot--in
which she collapses on the floor next to her dropped veal roast when
she learns her husband has died.</TE>
<TE>   Kiefer Sutherland's response to the death of his TV wife could
lead to an action hero carrying the day in the competition for lead
actor in a drama. That he already won a Golden Globe for "24" could
give him a head start. Michael Chiklis opted for the same adrenaline
pace by submitting the pilot of "The Shield," but it reveals no
tender heart inside a tough-guy shell.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Krause's episode of "Six Feet Under" doesn't have such
explosive impact, but it shows range as he berates a blockhead
doctor, comforts his depressed lover, duels with his father's ghost
and gets looped on Ecstasy.</TE>
<TE>   Co-star Michael C. Hall's tape, by contrast, is less flamboyant.
After wrestling quietly with his homosexuality for most of the
episode, he lets loose near the end, dropping to his knees and
shouting "Please God, help me! Take this pain away!"</TE>
<TE>   It may have the range and the impact voters love. Or not.
Unpredictability makes the Emmys unique among major award shows.</TE>

<HD>Behind the Secrets of Emmy Award Voting: An Honor System</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom O'Neil</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Emmy Award voting is different in one key way from the process used
to select Oscar, Grammy and Tony winners: Voters must weigh a sample
of every nominee's work before deciding each category.</LD>
<LD>   In the Oscar contest, that restriction applies only to such
specialty categories as foreign-language film and documentaries. At
the Emmys, it applies to all categories.</LD>
<LD>   Voters are restricted to participating in only four categories
related to their peer group (actors on actors, writers on writers,
etc.) so they're not overloaded with too many videotapes. All members
of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences can vote for the best
comedy, drama, movie and miniseries categories.</LD>
<TE>   In the series competitions, actors submit one episode as a sample
of their best work; supporting stars submit two. Producers of series
nominated for best drama or comedy submit eight episodes
(approximately one-third of the TV season), which are divided into
four sets of two episodes each.</TE>
<TE>   The sets are distributed randomly to voters, who view both samples
of each of the five shows nominated. In the writing and directing
categories, specific episodes are nominated, so voters evaluate
those.</TE>
<TE>   All voters must sign affidavits attesting that they've viewed
everything when they submit their ballots. It's an honor system, but
one that seems to be holding, and it certainly expanded the number of
academy members who vote; the total this year was triple what it was
just before the new rules were imposed for the 2000 contest.</TE>
<TE>   This year 5,700 of the 11,000 members of the Academy of Television
Arts &amp; Sciences chose Emmy winners in 86 categories after viewing
37,000 VHS tapes.</TE>

<LD>They were known as the royal family of the American theater. That
must explain the tabloid-like treatment they get from A&amp;E's
"Biography" tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Just like the gossip hounds who make careers exposing the private
lives behind the British throne, "The Barrymores" concerns itself
almost exclusively with the personal traumas that have beset a U.S.
acting dynasty stretching back more than a century--from Maurice and
Georgie Drew Barrymore through their children Lionel, Ethel and John
to their great-granddaughter Drew.</LD>
<LD>   The two-hour program (8 p.m., A&amp;E) offers no interviews, no
insight--just a chronology of calamity, recounted in overwrought
style by narrator Gary Sinise, who comes away with more screen time
than some of the family members.</LD>
<TE>   Admittedly, the Barrymores' lives are melodramatic to the max:
alcoholism, infidelity, early deaths, financial hardship, divorce,
drug addiction, even madness. But they gained their fame as artists,
and writer-director Keith Clarke makes no attempt to explore the
source of their talent or how it passed from one generation to the
next. The result is an incomplete, unsatisfying viewing experience.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the production of the Pixar-Disney computer-animated hit,
"Monsters, Inc.," director Pete Doctor and co-directors David
Silverman and Lee Unkrich were already thinking about the extras they
wanted to include on the DVD.</LD>
<LD>   The sweet comedy is set in a hidden city where scaring kids is the
only way to provide power to the metropolis. John Goodman is the
voice of the top scare-master at Monsters Inc., a big, furry, blue
monster named Sulley, and Billy Crystal provides the yuks as Mike,
his one-eyed green assistant.</LD>
<LD>   Pixar has a great track record when it comes to the DVD editions
of its films, having produced state-of-the-art discs for both "Toy
Story" and "A Bug's Life."</LD>
<TE>   "Every time we saw something really cool during production, we
would tag it and mark it in some way," Doctor says. "Then at the end,
when the film was done, we came back to all of that stuff and
thought, 'What would be really cool?' "</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set of "Monsters, Inc." (Disney, $30) won't
disappoint the film's legion of fans. One of the most enjoyable
extras is a new animated short starring Sulley and Mike called
"Mike's New Car." The idea to add it came from executive producer
John Lasseter; Doctor retooled a short story he'd conceived long ago
about a guy who got a new car.</TE>
<TE>   Available in either wide-screen or full screen, the discs also
include commentary by the filmmakers; the Oscar-winning 2001 Pixar
short, "For the Birds"; a look at computer animation work; a
read-along story book; animation gags; abandoned concepts and funny
outtakes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen are writers, stars and
co-producers of "Kissing Jessica Stein" (Fox, $30). The charming
romantic comedy deals with two straight New York career women who
become lovers.</TE>
<TE>   The entertaining DVD contains deleted scenes (a few of which are
really funny), outtakes, a passable featurette and two commentary
tracks: one with the two stars and the second featuring director
Charles Herman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Paxton ("Aliens," "Apollo 13") makes his directorial debut
with the creepy but effective psychological thriller "Frailty" (Lions
Gate, $25). Paxton plays a widower with two young sons who tells his
children one night that he had a vision from God ordering him to
purge the world of "demons."</TE>
<TE>   The digital edition includes a "making of" mini-documentary, an
episode of the Sundance Channel's "Anatomy of a Scene," the
obligatory deleted scenes with commentary from Paxton, and some
storyboards. There are commentary tracks from Paxton, producers David
Kirshner, writer Brent Hanley, composer Brian Tiler and editor Arnold
Glassman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the best movies to come out of the '70s--the last golden
era of Hollywood filmmaking--is Robert Altman's "The Long Goodbye"
(MGM, $20). Released in 1973, it is based on the Raymond Chandler
mystery of the same name and features a wry performance by Elliott
Gould as the rumpled gumshoe Philip Marlowe. Equally terrific is
Sterling Hayden as a drunken writer and Mark Rydell as a violent
gangster.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a comprehensive documentary with interviews with
the always-entertaining Altman and Gould and another featurette with
cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.</TE>

<HD>Assembling a Fun-Loving Show at Ojai's Childress Gallery</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The fine, although necessarily coarse, art of assembling artworks
from "found" objects is on display at the Childress Gallery through
this month.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibition title has a French accent, going by the established
art-world term "Assemblage," and there are moments of seriousness
along the way. Primarily, though, the going is easy, with funk and
fluff presiding. Lighthearted humor and rough edges abound.</LD>
<LD>   Jan Sanchez, also the show's curator, mixes her media with her wit
and skill, as in her "A" chair, a metal seat cradling a neon "A."
Function and language converge. Other artists veer off into private
directions. Lucy Harvey strings broken bottlenecks together into a
dangerous decorative object. Allison Lee mixes skeleton-like lovers
and a heart in her metal sculpture. Michael Flechtner deftly blends
skateboard parts, a metal frame and playful bear imagery in a
mock-shrine.</LD>
<TE>   Self-portraits by Sylvia Raz and Walt Rogge similarly cast the
artists as mixed-media fiends who find themselves in objects they
collect and connect, but the works follow different tacks. Rogge's
work is a wooden structure tripling as empty head, art supply holder
and dispenser of firecrackers, awaiting fire (like an artist awaiting
the muse?).</TE>
<TE>   Raz, a mainstay of the annual Ojai Studio Artist Tour (coming up
Oct. 11 and 12), often creates figure-like constructions, with wooden
limbs and knobby appendages attached to whimsical materials. Her work
here continues that idea of artwork as persona container.</TE>
<TE>   Outhouses aren't often pressed into the service of art, somewhat
surprisingly. Duchamp, after all, famously decreed a urinal art, and
therefore it was. A different agenda is at work with Ronda LaRue's
radically redecorated "porta-potty" outside the gallery. Her piece is
titled "A Contemplative Altar to Human Wastefulness."</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, "Assemblage" seems to lack a core, or a unified
statement. Then again, that very lack of cohesion may circle back to
the central idea of "found object"-based work, rescued from the trash
heap in the name of an art still being codified and defined.</TE>
<TE>   * "Assemblage," G. Childress Gallery, 319 E. El Roblar Drive,
Ojai. Hours: Monday-Saturday, 10 a.m.- 5 p.m. (805) 640-1387.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Revisiting the Scene: Those grisly recurrent images and somber
ruminations lorded over media sources as America, and Southern
California, commemorated the first anniversary of the tragedy of
Sept. 11. Ojai's modest but spirited theater company, Theater 150,
had another idea, and it put on a timely encore performance of last
fall's production, "Human Chain," in the Zalk Theater at Happy Valley
School last Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   This is the moving pastiche-like theater piece woven together by
company directors Elizabeth C. Rosengren Brown and Dwier Brown from a
mass of material--personal testimonies, articles, poems and other
sources. The resulting piece is an affecting, layered composite of
voices, like links in a chain, or patchwork in a quilt. Strength is
garnered from the cumulative process and the communal fabric.</TE>
<TE>   Five actors sat onstage and read through the script with lucidity
and feeling sometimes spilling over into tearfulness, as when the
image arose of war sounding a "pure, high note, like the anguish of a
mother singing to an empty bed." The subjects ranged from haunting
details of that day to philosophical asides, along with reflections
on the human capacity for hatred and violence. Meanwhile, musicians
J.B. White and Julie Christensen interspersed sparse, effective
musical interludes, ending on the poignant note of Paul Simon's
prayerful "American Tune."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indian Music Comes to Ojai: Since coming to the West in the '70s,
acclaimed Indian violinist L. Subramanian has ventured in many
musical directions, experimenting with Indo-jazz mergers and
classical crossover projects. He has the curiosity and the natural
virtuosity to excel in various musical terrains. However, when
Subramanian appears in concert at the Zalk Theater of the Happy
Valley Foundation Saturday, the musical focus will be on his
indigenous tradition, South Indian "Carnatic" music. Joining him will
be percussionist Mahesh Krishnamurthy, on the South Indian drum, the
mridangam.</TE>
<TE>   * L. Subramanian, Saturday, 5 p.m., Zalk Theater, Happy Valley
School, 8585 California 150, Ojai. Reservations, $60. (805) 640-9800.</TE>

would be used for that purpose. The story also incorrectly quoted
budget analyst Jean Ross as saying the "state never takes in less
money from one year to the next." She said that occurs "rarely,"
rather than "never."</LD>

<HD>3 New ABC Shows Post Strong Premiere Results</HD>
<DH>TV: Network executives are pleased as '8 Simple Rules' and
'Life With Bonnie' win their time slots. The programs faced mostly
reruns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a stretch in which precious little has gone right for ABC,
executives at the Walt Disney Co.-owned network expressed relief
Wednesday after registering strong Tuesday night results with
premieres of three series.</LD>
<LD>   The network's sitcoms "8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage
Daughter," starring John Ritter, and "Life With Bonnie," featuring
Bonnie Hunt, averaged 17.3 million and 16.1 million viewers,
respectively--easily winning their time slots both in overall viewing
and among adults ages 18 to 49, the key demographic to advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   Nielsen Media Research data showed that the Ritter show delivered
ABC's highest season premiere rating for that half-hour since
"Roseanne" was scheduled there in 1996.</LD>
<TE>   A preview of the interactive mystery "Push, Nevada" averaged 12
million viewers, though the audience did drop through the hour. The
series, whose producers include actor Ben Affleck, premieres in its
regular time slot tonight, also getting a jump on the new television
season that officially begins next week.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one hurdle we had to get over--to demonstrate that we
could open these new shows," said ABC Entertainment President Susan
Lyne, who had picked "8 Simple Rules" as the network's program with
the best chance of succeeding this season.</TE>
<TE>   Sluggish results at ABC have become a very public symbol of
Disney's perceived shortcomings and its lagging stock price. Disney
executives have said that they view turning around the network a top
priority.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors were quick to point out that ABC threw an expensive
promotional barrage behind the three series and that they largely
faced reruns, although "8 Simple Rules" went head to head with--and
handily surpassed--the season premiere of an established series on
News Corp.'s Fox network, "That '70s Show."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's Tuesday ratings are likely to decline once NBC, a unit of
General Electric Co., and Viacom Inc.-owned CBS join the fray with
original programs next week. "Life With Bonnie," for example, will
regularly face NBC's long-running hit "Frasier," and "Push, Nevada"
goes into one of television's most challenging time periods, versus
CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" and NBC's "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   Still, given how low ABC's ratings dipped over the summer--down
more than 20% versus last year, largely because of the absence of
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"--media analysts have questioned
whether the network was attracting enough viewers to adequately
promote its shows.</TE>
<TE>   John Rash, senior vice president and director of broadcast
negotiations at Campbell Mithun Esty, a Minneapolis-based advertising
agency, said that although "one night does not a season make,"
Tuesday's results indicate that Disney's marketing machine "can make
Americans aware of any cultural product."</TE>
<TE>   The question now, advertisers say, is how many viewers return in
later weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Tuesday is the building block for their network. They really need
it to work," said Laura Caraccioli, vice president and director at
Starcom Entertainment, a Chicago-based media services company. "It's
just too early to tell."</TE>
<TE>   Viewers "get all hyped up to watch that first show," said Tom
DeCabia, executive vice president of PHD-USA, which buys commercial
time for advertisers. "But we want to see if the audience comes back
a second time. That tells it all."</TE>

<HD>Many Southland Workers Fall in Gap Between Income, Rents</HD>
<DH>Minimum wage is not enough as housing costs climb, report
says</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armando Mantilla labors about 40 hours a week as a pastry chef at a
Tarzana catering company. But he's not even close to being able to
afford a standard two-bedroom apartment in the Los Angeles area. A
low-wage earner such as Mantilla would have to log 84 hours--the
equivalent of more than twice the standard workweek.</LD>
<LD>   For the fourth consecutive year, the minimum wage was insufficient
to cover the rent for adequate housing anywhere in the U.S., and
Southern California has one of the widest affordability gaps,
according to a study of 2001 statistics released Wednesday by the
National Low Income Housing Coalition.</LD>
<LD>   The Washington-based advocacy group for the poor found that U.S.
workers must earn at least $14.66 an hour--almost three times as much
as the federal minimum wage of $5.15--to pay rent on a standard
two-bedroom apartment. California's hourly minimum wage was increased
this year by 50 cents to $6.75, but that still is less than half of
what renters need to earn to afford a standard apartment in the Los
Angeles region.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment at the low
end of the rental market climbed 5.7% to $1,088 in Los Angeles County
and 3.1% to $1,141 in Orange County, the study found. The data were
gathered by RealFacts, a Novato, Calif.-based firm that tracks 5,500
apartment complexes in the western U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, about 862,000 workers--or 10.9% of the
work force--last year earned within one dollar of the state's
then-minimum wage of $6.25 an hour, according to the Economic Policy
Institute, a Washington think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Because rents have risen so fast in and around Los Angeles, many
families have been forced to cram into one-bedroom units with other
families or to live in substandard dwellings. Low-income housing
advocates define a "standard" dwelling as a "no-frills, two-bedroom,
one-bath apartment with kitchen and living room." The federal
government considers housing affordable when it costs 30% or less of
gross income.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old Mantilla, who earns $9 an hour, shares a
one-bedroom Los Angeles apartment with his wife, Maria, and their
8-year-old daughter. He struggles every month to pay his $325 rent
out of a $1,420 monthly paycheck, which also must cover medical bills
for Maria; the 44-year-old has cancer and does not work. Mantilla
also sends $575 a month to relatives in Mexico, forcing the couple to
rely on the local church to feed them.</TE>
<TE>   "I recently found a slightly better apartment for $575, but that's
too much for me," Mantilla said. "The cheaper ones are dirty and
terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Rod Field, executive director of the Los Angeles Housing Law
Project, cautioned that the situation for many people isn't going to
get better any time soon. The problem is "getting worse," Field said.</TE>
<TE>   The elderly and single moms "are just desperate," he said,
"especially those being evicted."</TE>
<TE>   That's just what happened to Morena Gonzalez, 27, who was tossed
from her Los Angeles apartment last month after failing to make the
rent on the one-bedroom unit she shares with her three young
children. The single mother, who works at a bakery, earns $290 a
week, which, along with a $674 monthly welfare check, must cover her
$750 rent at a new place and $400 in monthly child care bills.</TE>
<TE>   "My old apartment had rats and cockroaches," Gonzalez said. "Thank
God I have this place now, but it's more than I can afford."</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the problem, analysts say, is that federal subsidies
on an increasing number of apartments set aside for low-income
tenants are scheduled to expire between now and 2006. When these
subsidies go away, apartment owners are free to quit the federal
program, putting even more pressure on low-income renters.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County lost 6,000 federally subsidized, or Section 8,
housing contracts last year, and about 4,000 units have been lost
this year, said Steve Renahan, executive director of the Housing
Authority of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Additional housing would help ease the situation, but construction
of multifamily units still lags in Los Angeles County. The county's
population grew by 160,000 last year, but only 9,926 permits for new
multifamily units were issued, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for
the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The number of building permits issued for multifamily units is
running behind by 18.7% compared with last year at this time, further
exacerbating an already desperate situation, Kyser said. The major
factor there is cost. "Prices for developable land are going through
the roof. It's scary," Kyser said. "We're not going to solve the
problem soon, either. In 2010, we'll be writing the same story,
unless there's a dramatic change."</TE>
<TE>   One change already is in the works. This year, the Los Angeles
City Council approved the creation of a $100-million trust fund to
build affordable housing in Los Angeles. The fund has accumulated $42
million, will add $57 million next year and will maintain $100
million every year after that, said Councilman Eric Garcetti,
chairman of the Economic Development and Employment Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The City Council also has placed a moratorium on the eviction of
low-income renters in Los Angeles whose landlords claim they need the
apartments vacated for renovations.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, two new zoning ordinances will go into effect next
month, Garcetti said. One will allow formerly commercial space to be
used for housing, and the other will streamline the approval process
for mixed-use commercial and residential projects.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, a statewide housing bond, Proposition 46, is on the
November ballot. If passed, it would represent the largest allocation
for housing production in the state's history. The bond would help
create or preserve 131,000 units of affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year in Los Angeles County, there's a bigger housing
deficit," said Sam Mistrano, deputy director of the Southern
California Assn. of Non-Profit Housing. "Maybe this is the year when
community leaders and the public can focus on the issue."</TE>

<HD>End to TV Set-Tops Clash Sought</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top executives from the consumer electronics and cable television
industries are privately trying to strike a deal to end their long,
bitter battle over set-top boxes.</LD>
<LD>   Set manufacturers have sought for more than a decade to make TVs
that could plug into any cable company's network without need for a
set-top box, just as telephones and answering machines can plug
directly into any phone company's lines. But ever since cable
operators introduced digital cable service in the late 1990s, no sets
have been truly "cable ready"--not even the latest digital TVs.</LD>
<LD>   The dispute is complex, with the two sides battling to control
on-screen program guides and other potentially lucrative services.
Also at stake are consumers' ability to record certain shows and to
watch premium high-definition television programs on older HDTV sets.</LD>
<TE>   Pressure from Congress and regulators has improved prospects for a
deal. And Wednesday, House Energy and Commerce Chairman W.J. "Billy"
Tauzin (R-La.) circulated a draft bill that would enable TV sets to
offer simple digital cable services without a set-top box.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the talks have promised to strike a compromise by Oct.
10, or turn the problem over to federal regulators to solve.
Officials on both sides confirmed the talks but declined to comment
on the status of the negotiations, saying they had agreed to remain
mum until the talks concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a number of complex technical and business issues on
the table in discussions that involve multiple companies in the cable
and consumer electronics industries," said Marc Osgoode Smith, a
spokesman for the National Cable and Telecommunications Assn. "The
exchange of views between industries has been constructive but
because these private discussions are ongoing, we prefer not to
comment further."</TE>
<TE>   About two-thirds of all U.S. homes have cable TV, and about half
of all cable customers have set-top boxes. That percentage rises
dramatically in communities where cable operators have pushed digital
cable service aggressively, such as Pasadena, where Charter
Communications Inc. offers HBO and other premium channels only to
digital cable subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Set-top boxes not only cost consumers an additional $3 to $6 per
month, but they also interfere with some of the devices that
consumer-electronics companies are eager to sell. For example, most
set-top boxes disable a TV set's "picture-in-picture" feature, and
many digital set-tops have trouble working with personal video
recorders.</TE>
<TE>   To solve the compatibility problems once and for all, set
manufacturers need to add two things to their TVs: the circuitry
required to tune in digital cable channels, and a plug-in security
module that can unlock premium channels. Before they do so, however,
manufacturers want the cable operators to drop some of the conditions
their research-and-development arm, Cable Laboratories, has placed on
the security module.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives from the cable and consumer-electronics industries
have held three meetings this summer, with a fourth scheduled for
this month. Meanwhile, CableLabs officials continue to negotiate
privately with individual set manufacturers, trying to satisfy their
concerns over the security module.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources close to the manufacturers, one of their main
complaints is that the cable operators want to give Hollywood studios
and other programmers too much power to block digital copying and
downgrade HDTV signals through the most common connectors.</TE>
<TE>   Cable executives say they simply want the flexibility to offer
Hollywood the same protection it gets from satellite operators. And
Hollywood studios say they need the option to downgrade some HDTV
signals to guard against piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Some manufacturers suspect the cable operators want to limit home
recording, forcing consumers to rely on the video-on-demand and
network-based recording services that the cable operators are
introducing.</TE>
<TE>   Giving consumers a taste of what the cable operators could do,
Cablevision Systems Corp., the nation's seventh-largest operator,
recently blocked digital copying of all programs on its digital-cable
channels--a restriction the company blamed on a software bug.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers also want to build digital-cable circuitry into
their sets without many of the advanced features that CableLabs
requires, such as support for video-on-demand. And they want to
provide their own electronic program guides, a prime piece of
on-screen real estate. Cable operators see the program guide as
fertile ground for advertising, as well as a launching pad for
fee-based services.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Expected to Settle Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending a battle with America's biggest bank, the Federal Trade
Commission today is expected to announce a settlement of its lawsuit
alleging that a Citigroup Inc. lending unit misled and cheated
customers, sources said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although admitting no wrongdoing, sources said, Citigroup will pay
more than $200 million to settle the FTC suit. The New York-based
financial services company, which says it has cleaned up the unit's
lending practices, earlier this week promised to cut some loan fees
and give customers better information about credit insurance.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement could have an immediate effect in California by
helping Citigroup win approval for its planned acquisition of Golden
State Bancorp, parent of California Federal Bank and a key part of
its expansion plans. The Federal Reserve has yet to approve the deal,
and in four rounds of written questions has grilled Citigroup about
its sub-prime lending, which focuses on extending credit to customers
with poor credit.</LD>
<TE>   FTC Chairman Timothy J. Muris scheduled a news conference this
morning in Washington to announce the settlement. The FTC and the
bank declined to discuss details of the deal. But Citigroup
spokeswoman Maria Mendler said settling the FTC suit would help keep
the Golden State deal on track to close by the end of this month as
planned.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope all our constituencies would regard [a settlement]
as a highly positive step," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is the biggest of 17 cases the FTC has filed against
allegedly predatory sub-prime lenders. The largest previous
settlement among those cases, for about $75 million, was finalized
last week with First Alliance Corp., a defunct Irvine home equity
lender.</TE>
<TE>   Alleging violations of truth-in-lending and fair-credit laws, the
FTC suit against Citigroup targeted practices at Associates First
Capital, the former consumer finance arm of Ford Motor Co. and the
nation's largest sub-prime lender when Citigroup acquired it in
November 1990 for $27 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Associates charged borrowers fees as high as 8% of the loan amount
and, while pressuring borrowers to refinance their debts,
misrepresented the savings that would result, according to the suit.
The FTC also alleged that the company improperly pushed borrowers to
buy a controversial form of mortgage insurance.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup has stopped selling the single-premium insurance, which
typically expired in five years even though borrowers continued to
pay for it over the life of the loan.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said they hope the case will send a message:
Although customers with less-than-perfect credit may have to pay
higher interest and fees to make up for the extra risk, the lenders
must clearly explain the costs and consequences of the loans.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's hope that maybe we can wake up the sub-prime lenders," said
one FTC official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Community groups that have opposed Citigroup's acquisition of San
Francisco-based Golden State said the FTC settlement didn't go far
enough. Robert Gnaizda, general counsel of the Greenlining Coalition
in San Francisco, repeated demands that the Fed hold public hearings
in Los Angeles on Citigroup's lending practices.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC deal "may be the largest settlement yet, but it's still
inadequate," Gnaizda said after meeting with regulators and bank
executives in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He said the FTC was never given access to the volumes of data on
Citigroup's lending practices that the Fed obtained during its review
of the proposed merger, and didn't have a complete picture of the
extent of lending violations.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Key stock indexes in Germany and France fell to new bear-market lows
Wednesday, sliding through their worst levels of midsummer, as the
economic outlook for the region continues to dim.</LD>
<LD>   The German DAX index slumped 164.21 points, or 5%, to 3,124.92,
its lowest level since 1997. The French CAC index dropped 3.6% to
3,000.98, its lowest since 1998.</LD>
<LD>   Other European markets also fell sharply. The Italian market sank
2.9%, the British market lost 4% and the Dutch market tumbled 4.9%.</LD>
<TE>   A French government report Wednesday showed that industrial
production in July fell 1%, its biggest drop in nine months.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the German car industry said August sales slid 4.7%.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors have to be able to know what economic growth, and
therefore profit growth, is going to be," said Michael Stam, who
helps manage $5.4 billion at Fortis Investment Management in Paris.
"The problem is they just don't know."</TE>
<TE>   European markets also have been riled by worries about leading
insurance companies, whose assets have been hammered by the plunge in
their stock holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Swiss Life, the biggest life-insurance company in Switzerland, on
Wednesday reported a deeper-than-expected loss for the first half,
sending its shares down 18% to a 10-year low.</TE>
<TE>   "Investor confidence has disappeared again," said Peter Cogliatti,
a trader at Williams de Broe in London. "Every time you think things
can't get any worse, they do."</TE>

<HD>Panel Told of 'Sham' Global, Qwest Deals</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Congressional investigators will reveal
allegations by former employees of the firms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. and Qwest Communications International Inc.
engaged in "sham" transactions and secret side deals to help meet
Wall Street targets, according to statements from former employees
disclosed Wednesday by a congressional committee investigating the
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The allegations, which will be detailed under oath during a
congressional hearing next week, are expected to increase the
pressure on several high-profile company executives, including Global
Crossing Chairman Gary Winnick and Qwest's former chief executive,
Joseph Nacchio.</LD>
<LD>   Both men have been criticized for selling large amounts of stock
during periods when the companies were struggling to book sales and
keep share prices from falling further. Both companies are under
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Justice Department for allegedly misleading investors through suspect
accounting.</LD>
<TE>   The companies have denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with new information from current and former employees, the
House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to intensify its scrutiny
of Global Crossing, Qwest and other firms by subpoenaing additional
information and holding hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "I am stunned by what we have learned so far," said Rep. James C.
Greenwood (R-Pa.), who heads the committee's oversight and
investigations panel. "These companies seem to have had cultures that
demanded making Wall Street numbers at all costs, even if it means
entering into sham transactions and secret deals."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick "has agreed to meet with our investigators if we drop the
subpoena and not force him to testify before the committee under
oath," said committee spokesman Ken Johnson. "Our response was, 'Tell
us when to quit laughing.' "</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Winnick is in no position to dictate the terms of his
appearance before the committee. He has a simple choice: to testify
before the committee or take the Fifth."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Naftalis, Winnick's attorney, said, "We are disappointed that
the committee's spokesperson continues to make unfair and
inappropriate statements about my client and Global Crossing."</TE>
<TE>   The hearings will focus on allegations that the two companies
swapped fiber-optic network capacity in deals designed to bolster
both companies' financial performance. Although no money changed
hands in the deals, the companies recorded the transactions as if
they had received cash.</TE>
<TE>   The first hearing Tuesday will present two panels of current and
former employees from both firms, including former Global Crossing
accounting executive Roy Olofson, who disclosed irregularities within
the company last year.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick and Nacchio will be called to testify at a second hearing
tentatively scheduled for early next month.</TE>
<TE>   They are expected to be joined at the hearing by Qwest President
Afshin Mohebbi, former Global Crossing general counsel James Gorton,
Global Crossing Chief Executive John Legere, and Joseph Perrone,
executive vice president of finance at Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Johnson said, the investigating committee is expected to
get greater power to subpoena testimony and documents from Global
Crossing and Qwest. "Both companies in several instances have been
slow to produce documents and have flat-out refused to provide them
in others," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   He singled out Qwest, saying the firm has invoked attorney-client
privilege and refused to turn over the results of an internal probe
into one of the transactions in question.</TE>
<TE>   Documents and interviews indicate that Qwest struck undisclosed
side deals with other telecommunications companies that significantly
altered the net financial result for Qwest, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   "Qwest still insists they never took place," he said. "But Global
Crossing had similar deals with Qwest, and [other companies] have
confirmed to the committee that they had side agreements with Qwest
as well."</TE>
<TE>   Qwest is cooperating, spokesman Bill Myers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've provided the committee with more than 250,000 pages of
documents," he said, "and we're continuing to work with them on
additional requests."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing also said it had cooperated fully with the
committee and provided "approximately 60,000 pages of documents and
roughly 40,000 e-mails and e-mail attachments."</TE>
<TE>   The firm, which filed for bankruptcy protection in January, also
has made available 18 present and former directors, officers and
employees for interviews.</TE>

<HD>Jack in the Box Says It Will Expand Into National Market</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: Fast-food chain is developing a 'more
relevant' menu featuring lighter fare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack in the Box Inc. said Wednesday that it plans to expand from a
regional player in the fast-food industry into a national restaurant
chain by adding nearly 300 outlets a year.</LD>
<LD>   The San Diego-based company linked its planned expansion to an
optimistic forecast for its operations, including double-digit annual
earnings growth over the next five years. Shares jumped nearly 6% to
$23.58 on the New York Stock Exchange. They tumbled last week after
the firm warned of a fourth-quarter profit shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   Jack in the Box Chief Executive Robert J. Nugent said the chain of
1,847 fast-food outlets was evaluating the acquisition of other
chains and will expand its Box C-Stores, which co-brand a Jack in the
Box restaurant with a Quick Stuff convenience store and a gas
station.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, the firm, which operates in 17 states, will
broaden its reach by adding about 200 franchises annually and opening
company-owned stores at a rate of about 90 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Jack in the Box said it expects sales at restaurants open at least
a year to grow 3% next year. Overall restaurant sales are expected to
grow 7% to an estimated $1.95 billion next year and the firm expects
earnings growth of 10% to 15% annually over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   With successful menu items such as its Sourdough Jack sandwich,
Jack in the Box says it has increased its market share by 25% over
the last four years, a time when discounting and slow growth have
hurt other big fast-food chains such as CKE Restaurants Inc., the
owner of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's chains.</TE>
<TE>   Known for its entertaining television commercials--the current
versions poke fun at competitors such as Wendy's International Inc.
and Subway and feature its fictional "chief executive" Jack--the
fast-food chain has built a strong following among men age 18 to 34.</TE>
<TE>   But in announcing its expansion strategy Wednesday, the company
said it is developing "a more relevant menu that includes lighter
fare."</TE>
<TE>   "By strengthening the Jack in the Box brand and pursuing growth
with more flexible options, the company can better position itself as
an increasingly profitable restaurant company," Nugent said.</TE>
<TE>   In a report to investors, Andrew Barish, an analyst with Banc of
America Securities in San Francisco, said he believed the company's
plan to increase the number of franchised outlets is sound. But he
cautioned that in the current fast-food environment the new
initiatives "will not likely produce results overnight."</TE>
<TE>   Barish said expanding into lighter fare to reach women and older
customers is risky. A "light" menu developed by Irvine-based Taco
Bell a decade ago turned off its core teenage customers and failed to
attract new customers.</TE>

<HD>Bank of Japan May Buy Shares From Lenders</HD>
<DH>Economy: Move would be part of effort to ease bad debt and
stabilize financial system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENJI HALL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Japan's central bank said Wednesday that it is considering buying
shares from the country's struggling banks as part of a radical plan
to stabilize the financial system and help the banks get rid of
massive debt from bad loans.</LD>
<LD>   The news helped spark a major rally in Japanese stocks today,
driving the Nikkei-225 index up 360.42 points, or 3.8%, to 9,832.48
in afternoon trading. The yen rallied against the dollar.</LD>
<LD>   The Bank of Japan governor, Masaru Hayami, said lenders would be
able to sell their stockholdings directly to the central bank only in
an emergency, and not through the market. The Bank of Japan would buy
the shares at market value and hold them for about 10 years, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Hayami, speaking to reporters after the central bank's policy
board left its monetary policy unchanged, said he would provide
specifics soon.</TE>
<TE>   Hayami acknowledged that the new steps could damage the central
bank's balance sheet. But he warned that unless banks reduce their
stockholdings to free up cash, they were unlikely to deal quickly
with their massive loan problems.</TE>
<TE>   The government has said bad loans at the nation's banks swelled to
$352 billion in March from $295 billion six months earlier. Analysts
say the true figures probably are much higher.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese banks, among the biggest investors in the Tokyo stock
market, have been selling stocks in recent years, but losses have
accumulated as the market has fallen. The Nikkei index hit a 19-year
low of 9,075.09 on Sept. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the Bank of Japan's move would place a floor under
stock prices, at least in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank's resolve to bolster shaky lenders and help banks
write off bad loans could quiet calls from lawmakers and Cabinet
officials for more aggressive steps to boost the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Critics worry, however, that the Bank of Japan may compromise its
credibility if it appears to be caving to political pressure or
trying to manipulate financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, the bank's policy board decided to keep
short-term interest rates near zero and continue providing funding to
banks at virtually no cost.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank has held rates near zero for the last two years
and made it easier for banks to secure funding. So far, however, the
bank's policy has failed to spark a sustained economic turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   In its monthly assessment for September, the Cabinet said
Wednesday that Japan's economy faced increasing risks from declining
stock prices and a worrisome U.S. economy, though it is still on a
tentative road to recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Although Japan's downturn appears to have bottomed out and signs
of better times have appeared, unemployment is soaring and deflation
continues to plague the economy.</TE>

<HD>KB Home's Net Income Rises 39%</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The home builder beats analyst estimates and
raises the yearly outlook.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>KB Home, one of the nation's largest home builders, Wednesday
reported record profit during its fiscal third quarter and raised its
earnings outlook for the year as the housing industry continues to
thrive.</LD>
<LD>   Net income rose 39% during the three months ended Aug. 31 to $83.9
million, the company's highest quarterly profit, or $1.95 a share,
compared with $60.4 million, or $1.58, a year earlier. The
Westwood-based company beat analysts' consensus estimate by 28 cents
a share.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose to nearly $1.29 billion in the latest period, up 5%
from $1.23 billion a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   KB Home has improved its efficiency by corralling home-building
costs, Chairman Bruce Karatz said. And sales have been boosted by
incorporating standard features requested by home buyers in surveys
conducted by the builder, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The company reported net orders of 6,320 units, up about 10% from
a year earlier, as all 15 markets KB Home serves from California to
Florida reported increases in volume. A backlog of orders valued at
$2.64 billion was reported, the highest for any third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The results led KB Home to raise its profit forecast for the year
to $6.75 a share from $6.50. The level of profit achieved in the
third quarter is too large to be sustained, Karatz said, but he
expects net income to rise by at least 15% in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   "Demographics seem to be so strong that housing demand will
continue to be very healthy," he said, "and will be in the future."</TE>
<TE>   The company also announced Wednesday an agreement to acquire
American Heritage Homes of Orlando, Fla. KB Home has been expanding
in large states that have rapid growth, including Florida, which
ranks third in home building, behind California and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Another major builder, Lennar Corp., also reported record results
for its fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31. Profit grew 33% to $142.2
million or $2.01 a share, compared with $106.7 million, or $1.53 a
share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Miami builder, which expanded its presence in Southern
California this summer by acquiring a major builder in the Inland
Empire, reported revenue of $1.86 billion in the quarter, up 18% from
a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate report, the National Assn. of Home Builders said
builders' confidence has soared to its highest level since November
2000. The index, a measure of builders' outlook for sales, rose eight
points this month to 63, overcoming a six-point dip the last month.</TE>
<TE>   "Builders expect the housing juggernaut to roll on for the
foreseeable future," Stephen Stanley, an economist at Greenwich
Capital Markets Inc., wrote in a note to investors.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home closed at $50.24 on the New York Stock Exchange, down
$1.37. Lennar finished down $1.14 at $56.65.</TE>
<TE>   KB shares have risen 25% this year while Lennar is up 21%. Most
builders' shares have rocketed since 1999, but they have largely
stalled out since spring as investors have taken profits.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Fall on Bleak Forecasts From 2 Bellwether Firms</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: J.P. Morgan says third-quarter profit will be
much lower, while Oracle warns of lower revenue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks rebounded from early losses Wednesday but still closed at
fresh six-week lows as bleak forecasts from J.P. Morgan Chase and
Oracle sparked weakness in a market worried about the outlook for
corporate profits.</LD>
<LD>   "Those are bellwether companies. They will certainly create domino
effects within their industry groups," said Richard Cripps, chief
market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</LD>
<LD>   Investors are on edge as earnings-warning season--when companies
warn if they will miss expectations--heats up. Fears of a second Gulf
War also are dogging stocks, even after Iraq's agreement to admit
U.N. weapons inspectors. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on
Wednesday pressed Congress for immediate support for a possible U.S.
strike against Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average, off 155 points in the early
going, closed down 35.10 points, or 0.4%, at 8,172.45. The finish,
which came after a 172-point drop Tuesday, was the lowest since Aug.
5, when blue chips closed at 8,043.63.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 7.81 points, or 0.6%, to 1,252.13. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index dropped 4.06 points, or 0.5%, to 869.46.</TE>
<TE>   Losers outnumbered winners by 5 to 3 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq. Trading was active, outpacing the levels of
recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan fell as low as $18.80, then closed off $1.11 at $20.44
after the second-largest U.S. bank said late Tuesday that
third-quarter profit would fall well below second-quarter results.
The news dragged down the financial sector, including Citigroup,
which fell 69 cents to $29.11, and Bank of America, which lost $1.75
to $66.30.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage Morgan Stanley, which will report earnings today, fell
84 cents to $38.10. But rival Bear Stearns gained 93 cents to $60.43.
The firm said third-quarter net income rose 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks fell in concert with Oracle, which dropped 71 cents to
$8.32 after the software maker predicted lower revenue in the current
quarter due to weak sales. IBM fell $2.20 to $69.55 and was the
biggest drag on the Dow.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, mixed economic reports added to the market's caution.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department said consumer inflation rose 0.3% in August,
the biggest gain in four months. The lack of inflation pressures has
been a main reason the Federal Reserve has been able to hold
short-term interest rates at 40-year lows this year.</TE>
<TE>   But the Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit
fell to $34.6 billion in July as exports rose for a fifth month.</TE>
<TE>   The unexpected rise in the inflation rate pushed bond yields
higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to
3.84% from 3.82% on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   In commodities trading, worries of military action against Iraq
pushed gold up $3.60 to $320.06 an ounce and oil up 40 cents to
$29.48 a barrel, both in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks ranked among the biggest losers after Merrill
Lynch cut investment ratings on Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines
and Northwest Airlines to "neutral" from "buy," saying it does not
expect the industry to return to profitability until 2004.
Continental sank $1.24 to $6.79, Delta fell $1.47 to $12.77 and
Northwest dropped 66 cents to $7.69.</TE>
<TE>   * Candy maker Hershey Foods tumbled $8.81, or 12%, to $65 after
ending its controversial search for a buyer. Controlling shareholder
the Hershey Trust rejected two bids--the higher one for more than $12
billion, from Wm. Wrigley Jr.--and took the company off the auction
block.</TE>
<TE>   * Drug research equipment maker Harvard Bioscience plunged $2.53,
or 53%, to $2.25 and ranked as the largest percentage loser on
Nasdaq. The company warned that third-quarter earnings will be flat
due to slower-than-expected adoption of new technology and weak
international sales.</TE>
<TE>   * Abbott Laboratories climbed $1.83 to $40.42 after Merrill Lynch
raised its investment rating on the firm to "buy" from "neutral,"
saying its experimental arthritis drug D2E7 could gain U.S. approval
earlier than expected.</TE>

<HD>Merrill Fires 2 Senior Officials</HD>
<DH>Probe: A vice chairman and the head of the energy
investment unit are let go for failing to cooperate with Enron
investigations, firm says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. fired two senior officials Wednesday for what the
company said was their refusal to cooperate with government probes
into the downfall of Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The men are two of the highest-profile brokerage executives to
lose their jobs in what has become a series of interlocking corporate
scandals on Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill terminated Thomas W. Davis, a vice chairman who was chief
of global stock research and who previously had overseen the firm's
investment banking business. Davis was one of two Merrill executives
who held the title of vice chairman.</LD>
<TE>   The brokerage also let go Schuyler Tilney, who headed Merrill's
energy industry investment banking.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the firm said the men violated company policy by
refusing to testify in investigations by the Justice Department and
the Securities and Exchange Commission into Merrill's work in helping
to finance Enron. A Merrill spokesman declined additional comment.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' attorney did not return a phone call; Tilney could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The terminations follow by less than two weeks Citigroup Inc.'s
removal of Michael Carpenter as head of the firm's Salomon Smith
Barney brokerage unit. The company reassigned Carpenter amid
investigations into Salomon's business dealings with Enron and
congressional hearings on the conduct of analyst Jack Grubman.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman resigned last month as regulators probed his bullish
recommendations of telecom stocks even as the shares plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Outside experts saw Merrill's moves Wednesday as intended to show
the firm is punishing those responsible for possible abuses.</TE>
<TE>   "The analogy is to any professional sports team that has negative
developments," said Michael Holland, head of a New York investment
firm that bears his name. "People are the obvious targets, whether
it's the manager of a baseball team or a senior person at a financial
services firm. It shows action" being taken by the company.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts questioned whether the firings would improve
Merrill's image with regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, 49, previously had announced his intention to retire next
month. In July, Tilney refused to testify before a Senate panel
investigating Enron and had been placed on administrative leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Two months after Schuyler Tilney took the Fifth Amendment,
Merrill Lynch has discovered that he didn't cooperate in a public
investigation," said John Coffee, a Columbia University securities
law professor. "Merrill recognizes that the storm is not subsiding
and they can't simply tough it out. They must take corrective
action."</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's relationship with Enron has come under intense
scrutiny by Congress and criminal prosecutors. Their investigations
center on whether large investment banks intentionally helped the
energy company deceive investors by structuring deals that
underplayed Enron's debt and overstated its earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill said in its statement that it "is not aware of any
evidence that its employees acted improperly in their dealings with
Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill's image has been hit this year by a number of
controversies concerning its conduct. In spring the firm paid $100
million to settle a probe into its research practices by the New York
attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, an indictment of former Tyco International Ltd. Chief
Executive L. Dennis Kozlowski alleged that he pressured Merrill in
1999 to replace its Tyco analyst with someone preferred by Kozlowski.
Merrill has said the new analyst was hired for his expertise.</TE>

<HD>Rivals Say Microsoft Is Reneging on Antitrust Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. IAN HOPPER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. isn't living up to its agreement with the federal
government to allow Windows users to remove access to the company's
programs and choose competitors' products, a group funded by
Microsoft's rivals said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   ProComp, backed by companies including Oracle Corp., Sun
Microsystems Inc. and AOL Time Warner Inc., sent a letter to Justice
Department antitrust chief Charles A. James and state attorneys
general.</LD>
<LD>   "It cannot be argued that Microsoft made even a good-faith effort
to comply," said the letter, written by ProComp chief Mitchell S.
Pettit.</LD>
<TE>   Under a federal antitrust settlement reached late last year,
Microsoft was ordered to come up with a way to hide access to its
software--such as the Internet Explorer Web browser, Windows Media
Player and Windows Messenger--and allow users to choose non-Microsoft
products.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft tested the customization program for software developers
before it was released to consumers this month and any complaints
should have been aired then, spokesman Jim Desler said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate but hardly surprising that this special-interest
group chose not to play a part in the beta process and rather chose
to play politics on this issue," Desler said.</TE>
<TE>   ProComp said Microsoft makes it unnecessarily difficult for
consumers to use the software, called Program Access.</TE>
<TE>   The software is available only with a huge download of Windows bug
fixes called Service Pack 1. The service pack requires a large amount
of hard-drive space and installation takes more than an hour on a
typical Internet connection.</TE>
<TE>   A Windows user with a slow Internet connection can buy the update
on CD-ROM for about $10. Because it costs less than that to
manufacture and ship a CD, Pettit said, Microsoft may profit from its
effort to comply with the settlement, which the company denies.</TE>
<TE>   Most non-Microsoft products won't appear in the Program Access
software for some time because they need to be modified to appear as
options. Pettit said the wait is unnecessary because other parts of
Windows already allow similar choices for Web browser and e-mail
programs.</TE>

<HD>Ex-CFO of Motorcar Agrees to Guilty Plea</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former chief financial officer of Motorcar Parts &amp; Accessories
Inc. agreed Wednesday to plead guilty to criminal charges that he
sharply inflated the Torrance firm's earnings in 1997 and 1998.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. attorney's
office in Los Angeles said Peter Bromberg, 38, falsified Motorcar's
financial performance for those two years. Bromberg, who left the
firm in May 1999, will be arraigned Sept. 30 in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said Motorcar, which remanufactures and distributes
replacement alternators and starters for cars and trucks, has settled
similar civil charges with the agency. Civil charges brought by the
SEC against Bromberg are pending.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a small company, but our message is very clear: We take
financial reporting very seriously," said Randall Lee, director of
the SEC's Pacific region. "In the cases of intentional misconduct, we
will work with criminal authorities to bring appropriate charges."</TE>
<TE>   Motorcar's shares plunged in 1999 after the company said it found
accounting irregularities and restated its results.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's complaint alleged that Motorcar and Bromberg overstated
pretax earnings by $3.39 million in 1997 and $3.57 million in 1998
and hid returned goods at off-site trailers so company auditors
couldn't track them.</TE>

<HD>Suit Over Technology Filed by DirecTV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID STREITFELD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DirecTV Inc., the country's biggest satellite television operation,
said it had filed a federal lawsuit against NDS Group, alleging
fraud, breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets.</LD>
<LD>   "We bought and paid for technology that NDS has withheld and is
obligated to deliver us under our contract," said DirecTV spokesman
Bob Marsocci. "I don't know what their motives are."</LD>
<LD>   NDS supplies the smart cards that prevent DirecTV's transmissions
from being pirated. NDS said the allegations in the suit, which was
filed Sept. 6 under seal in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles,
lacked merit.</LD>
<TE>   El Segundo-based DirecTV, a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., has
10.7 million subscribers. Last spring, NDS revealed that DirecTV was
dropping its services and moving all encryption technology in-house.
Neither company gave a reason for the switch, which will be completed
next summer.</TE>
<TE>   The suit comes at a time of legal troubles for NDS, a British
company that is 80%-owned by News Corp. The American division of NDS
is based in Newport Beach. Last spring, Canal Plus Technologies, a
rival smart-card manufacturer, sued NDS in San Francisco. Canal Plus,
a division of Vivendi Universal, charged that NDS had cracked its
cards and posted the code on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   In the Canal Plus case, NDS on Aug. 30 asked for a preliminary
injunction, which would have essentially frozen the case. The
requirements for an injunction would have been a likelihood of
success on the merits and a demonstration that NDS would suffer
irrevocable harm if the case proceeded.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker rebuked NDS lawyers for making
such a request: "No way in the world I can make a declaration on the
record that you're likely to prevail. You're dead right out of the
box."</TE>
<TE>   The judges ordered depositions in the case to proceed. Canal Plus
lawyers will question NDS Chief Executive Abraham Peled today in New
York.</TE>

<HD>Ports Bracing for a Shutdown</HD>
<DH>Labor: Tensions escalate as the union is accused of
slowdowns and shipping lines threaten a lockout. Retailers fear a
disruption in their holiday season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retailers and manufacturers braced Wednesday for the possible closure
of West Coast ports after union slowdowns were reported in Long Beach
and Oakland and major shipping lines warned they were prepared to
lock out workers.</LD>
<LD>   The International Longshore and Warehouse Union denied that it
orchestrated work stoppages and said the shipping lines, which have
been in difficult contract negotiations with the union for four
months, were exaggerating staffing problems to set up a
confrontation.</LD>
<LD>   "There is so much work that there aren't enough people for the
jobs," ILWU spokesman Steve Stallone said of the union's failure to
provide full work crews at the Long Beach terminal of Stevedoring
Services of America on Wednesday morning. "But if they want to lock
us out and actually cause a crisis, go ahead. Bring it on."</LD>
<TE>   Later Wednesday, 19 union members failed to return to work after
lunch at an Oakland terminal operated by Maersk Sealand. The workers
were key members of a crew unloading a CSX Lines container ship, and
their action prevented the ship from being unloaded and leaving port
on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone said the workers were protesting a scheduling change that
prevented them from attending a union rally.</TE>
<TE>   A slowdown also was reported Monday at the SSA terminal in Long
Beach, grounding all rail operations.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents major
shipping lines, will be in communication today to consider their
options, said association President Joseph Miniace.</TE>
<TE>   Miniace said the PMA board Wednesday unanimously authorized him to
"take defensive action" against slowdowns, which would include
locking out workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The union is playing with fire and appears to be willing to
jeopardize America's economic interests by initiating hit-and-run
tactics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The PMA warned the union before contract talks began May 13 that
it would not tolerate work slowdowns, which it said the union had
staged at critical times during contract talks in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The union and the PMA each appeared to be building a case to blame
the other in the event of port closures. When asked at what point he
would call for a lockout, Miniace said, "When we're satisfied that
they understand the consequences of their actions and they blatantly
continue.... It's going to be known that it's the union provoking
us."</TE>
<TE>   The escalating conflict between dockworkers and shipping lines
comes during the peak holiday shipping season, when transpacific
shipping lines are running at full capacity and retailers are eager
to stock their shelves. The 29 ports along the coast handle $300
billion in imports and exports annually and represent about 7% of the
nation's gross national product.</TE>
<TE>   The action in Long Beach stranded a China Ocean Shipping Co. ship
holding 3,000 containers destined for customers throughout the West.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of dollars in merchandise is impacted," said Andy
McLauchlan, a vice president at Seattle-based SSA, which operates the
terminal. The delay also could disrupt the shipping giant's schedule
for weeks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   SSA has been the target of demonstrations this week by the union,
which says SSA has taken a hard line during negotiations and is
holding up an agreement. The SSA and several other PMA members denied
there was a split, and that all members are insisting on greater
productivity and efficiency at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   For retailers, any disruption in cargo traffic could not come at a
worse time.</TE>
<TE>   "My members are going to be very upset," said Robin Lanier,
executive director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition, which
represents major retailers and manufacturers that use the ports.
"This is a strike without declaration."</TE>
<TE>   Lanier said she would meet with coalition members today and urge
them to "use back channels" to ask union-friendly political leaders
to intervene with the union.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between the PMA and the union continued through the
day's drama, with a subcommittee meeting on the difficult issue of
introducing labor-saving technology. The union has said it would
accept job losses associated with new technology, such as optical
scanning equipment that eliminates some clerical jobs, but wants the
shipping lines to move some nonunion planning jobs into union
jurisdiction. The association has refused.</TE>
<TE>   In the event of a strike, the Bush administration has indicated
that it probably would declare a national emergency and invoke the
Taft-Hartley Act, which would delay a strike for 80 days.</TE>
<TE>   At a Los Angeles appearance Wednesday, U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine
Chao told Reuters that she hoped "it will not come to that" and that
the two sides could come to terms.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge has rejected a writer's claims that she was
plagiarized by "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling and in turn fined
her $50,000, saying she perpetuated a fraud.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Allen G. Schwartz found only minimal
similarities between the multimillion-selling fantasy series and
books by author Nancy Stouffer.</LD>
<LD>   "The court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that Stouffer
has perpetuated a fraud ... through her submission of fraudulent
documents as well as through her untruthful testimony," the judge
wrote in an opinion dated Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling was a summary judgment on claims and counterclaims
dating back to 1999 between Stouffer and Rowling and her
representatives, including Rowling's U.S. publisher, Scholastic
Corp., and Time Warner Entertainment Co., which owns film and
merchandising rights.</TE>
<TE>   "We never had any doubt that Harry Potter and his world came from
the rich and extraordinary imagination of J.K. Rowling," Scholastic
President Barbara Marcus said.</TE>
<TE>   Stouffer's attorney, Thomas McNamara, said he was considering new
filings. "We were surprised and disappointed with the decision," he
said. "We were particularly troubled by the court's determination
that she submitted falsified evidence. She adamantly denies that."</TE>
<TE>   Stouffer, of Camp Hill, Pa., has said she wrote several books in
the 1980s, including "The Legend of Rah and the Muggles," and a
series of "Larry Potter" stories. On her Web site
(www.realmuggles.com), she said each title had a first printing of
100,000, and sold out within a week.</TE>
<TE>   Rowling's first Potter book, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
Stone," came out in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "Rah and the Muggles" and some "Larry Potter" books were released
last year by Thurman House, which has since gone out of business.
Schwartz questioned whether Stouffer created her "Larry Potter"
character before Rowling's series debuted.</TE>

<HD>Rosie O'Donnell Quits Namesake Magazine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosie O'Donnell packed up her name Wednesday and walked out on the
magazine business.</LD>
<LD>   After feuding for months with the publisher of Rosie magazine, the
former talk show host said her editorial control was being diminished
by executives whom she accused of smearing her reputation.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot have my name on a magazine if I cannot be assured that
it will represent my vision and ideas," O'Donnell said in a
statement.</LD>
<TE>   It was a stunning conclusion to one of the few success stories in
a depressed magazine industry. Although lampooned by some, the
magazine simply named Rosie offered a quirky mix of features that
reflected O'Donnell's outsize personality and struck a chord with
30-to 45-year-old working women and mothers.</TE>
<TE>   What started out as a blissful 50-50 venture between O'Donnell and
the Gruner &amp; Jahr USA Publishing unit of Bertelsmann--the world's
fifth-largest media company--turned nasty in recent months. Sources
leaked word of internal fights over features, cover stories and
personnel changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is truly shocking and disappointing that Rosie O'Donnell would
walk away from her obligations to her staff, her business partner and
her magazine audience," said the publisher's chief marketing officer,
Cindy Spengler. "In doing so, she destroys the value of the business
we created and violates the conditions of our binding contract."</TE>
<TE>   With the November issue already at the printers, the last issue of
Rosie will be the December issue. No decision has been made
concerning the magazine's 200 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The tumult underscores the dangers inherent in building a magazine
around a celebrity. The magazines carrying homemaking celebrity
Martha Stewart's name are going through a similar upheaval as their
namesake labors under allegations that she profited from illegal
insider stock tips.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of turning around a dying publication in the
current industry environment underscores the magnitude of the loss to
Gruner &amp; Jahr. In its earlier incarnation, Rosie was the 125-year-old
McCall's magazine, which was losing $2 million a month. Rosie the
publication had narrowed its losses to less than $1 million a year
and boasted more than 3.5 million readers, according to the
publisher.</TE>
<TE>   But there were some indications that the behind-the-scenes
upheaval at Rosie may have begun to take its toll in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of news stories this summer chronicling rising
tensions between O'Donnell and Gruner &amp; Jahr, newsstand sales have
been falling from the magazine's debut of 550,000 issues to as low as
200,000, according to publishing industry sources.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers, however, have privately speculated that the
decline in circulation reflects O'Donnell's mismanagement of the
magazine and her refusal to collaborate with more senior magazine
veterans looking to soften the magazine's image.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell insisted that readers turned to her for honesty, not the
upbeat features typical of other women's magazines. She accused those
critics of a smear campaign, leaking her questionable suggestions for
cover profiles--convicted rapist Mike Tyson, for one--and hiring
family and friends.</TE>
<TE>   "Nasty and untrue things about me began appearing in the press--as
you all know," O'Donnell said in her statement Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge of creating a new kind of woman's magazine seemed
daunting to some--impossible to others, but never to me," O'Donnell
said. "I wanted to create a magazine that spoke honestly to other
women.... We did it."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's up to the lawyers that both sides have hired to decide
who will pay for its demise.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors in an Enron Corp. partnership improperly won a court order
freezing $3.8 million belonging to former Enron executive Michael
Kopper after he pleaded guilty to criminal charges last month,
federal prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   They asked a Delaware judge to lift a restraining order obtained
by members of the LJM2 Co-Investment partnership, clearing the way
for the government to take possession of the money.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors had claimed the money as part of Kopper's plea
agreement and that takes precedence, Assistant U.S. Atty. Paulette
Nash said in court papers.</LD>
<TE>   LJM2 was among the partnerships used to hide Enron debt, financial
maneuvering that led to the company's bankruptcy filing in December.</TE>

shoppers and smokers.</LD>

0.3% in August from the previous month, the Labor Department
reported. The advance followed a tiny 0.1% rise in July.</LD>

increase many analysts were predicting, but it did not alarm

<LD>* Circuit City Group said its fiscal second-quarter earnings rose 34%
to $9.11 million, or 4 cents a share, helped by higher net income at
its CarMax used-car unit, which will be spun off next month. Sales
rose 10% to $2.22 billion.</LD>
<LD>   * Clorox Co. raised its fiscal first-quarter earnings estimate
because of cost cuts and sales of more profitable items. Profit is
expected to be 52 cents to 55 cents a share, up from its earlier
forecast of 50 cents to 52 cents.</LD>
<LD>   * Lockheed Martin Corp. and a BAE Systems unit have agreed to pay
the government $6.2 million to settle a lawsuit over a U.S. Navy
contract, the Justice Department said. The case is based upon a
whistle-blower's claim that parts for rudders on F/A-18 Hornet
fighter planes didn't meet performance requirements. Lockheed said
the settlement is not an admission of guilt.</LD>
<TE>   * Tower Records, the closely held seller of compact discs at 171
stores and on the Internet, named turnaround specialist Betsy Burton
interim chief executive of the family-run company. MTS Inc., which
does business as Tower Records, said Russ Solomon, founder and
chairman, will step down and become chairman emeritus.</TE>

<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp. said third-quarter profit will be a
fifth of what it had forecast as corporations slash spending on
computer-services contracts. The announcement sent EDS shares down
34% in extended trading and pulled down shares of its rivals.</LD>
<LD>   EDS, the world's No. 2 seller of computer services, said sales
will be $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion, down as much as 5% from a year
ago, and profit will come in at 12 cents to 14 cents a share, rather
than the 74 cents it had expected.</LD>
<LD>   Fourth-quarter sales and earnings also will miss estimates, the
company said.</LD>
<TE>   EDS closed down $1.30 at $36.46 on the New York Stock Exchange

<LD>   CBS picked up "My Big Fat Greek Family," based on the current
hit movie "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," as a midseason series for early
next year.</LD>
<LD>   The show will be headlined by the film's star and screenwriter Nia
Vardalos, a CBS spokesman said. Brad Grey Television (HBO's "The
Sopranos") and Sony Pictures Television will produce the series in
association with Playtone Pictures, the endeavor of superstar Tom
Hanks and Gary Goetzman, and Hank's wife, Rita Wilson, who championed
turning Vardalos' one-woman show into a movie.</LD>
<LD>   According to Grey, whose management company also represents
Vardalos, "We've put all the original cast together" for the series
with the exception of male lead John Corbett, "who has another series
commitment."</LD>
<TE>   CBS had passed on ordering the show for its upcoming fall season

<LD>Ingram Micro Inc. of Santa Ana said it will have third-quarter profit

<HD>Capital Spending Slump Drags Tech, Telecom Lower</HD>
<DH>Securities: The sectors still have more negatives than
positives, analysts say. Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks now
trade at less than $1 per share.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new wave of heavy selling is driving major technology and telecom
stocks to multiyear lows, dashing hopes that the bottom finally has
been reached in the sectors.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, stocks including Lucent Technologies Inc., Nortel
Networks Corp., EMC Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. fell to new
lows in active trading, with former high-fliers Lucent and Nortel now
fetching less than $1 a share. Others, including Intel Corp. and Sun
Microsystems Inc., touched new lows before rallying back slightly
with the broad market.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say the continuing poor fundamentals for tech--especially
the plunge in capital spending by businesses--are driving more
investors to give up hope of a rebound in the shares.</LD>
<TE>   "Tech remains a wasteland," said Erik Gustafson, manager of
Liberty Growth Stock fund in Chicago. "It's awful across the spectrum
because companies simply are not spending on technology. If anything,
they're still cutting back."</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, computer services giant Electronic Data Systems
slashed its outlook for third-quarter earnings, saying client
spending has crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent last week gave a bearish forecast, Oracle Corp.'s earnings
report Tuesday was dismal, and Cisco Systems Inc. said Wednesday that
its order backlog on Sept. 9 was 30% below year-earlier levels.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, brokerage Salomon Smith Barney cut the tech sector
to "underweight" from "market weight," saying "we see little reason
for investors to think the bad news is over with."</TE>
<TE>   Corporate managers will need to see evidence of a lasting profit
recovery before committing to significant capital expenditures, and
that may not occur until the second quarter of 2003, Salomon
investment strategist Tobias Levkovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Tech stocks' inability to mount a sustained rally also is a
reminder of the so-called technical factors working against
them--especially the huge number of shares bought at higher prices,
known as "overhead supply."</TE>
<TE>   "One reason recovery can take so long is that virtually every
shareholder is underwater," said John Bollinger, head of Bollinger
Capital Management Inc. in Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent, for instance, which topped $63 in late 1999, is still
among the more widely held stocks in America, Bollinger said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people aren't going to wait to get whole on these former
market leaders," Bollinger said. "They're going to use any bounce as
a reason to get out, or they may finally just sell out of disgust.
They don't want to see [the stocks] on their statement anymore."</TE>
<TE>   With the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index down 75% from its March
2000 peak, some investors are sitting on breathtaking losses.</TE>
<TE>   Many portfolio managers say they are reluctant to fight tech's
downward momentum, despite the possibility that some stocks are
long-term bargains. "It's like trying to catch a falling knife. With
some of these stocks I don't know where the bottom is," said John
Rutledge, manager of Evergreen Technology Fund in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Many pros say investors still banking on the market's former
leaders are likely to be disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   "Investors have to be very cautious when it comes to traditional
technology companies," Rutledge said. He said he likes
service-oriented companies, such as First Data Corp., that aren't
dependent on capital spending.</TE>
<TE>   But EDS' warning Wednesday showed that even service firms may be
vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Gustafson said one tech-related sector with healthy fundamentals
is defense. He said companies such as L-3 Communications Holdings
Inc. can thrive in an era of "heightened global tension."</TE>
<TE>   But for the most downtrodden tech names, survival may be a
struggle, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent and Nortel, for example, could get delisting warnings from
the New York Stock Exchange if their average closing prices are below
$1 for 30 consecutive trading days, according to the Big Board's
rules. Rutledge said some hard-hit tech and telecom firms may follow
AT&amp;T Corp.'s recent lead and propose reverse stock splits to boost
stock prices.</TE>

<HD>World Agency Warns on Trade Imbalance</HD>
<DH>Economy: The IMF says a chronic deficit in the U.S. and
surpluses elsewhere could lead to a painful correction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The combination of a huge U.S. trade deficit and big surpluses in
other countries cannot be sustained for long, the International
Monetary Fund said Wednesday, and governments should begin preparing
for a potentially painful adjustment.</LD>
<LD>   IMF economists said America's trade shortfall and Japan's surplus
have risen sharply; Japan "exports" about 1.5% of the world's total
savings, they said, while the United States is attracting 6%. Those
extremes, along with substantial trade surpluses in Europe,
ultimately are unsustainable, IMF analysts said in a report being
issued before the annual gathering of IMF and World Bank officials
this month.</LD>
<LD>   The inevitable correction will involve a significant decline in
the value of the dollar, they said, and could trigger a global
economic downturn if the adjustment occurs too quickly.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a risk that they'll be reversed rapidly and lead to large
changes in financial markets that could have broader consequences,"
IMF Chief Economist Kenneth Rogoff said.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF released its analysis as the Commerce Department reported
that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly in July, falling to
$34.6 billion from $36.8 billion the previous month. The change
reflected a decline in imports coupled with an increase in exports,
particularly U.S.-made autos.</TE>
<TE>   The improvement exceeded expectations, causing some analysts to
increase their estimates of third-quarter economic growth. But they
said it did not signal a fundamental change in America's propensity
to buy more imported goods and services than it is able to sell in
foreign markets. Imports declined in part because fears of a West
Coast dockworkers strike had accelerated purchases in previous
months, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one month's numbers, and these numbers jump around quite a
bit," Goldman Sachs senior economist Jan Hatzius said. "I still think
we're going to see larger rather than smaller trade deficits going
forward. The dollar would need to depreciate a lot further for that
to turn around."</TE>
<TE>   After appreciating 40% over a seven-year period, the dollar began
declining in value this year as foreign investors lost some of their
enthusiasm for acquiring U.S. assets. It has fallen about 3%, and
some analysts expect bigger declines.</TE>
<TE>   A decline in the dollar has a mixed effect on the U.S. economy.
Prices of imported goods rise, reducing living standards somewhat and
possibly rekindling inflation. At the same time, American goods and
services become more affordable to foreign buyers, creating growth in
export-oriented businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Although some economists say a gradual depreciation would be good
for the United States, they acknowledge that a sharp correction could
cause stock prices to plummet and interest rates to rise, possibly
tipping the country into another recession.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF has expressed concern about the negative implications of
America's chronic trade deficits, which have increased the nation's
net foreign debt to about 20% of its gross domestic product. Few
countries have been able to sustain foreign debts of that magnitude
for long.</TE>
<TE>   But the international lending agency said its new analysis goes a
step further by assessing the combined effect of the big trade
deficit in this country and the big surpluses in Japan and Europe.
It's not a pretty picture, it said.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, the decline in U.S. purchases of foreign goods that
would accompany a depreciating dollar would be offset by an increase
in demand for U.S. goods by other countries. But under current
circumstances, that mitigating effect could be short-circuited by
structural problems in the surplus nations, such as Japan's banking
crisis and Europe's labor policies.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, it has to unwind, and the healthiest way for it to
unwind would be by having stronger growth in the other regions,"
Rogoff said. The prescription for growth would include labor market
reforms in Europe and banking sector reforms in Japan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   IMF economists said Washington could reduce the potential for a
sharp and painful depreciation by reducing deficit spending, which
tends to undermine confidence in the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   The trade deficit analysis is part of the agency's global economic
forecast, which will be presented in the Sept. 28 and 29 joint
meetings of the IMF and World Bank.</TE>

<HD>Slick Ads Won't Sell the U.S. Message to Arabs, Report
Warns</HD>
<DH>Policy: The head of a presidential panel says Madison
Avenue is the wrong road to take.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SONNI EFRON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Madison Avenue-style advertising aimed at "selling" America to Middle
Eastern audiences isn't likely to work and could backfire, warned the
chairman of a presidential commission on public diplomacy.</LD>
<LD>   "There's more to America than Calvin Klein jeans--and that's the
point," said Harold C. Pachios, chairman of the U.S. Advisory
Commission on Public Diplomacy. "We are thought of as superficial, so
we need to avoid anything that smacks of the superficial."</LD>
<LD>   A report released Wednesday by the commission is the latest in a
series of efforts by think tanks and the Bush administration to shape
the U.S. approach to international audiences.</LD>
<TE>   The report concluded that if it wishes to win hearts and minds
abroad, the U.S. government will need to better focus its diplomatic
message, restructure its bureaucracy, listen much more to foreign
voices and aim its message at foreign publics and not just at the
foreign leaders who have been the traditional targets of American
diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   America will also need to spend more on communicating abroad,
after a decade of budget-cutting with the end of the Cold War, the
report concluded.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. spends $25 billion a year on traditional diplomacy and
$30 billion on intelligence and counterintelligence, but only $1
billion to inform and persuade international audiences, the report
said. That $1 billion is used for State Department information and
exchange programs and international broadcasting, including the Voice
of America.</TE>
<TE>   But funding for educational and cultural exchange programs has
fallen from $349 million in 1993 to $232 million last year, adjusted
for inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Many veteran diplomats regard those exchanges as crucial in
building goodwill abroad and showing international audiences that
America values more than materialism and pop culture.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people participating in cultural exchanges fell from
about 45,000 in 1995 to 29,000 last year, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   The public diplomacy commission was launched by President Truman
in 1948, but from the end of the Cold War to Sept. 11, its reports
have received little attention, said Pachios, a former deputy press
secretary to President Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   But Pachios said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is interested
in how America is perceived abroad because he understands the
importance of international public opinion in forming the coalitions
and partnerships that the U.S. seeks on Iraq and other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the State Department, the White House and the National
Security Council are all moving ahead with plans for a coordinated
strategy to tell America's story abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Undersecretary of State Charlotte Beers, an advertising executive
brought in after the Sept. 11 attacks to reshape America's marketing
campaign, is preparing to unveil a "total communication initiative"
for the Middle East, a State Department official said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The initiative will start in four to six weeks in eight Arab and
Muslim countries, and will involve television, print and radio
announcements and speakers and conferences, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Beers had been scheduled to announce the program Monday at the
National Press Club but canceled the appearance because she thought
the message would be lost amid the day's breaking news about Iraq's
willingness to resume United Nations weapons inspections, the source
said.</TE>
<TE>   The official scoffed at the suggestion that the initiative would
resemble a Calvin Klein-style advertising campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying not to 'advertise' but to initiate dialogue with
important opinion leaders in the Arab and Muslim world," the official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, TV clips will be part of our effort, but they are not going
to be advertisements for product."</TE>

<HD>Scotland Yard Charges Suspect in Terror Case</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Police have arrested a computer programmer and charged him with
collecting information that could be used to plan a terrorist attack,
Scotland Yard said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Abdullah Azam, 32, from Luton, 30 miles northwest of
London, was arrested Sunday and has been charged under the
anti-terrorism laws, a Scotland Yard official said on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   He said Azam had been charged with collecting information "of a
kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act
of terrorism, or had in his possession documents or records
containing information of that kind."</LD>
<TE>   The official would give no further details and said he had no
information about whether the suspect was linked to any specific
group or organization.</TE>
<TE>   Azam is due to appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court in London
today.</TE>
<TE>   Three other men, two age 21 and one age 23, also were arrested
Sunday in Luton under the Terrorism Act, but they were released
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 6, David Veness, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
squad, said there was no known specific threat to Britain and
encouraged people to carry on "business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't underestimate these individuals," he said. "An
individual is not incapable of causing serious impact and that is
something we are alert to. Our intention is to enhance the
deterrent."</TE>
<TE>   Security forces and police are better prepared to deal with any
terrorist attacks than they were a year ago, and his officers have
received advice from police in other countries that have more
experience with suicide bombers, he said.</TE>

<HD>Blair Softens Britons' Opposition to Iraq War</HD>
<DH>Europe: The premier appears to have turned public hostility
into a willingness to listen to the case for ousting Saddam Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM WALLACE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>When Britain's political establishment returned to work this month
from its collective summer hiatus, the prospect of the nation signing
on to a regime-altering war against Iraq seemed to be dim.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's bellicose rhetoric had rekindled some latent
anti-American instincts in Britain. While Prime Minister Tony Blair
spent August on vacation, the country's pacifist camp took the stage,
with some of the loudest protests coming from members of the ruling
Labor Party.</LD>
<LD>   "The government was not in the driving seat of the argument,"
acknowledged Peter Mandelson, a close advisor to Blair. "The prime
minister had to get back to work to put his stamp firmly on the
issue."</LD>
<TE>   He has done so in fine fashion, if recent polls are to be
believed.</TE>
<TE>   With his customary ease in political affairs, Blair appears to
have choked off the growing hostility to a war and persuaded the
public to at least listen to the case for ousting Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's most audacious act was to march into an antiwar den--in
this case, a gathering last week of union leaders--and leave those
inside politely thanking him for his views.</TE>
<TE>   Whether he can maintain that momentum following Hussein's offer
Monday to readmit weapons inspectors to Iraq is another question.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's response Wednesday to the overture was renewed insistence
that the United Nations "keep up the pressure." But he also stopped
short of dismissing the usefulness of inspections.</TE>
<TE>   That is still not enough for many of the more left-wing Labor
backbenchers in Parliament. According to the dissenters, as many as
100 antiwar lawmakers may register their disapproval during a one-day
debate on Iraq to be held Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   That will not topple a government that enjoys a cushy majority.
But the racket may resonate with the many Britons who want Hussein
contained but prefer to see it done under U.N. auspices rather than
by Washington and London alone.</TE>
<TE>   Mandelson acknowledges that the debate in Parliament will probably
be a fiesta of dissent that will produce a "lot of noise." But, he
predicted, "it will change nothing in government policy."</TE>
<TE>   Blair has made it clear throughout his time in office that on
major security issues, Britain's place is at Washington's side. Even
his opponents in the Tory opposition and conservative press
acknowledge that he is formidable at selling that stance when he
turns his mind to it.</TE>
<TE>   More evidence came this week in a poll by the respected ICM
Research organization showing that opposition to a military attack on
Iraq had fallen by 10 percentage points in three weeks, to 40% of
respondents. Meanwhile, support for using force to remove Hussein
rose by 3 percentage points to 36%, with others saying they are still
open to persuasion.</TE>
<TE>   The shift in numbers coincided with Blair's reentry into the
debate. Hostility to a war had been high, argues Nick Sparrow of ICM
Research, "because nobody had made the case for the military option
before, and people don't go voting for war when there doesn't seem to
be a good reason."</TE>
<TE>   Those closer to Blair point out a more subtle change in strategy
in order to push the numbers their way. The key, they note, was to
get the public focus off President Bush and the war talk coming out
of the U.S. government, and onto an issue they could sell more easily
at home: Hussein's record of chronic broken promises to the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "For someone in the Labor Party who is on board with Tony over
Iraq, the biggest problem I see is George Bush's language--that brash
cowboy approach--and the general position of the U.S. right-wingers,"
said Clive Soley, a lawmaker and former party chairman whose
closeness to Blair stems from long, private discussions on the role
of morality and religion in politics. "The British are generally more
liberal than Americans, and Bush's body language is a turnoff for
people here."</TE>
<TE>   Hostility to Bush was particularly palpable early this month. It
pulsed through a Sky News TV network poll in the week before the
Sept. 11 anniversary, when respondents named Bush a greater threat to
world peace than Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   And the numbers showed Bush dragging Blair down with him.
Pollsters at Market &amp; Opinion Research International, or MORI, who
have tracked public views on Blair's handling of the war on terrorism
over the past year, reported his approval rating sliding steadily
downward in tandem with the president's. Two weeks ago, for the first
time, MORI found a majority of respondents disapproving of Blair's
leadership on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Characteristically, Blair responded by taking the argument to his
critics.</TE>
<TE>   His opening counterattack, a Sept. 9 news conference held in the
north of England, showed none of the sentimentality he frequently
adopts to justify Britain's support for Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he personalized Britain's quarrel with the Iraqi leader,
a tactic more closely associated with hawks in the Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think from some of the discussion [that] we were
dealing with some benign liberal democracy out in Iraq," Blair said
dismissively. The Iraqi leader, he declared, fronts a brutal,
dictatorial regime.</TE>
<TE>   It was also necessary to remind the British public that Iraq was
making a mockery of the world body, say Blair's advisors. "It is not
an issue of getting U.N. political cover," Mandelson explained in an
interview this week. "This is as much a challenge to the U.N., a
matter of whether it is going to play an effective and responsible
role, and whether people are ready to uphold the U.N.'s authority."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy seemed to be working, at least until Hussein's offer
on inspections. Baghdad's concession may fall short of meeting its
U.N. obligations, noted John Chipman, director of the International
Institute of Strategic Studies in London. "But," he said, "it will
make the American and British stand-firm line a much tougher sell."</TE>
<TE>   The main difficulty lies with those in Britain who chafe at seeing
their prime minister snuggling too close to Washington. Even those
not hostile to Washington have taken to asking what Blair is getting
in return for his support. There has been persistent carping that
support for the Bush-declared war on terrorism has not produced
tangible benefit for Britain.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there was no exemption for British companies from
Washington's new steel tariffs. There were highly visible snubs on
issues that carry particular cachet among Blair's constituencies,
such as the Kyoto treaty on climate change and the nascent
International Criminal Court. And then there was a failure to
persuade Bush to join a multilateral effort to fight poverty in
Africa, an issue on which Blair has stuck his neck out.</TE>
<TE>   "He tells us he raises those issues when he goes to Washington,"
said Justin Forsyth, the policy director of Oxfam in London, who has
met with Blair to lobby for increased Western aid and trade
concessions for Africa. "But he certainly hasn't had any payback from
Bush for his loyalty."</TE>
<TE>   What Blair's positioning does bring, his supporters tirelessly
argue, is a chance to whisper the British view at the highest levels
of the Bush administration. A U.S. official says that "what Blair
gets out of all this is a 'first among equals' voice in the gathering
action."</TE>
<TE>   But whether prestige is enough to satisfy critics at home remains
uncertain in the long run. Blair "will have to carry this almost
entirely by himself," said Mandelson, who suggests that there should
be "no doubt about his ability to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But others worry that Blair may get the calibration between
friendship and supplication to America wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to Iraq," said Soley, the Labor lawmaker, "Tony
takes the view that since the U.S. is strong enough to do it on its
own, you can either walk away frustrated, or get involved and see
what influence you can bring." But Soley said the chosen path is a
high-risk strategy that could still end in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "If the whole project goes terribly wrong," he said, "Tony will
pay a very, very high price."</TE>

first trip out of the country since he returned in April after 29
years of exile in Italy.</LD>
<LD>   An aide said the former king travels annually to France to see his
doctor and will return to Afghanistan in 10 to 12 days.</LD>
<LD>   Zaher Shah, 87, has kept a low profile since returning to
Afghanistan. He had lived in Italy with his family since 1973, when

<LD>The U.S. Embassy in Caracas warned Venezuelans against any violent
effort to topple President Hugo Chavez, who survived a two-day coup
in April.</LD>
<LD>   The embassy said the U.S. government was concerned about rumors
and ads in local media urging Venezuela's military to oust the
"constitutional and democratically elected government of Venezuela."</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration drew criticism after seeming to acquiesce
in Chavez's temporary ouster. U.S. officials have said the
administration recognizes Chavez as Venezuela's legitimate president.</LD>

Serbia's presidential election after a state commission complied with
a court ruling allowing the candidacy.</LD>
<LD>   Serbia's election commission declared Nebojsa Pavkovic a candidate
for the Yugoslav republic's top job, overturning its earlier
dismissal of his candidacy because he had failed to get the required
10,000 signatures. The Serbian Supreme Court had ruled that the
commission failed to consider a complaint Pavkovic filed against the

<LD>Former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos is not only accused of
embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars, but he might have spilled
the world's priciest cup of coffee, a state attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   "One time, Montesinos lost $1 million when he carelessly spilled
his cup of coffee on a bank certificate, which was ruined. From then
on, he put his money in bank accounts," said Luis Vargas, who heads
the case against Montesinos. In Peru, bank certificates are used like
cash and cannot be replaced.</LD>
<LD>   Montesinos is accused of piling up an illegal fortune of more than
$250 million. Vargas said the coffee accident was one reason
Montesinos began depositing ill-obtained money in bank accounts.</LD>

<HD>Austria's Far-Right Haider May Be Out of National
Politics--for Now</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party chose a low-profile minister
to become its leader after Haider declined to seek a return to his
old post, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Transport Minister Mathias Reichhold, 45, yielded to calls from
leaders of the party three days before its convention and a week
after its pullout from a government coalition, which forced coming
elections.</LD>
<LD>   "Reichhold is the right man at the right time in the right place,"
said Martin Strutz, a member of the party executive committee that
nominated the organic farmer.</LD>
<TE>   Reichhold had resigned his government post, as did party members
Vice Chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer and Finance Minister Karl-Heinz
Grasser, amid a dispute with Haider, who headed a grass-roots revolt
over a delayed tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   The resignations led to the collapse of the 2 1/2-year-old
government coalition between the Freedom Party and the conservative
People's Party.</TE>
<TE>   Haider on Saturday quit the race for the party leadership, saying
his family was threatened because of his campaign against the
government's plan to spend $1.8 billion for new fighter planes.</TE>
<TE>   Party officials had agreed last week to make Haider the leader, a
position he left in 2000 when the Freedom Party joined the government
as its junior partner.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Reichhold's candidacy appeared to seal, for the
moment at least, Haider's exit from national politics.</TE>
<TE>   If so, it would mark the demise of Austria's most enigmatic
politician in recent years. The populist leader, who led the Freedom
Party to a second-place finish in 1999 elections, drew international
ire for flattering comments he made about the Nazi regime, remarks
for which he later apologized.</TE>
<TE>   Haider has repeatedly declared his withdrawal in spats with his
party only to return at their urging. But there is little time for an
about-face before the convention elects Reichhold as chairman.</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Questions German</HD>
<DH>Asia: Officials probe possible link to an Arab who
allegedly planned attacks on U.S. targets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Indonesian police said Wednesday that they are questioning a German
man of Arab descent over connections to an Arab who allegedly planned
attacks on U.S. targets in Southeast Asia and has been linked to the
Al Qaeda terrorist organization.</LD>
<LD>   National police spokesman Saleh Saaf said the German, whom he
declined to identify, was initially detained in Jakarta, the capital,
for immigration offenses. He said police intelligence began
questioning him Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Indonesia confirmed Wednesday that the other Arab, Omar Faruq, who
most security sources say is a Kuwaiti, was arrested in Indonesia in
June and handed over to U.S. authorities. Faruq told U.S. officials
of a plot to attack American embassies in the region.</LD>
<TE>   Indonesian National Police Chief Gen. Dai Bachtiar said a
preliminary investigation indicated that the detained man was linked
to Faruq. He said a search of the man's home yielded documents on
violence in Indonesia, but he did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   The tip from Faruq triggered the closure of several U.S. embassies
in the region, including that in Indonesia, the world's most populous
Muslim nation, around the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Saaf said the German was being held at an immigration detention
center. He declined to say if the man was directly linked to the
plots to attack U.S. targets in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has been criticized for being Southeast Asia's weak link
in the war on terror. Though it has cooperated on capturing
foreigners, it has avoided going after local militants, partly out of
fear of upsetting moderate Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian armed forces chief Gen. Endriartono Sutarto said the
military was following up on information provided by Faruq. He
confirmed for the first time that Faruq was arrested in June and had
been handed over to U.S. officials.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Makes Case for War</HD>
<DH>Congress: Iraqi regime is world's greatest threat, he tells
lawmakers. U.N. remains unconvinced.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Seeking congressional support for a war President Bush says he has
not yet decided to wage, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told
lawmakers Wednesday that Iraq poses the greatest threat to global
stability.</LD>
<LD>   In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Rumsfeld
told lawmakers that the United Nations already has ample evidence to
take forceful action against the regime of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld's testimony provided the Bush administration's strongest
statement since Iraq offered Monday to allow in international weapons
inspectors of why the U.S. wants much more from Hussein's regime. It
came as the White House was preparing a draft resolution supporting
military action that was to go to lawmakers as early as today.</LD>
<TE>   Congressional sources who have discussed the matter with the
administration say they expect Bush to request broad authority to
take military and other action if Hussein does not dismantle Iraq's
capacity to make and deploy weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a straight authorization for the use of force,
and they will resist efforts to add conditions," said a senior aide
to the House Republican leadership. "We will make it as broad as
possible and give the president as much latitude as possible. If the
Democrats have a problem with that, they don't have a lot of wiggle
room."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said, however, that he
expected the resolution to focus on the aim of eliminating Iraq's
weapons capability rather than on ousting Hussein--the latter a more
controversial goal in the international community Bush is trying to
court.</TE>
<TE>   Lott said the U.S. was still intent on forcing Hussein from power.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of waning international support for military action,
Rumsfeld addressed criticisms and questions about why Washington now
insists that Iraq looms as the world's gravest danger. Point by
point, he cataloged Hussein's pursuit of chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons and the Iraqi leader's willingness to use them.</TE>
<TE>   "No terrorist state poses a greater and more immediate threat to
the security of our people and the stability of the world than the
regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq," he told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony, Rumsfeld said the administration's focus on Iraq
will not detract from its declared worldwide campaign against
terrorism. Fewer than 20% of major combat units are performing war
duty now, he told the committee.</TE>
<TE>   And he challenged the suggestion that war should follow only a
"smoking gun" that links Hussein to terrorism or another use of
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing we want is a smoking gun," Rumsfeld said. "A gun
smokes after it has been fired. The goal must be to stop Saddam
Hussein before he fires a weapon of mass destruction against our
people."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also dismissed Iraq's offer to let U.N. weapons
inspectors return without conditions, an overture that Russia, France
and Arab nations have seized on as a means to slow Washington's march
toward war. Diplomats at the United Nations argue that the U.S.
should hold its fire until Iraq interferes with the world body's
attempts to disarm the country.</TE>
<TE>   If failure to comply with weapons inspections represents a casus
belli needed to justify military action, "the U.N. already has it,"
Rumsfeld said. "Iraq's noncompliance with U.N. inspection regimes has
been going on for more than a decade. What else can one ask for?"</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's appearance was briefly interrupted when two female
protesters began chanting "Inspections, not war." They held up a
banner with the same message before being escorted from the room by
Capitol Hill police.</TE>
<TE>   Bush reinforced Rumsfeld's message after a meeting with
congressional leaders in which he urged a quick vote to authorize a
possible military strike.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein has stiffed the United Nations for 11 long years,"
Bush said. "He deceives. He delays. He denies. And the United States,
and I'm convinced, the world community, aren't going to fall for that
kind of rhetoric by him again."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Bush's confidence that world leaders would rally behind
Washington, diplomats at the U.N. expressed frustration with
Washington's bellicose line. The world body, they said, was founded
to be an instrument to keep the peace, not to wage war.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has to wait "until we have a full debate here to
make our own judgment," said Ambassador Jagdish Koonjul from
Mauritius, a member of the Security Council, which will decide what
action, if any, the U.N. will take against Iraq. "The return of
inspectors is something the whole international community has been
calling for, and now we've got that.</TE>
<TE>   "If we hear, even in the very first two days, that they can't do
their work, then we will take action," he added. "But we should not
create a situation where it will be impossible for them to work at
all."</TE>
<TE>   In the face of resistance from Russia, France and especially Syria
on the Security Council, U.S. and British officials began work
Wednesday on a new resolution authorizing the use of force against
Iraq. The text is expected to list requirements for Iraq's compliance
on a range of other U.N. measures that include respecting human
rights, renouncing terrorism and giving up black market
trade--elements that critics say add additional tripwires for Iraq's
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 15 Security Council members, 12 have indicated that they
would like the inspectors to have a chance to resume their search for
hidden weapons programs in Iraq before the international community
resorts to force. Colombia may side with the U.S. and Britain. A
resolution needs nine votes--and no vetoes from any of the five
permanent members--to pass.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain expect to introduce the measure next week,
which means an interim of intensified lobbying and arm-twisting in
U.N. corridors and foreign capitals.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have the noises about military action because that's
the only thing that has gotten us to this point," said a British
diplomat who requested anonymity. "The Iraqis only opened the door
with a gun to their heads. The threat of military action will be
needed at every stage of the process for Iraq to make the right
decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri asked for a last-minute meeting
Wednesday evening with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
world body's chief weapons inspector, Hans Blix, to pledge his
government's full cooperation with the inspections. Blix, who will
meet in about two weeks with Iraqi officials in Vienna to finalize
arrangements for the inspections, said he hoped that monitoring would
get off to a "flying start."</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Sabri pressed Iraq's own agenda in a brief statement to
reporters. He said he hoped that allowing the inspectors to return
"will lead to the eventual lifting of this brutal regime of
sanctions, which has been killing hundreds of thousands of our people
for the last 12 years." He added a defiant appeal for the U.N. to
avert attacks, asking that the Security Council respect "Iraq's
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence."</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz was even less
conciliatory, telling reporters that the U.S. concern about weapons
of mass destruction was merely a pretext for war and that Iraq hoped
the world would not "bow to the American blackmail."</TE>
<TE>   But in Washington, the drums of war beat on, as the president said
that he wanted Congress to display unity and vote on a congressional
resolution authorizing military force against Iraq before the U.N.
Security Council decided on a resolution of its own.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important signal for the world to see that this country
is united in our resolve to deal with threats that we face," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   In their comments, Bush and the congressional leaders suggested
that whatever differences they may have had in recent weeks about the
content or timing of a resolution had been swept aside.</TE>
<TE>   They agreed that a resolution offering support for the campaign
against Iraq should be acted on quickly, and that it would aim for
broad bipartisan backing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to work together, the four leaders and the president,
on that resolution, try to find appropriate language," House Speaker
J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) said after the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) agreed, saying the two
parties in Congress would work with the administration.</TE>

<DH>Asia: Tons of junked computer parts indicate a dangerous
trade is thriving despite action.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>Chinese customs officials seized 450 tons of junked computer parts
and other electronic waste shipped illegally from the United States,
an official said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure added to evidence that China's trade in imported
computer waste meant for recycling is thriving despite a crackdown
launched in May after reports of health dangers from unsafe handling.</LD>
<LD>   The 22 shipping containers full of electronic garbage were seized
this month in the port of Wenzhou in eastern China, a customs
official there said.</LD>
<TE>   The waste included computer monitors, keyboards, photocopy
machines and television sets, said the official, who would give only
his surname, Lin.</TE>
<TE>   He would not identify the companies involved or the U.S. port
where the ship originated. He said the case was under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Small Chinese companies, many of them in the southeast near Hong
Kong, tear apart derelict computers and other electronic items to
recover gold and other materials. Most workers have no protection
from the toxic fumes released when parts are melted down.</TE>
<TE>   China launched its crackdown after environmentalists early this
year called attention to health problems in the town of Guiyu, a
recycling center near Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   Guiyu residents told a reporter who visited the town that children
there suffered medical problems including breathing ailments and that
there had been a surge in leukemia cases.</TE>

<HD>A Nondescript Harbor for Wanted Men</HD>
<DH>Asia: Alleged Sept. 11 plotter and others seized in
Pakistan 'lived in a quiet fashion' in a Karachi building, neighbors
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>The building is a plain white concrete box on a commercial street in
the part of the city known as the Defense Section. The only
ornamental touch is the gray-tile facing on the corners. A more
nondescript setting in a more undistinguished area of this densely
packed metropolis is hard to imagine.</LD>
<LD>   It was here that Pakistani authorities tracked down one of the
world's most wanted men: Ramzi Binalshibh, the Yemeni who allegedly
sent money to the 19 hijackers who attacked the United States on
Sept. 11, and who might have been a hijacker himself if not
repeatedly denied a U.S. visa.</LD>
<LD>   One week after the raids that netted Binalshibh and 10 other Al
Qaeda suspects, police remain posted outside the chained and
padlocked entrance to No. C-63 15th St. Only a few passersby stop to
gape at its bullet-pocked facade.</LD>
<TE>   Even the beige curtains of the third-floor apartment where
Binalshibh was living are ripped and perforated by gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   On the balcony, someone has planted a Pakistani flag--a small
symbol of victory for what President Pervez Musharraf has hailed as
one of his country's greatest achievements in its battle against
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Through an open window, a plastic bag on the floor and a crushed
water bottle can be seen from a neighboring building, but the flat
itself has no visible furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say the Arabs who lived there apparently slept on
carpets, keeping few possessions--a sign that they may have moved
frequently.</TE>
<TE>   Zeshan, an employee at a public relations firm in an adjoining
building, said no one suspected that behind the curtains lived
"serious" terrorists. "We had no idea that they were foreigners and
Al Qaeda," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to the window facing their office 15 feet away, he said
that he and co-workers put up curtains out of politeness when they
noticed that the apartment had become inhabited three or four months
ago. They wanted to respect the privacy of the woman and two children
they could occasionally glimpse over there. Only once did he see the
man of the family; he appeared fair complexioned with a slight beard
and was of medium height.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment would not have been very expensive; flats on this
street go for less than $130.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors say that both the real estate agent who rented the
apartment and the building owner, a woman who lives in the suburbs,
have been taken into custody for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants "lived in a quiet fashion and never created any
problem," said Zeshan, who goes by one name.</TE>
<TE>   Nisar Shah, who lives in the building across the street, said the
second-floor apartment also was occupied, by six or seven youths of
foreign origin.</TE>
<TE>   He would see them occasionally at night playing cards on the roof,
where they had installed a large satellite dish, but he said they
almost never came out of the building during the day.</TE>
<TE>   Zeshan said last week's first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks
started normally for him. He arrived at work about 9:15 a.m. and
noticed nothing unusual on the street.</TE>
<TE>   About half an hour later, he heard two explosions and was stunned
to see 100 to 150 police officers in the street firing into the
neighboring building. At first, he thought that police had caught
robbers in the act at an electrical store. Soon the police, who
included members of Pakistan's elite paramilitary Rangers, had taken
up firing positions on nearby roofs.</TE>
<TE>   As authorities explained later, they had developed information
from a satellite phone interception that Al Qaeda suspects were
living in the building. When they went to arrest the inhabitants,
some suspects surrendered.</TE>
<TE>   The woman--barefoot, dressed in a white veil and a colorful
traditional dress--ran out of the building with her children before
being whisked off by police. But others inside responded by throwing
grenades that injured some of the police officers.</TE>
<TE>   After that, the police and Rangers launched tear-gar canisters and
opened fire in a gun battle that did not end until nearly 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who surrendered was Binalshibh, who was led out
blindfolded and dressed in a blue T-shirt. Later in the day, police
also brought out the corpses of two Al Qaeda suspects who had been
killed. The bodies, wrapped in bloodied sheets, were placed into an
ambulance to be taken to a morgue. Six police officers were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter who reached the roof opposite the building said that
after the battle, he could see one of those killed lying face down on
the floor as members of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence
agency, or ISI, riffled through a pouch of documents they took from
the top of an air-conditioning unit.</TE>
<TE>   The whole incident has left neighbors puzzled. What were the Al
Qaeda fugitives doing here? How were they traced to this spot? If
they were really desperate terrorists, why were they not able to put
up a more effective resistance?</TE>
<TE>   "Living in a commercial area like this, it is difficult to accept
that they were such wanted men," said Salim Mahmood, Zeshan's
employer at Media Strategists. "If I was one of them, I would not
have chosen a street on which over 1,000 cars pass every day, a place
where if you stick your head out you wind up in someone else's
window.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly speaking, it is all very curious."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Blast Kills Israeli, Ends a Lull in Suicide
Bombings</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A man blows himself up at a bus stop as he is
approached by police. Two other people die in separate attacks in
West Bank.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A bomber blew himself up Wednesday as he was approached by police at
a bus stop in northern Israel, killing a police officer. The attack
brought an end to the longest period without a suicide bombing this
year.</LD>
<LD>   At least two people--another police officer and a civilian--were
injured in the explosion. Authorities noted that the toll could have
been far higher had police not arrived before the attacker could
board a bus.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first suicide bombing in Israel since Aug. 4, when nine
people were killed and about 50 injured in an explosion on a bus in
northern Israel. Coming on a day in which two other Israelis were
found dead after separate attacks, apparently by Palestinians, it
seemed to burst any illusion that the relative calm of the last six
weeks was a precursor to peace.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't think this is over yet," said Supt. Gil Kleiman, a
police spokesman. He explained the six-week lull by saying that
authorities had simply been successful in foiling numerous attempted
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the lull has been without violence. Several dozen
people--soldiers and civilians--have died on both sides, with the
heavier toll falling on Palestinians. Most of the violence has been
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians are living under
Israeli military authority.</TE>
<TE>   Israel on Tuesday rejected a two-stage Palestinian cease-fire
proposal, which would have promised to halt attacks only on civilians
initially. Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said the proposal was
inadequate because it would allow continued attacks on soldiers, as
well as on Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, whom the
Palestinians view as combatants.</TE>
<TE>   Peres, however, said he was encouraged by efforts at the United
Nations to forge a peace agreement. On Tuesday, representatives of
the United States, Russia, the European Union and the U.N. presented
what they termed a "road map" to peace in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound optimistic," Peres said in an interview on
Israeli TV, "but it is a worthy, perhaps unprecedented effort."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks Wednesday came a day after a bomb exploded at a
Palestinian elementary school south of the West Bank city of Hebron,
injuring five children. Both Israeli and Palestinian authorities said
they believed the bombing was the work of Jewish militants and was
similar to two other incidents in recent months in which bombs were
planted at Palestinian schools.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered authorities to step up efforts
to find the school bombers, saying: "All forms of terrorism are
inhuman and immoral. There's no good terrorism and bad terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's suicide blast occurred shortly before 5 p.m. in the
Israeli Arab town of Umm al Fahm, the site of another such attack
earlier this year. According to a report on state-run television, the
police officers had been on their way to the scene of a car accident
when they passed the bus stop and saw a man who looked suspicious. As
they approached, the man detonated a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Kleiman said the dead police officer was a young Israeli, between
18 and 21 years old, who was doing his mandatory national service on
the police force rather than in the army.</TE>
<TE>   "We succeeded in foiling an attack, but unfortunately this cost
the life of a policeman," said Yaacov Borowsky, commander of the
Northern Police District.</TE>
<TE>   No group claimed responsibility for the attack. The bomber was not
immediately identified.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier attack Wednesday, one Israeli was killed and another
injured when the car they were driving was ambushed near the Jewish
settlement of Shaked, west of Jenin in the West Bank, authorities
said. The dead man was identified as Yosef Ajami, a construction
contractor from Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the military wing of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, claimed
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, the burned body of a 67-year-old Israeli, David
Bushbut, was found in a garbage dump in the West Bank town of
Azzariyeh, authorities said. He had been reported missing the night
before.</TE>
<TE>   Kleiman said investigators were "treating it as a terrorist
attack" but not ruling out other motives.</TE>

<HD>Britain to Appoint Violence Monitor for Northern Ireland</HD>
<DH>Europe: Move is aimed at bolstering peace process in the
province. Catholics decry what they call a return to blaming
republicans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Britain announced Wednesday that it would appoint a respected expert
to monitor violence in Northern Ireland, a move backed by the
province's Protestants but opposed by its Roman Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   Northern Ireland Secretary John Reid confirmed the move after a
meeting between British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Gerry Adams,
leader of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army.</LD>
<LD>   Many Protestants are demanding Sinn Fein's ouster from the joint
Catholic-Protestant government in Northern Ireland because of
mounting allegations that the IRA remains involved in violence.
Saturday, the Protestant leader of the coalition, First Minister
David Trimble, will face a difficult meeting of his Ulster Unionist
Party that is being convened to debate the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Adams said Britain appeared to be "returning to the old game of
bolstering unionists and pointing the finger of blame at
republicans."</TE>
<TE>   But Reid said that appointing a violence monitor would do much
more than shore up Trimble's position. The expert's findings, he
said, would help restore confidence in a peace process being assailed
by all of Northern Ireland's secret armed organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Reid said the expert, to be appointed within the next few weeks,
"will help to create a greater sense of openness and reinforce the
transition to a normal democratic society." He said the person picked
must be a respected expert in paramilitary violence.</TE>
<TE>   The threats from both extremes in Northern Ireland society were
evident Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   British soldiers dismantled two booby-trapped bombs found in a car
after police arrested two suspected IRA dissidents near Northern
Ireland's border with the Irish Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, leaders of two outlawed anti-Catholic groups met
in Protestant East Belfast to discuss a feud between senior members
over the proceeds from drug trafficking in the area. This month, the
feud between the Ulster Defense Assn. and the Loyalist Volunteer
Force has left one LVF man dead and a senior UDA leader wounded.</TE>

<HD>North Korea's Goodwill Gestures Spark Debate</HD>
<DH>Asia: Overtures are viewed with both relief and suspicion
by neighbors. A railroad project linking North and South begins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEMILITARIZED ZONE, South Korea</DL>
<LD>"Is North Korea ready for a new era of openness?" queried a large
front-page headline Wednesday here in the English-language Korea
Times.</LD>
<LD>   It is the question of the moment. From Seoul to Washington to
Tokyo, policymakers responsible for deciphering one of the world's
most inscrutable regimes are puzzling over whether North Korea is
sincere.</LD>
<LD>   Photographs under the headline showed North Korean leader Kim Jong
Il shaking hands with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
Another showed North and South Korean generals shaking hands after
clearing the way for work to connect the two nations' railroads.</LD>
<TE>   Yet another photo was of a husband and wife, estranged by the
political division of the Korean peninsula, tearfully embracing at a
round of family reunions.</TE>
<TE>   To those who want to believe that North Korea is mending its ways,
the photographs are incontrovertible evidence. In the last few weeks,
a flurry of developments would seem to augur positive change.</TE>
<TE>   The most notable was Kim's confession to Koizumi on Tuesday that
North Korea had kidnapped at least a dozen Japanese to assist its
spies--a surprising mea culpa from a regime that had indignantly
denied such charges for decades.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the burst of progress on the railroads through
the demilitarized zone dividing North and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   This morning, Koreans began clearing land mines in preparation for
laying the rail lines. The work started at the South's boundary
fence, where the South Korean railway system ends abruptly 10 feet
from a tangle of electrified barbed wire. For the first time since
the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War, nearly 100 South Korean
soldiers marched in the untrampled wilderness of the DMZ and, with
protective gear and heavy machinery, began clearing away half a
century's worth of mines.</TE>
<TE>   "This feels like the beginning of a new era. I am guardedly
optimistic," said U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Eddie L. Seaton Sr., who is
monitoring the railroad work for the U.N. commission that oversees
the armistice.</TE>
<TE>   The reconnecting of the railroads was agreed to in 2000 but had
been stalled by the North.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the largest delegation of North Koreans to visit the
South is expected next week in Busan for the Asian Games. In advance
of the games, the North's flag was raised Monday with those of other
participating nations, the first time such a thing has happened in
South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Even former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose name
became synonymous with reform, was sufficiently inspired by the
events of recent days to send North and South Korea congratulatory
messages.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem that the momentum toward perestroika is almost
impossible for even the hardest-line skeptics to dismiss.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I think there cannot be any doubt that North Korea
is on the verge of major changes," said Moon Chung In, a political
scientist in Seoul who is writing a book about relations between the
Koreas.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are many naysayers who believe that the outward signs
of progress are merely a crafty maneuver by North Korea's Kim. If he
can convince the Japanese of his sincerity, they say, he effectively
isolates the Bush administration in its hard line toward North Korea.
President Bush has labeled the North, together with Iran and Iraq, an
"axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans need to avoid the possibility that they could be
targeted by a preemptive U.S. military strike against the development
of weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, they may want to distract the world's attention from the
Bush administration's demand that they open the country to
international nuclear weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   "So far what Kim Jong Il has done is make some very adroit moves
that are tactical in nature," said Lee Chung Min of Seoul's Yonsei
University. "He wants to drive a wedge between the Bush
administration and its allies in Asia."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, it makes sense for North Korea to be on its best
behavior ahead of South Korea's presidential election Dec. 19. It
would like to see President Kim Dae Jung, architect of the "sunshine
policy" of engagement with the North, succeeded by someone
sympathetic--as well as generous with financial aid.</TE>
<TE>   The railroad is one of the South Korean president's pet projects.
Its big groundbreaking ceremonies with eloquent speeches and
fireworks could play well with voters. But a senior U.S. military
official says he would not be surprised if the North Koreans drag
their feet on starting their portion of the work on the other side of
the DMZ.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the matter of money from Tokyo. Lots of it.</TE>
<TE>   When Japan normalized relations with South Korea in 1965, it paid
$500 million in reparations for the occupation of the Korean
peninsula between 1910 and 1945. If North Korea gets a comparable
package, it could total more than $10 billion when adjusted for
inflation and accumulated interest.Even half that sum would be a
windfall for one of the world's poorest countries. It would be
especially welcome right now for Kim Jong Il, who is trying to
implement a daring package of price and economic reforms. A cash
infusion from the Japanese also would forestall the need to make
amends with the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Pyongyang eyes a big payday in reaching deal with Tokyo," read a
cynical headline in the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.</TE>
<TE>   Although many Japanese expressed outrage after the North Koreans
announced that eight of the 12 abducted civilians were dead, the
momentum appears to be for accepting North Korea's apology and moving
toward reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   An online poll by the Kyodo news agency found that 70% of
respondents believed the summit was a success.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible for the bereaved families, but it's a big step,"
said Michio Yanai, 44, a Tokyo businessman. "It's a serious problem
to have North Korea remain as a terrorist nation and isolated from
the international community."</TE>
<TE>   If Japan and North Korea normalize relations, as appears likely,
it will intensify the debate in Washington about how to handle North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In an initial reaction, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer
said Wednesday, "The president welcomes and supports Prime Minister
Koizumi's efforts in talking to the North Koreans."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer added that "North Korea's militaristic ways have made
[it] stand out alone, virtually alone in the world, and have now
caused them to hopefully reconsider and to work more productively
with their neighbors, rather than the isolationist path they've
chosen for themselves."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been watching the Koizumi trip closely
for clues about whether to send its own special envoy, Assistant
Secretary of State James A. Kelly, to North Korea in the coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is going to bring to a head in Washington the discussions
between the hawks and the doves," said Marcus Noland, a North Korea
expert with the Institute for International Economics in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was not willing to hazard an answer to the question of
whether North Korea is sincere, Noland said recent developments will
strengthen the hands of the doves within the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were a hard-liner, I would be very worried," he said.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Hails Arrest of Bombing Suspect</HD>
<DH>Asia: Man is accused of plotting to assassinate president
and of staging deadly consulate attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Police and intelligence officials said Wednesday that they had
arrested an Islamic militant who organized a June car bombing at the
U.S. Consulate here and was plotting to assassinate Pakistan's
president this week. He is also suspected of masterminding a May car
bombing in which 11 French engineers and three other people were
killed.</LD>
<LD>   Sharib Ahmad, 30, was arrested in this port city late Tuesday with
five other men, the officials said. Ahmad was identified by three
other suspects as the leader of the attack on the consulate, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   "For us, Sharib's arrest is what Osama bin Laden's capture [would
mean] for the Americans," a senior intelligence official said. "This
guy was on the loose with a single mission: to kill the president."</LD>
<TE>   Twelve Pakistanis were killed in the bombing, which heavily
damaged the fortified consulate. Karachi police said at the time that
the bomb was hidden in a vehicle parked outside the 10-foot-high wall
surrounding the building.</TE>
<TE>   The six militants captured Tuesday were found at a house in the
middle-class residential district of Dhoraji, less than a mile from
the site of a military exhibit that President Pervez Musharraf
attended Monday. The raid also yielded a large cache of weapons,
ammunition and explosives, including an antitank recoilless rifle.</TE>
<TE>   "In their sole aim to kill President Musharraf, these militants
had collected 70 hand grenades, 40 rocket-propelled grenades and
rockets and about [2,000 pounds] of bomb-making chemicals at their
hide-out in Karachi," said a ranking Karachi police official, who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, Musharraf's spokesman, on Wednesday
night acknowledged the arrest of "several terrorists and seizure of
weapons and ammunition," but he denied that the militants were
plotting to kill the president.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the six men were associated with
Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen al-Almi, a radical Islamic splinter group.
Police say the group was involved in a failed attempt to assassinate
Musharraf here in April by placing a car loaded with explosives on a
street where his motorcade was to pass. The May bombing, near the
Sheraton Hotel, led to an exodus of foreign diplomats, businessmen
and their families from Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   The French victims were engineers at France's state-owned naval
construction service, which was building a submarine purchased by
Pakistan. They were preparing to board a bus to go to work when the
bomb exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they believe that Islamic militants in Pakistan,
furious over Musharraf's decision to side with the United States in
its war against terrorism and its military campaign against the Al
Qaeda terrorist network and the former Taliban regime in Afghanistan,
are waging a campaign to destabilize his government. U.S. and other
Western citizens also have been targeted by militants.</TE>
<TE>   The militants arrested Tuesday were being questioned Wednesday by
a team of Pakistani police and intelligence officials.</TE>
<TE>   Police and intelligence officials said that those arrested this
week had deep ties to the Taliban and that the cache of arms and
ammunition had been moved to Karachi from Afghanistan in the last few
months.</TE>

<HD>Court Releases Vichy Official From Prison</HD>
<DH>Europe: French panel rules Maurice Papon, who deported Jews
to concentration camps during WWII, is too sick to serve out his
term.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Reopening a painful case about the persecution of Jews in France
during World War II, a court on Wednesday ordered the release for
medical reasons of Maurice Papon, 92, a former top Vichy official
convicted of deporting about 1,600 Jews to Nazi death camps.</LD>
<LD>   Papon walked out of the La Sante prison here after an appellate
court ruled that coronary ailments entitled him to benefit from a law
mandating the release of gravely ill inmates. He had been serving a
10-year sentence handed down in 1998 for crimes against humanity.</LD>
<LD>   The decision enraged relatives of his victims and other veterans
of a 17-year battle to punish a defiant, emblematic figure who
steadily accumulated power after the war, rising to become France's
budget minister in 1978. Papon used political connections to resist
prosecution, steadfastly denied guilt and even fled briefly to
Switzerland after his conviction.</LD>
<TE>   "This man has showed no remorse at all," said Shimon Samuels,
director of the Paris office of the Los Angeles-based Simon
Wiesenthal Center, which helped bring Papon to justice. "A court has
shown mercy for a man who showed none to his victims.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is important because it tests the collective memory of
France as a country of the Resistance versus France as a country of
collaborators," Samuels said. "The whole message of the trial has
been undercut."</TE>
<TE>   However, others argued that the three-judge panel correctly obeyed
a legal reform passed in March to protect old and sick convicts in
France's increasingly harsh penitentiaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Any other decision would be based on political, ideological or
emotional choices," the newspaper Le Monde declared in an editorial.
"The humanity of the law should benefit all. Even Maurice Papon."</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, the decision revived a still-delicate debate about
France's reluctance to confront the sins of the past. Papon was the
highest-ranking official of the Vichy government, the French wartime
regime that collaborated with Germany, to be convicted of crimes
related to the systematic roundup and extermination of Jews during
the Nazi occupation.</TE>
<TE>   During his six-month trial, the longest in French history, Papon
came to personify the bureaucrat-as-executioner.</TE>
<TE>   As a top police administrator in the Bordeaux region, he signed
papers between 1942 and 1944 authorizing the deportation of men,
women, children and the elderly, most of whom perished at the
Auschwitz death camp. The jury rejected his defense that he tried to
spare as many people as he could and that his entry into the French
Resistance was a mitigating factor.</TE>
<TE>   That change of sides propelled a stellar postwar career in the
government of President Charles de Gaulle. Papon served as a steely
police chief of Paris from 1958 to 1967, and then as a conservative
legislator before becoming budget minister under former President
Valery Giscard d'Estaing.</TE>
<TE>   As former President Francois Mitterrand once admitted publicly,
leaders interceded on Papon's behalf in the 1980s to obstruct
attempts to prosecute him.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's ruling was not Papon's first recent legal victory. In
April, a state administrative panel ruled that the government shared
blame for his wartime conduct and should provide half of about
$720,000 in damages he was ordered to pay victims' relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Despite calls from prominent politicians for Papon's release on
humanitarian grounds, President Jacques Chirac rejected three
requests for a pardon. That made the decision Wednesday by the judges
especially startling. They agreed with Papon's lawyers, who submitted
two medical exams asserting that his health and age made him a
near-invalid and that continued imprisonment would endanger his life.
Papon has had triple bypass surgery and wears a pacemaker.</TE>
<TE>   The judges also rejected an argument by prosecutors that Papon's
release would pose a threat to public order.</TE>
<TE>   "His condition is severely incompatible with incarceration," the
judges wrote in their verdict, according to French news reports.</TE>
<TE>   Papon did not listen to radio reports of the decision because he
thought the appeal had no chance, according to his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't believe it," lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut told reporters. "I
told him he was free. He said, 'How did it happen?' "</TE>
<TE>   In response to the release, Serge Klarsfeld, a Nazi-hunter and
representative of an association of children of Holocaust victims
here, said: "All of those who are old and sick must now be released
or this will mean that there is a double standard. The justice system
showed today a leniency that contradicts the decision of the jury,
which took into account the possibility that Mr. Papon could die in
prison."</TE>
<TE>   Israel's Foreign Ministry, which during the past year has
expressed concern about anti-Semitism in France, reacted with
disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "A man who committed such grave crimes against the Jewish people
and humanity ought to end his days in jail," Deputy Foreign Minister
Michael Melchior said.</TE>

construction of the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline.</LD>
<LD>   The pipeline from Azerbaijan's Sangachal terminal, 25 miles south
of the capital, Baku, to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan has
been under discussion for eight years. When completed, it is expected
to reduce dependence on Persian Gulf exporters and Russian pipelines.</LD>
<LD>   Abraham, Azerbaijani President Heydar A. Aliyev, Turkish President
Ahmet Necdet Sezer and Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
whose territory the pipeline will cross, participated in Wednesday's
groundbreaking ceremony.</LD>
<TE>   "This project guarantees peace, security and stability in the
region and still further unites three countries and three peoples,"
Aliyev said at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   The 1,091-mile pipeline, which will be operated by BP, will carry
Caspian Basin energy resources--the world's third-largest--to the
Turkish port en route to Western markets.</TE>
<TE>   The pipeline project, to be completed in 2004, has won strong
support from the U.S., which is eager to find a more stable energy
source outside the sway of the Mideast.</TE>

<HD>Protesters Heckle Rumsfeld at Hearing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a rare breach of Capitol Hill decorum, two protesters heckled
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Wednesday during a House
committee hearing on Iraq, unfurling a banner that read "U.N.
Inspection Not War" and chanting the slogan until police escorted
them out.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred at the Rayburn Office Building, across the
street from the Capitol. Members of the public may no longer wander
the halls of Congress unescorted, but they are free to walk through
the neighboring House and Senate office buildings where hearings are
held. Anyone patient enough to wait in line for a seat can enter
after walking through a metal detector.</LD>
<LD>   Early in Rumsfeld's remarks urging Congress to give President Bush
a free hand on Iraq, he asked, "What is the responsible course of
action for our country?" He was about to answer his own question when
one of the protesters did it for him.</LD>
<TE>   "Yes, Mr. Rumsfeld, I think we need weapons inspections, not war,"
she said as at least one audience member cheered. "Why are you
obstructing the inspections? Is this really about oil? How many
civilians will be killed? How many of our servicemen will be killed?"</TE>
<TE>   A second woman yelled, "Isn't this really about oil?"</TE>
<TE>   Committee members, Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, smiled and waited as Capitol Hill police
took away the two women, who were seated behind Rumsfeld, and a third
woman who chanted near the door to the hearing room.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld used the protest to further his point.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Chairman, as I listened to those comments, it struck me what
a wonderful thing free speech is," Rumsfeld said, to chuckles. "But,
of course, people like that are not able to go into Iraq and make
demonstrations like that because they don't have free speech."</TE>
<TE>   The women removed from the hearing--Medea Benjamin, who ran for
U.S. Senate in California on the Green Party ticket in 2000, and
Diane Wilson--were interviewed Wednesday on CNN.</TE>

<HD>In a Breakthrough, Rebels Agree to Accept Autonomy in Sri
Lanka</HD>
<DH>Asia: Tamil Tigers' shift from independence demand comes
after three days of talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SATTAHIP, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels said at the end of a landmark peace
conference Wednesday that they would settle for autonomy rather than
a separate state, the issue at the heart of two decades of war.</LD>
<LD>   The switch in tone by the Tigers came after three days of
Norwegian-sponsored talks here, where the rebels and the government
expressed optimism that the latest discussions would succeed where
four previous peace initiatives ended in bloodshed.</LD>
<LD>   "We are now confident the peace process is going to advance and
succeed," chief rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham told a news
conference Wednesday. But he added that the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam would fight for a separate state "as a last resort" for
minority Tamils if their demands for self-determination and autonomy
were not met.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, the Tigers have been firm in their demands for
self-determination while hedging on giving up their key demand for a
separate homeland, or eelam. Balasingham said the Tigers were pushing
for "substantial autonomy" but that eelam was not the ultimate goal.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels want money to rebuild and the right to run their own
affairs, but they have agreed for the first time to join the
government in redevelopment of the battered north and east of the
island.</TE>
<TE>   "A stable foundation for peace has been established, and a
cease-fire is holding for the last seven months," Balasingham said,
referring to a truce that was signed in February.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the Tigers, who took up arms in 1983 to fight for
independence, would not lay down their weapons until a permanent
peace was reached.</TE>
<TE>   Government negotiator G.L. Peiris said the Tigers' dreams could be
achieved without breaking up the country.</TE>
<TE>   "They have stated it categorically on this occasion: A separate
state is not what their aspirations are about," he said. "Their
aspirations can be fulfilled within one country, if we set about it
in the proper way."</TE>
<TE>   The parties also said they will meet again at the end of October.</TE>
<TE>   The Norwegian government, which is overseeing the talks, said the
agreement by the two sides to work together in a task force for
humanitarian and reconstruction activities was a breakthrough.</TE>
<TE>   A joint operation would have been unthinkable a year ago, with the
Tigers maintaining that they alone had the right to run aid projects
in rebel areas.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Ruling Says Firms Liable for Abuse Abroad</HD>
<DH>Courts: Suit by villagers claims Unocal abetted rights
violations at a project in Myanmar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a setback for multinational corporations, a federal appeals panel
ruled Wednesday that they can be held liable in U.S. courts for
aiding and abetting human rights violations committed by others
abroad.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling, which the panel said was unprecedented, came in a case
that accuses El Segundo-based Unocal Corp. of turning a blind eye to
alleged human rights abuses, including murder and rape, against
Burmese villagers. Myanmar government soldiers allegedly forced the
villagers to work on a $1.2-billion natural gas pipeline.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by a panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
in Pasadena was seen as a breakthrough for foreigners seeking to hold
multinational corporations accountable for their alleged complicity
with repressive regimes in human rights abuses.</LD>
<TE>   At least 10 similar lawsuits are pending around the country
against corporations, including ChevronTexaco Corp. and Coca-Cola
Co., and human rights lawyers have several other cases involving
multinational companies waiting in the wings. With Wednesday's
ruling, they probably will move forward.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Unocal were considering their options for appealing
and were confident the company would prevail.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Benson, a Loyola Law School professor and longtime critic
of Unocal's participation in the Myanmar pipeline, called the ruling
"an enormously big decision."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, lawyers for 13 Burmese villagers pressing their
grievances from a refugee camp in Thailand said the decision was a
huge victory for them and an example for courts in similar lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "Unocal was saying you can't hold us liable because we didn't hold
the gun," said Terry Collingsworth, a lawyer for some of the
plaintiffs. "That's the classic Nuremberg defense: We weren't the
Nazis. We merely profited from them. Now this court has clarified
that you cannot knowingly assist a crime and claim you are not
responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Corporations usually succeed in getting such cases dismissed
before trial, but the Unocal case, thrown out of federal court, was
refiled in state court and is set to go before a Los Angeles jury
Feb. 4.</TE>
<TE>   "What the case is about is whether a private American company can
be held responsible for the actions of a foreign military regime when
the company itself didn't do any of the offending conduct," said
Daniel M. Petrocelli, a lawyer Unocal brought into the case about a
month ago.</TE>
<TE>   A French company ran the pipeline project and Unocal's involvement
was as an investor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "No Unocal person participated in any acts of wrongdoing,"
Petrocelli said. "Unocal does not have, nor ever had, any control
over the actions of the Myanmar military. The company does not
direct, countenance or condone the violation of any person's human
rights, and it certainly did not aid or abet the violation of
anyone's human rights. And if that is the standard that is applied in
this case, we are confident we will meet that standard."</TE>
<TE>   The legal battle began six years ago when Burmese villagers filed
a suit in U.S. federal court demanding that Unocal pay tens of
millions of dollars in damages for alleged abuses committed by
soldiers along the Yadana pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge found that the evidence suggests "that Unocal knew
that forced labor was being utilized and that the joint venturers
benefited from the practice." But he threw out the case because the
company's conduct did not rise to the level of "active
participation"--a liability standard the court borrowed from the
Nuremberg war crimes trials involving the role of German
industrialists in the Nazi forced-labor program.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Burmese villagers responded by filing a new
lawsuit in Superior Court in Los Angeles, making many of the same
charges under state law. That case is set for trial in February. The
lawyers also appealed the federal judge's dismissal, which led to
Wednesday's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Although the appeals panel sent the case back to the lower federal
court for trial, the villagers' lawyers said they would ask Superior
Court Judge Victoria Gerrard Chaney to apply the new liability
standard in the state trial.</TE>
<TE>   The decision was issued by a three-judge panel sitting in Pasadena
for arguments in December. Although the judges agreed that Unocal
should face trial, they disagreed over what standard of liability
should apply. In the majority opinion, Judges Harry Pregerson and A.
Wallace Tashima said Unocal should be held to an international law
standard developed by recent war crimes tribunals in Yugoslavia and
Rwanda.</TE>
<TE>   Given the "sufficient evidence in the present case that Unocal
gave assistance and encouragement to the Myanmar Military ... we may
impose aiding and abetting liability for knowing practical assistance
or encouragement, which has a substantial effect on perpetuation of
the crime," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Those are the circumstances for liability that the plaintiffs had
asked for, said Paul Hoffman, a Los Angeles lawyer representing some
of the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's going to be of enormous significance in the cases pending
across the country," Hoffman said. "People around the world have been
waiting for this decision to come down."</TE>
<TE>   Loyola's Benson said holding companies liable for aiding and
abetting is not a new notion in the United States. "It's very
ordinary, routine American tort law that companies are responsible
for the actions of those they hire to do things for them," he said.
"So it doesn't stretch legal principles at all. But it does make new
law in this particular area of international law, in holding
transnational companies responsible. It makes this a path-breaking
decision."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling may encourage multinational corporations to apply U.S.
workplace standards to operations abroad, said Christine Rosen, an
associate professor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   "It should be a wake-up call to companies that they may be held to
American standards of liability, that it now makes even more sense
for them to apply American standards in labor relations and
environmental affairs and so forth in the developing world."</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese to Cut Programs, Jobs to Close Budget Gap</HD>
<DH>Spending: At least 60 workers will be laid off and eight
programs slashed. The new cathedral is not to blame, cardinal says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, trying to close a
$4.3-million deficit, is laying off scores of workers and closing
headquarters operations that handle antiabortion activities and
outreach ministries to college students, people with disabilities and
gays and lesbians, officials confirmed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   As recently as a month ago, church officials said they could close
the deficit without layoffs.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts come two weeks after the opening of the $189-million
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels in downtown Los Angeles. Critics
of the cathedral have said for years that the cost of the building
would harm other programs in the archdiocese.</LD>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, however, said Wednesday that the
cathedral and the layoffs are not related. The archdiocese is
subsidizing operational costs at the cathedral and may continue to do
so until June, he said. The deficit, however, results from losses in
the stock market, Mahony said. Other officials of the archdiocese
have said in the past that the church also needs to set aside money
to prepare for the potential costs of sexual abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also said he expects many of the jobs done by the
ministries that are closing to be picked up, either by local
congregations or by regional groupings of parishes, known as
deaneries.</TE>
<TE>   Others were less optimistic, saying that church programs as varied
as visits to prison inmates and ecumenical conferences could be
reduced or eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   On many college campuses in the region, the Catholic presence will
all but disappear, said Laurie W. Oester, the director of Campus
Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts will eliminate at least 60 jobs in the archdiocese's
headquarters in the Mid-Wilshire district. The archdiocese, the
nation's largest, serves 5 million Catholics in Los Angeles, Ventura
and Santa Barbara counties. Its overall budget is $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts were precipitated earlier this month, when the finance
council of the archdiocese refused to approve the proposed 2003
budget, which included the $4.3-million deficit. Under canon law, the
finance council's decision cannot be overridden by Mahony, said Tod
Tamberg, the spokesman for the archdiocese. A new budget, balanced by
the staff cuts, is to be presented to the council, Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The austerity measures come at a time when the cost of sexual
abuse cases--and declining contributions in some parts of the
country--has caused other major archdioceses to cut back. Last year,
the New York Archdiocese cut 23 jobs and closed 11 ministry offices.
Earlier this year, the Boston Archdiocese cut 15 jobs and reduced its
$24-million central operating budget by about $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts will cause some programs to be eliminated while
others--including such popular outreach programs as marriage
encounter retreats--have been ordered to heavily cut the number of
workers. In some cases the cuts will be as much as 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Religious Education has also been told to cut
back.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese confirmed that eight headquarters programs are
being shut down: the Office of Ministry With Persons With
Disabilities; the Detention Ministry, which works with those in jail;
Campus Ministry; Ecumenical and Inter-Religious Affairs; Ethnic
Groups Ministry; Ministry With Lesbian and Gay Catholics; the
Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Women; and the Office of Respect
Life, which runs counseling services for women who have had abortions
and advocacy programs that oppose abortion and euthanasia.</TE>
<TE>   There is no plan to restore the cuts, even when the economy
recovers, Mahony said. "I feel very, very saddened for people who are
not going to be on the payroll," Mahony said after a noon Mass at the
cathedral. "We're trying to handle it as gently as we can." But
Mahony said the archdiocese had no choice. "I cannot go into huge
debt," he said.At the campus ministry, the program at UCLA has been
spared, Oester said. But ministries at Cal State campuses in Long
Beach, Northridge and Los Angeles, as well as programs at Cal Poly
Pomona; Caltech; and the University of La Verne will be closed in
mid-October.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very sad, from a campus ministry point of view, that the
students on our campuses, especially our large state campuses, will
no longer have a Catholic presence," Oester said.Those who minister
to gay and lesbian Catholics said Wednesday that they were afraid the
closing of the Ministry With Lesbian and Gay Catholics would send a
disturbing signal to disaffected Catholic gay men and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   A dozen people who visit those in jail, including women and
juveniles, have lost their jobs, one source said.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the Detention Ministry, the program has also provided
pastoral care to families of those in jail and lobbied for changes in
sentencing laws. In some cases, local parishes have already been
involved in visiting prisoners and families.</TE>
<TE>   Not all employees who will lose their jobs have been told yet.
Sixty positions have been eliminated so far, but until supervisors
decide how to cut budgets, the final number of employees affected
will not be known, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have been told generally have been given until
mid-October to clear out their offices. Additional announcements are
planned as supervisors make decisions on where to cut, Tamberg said.
Some workers will receive severance packages. Others are being
offered help in preparing resumes and finding new jobs in local
parishes.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to employees, Msgr. Terrance L. Fleming called the
layoffs a "difficult experience" and "painful to contemplate."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the headquarters staff were summoned to a meeting Sept.
12 and told in general terms to brace themselves for budget cuts.
Several left the meeting in tears. Others were angry, according to
those who were present.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mahony and Fleming said the archdiocese is looking at
restructuring the archdiocese's relationships with local parishes and
deaneries. The purpose, Mahony said, is to call upon all baptized
people to participate in outreach efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "It means that everyone, through their baptism, has a role to play
in the ministry and service of the church in the community," Mahony
said. "It isn't just a matter of giving your $5 each Sunday and let
someone else do it."</TE>

<CX>   Archdiocese cutbacks--A story in Section A on Thursday about budget
cutbacks by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles incorrectly
reported that its Detention Ministry office, which serves inmates in
jails, prisons and juvenile halls, was one of several offices being
eliminated entirely. The Detention Ministry staff is being cut in
half. The story also incorrectly reported the date on which employees
were told of the cutbacks. It was Sept. 10, not Sept. 12.</CX>

<HD>Hahn Sees Profound Problems at LAPD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he nears a decision on a new chief for the Los Angeles Police
Department, Mayor James K. Hahn says the LAPD faces serious
challenges and needs a new leader who can overcome a "resistance to
reform" that goes "very deep in the organization."</LD>
<LD>   In an interview Wednesday, and in conversations with friends and
associates, Hahn makes clear his view of the department as a
seriously troubled institution.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the culture that has been typical of LAPD, that resists
outside influence and resists reform, is very deep in the
organization, and I need a chief who can change that," Hahn said.</LD>
<TE>   "I think this resistance to reform that has characterized the
department over the past 10 years has to go away.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have a chief who will demonstrate very clearly to the
commanders ... down to the officers in patrol cars that reform is not
an impediment to policing but that it is absolutely necessary."</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD, as Hahn and his aides note, is the city department the
mayor knows best, having watched it closely over his two decades in
public office.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the Police Commission expected today to give him a list
of three finalists, aides say the mayor approaches this pivotal
decision with a sense of confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has a complex view of that department that you get
with someone who has 20 years experience," said George Kieffer, an
attorney who has advised the mayor and others. "I would not say he
has a simple view of the LAPD--he views it not only as a reformer but
[as] someone who sees the needs of the rank and file."</TE>
<TE>   As city attorney for 16 years, Hahn saw firsthand the problems in
the department, from bad cops to poor record-keeping. He created a
special unit of attorneys to manage Police Department litigation, and
later, he was closely involved in negotiations with the federal
government over proposed reforms in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   He dealt with the fallout from the Rampart corruption scandal and
then, as mayor, he clashed over changes in the department with
then-chief Bernard C. Parks, whom Hahn ultimately rejected for a
second term.</TE>
<TE>   During these years, Hahn developed a sense of the LAPD as an
agency that saw itself as separate from City Hall, autonomous and
isolated, according to friends and associates of the mayor. This is
the department's fundamental flaw, in his view.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast with past LAPD chiefs, Hahn strongly believes in the
civilian oversight provided by the five-member Police Commission,
appointed by the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Commission President Rick Caruso, as well as other commissioners,
said they were told when they were appointed that the LAPD needed
strong leadership, not stewardship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only new leadership at the chief's position," Caruso
said, "but changing a philosophy of how we do business."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the discussion about the next chief has focused on whether
an LAPD insider or an outsider would be best suited for the job. Some
argue that only someone knowledgeable about the department and the
city can reform the LAPD, while others say only an outsider can bring
a fresh way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   But Hahn has refused to discuss that question, repeatedly saying
that his focus is on finding the best person to reform the
department.</TE>
<TE>   The list of candidates that the Police Commission is preparing for
Hahn includes both insider and outside candidates, according to
sources familiar with the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   In a final flurry of activity Wednesday, the city's headhunter
agency made a round of calls to some of the candidates to ask for
additional background information and photographs. Candidates who
were contacted included LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish, LAPD Cmdrs.
George Gascon and James McDonnell, and former New York City Police
Commissioner William Bratton. Other names widely discussed in City
Hall as top contenders were former Philadelphia Commissioner John
Timoney and LAPD Cmdr. Sharon Papa.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission has been whittling down a list that
currently consists of 13 candidates. Under the city charter, the
commission forwards a list of three finalists to the mayor, who then
picks the chief. If he does not approve of any of the finalists, the
mayor, who appoints the members of the commission, can request
another list.</TE>
<TE>   The decision on the next chief of police is a weighty political
one for Hahn: He faces a secession vote in November brought by
supporters of separate cities in Hollywood and the San Fernando
Valley. And, he faces reelection in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and associates and others who have watched Hahn work with
the department say the politics of the issue are not lost on the
mayor, the son of a beloved former county supervisor who grew up
steeped in the world of local politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Hahn is someone who is aware of the serious problems in
the department and would like his legacy to be positive reform," said
Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor.</TE>
<TE>   As he discussed the reforms he would like to see at the LAPD, Hahn
mentioned community policing, making midlevel officers accountable
for reducing crime in their divisions and precincts, and a leader who
is not afraid to borrow good ideas from other departments, if
necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen what worked and didn't work over 20 years," Hahn said.
"I have some pretty strong opinions myself about how policing can be
effective in a community."</TE>
<TE>   He said he does not intend to be shy about communicating those
ideas to the new chief.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to micromanage the department, but I want to be a
real partner with the police chief," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn also believes the department needs a leader who will work
closely with all the constituencies of the LAPD, including community
groups, the Police Commission and the union. The next chief must
understand that all of these, in the mayor's view, have an important
role in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the failure of the last three chiefs--[Daryl] Gates,
[Willie] Williams and Parks--was their inability to work with all of
these constituencies," Chemerinsky said. "The key is to find someone
who has a vision for the Police Department and who has the personal
skills to work with the constituency groups."</TE>
<TE>   Put another way, advisors, friends and associates say the mayor
wants the LAPD to gain the confidence of the public, particularly in
those communities that feel isolated from the department.</TE>
<TE>   Rabbi Gary Greenebaum, a former police commissioner, said he
believes that Hahn's work on the consent decree with the federal
Justice Department while he was city attorney gave him deeper insight
into the changes needed in the department.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the consent decree process with the federal government
really gave him a depth that he couldn't have had up to that point,"
Greenebaum said. "It was very, very good preparation for him for
becoming the mayor and for dealing with this particular issue."</TE>
<TE>   When he became mayor a year ago, Hahn said his concerns about the
department grew. He saw a department reluctant and slow to move in
the direction he wanted, which was outlined in the federal consent
decree. While Parks created a group to oversee those reforms, Hahn
believed it was mostly grudging acceptance of those mandated changes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Hahn says he sees a younger, more diverse police force. He
wants a leader who can boost morale, recruit new officers and retain
others.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the new chief will find that most of the officers will be
willing partners," Hahn said. "We want to restore the luster to the
badge."</TE>

<HD>A Way of Life May Be Eroding</HD>
<DH>La Grange has been getting virtually free water for 80
years. Now officials seek to change that in a case of old rights
versus modern realities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA GRANGE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Water flows freely in this fading town of retirees, tucked next to
the Tuolumne River and surrounded by yellowed grassland as far as the
eye can see. Most folks are home around the clock, flushing toilets,
washing dishes and watering lawns. Sprinklers sometimes spray for
hours, and one homeowner hoses the street daily in a compulsive
battle with dust.</LD>
<LD>   And why not? The price is certainly right. La Grange residents
have been charged just $1.50 a month for water for nearly 80 years.
That's possibly the lowest rate in the state and, even at that, many
toss their bills in the trash as unjustified.</LD>
<LD>   The water is theirs to waste, they claim, citing historic rights
and an 81-year-old contract. But the era of virtually free,
un-metered water may be coming to an end. Officials who have
delivered the water since 1921 are pushing to install meters and
eventually bill residents according to their use.</LD>
<TE>   The stakes in this tiny Sierra Nevada foothill community (pop.
fewer than 200) may seem small. But the squabble--which has landed in
Stanislaus County Superior Court--reflects the unblinking animosity
toward water regulation in this part of the state, even during
extreme drought.</TE>
<TE>   Water is seen as a God-given right by many in the Central Valley
and Sierra foothills. Key communities--Modesto, Fresno and Sacramento
among them--don't meter residents, so the use of water goes
unchecked. An 82-year-old amendment to Sacramento's City Charter
forbids the gadgets altogether, and residents simply pay a flat fee.</TE>
<TE>   Modesto has installed meters on new residential construction as
required by a decade-old state law, but the devices whirl, unread, as
ornamental as wind chimes.</TE>
<TE>   The aging inhabitants of La Grange say they are fighting to
protect rights forged by their forbearers. But the pressure to change
is mounting as the old rights--and the culture of entitlement passed
down with them--increasingly collide with modern realities of growth,
drought, pollution and strict environmental standards.</TE>
<TE>   Key California water laws have often sprung from tiny
out-of-the-way places, and La Grange's case raises provocative
questions about how airtight age-old water pacts are in the face of
new pressures. As sacrosanct as senior water rights are, since 1928
the state Constitution has required that all water use be "reasonable
and beneficial." No court has yet ruled that a lack of metering is in
itself unreasonable, but legal experts believe a court very well
could. The question of who should pay for the rising costs of water
treatment could also be resolved by La Grange's case, sending ripples
through much larger disputes elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows how these ancient rights can crop up in the 21st century
and lead to big conflagrations," said Brian Gray, a Hastings Law
School water rights expert who is not involved with the case. "There
is a visceral feeling: 'These are our rights, they're the most senior
and that's the end of the case.' And it's not the end of the case."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gold mining made La Grange--placer mining, then hydraulic mining
and finally dredging, which turned the rivers upside down, spewing
massive rock tailings.</TE>
<TE>   The town thrived, fed by its claim to the first water down the
Tuolumne River. Once the county seat, thousands of Italian, French,
Irish and Chinese immigrants crammed its streets. The Turlock and
Modesto irrigation districts, the state's first public water
districts, were born in 1887. They built the La Grange Dam, then
hailed as the world's tallest.</TE>
<TE>   The water ditches and accompanying rights changed hands several
times. But each transfer--including the last in 1921 to the Turlock
and Modesto irrigation districts, for construction of the Don Pedro
Dam--guaranteed "the right of the inhabitants of the town of La
Grange to water for domestic and garden purposes and for the needs of
the town."</TE>
<TE>   The Turlock district would manage the La Grange water system. An
irrigation purveyor and electric utility, it serves no other
residential water customers. La Grange doesn't even fall within its
boundaries, so residents aren't voting constituents. But the marriage
was made.</TE>
<TE>   The great mining dredges' 24-hour squeal fell silent in 1948, and
the town withered. Still, water flowed to La Grange, feeding its worn
cluster of homes, the Fire Department, cemetery, post office, county
park and public restrooms. It is now a shadow of its former self--one
bar, two general stores and the ghosts of history.</TE>
<TE>   "The water is about all this little town really has, plus the
rodeo in the spring," said Grover McCoy, 72, who operated the town
water system for 31 years before retiring in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Turlock Irrigation District officials made only token
efforts to impose controls on La Grange. They enacted the $1.50
charge in 1926.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1983, district officials quietly drew a town boundary,
which locals said unfairly limited growth and cut out properties that
had long received water.</TE>
<TE>   The worst came last year, when the district approved rules to
install meters, force conservation and cut off service for
nonpayment.</TE>
<TE>   A treatment plant built in 1996 to meet tougher state standards
cost $100,000, a sum that would take more than 82 years to
recoup--assuming all 67 La Grange customers paid their monthly $1.50.</TE>
<TE>   District officials acknowledge that the 1921 agreement mandates
free water and delivery to La Grange but reason that rates could and
should be hiked to pay for treatment, unheard of when the deal was
inked, district lawyer Joe Fagundes said.</TE>
<TE>   La Grange residents' profligate water use also strains the limited
system, said district spokesman Tony Walker. Average peak use per
household tops 1,820 gallons a day, well above the state average of
1,200 to 1,400 gallons, Walker said. (That's more than three times
the average daily use of Los Angeles consumers, who pay an average of
$25 a month.)</TE>
<TE>   "We're constantly having to refill [the tanks] because people are
constantly wasting water," Walker said. "I think they're trying to
make a statement."</TE>
<TE>   To residents, who contest the district's figures, the likely rate
hikes amount to a bank charging a mortgage on property it doesn't
own.</TE>
<TE>   "They made the deal and now, 80 years later, they want to renege
on it," said Bob Varain, 55, a rancher and dog groomer. "If they
don't like it, tear down the dam. Without us, they wouldn't be."</TE>
<TE>   The first test of the old water pact may come in the court fight
between the district and Alan Zanker, 39, a mandarin orange farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Zanker's land came with a historic right to irrigation water. But
he has feuded with the district for years over the extent of his
rights to that water and to the town's drinking water. In 1999,
Zanker ran a line from a water box that was inside the district
boundary to a new home outside the line.</TE>
<TE>   On an August night in 2000, as the town water committee met around
Zanker's dining table, he was served with a lawsuit for taking water
unlawfully. Committee members agreed right then that Zanker's fight
was theirs; they would seek the town's support to weigh in on
Zanker's behalf. Last year, a Superior Court judge allowed the town
to formally intervene in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd be setting a precedent, and we couldn't let them do that,"
said McCoy, who is leading the fight against his former employer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Talk of metering and rising water rates is considered sacrilege in
much of the Central Valley and Sierra foothills, where liberal,
mining-era water rights have reigned supreme.</TE>
<TE>   But things are changing. The gap between water supply and demand
in California is projected to total 2.4 million acre-feet during even
the non-drought years by 2020, according to the Water Education
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Ground water levels have dropped, driving up the cost of pumping,
said Dave Scruggs, senior water use analyst with the state Department
of Water Resources.</TE>
<TE>   In places like La Grange, which rely on surface water, stricter
drinking water standards have increased treatment costs. Once deemed
drinkable straight from the ditch, La Grange's water now must undergo
five treatment processes and multiple tests for bacteria to satisfy
state regulators.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people used to getting cheap water are having to wake up
and realize it's a resource we're going to have to start paying for,"
Scruggs said.</TE>
<TE>   Metering is considered a crucial first step to conservation. Even
cities surrounding Sacramento are now taking the plunge, compelled by
contract with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and by the Sacramento
Water Forum Agreement, a pact signed in 2000. The San Juan Water
District recently metered residents in Fair Oaks, Citrus Heights and
Granite Bay. And Folsom city officials approved a similar move.</TE>
<TE>   But opposition can be fierce.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of akin to moonshiners and revenuers," said Ron Stork,
senior policy advocate with Sacramento-based Friends of the River,
which supports metering. "In areas that have historically been
un-metered, it's considered a birthright."</TE>
<TE>   Folsom's proposal has prompted a November ballot initiative that
would amend the City Charter to forbid mandatory metering.</TE>
<TE>   As in La Grange, most of Folsom has benefited from liberal rights
secured before state water regulators began to assert their powers in
1914.</TE>
<TE>   "Old-timers remember the acquisition of the water right and the
promise that there would never be meters in Folsom," said Sara Myers,
a former city councilwoman who is leading the water meter revolt.</TE>
<TE>   But many Californians have come to believe that the old rights
shouldn't trump wise resource management.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a social contract that comes with" water delivery and
treatment, Stork said. "It's essentially the conflict between public
good and private good."</TE>
<TE>   The courts may find in the La Grange case that "a deal is a deal,"
said Gray, the Hastings law professor. "With the benefit of more than
70 years of hindsight, maybe it's a bad deal, but it's the deal you
made."</TE>
<TE>   But the courts must also attend to the "reasonable and beneficial"
standard for water use. A consensus among conservationists, water
regulators and purveyors is growing that the common good might trump
individual rights.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the plight of California: How do you adapt to growth?"
said Gerald Johns, chief of the Department of Water Resources' water
transfers office. "Conserving water and reducing treatment costs is a
benefit to everyone."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today, the history of La Grange's old mining days is laid out in a
dusty two-room museum. The gold dredge celebrated as the world's
largest stands moored in a La Grange field.</TE>
<TE>   But some here have fleeting hopes of a second boom--based in part
on their precious water. Locals see subdivisions creeping ever
closer, catering to Bay Area defectors and commuters. And with a new
University of California campus planned for Merced--about 30 miles
away--things could change fast.</TE>
<TE>   "I could build two more homes on my property," McCoy said. "I
think eventually this town will be something, and I think the [water]
district has seen that coming, full speed ahead."</TE>
<TE>   So, ever since leaving Zanker's house that August night, residents
have been on a mission to protect their water.</TE>
<TE>   McCoy and Varain drove to Nevada to scour for gold-era documents,
and one trip to Sonora yielded a 1917 judgment upholding the town's
senior water right.</TE>
<TE>   When the district began installing meters last year, workers only
managed to complete the post office and three homes before
townspeople summoned the sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them that when they had a paper signed by a judge saying
they had the legal right to do it, they could come back, but until
then, 'Get out,' " said Glenn Varain, 81, Bob's father.</TE>
<TE>   For now, a temporary injunction bars the district from moving
ahead with the metering and other conservation measures. A hearing is
scheduled for Sept. 27 on the topic of the town boundary.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, residents are scrambling to pay fees, $30,000 and
growing, from their Stockton water attorney. Twice, residents have
poured into the Odd Fellows hall to feast--at $6.50 each--on
spaghetti cooked by McCoy's wife, Evelyn. The wives sold their old
flower vases, each containing an iridescent fighter fish.</TE>
<TE>   Believers like Bob Varain still toss aside their puny water bills
and gird for the fight ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's to say that in 10 years there won't be 5,000 people here
again?" Varain said.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at it as a property right. It makes my property more
valuable, and those of us who stuck it out here deserve it."</TE>

<HD>Skid Row Hotels Stack Deck With 'Shuffle'</HD>
<DH>Law: Illegal practice of displacing residents monthly to
deny them tenant status is being challenged.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even in the surreal world of downtown's skid row, where people sleep in
boxes or tents or huddled on the sidewalk, the policy made no sense to
Jerome Wiggins.</LD>
<LD>   Once every 28 days, at the request of hotel management, he and his
girlfriend left their room in the Rosslyn Hotel and searched for
another place to spend the night. The next day they trekked back to
the Rosslyn--the same room, the same hotel--and resumed their lives.</LD>
<LD>   Known as the "28-day shuffle," this ritual is practiced monthly by
scores of people who make their homes in single-room-occupancy
hotels.</LD>
<TE>   In California, a person living in one place for 30 days becomes a
tenant under state law and thus earns certain legal protections, such
as safeguards against unreasonable evictions. Housing advocates say
hotel managers and owners, by ordering residents to re-rent rooms
every 28 days, deny their customers such protections.</TE>
<TE>   The practice, common on skid row, is illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Although some hotel owners and city housing officials say they are
not aware of it, a 12-year-old state law prohibits forcing someone to
move to prevent the person from becoming a tenant.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel owners say the shuffle policy, or some remedy, is needed to
avoid unfairly forcing them to become landlords for the city's poor.
Without implementing such a policy, hotel owners would bear all the
responsibilities of landlords, but without the benefit of credit
checks, rental agreements and deposits.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel owners fear that, like landlords, they would have to take
legal action to evict problem tenants, perhaps costing them
aggravation, legal fees and months of unpaid rent. In other
instances, a tenant who is forced to move is entitled to relocation
fees--another concern of owners.</TE>
<TE>   So like participants in some sad urban dance, hotel residents end
up homeless or searching for housing at least once a month. In the
already frenetic and sometimes dangerous world of downtown Los
Angeles, this monthly uprooting adds one more element of uncertainty
to people's lives.</TE>
<TE>   Wiggins, a 50-year-old former Navy man and recovering drug addict,
had followed the Rosslyn Hotel's rules--until he learned that the
policy violated state law. That discovery eventually meant the end of
the shuffle for Wiggins' family after housing advocates took up his
case. They hope to replicate that victory in similar cases now before
city housing authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people really don't want this," said Wiggins of the
28-day shuffle. "But they don't know how to get out of it. They don't
know what their rights are."</TE>
<TE>   Residential hotels like the Rosslyn were once the haunts of
businessmen, film industry types and tourists, but are like forgotten
film stars: Now only glimpses of their former glory remain. Many of
the aging hotels come with problems: cockroaches, brown water, broken
elevators, $10 fees for anyone visiting a hotel resident.</TE>
<TE>   Most hotels offer the same amenities: a bare room that usually
includes a face bowl, and a bathroom shared by other guests. Wiggins,
his girlfriend, Joy Pearson, and their new baby, Carolyn, live in one
orderly room where life is compressed--a small brown refrigerator
against a wall, a Crock-Pot on a dresser, a pink bassinet next to the
bed. They pay extra for a private bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have adequate space," Wiggins said. "But we try to do
the best we can."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for low-wage workers or people living on general relief,
welfare or Social Security, hotels such as the Rosslyn, on 5th Street
near Main, often offer the only affordable housing downtown. Rooms
typically cost about $105 a week.</TE>
<TE>   The Frontier Hotel has a 28-day policy, because "we don't want
long-term tenants," said owner Rob Frontiera, who plans to convert
the Frontier's 400 rooms into 130 market-rate apartments.</TE>
<TE>   "The city makes it very hard to rent to low-income [people],"
Frontiera said, citing eviction laws and building and safety
standards.</TE>
<TE>   The Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles is suing the hotel
on behalf of a long-term tenant who said he was forced to move.
Frontiera denies the allegation.</TE>
<TE>   For a year and a half, the Los Angeles Community Action
Network has documented the stories of residents of such hotels: people
required to leave their hotel for a few days, to switch rooms, or in
one case, to pay no rent for a day.</TE>
<TE>   "The way they implement this 28-day thing is all over the map,"
said Pete White, executive director of the Community Action Network.
"At the end of the day, it's clearly about exploiting the fact that
you're poor and don't have a voice."</TE>
<TE>   There is an added indignity that cannot be measured: The same
hotels that require residents to move out allow them to leave their
belongings--for a fee.</TE>
<TE>   And as Wiggins learned firsthand, the shuffling makes it difficult
for the residents of skid row to stabilize their lives. Experts
estimate that up to 11,000 people live on skid row, with about 4,000
on the streets and the rest staying in shelters or hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "People think skid row: drugs, thieves, robberies--that breed of
people," Wiggins said. "You have people down here who could be very
productive if only they could surpass the level of living here."</TE>
<TE>   It was while walking these streets that Wiggins read a flier about
the illegality of the shuffle. He contacted the Community Action
Network, which led him to the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.
Next he filed a complaint with the city's Housing Department, alleging
that the Rosslyn Hotel had illegally raised the couple's rent from $105 to
$140 a week and ordered them to move every 28 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to bring my baby into that," Wiggins said. "I'm
trying to create something better for my daughter, for my girlfriend
and for myself."</TE>
<TE>   An investigator with the Housing Department determined that
Wiggins was covered by the city's rent stabilization ordinance, which
controls rents in older buildings and protects tenants from certain
types of evictions.</TE>
<TE>   That finding meant the rent increase was illegal, as was
the forced move, said James Hildebrandt, assistant director of the
Housing Department's Rent Stabilization Division.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of the Rosslyn Hotel declined to discuss the
hotel's policy.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wiggins' action might seem unremarkable, most residents
do not seek help from the city, White said.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at Jerome as the pioneer," White said. "Since he's done
it, now more people feel they can do it as well."</TE>
<TE>   The network has sent 12 "shuffle" cases to the Housing Department,
White said. "We're going to send many more over," he said. "We want
the whole City Council and the city attorney to view this as a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   One odd element of Wiggins' victory is that the Housing Department
based its decision on the city's rent stabilization ordinance, which
says a tenancy is created after 60 days. It did not invoke the 1990
state law that prohibits building owners from forcing tenants out
before 30 days to avoid tenant protections.</TE>
<TE>   But it seems few landlords are aware of the law prohibiting forced
moves. Some city officials are unaware of it. Nor is it clear which
L.A. agency enforces it.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Building and Safety does not monitor guest
occupancy, said Bob Steinbach, a department spokesman. The 28-day
shuffle is most felt in the desperate world of skid row, and some
higher ranking officials with the Housing Department said they had
never heard of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not aware of that practice," said Ken Simmons, an assistant
general manager with the department.Housing advocates plan to raise
the issue today at a summit on the homeless in Los Angeles. Also, the
office of Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) is setting up
meetings with Los Angeles officials to discuss enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "[Hotels] seem to be getting away with [the 28-day
shuffle] without any consequence," said Akili, a special assistant to
Wesson who uses one name.</TE>
<TE>   Although the practice has long existed in Los Angeles, housing
advocates say there is a new urgency to ending the 28-day shuffle
because of plans to redevelop downtown. Typically, tenants displaced
by redevelopment receive help finding new housing. If
single-room-occupancy hotel residents do not gain tenant status, they
might not be eligible for aid.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't get these individuals recognized as tenants," it
could displace thousands, White said.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the Rosslyn Hotel four weeks ago revealed the practice.
"Why do I have to leave the building?" one woman asked the desk
clerk. "There's more than 28 days in a month."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have to give you an explanation," the clerk responded.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have no explanation," the woman said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson watched the exchange with a knowing look. "They don't know
it's illegal," she said of the residents. "They don't tell them."</TE>

<HD>Alleged Clergy Abuse Victims Expected to Accept Settlement</HD>
<DH>Courts: The 86 claimants are to share $10 million from the
Archdiocese of Boston.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Alleged victims of the former priest whose conviction set off a
worldwide clerical sexual abuse scandal are expected today to accept
a $10-million settlement from the Archdiocese of Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents 86 men and women who
say they were victimized by John J. Geoghan, said Wednesday that a
court hearing today will determine whether the sole minor in the
group can join in the agreement.</LD>
<LD>   If, as expected, the court allows the minor's petition, Garabedian
said, his clients and the Catholic Church will exchange releases and
payment the same day.</LD>
<TE>   The deal comes after more than a year of negotiation and the
archdiocese's abrupt withdrawal in May from an original settlement
estimated at $20 million to $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It is time for closure," Garabedian said. "My clients would like
to put this sordidness behind them. They understand that the leaders
of the archdiocese don't care about them or their health and
well-being. They feel it's time to step out of the darkness."</TE>
<TE>   Father Christopher Coyne, a spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese,
said, "We are continuing to work toward the settlement and hope to
get it finished. We are hoping that it will be brought to a timely
conclusion that will be the first of many, hopefully."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed settlement, 50 individuals will divide $9.3
million, Garabedian said. Twenty individuals will divide $540,000,
and 16 parents of alleged victims will divide $160,000, the lawyer
said.</TE>
<TE>   The figure contrasts with a recent award in Northern California of
$7.5 million to two alleged clerical abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   Documents obtained by the Boston Globe when Geoghan was on trial
in an abuse case showed that top church officials here knew for years
of sexual abuse complaints against him. Rather than removing him from
work involving contact with children, the archdiocese routinely
transferred Geoghan to new assignments where he worked with young
people.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of that trial, Geoghan began serving a nine-to 10-year
prison sentence in January for fondling a boy at a community swimming
pool in the 1990s. He is scheduled to be tried next month on child
rape charges.</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian said most of his clients were eager to finalize an
agreement, especially since the church backed out of the first deal,
which had been hailed by Cardinal Bernard Law, the nation's senior
Catholic prelate, as an important step toward healing. The
archdiocese cited financial concerns when it canceled the settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Garabedian described the negotiations leading to today's likely
deal as "very simple, not complicated. But the meetings with my
clients were very intense. Some were more reluctant to settle than
others."</TE>
<TE>   David Clohessy, head of SNAP (Survivors Network of those Abused by
Priests) in St. Louis, lauded the alleged Geoghan victims.</TE>
<TE>   "No amount of money can undo the pain, and frankly, these cases
are never about money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all survivors owe these brave men and women an enormous
debt," he said, "because they were the sparkplugs that ignited a long
overdue national examination of this terrible crime."</TE>

in an area where the endangered silvery minnow lives.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge James Parker said the Fish and Wildlife

<HD>Bitterness Taints a Sweet Victory</HD>
<DH>Pennsylvania: The little town of Hershey fought sale of the
food giant. Jobs were saved, but wounded feelings and a sense of
betrayal linger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HERSHEY, Pa.</DL>
<LD>When word leaked out two months ago that the Hershey Foods Corp. was
for sale, residents here had a collective panic attack. Everyone
prepared for the worst--new owners who would cut jobs, dismantle bits
of the business and kill the soul of a company town that owes its
very presence and prosperity to chocolate.</LD>
<LD>   The town fought back. Lawsuits were filed and protests were held.
Citizen groups were formed and Web sites were started. Placards
declaring: "Derail the Sale" sprung up on the lawns of hundreds of
homes. Edginess turned to anger. And Cathleen Lewis, president of the
local historical society, said of the community-minded man who had
founded the town: "Mr. Hershey must be turning over in his grave."</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, Hershey's despair turned to jubilation as this town
of 12,000 residents--half of whom work for the chocolate company or
one of its entities--awoke to unexpected news: By a 10-7 vote late
Tuesday night, the trust company that controls Hershey Foods had
capitulated to public opinion and two unfavorable court rulings.
Hershey Foods would not be sold.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a day of celebration," said J. Bruce McKinney, an
ex-member of the trust's board and an anti-sale activist. "It shows
what a totally unified community can accomplish. But it's going to
take time and effort on the part of a lot of people, particularly the
board members, to reconstruct what has been fractured."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Vowler, Hershey Trust Co. chairman and chief executive,
said Wednesday that the trustees had not bowed to community pressure,
but decided not to sell because they didn't like the offers they got.
One bid from chewing gum maker the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. was for $12.5
billion and the other--a joint offer from chocolate giants Nestle and
Cadbury--was for $10.5 billion. Hershey Foods had been expected to
receive bids as high as $15 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the sale scuttled and the jobs at Hershey's now secure,
wounded feelings remain--as does a public sense of betrayal
concerning the board's decision to look for buyers. Citizens have
collected 6,000 signatures on a petition calling for the board's
removal. It is an expression of distrust unimaginable in Milton
Hershey's time.</TE>
<TE>   Even 57 years after his death, Hershey often is referred to here
in the present tense. It is as though his ghost walks the last of
America's company towns, keeping watch over the well-being of his
neighbors and the fortunes of his chocolate factory.</TE>
<TE>   Hershey--who never got beyond the fourth grade and had failed as a
candy maker in Philadelphia, Chicago and New York--ruled as a
benevolent dictator here for 40 years after returning to his native
township and, in 1905, opening a confectionery plant in a cornfield
to produce Hershey's milk chocolate bars.</TE>
<TE>   With the wealth from what would become the world's largest
chocolate factory, he paid off churches' mortgages, built--and sold
at cost--attractive, landscaped homes for his workers, set up a
trolley system and a junior college and founded a school for orphaned
boys. He operated the newspaper, the bank, the department store, the
telephone and electric companies, the hotel and the drugstore, as
well as the park and the ballroom where Glenn Miller and Harry James
played in the summers. If it moved or breathed, people used to say,
it belonged to Mr. Hershey.</TE>
<TE>   He commanded such allegiance--he subsidized the town services he
owned and provided steady jobs, even through the Depression--that
when workers of a new union staged a sit-down in 1937 over issues of
seniority, townspeople marched up Chocolate Avenue to Hershey's
mansion to demonstrate against their striking neighbors. "Be loyal to
Mr. Hershey," one sign said . "He was loyal to you."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's face it, this was Utopia. Mr. Hershey took care of this
town," said Robert Feaser, the current business manager of Chocolate
Workers Local 464. Even now, he added, turnover at the plant is only
3% a year. "Everyone was scared to death of what might happen [if the
company were sold]. And no one could understand why they'd sell. It
made no sense.</TE>
<TE>   "You could understand if there had been a couple of bad years or
the stock wasn't growing or the dividends weren't holding up. But in
good times and bad, Hershey's been profitable. We're recession-proof.
When the economy goes down, our business goes up. When the economy
recovers, we grow even more. It's like the goose that lays the golden
egg."</TE>
<TE>   Before he died in 1945, Hershey bequeathed his $60-million fortune
to the Milton Hershey School for orphans. A 17-member board of local
citizens was set up to oversee the trust, which now is $5.8 billion.
The trust owns 31% of the chocolate company's shares and 77% of its
voting shares; 56% of the trust's assets are invested in Hershey
Foods.</TE>
<TE>   The board--most of whose members no longer live in Hershey, and
only five of whom own Hershey stock personally--said it had ordered
Hershey Food executives to explore a sale in March in order to
diversify the trust's holdings. To do otherwise, members said, could
make them susceptible to charges of failing to fulfill their
fiduciary duties. (Hershey Foods controls 32% of the chocolate market
in the United States.)</TE>
<TE>   "There's only one reason for exploring a sale: to diversify and
stabilize existing assets." Rick Kelly, a spokesman for the board,
said last week. "No one and certainly no foundation keeps 56% of
assets in a single company. The fact is, Hershey has to compete in a
global economy. Everyone else is growing bigger. A strategic
acquisition could strengthen Hershey Foods, strengthen the brand and
... benefit the community."</TE>
<TE>   Even Pennsylvania Atty. Gen. Mike Fisher joined the fight against
the board, saying any sale would cause "irreparable harm" to the
company's hometown. In response to his filing, Judge Warren Morgan of
the Dauphin County Orphans Court, which oversees charitable trust
activities, issued a temporary injunction Sept. 4 to block the trust
from selling. Morgan said the trust's board showed "a capriciousness
that is an abuse of their discretion." The trust appealed his
restraining order, but a five-judge Commonwealth Court upheld the
injunction.</TE>
<TE>   In a town where the street lamps resemble Hershey's Kisses and the
spa at the Hershey Hotel offers milk chocolate baths, the imprint of
company largess is everywhere: on the five public golf courses, the
minor-league hockey team, the new library, the country-club-caliber
recreation center, the excellent public schools. The private Milton
Hershey School--whose 1,150 students are financially needy but no
longer have to be orphans to attend--has an endowment larger than
that of Duke University and Dartmouth College combined.</TE>
<TE>   "My concern was that a sale would have changed the character of
Hershey and torn the heart out of our town," said Mike Pronio, who
runs the grocery store that his grandfather, an immigrant from Italy,
opened in 1918. "This is a company town, the last of its kind in
America. People feel fiercely loyal to it. We all work to enhance
Hershey. Visitors come and they say, 'What a beautiful little town
you have.' "</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, things in Hershey seemed to be getting back to
normal. Restaurants gave diners Hershey's Kisses instead of
after-dinner mints, and from the limestone Hershey plant, the
fragrance of chocolate poured into the crisp autumn. Once again, the
sweet smell of success hung over this company town.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Overlooked Terrorism Signs Well Before 9/11</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: A House-Senate panel report says Al Qaeda was
focusing on a domestic attack and the use of planes as weapons as far
back as mid-'90s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The nation's intelligence agencies failed to heed serious warnings
dating back to the mid-1990s that the Al Qaeda terrorist network was
increasingly focused on striking targets in the United States and
using aircraft as weapons, according to a report issued by
congressional investigators Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The document, which represents the first comprehensive look at
intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11, 2001, lists newly
disclosed terrorist plots and other clues that did not point directly
to last year's attacks, but suggest that U.S. spy agencies should
have been looking for just such a plot.</LD>
<LD>   Among the revelations is an intelligence report of a 1998 plot in
which Arab suspects possibly linked to Al Qaeda were to pilot an
explosive-packed plane into the World Trade Center. That same year,
intelligence officials learned that Al Qaeda was trying to establish
an active cell in the United States. And just one month before the
attacks on the trade center and the Pentagon, intelligence agencies
obtained information suggesting Al Qaeda operatives were possibly
plotting to crash an airplane into the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.</LD>
<TE>   The disclosures were released as part of Congress' first public
hearings on intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11. The House and
Senate Intelligence committees are expected to hold a series of
public hearings over the next month before producing a final report
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's document represents preliminary findings that seem to
undercut administration officials' repeated assertions over the last
year that the nature and magnitude of the attacks were all but
inconceivable until they happened.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the report raises serious questions about the extent to
which U.S. spy agencies had mobilized to respond to the emerging Al
Qaeda threat. As recently as 2000, the report says, the CIA's
counterterrorism center had just five analysts focused full-time on
Al Qaeda, and the FBI had just one.</TE>
<TE>   That was despite the fact that in 1998, CIA Director George J.
Tenet had written a memo declaring "war" on Al Qaeda and saying, "I
want no resources or people spared in this effort, either inside CIA
or the [intelligence] community."</TE>
<TE>   Though money and manpower aimed at terrorist targets grew
subsequent to that memo, the report says "there was no massive shift
in budget or reassignment of personnel to counter-terrorism until
after Sept. 11, 2001."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the report says, "relatively few of the FBI agents
interviewed by [investigators] seem to have been aware of Tenet's
declaration."</TE>
<TE>   Many lawmakers said the report points to systemic intelligence
breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "We now know that our inability to detect and prevent the Sept. 11
attacks was an intelligence failure of unprecedented magnitude," said
Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the
Senate Intelligence Committee. "Some people who couldn't seem to
utter the words 'intelligence failure' are now convinced of it."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby appeared to be referring to Tenet, who in testimony before
the committee earlier this year insisted that Sept. 11 was not an
intelligence failure.</TE>
<TE>   The report, the product of an ongoing investigation of the attacks
by congressional intelligence committees, is likely to put new
pressure on the White House to account for intelligence breakdowns
and push for substantial reform. But there were new signs at
Wednesday's hearing that lawmakers and the White House remain at odds
over how much of what the investigation uncovers should be released
to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Members complained Wednesday that they have been blocked by the
White House from disclosing whether any intelligence warnings
mentioned in the report were ever conveyed to Presidents Clinton or
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has refused to allow such disclosures even in
cases in which the underlying information has already been
declassified or publicly reported, said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.),
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the report contains repeated references to
intelligence that was brought to the attention of "senior government
officials," without making clear who the officials were.</TE>
<TE>   Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman, said that the
administration's stance stems from its concern that "the president
should be able to receive candid intelligence assessments and advice
without congressional interference," and that exposing such
communications "could have a chilling effect" on what intelligence
officials share with the president.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Hill, the staff director of the congressional
investigation, stressed during testimony Wednesday that the
investigation has not uncovered a "smoking gun" indicating that any
federal agency or official had information before Sept. 11, 2001,
identifying when, where or how the attacks would be carried out.</TE>
<TE>   But the report, based on reviews of more than 400,000 documents
and interviews with nearly 500 people, lists dozens of pieces of data
that point to at least the possibility of an event like the attacks
of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the findings are sketched out only in general terms
because details remain classified. The report, for instance, doesn't
spell out the exact nature of many of the warnings intelligence
officials were said to have received, or whether they were pursued.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the joint committee's most significant findings have
already been reported, including the so-called Phoenix memo in which
an Arizona FBI agent made a futile effort to urge bureau headquarters
to investigate Arabs in flight schools; the failure to grasp the
implications of the August 2001 arrest of Zacarias Moussaoui, now
believed by authorities to have been the intended 20th hijacker; and
the failure of the CIA to put two of the Sept. 11 hijackers on a
terrorism watch list until they had already entered the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   But the report also contained a number of provocative findings not
previously disclosed. Many center on a series of warnings that Al
Qaeda or other terrorist groups might use airplanes as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1996, the report says, the intelligence community
obtained information regarding a planned suicide attack by
individuals associated with a "key Al Qaeda operative" to fly a plane
from Afghanistan and attack the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The report also says the CIA had been aware of a key Al Qaeda
figure involved in the Sept. 11 plot since 1995, "but did not
recognize his growing importance" and paid scant attention to him.
The figure is not identified in the report but is believed to be
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the plot.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, intelligence officials obtained information that "a group
of unidentified Arabs planned to fly an explosive-laden plane from a
foreign country into the World Trade Center." Intelligence officials
have since found possible links between that group and Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   That same year, intelligence officials got another warning, this
time indicating that "Osama bin Laden's next operation could possibly
involve flying an aircraft loaded with explosives into a U.S. airport
and detonating it."</TE>
<TE>   Two years later, in 2000, a would-be informant walked into the
FBI's Newark, N.J., office saying he had attended a training camp in
Pakistan and that he was supposed to meet others in the United States
to take part in a hijacking plot, the report says. He warned agents
that "there would be pilots among the hijacking team." But although
the informant passed an FBI polygraph test, the FBI "was never able
to verify any aspect of his story," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these and other warnings, the report says, intelligence
officials never seriously studied the possibility that airplanes
could be used as weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, less than a year before the attacks, "the FBI and Federal
Aviation Administration had assessed the prospects of a terrorist
incident targeting domestic civil aviation in the United States as
relatively low."</TE>
<TE>   The report's findings challenge White House officials' repeated
claims that they couldn't have foreseen the nature of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In May, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said at a White
House news conference, "I don't think anybody could have predicted
that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World
Trade Center ... that they would try to use an airplane as a
missile."</TE>
<TE>   The report indicates that intelligence and law enforcement
agencies also underestimated the likelihood that Al Qaeda would
launch an attack on U.S. soil. This was true even though intelligence
showed Al Qaeda was seeking to establish a cell in the United States
in 1998, and that by 2000 Bin Laden was considering targets including
skyscrapers, ports, airports, nuclear plants and the Statue of
Liberty.</TE>
<TE>   These warnings were followed by a spike in intelligence traffic in
the summer of 2001 indicating an Al Qaeda attack of devastating
proportions was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   Between May and July, the National Security Agency--which
eavesdrops on electronic signals around the globe--intercepted at
least 33 communications indicating possible imminent attack. Reports
indicated Bin Laden followers were planning to enter the U.S. via
Canada and other routes, and were plotting operations using high
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of bracing for a domestic strike, Hill said, agencies
were overwhelmingly focused on vulnerabilities overseas. One senior
FBI official interviewed as part of the inquiry told investigators
"he thought there was a high probability--98%--that the attack would
occur overseas."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's hearing also included emotional testimony from spouses
of two victims of the Sept. 11 attacks: Kristen Brietweiser, 31,
whose husband worked in the World Trade Center; and Stephen Push,
whose wife was a passenger on the plane that crashed into the
Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Both called for an independent commission to conduct further
investigations of the intelligence failures surrounding Sept. 11.
Legislation creating such a commission could be considered by the
Senate as early as this week.</TE>

<HD>Spurrier Has the Blank Look on Big Stage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skip Bayless in the San Jose Mercury News: "The Eagles welcomed Steve
Spurrier to the NFL's Monday night stage by turning his Fun 'n' Gun
offense into a funny popgun....</LD>
<LD>   "Heck, 37-7 was almost as bad as making Spurrier, the ex-Florida
coach, wear a hog nose and a dress and sing the Gators' fight song
for the FedEx throng of 84,982....</LD>
<LD>   "Now Spurrier has precious little time to pick up the pieces
before his team [the Washington Redskins] has to fly cross-country
[to play San Francisco on Sunday]. No wonder the point spreads have
soared to 49ers by eight or more."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the first soccer-style kicker in pro
football?</TE>
<TE>   Lost in luxury: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "The Atlanta
Journal and Constitution reported that it took Atlanta Hawk forward
Theo Ratliff and his wife, Kristina, a full hour to find their
missing 4-year-old daughter, who had wandered off and fallen asleep
in a guest bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   "For critics wondering why it took so long to find her: Let's see
how fast you can scour a 15,000-square-foot home."</TE>
<TE>   Scary: Rudy Martzke in USA Today: "Though referee Bob McElwee
didn't have much time to sort out 'pepper spray gate' in the final
minutes of the Eagles-Redskins game, he might have used a less
foreboding description than 'a foreign substance' was sprayed on the
Eagles' side of the field.</TE>
<TE>   " 'If it turned out to be more serious, no one would be
questioning Bob's choice of words,' said Greg Aiello, NFL public
relations vice president. 'We understand in the current environment
people would be sensitive, and we certainly are going to review how
announcements should be made.' "</TE>
<TE>   He needs to hide: The Cleveland Plain Dealer, sizing up Florida's
game at No. 4 Tennessee on Saturday: "Ron Zook needs an unlisted
number after a 41-16 loss to Miami in his second game as Florida's
head coach. He [also] might need the Witness Protection Program after
playing in Knoxville."</TE>
<TE>   Bass reaction: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "A
Houston man was awarded $75,225 for damages and stress of living next
to a ballpark. In a related story, fish in McCovey Cove have filed a
class-action suit against Barry Bonds."</TE>
<TE>   And Tony La Russa: From the Caught on the Fly column in the
Sporting News: "Fly's Top 5 or 'Why's St. Loo still at the table with
the stakes so high? Credit Walt Jocketty for not folding and getting
a new set of Cards: 1. Scott Rolen; 2. Chuck Finley; 3. Rick White;
4. Jeff Fassero; 5. Jamey Wright."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1952, USC opened the season with a
35-7 victory over Washington State at the Coliseum. The Trojans
finished 10-1, defeating Wisconsin, 7-0, in the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Pete Gogolak, who was a rookie with the AFL Buffalo
Bills in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press, on quarterback
Rodney Peete leading the Carolina Panthers to a 31-7 victory over the
Lions: "I thought Rodney Peete retired! I saw him at the Super Bowl
last year and judging by the expanding waistline, I figured, 'Here's
a man who has grown happy with home cooking.' But here he was Sunday,
at age 36, dropping passes over Lion defenders like a kid shooting
marbles."</TE>

<LD>   What: Tom Lasorda's rendition of "Casey at the Bat"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Hollywood Bowl, Saturday, 8:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   You never know what former Dodger manager Tom Lasorda might be up
to next. Last weekend the Hall of Famer delivered an inspirational
speech to the Notre Dame football team before its game against
Michigan, which the Irish won. Delivering inspirational speeches to
college football teams is something Lasorda has done a lot of.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday night he's doing something he has never done. He's
appearing at the Hollywood Bowl as part of a "Strike Up the Bands"
celebration, featuring the American Winds, conducted by Larry Curtis.
Lasorda will narrate the classic ode to baseball, "Casey at the Bat."</TE>
<TE>   The American Winds is comprised of the top brass, winds and
percussion players from the Los Angeles area. Also appearing as a
special guest will be the Main Street Municipal Brass Band from

<HD>Crisis of '62 Calls to Bush</HD>
<DH>He should ponder how JFK handled Cuba emergency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAWRENCE J. KORB</AU>
<BD>Lawrence J. Korb is director of national security
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and was an assistant
secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In October 1962, as the United States was poised to invade Cuba to
remove the medium-range ballistic missiles from that island, Soviet
Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered to remove the Soviet missiles if
the U.S. removed its missiles from Turkey and agreed not to try to
overthrow Fidel Castro by force.</LD>
<LD>   Many members of President John F. Kennedy's national security
team, including the military chiefs and conservatives in Congress,
argued that this was merely a delaying tactic, that the Russians
could not be trusted and that the president should allow the invasion
to go forward and solve the Cuban problem once and for all.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, in his campaign for the White House, Kennedy had said he
was not comfortable with the U.S. having an enemy 90 miles off its
coastline, and, in the spring of 1961, he had allowed the Bay of Pigs
operation to proceed.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy correctly understood that his objective was not the
removal of Castro but the removal of the missiles. While it would
certainly have enhanced U.S. security to remove a Soviet outpost in
our hemisphere, the risks of doing so far outweighed the potential
benefits.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Kennedy was correct. We now know that if the
invasion had gone forward, nuclear-tipped Soviet missiles would have
been launched against the U.S. because the Soviet leadership in
Moscow had delegated the authority to fire the missiles to their
on-scene commander in Cuba. We also know that a nuclear missile
attack on the U.S. would surely have led to a U.S. retaliatory attack
on the Soviet Union, a Soviet response and a nuclear holocaust that
would have devastated the planet. Moreover, Kennedy did not suffer
politically when the concessions he made to the Soviets became
public.</TE>
<TE>   For three decades after the Cuban missile crisis, Castro continued
to cause problems for the U.S. Cuba remained a military outpost in
the Western Hemisphere for Soviet military forces, and Castro himself
aided and abetted communist insurgencies in South and Central
America. But, in the end, with the collapse of the Soviet empire,
Castro became an anachronism.</TE>
<TE>   With Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's offer to allow inspectors
back into Iraq without conditions, President Bush has been placed in
a situation similar to that of Kennedy. The question is whether he
will show the same amount of prudence as Kennedy, or will he allow
the opinions of his advisors or his own previous statements to
dictate his course of action.</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that Bush and many of his key advisors would
like to remove Hussein and that the world would be a better place
without the Iraqi leader. Indeed, Bush has been talking about regime
change in Iraq for the better part of the year. But should his
objective be the removal of Hussein or his weapons? If inspections
can achieve the latter objective, is it worth the risk of what might
happen if an attack is launched against Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   As Brent Scowcroft and others have written, carrying out such an
attack could lead to the use of weapons of mass destruction and an
Armageddon in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing the inspectors to return to Iraq will not be easy for
Bush. His vice president and his secretary of Defense have dismissed
the inspections as useless. His conservative base was not pleased
with his approach to the United Nations. Even a successful
inspections regime would probably leave Hussein in power. But if the
inspections work, the U.S. will achieve its primary objective and,
just as we learned to live with Khrushchev and his successors and
with Castro, we can learn to live with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if Hussein does not cooperate with the inspectors, Bush
will have world support for going after him--something that will
diminish the risks of the situation getting out of hand.</TE>

<HD>Dissent Isn't Deep, It's Just a Hole Dug by an Errant Elite</HD>
<DH>Leftists are wrong: Foes of terror are not brainwashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a New York writer and a senior fellow
at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up
after Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is ridiculing majority opinion the only way to show that you're a
free thinker? Or can you agree with the consensus and still have a
mind of your own?</LD>
<LD>   Take the war on terrorism. If you think we are "quagmiring" in an
unwinnable, endless, metaphorical war that we are waging for the sole
purpose of consolidating and wielding our power, does that make you
an intellectual? Or, by contrast, if you think we are fighting a
winnable, justifiable battle against a certifiable evil, does that
make you a numskull?</LD>
<LD>   Certain segments of the intellectual left, represented most
famously by Susan Sontag and Barbara Kingsolver, seem to think so. To
them, it appears that most Americans (who support American foreign
policy and the war on terrorism) aren't doing much thinking at all,
either because they've been brainwashed, as Sontag puts it, by
"lobotomizing" jingoism or intimidated into silence by the
government's "jihad language."</LD>
<TE>   Kingsolver--who, like Sontag, was upbraided last year for an
article she published in response to the Sept. 11 attacks--has just
published a new collection of essays, titled "Small Wonder," in which
she recycles some of the offending material, including her dismissal
of prevailing patriotism as the censorious threat of a "vigilante"
mob infuriated by "thoughtful hesitation" and "constructive
criticism."</TE>
<TE>   But who, after all, is really being thoughtless here? It's the
left elite's arguments that were ill timed and insensitive. They were
made just days after the catastrophic event, while the wound was
still fresh and families and friends were reeling. Like a slap in the
face on cue, they were made again on the eve of the wrenching
anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   From the comfortable remove of their armchairs, the sages
begrudged us and worse, the victims and survivors, our justified
feelings of national solidarity. What's more, they did so in brazenly
hypocritical and self-refuting terms. Here were some of our nation's
most coddled citizens, taking full advantage of their country's
freedoms to deny the existence of those freedoms (especially of
speech) and to denounce the policies that guarantee them.</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there were the core arguments themselves,
denunciations of terms like "good and evil," "us and them," which
Sontag deems "voided of content." But are those words simplicity or
just clarity? After all, relativistic notions about one man's
terrorist being another man's freedom fighter might sound "balanced,"
but the premise behind them is still woolly. Does Sontag really mean
to suggest, as she seemed to do recently in the New York Times, that
history will recognize no objective difference between the French
Resistance and Al Qaeda? If that's the case, we should give up on
ethics altogether. Good and evil exist and can be meaningfully
distinguished from each other by simple criteria. It's hardly
propaganda to say that people who target innocents are evil. It's
simply true--that is, if you're simple-minded enough to believe in
truth.</TE>
<TE>   As for debate and dissent, the idea that there is none going on in
this country is patently absurd. If the thoughtful minority Sontag
claims to represent is really being denied a fair hearing, then how
does she explain the showcasing of her views?</TE>
<TE>   Being anti-establishment doesn't make you a particularly deep,
cogent or original thinker any more than being traditionalist makes
you a slavish dolt. Moreover, when people take you to task for the
flawed arguments you've expressed arrogantly at the worst possible
time, it doesn't mean they're mindless bigots, and it certainly
doesn't mean that your nation refuses to brook dissent.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, it means that dissent is an ongoing formula.
Assertion invites rebuttal, and in this regard, the patriotic
majority has shown at least as much intellectual creativity--and
moxie--as the loyal opposition.</TE>

<LD>A federal appeals court recently upheld the death penalty for
convicted murderer Stanley "Tookie" Williams, who has been on San
Quentin's death row for 20 years. But in a unique move, the court
suggested that Gov. Gray Davis consider commuting the sentence
because of Williams' "laudable" anti-gang efforts while in prison,
which led to his being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, 48, is a legendary figure in the world of L.A.
gangsters. The 400 gangsters who convened in a hotel ballroom for a
peace meeting in 1993 cheered him when he addressed them through a
videotaped message from San Quentin, condemning violence and urging a
treaty.</LD>
<LD>   Williams has totally changed his attitude about gang violence and
has developed some valuable insights into its insanity.</LD>
<TE>   In interviewing more than 5,000 gangsters over many years, I have
been stymied by this question: Why do young black men, most of whom
come from dysfunctional families living in poverty, constantly
attempt--with too-frequent success--to kill one another?</TE>
<TE>   Williams is the only person I know of--gangster or
criminologist--who has come up with any kind of articulate insight
into black-on-black gang violence. I quoted his answer in my book
"Gangsters":</TE>
<TE>   "I believe the core of it is an embedded sense of self-hate. What
I mean by that is, an individual who has been spoon-fed so many
derogatory images of his race will, after a period of time, start to
believe those images. The images I'm talking about are stereotypes
that depict the majority of blacks as being buffoons, functional
illiterates, violent and promiscuous, welfare recipients, indolent
criminals.... Unfortunately, too many black people have been
brainwashed into believing these stereotypes.... So you end up
lashing out at the individuals [other gang members] that you consider
to be part of those stereotypes. In desperation, you're trying to
obliterate that negative image to rid yourself of this self-hate
monster that subconsciously stalks you."</TE>
<TE>   Based on his apparent rehabilitation and insights into the gang
problem after his years on the streets and then on death row,
Williams has something positive to offer criminology and society. He
would remain in prison and could be a positive force and influence on
young gangsters in the prison community if his sentence was commuted
to life without parole.</TE>
<TE>   There is considerable evidence that lifers like Williams often
adjust peacefully and are a positive influence in their prison
community. They tend to become more contemplative and in many cases
humanistic. In most cases they are a stabilizing force in the prison
community. They usually do not participate in prison gangs but rather
develop their intellectual abilities in their pursuit of knowledge.
They also tend to have remorse for their past criminal behavior, and
many make an effort to positively influence younger convicts who will
be paroled.</TE>
<TE>   If Williams received a life sentence, he would be an ideal
candidate for possible work alongside about 100 other California
prison "lifers" who are now acting as "experience therapists." It
would give him an opportunity to give something back to society.</TE>

<LD>Stroll through parts of downtown Los Angeles, where scores of people
camp in ratty tents or lie passed out drunk in doorways and it's hard
to imagine too many concerns so pressing that a civic leader would
snub the summit on homelessness that Sheriff Lee Baca is hosting
today at the city's Central Library. Yet according to a story by
Carla Rivera and Jocelyn Y. Stewart in Wednesday's Times, only Los
Angeles City Council members Jan Perry and Eric Garcetti and
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke plan to be there.</LD>
<LD>   No doubt the other elected officials have reasons for not showing
up to help brainstorm solutions with the region's social service
activists and business leaders. But underlying the unofficial boycott
is a cynical eagerness to dodge the tangle of problems that has made
parts of Los Angeles look like Calcutta and left the county's most
vulnerable adults to fend for themselves in chaotic urban
encampments.</LD>
<LD>   True leaders abhor the void such responsibility-shirking creates.
Sheriff Baca has had the courage to step in. He also has a reason:
Each year, police and sheriff's deputies arrest thousands of addicted
and mentally ill people--mainly for petty crimes such as trespassing
and shoplifting. These men and women do their time in the Twin Towers
jail and then spill back out to again languish under bridges or in
alleyways.</LD>
<TE>   But this tragic cycle is hardly the sole responsibility of the
Sheriff's Department. And by now the public should be as fed up as
the sheriff seems to be with supervisors and council members who play
hot potato with the problem, tossing it from county to city and back
again.</TE>
<TE>   That Mayor James K. Hahn is scheduled to attend another related
and worthy meeting today--discussing the nation's housing
crisis--only spotlights local government's ineptitude at coordinating
its efforts.</TE>
<TE>   It also points to another glitch: The word "homeless" has been
contorted and politicized to the point that it gets in the way of
attempts to solve the many social problems some would like the term
to encompass.</TE>
<TE>   A New York Times article this week captured the oxymoronic way
some now use the term. The story detailed a debate about "homeless"
people who turn down repeated offers of subsidized apartments and are
then threatened with eviction from the shelters in which they may
have lived for months or years.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles too has its share of poor people living grim lives in
shelters, motels and substandard housing. Addressing the issues that
make it so hard for them to find good housing is critical.</TE>
<TE>   But the first business at Baca's summit should be to ferret out
ways to help the people who sleep on the city's sidewalks and in its
parks--most of whom are mentally ill and addicted. Their relative
helplessness makes them a priority.</TE>
<TE>   So does their effect on the lives of others. Hardest hit are the
people, usually poor, who live and work in the neighborhoods where
street encampments flourish. But the problem is countywide.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's hard to imagine any route to the Central Library an
elected official could take that wouldn't offer glimpses of a man or
woman who calls an alley or freeway underpass home. If only our
so-called leaders had time to make the trip.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the early part of the last century, civic reformers John Randolph
Haynes and Dora Haynes championed nonpartisan local elections,
citizen boards and commissions and other practices--innovative for
their time--that Los Angeles still uses today. They also established
a foundation to carry on the cause of good government. Fittingly, the
76-year-old Haynes Foundation is sponsoring a conference today and
Friday at USC on how best to run this now booming city in a new
century.</LD>
<LD>   Not everyone is happy with the way the Los Angeles of today
works--or doesn't work. This is evident in the San Fernando Valley
and Hollywood secession measures on the Nov. 5 ballot, and in quieter
grumbling from Wilmington to Eagle Rock.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent polls show secession trailing, and we urge voters
to indeed turn down so drastic a "fix" for Los Angeles' problems as
breaking the city apart. But even if secession is properly defeated,
civic leaders and activists must not stop looking for better ways to
do things. After the celebration will come a hangover if Los Angeles
on Nov. 6 is united in name but divided by a lingering sense of
resentment and estrangement.</LD>
<TE>   Voters citywide already have approved key reforms in recent years,
from neighborhood councils to decentralized planning boards. The
Haynes Foundation conference brings in university researchers and
scholars--a rich resource too seldom tapped here--to talk with
community activists and city leaders about how these reforms are
faring. They also will look at boroughs and other ideas for governing
a Los Angeles that has changed dramatically from the city of a
century ago.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of secession has served as an impetus, however negative
and divisive, for reform. The conference aims to keep the reform
movement going even after the November election.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>We have to cut the nation's forests to save them. That seems to be
the Bush administration's rationale for its misnamed Healthy Forests
Initiative, now before the Senate. The measure grants the U.S. Forest
Service and private loggers virtual free rein to saw down trees on 10
million acres--no environmental review needed. It also lets them
bulldoze roads into areas long set aside for possible designation as
wilderness.</LD>
<LD>   All this would be done in the name of fire prevention, ostensibly
spurred by the reaction to sweeping forest fires in the West this
year. But the Bush measure, sponsored by Sen. Larry E. Craig
(R-Idaho), would not improve the health of the forests or protect
against fires. Forestry experts say that, historically, the worst
fires usually burned land that had been logged or cleared.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation's cynical joke is a requirement that the loggers
leave standing at least 10 of the largest trees on any given acre.
Some fire-prone timber stands have as many as 500 large trees per
acre, and even the Forest Service's own standard for one tract in
Colorado was to leave 50 to 75 large trees. Besides, big trees aren't
the big problem. Little trees and dry underbrush are the kindling
that feeds conflagrations.</LD>
<TE>   Such fuel has accumulated over a century of misguided policy that
called for immediate suppression of any blaze. The problem will take
years to correct, no matter how many towering trees the loggers are
allowed to cut. Meanwhile, drought and the sprawl of development into
forested areas are the main causes of the increased devastation from
this year's fires.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring all that, federal officials say they must allow timber
companies to log big trees to raise the money needed to finance
thinning. This too is almost laughable considering that the Forest
Service has a history of losing money on timber sales.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Congress should provide money to do what's really needed.
Historically, natural fires kept forests open and healthy. Federal
officials increasingly are setting fires to clear remote forests,
which is risky in areas adjacent to human habitation. So the forests
need to be thinned. But this can be done without gutting them.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate should defeat the Bush-Craig plan. A proposal by Sen.
Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) offers a more reasonable and effective
approach.</TE>
<TE>   Existing laws let the Forest Service do its job, provided it files
environmental impact reports and stays clear of protected areas. In
fact, President Bush can thin as many trees as he wants right now. He
just can't take a saw to the nation's environmental protections in
the process.</TE>

<HD>Cubans Barred in Visa Crackdown</HD>
<DH>Security: Chucho Valdes and others fall victim to State
Department rules tightened after attack.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The controversy surrounding Cuban musicians and the Latin Grammys
flared again Wednesday as the island's entire contingent was unable
to attend the awards ceremony in Hollywood because the 22 artists and
producers didn't receive U.S. visas.</LD>
<LD>   The Cuban artists, including pianist Chucho Valdes, who won an
award Wednesday for best pop instrumental album, were caught in a
tightening web of security measures imposed on foreign visitors since
last year's terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   The stricter procedures have delayed the issuance of visas, in
particular for artists coming from those nations--including
Cuba--listed by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism, a
designation the Cuban government has rejected.</LD>
<TE>   "It's bad news in general, but it's worse news if you're Cuban,"
says Bill Martinez, a San Francisco attorney who spearheaded the
drive to open the doors to Cuban artists in 1993. "We're back to
square one."</TE>
<TE>   In a flip of protests surrounding last year's Latin Grammys by
anti-Castro groups objecting to the planned participation by Cuban
performers, a small group of demonstrators outside the Kodak Theatre
in Hollywood on Wednesday protested the de facto exclusion of Cuba's
artists from this year's Latin Grammys ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a blow to the rights of the people of this country and
Washington's way of putting a Berlin Wall around Cuba," said Jon
Hillson, a local union activist and organizer of the protest, which
was mostly quiet, with groups of three and four people holding signs
in spots around the Highland Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard area.</TE>
<TE>   Laurence Shoobs, another protester and coordinator of the Los
Angeles Cuban Sister City Project, said, "In the absence of normal
relations between our countries, these cultural exchanges become the
nexus for the people of Cuba and the people of the United States to
become less estranged from each other."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said he fears the uncertainty regarding visas will have a
chilling effect on promoters, who may back away from bringing Cuban
acts to the U.S. Already, he has advised Los Van Van, Cuba's premier
dance band, to forgo plans for a U.S. tour in November. Accordingly,
the San Francisco Jazz Festival announced Wednesday that the band has
canceled its festival appearances, originally set for Nov. 8 and 9.</TE>
<TE>   It now takes at least 12 weeks for a security clearance, but even
then the issuance of visas, which had become routine for Cuban acts,
is not assured, he said. A State Department spokesman confirmed
Wednesday that new security procedures have become especially tight
for artists from seven nations on the U.S. list of terrorist nations.
Besides Valdes, the Cuban nominees this year included the a cappella
group Vocal Sampling and rapper X Alfonso.</TE>
<TE>   "These individuals, unfortunately, had not lined their ducks up in
time," said Charles Barclay, spokesman for the State Department's
Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Although he acknowledges the need for improved security, Martinez
called the new procedures "Kafkaesque" and "nonsensical" when applied
to known performers with "unblemished" records.</TE>
<TE>   "Chucho's been here a million times," the lawyer notes. "Did he
become a terrorist overnight?"</TE>
<TE>   Valdes and other top Cuban stars were in Los Angeles for last
year's ill-fated Latin Grammys show, which was scheduled the day of
the Sept. 11 attacks and was canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Valdes and his stranded Cuban colleagues later participated in a
concert to raise funds for police and fire personnel killed in the
attacks.</TE>

<HD>The New Spanish Conquest</HD>
<DH>Spain's Alejandro Sanz is the big winner, repeating last
year's unheralded showing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spanish singer-songwriter Alejandro Sanz, deprived of the spotlight
for his quadruple win in last year's Latin Grammy Awards when the
ceremony was canceled after the attacks of Sept. 11, emerged a major
winner again Wednesday night with three top awards in the annual
Latin music competition--this time with a national TV audience
watching.</LD>
<LD>   Sanz, an unassuming superstar and family man, was honored for
record, album and song of the year for his "MTV Unplugged," a live,
acoustic performance of his carefully crafted romantic hits.</LD>
<LD>   Sanz's sweep of the major categories, especially with an album of
previously released material, was a clear upset over two other major
artists with multiple nominations for new works in the same key
categories--Cuban-born salsa queen Celia Cruz and Colombian vallenato
star Carlos Vives.</LD>
<TE>   Vives, who led the field with a total of six nominations, won two
Latin Grammys--for best contemporary tropical album and tropical
song, both for his new album, "Dejame Entrar." Veteran Cruz,
considered a sentimental favorite, won for best salsa album for her
album of souped-up salsa, "La Negra Tiene Tumbao."</TE>
<TE>   In a night lacking in both electrifying performances and
star-making moments, Cruz received the most expressive and
affectionate reception from the music industry audience at the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "What a night!" exclaimed actor and co-host Jimmy Smits, following
a performance by Cruz in her typically outlandish outfit and feathery
headgear. "This isn't your grandma's CBS, that's for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Some would say that's precisely the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The 3-year-old Latin Grammy Awards, the first international
spinoff of the original Grammys, have struggled from the start
between the need to appeal to mainstream audiences for the telecast
and the mission to search out and honor Latin music from around the
world, regardless of U.S. commercial strength.</TE>
<TE>   Although Wednesday's show featured so-called crossover superstars
such as Colombian pop singer-songwriter Shakira and salsa heartthrob
Marc Anthony, most of the other performers are still mostly unknown
to the average American TV viewer. That put pressure on the artists
to introduce themselves and make their mark, as Shakira did with her
exotic performance during the first Latin Grammy show in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there were no show-stopping performances during Wednesday's
two-hour telecast. In fact, even Latin audiences may have been
disappointed with the evening's musical performances, which often
seemed slow, strained or simply uninteresting.</TE>
<TE>   Even Shakira, perhaps the hottest contemporary Latin star, chose
to perform a rather sedate, thoughtful song in Spanish instead of her
catchy, hip-swiveling hit "Suerte," which won the Latin Grammy for
best video.</TE>
<TE>   Shakira's English-language album, "Laundry Service," which made
her an international superstar this year, was not eligible for a
Latin Grammy, which honors works that are at least 51% in Spanish or
Portuguese.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural Latin Grammy telecast was described by the Academy
of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, parent of the Latin Recording Academy,
as the first prime-time television show produced primarily in
Spanish. While that's a legitimate landmark, it's also a drawback.</TE>
<TE>   And while music may need no translation, as the cliche goes, the
same cannot be said for acceptance speeches. The opportunity to
communicate the character of the artists at an emotional moment was
largely lost in translation.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me, but I've got to talk to my people in Spanish," Shakira
said before proceeding in Spanish to thank the usual list of family,
associates and friends, as well as her native country.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, on the other hand, who normally exudes charm and humor in
her native language, relied on broken English for her stilted
acceptance speech, simply repeating her thank you over and over.</TE>
<TE>   Producers attempted to bridge the cultural gap by inviting a few
non-Latin stars to present some of the awards. But right at the
show's outset, presenter Justin Timberlake of 'N Sync made the gap
only more obvious by resorting to a long-outdated stereotype in
referring to his female co-presenter, Leah Remini, as "my hot
tamale."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most exciting moment came off-camera during the
pre-telecast presentation of some awards handed out in 40 categories.
Veteran Mexican singer Alejandra Guzman ran on stage and let out a
big yell to accept the award for best female rock album for "Soy."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow! It's great! I'm a believer!" said the always exuberant
singer, still shaking and clutching tightly to her first Grammy. "I
believe in God and I believe in the people that did this for me."</TE>
<TE>   Other notable winners included Mexican mariachi star Vicente
Fernandez for best ranchero album and Miami-based singer-songwriter
Jorge Moreno for best new artist, a category that has quickly emerged
as a bellwether of future stardom.</TE>
<TE>   Hearing his name announced in a category that included Colombian
singer-songwriter Cabas and Peruvian-born singer-songwriter Gian
Marco, artists whom he admires, Moreno said he did not believe he
would be the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I am, I just try to ride the wave, so right now I'm
flying," he said backstage.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes gained instant
international fame after winning the best new artist nod for his
debut album, "Fijate Bien."</TE>
<TE>   Juanes won again this year, this time for "A Dios Le Pido," the
inspirational single that he performed Wednesday in a duet with Nelly
Furtado.</TE>
<TE>   After accepting his award for best rock song, the soft-spoken
singer said he was happy that his fellow countrymen were also honored
Wednesday--Vives for his two awards and producer Kike Santander for
producer of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so happy for Colombia," Juanes said backstage. "It's been
coming for a long time, thanks to Carlos Vives, who has put our music
on the map."</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Paul Rodriguez explained banda music to the TV
audience--"oom-pah music with tequila"--as he presented an award for
the lively Mexican regional style. Backstage he was asked if he
thought the telecast should do more to educate viewers who may not be
familiar with all the genres of Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   "When we watch the white music awards, you don't explain anything
to us," Rodriguez said. "What is country-western? But, seriously,
what I do want people to know is that Latin music is not something
that happened today. It's been here for a long time and accepted
worldwide."</TE>
<TE>   The Latin Academy has almost 4,000 members worldwide, just over
half in the U.S. This year's eligibility period was April 1,
2001-March 31, 2002.</TE>

<LD>A 10-year-old girl died Wednesday after the sport utility vehicle she
was riding in collided with another vehicle and overturned on the
Riverside Freeway in Fullerton.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities were not releasing the girl's name pending
notification of relatives.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Mark Reeves of the California Highway Patrol said the
accident occurred about 7:30 p.m. in the eastbound lanes just east of
the Santa Ana Freeway in Fullerton. The girl was riding in an SUV
driven by her mother, he said, when it collided with a car going the
same direction and overturned.</LD>
<TE>   The girl was pronounced dead at the scene, Reeves said, and her
mother was taken to a hospital for observation. The driver of the
other vehicle was uninjured.</TE>
<TE>   The accident remains under investigation, he said.</TE>

<LD>"Congress Misses the Mark," your Sept. 15 editorial against arming
pilots, confirms what many of us have long suspected: Your staff's
knee-jerk opposition to gun ownership knows no boundaries. Do you
seriously believe that 3,000 people would have died on 9/11 if
American pilots, like their Israeli counterparts, had been armed?</LD>
<LD>   In an era where many Americans--other than felons, wife-beaters,
mental patients and California residents--can obtain licenses to
carry concealed firearms, do you seriously believe that there are any
people out there who can be trusted flying a commercial jetliner yet
cannot be trusted with a firearm? Or is your anti-gun-owner hysteria
so extreme that you would willingly trade 3,000 lives for the luxury
of ideological consistency?</LD>

<TE>   If the pilots on the four 9/11 flights had been armed, 3,000
people would still be alive. If the El Al Airlines ticket counter
guard had not been armed at LAX, many more people would probably be
dead. El Al pilots are armed and they have not been hijacked in
decades. Where at The Times is the recognition of these simple,
empirical truths?</TE>
<TE>   Why would Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein back arming
airline pilots? These two are staunchly anti-gun and have never
folded on this issue from political pressure. They have resolutely
refused to recognize every sensible argument in favor of guns as
tools for self-defense--until now. Why now? Just maybe because they
recognize that the only way to quickly increase security aboard
airliners is to train and arm the pilots.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Attitude Alienates Potential Allies on Iraq</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I could not agree more with "War Issue Imperils Constitution"
(Commentary, Sept. 17). Not only would President Bush's proposed
attack on Iraq violate the Constitution, it would also violate the
United Nations charter--a document that the U.S. helped author and
has signed and ratified, giving it the weight of law. According to
the charter, member nations may not engage unilaterally in military
actions against foreign powers unless they are defending themselves
against a physical attack. If not under attack, member nations are
required to petition the U.N. Security Council, which must first seek
nonviolent solutions before authorizing a military response. The
objective of removing Saddam Hussein from power violates elements of
the charter that require members to respect the sovereignty of all
nations.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's rejection of Iraq's offer to allow unconditional weapons
inspections shows both his arrogance and his preference for violence
as a "solution" to problems, but his failure to cooperate with the
world community will only serve to increase the hostility directed
against the U.S. and to further threaten our security here at home.</LD>
<LD>   David Holland</LD>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bush's consistent and ill-considered bravado, exemplified by his
recent speech saying "the greatest nation on the face of the Earth"
is going after terrorists one by one, only irritates friends and foes
alike ("Al Qaeda Suspect in U.S. Hands," Sept. 17). The U.S. does not
need someone who lacks the finesse to project subtle yet seriously
effective political messages. His brash attitude is doing more harm
than he realizes.</TE>
<TE>   Manuel E. Nunes</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his Sept. 15 political cartoon (Commentary), Michael Ramirez
makes a comparison between Bush and Winston Churchill. If this
comparison is a fair one, let us hope that Bush can emulate the
Churchill who led the United Kingdom through World War II and not the
Churchill who sent thousands of British and Commonwealth troops to
their needless deaths at Gallipoli during World War I.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Men of God, Warriors for Peace, Enemies of War," Commentary,
Sept. 16: Leonard Beerman, James Lawson, Maher Hathout and George
Regas are fraudulent representatives of Judaism, Christianity and
Islam. They give lip service to the sacred texts of their respective
faiths and sound suspiciously like--surprise!--left-wing radicals.
Their peace-at-any-price philosophy is precisely what emboldens
despots and terrorists worldwide. Thankfully, most Americans still
understand that meaningful peace cannot be achieved apart from
justice and that war, unfortunately, is sometimes necessary.</TE>

<LD>"Pollster Prods Christian Conservatives" (Sept. 14), about George
Barna stirring the emotions of conservative Christians with poll
results, suggests that fundamentalists are essentially no different
in their behavior on average than those who do not consider
themselves religious. It may be that faith is invalid insofar as it
affects human behavior. It hints that experience, rather than
ideology, may be what motivates people to live their lives, conscious
of how their actions and thoughts affect themselves and others.</LD>
<LD>   Universal truths are at the source of all religions but manage to
be obscured by metaphors created by those who attempt to encapsulate
and institutionalize the direct experience. Compared with the direct
opening to the divine available to all humans, metaphors are empty.
Socrates suggested, "Know thyself." It's in that knowledge that we
become transformed.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Rizzo</LD>
<TE>   Valencia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The relevance of religion in the modern world decreases in direct
proportion to the increase of scientific knowledge and more
widespread education. Atheism is increasing, up from 8% 10 years ago
to 14% now, and that's only those who will admit it. As the world
becomes better educated, more people realize the absurdity of myths
and religious superstitions relentlessly perpetrated on a brainwashed
population from earliest, trusting childhood in all of the major
religions.</TE>
<TE>   Barna's finding that Christians and atheists live the same kinds
of lives should not be a surprise, as religion and morality have
absolutely no relationship. Anyone who doubts this is just not paying
attention. Current events, as well as the bloody history of
intolerance and immorality of the major religions (Islam,
Christianity and Judaism), should convince any thinking person. I
don't think that, if there is a God, he has ever communicated with
any human being. If he had, he would have set forth the same rules
and regulations for them all and saved mankind all the pain and
suffering we have endured throughout history in the name of this
"loving and benevolent" God.</TE>

<LD>"CEO Pay Needs Some Sanity," your Sept. 16 editorial on the excessive
pay for many of today's CEOs, is timely and on target, except for
your remedy.</LD>
<LD>   You say: "The onus is on corporate boards, which too often have
been rubber stamps, to demand that compensation not exceed
justifiable levels." Those boards "rubber-stamp" because their
members are CEOs of other companies, who vote for hikes in each
other's pay.</LD>
<LD>   The onus is upon us citizens to elect legislators who will ensure
fair regulation of these corporate bandits. And, I assure you, very
few of those legislators will be found in the deregulation-obsessed
Republican Party.</LD>

<TE>   "Storm Brews Over Executive Pay" (Sept. 16) is an excellent
example of distorted and misleading information. I worked for General
Electric for more than 34 years and watched the company grow under
the leadership of Jack Welch. Your article places him in the same
category as the CEOs of Enron, WorldCom and Tyco.</TE>
<TE>   Welch did not run the company for his own benefit. In his 20-year
tenure as GE's CEO, he led the company into becoming the world's most
valuable. His retirement benefits were based on the value he added to
the company and his continued role as a consultant. The benefits he
received have been known for some time and were a "thank you" from a
very appreciative board of directors. I, as a GE retiree, add my
thanks and appreciation for his role in GE's growth.</TE>

<LD>"The Judiciary Committee as Political Killer" (Sept. 17), Douglas
Kmiec's commentary about the Senate Judiciary Committee, bemoans the
"single-issue pressure groups" that, he feels, are impeding the
confirmation of right-wing judges. Kmiec's memory certainly isn't
that of an elephant because it seems to be limited to events since
the 2000 election. Prior to that, right-wing zealots, such as himself
and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), played an eight-year stalling game
with President Clinton's judicial nominees in an effort to make the
federal bench as conservative, pro-corporate, anti-environment and
anti-abortion as possible. Conservatives named the game and now whine
when forced to play by the rules they established.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Creating impossible standards and punishments for not achieving them
brings the obvious manipulation of the interpretation of the "No
Child Left Behind" law ("School Standards Paradox," editorial, Sept.
15). As a retired educator, I think the title of that
impossible-to-satisfy law tells it all. There are so many variables
in a child's life that cannot be legislated that it becomes a
ridiculous joke to impose a standard that includes everyone.</LD>
<LD>   Children are not widgets. They and their schools cannot be forced
into a one-size-fits-all conformity. Your claim that educators must
"stop using student poverty and other social ills as an excuse"
continues the misguided notion that somehow the schools can overcome
overwhelming odds if they just get the right textbooks and tests, and
if teachers would only do their jobs. Let's focus on and promote
realistic goals that reflect regional, social and economic
differences. The flap about dress codes on the same page (letters)
illustrates how far from center stage the true issues in education
are.</LD>

<LD>Re "Italy's Aging Bambini," Sept. 14: I am 33 years old and I still
live with my mother (Dad passed away recently), and no one in our
family or our community thinks it is unsuitable. What should I do?
Leave her alone at her age? Pay the rent for a house where I could
live only in the evening? I do not believe that Americans can teach
Italians how to live; our lifestyles are so different, and I believe
that, in spite of your economic superiority, we live much better than
you do. You cannot apply your mentality to others.</LD>
<LD>   To give you an example, I and many Italians find simply ridiculous
your being scandalized by your former President Clinton's love affair
with Monica Lewinsky. It is absolutely normal for a politician to
have a lover. Who cares?</LD>
<LD>   I do not want the Americans to change their minds, just to make
them aware of our different points of view about many issues,
starting with eating at McDonald's and ending with living with our
parents.</LD>

<HD>BLM Wheels Out Mountain Bike Plan</HD>
<DH>Trails: Using California as a model, the bureau proposes
new guidelines for use of public land, as interest in the sport
increases across the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drawing heavily on its experience in California, the U.S. Bureau of
Land Management has prepared a broad set of guidelines for mountain
biking to help agency officials manage the burgeoning sport on the
BLM's 263 million acres of public land.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is the first of its kind since 1992 and acknowledges the
national popularity of mountain biking on public land, where
officials say more than 13 million enthusiasts ride every year.</LD>
<LD>   "In 1992, mountain biking was not a big use of public lands, but
that has changed and we needed to address it," said Tim Smith, the
bureau's recreation program manager in Sacramento, who helped draw up
the proposed plan. "The important thing was to say that mountain
biking is an appropriate use of public lands."</LD>
<TE>   As a growing number of outdoor activities compete for space on
public land, the bureau is trying to segregate users where
appropriate and mark trails for specific uses.</TE>
<TE>   In California, where mountain biking was invented, bikers hail the
development as affirmation that the sport has earned a place on
public trails.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past 10 years, it's been very clear that recreational
cyclists have been a rapidly growing number of users on public
trails," said Daniel Greenstadt, a director of the San Diego Mountain
Bike Assn. "My fundamental view of what's happening is that the BLM
is catching up with the state of the art with recreational trails
management."</TE>
<TE>   There are nearly 14 million acres of bureau land in the state. The
plan sets out general guidelines--such as how and where to designate
trails for mountain bike use--for regional land managers and will be
followed later by specific rules and regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Among the plan's strategies are to determine where trails may be
shared by hikers, bikers and equestrians and where bike-only trails
should be required. The issue of trail sharing is most important in
areas where trailheads are close to communities and some narrow
trails teem with a broad range of people and animals.</TE>
<TE>   "Mixed trails work in general, but on a crowded trail where you
have hikers, horseback riders and mountain bikers, on a Saturday
afternoon when the weather is nice ... I'm not sure it's a nice
experience for anyone," said Tim Blumenthal, executive director of
the International Mountain Bicycling Assn., which supports the
bureau's plan. "At a certain point, you need to get resourceful and
consider other options. But we have confidence in the BLM. It
understands mountain biking."</TE>
<TE>   The plan emphasizes the need for local groups to help maintain and
monitor trails and to ensure that bikers and others stay on
established trails and roads. Such partnering is common around the
country, and needed, many say, given the BLM's limited staff for
overseeing millions of acres.</TE>
<TE>   "Realistically, self-policing is how this is going to happen,"
Blumenthal said. His group operates the National Mountain Bike
Patrol, which sends volunteers out on public land to assist bikers
and others.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have these groups working with us," said Smith, of the
bureau. "Without the local input, the managers won't really be fully
informed."</TE>
<TE>   The mountain bike plan is the second of three major policy
initiatives that address recreation and transportation on BLM land.
The first dealt with off-road vehicles and was finalized in January
2001. The final recreational plan will deal with hikers and
equestrians.</TE>
<TE>   The public comment period for the plan ends Sept. 25.</TE>

<LD>   The board unanimously passed a motion that asks the film agency's
executive committee to order a "comprehensive financial audit" and
review of the agency's bylaws and policies.</LD>
<LD>   The agency has come under investigation for possible misuse of
public funds. Its officials have insisted that the agency is a
private corporation, although it derives its budget by keeping a
portion of fees paid to the city and county.</LD>

<HD>Burbank Issues Permits Allowing Airport Expansion</HD>
<DH>Construction: Some work can resume on the
40,000-square-foot addition needed to provide security measures
required by the federal government.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Burbank issued building permits Wednesday to allow
Burbank Airport to resume some--but not all--security-related
construction work at its terminal, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The permits allow the airport to begin construction of a new
building shell, which is part of the 40,000-square-foot expansion
that airport officials say they need to accommodate beefed-up baggage
checks and passenger screening mandated by the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   The city halted the airport's construction work last month by
red-tagging a site where crews had just begun some demolition,
because the airport did not have building permits for the project.</LD>
<TE>   Officials with the Burbank-Pasadena-Glendale Airport Authority
said they couldn't wait to obtain permits, a process that can take
months, because they were racing to meet an end-of-the-year deadline
for finishing the expansion project.</TE>
<TE>   The project will allow the airport to install better
baggage-screening technology, increase the number of passenger check
stations and provide more office space for security personnel and
police.</TE>
<TE>   Building permits for any improvements inside the terminal,
however, are still pending and can be issued only if the construction
work is "directly and substantially related" to the airport's
security needs, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect we'll see [construction] activity by the end of the
week," said airport spokesman Victor Gill. "The contractors will have
to mobilize to get their people and supplies in place."</TE>
<TE>   Gill said that even if construction resumes right away, the
airport will not be able to meet a federally mandated year-end
deadline for having the security measures in place, because the work
is starting too late.</TE>
<TE>   When Burbank officials halted work on the terminal, critics
accused them of choosing parochial interests over mandated security
upgrades because of the city's long-running opposition to airport
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   But Charles Lombardo, the vice president of the airport authority
and one of three representatives from Burbank on the panel, said the
city had no choice but to delay the permit process until a judge
could rule on the validity of Measure A, a voter-passed initiative
that severely restricted any airport expansion. On Aug. 23, a Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled that Measure A was
unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   "The city was put in a bad position. They had to obey the existing
law until the court ruled," Lombardo said. "That wasn't being
obstructionist, it was being mindful of the will of Burbank
residents."</TE>
<TE>   The city gave its approval after its planning and engineering
consultants examined the project plans and concluded that the
project, which would expand the airport's 173,000-square-foot main
terminal to 213,000 square feet, was needed for security.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very disappointed that Burbank is being seen as
obstructionist," said Burbank Mayor David Laurell. "In fact, we've
gone out of our way to expedite this project."</TE>
<TE>   The city was the one that challenged the voter initiative in
court, Laurell said. He added that city officials expedited their
review of the airport's application.</TE>
<TE>   The city's normal process for review of a project such as this can
take five months, officials said. But Burbank shortened that period
to a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   As for the pending permits, Lombardo said some of the airport
plans for interior improvements still need to be finalized. "When
they are, they will be submitted to the city for ratification," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Refreshing Gubernatorial Debate Is a Break From Usual Hot
Air</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a dreary election season of endless low-lights, this was a rare
highlight.</LD>
<LD>   Not a ponderous photo-op with political props--a prop like some
local sheriff on the make. Not an attack-ad head-chop.</LD>
<LD>   This was a friendly discussion of issues in front of real people.
Not a Pavlovian cheering section.</LD>
<TE>   Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. and Green Party
candidate Peter M. Camejo squared off in a 90-minute debate Tuesday
at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. The event was co-sponsored by New
California Media, a group of ethnic media organizations, and the
Greenlining Institute, a coalition of minority groups that promotes
urban economic development.</TE>
<TE>   It was a relatively small audience--roughly 100 people--with maybe
only five TV news crews.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike most campaign events these days, it's safe to say
nobody walked away feeling they needed a shower.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't everything you'd want, of course. Gov. Gray Davis wasn't
there.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic governor wasn't about to draw more TV
cameras--perhaps even live coverage--to help publicize either Simon
or Camejo.</TE>
<TE>   The Green candidate has been polling less than 5% in public
opinion surveys, but most every vote he gets is one that ordinarily
would go to Davis. That is, if Davis weren't considered a traitor and
a scoundrel by so many liberals.</TE>
<TE>   Davis learned a lesson about debating third-party candidates from
the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial race. Davis' personal instructor was
Paul Maslin, his pollster, who in 1998 also was an advisor to
Minnesota Atty. Gen. Hubert Humphrey III. Humphrey was the
front-runner for governor until he allowed Reform Party candidate
Jesse Ventura into the campaign debates.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely a mistake," Maslin recalls.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo is no Ventura. He's not well known. He's a leftist former
Berkeley radical, born in New York to rich parents from Venezuela,
who runs a "socially responsible" Bay Area investment firm.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Ventura, Camejo is not a showman. But his passion on issues
may appeal to people impatient with mealy-mouthed major party
politicians.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bill of Rights is being shredded in Washington," Camejo said
when asked about the Bush administration's anti-terrorist actions.
"There's madness going on.... All this nervousness and overreaction
and denying democratic rights."</TE>
<TE>   On capital punishment: "It's implemented in a racist manner....
We're the only advanced industrial nation left in the world with the
death penalty.... We need a moral understanding that it is not the
role of the state to kill."</TE>
<TE>   Abortion: "The basic premise of our nation is separation of church
and state. Everyone has the right to their belief. And they can
practice it any way they want. But women have a right to their own
religious views in deciding what to do with their bodies. And the
government must stay out."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Simon was Simon: low-key and cautious.</TE>
<TE>   That's understandable with a land-mine issue like abortion, when
most voters disagree with him. "I'm pro-life, except in desperate
situations like rape, incest and when the life of the mother is
threatened," Simon said carefully. "But I understand the law
[legalizing abortion]. I will uphold the law."</TE>
<TE>   But the restrained rhetoric is a mystery on an issue like capital
punishment, which most voters support and is GOP dogma. "I'm
comfortable with the law as it presently stands," Simon said. "The
governor does have the power of clemency."</TE>
<TE>   I kept waiting for this former federal prosecutor to say something
impassioned about, say, justice for the victims of murdering
pedophiles.</TE>
<TE>   But both Simon and Camejo were debate winners. They got positive
attention. These were little wins, but Simon will welcome any kind of
a triumph after his disastrous summer.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was a loser, but not because he boycotted the debate. It was
because of a gratuitous statement his campaign released immediately
afterward. By agreeing to debate Green candidate Camejo, the Davis
camp asserted, "Simon has finally relegated California's Republican
Party to minor party status."</TE>
<TE>   That smacked of arrogance and elitism. The GOP may be headed
toward oblivion, but it's not because the party's gubernatorial
nominee discussed issues with a Green candidate before two minority
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Davis bashing was held to a minimum during the
debate. Camejo: "He put up a for sale sign on Sacramento." Simon:
"I'll tear down the tollbooth to the governor's office."</TE>
<TE>   Primarily, this was an old-fashioned exchange of ideas on maybe 20
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The event was refreshing. Unlike most, it lacked a familiar
repelling stench that turns away voters.</TE>

<HD>Board Says It Acted Properly in Westin Case</HD>
<DH>Suit: Citing several legal opinions, college trustees
conclude that awarding raise didn't violate law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District did not
violate the state's open-meetings law when it approved a $203,000
contract in May for Chancellor Philip Westin, the board president
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After seeking legal opinions from three lawyers and Ventura County
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, the five-member board concluded it
properly notified the public about plans to award a $30,000-a-year
raise to Westin, who has come under fire for excessive spending.</LD>
<LD>   The board was responding to allegations in a lawsuit filed on
behalf of taxpayers, contending widespread abuse of public money by
district officials and trustees, as well as violations of the Brown
Act, the state's open-meetings law.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, filed in Ventura County Superior Court in July, alleges
the board did not state on its May 28 meeting agenda that it was
considering granting the raise, as required under the Brown Act. The
suit also contends the board violated the law by discussing the raise
behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   If true, then it could be argued that Westin's contract was
approved illegally and should be rescinded.</TE>
<TE>   The chancellor was placed on paid administrative leave in July
while the board investigates his spending, which amounted to $119,000
over four years.</TE>
<TE>   The district's legal counsel, Jack Lipton, and two attorneys with
the Los Angeles law firm Liebert Cassidy Whitmore, determined the
board had done nothing wrong, board President Norman Nagel said.</TE>
<TE>   "All of their opinions said we were not in violation. If there was
any kind of doubt that we were, we remedied it by voting on it in
open session," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The board also directed acting Chancellor Jim Walker to check with
Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   Although Walker never asked in his Sept. 5 letter to Bradbury
whether the district attorney's office was investigating the college
district, Bradbury wrote on Sept. 16: "Without confirming whether we
are currently investigating or will be investigating any of the
Board's actions of May 28, 2002, or any related actions, I can say
that we will not be issuing any opinions or statements on this
matter....</TE>
<TE>   "If the board has the slightest doubt as to whether its actions on
May 28 complied with the requirements of the Brown Act," he wrote, "I
would urge you to [put] the challenged actions [on the agenda] again
for full public consideration at an upcoming meeting under the 'cure
and correct' provisions of the Act."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the board's denial of wrongdoing, the lawsuit against the
district will move forward, said Paul Stevens, an attorney for the
Quisenberry Law Firm in Los Angeles, which filed the document with
Benton, Orr, Duval &amp; Buckingham of Ventura. County residents Gerald
Leavitt and Gerard Kapuscik are named as lead plaintiffs in the
class-action suit.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said the suit amounts to nothing more than harassment by the
Ventura firm, which also represents four community college district
counselors who say they were unfairly suspended from their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "This firm has another agenda," Nagel said. "You have to look at
the allegations, look at what their agenda is. It's to destroy the
board and Dr. Westin. They're trying to put the things with their
clients in the best possible light and the things with us in a bad
light. That's why they're bringing up these issues, like the Brown
Act."</TE>
<TE>   Auditors working under the direction of Liebert Cassidy Whitmore,
which was hired by the board to investigate the allegations, began
reviewing internal documents this week at district headquarters in
Camarillo. Nagel said he hoped the probe would be completed in "days
or weeks, not months." The firm is also looking into similar spending
improprieties alleged in a report presented to the board in March by
the Camarillo law firm of Wood &amp; Bender.</TE>
<TE>   The spending dispute has surfaced against a backdrop of severe
budget constraints besetting the 36,000-student district. Board
members approved a $292-million budget Tuesday for the 2002-2003
fiscal year that includes a 2.6% cost-of-living raise for all of its
roughly 2,800 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Although there were no layoffs, there were no new hires, either,
to keep up with the district's growing enrollment. Trustee John
Tallman said layoffs could be a strong possibility next year.
Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura community colleges have been asked to
come up with a plan for trimming $500,000 each from their budgets in
the next fiscal year.</TE>

<HD>Accused Santa Ana Trustees Cleared</HD>
<DH>Schools: The Orange County D.A.'s office and a separate
investigator both find no evidence of bribery or conflict of interest
in the awarding of construction money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two separate investigations into allegations that Santa Ana school
trustees played political favorites in awarding millions of dollars
in school construction money have found no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The accusations, contained in an anonymous letter sent to Santa
Ana school officials in March, were forwarded to the Orange County
district attorney's office. Santa Ana Unified School District Supt.
Al Mijares also hired an outside attorney to conduct a separate
probe. Both concluded there was no indication of illegal acts.</LD>
<LD>   "Our investigation did not establish any evidence of bribery nor
conflict of interest," Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Crofoot said
in an Aug. 27 letter to a trustee. "No one interviewed during this
investigation was able to point to any firsthand information that
would indicate criminal wrongdoing on the part of any of the board
members."</LD>
<TE>   Mijares said Wednesday that the outside law firm reached a similar
conclusion, which was presented to the five-member Board of Trustees
in a closed session Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The anonymous letter, by someone claiming to be a district
employee, alleged "blatant corruption" by some trustees, including
the board's president, but was short on details and names.</TE>
<TE>   John Palacio, the current board president, declined to comment in
detail Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The letter has rattled nerves in Orange County's largest and
severely overcrowded school district as it moves toward what is
likely to be a hotly contested board election in November. The pace
of construction in the district is expected to be an issue. Santa Ana
passed Measure C, a $145-million school construction bond, in 1999,
and has applied for an additional $185 million in state funds.</TE>
<TE>   The letter accused "certain board members" of awarding
construction oversight to Del Terra Real Estates Services Inc. based
more on the Los Angeles firm's connection to some trustees rather
than its qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   The letter praised trustee and former board president Nadia Maria
Davis but accused Palacio of issuing orders to staff members without
approval or knowledge of other trustees, among other things. Davis
and Palacio are up for reelection on Nov. 5.</TE>

<HD>Valley Constituents Get Barbecue With a Side of Politics</HD>
<DH>City Council: A few hundred people are on hand as officials
bring a full plate of local issues to Lake View Terrace. Secession
leader says the meeting lacks substance.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meeting in the thick of pro-secession territory, the Los Angeles City
Council on Wednesday night offered residents barbecue and
commendations and voted on several actions affecting their
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   With the sun setting on the Verdugo Mountains and a Holstein cow
grazing outside their makeshift council chamber, the city's elected
officials met in Lake View Terrace, one of the semi-rural areas that
Los Angeles stands to lose if the San Fernando Valley secession
measure is approved by voters Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred people and 13 of 15 council members turned out for
the meeting, hosted by Councilwoman Wendy Greuel.</LD>
<TE>   "I like to show you off to my council colleagues," Greuel told the
crowd in the gym of the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Field Trip</TE>
<TE>   The council normally meets downtown on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Friday mornings. Every few months, they take a field trip to a
member's district.</TE>
<TE>   A sort of backyard picnic preceded the meeting. The barbecue cooks
said they handed out 500 plates.</TE>
<TE>   The council members and their aides wore suits but their
constituents were more casually dressed. At least one appeared to
have arrived on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll come to a meeting here any time," said Joe Lozano, who lives
in Mission Hills and wanted to speak to the council about the
Valley's gang problems. It's too hard to park downtown, Lozano said,
so he never goes to City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Girl and Boy Scouts from Sun Valley led the Pledge of Allegiance
to start the meeting, followed by a poem read by Sunland-Tujunga's
poet laureate.</TE>
<TE>   One of Greuel's constituents had the crowd singing the chorus to
her song about Lake View Terrace, where "if you take the time, you'll
be amazed at what you'll find."</TE>
<TE>   Full Agenda</TE>
<TE>   Mindful that they need to court Valley voters mulling over the
secession question, council members brought an agenda full of items
affecting Greuel's district, including:</TE>
<TE>   * Certificates drawn up by the city's calligraphers for community
leaders, homeowners associations and neighborhood councils.</TE>
<TE>   * "No stopping/tow-away" signs in North Hollywood to discourage
drag-racing.</TE>
<TE>   * The transfer of some city-owned land in Tujunga to the Verdugo
YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   * A study of ways to revitalize an area of Sunland-Tujunga.</TE>
<TE>   * Official approval of a limit on home building along ridgelines
overlooking the northeast Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leader Richard Close described the council's road trip
as full of "show, not substance."</TE>
<TE>   "This is cosmetics, public relations," said Close, who did not
attend the meeting. "When there's real business, they require
everyone to go downtown during the day."</TE>
<TE>   Some Misgivings</TE>
<TE>   In July, the council formalized the practice of periodically
meeting in members' districts. They plan to meet away from City Hall
at least 15 times every two years.</TE>
<TE>   When the council approved its traveling plan, some of the more
senior members complained that off-site meetings in the past often
turned into dog-and-pony shows, where little business got done.</TE>
<TE>   Valley Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who aides said had a personal
conflict, and Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who was meeting
constituents in his Crenshaw area district, did not attend the
session.</TE>

bring a full plate of local issues to 'field trip' meeting in Lake

<LD>Meeting in the thick of pro-secession territory, the Los Angeles City
Council on Wednesday night offered residents barbecue and
commendations and voted on several actions affecting their
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   With the sun setting on the Verdugo Mountains and a Holstein cow
grazing outside their makeshift council chamber, the city's elected
officials met in Lake View Terrace, one of the semi-rural areas that
Los Angeles stands to lose if the San Fernando Valley secession
measure is approved by voters Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Several hundred people and 13 of 15 council members turned out for
the meeting, hosted by Councilwoman Wendy Greuel.</LD>
<TE>   "I like to show you off to my council colleagues," Greuel told the
crowd in the gym of the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Off-Site Gathering</TE>
<TE>   The council normally meets downtown on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Friday mornings. Every few months, they take a field trip to a
member's district.</TE>
<TE>   A sort of backyard picnic preceded the meeting. The barbecue cooks
said they handed out 500 plates.</TE>
<TE>   The council members and their aides wore suits but their
constituents were more casually dressed. At least one appeared to
have arrived on horseback.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll come to a meeting here any time," said Joe Lozano, who lives

<HD>Motorists May Pay Double for Tickets in School Zones</HD>
<DH>Safety: High child injury rates lead to pilot program in
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has signed a measure allowing Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties to double traffic fines in school zones, a decision
celebrated by proponents Wednesday outside a Santa Barbara elementary
school.</LD>
<LD>   The aim of the School Zone Pedestrian Safety Bill, written by
Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson (D-Santa Barbara), is to reduce the
number of children struck by vehicles near schools.</LD>
<LD>   "Both counties have very, very high rates of serious injury and
death of young pedestrians and bicyclists," Jackson said after
speaking at Foothill Elementary School in Santa Barbara. "There is
good reason for this bill."</LD>
<TE>   At least one state traffic study has shown that Ventura County
ranks eighth statewide among all 58 counties in traffic injuries
involving children under 15, Jackson said. Santa Barbara ranks 11th.</TE>
<TE>   As dozens of youngsters entertained themselves on the campus
playground, Jackson talked to a group of parents, educators and
police officials about the bill, which was approved Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The bill creates a six-year voluntary pilot program that will
start in January. The additional revenue generated by the higher
fines will be used by school officials to hire more crossing guards
and create pedestrian safety programs.</TE>
<TE>   Most schools have at least one crossing guard on duty during
school hours but not all schools are legally required to post a
guard, primarily because of low traffic levels and locations.</TE>
<TE>   While the new program is voluntary, Jackson said supervisors in
both counties have said they will adopt the measure. Alameda County
was added to the program to include a Northern California community,
Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   During the program's tenure, California Highway Patrol officials
will gather statistics on the number of fines imposed and the number
of accidents. That information will be used to determine whether the
program should be implemented statewide, Jackson said.</TE>

<HD>Man Found Guilty of Killing Girlfriend's 4-Year-Old Son</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Van Nuys jury took just two hours Wednesday to convict a Pacoima
man of the murder, assault and torture of a 4-year-old struck
hundreds of times as punishment for soiling his pants.</LD>
<LD>   The jury of seven men and five women found Jose Cruz, 25, guilty
of first-degree murder, assault on a child causing death, and
torture.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Barry A. Taylor set
sentencing for Nov. 1. Cruz faces 25 years to life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   During the four-day trial, jurors were told that Cruz was
baby-sitting Richard Mendez, his girlfriend's son, May 24, 2001, at
her North Hollywood apartment, when the beating occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's mother, Yvonne Guangorena, 21, testified that Cruz
called her at work about 1:30 p.m. to tell her that he had hit
Richard because the child had soiled his pants and lied.</TE>
<TE>   She said she left work early and began crying when she saw the
extent of Richard's injuries.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had urged Cruz to take Richard to a hospital, but he
had refused, saying the child was fine. Guangorena said she and Cruz
had been arguing about Richard's injuries for about 40 minutes when
the boy stopped breathing. She called 911, and Cruz fled to avoid
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was already dead when paramedics arrived around 3:30 p.m.
and found his body, clothed only in underwear, on the living room
couch.</TE>
<TE>   Photos of the child's body show that his head, legs and buttocks
were covered with bruises.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, Dr. James Ribe of the Los Angeles County
Coroner's Office testified that Richard could have survived the blows
if someone had sought medical help earlier. The boy was beaten about
11:30 a.m., and Ribe said that his life could have been saved if
Guangorena had called 911 just 10 minutes earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea Thompson told jurors that Cruz had hit
the child repeatedly with a belt, gold-tasseled curtain cords and his
fist. Cruz also bit Richard twice during the beating, which she said
lasted 30 to 60 minutes. "Who can strike a 4-year-old hundreds of
times and not intend to inflict extreme pain?" Thompson said after
court. "This was not a momentary lapse."</TE>
<TE>   But Cruz's attorney, Geoffrey Crowther, argued at trial that his
client had not intended to kill the child. He said the family had
delayed seeking help for fear the boy would be taken from his home by
child welfare workers. After the verdict was read, the boy's extended
family said they were pleased with the outcome. His mother was not
present.</TE>
<TE>   "He deserves everything he gets," said Lorraine Aviles, the
child's maternal grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, jurors said the assault verdict had come
easily but that finding Cruz guilty of torture had required more
debate.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunities for him to make other decisions were endless,"
said one juror, who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   She said Cruz could have fled earlier so the mother could have
obtained medical treatment sooner for the boy and saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   "He had so much time in between to make a decision," the juror
said. "He was not worried about the child's well-being." At trial,
Cruz appeared remorseful, weeping quietly as his girlfriend testified
about her attempt to revive her dying son.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a very, very difficult case, and I respectfully disagree
with the jury's findings on torture," Crowther said after court.</TE>
<TE>   He said his client had offered to plead guilty to assaulting a
child causing death, a charge that he said carries the same prison
term that Cruz could receive as a result of his conviction.</TE>

<HD>James DeSilva, 83; Funded Sculpture Collection at UC San
Diego</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT TIMBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Stuart DeSilva, an arts philanthropist who launched the Stuart
Collection of sculpture at UC San Diego, died of a stroke Sept. 12 at
his home in Rancho Santa Fe. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   A Miami native who owned canneries and a tuna fishing fleet, the
businessman had lived in the San Diego area since 1971.</LD>
<LD>   The Stuart Collection, built around installation art and
environmental sculpture, contains works ranging from conventional
sculptures to a granite picnic table engraved with slogans and trees
wired for sound by such artists as Jenny Holzer, Terry Allen and John
Baldessari.</LD>
<TE>   "He viewed monumental sculpture as the neglected part of the art
world, because there was no place to put it," said Patrick Ledden,
provost of UC San Diego's Muir College, who worked closely on the
collection from its beginnings in 1980. "The thing he did that was so
important is that he did not want the collection to reflect his
taste. He wanted it to be the best work."</TE>
<TE>   Over two decades, DeSilva donated almost $2 million toward the
collection. While he was deeply concerned with the endurance of the
Stuart Collection, it bears only his middle name because he wanted to
deflect attention from himself.</TE>
<TE>   He appointed an internationally distinguished advisory committee,
made up of art historians, museum curators and working artists, to
find the most provocative artists and sculptors, some of them with no
experience in creating public art. DeSilva insisted that the works
respond to the university environment.</TE>
<TE>   "What distinguished him from others who've been benefactors to the
arts is that he did it in the spirit of questioning, of inquiry,"
said Mathieu Gregoire, the Stuart Collection's project coordinator.
"He gave a big chunk of money, with no strings attached. Most of
these folks who give money have certain artists [in mind]; they want
to control the situation."</TE>
<TE>   Baldessari, whose 2001 mixed-media "Read/Write/Think/Dream" was
the most recent piece commissioned, called DeSilva "amazingly
supportive of my project, a kind and humble man." The conceptual
artist originally turned down the project because he had worked very
infrequently in sculpture. DeSilva and the collection's director,
Mary Livingstone Beebe, talked him into it. "This was the first time
I've encountered a patron who had such a vision, who put his money
where his mouth was," Baldessari said.</TE>
<TE>   DeSilva was born in Miami and grew up in Colorado and California,
the son of a salesman father and homemaker mother who had been a
Stanford professor. He was a business major at the University of
Chicago when he developed an interest in classical music and opera.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, he married Marne Francis Kuglis, and soon after began a
stint as a Navy pilot in the Pacific in World War II. Upon returning
from the war, he moved to the Palos Verdes Peninsula and worked at a
Terminal Island cannery owned by his father-in-law, eventually taking
it over on the father-in-law's death. In 1961, the chance to open a
cannery in Puerto Rico drew him to New York, where the parent company
was based.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, DeSilva sold the cannery and, at age 50, studied art
history for a year as a graduate student at Columbia University.
Colleagues said he never lost the enthusiasm those courses sparked,
even decades later. "He would get a backpack and jump on a plane, go
hopscotching across Europe to see art exhibits," Gregoire said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, DeSilva and his wife moved to San Diego, where he started
what became an extraordinarily successful tuna fishing fleet.</TE>
<TE>   He later served on the boards of the Museum of Contemporary Art,
San Diego; the San Diego Symphony; and the San Diego Museum of Art.
He was president of the San Diego tuna fishing and helicopter company
Kenram Corp. when he died. His son, Peter DeSilva, said his father's
involvement with the company had been "winding down for the last 10
years" as he devoted more time and energy to his family and his love
for art.</TE>
<TE>   DeSilva was living in La Jolla when the idea for a sculpture
collection hit him. "He used to walk the UCSD campus early in the
morning, back in the '70s," Gregoire said, "and he just thought that
[a sculpture collection] would be a wonderful thing."</TE>
<TE>   The collection was started by a gift from DeSilva and an agreement
between him and the university to place art on the campus. The
university served as a financial partner with DeSilva for the
collection, helping to raise money and maintain a staff.</TE>
<TE>   The pieces in the Stuart Collection have been anything but the
middlebrow official art that often decorates public spaces: Its
inspirations range from political to conceptual, with artists such as
Kiki Smith, whose sculptures concern the female body, and Bruce
Nauman, whose neon "Vices and Virtues" installation on the sides of
the university's theater department is acclaimed by art cognoscenti.</TE>
<TE>   In a review of a 20th anniversary show last year, The Times'
Christopher Knight wrote, "There is simply nothing comparable,
anywhere in the nation, to this exceptional assembly of commissioned
works."</TE>
<TE>   Other artists represented in the collection are "Light and Space"
movement pioneer Robert Irwin; whimsical photographer William Wegman,
whose contribution is a telescope and stone wall called "La Jolla
Vista View"; and Los Angeles' Alexis Smith, whose stone "Snake Path"
winds across the campus. The first piece in the collection, the
birdlike "Sun God" by Niki de Saint Phalle, has become one of the
campus' defining landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   "His biggest concern was how [the collection] would build over
time," Ledden said. "He hoped that everyone who wanted to know what
was going on in sculpture during this time would have to come here."</TE>
<TE>   DeSilva is survived by his wife, Marne; daughter Dede Grant, and
son Peter DeSilva, both of Rancho Santa Fe; four grandchildren; and
two great-grandchildren. No funeral service is planned.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Upholds El Toro Parkland Rezoning</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge says Orange County voters weren't duped into
believing that the former base would be free of development. Airport
backers mull appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Die-hard El Toro airport supporters were dealt a blow Wednesday when
a judge ruled that Orange County voters had the right to rezone the
closed Marine base from aviation use to parkland.</LD>
<LD>   The decision effectively upholds the heart of Measure W, the
ballot initiative passed in March. Airport backers had contended in a
lawsuit that the initiative violated state law.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition--which includes the Airport Working Group of Orange
County, the Orange County Regional Airport Authority and Citizens for
Jobs and the Economy--argued that the initiative, which killed plans
to build an airport at the base, was a "bait and switch" that falsely
promised voters that El Toro would be preserved as open space. In
reality, the coalition argued, the plan that Irvine unveiled after
the vote calls for housing, shopping, museums, an educational complex
and a transit village.</LD>
<TE>   Pro-airport attorneys further argued that even if voters knew
exactly what they were voting for, state law dictates that the
land-use plan for a closed military base can be changed only by the
Orange County Board of Supervisors and never by referendum.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Philip H. Hickok disagreed,
ruling that voters were not duped into believing that the "Great
Park" would be free of development, and that a ballot initiative can
be used to alter a land-use plan for a closed military base.</TE>
<TE>   "A general [land-use] plan can be amended by initiative," he said.
"This is not inconsistent with or in conflict with the county's
General Plan."</TE>
<TE>   The ruling naturally delighted opponents of an El Toro airport.
"Not even all the king's horses and all the king's men could put the
El Toro airport back together again," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer,
one of the board's two-vote minority opposed to an airport at the
base.</TE>
<TE>   Under Measure W, Irvine will annex the base from the county and
zone more than 80% of it for a park. The Navy will concurrently sell
the base to developers, who will be permitted to build on the
remainder and must preserve the parts zoned as parkland as a
condition of sale.</TE>
<TE>   But even the judge predicted that litigation over El Toro will not
end with his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have emotions that run so deep, there are going to
be hard feelings," Hickok said. "I assume there are going to be
appeals."</TE>
<TE>   Fredric Woocher, an attorney for airport supporters, said he would
consult his clients about filing an appeal. He noted that the Navy's
intention to move ahead with the sale of the base within months puts
pressure on opponents of the park plan to get their case before
appeals judges as soon as possible.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Gets OK to Buy, Improve 91 Toll Lanes</HD>
<DH>Transportation: The bill signed by Davis smooths way for
transit agency to widen the notoriously congested Riverside Freeway.
The tollway's price is $207 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday cleared the way for the Orange County
Transportation Authority to buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes
that run along the middle of the traffic-swamped Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The move is expected to end one of the state's most controversial
experiments in speeding up highway construction by allowing private
firms to build tollways.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Bill 1010, signed late Wednesday by Davis, will allow
OCTA to complete the purchase of the lanes early next year, go into
the toll road business for itself and eliminate a clause that had
given the toll-lane owners the extraordinary power to block
improvements to the congested Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   "This will allow badly needed improvements to Route 91," Davis
said. "The 91 can be an absolute nightmare for commuters who commonly
take a full hour just to travel 10 miles."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA needs the legislation to acquire the Express Lanes for $207.5
million and operate them as a tollway until the turnpike's $135
million in bonds can be paid off.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was struck in April with California Private
Transportation Co., a consortium that owns the lanes. Under the
agreement, OCTA will assume the operation's debts and pay the company
$72.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Without the passage of the Assembly bill, OCTA officials feared
the owners would back out of the deal or ask for more money. Either
might have doomed any major freeway improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The bill "represents a local solution to a local problem," said
the bills' sponsor, Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana). "It shows
that private toll roads are an experiment that is failing."</TE>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes run for 10 miles along the center of the
Riverside Freeway, from northern Anaheim to the Riverside County
line. They opened in December 1995 with two lanes in each direction
and were one of four privately owned tollways the Legislature
approved more than a decade ago. Two of the approved projects are
presumed dead, and a third is only now being planned.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials want to quickly phase out the toll operation and
launch $1.6 billion in improvements to the freeway in Orange and
Riverside counties. Tolls, now among the highest per-mile fees in the
country, also may be lowered.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they can provide some relief out there quickly," said
Leif Grane of Corona, who spends hours a day on the Riverside Freeway
getting to and from work in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill cheered the fact that it eliminates a
protection clause that Caltrans had originally offered the road's
owner. To help the Express Lanes succeed, Caltrans gave California
Private Transportation the power to veto improvements along a 30-mile
stretch of the freeway until 2030.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the restrictions have aggravated congestion on the
Riverside Freeway, which links the fast-growing Inland Empire to
Orange County's ample job market.</TE>
<TE>   On workdays, motorists make at least 250,000 trips on the freeway.
The number of daily trips is projected to swell to at least 400,000
by 2020.</TE>

<HD>Candidate's Suit Challenges City Over Land Deal</HD>
<DH>Development: Council hopeful says that in approving luxury
homes on equestrian center site, Thousand Oaks violated its growth
ordinance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Nov. 5 election only weeks away, Thousand Oaks City Council
candidate Michael Farris is preparing for a legal showdown with the
city over his opposition to a controversial land deal that led to his
ouster from the Planning Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Farris argues in legal papers filed this week that the city abused
its power by approving development of three luxury homes on a
nine-acre site that had been set aside for a private equestrian
center.</LD>
<LD>   The brief was entered as part of a lawsuit filed in April in which
Farris accused the city of violating its growth-control ordinance
requiring voters' approval to change the land use of property
designated for parks, golf courses and open space.</LD>
<TE>   His lawsuit further contends that there was insufficient
environmental analysis of building estate homes on the property and
that allowing such construction would lead to more residential
development at the site, near the Santa Monica Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The city, which contends Farris' suit is based on a
misunderstanding on how the property is zoned, has until next week to
respond to his complaint. The case is scheduled for trial Oct. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Richard Francis, who is representing Farris, said the
City Council cut the public out of the process when it granted the
landowner, Operating Engineers Pension Trust, permission to abandon
its plans last spring to build an equestrian center at Dos Vientos
Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the developer will use a small portion of the nearly
2,300-acre site for upscale housing.</TE>
<TE>   "My interest is not three houses and 8.7 acres," said Francis, an
architect of the county's growth-control laws known as SOAR. "But
SOAR is so vulnerable to city councils ignoring it, that wherever
that happens, I feel it must be challenged."</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for allowing homes on the site, the developer would
give the city $2.5 million toward the cost of building a 20-to
30-acre public equestrian facility on government-owned land south of
Dos Vientos.</TE>
<TE>   In his brief submitted Monday to Ventura County Superior Court,
Farris maintains a 1996 city map specified the site as a parks and
open-space area shortly before a citywide SOAR initiative was
approved to protect such land.</TE>
<TE>   But the city says the property, known as Site I, was misclassified
on early land-use maps.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Mark Sellers said the map in question was improperly
colored and that the council had years earlier approved a specific
plan with Operating Engineers for equestrian uses, which are not
allowed in an open-space zone.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a situation of spending a lot of money on something that
is meritless," Sellers said. "The bottom line is the city staff
cannot change the General Plan."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit argues that once the SOAR growth-control ordinance was
adopted by the council in 1996, it obligated the city to adhere to
the land uses outlined in its General Plan and corresponding maps,
whether correctly marked or not.</TE>
<TE>   Mark C. Allen, a Pasadena lawyer representing Operating Engineers
Pension Trust, said his client believes its right to develop its
property should not be jeopardized over a possible mistake in
land-use maps. "Our main objective is to get the thing resolved so we
can move on," Allen said.</TE>
<TE>   But Farris said city officials had ample opportunity to review the
SOAR petition presented for council approval before it was circulated
and signed by more than 11,000 residents. He said the council also
had time to uncover any errors in the city's planning maps.</TE>
<TE>   "What you can't do is, six years later, come back and say, 'Oops!
That's a mistake,' " said Farris, who was ousted from his post as
chairman of the Planning Commission in February after delaying a vote
on the development deal.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Farris entered the race for one of three seats on the
City Council.</TE>

<HD>Balboa Trees Win Reprieve--a Shade Too Late</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Activists won a court order Wednesday halting Newport Beach's plans
to cut down 25 mature ficus trees along the Balboa Peninsula's
historic Main Street--but only in time to save two of the trees.</LD>
<LD>   The Balboa Arborist Society, which has been battling the city over
the trees, won an injunction from the 4th District Court of Appeal in
Santa Ana about 11 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   By that time, however, workers--who had begun at 7 a.m.--had cut
down 23 of the trees. And one of the remaining two had been shorn of
all its leaves.</LD>
<TE>   Stephen Miles, a lawyer for the arborist society, said Newport
Beach officials were hurrying to get the work done.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were given another 15 to 20 minutes they would've ripped
out all the trees. It was that close. It was a countdown, and I was
getting a play-by-play as I filed the court papers."</TE>
<TE>   The race began two days earlier, when an Orange County judge
removed a temporary injunction that had blocked the city from cutting
down the trees. City officials say the 40-year-old trees stand in the
way of a $2.8-million improvement project.</TE>
<TE>   Ficus tree roots buckle the sidewalks and create hazards, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists, however, have argued that the trees are
historically important and attractive. The city plans to replace the
ficus with young coral gum trees.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new order, the city is prohibited from doing anything to
the remaining two ficus trees and the stumps of the 23 felled trees
until the appellate court completes its review, Miles said.</TE>

<HD>2 May Face Charges After Hunt for Toddler</HD>
<DH>Probe: Girl is found safe. Mother had left her with a
slight acquaintance at Universal CityWalk.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles woman and an acquaintance who agreed to watch the
woman's daughter for a few minutes at Universal CityWalk face
possible criminal charges after police found the toddler unharmed
Wednesday at the acquaintance's home.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's Det. Ron Sabatine said "irresponsible behavior" by the
two women caused at least 20 law enforcement officers to search all
night for the 17-month-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   "It tied up a lot of police resources and time," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Sabatine said he will ask the district attorney to seek child
endangerment charges against Lynette Webb, 19, of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services
is also considering whether to take the child into protective
custody, he said, because Webb left her daughter with someone she
knew only by a first name and delayed notifying authorities of the
girl's disappearance for more than an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ann Hardaway, 20, of South Los Angeles could also face
charges. Sabatine said she failed to contact police when she couldn't
find the girl's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Webb left her daughter, Destiny, with Hardaway to visit a restroom
at the entertainment and shopping venue about 10:50 p.m. Tuesday,
sheriff's deputies said. The two were part of a group of six or so
people who knew each other only by first names.</TE>
<TE>   After five minutes, Hardaway looked for the mother, but could not
find her. The group thought the mother might have gone to the nearby
MTA Red Line station, and Hardaway went there to look for her,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all regulars on the train," Sabatine said. "That's how
they knew each other."</TE>
<TE>   Hardaway could not find Webb, however, and authorities said she
was worried about missing her last train home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was last call, all aboard," Sabatine said. "So she decided to
take the child home and figured she'd just meet up with the mother
the next day at the train station."</TE>
<TE>   Webb came out of the restroom and "everyone was gone," Sabatine
said. It was not clear why Hardaway did not turn the child over to
police, or why Webb did not contact CityWalk security guards until
midnight, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   When Webb reported the child missing, she was able to give
officers only first names and tell them that some in the group had
been cited recently by MTA police for smoking and loitering. Law
enforcement officers checked their records and found the citations.</TE>
<TE>   "So we had some addresses to go on, and we began knocking on their
doors," Sabatine said. The effort continued through the night. No
assumption was made that the child was safe, he said. "We treat it
like a crime until we know for sure it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday morning, Hardaway saw a report on the TV news and called
911. "We were three blocks away when we got the call that the child
was at her house," Sabatine said.</TE>

<HD>Foul Odor Sends 2 to Hospital</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two women were overcome by foul-smelling fumes at Brea City Hall on
Wednesday, which in turn forced the evacuation of about 200 employees
while a hazardous-materials unit swept the building to find the
source of the odor.</LD>
<LD>   The team collected samples into the evening after the women, one
of whom is pregnant, were treated at area hospitals and released.
Authorities said a possible source of the fumes was a leak from the
city's photo lab in the public relations department.</LD>
<LD>   Four other employees were treated at the scene for eye and throat
irritation.</LD>
<TE>   "They complained of a rotten-egg-type odor," said Dave Huffman,
division chief of the Brea Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   Six fire engines and six ambulances were dispatched after a woman
complained about a strange odor about 3:30 p.m. A duty battalion
chief who happened to be at City Hall at the time was escorting that
woman back to her work area to investigate the odor when she
collapsed.</TE>

<HD>Foundation to Give USC $100 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of Southern California announced Wednesday that it
will receive a $100-million gift for its Annenberg School for
Communication, the fourth donation of such size to the university in
the last decade.</LD>
<LD>   The gift from the Annenberg Foundation came at the same time as a
$100-million donation for the University of Pennsylvania's
communications school, which also bears the Annenberg name.</LD>
<LD>   The funding is intended to help ensure that the "important work of
the schools will continue into the next century and beyond,"
foundation President Leonore Annenberg and her daughter Wallis said
in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The donation to USC is "another remarkable show of support for USC
and for the city of Los Angeles from the Annenberg Foundation and
family," USC President Steven B. Sample said. "We're delighted and
very grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Sample said the Annenberg gift will more than triple the existing
endowment of $39 million at the school, which offers graduate and
undergraduate degrees in communication and journalism.</TE>
<TE>   He and other USC officials said it will fund initiatives at the
school including an effort to encourage excellence and innovation in
broadcast news, several new faculty positions and scholarships for
students.</TE>
<TE>   It also will pay for a new center for the study of journalism and
democracy, which will be headed by Jay Harris, former publisher of
the San Jose Mercury News.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the influx, USC officials said, the school will spend its
new funds relatively cautiously, with about $1.5 million to $2
million expected to be spent in the first year.</TE>
<TE>   The USC and Penn gifts do not approach the standards set last year
by Caltech, with a $600-million combined gift from Intel founders
Gordon and Betty Moore and their foundation, or Stanford University's
$400-million donation the same year from the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   But they are noteworthy, given the current climate of economic
uncertainty and recent stock market declines, education experts said,
and</TE>
<TE>   should cheer fund-raisers at colleges nationwide, as many struggle
with booming enrollments, shrinking endowments and dwindling state
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "These are magnificent gifts that will have a tremendous impact on
the institutions receiving them, but also hearten a lot of others,"
said Vance Peterson, president of the Council for Advancement and
Support of Education, which tracks such gifts. "And they're
especially noteworthy in this economy, when multimillion [dollar]
gifts have been fewer and farther between."</TE>
<TE>   The council has predicted that the fiscal year just ended will
show a drop in donations to colleges and universities nationally for
the first time since 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's announcement makes USC and the University of
Pennsylvania the only U.S. higher education institutions ever to have
received four such gifts, according to a list kept by the Chronicle
of Higher Education.</TE>
<TE>   "Guess we'd better get to work to find a fifth," Sample joked.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson and others in higher education applauded Sample for his
ability to raise the profile and reputation of a school once derided
as the "University of Second Choice" and for his talent at persuading
donors to give considerable sums.</TE>
<TE>   The haul from a nine-year fundraising campaign--with an original
goal of $1 billion--is $2.5 billion in cash and pledges. More than
half of those gifts are from non-alumni, university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say he's perhaps the most successful fund-raising
[university] president of all time," Peterson said. "He's looked up
to by other presidents for what seems like a magic touch."</TE>
<TE>   But Sample also may have benefited a bit by inheriting an
institution that had never fully tapped its fund-raising potential,
some said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last decade, USC has really become a major league player
in fund-raising nationally and particularly in Southern California,
and that was not true a decade ago," said Patrick Callan, president
of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education in San
Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Until earlier this year, when Penn received a $100-million gift
from the Philadelphia Health Care Trust, USC--and its president--had
garnered considerable attention for its position alone at the top
with three gifts of such size.</TE>
<TE>   The experts pointed out that the Pennsylvania-based Annenberg
Foundation, established by Walter H. Annenberg, has a long history of
support for the two universities and their communications schools.
Annenberg was U.S. ambassador to Great Britain, editor and publisher
of the Philadelphia Inquirer newspaper and founder of TV Guide.</TE>
<TE>   Before the current gift, the Annenberg family and foundation had
given USC donations totaling $188 million, university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The largest of those, a $120-million gift in 1993, helped create
the Annenberg Center, a multidisciplinary program that explores the
ways that communications technology affect education, law, science
and other areas. Other gifts have funded faculty chairs.</TE>

<DH>Education: Primatologist Jane Goodall, in the area for a
fund-raiser, tells Laguna Niguel pupils about her research and
stresses conservation.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spinning tales of the exploits of David Greybeard, Spindle and Little
Mel, chimpanzee researcher Jane Goodall captivated an auditorium full
of Laguna Niguel children Wednesday, slipping in a subtle lesson on
conservation.</LD>
<LD>   The grade-schoolers at St. Anne School pondered the danger that
Goodall said a "gluttonous" world poses to a species whose social
interactions so closely mirror our own.</LD>
<LD>   "All over the world animals are disappearing," said Goodall, 68,
who was in Orange County for a benefit to raise money for cougar
preservation.</LD>
<TE>   Goodall trained a gentle gaze on the kindergartners sprawled on
the floor. "When you small people grow up, the world will be
different," she said. "You can break through and make this a better
place."</TE>
<TE>   Fifth-grader McKenzie Tremblay, her blue plaid jumper a far cry
from the khaki shorts and safari hat costume that she wore to look
like Goodall for a class presentation two years ago, introduced her
idol to the 600 kindergartners through eighth-graders.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year-old from San Juan Capistrano said afterward that
Goodall was "much kinder and less serious" than most adults she knows
and that she envies her job.</TE>
<TE>   "Not many people get to grow up and play with chimpanzees in
Africa," said McKenzie. She said she believes in Goodall's message of
preservation.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why people would do anything that would give us less
chances to find out about animals that are so wonderful and so smart
and maybe can do math," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Goodall started studying chimps during the 1960s in East Africa
and was the first researcher to observe their strong personalities,
tool-using abilities and hunting behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The London resident founded the Jane Goodall Institute for
Wildlife Research, Education and Conservation in 1977. These days,
she travels 320 days a year to encourage conservation of natural
resources as a United Nations messenger of peace, a title bestowed on
her this spring by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Telling stories of the chimps she has studied, whether of David
Greybeard squeezing her hand when she offered him a nut or Spindle's
adoption of orphan Little Mel, is the best way to get through to
younger children, Goodall said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night's benefit in Laguna Beach was sandwiched between
engagements in Costa Rica and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   It was expected to raise $100,000 for the Cougar Fund, a
Wyoming-based organization that seeks to protect mountain lions.</TE>
<TE>   Goodall stopped at the private Christian school because of a
family connection through the cougar group.</TE>
<TE>   When she talks to children, Goodall said, she tries to impress
upon them that they have power to change society.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of you makes a difference every single day," she told them.
"You cannot go through a single day without making an impact on the
world around us."</TE>

Wildlife Research, Education and Conservation in 1977. These days,
she travels 320 days a year to encourage conservation of natural
resources as a United Nations messenger of peace, a title bestowed on
her this spring by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Telling stories of the chimps she has studied, whether of David
Greybeard squeezing her hand when she offered him a nut or Spindle's
adoption of orphan Little Mel, is the best way to get through to
younger children, Goodall said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday night's benefit in Laguna Beach was sandwiched between
engagements in Costa Rica and Sacramento. It was expected to raise
$100,000 for the Cougar Fund, a Wyoming-based organization that seeks
to protect mountain lions. Goodall stopped at the private Christian
school because of a connection through the group.</TE>
<TE>   When she talks to children, Goodall said, she tries to impress
upon them that they have power to change society.</TE>
<TE>   "Each of you makes a difference every single day," she told them.
"You cannot go through a single day without making an impact on the
world around us."</TE>

<HD>James Gregory, 90; Veteran Player of Cops and Generals in
Movies and Television</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Gregory, the solid character actor known for tough-guy cop
roles, including Inspector Frank Luger, Hal Linden's superior on
television's "Barney Miller," has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Gregory died Monday of natural causes in Sedona, Ariz., where he
had lived since retiring from acting in 1983, said his niece, Laraine
Gregory-LaMonte of Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   Slender with a craggy face, dark, wavy hair and a commanding
sneer, Gregory had a half-century career with about two dozen
Broadway plays, 50 motion pictures and countless television programs.</LD>
<TE>   At his retirement in his early 70s, he was still playing
characters in their 50s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, during the heyday of the seven-year run of "Barney
Miller," Gregory shrugged off any suggestion that he specialized in
portraying law enforcement and military officers. "Most every actor
has played a lot of policemen," he said. "It's whatever's in vogue."</TE>
<TE>   But it was a vogue that seemed to surround Gregory. He made his
Broadway debut as a deputy sheriff in "Key Largo" in 1939, and played
an Air Force general in the pilot episode of television's "The
Twilight Zone" in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Having served in the Navy and Marines during World War II, he
played Cmdr. C.R. Ritchie, John F. Kennedy's commanding officer in
the 1963 movie "PT-109"; Dean Martin's superior officer in his Matt
Helm detective movies; and Ursus, an ape general in the 1970 movie
"Beneath the Planet of the Apes."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory landed his long-running "Barney Miller" role because of
his work as Det. Barney Ruditsky in the 1959-61 television series
"The Lawless Years."</TE>
<TE>   A precursor to TV series "The Untouchables," the series depicted
Ruditsky's dealings with New York gangsters in the 1920s and 1930s,
with the actual Ruditsky as technical advisor. The series prompted
Gregory, who was born in the Bronx, N.Y., to relocate to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   When "The Lawless Years" caught hold as a summer sleeper in 1959,
a Times reviewer praised Gregory as "one of the finest series actors
to come along."</TE>
<TE>   A decade and a half later, Danny Arnold, producer and co-creator
of "Barney Miller," chose Gregory for Inspector Luger.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought I had some of the characteristics of Barney Ruditsky,
a famous New York rackets cop during Prohibition," the actor said in
1979.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny was a friend of the real Ruditsky. He borrowed Barney's
first name for 'Barney Miller.' "</TE>
<TE>   During that series, which ran from 1975 to 1982, Gregory also
headed a short-lived related series called "Detective School."
Starring as Nick Hannigan, he ran a night school for sleuths, trying
to teach housewives, door-to-door salesmen and shoe store clerks how
to become private eyes.</TE>
<TE>   After establishing himself on Broadway in the 1930s and 1940s,
Gregory made his motion picture debut in the crime drama "Naked City"
in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   He was on television by 1950, working in that medium from New
York, when shows were telecast live.</TE>
<TE>   Although his stage work later lessened, Gregory always moved
easily among the venues.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that I'm able to work in all mediums is a good thing,"
he told The Times in 1959. "I consider it fortunate to be able to
bounce back and forth."</TE>
<TE>   Adept at westerns when they were in vogue, he was a regular on
three series in the late 1960s, playing President Ulysses S. Grant in
"The Wild, Wild West," Major Duncan in the comedy "F Troop" and in a
recurring role on Barbara Stanwyck's "The Big Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Among his films, Gregory earned particular notice for his
performance as Sen. John Iselin in the 1962 political thriller "The
Manchurian Candidate," starring Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Ann
Miltner.</TE>

<HD>Chief Quits as Son Joins Long Beach Police Force</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wanting to avoid any cloud of nepotism, Long Beach Police Chief
Jerome E. Lance resigned as head of the 900-officer department to
make way for his son to be hired, it was announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   While it appeared abrupt--Lance submitted his letter of
resignation late Tuesday and was gone Wednesday--the decision had
been months in the making, said his boss, Long Beach City Manager
Henry Taboada.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he agonized over the decision; he didn't want to leave,"
said Taboada, who appointed Lance a few months after his own
appointment in early 1999. "But it was a matter of the best interest
of the family. I support his decision, even though it saddens me.
Because he was a good police chief."</LD>
<TE>   Lance will remain on paid vacation and holiday time through Dec.
28. One of his three deputy chiefs, Stephen Bonswor, who has overseen
the investigations bureau, was named acting chief. Bonswor is not a
candidate for the permanent position, Taboada said.</TE>
<TE>   The search for a new chief may be slowed because the city manager
hires for it.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month the Long Beach City Council fired Taboada,
effective Oct. 4. Replacing Taboada could take six months, the
council has said.</TE>
<TE>   Some months back, Darren Lance applied to the department to become
an officer, and members of the community voiced concern at public
meetings about possible violation of Taboada's no-nepotism policy,
Taboada said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the policy could have been appealed, but he and the chief
agreed that doing so would unfairly stigmatize the younger Lance
throughout his law-enforcement career.</TE>
<TE>   Once the hiring of the younger Lance seemed imminent--he was
accepted into the city police academy--the chief wished to exit
swiftly to avoid being a "lame duck chief," said Stephen James,
president of the department's police union.</TE>
<TE>   Because hiring an officer is such a lengthy process, involving
written, physical and psychological exams and background
investigations, Lance wanted to ensure that his son had been hired
before stepping down.</TE>
<TE>   Lance ended 38 years with the department, having worked his way up
from a patrol officer.</TE>

<HD>Contra Costa Man Is Recovering From Bout With West Nile
Virus</HD>
<DH>Health: Officials say risk of illness is low. Patient may
have been infected by mosquito in Chicago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The West Nile virus has been detected in a Contra Costa man who
apparently was bitten by an infected mosquito in Chicago late last
month, state health officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man became ill on Sept. 4 and was hospitalized
with encephalitis two days later, state Health Director Diana M.
Bonita said.</LD>
<LD>   The man, who is the second California resident to known to have
contracted the disease, has been discharged from the hospital and is
recovering at home, said Ken August, a spokesman for the state
Department of Health Services.</LD>
<TE>   The state's first case of West Nile was reported earlier this
month and involved a young woman who lives in the southwestern part
of Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Another case identified in Los Angeles County surfaced a week ago:
A middle-aged Texas man who authorities believe contracted the
infection from a mosquito in his home state.</TE>
<TE>   None of the victims was identified to protect their privacy.</TE>
<TE>   August said the risk of any individual becoming ill from the virus
is very low.</TE>
<TE>   "For most Californians who are bitten by an infected mosquito,
West Nile virus will cause no illness or symptoms at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is possible that there may be small pools of infected
mosquitoes in the state, "our tests have found no evidence that the
virus exists here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Less than 1% of the bites from infected mosquitoes can cause
severe disease.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, individuals can reduce the risk of mosquito-borne
diseases by avoiding activity outside when mosquitoes are most
active.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>County health officials closed 600 feet of beach along the Newport
Beach-Huntington Beach border Wednesday after learning that a
fast-food restaurant had spilled sewage into local waterways.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 300 gallons of sewage leaked Tuesday night from a
grease-clogged line at an El Pollo Loco on Harbor Boulevard in Costa
Mesa. It flowed into a storm drain that leads to a channel that flows
into the Santa Ana River, which empties into the ocean, said Monica
Mazur, spokeswoman for the county Health Care Agency.</LD>
<LD>   Three-hundred feet on either side of the river mouth will be
closed until tests show that the water is safe. Swimming in
sewage-tainted water can cause gastrointestinal problems such as
nausea, vomiting and diarrhea; eye, ear, nose and throat infections;
and viral diseases such as hepatitis.</LD>
<TE>   The closure is the 25th time this year that a stretch of Orange
County's 42-mile coastline has been declared off-limits, Mazur said.</TE>

<LD>Joe Navarro, who has been cutting hair downtown for 46 years, is a
considerate gent who supplies a wealth of reading materials for his
male customers, including Playboy, Penthouse and National Geographic.
Until recently, though, Navarro occasionally hid the Playboys and
Penthouses in the closet of his 2nd Street shop.</LD>
<LD>   He did so when he was expecting a visit by a customer who lived
around the corner: Cardinal Roger Mahony.</LD>
<LD>   No one ever told Navarro, 74, to stash the skin mags; he just
thought it the proper thing to do.</LD>
<TE>   Navarro said Mahony "was very generous," revealing under tough
questioning by your columnist that the cardinal would fork over $20
for a $9 haircut. "And," said Navarro, brightening at the memory, "he
would get his hair cut three times a month."</TE>
<TE>   But St. Vibiana's has shut down, the archdiocese has moved to a
new cathedral several blocks away and Mahony is no longer a customer.
"He sent me a very nice letter after the last time he came in,"
Navarro said.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks for the warning: E. Rose of L.A. found an auto shop that is
very frank about its rates (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of coming clean: Aline Reynders found a restaurant that
is concerned about sanitary conditions at its tables (see
accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Trudi Dieterle of Malibu, meanwhile, spotted a business whose
damaged sign made it appear it would be ideal for laundering money
(see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Anything to slow down drivers: Apparently some residents, figuring
that speeding motorists don't care if they run over people, have
taken to posting eye-catching animal warnings. Bob Patterson of Alta
Loma saw a pooch-themed sign in Vermont (see photo). Jay Berman of
Manhattan Beach, meanwhile, spotted a sign in Canada that read,
"Caution: Blind Cat Crossing."</TE>
<TE>   Surfing 101: Congrats to UC San Diego, which has been named best
college for wave-riders on the West Coast by Surfing magazine. One
recent grad said, "You're never tempted to skip class, mainly because
the waves are always good."</TE>
<TE>   But if a hang-tenner is looking for a surfing degree, he or she
will have to enroll in Edith Cowan University in Western Australia,
the magazine points out. Cowan offers such brain-busting classes as
Surfboard Materials, Design and Manufacture, Competitive Surfing and
Event Management and Contemporary Issues in Surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Though the publication cautions young surfers to stay in school,
it did honor pro competitor Sunny Garcia as "Best Dropout." Garcia
explained that for economic reasons he had to leave school in the
ninth grade but had earned good grades until then. "I did well in
math and English," he said, and I never missed photography class. It
was the only room I knew of that had air conditioning."</TE>
<TE>   Downey must be jealous: The current issue of Back Stage West, the
trade publication for actors, carries a casting call for the movie,
"Cerritos: The Place to Be." Further investigation revealed that this
is not a full-length feature but a "video tour of the city," and the
only cast member sought is a young female narrator.</TE>
<TE>   A tour of Cerritos sounds like a fascinating project. Too bad one
of its most famous businesses is gone. Years ago the Big Yellow House
chain opened a restaurant there. Alas, the city wouldn't permit the
eatery to use its customary bright shade. So Cerritos' Big Yellow
House was beige.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Back Stage West also reports that the makers of
"Otto," a film "about a tragic love story," are searching for actors
to play rock band members. The role description adds: "Do not have to
know how to play instruments."</TE>
<TE>   Hey, over the years, I've come across plenty of rock band members
who fit that bill!</TE>

<LD>Derek Davies, 71, who ran the Far Eastern Economic Review for 25
years and turned the magazine into a leading source of
English-language news and analysis about Asia, died Sunday of liver
cancer in Antibes, in southern France.</LD>
<LD>   Davies joined the Hong Kong-based Review in 1962, when it was
printed on a single sheet of paper, and became editor two years
later. When he retired in 1989, the Review had expanded into a
magazine with a weekly circulation of 75,000.</LD>
<LD>   As editor, Davies chose reporters from different backgrounds,
including many academics, and gave them great freedom.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a lot of independence for correspondents to interpret
events in their own way," said Michael Malik, a friend and former
Review employee.</TE>
<TE>   Before joining the Review, the British-born Davies studied at
Cambridge University and worked at Reuters news agency and Britain's
Foreign Office.</TE>

<LD>Sidney Epstein, 81, a former newspaper copy boy who rose to associate
publisher and editor of the Washington Star, died Sunday at a nursing
home in Rockville, Md. He had Alzheimer's disease and pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   Epstein became editor of the Washington Star in 1978 after a long
career that began at the old Washington Herald in 1937.</LD>
<LD>   Later, as city editor of the merged Washington Times-Herald, he
reluctantly hired a young Jacqueline Bouvier as a roving
photographer.</LD>
<TE>   The socially prominent debutante, who later married John F.
Kennedy, had studied photography at the Sorbonne, using a
35-millimeter Leica.</TE>
<TE>   Epstein hired her for $25 a week after she mastered a less fancy
camera, the large-format Speed Graphic.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he played a major role in coverage of Kennedy's
assassination and the riots in Washington after the murder of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Wilmington, Del., Epstein attended George Washington
University but left to pursue his journalism career. During World War
II, he served with the Marines in the Pacific Theater, then worked as
a rewrite man for the Times-Herald.</TE>
<TE>   He joined the Star in 1954 and remained until it closed in 1981.</TE>

<HD>Ryder's Shoplifting Trial Set for Oct. 7</HD>
<DH>Plea: Unable to agree on a deal, attorneys seem eager to
face a jury.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Plea negotiations in actress Winona Ryder's shoplifting case have
stalled, prompting attorneys to set an Oct. 7 trial date.</LD>
<LD>   Shepard Kopp, one of Ryder's attorneys, said that there had been
an impasse in the discussions and that Ryder was looking forward to
going to trial "to prove herself innocent of the charges."</LD>
<LD>   Though neither side ruled out a last-minute plea deal, Kopp said,
"The odds are that this case will go to trial."</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County district attorney's office spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said her office had made an offer that is now off the table.
"That clears the way for the trial," she said, adding that
prosecutors are eager to present the case against Ryder to a jury.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be presenting our evidence," Gibbons said. "We feel it's
very strong. We'll let a jury decide."</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, star of such films as "Girl, Interrupted" and "Little
Women," is accused of shoplifting about $6,000 worth of merchandise
from a Beverly Hills Saks Fifth Avenue in December.</TE>
<TE>   She is charged with four felony counts: second-degree burglary,
grand theft, vandalism and possession of a controlled substance.
Ryder could face more than three years in prison if convicted on all
counts.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox ruled in June
that there was enough evidence for Ryder to stand trial, after a Saks
security investigator testified that she saw the actress snip
anti-theft tags off two black purses she never paid for.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, who is free on $20,000 bail, was not at the brief hearing
at the Beverly Hills courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Kopp said outside court that Fox had suggested a settlement offer
that was "somewhat different" from the offer made by prosecutors, but
he would not elaborate. The district attorney's office and Fox also
declined to disclose what the offers were.</TE>

<HD>Inspection Rule on News Vans Relaxed</HD>
<DH>Safety: State panel backs away from quarterly vehicle
checks after protest by ABC TV, which said proposal might cost too
much.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the urging of ABC TV, state officials have toned down safety rules
prompted by a news van accident that nearly killed KABC-TV reporter
Adrienne Alpert.</LD>
<LD>   Tough safety standards and frequent inspections of television
trucks equipped with microwave masts were proposed earlier this year
by the state's Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the new rules--the nation's first--would prevent
news reporters and photographers from accidentally raising van
antennas into overhead power lines.</LD>
<TE>   Alpert was severely burned in 2000 when she stepped out of a news
van after its microwave mast had been raised into a 19,980-volt power
line along Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   News vans beam microwave signals from antenna masts as high as 70
feet to relay pictures from news scenes to broadcast stations.</TE>
<TE>   There are an estimated 1,000 news vans in California. Experts have
warned that each has the potential to kill hundreds if their antennas
touch overhead lines at a crowded news event, such as the start of a
marathon race.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed safety rules would require the trucks to be equipped
with "constant pressure" mast-raising switches that would force
technicians to press a button while standing where they can see the
antenna rising.</TE>
<TE>   Vans also would be equipped with carpenter-style levels to show
whether they are parked at a slant, which could cause a mast to lean
into power lines.</TE>
<TE>   Other requirements would include safety manuals, warning signs,
lights that illuminate the mast at night and an audible alarm that
would sound if the van is driven with the antenna up.</TE>
<TE>   Cal/OSHA officials initially proposed requiring quarterly field
inspections of news vans to guarantee that the safety devices were in
place. But that part of the recommendation has been dropped,
officials said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Mannetta, director of health and safety for ABC Inc.,
protested to Cal/OSHA that the inspections were unnecessary and would
"unintentionally cause logistical and potential financial hardships
to the news-gathering abilities of broadcast entities in California."
His company supports the other recommendations, he said.</TE>
<TE>   As a compromise, state officials are now proposing that van checks
be yearly instead of quarterly. Board members will vote on the
regulations Oct. 17 in Sacramento, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcast unions have endorsed the tougher inspection requirement.
Some say that pressure to quickly set up cameras and cover breaking
news has led to the disconnection of safety switches, allowing
microwave masts to be raised unattended while photographers and
reporters set up live shots.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer of the mast used on Alpert's KABC-TV news van has
asserted that its safety switch was intentionally bypassed. "Somebody
took the springs out. I saw it with my own eyes," said Steven
Pinkley, a manager of the Will-Burt Co. of Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert, a popular figure among competing reporters in Los Angeles,
suffered third-degree burns that forced the amputation of her lower
right leg, left forearm, part of her left foot and several fingers
from her right hand when she "grounded" herself, and the electric
current surged from the TV truck and through her.</TE>
<TE>   Strict safety rules, including van inspections every three months,
have been supported by most Los Angeles TV news personalities.
Patrick Healy of KNBC-TV, Ron Olsen of KTLA-TV, Jane Yamamoto of
KTTV-TV, Pat Harvey of KCAL-TV and Drew Griffin of KCBS-TV are among
more than six dozen who have written letters demanding the
regulations. Two dozen news van operators from KABC-TV signed a
petition backing the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Chambers, news anchor for KCOP-TV, urged state regulators to
strengthen the rules even further so that all TV newsroom workers
"understand the risks the crews face in getting news stories."</TE>

<HD>Valley Candidate Floats Boroughs Plan</HD>
<DH>Secession: Richman's idea for increasing local control not
supported by other mayoral hopefuls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley mayoral hopeful Keith Richman on Wednesday said
the region should be divided into seven semi-independent boroughs if
it splits from Los Angeles, an idea blasted by other secession
candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a Republican assemblyman from Northridge, said each
borough would have an elected commission to make local planning and
budgetary decisions.</LD>
<LD>   "The goal is to empower and involve citizens in their local
government and better provide services to the residents of the San
Fernando Valley," Richman said.</LD>
<TE>   Other contenders for Valley mayor, a job that will exist only if
secession wins at the polls on Nov. 5, said Richman's plan would
create more bureaucracy when one of the goals of the breakup campaign
is to shrink government.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like it's just another layer of government bureaucracy,"
said candidate Mel Wilson. "That doesn't sound like something a
Republican would support."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he would give decision-making powers to neighborhood
councils in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Another candidate, Marc Strassman, said Richman's proposed
boroughs, with populations of about 200,000 each, would be too big.
He said the Valley eventually should be carved into even smaller
cities, with populations of 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the City Council rejected a borough plan for all of L.A.
as an alternative to Valley and Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said his plan, which would require voter approval in an
independent Valley, would combine the benefits of secession and
boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   He proposed that the boroughs include two Valley city council
districts each. Communities would be kept together as much as
possible. For instance, one borough would consist of Chatsworth,
Northridge and Granada Hills, and another would take in Encino,
Tarzana and Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Two council members would sit on each borough panel, alongside
five elected commissioners, Richman said. Appointed managers would
oversee services at seven borough halls.</TE>
<TE>   The borough commissions would be given a share of the budget to
spend on local priorities, while the Valley mayor and council would
handle citywide affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski and county
Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Don Knabe objected Wednesday to a
Hollywood secession mailer that included their photographs as members
of the Local Agency Formation Commission, which approved the breakup
measures for the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski voted against secession as a member of LAFCO and said
the mailer makes it appear that she supports a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a dirty campaign tactic singularly designed to confuse and
trick voters," Miscikowski said, asking for the mailer to be
recalled. Yaroslavsky and Knabe are neutral on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, president of the Hollywood secession group, said
the mailer is not misleading because LAFCO did vote to schedule the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand by it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later Wednesday, a small group of secession supporters and
opponents waved placards and shouted slogans outside a "Meet the
Mayor" session in Hollywood. Mayor James K. Hahn met with residents
at the Fire Department museum on Cahuenga Boulevard, hearing
complaints about prostitution and drug dealing in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists held signs saying "EIDC=Enron," a reference to
the spending controversy surrounding the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. The quasi-public agency donated $10,000 to Hahn's
anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of a breakup countered with signs proclaiming "I Love Los
Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Candidate Touts Plan for Boroughs in a Valley City</HD>
<DH>Secession: Richman's idea for increasing local control not
supported by other mayoral hopefuls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Fernando Valley mayoral hopeful Keith Richman on Wednesday said
the region should be divided into seven semi-independent boroughs if
it splits from Los Angeles, an idea blasted by other secession
candidates.</LD>
<LD>   Richman, a Republican assemblyman from Northridge, said each
borough would have an elected commission to make local planning and
budgetary decisions.</LD>
<LD>   "The goal is to empower and involve citizens in their local
government and better provide services to the residents of the San
Fernando Valley," Richman said.</LD>
<TE>   Other contenders for Valley mayor, a job that will exist only if
secession wins at the polls on Nov. 5, said Richman's plan would
create more bureaucracy when one of the goals of the breakup campaign
is to shrink government.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like it's just another layer of government bureaucracy,"
said candidate Mel Wilson. "That doesn't sound like something a
Republican would support."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he would give decision-making powers to neighborhood
councils in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Another candidate, Marc Strassman, said Richman's proposed
boroughs, with populations of about 200,000 each, would be too big.
He said the Valley eventually should be carved into even smaller
cities, with populations of 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the City Council rejected a borough plan for all of L.A.
as an alternative to Valley and Hollywood secession.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said his plan, which would require voter approval in an
independent Valley, would combine the benefits of secession and
boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   He proposed that the boroughs include two Valley city council
districts each. Communities would be kept together as much as
possible. For instance, one borough would consist of Chatsworth,
Northridge and Granada Hills, and another would take in Encino,
Tarzana and Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Two council members would sit on each borough panel, alongside
five elected commissioners, Richman said. Appointed managers would
oversee services at seven borough halls.</TE>
<TE>   The borough commissions would be given a share of the budget to
spend on local priorities, while the Valley mayor and council would
handle citywide affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Los Angeles Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski and county
Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Don Knabe objected Wednesday to a
Hollywood secession mailer that included their photographs as members
of the Local Agency Formation Commission, which approved the breakup
measures for the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Miscikowski voted against secession as a member of LAFCO and said
the mailer makes it appear that she supports a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a dirty campaign tactic singularly designed to confuse and
trick voters," Miscikowski said, asking for the mailer to be
recalled. Yaroslavsky and Knabe are neutral on secession.</TE>
<TE>   Gene La Pietra, president of the Hollywood secession group, said
the mailer is not misleading because LAFCO did vote to schedule the
election.</TE>
<TE>   "We stand by it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Later Wednesday, a small group of secession supporters and
opponents waved placards and shouted slogans outside a "Meet the
Mayor" session in Hollywood. Mayor James K. Hahn met with residents
at the Fire Department museum on Cahuenga Boulevard, hearing
complaints about prostitution and drug dealing in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The secessionists held signs saying "EIDC=Enron," a reference to
the spending controversy surrounding the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. The quasi-public agency donated $10,000 to Hahn's
anti-secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of a breakup countered with signs proclaiming "I Love Los
Angeles."</TE>

<HD>Accord in Abortion Lawsuit Disclosed</HD>
<DH>Courts: UC Berkeley paid $115,000 in 2000 to an assistant
coach who alleged that her boss had tried to force her to end a
pregnancy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA M. SCULLY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>UC Berkeley paid $115,000 to a former assistant women's basketball
coach to settle a lawsuit in which she alleged that her boss had
tried to coerce her into getting an abortion, according to a campus
official.</LD>
<LD>   The assistant coach, Sharrona Reaves, received the settlement in
2000 as a result of her pregnancy discrimination lawsuit against the
university and its former head coach, Marianne Stanley, now coaching
the Washington Mystics in the Women's National Basketball Assn.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement was subject to a nondisclosure agreement but the
Washington Post reported it this week.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Smith, assistant chancellor for legal affairs at UC Berkeley,
confirmed the settlement but would not comment on the details of the
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Reaves, reached at her Nashville home, said the Post article about
her deposition and settlement was accurate, but she would not discuss
the case further, citing the nondisclosure agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley declined to comment Wednesday. She has denied trying to
force an abortion, according to the Post.</TE>
<TE>   Reaves, then known by her maiden name, Alexander, was an assistant
basketball coach for Troy State University in Troy, Ala., in 1998
when Stanley recruited her for UC Berkeley's assistant coach
position.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley offered Reaves the job and she accepted it.</TE>
<TE>   In her deposition, Reaves said she did not mention at the time
that she was pregnant. Reaves reportedly told Stanley about her
pregnancy later at a dinner before she had signed a contract, and
offered to withdraw as a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Reaves alleged, Stanley was supportive of her staying
but Stanley later told her the demands of the job would be too much
for a pregnant woman.</TE>
<TE>   Reaves contended that she told Stanley she had scheduled an
abortion at an Atlanta clinic and that Stanley then paid for the trip
and offered to pay for the abortion, according to the depositions
quoted in the Post.</TE>
<TE>   After talking to the child's father, whom she subsequently
married, Reaves decided not to have an abortion. She said that she
tried to convince Stanley she could do the job while pregnant, but
that Stanley said it wouldn't be possible and asked for Reaves'
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley, in her deposition, said she had never encouraged Reaves
to have an abortion, but she did not think a pregnant woman could do
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Both women testified that they later tried to resolve their
differences but couldn't. Reaves alleged that Stanley fired her.
Reaves, who now has two children, never again coached at the college
level and said she thinks that the lawsuit may have hurt her chances
of getting hired.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Niguel Man Arrested on Sexual Assault Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: Officials say he claimed to use 'sensitive touching'
to heal, posing as an acupressurist.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Laguna Niguel man who posed as an acupressurist was arrested
Wednesday on suspicion of sexually assaulting patients, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Shin Higashiura, 55, was arrested at his business on Jasmine Creek
Road, Laguna Hills. He was being held without bail at Orange County
Jail on suspicion of digitally penetrating a patient through fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Higashiura practiced shinkei, a form of shiatsu that treats
illnesses by addressing pressure points.</LD>
<TE>   He is not a licensed acupressurist and has no business permit,
said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said that Higashiura claimed to be able to "heal"
patients through "sensitive touching" in the groin area. Some clients
signed consent forms allowing him to touch their breasts and genital
areas, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials began their investigation after a woman complained that
she was inappropriately touched during a therapy session.</TE>
<TE>   In a videotape released by the Sheriff's Department, Higashiura
was shown treating a woman while his assistant told her that she had
a hormone imbalance and, once cured, would attract more men. The
assistant has not been charged.</TE>
<TE>   Higashiura was also investigated in Morgan City, La., and in
Houston where he claimed in ads to have cured Houston Astros athletes
and actress Sally Field. He closed his business in 1999 after the
state's health department required him to register, according to
Texas records.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there may be more than 50 victims in Orange County.
Anyone with information is asked to call (714) 647-7419.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor's Slaying Grips a Town</HD>
<DH>Bakersfield: Private life of the victim, who took in a
colleague's son who had drug problems, draws scrutiny as
investigation continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>In any town, the murder of a top law enforcement officer would be
news. But in this bastion of conservatism in California's oil patch,
the killing of Kern County Assistant Dist. Atty. Stephen M. Tauzer is
the No. 1 topic not only on the evening news but in the bars and
grocery stores along California 99, where the roar of traffic going
elsewhere reminds people how lucky they are to live in Bakersfield.</LD>
<LD>   To many people here, Tauzer's white hair and avuncular jowls
comprised the face of law enforcement. A legendary workaholic, he not
only handled the toughest criminal cases, but wrote budgets and
analyzed legislation.</LD>
<LD>   Fair, conscientious, deliberative, kind. These were some of the
terms associated with him. Now that he is dead, people are learning a
new vocabulary to describe the 57-year-old prosecutor as Tauzer and
his lifestyle come under the same kind of microscopic examination he
brought to the most ordinary murder trial.</LD>
<TE>   The events have also shined an uncomfortable spotlight on the
local prosecutor's office after Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels was forced to
declare a conflict of interest in a prosecution because of Tauzer's
personal involvement in the case.</TE>
<TE>   The body of Kern County's No. 2 prosecutor was found in his garage
Sunday, apparently by a neighbor. Tauzer had been stabbed at least
once in the head and suffered other head trauma that the Sheriff's
Department has declined to describe.</TE>
<TE>   While speculation at first centered on some of the high-profile
prosecutions he had handled, including grand jury corruption
investigations in the small towns of Taft and Arvin, details about
his private life have most recently generated the most speculation
around town.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzer did not have any declared enemies. He lived alone in a tidy
shake-roof home in northwest Bakersfield and apparently divided his
life between work and helping young people with problems.</TE>
<TE>   He was a longtime volunteer with the Boy Scouts, working closely
with special-needs kids, and was interested in politics. His yard was
often staked with signs for one candidate or another.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes word that he took in a young man with drug problems, an
association that apparently sparked a heated outburst from the young
man's father. Court records also show that Tauzer intervened with the
courts on behalf of the young man, Lance C. Hillis, on more than one
occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "I am optimistic about Lance, his plans and his chances for the
future," Tauzer wrote to Judge Lee Felice of the Kern County Superior
Court in June. "I will continue to offer him whatever support I can."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever role Tauzer's letters played, Hillis was able to avoid a
prison sentence for possession of methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   The support Tauzer offered included a place to live. Records show
that Hillis, who was then about 21, listed Tauzer's address as his
home last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis was attending a treatment program in Northern California
when he was killed in an auto accident on Aug. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis' father, Chris Hillis, was a longtime investigator for the
district attorney's office. Officials in the office say he and Tauzer
had been close friends until Tauzer began to take an interest in his
son's drug problems.</TE>
<TE>   "They recently had a tremendous falling out" over Lance and how to
handle his drug problems, said Jagels. "His dad was a devout believer
that you have to hit rock bottom" before you can solve drug problems.</TE>
<TE>   To Chris Hillis, rock bottom apparently meant going to prison for
a while, something Tauzer opposed.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve felt Lance needed support," Jagels said.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, according to law enforcement officials, the elder
Hillis struck Tauzer, but no charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   Jagels described Tauzer's relationship with Lance Hillis as kind
of a godfather to a godson. In his letters to the courts, Tauzer said
he had known Lance since he was 5.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Tauzer's involvement in the case forced the district
attorney's office to declare a conflict of interest in the Hillis
prosecution. The state attorney general's office took over the case.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if the Tauzer murder investigation is shining an
uncomfortable light on his office, Jagels replied, "I suppose it
does."</TE>
<TE>   Sources said detectives have interviewed the elder Hillis in
connection with Tauzer's death.</TE>
<TE>   Hillis, who now operates a drug treatment center in Bakersfield,
denies having anything to do with the murder. "I just want to grieve
my son's death," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the new information, Sheriff's Cmdr. Martin Williamson
insisted that detectives "have not focused our investigation on any
individual."</TE>
<TE>   Williamson also insisted he remains "very optimistic" that the
crime will be solved in the short term.</TE>

<LD>   "She's talking about the charro ones," Teresa Velez said coolly to
another employee, who hustled the woman into the shoe section.</LD>
<LD>   Velez didn't have to see a picture or get more details. At
Olverita's, a cramped, color-saturated gift shop that specializes in
traditional clothing from virtually every region of Mexico, the
workers know their jarocho gear from their huichol gear as plainly as
teenagers know their Nikes and Reeboks.</LD>
<TE>   "I sometimes have people that come in and say, 'What's the
traditional dress from Colima? I'm presenting myself in it and I
don't know what it looks like,' " Velez said. "The people have to
know about the history of their regions. They come to Olvera Street.
The whole street is Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   Well, si and no. And that, in an odd way, is part of the street's
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Situated in a downtown district officially known as El Pueblo de
Los Angeles Historical Monument, Olvera Street is a narrow, brick
pedestrian lane lined with shops, sizzling taco stands and open-air
restaurants. A leafy plaza lies at one end of the street, just north
of the Hollywood Freeway and City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Some consider the street the birthplace of Los Angeles. It
features the Avila Adobe, built in 1818 and billed as the "oldest
existing house in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   But like many things in this city, the surface doesn't necessarily
reflect reality--or history.</TE>
<TE>   "Olvera Street is an imagined space, an invented space," said
William Estrada, a curator for the monument and a doctoral candidate
in history at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of innocent interpretations. I've heard, 'This is
the oldest street in L.A.' or 'This is what L.A. looked like 200
years ago.' Olvera Street was created in 1930 by an Anglo woman,
Christine Sterling, who wanted to create a Mexican marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   At least 25 historic buildings dot the area, such as Avila Adobe,
built in 1818, and La Placita, the church built nearby in 1781 that
remains a venerated and popular house of worship for the Latino
community.</TE>
<TE>   But the Olvera Street of restaurants, gift shops and noontime
mariachi music on the plaza grandstand is relatively new, almost
contrived. Still, this doesn't preclude the street from morphing into
"real space," Estrada said.</TE>
<TE>   When churchgoers spill out of La Placita on Sundays, with flocks
of children in white suits and dresses, many stroll about the plaza
or sit on benches, snacking on churros or paletas, frozen fruit bars.
Newly arrived immigrants are drawn to the plaza simply for what it
evokes in them: tinges of home.</TE>
<TE>   "I usually can understand the difference between invented and
imagined space and real space," Estrada said. "That's the thing about
Los Angeles, sometimes I see a blur.... [Olvera Street] has acquired
a kind of genuineness, a la L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Olvera Street's history has been a little blurry since the
beginning. Originally Wine Street, the street was renamed after the
county's first judge, Agustin Olvera, in 1877.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 20th century, as the city's commercial center moved
south toward present-day downtown, the area known as El Pueblo
languished into slumhood. A substation for the city's electrical
streetcars provided constant noise and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sterling, who started a campaign to save the city's
historic center in 1926. The City Council closed Olvera Street to
vehicle traffic in 1929. And the following year, on Easter Sunday,
Sterling's market opened to what historical accounts called "great
festivities," with promises to "preserve and present the customs and
trades of early California."</TE>
<TE>   True to Sterling's vision, merchants along Olvera Street still
sell earthen wares from Oaxaca. But shoppers also can find kitschy
Mexican favorites, such as lurid T-shirts honoring tequila, or
absurdly oversized sombreros. American flags sell alongside Mexican
ones.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers and students from all over the Southland come to find
regional costumes for holidays and performances. And self-professed
Chicanos come to stock up on revolutionary books or T-shirts
emblazoned with Emiliano Zapata or Che Guevara.</TE>
<TE>   Tourists, meanwhile, make sure Olvera Street is never a lonely
place. The smells of freshly pressed leather belts and cooking lard
call them. The smells call people such as 61-year-old Sacramento
firefighter Trini Campos and his wife Pamela, 49. Campos last visited
Olvera Street 50 years ago with his Mexican grandmother, who, like
him now, came looking for a little bit of home.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Olvera Street's less than authentic past, people such as
Campos and Estrada still feel that sense of "genuineness" from the
area. "Everyone falls back on their history," Campos said. "If you
want a small part of it, come here."</TE>
<TE>   Velez, the shop manager, said the Mexican American community
prizes Olvera Street for the feeling of proximity that it gives then.</TE>
<TE>   "This street represents the not-forgetting, from the guarache to
the molcajete," Velez said, referring to sandals and a stone mortar
and pestle. "When we're here, we're closer to Mexico, to that
Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   So what lies in the future for a quasi-historic Mexican boardwalk
created by a woman named Christine Sterling? A little of
everything--this is Los Angeles, after all. Plans are underway to
restore more of El Pueblo's buildings and open more museums,
including one for local Chinese American history and another for
Italian American history at the Italian Hall. There also have been
talks of a transportation museum.</TE>
<TE>   Olvera Street is the "heart of L.A." and is going a through period
of revival, Estrada said. "In a postmodern way, it really is a window
or prism through which we can see the whole city."</TE>

<HD>'Two Marias' Could Go Home in Six Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recovery of formerly conjoined twins is on track, and doctors at
UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital on Wednesday said the 1-year-olds
may be returning to Guatemala within six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "The twins are much better today than they were last week, and
they are not as well today as they are going to be next week," said
Dr. Jorge Lazareff, the pediatric neurosurgeon coordinating the
girls' care.</LD>
<LD>   Maria Teresa Quiej Alvarez and Maria de Jesus, whose heads were
separated in a 22-hour operation on Aug. 6, remain in serious but
stable condition, doctors said. The complex surgery required that
doctors cut through bone, redirect shared blood vessels and cover
exposed brain tissue with skin.</LD>
<TE>   Ever since, the "two Marias," as they are known among the
hospital's nursing staff, have continued to impress the 50 UCLA
physicians, surgeons and nurses who donated an estimated $1.5 million
worth of care.</TE>
<TE>   "Maria de Jesus is very playful, and likes to eat," said nurse
Clarice Marsh. "She blows kisses and plays peekaboo with her
blanket."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Teresa, she said, "is not as playful. But she likes to be
held and is slowly becoming more interactive."</TE>
<TE>   Lazareff said there is "no reason to believe that both girls will
not have similar potential of any other 1-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   The acute care "will finish by the end of October," he said.
"Guatemala has very good medical care and is eager to take them."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA plastic surgeons on Tuesday completed a series of procedures
to promote skin growth in sections of the girls' scalps that are
healing slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "We cleaned debris from Maria Teresa's skin flaps and applied a
special skin substitute that encourages cell growth and promotes
healing," said Dr. Henry Kawamoto Jr.</TE>
<TE>   The same procedure was performed on her sister during routine
surgery on Aug. 30, and her scalp has grown enough to cover her
skull.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Maria de Jesus enjoys watching nurses read books to her, eats
solid food, holds her own bottle, and "laughs at nothing in
particular because she's just a happy baby," said nurse Michelle
Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Teresa, who has undergone three surgical procedures to
remove blood from her brain, is recovering more slowly. But nurses
said she makes eye contact with visitors, reacts to touch and
responds to musical toys.</TE>
<TE>   "No one knew how they'd progress, because the operation had never
been done before," Murray said. "But I saw them this morning, and
they're doing beautifully."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, U.S. Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao visited the
twins' medical team and urged that more people consider careers in
nursing.</TE>
<TE>   "The nation is spellbound by what you've done," Chao told the
nurses.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, Alba Leticia Alvarez, 22, and Wenceslao Quiej Lopez,
21, were unavailable for comment. But nurses said they visit the
girls daily, helping feed them and change their diapers.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, hospital officials have been preparing to
transfer the girls to a Guatemalan hospital for continued
rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be keeping in touch with these twins," Marsh said. "We're
going to know them forever."</TE>

<LD>Police arrested a 36-year-old Ventura man on suspicion of robbery
after he allegedly punched a man paying for gas at a service station
and took his money. George Mami was arrested about an hour after the
incident, which occurred about 4 p.m. Tuesday at a Union 76 station
at Telephone Road and Victoria Avenue, Ventura Police Lt. Skip Young
said.</LD>
<LD>   Young said Ryan Hitchcock, 21, was assaulted and robbed of $100 by
a man who fled in a motor home. Hitchcock told police that he and a
friend followed the suspect to a residence in Camarillo before
returning to Ventura to notify police. Mami was taken into custody a
short time later near the gas station, Young said.</LD>

<LD>   Bernal, an employee at Somis-based Grether Farming, tried to pass
a vehicle stopped at an ungated rail crossing on a private road near
the Hagle Tree Farm when the train hit his pickup, investigators

<HD>Women on Death Row Surrender DNA Samples</HD>
<DH>Evidence: The 13 forgo bid to gain exemption from a state
law requiring specimens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Women prisoners on California's death row, who had asked the state
Supreme Court to exempt them from giving up DNA samples, submitted to
the inevitable Wednesday and voluntarily provided the specimens,
officials reported.</LD>
<LD>   All 13 of the condemned at the state prison for women at
Chowchilla provided blood and saliva specimens one day after Gov.
Gray Davis signed a bill that authorizes the use of "reasonable"
force on inmates who refuse to provide them voluntarily.</LD>
<LD>   The new law will not take effect until Jan. 1, but the women were
offered the opportunity to give their DNA immediately and agreed to
do so, said spokesman Stephen Green of the Youth and Adult
Correctional Agency.</LD>
<TE>   Green said the women were informed that Davis approved the bill
and that it will authorize prison officials to apply force to gain
compliance. He said the women recognized that volunteering was
preferable to force.</TE>
<TE>   Green said men on San Quentin's death row will be offered the same
opportunity next month, although some of the approximately 600
inmates have already submitted their DNA.</TE>
<TE>   "Death row men is the group we're most interested in," said Nathan
Barankin, a spokesman for Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires every felon held in county jails and state
prisons to provide a DNA specimen, which is filed in a vast databank
for use in investigating unsolved crimes, some of them decades old.
Since 1992, 145 "cold hit" cases have been cracked by DNA evidence,
Barankin said.</TE>
<TE>   Corrections officials have estimated that 350 to 400 criminals are
refusing to surrender their DNA for fear that they will implicate
themselves in other crimes and be prosecuted again.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and others predict that convicts' DNA evidence will result
in cracking many such cases.</TE>

<HD>FBI Warns of Chechen-Led Al Qaeda Plot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Against a backdrop of missed warnings about the Sept. 11 attacks, FBI
officials issued a bulletin Wednesday warning of an alleged plan by
Al Qaeda members to hijack an airliner in the U.S. using Muslim
extremists of non-Arabic appearance.</LD>
<LD>   "Purportedly, Al Qaeda members have discussed using Chechen
Muslims affiliated with Al Qaeda but already present in the U.S. for
such operations in order to avoid security scrutiny at airports," it
said. "Once aboard the aircraft as many as 10 or 20 hijackers seated
in first class would overwhelm the crew and seize control."</LD>
<LD>   Also, the bulletin said, Al Qaeda members purportedly have
discussed using "improvised explosive device components transported
onto commercial aircraft in carry-on luggage. The components ...
would appear to be nonthreatening but would become highly explosive."</LD>
<TE>   The sourcing of the information suggests that it was based upon
"discussions" among Al Qaeda members before last year's terrorist
attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, according to the
bulletin.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI possesses no new information indicating that such
operational planning is currently being pursued by the Al Qaeda
network or any other group. However, law enforcement and security
agencies should remain alert to the possibility," the warning said.</TE>

<HD>Web Drug Dealers Targeted</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Sellers of 'date rape' pill are focus of
nationwide crackdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a clampdown on Internet drug dealers, federal, state and local
authorities said Wednesday they have made arrests and conducted
searches in dozens of U.S. cities where traffickers have used
computers to sell the "date rape" drug GHB.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators conducted more than 150 searches and made a number
of arrests in a law enforcement sweep in more than 70 U.S. cities,
marking the first probe of its kind involving the Internet and GHB, a
federal law enforcement official said.</LD>
<LD>   The official, who requested anonymity, said about 25 dealers were
considered primary targets in the investigation, which began two
years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The traffickers operated Web sites where customers could log on
and put in their orders for GHB and similar drugs, which would then
be mailed to them.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and Drug Enforcement Administration
Director Asa Hutchinson planned to detail the operation at a news
conference today.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the Customs Service and the
FBI also participated in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   GHB is a mix of common industrial chemicals that Congress outlawed
several years ago. The drug and its derivatives act as central
nervous system depressants and cause drowsiness, dizziness and loss
of inhibition.</TE>
<TE>   Education efforts have been aimed at warning women about sexual
predators who could spike their drinks with the drug.</TE>
<TE>   The DEA has documented 72 deaths from GHB and its derivatives.</TE>

<LD>Got allergies? Asthma? You might blame Mom for keeping such a clean

<LD>   A study of more than 800 rural European children ages 6 to 13
found that the kids living in the dustiest environments were less
likely to suffer from asthma and hay fever.</LD>
<LD>   The research in today's issue of the New England Journal of
Medicine was another sign that kids raised in the cleanest conditions
face a greater risk of developing a hypersensitivity to substances
that trigger allergic reactions.</LD>

<HD>Daschle, in Effort to Defuse Iraq Issue, Attacks Bush on
Economy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Struggling to change the nation's focus from Iraq to issues closer to
home, Democrats on Wednesday stepped up their attack on President
Bush's economic policies, accusing him of squandering the federal
budget surplus, throwing people out of work and sending the stock
market into the tank.</LD>
<LD>   The sweeping broadside was launched by Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) just a few hours after he had met with Bush over
breakfast and somberly pledged bipartisan support for a U.S.
challenge to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "It takes leadership, not only with regard to international and
foreign policy, but leadership here at home on economic policy as
well," Daschle said in a speech on the Senate floor.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans dismissed the attack as a desperate political maneuver
by Daschle that illustrates growing concern among Democrats that
their agenda has been eclipsed by the debate about Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "He would like to change the subject," said Senate Minority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.).</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's speech was the latest sortie in a larger battle between
the parties to shape what issues are on voters' minds in November's
election. While talk of war has spotlighted the foreign policy
concerns that seem to play to GOP political strengths, Democrats are
trying to return to domestic issues they believe work more to their
political advantage: Social Security, controlling prescription drug
costs, the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting tug-of-war has produced a climate in Congress that
has been long on rhetorical flourish and short on legislative
progress. Even though there is a crushing pile of unfinished
legislative business before lawmakers--all 13 spending bills needed
to finance government in the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, a major
reorganization of homeland security programs, a rewrite of the
nation's energy policy--both the House and Senate are moving at a
snail's pace.</TE>
<TE>   The stalemates over spending bills have left the House so
paralyzed that its Republican leaders are struggling to find bills to
bring to the floor. Highlights this week have included measures to
commend historically black colleges and name post offices--and
partisan resolutions blaming the Senate for stalling welfare reform
and a repeal of the estate tax.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of legislative action, the Capitol has become
mainly a backdrop for news conferences and speeches seeking to set
the tone for the fall campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, having little stomach for fighting Bush on foreign
policy issues, are trying to turn the heat up on other issues. They
are pushing more spending to aid drought-stricken regions. They are
circulating a petition to force House GOP leaders to take up a bill
to speed the marketing of lower-cost generic drugs. The Campaign for
America's Future, a labor-backed group, this week is releasing a
state-by-state analysis of the impact of the stock market drop on
401(k) retirement savings.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Dow Jones goes down 350 points again and people's
401(k)s become 201(k)s, their IRAs become IOUs [and] people get
worried," said Peter Fenn, a Democratic political consultant. "The
front-burner issues are economic pocketbook issues."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Meehan, a senior advisor to Daschle and the Democratic
National Committee, said that as the party tries to spotlight
economic issues, "the calendar will help us." He expects voters will
be reminded of the economy's woes when new unemployment statistics
are released in early October and as investors begin to receive
retirement account reports after Sept. 30 that reflect recent
investment losses.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's speech amounted to a compendium of the party's
complaints about Bush's economic policy, consuming more than 30
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He blamed Bush's policies for the loss of 2 million jobs, weak
economic growth and a stock market plunge that amounted to a
$4.5-trillion drop in value.</TE>
<TE>   He complained that Bush and his fellow Republicans were offering
no policies to remedy the situation, except for tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "They have one economic all-purpose antidote for everything, and
that is tax cuts, tax cuts largely dedicated to those at the very
top," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Daschle did not propose what many analysts believe logically
follows his critique of Bush's fiscal policy: a repeal of any part of
the administration's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax-cut package that
took effect last year.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans argued that Daschle has little standing to complain
about Bush's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. said Daschle
"continues ... a pattern of total default of leadership."</TE>
<TE>   He termed Daschle's speech "a very dispiriting and disappointing
performance; I'm tempted to say 'tantrum.' "</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Daniels acknowledged that because of the
struggling economy, government tax receipts are coming in even lower
than the White House's reduced revenue estimates of just 10 weeks
ago. But he said that White House projections for the budget deficit
remain unchanged because of a slowdown in government spending.</TE>

<HD>Bush Orders Faster Environmental Reviews for Transit
Projects</HD>
<DH>Regulation: He calls some of the programs vital to the
economy. Critics see an end run.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush directed federal agencies on Wednesday to accelerate
environmental reviews of high-priority transportation projects that
he said are vital to the economy.</LD>
<LD>   The order, immediately criticized as an attempt to circumvent a
landmark environmental law, calls on the Transportation secretary to
create a list of projects for expedited review.</LD>
<LD>   For those projects, the order says, "agencies shall to the maximum
extent practicable expedite" reviews for permits or other approvals,
and take other necessary action consistent with "available resources
and applicable laws."</LD>
<TE>   Some reviews involve environmental impact statements, which can
take years. But most are environmental assessments, which can be done
in months.</TE>
<TE>   A White House statement said moving ahead with public work
projects "in an efficient and environmentally sound manner is
essential to the well-being of the American people and a strong
American economy."</TE>
<TE>   A Cabinet-level task force would review the priority list every
few months and develop ways to make it easier to get the proper
approvals.</TE>
<TE>   The order comes while the White House is conducting a review of
the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act, which requires lengthy
environmental studies and public comments to detail the effects a
proposed project would have on the environment and ways to minimize
that impact.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the White House Council on Environmental Quality,
which is overseeing the broad review of the 1970 statute, have said
that they hope to update a law that often means bureaucratic delays
for developers, loggers and others.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have said they worry the intent of the review is
more far-reaching.</TE>
<TE>   "Any and all reviews under this executive order will fully comply
with NEPA and all other environmental statutes," Scott McClellan, a
spokesman for the White House, said.</TE>
<TE>   Speeding these projects, he said, can ease congestion and reduce
pollution at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   The typical time for environmental reviews of major highway
projects is four years, while airport runway proposals take three
years, McClellan said.</TE>
<TE>   Deron Lovaas, a transportation specialist with Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental group, said Bush's order seemed to
chip away at environmental safeguards. He said federal highway data
show that delays with transportation projects are usually caused by a
project's complexity or lack of money, not environmental reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a way to circumvent NEPA, mostly by setting up this new
category of high-priority projects and giving the [Transportation]
secretary so much latitude to determine how the process moves
forward," Lovaas said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's order came a day before a hearing by the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee on the administration's efforts to
streamline environmental reviews for transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   "This executive order is about as clear as a rainy day," said the
committee chairman, Sen. James M. Jeffords, an independent from
Vermont. "It seems to raise more questions than it answers."</TE>

<HD>Eradication of Snakehead Fish in Maryland a Success, Tests
Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CROFTON, Md.</DL>
<LD>Tests show that a breeding population of the voracious northern
snakehead fish has been wiped out and state wildlife officials have
started rehabilitating the pond where the alien invaders were found.</LD>
<LD>   Biologists have found the bodies of six adult snakeheads and more
than 1,000 juveniles since they sprayed the fish poison rotenone on
the 4-acre pond here about two weeks ago. The fish were descendants
of one pair put into the pond two years ago by a man who bought them
in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Electroshock tests showed there were no live fish remaining in the
pond, the Maryland Department of Natural Resource said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   The rotenone was expected to decompose quickly, but rainy weather
lowered the pond's temperature and slowed the process.</TE>
<TE>   DNR spokesman John Surrick said there was no indication that any
snakeheads, natives of China, had escaped from the pond and gotten
into the Little Patuxent River--which is just 75 yards away--or two
adjacent smaller ponds that also were poisoned.</TE>
<TE>   The extreme measures were necessary because scientists feared that
snakeheads, which can wriggle short distances on land, could spread
and devastate the state's ecosystem. Snakeheads can reach 3 feet in
length and they devour smaller fish.</TE>

<HD>A New Fight Brews Over Confederate Battle Flag</HD>
<DH>Protest: Mississippi student vows to stay at county-owned
site until the banner comes down. A public vote on the issue has been
set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULFPORT, Miss.</DL>
<LD>Classes started weeks ago, but Jason Whitfield is staying put on the
beach.</LD>
<LD>   For more than two months, the 21-year-old college student has kept
vigil beneath a fluttering Confederate battle flag he says has no
place being displayed at the county beach here. In his bid to get rid
of it, Whitfield has become a central player in an emotional and
escalating public tussle over the flag--an emblem of Southern
heritage to admirers and a trademark of racist violence to foes.</LD>
<LD>   Whitfield, who is black, and his allies say the battle flag
carries a repugnant symbolism to so many people that it should not
fly over land belonging to all. "Anyone who considers himself a
God-fearing person should stand against this flag," Whitfield said,
sitting on a folding chair near a sign proclaiming Mississippi's Gulf
Coast the "Playground of the South."</LD>
<TE>   Whitfield and others who want to remove the so-called rebel flag,
which was carried onto the Civil War battlefield but was never the
official banner of the Confederacy, have proposed replacing it with
the First National Flag of the Confederate states. The replacement is
less familiar--and less controversial--than the battle flag, but it
would have more historical legitimacy, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The Harrison County Board of Supervisors has voted to keep the
familiar battle flag, red with a blue cross of St. Andrew containing
13 white stars. But in the face of mounting passions since
Whitfield's protest, the supervisors decided this month to put the
matter to a public vote, as a nonbinding referendum, when residents
go to the polls Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Debating the proper place for the Confederate flag is hardly new
in the South. Mississippi voters last year opted to keep the rebel
flag emblem as part of the state flag. But amid the skirmishing here
churns unease among business leaders who fear that the battle flag
sends the wrong image about the modernizing Gulf region just as more
tourists are flocking to the casinos and inns that have flourished
along the white-sand beaches during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve casinos have taken root among budget hotels and majestic
antebellum houses on Beach Boulevard since legalized gaming came to
Harrison County in 1992. The casinos, some built on the sites of
former seafood canneries that were a mainstay of the old economy,
employ at least 16,200 people--more than half of the 30,000 tourism
workers in Gulfport, Biloxi and a handful of other cities.</TE>
<TE>   The beach area has been a resort stop for Southerners since
plantation owners came from elsewhere in the state and nearby
Louisiana more than a century ago. Now a growing number of visitors
is drawn to the state from outside, as is new industry. The rebel
flag in a public display presents an image problem, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really represent the community. The community we live
in is a community of kind and fair people. That rebel flag has an
image across the country of bigotry and racism. And that's not what
we're about," said Aldo Morell, president of the Gulf Coast Economic
Development Council, which last month was joined by the Gulfport
Business Club in asking Harrison County officials to take the flag
down. A third group, the Biloxi Businessmen's Club, opted to sit out
the debate.</TE>
<TE>   William W. Martin, the Board of Supervisors' only black member in
a county that is mostly white, has argued for replacing the battle
flag. But the four supervisors who back the flag said they are
honoring the wishes of constituents for whom the flag remains a link
to forebears who died during the Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're wrong, I'll make the motion and we'll go down there to
the beach the next day and take it down," said Supervisor Bobby
Eleuterius, who said the flag fervor tops anything he has seen during
his 30 years in politics here. Eleuterius pulled out a nearly
2-inch-thick stack of letters and e-mail printouts; all but a few
urged keeping the flag. "I can't go to the grocery store, the
Laundromat or church," he said. "People stop me and say, 'Stand
tall.' "</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield, a business administration major who would have begun
his senior year at Alcorn State University in southwestern
Mississippi, vows to remain as long as the flag does. Since he
planted himself at the base of the flag July 10 with a cooler of ice
and bottled water, Whitfield has prayed considerably, studied the
Bible and the works of Gandhi, and lifted weights. He has eaten food
donated by well-wishers and shrugged off racist epithets shouted by
detractors. He has been the chief topic of on-air conversation at the
radio station where his mother is a producer--causing some to suspect
a publicity stunt--and been written up in the local paper and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield scoffed at suggestions that his sit-in is anything but a
genuine effort to bring down a flag whose use by white-supremacist
groups has made it what he calls "a representation of evil." He said
his protest is spiritual: "I look at this as a chance for people to
choose--a good people versus bad people type thing. There is no
middle ground."</TE>
<TE>   He said the flag could be moved down the street to Beauvoir, the
final home of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. For the Advancement of Colored People has
joined Whitfield and the business groups in seeking to replace the
flag with the First National Flag of the Confederacy, or Stars and
Bars, which has two broad stripes of red and one of white, with a
blue canton containing white stars. Arrayed in opposition are the
county supervisors and groups such as Sons of Confederate Veterans,
which gathered more than 15,000 signatures in support of keeping the
flag in place.</TE>
<TE>   The battle flag is part of a display that includes eight
contemporary American flags, plus the banners of eight
governments--from France and Spain to the state of Mississippi--that
have flown over the region since French explorers first came ashore
at the end of the 17th century. It is in this group that the rebel
flag flies. The display--the only one on county property--was left
over from a former private amusement park.</TE>
<TE>   "We defend our right to honor heritage. We're not honoring
slavery. That flag never flew over slave quarters or a slave ship,"
said Ron Casteel, chief of staff of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.
He said the group, based in Columbia, Tenn., resented the "misuse" of
the banner by racist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the Gulfport flag prompted a lawsuit during the
mid-1990s that ended with a court ruling allowing the county to
continue flying it. The matter flared anew two years ago when the
owner of the station where Whitfield's mother works took the flag
down, leading to demonstrations for and against the symbol. County
officials decided to remove the display and put up tamper-proof
flagpoles. No sooner were the new poles erected last year than the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon occurred. In
support of the anti-terrorism war, the county's supervisors hoisted
only American flags. Then, in July, they voted 4 to 1 to return the
eight historical flags, including the rebel banner.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Whitfield skipped work, grabbed the cooler and a
blanket and assumed his perch. While praying, he said, he decided to
remain, except for a daily trip home to bathe. He is joined by
friends and supporters, who bring food, and by opponents, who plant
rebel flags in the sand on the opposite side of the display. There
has been debate across the divide, and two incidents in which snakes
were released near Whitfield.</TE>
<TE>   Whitfield and his backers are pessimistic about winning the flag
vote. They say the next step could be a call for boycott, such as one
the NAACP has waged with limited success in South Carolina to protest
a Confederate flag on state-government grounds.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Whitfield's schooling will have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll be able to make it back by January," he said. "But if
that flag is still here, I'll still be here."</TE>

<HD>Fla. Asks U.S. for Election Help</HD>
<DH>Politics: The secretary of state says he doesn't want a
repeat of the problems experienced in primary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Florida asked the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday for help in
preventing another election mess in November.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, Florida Secretary of
State Jim Smith said confidence in the state's efforts to reform its
election system was shaken by problems in Miami-Dade and Broward
counties during last week's Democratic primary for governor.</LD>
<LD>   "The fate of election reform in Florida--and perhaps our
nation--rests upon an immediate and effective response," Smith wrote.</LD>
<TE>   In the Democratic primary, Bill McBride narrowly defeated Janet
Reno after a botched election that called to mind the debacle in
Florida during the 2000 White House race.</TE>
<TE>   The balloting this time was beset with equipment failures and
human errors despite a $32-million overhaul of the election system to
get rid of punch-card ballots and install touch-screen voting
machines.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, Florida's top election official, said the state is
reviewing the problems and asked Ashcroft to "take whatever steps you
deem necessary to participate in this review." He also asked the
Justice Department to assist election supervisors in ensuring a
smooth general election.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, sent Ashcroft a letter
supporting Smith's request.</TE>
<TE>   The problems were particularly bad in Broward and Miami-Dade
counties. Smith blamed lack of county poll worker training, a failure
to practice using the new voting systems and poor organization.</TE>
<TE>   Florida voting is a sensitive matter at the White House, which
President Bush captured after a disputed election victory over
Democrat Al Gore in which some Florida votes were not recorded
because, among other things, ballot cards were not punched all the
way through.</TE>

<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>A man who killed a fellow student at Texas A&amp;M University while
burglarizing her home in 1994 was executed by lethal injection
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ron Shamburger, 30, was the second person in two days and the 26th
person this year put to death in Texas, which leads the nation in
capital punishment.</LD>
<LD>   He was condemned for murdering Lori Baker, 20, after he broke into
her College Station, Texas, home on Sept. 30, 1994, to steal money.</LD>
<TE>   Baker, who months before had gone dancing with Shamburger, awoke
to find him in her bedroom, so he shot her in the head.</TE>
<TE>   He then used a knife to try to remove the bullet from her head and
when he could not find it, poured gasoline over her body and set it
on fire.</TE>
<TE>   In a final statement while strapped to a gurney in the Texas death
chamber, Shamburger quoted extensively from the Bible and apologized
to Baker's family, several members of whom witnessed the execution.</TE>
<TE>   Shamburger's parents also witnessed the execution and he
apologized to them, saying: "Forgive me. Thank you for your love."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>A woman sued Gov. Paul E. Patton for sexual harassment Wednesday and
claimed he directed state regulators toward her nursing home in
retaliation for her ending their alleged two-year affair.</LD>
<LD>   The Democratic governor held a news conference earlier to deny
Tina Conner's claims. The state Cabinet for Human Services also said
its actions against the nursing home were not influenced by Patton or
his office.</LD>
<LD>   "In time I expect that the full truth will come out," Patton said.
"I think my conduct has been appropriate."</LD>
<TE>   Judi Patton stood by her husband of 25 years at the news
conference. The governor did not discuss many of the allegations but
said he would fight any lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Conner's lawsuit names Patton and the state of Kentucky as
defendants and seeks unspecified damages. It alleges sexual
harassment, retaliation and intentional infliction of emotional
distress.</TE>
<TE>   Conner's attorney, Fred Radolovich, said his client believes her
life has been ruined.</TE>

<HD>Despite Own Views, Nominee Would Back 'Roe'</HD>
<DH>Court: The judicial hopeful defends his writings on
abortion ruling. He says he would 'respect' the law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>University of Utah law professor Michael W. McConnell, nominated by
President Bush for a seat on the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals,
criticized the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade opinion on abortion as
poorly reasoned and unconvincing, but he assured senators Wednesday
that he views it as "well-settled law" that he would enforce fairly
and firmly.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot has happened" since 1973, when the Supreme Court announced
that women have a constitutional right to choose abortion, McConnell
told the Senate Judiciary Committee.</LD>
<LD>   Although controversial still, the abortion right "has been
considered and reaffirmed" by the high court in 1992, with the
support of justices appointed by presidents Reagan and George Bush,
he said.</LD>
<TE>   "It is also much more reflective of the consensus of the American
people," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is settled, as settled as any issue can be in
constitutional law."</TE>
<TE>   McConnell, 47, is the latest of Bush's judicial nominees to face
sharp attacks from liberal activists and abortion-rights advocates,
who contend that his conservative views and strong personal and legal
opposition to abortion make him ill-suited to be a federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   But McConnell is a highly regarded constitutional scholar, and
more than 300 law professors, many of them prominent liberals, have
endorsed him.</TE>
<TE>   Bush nominated him last year to the appeals court, which is based
in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   The vote on sending McConnell's nomination to the full Senate is
expected before Congress takes a break for the November elections.
The committee rejected two of Bush's high-profile conservative
nominees for appellate court seats, Texas Supreme Court Justice
Priscilla Owen and U.S. District Judge Charles W. Pickering of
Mississippi, earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   In Wednesday's rather low-key hearing, McConnell both defended his
past comments and sought to defuse the issue by stressing the
difference between a law professor's writings and a judge's rulings.</TE>
<TE>   Academics get credit for being "provocative" in their writings, he
said. They are encouraged to offer new ways of looking at old
controversies.</TE>
<TE>   "We all do that in my line of work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In one such example, McConnell called the Roe vs. Wade ruling an
"embarrassment" because it was not based on the Constitution's words
or the court's precedents.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to explain that comment, McConnell said he was not alone in
questioning the reasoning and logic of the 1973 decision that struck
down all of the state laws banning abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "Among legal scholars, criticism of Roe is quite common,"
McConnell said, even among those who believe women should have such a
choice.</TE>
<TE>   The 14th Amendment says, "No State shall ... deprive any person of
... liberty ... without due process of law."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, this clause was seen as a guarantee that people would
not be sent to jail without a fair trial. But the Supreme Court in
the 1960s said that the concept of liberty included a "right to
privacy." In the Roe vs. Wade ruling, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said
for a 7-2 majority that this right to privacy "is broad enough to
encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her
pregnancy."</TE>
<TE>   McConnell said focus on privacy was "unsatisfactory" in the view
of many because it did not take into account "the claim of another
being on the other side of the equation."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he said his job as a judge would be to enforce
constitutional decisions of the high court, without regard to his
personal or moral views.</TE>
<TE>   "As a judge, I will respect and enforce the law fairly and
even-handedly," he said. "I am absolutely committed to that.... I
have no hesitation about enforcing" the right to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Several senators, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick
J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.) and
John Edwards (D-N.C.), pressed McConnell to explain his views on the
abortion issue, but none indicated opposition to the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   Nan Aron, president of the Alliance for Justice, a consortium of
liberal activist groups, said the senators should reject the nominee
based on his past writings. "He is asking them to take on faith his
ability to be open-minded and to follow the rule of law in the face
of decades of writings that show a hostility to these established
rights. It's too great a risk to take," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the focus on abortion Wednesday, McConnell is best-known
in legal circles for his work on religious freedom. He has argued in
the Supreme Court in favor of allowing parochial schools to receive
certain types of government aid on the same basis as private and
public schools.</TE>
<TE>   However, he also has opposed a return to school-sponsored prayers.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal law professors who know and endorse McConnell say he has
not been a predictable supporter of other conservative causes.</TE>
<TE>   He opposed the impeachment of President Clinton and faulted the
Supreme Court for stopping the Florida recount in the Bush vs. Gore
case. He has also criticized the court's conservative majority for
cutting back on Congress' power to enforce civil rights.</TE>

<HD>Traffic Charge Voided Against Muslim</HD>
<DH>Florida: The man was one of three medical students
questioned in a false-alarm terror case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Police dismissed a traffic citation against one of three Muslim
medical students interrogated as terrorist suspects in a false alarm
last week, the men's lawyer said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Collier County Sheriff's deputies issued a ticket Friday to one of
the three, Kambiz Butt, charging that he failed to pay a toll on
Alligator Alley, the main east-west highway through the Everglades.</LD>
<LD>   The men's lawyer, David Kubiliun, said Collier Sheriff Don Hunter
notified him Wednesday that authorities had voided the ticket after
reviewing a videotape that showed him paying the toll.</LD>
<TE>   "It's conclusive that Mr. Butt did not run that toll plaza,"
Kubiliun said. "This is just further evidence that the young men have
been telling the truth all along.</TE>
<TE>   "This is certainly a very positive sign."</TE>
<TE>   A sheriff's dispatcher could not immediately comment late
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Butt and two companions, Omer Choudhary and Ayman Gheith, were
stopped on the Florida highway after a woman told police she
overheard them in a Georgia restaurant talking about what she thought
was a plot against Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Florida police stopped the men near the toll plaza and closed the
highway for more than 14 hours while questioning them and searching
their cars for explosives. They found nothing suspicious and released
them, calling the incident a false alarm.</TE>
<TE>   The trio are third-year medical students at Ross University in
Dominica and have insisted that they did nothing wrong. They were
traveling to Florida to begin clinical training Monday at Larkin
Community Hospital in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Their internships were canceled after the hospital received a
barrage of threats, and Ross University was still working to find
somewhere else for them to train, Kubiliun said.</TE>
<TE>   Choudhary and Gheith were born in the United States and Butt is a
U.S. citizen born in Iran. Kubiliun is representing them at the
request of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which said the
three were victims of prejudice against Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred during a heightened state of alert
surrounding the Sept. 11 anniversary of last year's attacks.</TE>

<HD>Conn. Files to Bar Skakel Bail</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>State prosecutors filed a motion Wednesday opposing another attempt
by lawyers of Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel to get him freed on bond
during an appeal of his murder conviction.</LD>
<LD>   After Skakel was sentenced last month to 20 years to life for the
1975 beating death of Martha Moxley, his defense team requested that
he be released on bond while his appeal was pending.</LD>
<LD>   Judge John F. Kavanewsky Jr. denied that request, and Skakel's
defense team filed a motion for review of the denial.</LD>
<TE>   The state filed a motion Wednesday opposing the latest request.</TE>
<TE>   The state said it agrees with Kavanewsky that the terms of
Skakel's appeal are governed by the current state law, and not the
law that was in effect when Moxley was killed.</TE>
<TE>   The law now does not allow a convicted murderer to be freed on
bond during an appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel was convicted June 7.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUFFALO, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A bail hearing for five U.S. citizens of Yemeni descent alleged to be
Al Qaeda supporters was adjourned without a ruling Wednesday after
federal prosecutors argued that their crime was one of violence and
they should be denied bail.</LD>
<LD>   The five men--Yasein Taher, 24; Faysal Galab, 26; Sahim Alwan, 29;
Yahya Goba, 25; and Shafal Mosed, 24--are all charged with providing
"material support" to Al Qaeda, the militant Islamic network led by
Saudi-born Osama bin Laden that the U.S. blames for last year's
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</LD>
<LD>   Although the men had no direct connection to the attacks,
investigators allege they were trained to use assault rifles and
other weapons at an Al Qaeda-run camp in Afghanistan in the spring
and summer of 2001, before the Sept. 11 attacks that killed more than
3,000 people.</LD>
<TE>   The charges of providing, attempting to provide and conspiring to
provide material support to a foreign terrorist group carry a maximum
penalty of 15 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a crime of violence," Assistant U.S. Atty. William Hochul
argued, adding that the defendants should be denied bail because they
"pose a threat of flight."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys for the men, all residents of a small Yemeni
community in the faded steel town of Lackawanna, N.Y., near Buffalo,
were expected to present their arguments today.</TE>
<TE>   They have said the five are innocent and presented motions
Wednesday to have the case dismissed and the men freed.</TE>
<TE>   Hochul requested 10 days to reply to the motions.</TE>
<TE>   Federal magistrate H. Kenneth Schroeder indicated that he would
not rule from the bench on whether to grant the men bail, but instead
would issue a ruling after considering the arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "I will attempt to balance all of the rights: the rights of the
community to be safe and the rights of the defendants who are
presumed to be innocent," Schroeder said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my intention to put the government to the test."</TE>
<TE>   While in Afghanistan, the five allegedly were lectured on holy war
and the use of suicide as a weapon, investigators said.</TE>

<HD>Agriculture Secretary Says She Has Treatable Breast Cancer</HD>
<DH>Health: Veneman says the disease was caught in early stages
and she plans to begin therapy this week. Bush hails his Cabinet
member as a hero.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman said Wednesday she has an early
form of breast cancer and will begin treatment this week. At a White
House gathering of cancer survivors, President Bush praised her as a
hero and said, "We can stop cancer in its tracks."</LD>
<LD>   Veneman said she intends to stay on as secretary, though her
treatments are expected to last several weeks.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm fine. I mean, I'm more fine now than I will be when I start
the treatment, because then you have to go through all of that. But
I'm doing OK," Veneman said. "It's hard news to get, but obviously,
it's very early and I'm very thankful for that."</LD>
<TE>   Veneman, 53, said she would be unable to travel for several weeks
but that it should not affect department operations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is 98% curable and my doctors expect a complete recovery
following treatment," she wrote department employees.</TE>
<TE>   Treatments will include a lumpectomy, a breast-saving type of
cancer surgery in which only the lump is removed, followed by six
weeks of radiation therapy, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Veneman identified the cancer as "ductal carcinoma in situ," tiny
tumors that are not invasive cancer and do not always become
life-threatening. She credited a mammogram with catching the disease
early.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I picked an extraordinary person when I named her to run
the Department of Agriculture," Bush said in an East Room ceremony in
which he offered a progress report on the fight against cancer. "I
didn't realize I was going to pick a heroic figure as well, an
example for many people to understand the need to get a mammogram,
the need to take care of yourself, the need to screen early, the need
to understand that we can stop cancer in its tracks if we all take
wise moves."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said more than 60% of those diagnosed with cancer today can
expect to be alive in five years. Five-year survival rates for
testicular cancer have reached 95%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, 8.9 million Americans are cancer survivors, and research
and new technology offer hope, offer a lot of hope that this number
will continue to grow significantly," he said. "There are still many
high medical hurdles that we're going to have to clear here in
America, but for the first time in human history, we can say with
certainty the war on cancer is winnable."</TE>
<TE>   But more than 1,500 Americans die from cancer every day, he said.
Cancer survivor and four-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong,
who turned 31 Wednesday, said that meant "a tragedy like 9/11 is
every two days of this illness." Bush said his proposed 2003 budget
would increase funds for cancer research by $629 million, bringing
spending on cancer research throughout the National Institutes of
Health to more than $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong, who survived testicular cancer that spread to his lungs
and brain, told Bush: "This fight has got to be one of our biggest
priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Looking around the stage at half a dozen people who have lived
through cancer, Armstrong added, "We need more survivors up here."</TE>

<HD>Step by Step, Bloody Tale of Maya Conquest</HD>
<DH>Science: Newly found glyphs on a stairway indicate ruler of
a third city was behind a 'world war' long thought a rivalry of two
brothers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hieroglyphic stairway exposed last fall by a hurricane at the Maya
city of Dos Pilas tells the story of the brutal and bloody war
between two superpowers that were trying to dominate their known
world.</LD>
<LD>   A new translation of the epic tale fills a vital 60-year gap in
Maya history during a period that set the stage for the ultimate
collapse of the Maya civilization.</LD>
<LD>   The leaders of the Maya cities of Tikal and Dos Pilas were
brothers, and historians have long believed that rivalry between them
was at the root of conflict between the two cities. But the newly
discovered inscriptions indicate that it was a third party--Calakmul,
in what is now Mexico--that triggered the fighting in its attempts to
conquer the Maya empire.</LD>
<TE>   "This carries back our history of the dynasty [at Dos Pilas]
another 40 to 50 years and changes our entire interpretation of this
region," said archeologist Arthur Demarest of Vanderbilt University.
"This was not part of a dynastic struggle between two brothers, but
part of a world war."</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists "are fascinated by the possibility that the Maya
were trying to create an empire, but were having difficulty making it
work," added archeologist David Friedel of Southern Methodist
University. "We now know that the reason they were having difficulty
... was because there were two great contending rivals for overlord
in this period" and neither was able to achieve a definitive success.</TE>
<TE>   Dos Pilas is deep in the Guatemalan jungle near the Pasion River,
which was the superhighway of the Maya world. Many facts about the
city have intrigued archeologists, posing puzzles that had no clear
solutions. The city seemed to have sprung up nearly overnight,
reaching a population of nearly 5,000. Yet soils in the region are
very poor, and there was little or no evidence of farming to support
the city. It was not clear how and why it was established.</TE>
<TE>   The new discovery, published in the October edition of the
National Geographic magazine, seems to clear up many of those
questions.</TE>
<TE>   Several large hurricanes, including Iris, struck the region last
fall, and no one knows which exposed the steps. Demarest got a call
from one of his sources telling him about the newly exposed steps
and, fearing looting or other damage, immediately organized an
expedition to document the finding--borrowing money on his MasterCard
to speed the process. Ultimately, the project was financed by
Vanderbilt, the National Geographic Society and the Foundation for
Mesoamerican Studies. Federico Fahsen of Vanderbilt, a noted Maya
epigrapher, did most of the actual excavation and translation.</TE>
<TE>   The steps themselves "are in beautiful shape," Demarest said.
"Some parts look like they were carved yesterday." The team
photographed them, made replicas and built roofs and other structures
to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   As Fahsen was translating the hieroglyphs, he was astonished by
what they said. "When I read those glyphs, I had to blink to make
sure I was reading them correctly," he said. "I had never heard of
Calakmul actually invading and defeating the king of Dos Pilas. We
thought that, at most, they may have had a weak alliance of some
type."</TE>
<TE>   The glyphs tell of the birth of a king, Balaj Chan K'awiil, on
Oct. 15, AD 625, in Tikal. Four years later, Balaj Chan K'awiil was
sent with a military force to establish the city of Dos Pilas, about
70 miles southwest of Tikal. A stronghold in Dos Pilas allowed Tikal
to exert control over the Pasion River, the major trade route between
the highlands and lowlands for coveted items such as jade, obsidian,
quetzal feathers and shells from the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   "Balaj Chan K'awiil became a very big warrior," Fahsen said. "He
almost never stopped fighting and for many years was loyal to Tikal."</TE>
<TE>   The steps tell about the ceremonies that the young man went
through, always as a friend of his brother, Nuun Ujol Chaak, the
ruler of Tikal--not as an enemy as was previously believed.</TE>
<TE>   The fly in the ointment was a ruler commonly known as Yuknom Cheen
the Great, who was the leader of a group of people who called
themselves the Kan, the "snake people." His capital was Calakmul, in
what is now Campeche state in southeastern Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   When Balaj Chan K'awiil was in his early 20s, Calakmul attacked
and defeated Dos Pilas. He was captured, but subsequently restored to
the throne as a "puppet king" who was allowed to keep his land in
exchange for allegiance to the invader.</TE>
<TE>   The record then describes how Balaj Chan K'awiil launched a
decade-long war against Tikal that ended in his victory. His forces
sacked Tikal and brought Nuun Ujol Chaak--his own brother--and other
Tikal nobles to Dos Pilas to be sacrificed.</TE>
<TE>   This section of the glyphs "was very graphic," Fahsen noted: "It
says, 'Blood flowed and skulls of the 13 peoples of the Tikal palace
were piled up.' The final glyphs describe the king of Dos Pilas
'doing a victory dance.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dos Pilas then embarked on a campaign of conquest and became a
major regional power.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings appear to support the theory previously advanced
by Maya scholars Simon Martin of University College, London and
Nikolai Grube of the University of Bonn that this period in Maya
history was a "long world war" between the superpowers of Tikal and
Calakmul. Neither gained ultimate ascendancy, and power oscillated
back and forth.</TE>
<TE>   "After Tikal was sacked, it eventually roared back and crushed
Calakmul," Demarest said. "And then the Maya world just broke up into
regional powers, setting the stage for a period of intensive, petty
warfare that finally led to the collapse of the Maya."</TE>
<TE>   By AD 760, Dos Pilas had been abandoned. And by the 9th century,
the entire western Maya civilization had disintegrated.</TE>

<HD>Weaver Gets Yankees Closer to East Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Weaver gives the New York Yankees a great luxury.</LD>
<LD>   Weaver pitched 7 2/3 strong innings in place of the ill David
Wells, and Alfonso Soriano picked up his 200th hit of the season to
help the Yankees defeat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 7-1, Wednesday
night at St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Giambi hit his 38th homer for the Yankees, who cut their
magic number to two for clinching their fifth consecutive American
League East title.</LD>
<TE>   Weaver (10-11) gave up one run and six hits. Acquired from Detroit
in a three-team trade July 5, Weaver has been used as a reliever by
the pitching-rich Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an insurance policy for us," Manager Joe Torre said. "One
thing about him, he throws strikes. His whole approach of attacking
the strike zone put the hitters on the defensive."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver threw 64 of 99 pitches for strikes in his first outing in
eight days.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the opportunities that allow something to happen,"
Weaver said. "The same thing could happen in the postseason, and I
need to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Wells was scratched because of a stomach virus and was examined at
the ballpark. He might pitch late this week or early next week.</TE>
<TE>   Jared Sandberg hit a homer for Tampa Bay, which has lost 11 of 14
against the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the Weaver that I've seen on TV for the past couple of
years," Sandberg said. "Dominating sinkerball pitcher, got the
groundballs and spun the curveball when he needed to."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Zambrano (6-8) gave up four runs and five hits in five
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano had a run-scoring single during a two-run third that put
the Yankees ahead, 2-0. He later stole his 41st base.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi hit a solo homer and Juan Rivera, bidding for postseason
playing time in left field, had a run-scoring single in the fourth
that made it 4-0. Rivera went three for four.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano's run-scoring single in the sixth put New York ahead, 5-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays became the last AL team to reach the 1-million mark
in home attendance with the announced crowd of 14,993.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 2, Detroit 0--Joe Mays (4-7) gave up three hits in six
innings at Detroit, and Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his
team-record 43rd save. Mays is 7-0 in his last nine starts against
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota scored on Matthew LeCroy's single in the first and Luis
Rivas' double in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Boston 4--Pinch-hitter Earl Snyder reached on one
error and scored on another to break an eighth-inning tie at Boston,
where the Indians rallied from a 4-0 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland took advantage of four errors to score twice in the
seventh and three times in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Baltimore 1--Roy Halladay (17-7) gave up seven hits in
seven shutout innings, and Carlos Delgado homered to lead the Blue
Jays at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's Mike Bordick extended his run of errorless games to
100, one short of Rey Ordonez's major league record for shortstops.</TE>
<TE>   Kelvim Escobar got his 35th save.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, Kansas City 1--Frank Thomas homered for the second
consecutive game for the host White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Olivo, playing in his second major league game, drove in
the go-ahead run with a bases-loaded walk. The White Sox have won
five of six games.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Garland (12-11) gave up one run and three hits in 5 1/3
innings. Jeff Suppan (8-16) lost his ninth consecutive decision.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Tejada Has Had His Fill of Washburn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>If the Angels face the Oakland Athletics in the American League
championship series, here's a statistic to remember: Miguel Tejada,
the engine in the Oakland offense and a leading candidate for most
valuable player, is one for 30 against Angel ace Jarrod Washburn.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to face him again this year," Tejada said Wednesday.
"I'd rather wait for next year."</LD>
<LD>   Washburn pitched eight shutout innings Tuesday, holding Tejada
hitless.</LD>
<TE>   "For me, he looked like the Cy Young pitcher. He's that good,"
Tejada said. "He gets me out with fastballs, and I'm a fastball
hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Tejada said he would vote for teammate Barry Zito for Cy Young but
said he considered Washburn in the same class. In turn, Washburn said
he would vote for teammate Garret Anderson for MVP but otherwise
would favor Tejada over Texas shortstop Alex Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "All the talk about A-Rod, I don't buy that," Washburn said. "The
most valuable player should go to the most valuable player, not the
best player. They're in last place. Take him off the team, and
they're still in last place."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, who rarely throws anything besides a fastball, said he
was "baffled" by his success against Tejada.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wondered about that," Washburn said. "He's a great
fastball hitter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn didn't do much for the Angels' attendance during the
three years he played in Anaheim, but the Angels are counting on him
to help draw fans to Edison Field next year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative 2003 schedule, Vaughn and the New York Mets
will visit Anaheim for an interleague series. The Angels, facing the
National League East in interleague play next year, also are
scheduled to welcome the Philadelphia Phillies to Anaheim and play at
Florida and at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are delighted with the home schedule, which features
the series against the Mets, the now-traditional series against the
Dodgers and two series rather than one against the New York Yankees.
The Angels hope that the attractive schedule, combined with the
momentum of a playoff appearance this season, can boost attendance
next season toward 2.5 million, a total hit just once since 1990.
With three home games left this season, the Angels will finish close
to 2.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have eight scouts on the road, preparing reports on
possible AL playoff opponents. They'll later assign some of those
scouts to NL playoff teams in preparation for a potential World
Series.... The MVP ballot extends to 10 names, and Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia lobbied not only for Anderson but for shortstop David
Eckstein. "If you don't have Eck in the top 10, you're looking in the
wrong league," Scioscia said.... Since the All-Star break, the
Yankees' Bernie Williams leads the league with a .358 batting
average, with Adam Kennedy of the Angels at .357.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Lo Duca Ignores Slide Rule</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most players who slide or dive on the rubber-like surface ringing
Dodger Stadium land with a sudden thud, the impact often resulting in
some kind of knee-jarring, hamstring-straining or ankle-twisting
injury.</LD>
<LD>   But when Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca sprinted toward the
third-base dugout and made a spectacular sliding catch of Bill
Mueller's seventh-inning popup Tuesday night, he slid right off the
warning track, four big steps down to the floor of the Dodger dugout
and landed on his feet, popping back onto the field with cat-like
quickness.</LD>
<LD>   "That's from my pop-and-lock days, when I used to break-dance on a
cardboard box in the mall," Lo Duca said. "I've seen a lot of guys
blow out on that rubber stuff. I was lucky because I slid. It was
almost like being at Wet 'N Wild."</LD>
<TE>   Adding to the degree of difficulty of Lo Duca's catch was the
uncertainty of the landing. Dodger pitcher Andy Ashby was in the
vicinity but didn't try to catch Lo Duca, which was fortunate. Lo
Duca might have broken Ashby's leg had he hit him.</TE>
<TE>   "With the momentum I had, I might have killed somebody in the
dugout," Lo Duca said. "I was lucky. Any more momentum, I would have
hit my head on the bench. Any less momentum, I would have hit the
steps. It was fun, though."</TE>
<TE>   It takes a certain type of mentality to make such a catch, a guy
who "has no regard for his body," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He went
into the dugout not knowing what the outcome would be. All he knew
was it was a one-run game and he had to catch that ball."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca said he was "a little sore" Wednesday but had no regrets.
He simply knows no other way to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always played sort of kamikaze," Lo Duca said. "I'll
probably kill myself one of these days and learn my lesson. But it
was probably one of the best plays I've ever made."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To pitch or not to pitch to Barry Bonds? The Dodgers pitched to
him with runners on first and third in the second inning of Tuesday
night's 6-4 loss to the Giants and got burned when Bonds hit a
two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers walked Bonds in the first and fourth innings, and both
times, Benito Santiago followed with hits, an RBI single in the first
and a double in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want Bonds to beat us, but I don't look at him as the
major reason we lost [Tuesday night]," Tracy said. "In order to
manipulate Barry Bonds like you want, you have to have success
against the rest of the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "Take Barry out of the equation, and you have a second baseman
[Jeff Kent] with 35 homers, a third baseman [David Bell] with 20
homers, a shortstop [Rich Aurilia] with 13 homers, a right fielder
[Reggie Sanders] with 19 homers and an All-Star catcher [Santiago].
Barry can be a one-man wrecking crew, but he's not a one-man team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santiago received a two-game suspension Wednesday for bumping
umpire Mark Hirschbeck during an argument in the ninth inning of
Sunday's game against San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago appealed the suspension, which allowed him to play
Wednesday, and he'll probably play in tonight's series finale against
the Dodgers. But the commissioner's office is expected to rule within
a day or two on the appeal, and if the suspension is upheld, Santiago
will sit out two games this weekend in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii returned to Dodger Stadium on Wednesday
for the first time since suffering a season-ending fractured skull
when he was hit by a Brian Hunter line drive Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to see a smile on his face, especially after what we
witnessed two Sundays ago," Tracy said. "It was very uplifting for
all of us, a breath of fresh air."</TE>

finger of his pitching hand, but the condition is not expected to
affect the left-hander tonight. Hernandez has a 5-8 career record and
4.49 ERA against the Dodgers, but the right-hander gave up three runs
on six hits in seven innings of a 6-5 win over the Dodgers on Sept. 9
and is 2-1 with a 2.78 ERA in three starts against them this season.</TE>

<HD>Rest Could Be History for Nomo</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Tracy thinking of using his top starter more often
than usual down stretch in wild-card race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Out of viable options and running out of time, the Dodgers might need
an even bigger boost from Hideo Nomo in the final days of an intense
National League wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   With the rotation in tatters and Nomo willing, Manager Jim Tracy
said Wednesday he is strongly considering using Nomo twice on three
days' rest in the final week of the season.</LD>
<LD>   "We can do anything we want with Nomo," Tracy said before
Wednesday's game. "There's 11 games left and there's one game
separating the [Dodgers and Giants] for the final playoff spot."</LD>
<TE>   Odalis Perez is scheduled to start the final game of a four-game
showdown with the San Francisco Giants tonight at Dodger Stadium, and
Andy Ashby the opener of a three-game series against the San Diego
Padres at Qualcomm Stadium. Nomo and Omar Daal are set to start the
last two games against San Diego and the club is off Monday, which
would enable Tracy and pitching coach Jim Colborn to make changes.</TE>
<TE>   Using Perez on short rest is a possibility, or the Dodgers could
turn to a reliever for a start or leave Kevin Beirne in the rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy and Colborn would prefer to keep Nomo on his regular
schedule, but desperate times call for desperate measures. And these
are desperate times for the Dodger rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhisa Ishii is sidelined for the remainder of the season after
being struck with a line drive and having a titanium plate inserted
into his head, Kevin Brown is out with back problems and Daal and
Ashby have been pounded in their last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   No one needs to tell Tracy, who knows what the Dodgers are facing
and what Nomo can do.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be some things entertained that seem outlandish, but
you have to ask yourself, 'What are your choices?' " Tracy said.
"I'll entertain anything that makes sense and doesn't risk injury."</TE>
<TE>   Having Nomo work on short rest seemingly doesn't make sense.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-year veteran has thrown the most pitches of any starter
on the Dodgers and is ninth in the NL with 3,254. Nomo has thrown at
least 120 pitches four times, including 367 in his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   That's taxing work for anyone, and fatigue is a concern at this
time of year for pitchers working on normal rest, but the Dodgers
believe Nomo would do just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "He seems to pitch better when he throws more," Colborn said. "If
it comes down to the last day of the season, you take your best
option, and Nomo on three days may be our best option. In his case
more than anyone else that wouldn't be a concern."</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's 7-6 victory, Nomo (15-6, 3.32 earned-run average) gave
up three runs in the first three innings and threw 70 pitches. He
limited the Giants to one hit and no runs in his final three innings.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander had a similar performance Sept. 11 at Pacific
Bell Park, throwing 73 pitches in three innings and giving up two
runs on six hits. The Giants were hitless during Nomo's final 3 2/3
innings in a 7-3 Dodger victory.</TE>
<TE>   While pitching for the Detroit Tigers in 2000, Nomo pitched a
scoreless inning in relief against the Cleveland Indians three days
after giving up eight hits and seven runs in eight innings against
the Toronto Blue Jays. He started three days later against the New
York Yankees, giving up nine hits and three runs in 5 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "Nomo has been great for us all year," right fielder Shawn Green
said. "You know you can count on him every time he goes out there,
and that's all you can ask for."</TE>

<LD>It's still as important as a sunrise to the South and definitely
pivotal pigskin in terms of the Southeastern Conference East Division
race, but No. 10 Florida at No. 4 Tennessee this week without Steve
Spurrier feels like "The Three Tenors" at the Hollywood Bowl without
Pavarotti.</LD>
<LD>   As Tony Soprano might say, "Whaddayagonna do?"</LD>
<LD>   Spurrier has taken his ball plays and flapping lips to the
NFL--we're guessing he'd rather have played Vanderbilt last Monday
night instead of Philadelphia--depriving the college game its annual
three-ringed football circus and sideline sideshow.</LD>
<TE>   No one poked, prodded and psychologically tormented Tennessee more
than Spurrier, who went 7-3 against Volunteer Coach Phillip Fulmer
and never failed to remind us.</TE>
<TE>   "He could annoy you from time to time," Fulmer confessed Wednesday
on his weekly conference call. "Whether it was intentional or
planned, I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Would you believe intentional and planned?</TE>
<TE>   Florida whipped Tennessee five consecutive years at one stretch in
the 1990s and likely deprived Volunteer quarterback Peyton Manning
the Heisman Trophy in 1996 and '97. Manning was winless in three
games against the Gators.</TE>
<TE>   It was Spurrier who suggested Manning returned to Tennessee for
his senior season to lead his team to another Citrus Bowl, Spurrier
who liked to call Tennessee the "Knox County Champions" and Spurrier
who said you couldn't spell Citrus Bowl without "UT."</TE>
<TE>   With Spurrier manning the microphone, Fulmer sometimes came off
nationally as a whistle-blowing Elmer Fudd.</TE>
<TE>   The irony is Spurrier's superior national appeal eclipsed the
extraordinary and parallel achievements of another SEC school and
coach: Tennessee and Fulmer.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 years since the SEC split into six-team divisions, only
two schools have won the East Division: Florida or Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 seasons as SEC contemporaries, Fulmer won as many
national titles as Spurrier, one, and boasted the better winning
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   You read it right. Spurrier's 122-27-1 record in 12 years at
Florida worked out to a percentage of .817, while Fulmer's 10-year
record of 95-20 entering play this year is .826.</TE>
<TE>   Fulmer was even gaining ground in his personal battle, splitting
the last four games against Spurrier's Gators.</TE>
<TE>   Fulmer, though, was never going to match his adversary in the war
of words.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve had a very dominant type of personality," Fulmer said. "I
guess he was the media-friendly type of guy. We just tried to go
about our business here and be ourselves. I don't feel like I felt
dominated by him, but certainly he demanded a lot of attention."</TE>
<TE>   With Spurrier gone, and Florida floundering a bit already in the
first days of first-year Coach Ron Zook, you'd think this is
Tennessee's time to make up for lost headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, the mild-mannered Fulmer doesn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really concern myself with that," he said. "I do think we
get very good national attention, at least from the people who are
important, and that's the fans and the prospects. We've done OK."</TE>
<TE>   Fulmer says he never disliked Spurrier and acknowledged the
coaches' wives are friends.</TE>
<TE>   Professionally, Spurrier's success no doubt pushed Fulmer to
heights he might otherwise never have reached.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be, I guess, an admirer of what he was able to do
while he was in the conference and respect that," Fulmer said of the
former Florida coach. "He had a tremendous amount of success and
deserves his due from that standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Now, perhaps, Fulmer will reach his due point.</TE>
<TE>   Not Yet in Bloom</TE>
<TE>   Colorado freshman receiver Jeremy Bloom returned to practice this
week and hopes to play against UCLA after a toe injury forced him to
miss last week's USC game.</TE>
<TE>   Bloom has yet to catch a pass but did return a punt 75 yards for a
touchdown in the opener against Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   Bloom made national headlines last month when he was forced to
choose football over skiing after the NCAA refused his request to
allow him to keep endorsement money earned as a star on the World Cup
freestyle circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Bloom postponed his football career last year so he could compete
in the Salt Lake City Olympics. He finished ninth in freestyle moguls
but went on to win the World Cup title in his event.</TE>
<TE>   Bloom was torn between his love of two sports. Collegiate athletes
are allowed to maintain their amateur status in one sport and play
professionally in another, but are not allowed to accept endorsement
money. In World Cup skiing, however, endorsement money is critical to
subsidizing one's career.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed recently in Boulder, Bloom said his "ski career is in
jeopardy" and that he remained displeased with the NCAA's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel so helpless," Bloom said. "There were two things I
wanted to do when I was little, play football and ski in the
Olympics. I never thought an organization would take that away from
me."</TE>
<TE>   Bloom's rise as a freestyle moguls skier was remarkable given he
started the year on the "C" team.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a nobody in skiing last year," he said. "I didn't have a
World Cup ranking. I was begging to get some financial support
through endorsements. Then, my dream comes true, I end my season
ranked No. 1 in the world, it's time to capitalize on it, sign new
contracts and get money to fund better training. And the second I do
that, all those doors are shut. And that's an uneasy feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Bloom, although only 5 feet 9 and 165 pounds, is no joke as a
player. He was a star receiver at Loveland (Colo.) High and offered a
full scholarship by Coach Gary Barnett.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh no, he can play," Barnett said. "We had him in camp a year
ago, so we knew he was a player."</TE>
<TE>   As for Bloom's ski career?</TE>
<TE>   Don St. Pierre, the United States ski team's moguls coach, said
this week Bloom could have been as big a star in freestyle skiing as
Jonny Mosley.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt," St. Pierre said. "He has the personality to do
whatever he wants."</TE>
<TE>   St. Pierre says if Bloom can avoid injuries, he could feasibly
compete at this year's World Championships in January if it could be
worked out with the Colorado football team.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only get up in the day and take so many risks, but Jeremy
seems to walk on water," St. Pierre said. "He's one hell of a
talent."</TE>
<TE>   If Bloom sticks with football, St. Pierre doubts the skier could
compete at the 2006 Olympics in Torino, Italy. St. Pierre says the
technology is changing too fast.</TE>
<TE>   "The further he gets engrossed with football, I think that would
be a stretch," St. Pierre said of 2006 Olympic plans.</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   Welcome back to the big leagues, USC (2-0), Penn State (2-0) and
Notre Dame (3-0). These fabled programs, with a combined 15 national
titles since the AP began polling in 1936, are coming off non-winning
seasons. The last of the Big Three to win a national title was Notre
Dame in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The question: How long can this last? If Notre Dame can break a
five-game losing streak against Michigan State this week, the Irish
then face Stanford, Pittsburgh and Air Force, giving them a
legitimate shot at being 7-0 when they play at Florida State on Oct.
26. USC still faces a strength-of-schedule quagmire; the record of
the Trojans' remaining opponents is 24-4. Penn State still has to
play at Wisconsin, at Michigan and at Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   How can California (3-0) not crack this week's coaches' poll while
Michigan State is still receiving votes? The coaches' poll does not
recognize schools that are on NCAA probation. The Associated Press
poll has no such policy, which is why Cal made its debut this week at
No. 23.</TE>
<TE>   The anticipated comeback of Neil Parry, the San Jose State player
who had his right leg amputated below the knee after an injury
suffered in a game two years ago, has been put on indefinite hold
while Parry continues to condition and rehabilitate. Parry has been
cleared to play by Mutual of Omaha, the NCAA's insurance carrier, and
had hoped to return in time for the Spartans' Sept. 28 home game
against Texas El Paso. However, swelling in his right leg and the
search for the right prosthetic device has slowed Parry's progress.
There is an outside chance he could postpone his return until next
year.</TE>
<TE>   In case you missed this important scroll at the bottom of your
favorite cable news channel, the Insight.com Bowl announced it is
dropping the "dotcom" from its bowl and will be known as the Insight
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   We're sure Florida Gator fans are aware that lowly Temple scored
more points against Miami ( 21) than Florida did (16). Florida is 2-1
entering Saturday's game at Tennessee and it's safe to say Zook's
grace period is over. Florida was booed at home during a sloppy
victory last week against Ohio, not to be confused with Ohio State.
"I've been here when they booed before," said Zook, a former Florida
assistant in the early 1990s. "No one wants to make these people
happy more than our players and staff."</TE>
<TE>   It was no surprise the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee this
week upheld sanctions for Alabama and Kentucky. The eye-popper was
Terry Don Phillips, chairman of the committee, saying that if not for
"unequivocal" cooperation of the school, the Alabama football program
would have been shut down under the NCAA's "death penalty." Kentucky,
off to a surprising 3-0 start, took the NCAA news like men. "We
started two-a-days knowing we can't go to a bowl," Kentucky Coach Guy
Morriss said. "What's changed? We still can't go."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the North Division of the Big 12 Conference had one
school in the national title game, Nebraska, and another, Colorado,
which missed making the title game by 0.05 of a bowl championship
series point. Last week, Nebraska and Colorado were outscored, 80-10,
in losses to Penn State and USC.</TE>

<LD>Take four young fillies who like to do their work on the lead, mix in
a pair of imports from the hot Paul Aguirre barn, and you have the
makings a very interesting renewal of the $50,000 Bustles and Bows
Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   The speed in this 6 1/2-furlong feature may be Hostility, who has
a victory in the Time To Leave Stakes to her credit at Bay Meadows
and gets the slight edge with Tyler Baze aboard for her introduction
to the tight turns here.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of Devil His Due is trained by the high-percentage
Tom Roberts, who won with his first starter at this meet after taking
a vacation from the racing wars.</LD>
<TE>   Following her game Bay Area decision, Hostility found the :21 4/5
opening split of the CTBA Stakes and a swift filly named Humorous
Lady to be too much to handle and faded in that July 26 affair, but
she's come back to work well, including four morning spins over this
tricky course.</TE>
<TE>   The other stakes winner in the field is My Honey Bunny, an
offspring of the impressive first-year stallion Swiss Yodeler who
took the Juan Gonzalez at Pleasanton in late June and also runs on
high octane. Zam Zam and Local Law each broke their maidens in
front-running fashion, while the Irish-bred, English-raced pair of
Margaret's Fancy and Amanda Louise are the wild cards in the lineup
and figure to be making the best late impression.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Good Cop 2. Davis 3. Ms Powful 4. Bonusita 5.
Unchain The Stars 6. Blue Souvie 7. In Season 8. Devilish Quest 9.
Salish Slew 10. Hostility 11. Sweet Peaches</TE>

<LD>The City Section is reviewing the eligibility of Gabriel Pruitt, a
Westchester High basketball player who transferred from Compton
Centennial.</LD>
<LD>   Pruitt, a top junior guard who helped Centennial reach the
Division III state championship game, is attending Westchester on an
opportunity transfer from Manual Arts, his home school.</LD>
<LD>   Barbara Fiege, the City commissioner, said eligibility issues have
been raised by people from "outside" Westchester. "There's
conflicting information," Fiege said.</LD>
<TE>   Westchester administrators have been asked to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   The Comets won the state Division I championship last season with
no players on their roster who lived within the school's attendance
boundaries.</TE>

<TE>   Lisa Baker has resigned as softball coach at Irvine after 14
seasons. Baker, who coached the Vaqueros to a Southern Section title
in 1991, had considered resigning for some time.</TE>
<TE>   "She has two kids in grade school and hung in for a couple of
years just to help us out," Athletic Director Terry Henigan said. "I
think she'll return to coaching as an assistant and she might come
back and be a head coach. But right now, her family won't allow it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rod Sherman has been chosen as the athletic director at Orange
Lutheran High. Sherman, the football team's offensive coordinator,
replaces Jim Kunau, who is also the football coach.</TE>
<TE>   Kunau left the position to direct the school's American Leadership
Institute, a developmental program on campus that will eventually
involve other high schools.</TE>

<TE>   Tesoro High does not have a senior on its campus and is playing
its first year of varsity competition, but the girls' volleyball team
defeated Trabuco Hills in three games on Tuesday and San Clemente in
four games last week.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad work for the second-year school in Las Flores, which is
awaiting completion of its gym. Construction is expected to be
finished in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're maybe a little ahead of schedule [as a team], but I'll take
it," said John Gipe, who coached at Capistrano Valley for 19 seasons
before taking the job at Tesoro. "We're 2-0, but you know how the
business goes. You've got to keep proving yourself."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Glenn Thompkins knows what it's like to win.</LD>
<LD>   And, after his coaching debut for Rialto Eisenhower on Friday,
what it's like to lose. And lose big.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a mess," said Thompkins, who led Eisenhower to a 56-3 rout
of Santa Ana Mater Dei in the 1993 Southern Section Division I
championship game. "I didn't imagine that.</LD>
<TE>   "As a young coach, I want to go 14-0 my first year. I don't think
anybody thinks, 'What if I get shut out?' "</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins, 27, is believed to be the youngest varsity football
head coach in San Bernardino County history. His initiation came in a
49-0 loss to Corona Centennial, the Eagles' worst loss in at least
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins replaced Tom Hoak, who retired after 19 seasons and this
year became the school's athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins' day started badly, and got worse. Both Eisenhower team
buses encountered problems on their way to Centennial High. A hatch
flew open on one and the other was involved in a fender bender less
than a mile from the school. Both arrived late.</TE>
<TE>   "Hoak told me he never had a bus problem his entire career,"
Thompkins said.</TE>
<TE>   Once the game got under way, it didn't get any better:</TE>
<TE>   * Thompkins has good receivers, but at least three passes were
dropped, including one to a wide-open receiver in the end zone with
30 seconds remaining. They caught only one of 12 passes for 11 yards.</TE>
<TE>   * Though four starters returned on the offensive line,
quarterbacks Jon Brownbridge and Michael Penn were tackled eight
times for losses.</TE>
<TE>   * The defense had to stop the run and make Centennial pass the
ball, but Centennial passed for 221 yards and its offense rushed for
99 yards and four touchdowns, three by Terrell Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's two different worlds," said Thompkins, who had a hand in 29
passing or rushing touchdowns his senior season. "With the coaching
thing, there's more on my shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people who are expecting us to be mediocre or average,
and we're used to being one of the top programs around. There are a
lot of eyes on us. I feel like I could control it more when I was
playing."</TE>
<TE>   Thompkins had been groomed the last three years to replace Hoak,
serving as his offensive coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   "He's enthusiastic, he loves football, he's great with kids," Hoak
said. "He has all the ingredients we look for. It could have been
149-0, we're still happy with our choice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The automobile that clipped Eisenhower's bus on the Magnolia
Avenue off-ramp in Corona did not stop, so a half-dozen coaches
jumped off the bus to pursue the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Strength and conditioning coach Walter Ford managed to face down
the driver at a stoplight.</TE>
<TE>   "I stood in front of the car and said, 'Stop,' " Ford said. "We
convinced him to pull into the parking lot. The guy was driving,
like, a 30-year-old Buick LeSabre. If it was a Saturn, I'd have
tackled it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Confusion reigns among coaches and officials when it comes to
Southern Section's football Rule 1906.14. It's the rule that allows
teams to play overtime in nonleague games if both coaches agree
beforehand. If either objects, overtime won't be played.</TE>
<TE>   Officials have been inconsistent in asking coaches what they want
to do in a tie situation. Some officials' associations are being more
pro-active in asking before kickoff. Sometimes, coaches haven't been
asked.</TE>
<TE>   Newhall Hart Coach Mike Herrington told officials before kickoff
that he didn't want to play overtime, to the chagrin of Los Alamitos
Coach John Barnes. Hart scored on a last-play, 68-yard pass from Sean
Norton to Cody Kase and tied Los Alamitos, 21-21.</TE>
<TE>   Officials did not ask coaches before the Orange Lutheran-Mater Dei
game. Jim Kunau, whose Orange Lutheran squad pulled to within 21-20
of Mater Dei with three seconds left, chose to go for the victory
with a two-point conversion, which failed, rather than kick to tie
the score and set up overtime. Kunau said he didn't know overtime was
an option.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Kunau said he received a call from an official who
asked if the tie-breaking option had been presented before kickoff.
Kunau said it hadn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not upset with our officials," Kunau said. "I don't blame
them in any way, shape or form. But I do think that if that's the
protocol, it's important that it be followed."</TE>
<TE>   But at its heart, it isn't protocol. The rule has been in place
for at least 17 years, according to Rob Wigod, the section's
assistant commissioner in charge of football. It is included in the
annual Southern Section Blue Book and football preview, which are
sent to every head coach in August, but not to officials.</TE>
<TE>   Wigod said there's no excuse for not playing overtime if the
coaches want it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incumbent on the coaches to know the rules, and they could
just as easily notify the officials without being asked," Wigod said.
"The decision to play overtime rests squarely on the shoulders of the
coaches of the teams playing the [nonleague] football game.</TE>
<TE>   "The rule doesn't say that the officials should ask the question."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest workhorses last week was Tom Cleveland of West
Torrance. He carried the ball 46 times and gained 236 yards in a
56-39 victory over South Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   The 46 attempts ties him for 12th highest in section history. The
record is 55 carries by Larry Ned of Rancho Verde in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano St. Margaret's Hutch Parker, a junior, kicked
a 60-yard field goal during the Tartans' 47-8 victory at Fontana
Ambassador Christian, placing him second in section history.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll kick 50, 55 yards in practice, but I discounted them
because we have a nice tailwind in the afternoon, there's the snap,
the hold, other factors," said his coach, Brady Lock. "He asked, 'Can
I kick a field goal?' We didn't think in terms of him making it, but
in moving the ball downfield [to the 20-yard line] like a punt if he
missed. He didn't get a lot of help from the tailwind, but he had
some clearance--it's not like he skimmed the crossbar."</TE>
<TE>   Parker is tied with three others, including former NFL kicker Luis
Zendejas of Chino Don Lugo (1980). The record is 64 yards by Eric
Affholter of Oak Park in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With its 32-3 victory over Moreno Valley Valley View, La Quinta
stretched its unbeaten streak to 27 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Blackhawks are 26-0-1 in that span, and have won back-to-back
Division VIII titles. They have won 12 in a row, and play host to
Murrieta Valley on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   They will continue to be without one of their best players, Joe
Jiannoni, a linebacker and fullback. He broke his shoulder in a
scrimmage against Eisenhower and will be out at least four weeks.</TE>

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION</LD>
<LD>   Thousand Oaks (1-0) vs. Ventura Buena (1-0) at Ventura High, 7:30,
tonight</LD>
<LD>   Buena tailback Alex Garfio will get the ball a lot after rushing
for 252 yards and four touchdowns and catching six passes for 56
yards in a 40-13 victory over Agoura. Thousand Oaks defeated
Crescenta Valley, 27-16, as junior quarterback Chris Owens threw for
229 yards and a touchdown. Owens, a transfer from Simi Valley Grace
Brethren, was starting in place of Brad Sievert, who suffered a
fractured collarbone in a scrimmage against Ventura on Sept. 6.</LD>
<TE>   John Ortega</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Mission Viejo (1-0) vs. No. 14 Santa Ana Mater Dei (1-0) at
Santa Ana Stadium, 7 p.m., Friday, Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo is looking to make it two victories in a row over
Mater Dei after the Monarchs dominated the series in the 1990s. If
the teams' openers are any indication, this game could be a rout.
Mission Viejo pounded Fountain Valley, 48-0, while Mater Dei held on
to beat Orange Lutheran, 21-20, when the Lancers' late two-point
conversion failed. Diablo quarterback Matt Uritis will continue to
fill in for the injured Josh Rodarmel, who fractured a collarbone
last week. Look for quarterback Jesse Mier to start over Jason
Forcier after leading Mater Dei last week to touchdowns on all three
drives in which he played.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Ventura St. Bonaventure (1-0) vs. No. 6 Newhall Hart
(0-0-1) at College of the Canyons, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   St. Bonaventure, the three-time defending Division XI champion,
risks its 43-game win streak against Hart, the four-time defending
Division III champion. St. Bonaventure's heavily recruited receiver,
Whitney Lewis, finally gets to show what he can do against quality
competition. Hart is coming off a 21-21 tie with Los Alamitos, during
which sophomore quarterback Sean Norton passed for 245 yards. St.
Bonaventure junior quarterback Brian Stevens passed for 330 yards and
six touchdowns in a 52-0 victory over Dos Palos.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Redlands (1-0) vs. No. 7 Santa Margarita (1-0) at
Saddleback College, 7:30 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Credit Redlands for taking a step up in competition by scheduling
Santa Margarita. The Terriers last season breezed through a
comparatively weak nonleague schedule, swept their Citrus Belt League
opponents and then got rolled, 42-28, by Mater Dei in the playoffs.
Both teams feature ground-oriented attacks. Running back Mark Jurado
averaged 16.6 yards a carry last week in amassing 216 yards for
Redlands in its 28-6 victory over Yucaipa. Ashton White had 90 yards
in 27 carries for Santa Margarita in its 17-10 victory against Orange
El Modena.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Fontana Kaiser (0-0-1) vs. No. 9 Riverside North (1-0) at
Riverside College, 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   It's the first meeting between these Inland Empire powers. North,
the defending Division V champion, was penalized 13 times in its
29-13 victory over Rancho Verde. Running back Joshua Barnett and
quarterback Dion Morton lead a balanced attack. Kaiser, the Division
VIII runner-up last year, fumbled four times, allowed a safety and
needed a last-minute touchdown and two-point conversion for a 29-29
tie with Rancho Cucamonga. Running back Allen Wade rushed for 150
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (1-0) at Westlake Village Westlake (1-0),
7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   The traditional powers figure to have a close, competitive game.
Notre Dame, despite having a team dominated by underclassmen,
defeated Lake Balboa Birmingham, 24-20, last week. Collin Morgan
scored on a 10-yard run with 44 seconds left to give the Knights the
victory. Westlake had no trouble in a 45-0 victory against
overmatched Santa Paula. The Warriors had nine sacks and held Santa
Paula to less than 75 yards of offense.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Carson (1-0) at No. 8 Woodland Hills Taft (1-0), 7 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   With great matchups on both sides, this game could be a preview of
the City Section championship game. Can Carson's secondary keep Steve
Smith, Noah Smith and Paul Pratt from making big plays? Is Taft's
defense, which had trouble stopping Crenshaw on the ground last week,
tough enough to contain the Colts' stable of running backs? Can
Carson's defense get to quarterback Cary Dove? Will this be the
breakout game for Carson's talented quarterback, Beau Davis?</TE>

<LD>JEFF FERRIER</LD>
<LD>   School: Mission Viejo</LD>
<LD>   Position: Kicker</LD>
<TE>   Height: 6-3</TE>
<TE>   Weight: 210</TE>
<TE>   With Mission Viejo's prolific offense, there hadn't been much need
for Jeff Ferrier to kick field goals--he attempted only five last
season and two were blocked.</TE>
<TE>   But with an injury last week to starting quarterback Josh Rodarmel
that could keep him sidelined for at least five weeks, that will
change. Ferrier could become a critical part of the offense beginning
Friday, when the Diablos, No. 4 in The Times' rankings, play No. 14
Santa Ana Mater Dei.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeff is a weapon," Coach Bob Johnson said, "and if we have to
kick a long field goal, we'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   Over the summer, Ferrier attended the National Kicking Service
camp at Cal Lutheran, where he won the field-goal kicking contest
with a 60-yarder and the kickoff contest with a 74-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   "I coach 60 kids and I have three kickers in the Pac-10, but Jeff
is my first NFL prospect," said Jim Power, a former Arena League
kicker who runs the NKS camp. "I'd be willing to bet $1,000 to $100
that he's one of the top 15 kickers in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Of Ferrier 's 74 kickoffs last season, 68 were touchbacks, and two
that didn't reach the end zone were on-side kicks. He made two field
goals, and converted 56 of 60 point-after attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to do my job when I'm called upon," the senior said.
"Now my role is much bigger.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt important, but now, I feel like there are
game-winning points riding on me."</TE>

<LD>Trainer Donna McArthur has two quarter horses entered in the 300-yard
seventh race tonight, but that means jockey Sam Thompson is switching
horses.</LD>
<LD>   After seven consecutive mounts aboard Quicks Trick, Thompson is
riding Shez Simply Fabulous. Cody Jensen takes Thompson's place
aboard Quicks Trick, who broke her maiden at 300 and finished in the
money twice at either 220 or 300 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Shez Simply Fabulous ran fifth at 350 yards last time, but
previously won a 300-yard sprint.</LD>
<TE>   Holland Chickie, with Joe Badilla Jr. aboard, has finished second
to Quicks Trick at 220 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Pritzi Too, 2. Fleet Year, 3. Anneal, 4. Dashing
Pro, 5. Dazzlin Ta Fame, 6. Mornings Snow, 7. Shez Simply Fabulous,
8. EG Special Ways.</TE>
<TE>   Pick four: Take recent runner-up Red Dirt Girl and Pritzi Too in
the first, morning-line favorite Dream Journey and Fleet Year in the
second, Cheer The Royal, Anneal and Flying Tapestry in the third and
Dashing Pro and Swift Intruder in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: In the fifth, Twotimesthefly makes his first
local start and Dazzlin Ta Fame, a winner last time out, could
dazzle. In the 300-yard seventh, Fiery Beduino will break from the
outside post in gate six. She had success from that gate at the same
distance in February.</TE>

<HD>Charles Woodson Out for Up to Six Weeks</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oakland Raider cornerback Charles Woodson will be sidelined up to six
weeks because of a fractured right shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Woodson was injured midway through the second quarter of the
Raiders' 30-17 victory at Pittsburgh on Sunday but kept playing. An
MRI test Tuesday revealed the fracture.</LD>
<LD>   "He will be missed," Coach Bill Callahan said Wednesday. "It's a
blow, because he's a four-time Pro Bowl player. When you have a
quality corner of Charles' caliber, who's played at an All-Star
level, that's hard to replace. It's something we have to overcome."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina Panther offensive lineman Chris Terry has been tested for
drugs more than a dozen times by the NFL in recent months, according
to court papers filed by his estranged wife in a domestic violence
case.</TE>
<TE>   Nyquell Jackson-Terry filed the papers in Mecklenburg District
Court this week, asking for copies of documents concerning urine
samples taken from Terry by an NFL drug program agent.</TE>
<TE>   The allegation comes as the couple square off in civil court.
Jackson-Terry has accused her husband of breaking down a bedroom door
in July while armed with a handgun and pushing her into a wall at
their home in Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Terry was not available for interviews following the Panthers'
practice, and Coach John Fox did not address the issue during a media
session.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta quarterback Michael Vick said that a Chicago coach
screamed "take his knees out" during the Falcons' 14-13 loss to the
Bears on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Vick made the allegations, backed up by teammate Willie Jackson,
against Bear defensive coordinator Greg Blache.</TE>
<TE>   "They were coming up to hit me," Vick said. "I heard one of their
coaches scream, 'Take his knees out!' That was their goal, to knock
me out of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Blache denied he wanted to injure Vick.</TE>
<TE>   "He got his butt beat and now he wants to make somebody look bad,"
Blache said. "Unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   The Bears were penalized three times for roughing Vick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Washington, the 350-pound anchor of Chicago's defensive line,
could be sidelined for the season because of a ruptured ligament in
his left foot and a broken bone in his left ankle. Washington, who
hasn't sat out a game since 1994, was injured in the Bears' victory
at Atlanta on Sunday....Joey Harrington, the third overall pick in
April's NFL draft, will start at quarterback for Detroit against
Green Bay on Sunday. Harrington played behind second-year quarterback
Mike McMahon in the first two games, both blowout losses for the
Lions, who are 2-16 in the last two seasons....Green Bay right tackle
Mark Tauscher will sit out the rest of the season after tearing knee
ligaments in the Packers' 35-20 loss to New Orleans on
Sunday....Aaron Gibson, a 6-foot-6 offensive tackle and the NFL's
heaviest player at 410 pounds, was released by the Dallas Cowboys.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Greg Colbrunn hit for the cycle, including two two-run homers, and
scored four times as the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the San Diego
Padres, 10-3, Wednesday night at San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   The defending World Series-champion Diamondbacks reduced their
magic number to five for clinching their second consecutive National
League West title.</LD>
<LD>   Colbrunn went five for six to set a career high and tie a club
record for hits. He completed the cycle with a triple into the
right-field corner with one out in the ninth. Going into the game,
Colbrunn had only 10 triples in 2,660 career at-bats.</LD>
<TE>   Colbrunn singled and scored in the first inning, struck out in the
third, hit a 406-foot, two-run homer in the fourth, doubled and
scored in the sixth, and hit a two-run homer in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   It was his first career cycle and the second in Diamondback
history. The first was by Luis Gonzalez on July 5, 2000, at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Williams hit a homer in the fourth to support Rick Helling
(9-11), who won for the first time in seven starts.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona won for only the second time in eight games in San Diego
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Padre rookie left-hander Oliver Perez (3-4) had his winless streak
reach eight starts. He gave up six runs in four innings.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 8, Colorado 5--Scott Rolen homered twice, including a
tiebreaking two-run drive in the ninth inning at Denver, and the
Cardinals cut their magic number to four to clinch the NL Central.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis had five homers and three doubles. The game was played
in 50-degree temperatures and was delayed 1 hour 19 minutes in the
third inning because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 3, Milwaukee 1--Brad Lidge had run-scoring hits in his
first two major league at-bats and pitched three scoreless innings at
Milwaukee before coming out because of a strained ribcage muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee's Jose Hernandez struck out twice, moving within one of
the season record of 189, set by Bobby Bonds in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 6, Atlanta 5--Pinch-hitter Jeremy Giambi's three-run
homer in the fifth helped lift the Phillies at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   It was Giambi's second career pinch-hit homer. Jose Mesa worked
the ninth for his 41st save.</TE>
<TE>   New York 2, Chicago 1--Mike Piazza hit a two-run homer and the
Mets won their fifth in a row at Shea Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Hundley hit his 200th career homer and Kerry Wood (11-10)
reached 200 strikeouts for the second consecutive season for the
Cubs, who lost for the eighth time in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3, Cincinnati 2--Pinch-hitter Rob Mackowiak hit a
two-run single, capping host Pittsburgh's three-run rally in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates overcame home runs by Ken Griffey Jr. and Jose
Guillen. Mike Williams worked the ninth for his 43rd save.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Florida 2--Vladimir Guerrero singled home the go-ahead
run in the 11th inning at Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Derrek Lee hit a two-run single in the ninth to tie the
score, 2-2. The rally began when Kevin Millar singled to extend his
hitting streak to 24 games.</TE>

<HD>Sierra Comes Through for Mariners in a Pinch</HD>
<DH>Baseball: His single in the 10th inning gives Seattle a 3-2
victory over Texas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Pinch-hitter Ruben Sierra singled home the winning run in the 10th
inning and the Seattle Mariners defeated Texas, 3-2, Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   It was Seattle's their third consecutive extra-inning victory over
the Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   Seattle remained seven games back in the American League wild-card
race with 10 games to play.</LD>
<TE>   Jeff Cirillo singled against Dennys Reyes (4-3), Ichiro Suzuki
sacrificed, Mike Cameron walked and Edgar Martinez was walked
intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra then singled down the left-field line against Francisco
Cordero. Texas had played six infielders, all drawn in, and two
outfielders.</TE>
<TE>   Kazuhiro Sasaki (4-5) pitched the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   In a vintage Lou Piniella tantrum, the Mariner manager was thrown
out in the bottom of the ninth after Ben Davis was thrown out at
first base on a close play that ended the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The 59-year-old Piniella threw his hat, kicked his hat, kicked the
infield dirt, picked up first base and heaved it down the right-field
line twice, and bench coach John McLaren restrained him from getting
to umpire C.B. Bucknor, who ejected Piniella.</TE>
<TE>   With runners at third base and second base, Davis hit a ball off
pitcher Jay Powell's glove to second baseman Michael Young, who
barely got Davis at first.</TE>
<TE>   Saying he was tired after going five for 32 in his previous eight
games, All-Star Alex Rodriguez did not start.</TE>
<TE>   But Rodriguez came in as pinch-hitter in the ninth and went to
shortstop, increasing his consecutive-game streak to 377 games, third
longest in the major leagues.</TE>
<TE>   Texas took a 2-0 lead in the second on Carl Everett's run-scoring
double and Herbert Perry's run-scoring single.</TE>
<TE>   Cirillo hit a run-scoring single in the bottom half, and Desi

<HD>Emanuel Creates Big Plays and a Flexible Secondary</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ben Emanuel is proving to be a ball magnet. Big Play Ben.</LD>
<LD>   Which is making him the last piece of the puzzle that would enable
Matt Ware to move from free safety to cornerback.</LD>
<LD>   Last week against Oklahoma State, Emanuel had an interception in
each half.</LD>
<TE>   In the Bruins' opener, he returned a fumble 89 yards on a Colorado
State two-point conversion attempt with 1:30 to play, cementing the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Last season in his first career start, he had two interceptions
against Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking to make an impact," Emanuel said. "I'm looking for
ways to turn the momentum our way."</TE>
<TE>   Emanuel, a sophomore, won the job at strong safety this fall
despite missing spring practice because he was recovering from
shoulder surgery. He moved to free safety in the third quarter
against Oklahoma State when Ware suffered a sprained ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Although Emanuel will return to strong safety Saturday against
Colorado, eventually he is expected to play free safety when the
6-foot-3 Ware plays cornerback to match up against tall receivers.</TE>
<TE>   "Ben Emanuel has done a fabulous job, and that's a big reason we
feel comfortable moving Ware to corner when the situation dictates,"
Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Free safety was Emanuel's position at Clear Brook High in
Friendswood, Texas, and he had 13 interceptions there.</TE>
<TE>   He chose UCLA in part because his cousin, former NFL receiver Bert
Emanuel, played in 1990 for the Bruins before transferring to Rice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UCLA is plus five in the turnover department, forcing five by
Oklahoma State and two by Colorado State while committing only one in
each game.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have intercepted five passes and recovered two
fumbles--not counting the pivotal fumble caused by Spencer Havner and
recovered and returned for two points by Emanuel.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA has converted turnovers into three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin turnovers are interceptions thrown by Cory Paus and were
converted into 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior receiver Jon Dubravac will start ahead of Tab Perry because
Dubravac is from Denver. He missed last season because of a back
injury and does not have a catch this season.... Fullback J.D. Groves
suffered a sprained neck Wednesday and is questionable for Saturday.</TE>

<HD>They're Waiting for Polamalu in Manhattan</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC players anticipate a hostile environment when they travel to No.
25 Kansas State on Saturday, and All-American safety Troy Polamalu
will be the main target for abuse from Wildcat players and fans.</LD>
<LD>   "Oh, yeah, there might be a bounty on him," Kansas State junior
linebacker Josh Buhl told the Kansas City Star in Wednesday's
editions. "There's a lot of revenge going on."</LD>
<LD>   In last season's 10-6 loss to Kansas State at the Coliseum,
Polamalu leveled punt returner Aaron Lockett with a
helmet-to-facemask shot as Lockett prepared to field a kick in the
third quarter. The Trojans were penalized 15 yards for the hit.</LD>
<TE>   Polamalu later apologized to Lockett, who no longer plays for the
Wildcats. Polamalu reiterated again Wednesday that he meant no harm.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in the heat of the moment and I was just trying to hustle
down there," he said. "I was trying to give him as little room as
possible and I made a huge misjudgment. I've put it behind me."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu, who made a team-high 11 tackles Saturday against
Colorado, said he would not be watching his back against Kansas
State.</TE>
<TE>   "If they try to block me any differently, somebody else will make
the play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC's offensive linemen were full of energy at practice Wednesday
after quarterback Carson Palmer took them out to dinner the night
before.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, a fifth-year senior, treated linemen in years past but
never this early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer, who was sacked 36 times last season, has been sacked only
once in victories over Auburn and Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to do it, if I could afford to, every week, but
those guys can really eat," Palmer said. "They need to be rewarded
for the way they are playing and allowing us to move the ball and win
games."</TE>
<TE>   Junior tackle Jacob Rogers was grateful. "If we can continue to
keep his jersey clean, I'm sure he'll appreciate that," Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A statue of USC's famed 1969 defensive line known as the "Wild
Bunch" is on display outside Heritage Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The statue, featuring images of Charles Weaver, Al Cowlings,
Willard "Bubba" Scott, Tody Smith and Jimmy Gunn, was created by Don
Winton and Ernie Shelton, a former USC high jumper.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see some defensive linemen get some love around
here," sophomore defensive end Kenechi Udeze said. "I hope maybe one
day they'll think about us in 40 or 50 years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen got more opportunities with the field-goal unit, but
Coach Pete Carroll said David Davis would still be the first kicker
if the Kansas State game were today. Carroll said the competition
would continue today.... Receiver Mike Williams completed about half
of practice before sitting out because of back spasms, Carroll said.</TE>

<HD>Accused Santa Ana Trustees Cleared</HD>
<DH>Schools: The Orange County D.A.'s office and an outside
lawyer both find no evidence of bribery or conflict of interest in
the awarding of construction money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two separate investigations into allegations that Santa Ana school
trustees played political favorites in awarding millions of dollars
in school construction money have found no evidence of criminal
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   The accusations, contained in an anonymous letter sent to Santa
Ana school officials in March, were forwarded to the Orange County
district attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana Unified School District Supt. Al Mijares also hired an
outside attorney to conduct a separate probe.</LD>
<TE>   Both concluded there was no indication of illegal acts.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigation did not establish any evidence of bribery nor
conflict of interest," Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Thomas Crofoot said
in an Aug. 27 letter to a trustee.</TE>
<TE>   "No one interviewed during this investigation was able to point to
any firsthand information that would indicate criminal wrongdoing on
the part of any of the board members."</TE>
<TE>   Mijares said Wednesday that the outside law firm reached a similar
conclusion, which was presented to the five-member Board of Trustees
in a closed session Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The anonymous letter, by someone claiming to be a district
employee, alleged "blatant corruption" by some trustees, including
the board's president, but was short on details and names.</TE>
<TE>   John Palacio, the current board president, declined to comment
Wednesday, saying that even to acknowledge the letter would be
patently unfair because its allegations are groundless.</TE>
<TE>   The letter has rattled nerves in Orange County's largest and
severely overcrowded school district as it moves toward what is
likely to be a hotly contested board election in November.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of construction in the district is expected to be an
issue. Santa Ana passed Measure C, a $145-million school construction
bond, in 1999, and has applied for an additional $185 million in
state funds.</TE>
<TE>   The letter accused "certain board members" of awarding
construction oversight to Del Terra Real Estates Services Inc. based
more on the Los Angeles firm's connection to some trustees than on
its qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   The letter praised trustee and former board president Nadia Maria
Davis but accused Palacio of issuing orders to staff members without
approval or knowledge of other trustees, among other things. Davis
and Palacio are up for reelection Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the outside reviews were important to quell speculation
and to get the district moving forward with the job of building
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The district is set to break ground today for a new elementary
school on Civic Center Drive near Santa Ana stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Heroes Elementary School is being named for police officers and
firefighters who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks in New
York City last year.</TE>
<TE>   The 62,000-student district originally planned to build 11
elementary schools and two high schools with proceeds from Measure C
and state matching funds.</TE>
<TE>   It has since scaled back the number of new schools, opting instead
to enlarge several existing campuses.</TE>
<TE>   District officials cited scarcity of land in the fast-growing city
as the reason for the change, but said the new plans will serve the
same number of students.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Measure C won voter approval, trustees voted to hire
Del Terra as lead consultant on the construction projects, a role the
staff has previously kept in-house.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since, Del Terra and some staff members have clashed on a
number of occasions, according to several district employees.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Nativo Lopez said that some staff members may resent
outsiders managing the projects but that he stood by the firm's
qualifications.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the district hired architect Bill Sharp, who helped
build schools in several school districts in Southern California, to
the new position of chief facilities officer, in part to help smooth
relations between the staff and the consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Davis suggested the tension may result from the pressure everyone
in the district is feeling given the complexities and uncertainties
over finding school sites and getting campuses built in a district
that has struggled with portable classrooms for decades.</TE>
<TE>   The state's voters still must pass a separate bond measure in
November for Santa Ana and other school districts to receive matching
funds.</TE>
<TE>   "The staff is frustrated, we are frustrated, the state is
frustrated," Davis said. "Everyone is frustrated, and people lash out
at each other."</TE>

<HD>Vote to Zone El Toro as Park Upheld</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge says O.C. electorate wasn't duped into
believing the former base would be free of development. Airport
backers consider appeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Die-hard El Toro airport supporters were dealt a blow Wednesday when
a judge ruled that Orange County voters had the right to rezone the
closed Marine base from aviation use to parkland.</LD>
<LD>   The decision effectively upholds the heart of Measure W, the
ballot initiative passed in March. Airport backers had claimed in a
lawsuit that the initiative violated state law.</LD>
<LD>   The coalition--which includes the Airport Working Group of Orange
County, the Orange County Regional Airport Authority and Citizens for
Jobs and the Economy--argued that the initiative, which killed plans
to build an airport at the base, was a "bait and switch" that falsely
promised voters that El Toro would be preserved as open space.</LD>
<TE>   In reality, the coalition argued, the plan that Irvine unveiled
after the vote calls for housing, shopping, museums, an educational
complex and a transit village.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-airport attorneys further argued that even if voters knew
exactly what they were voting for, state law dictates that the
land-use plan for a closed military base can be changed only by the
Orange County Board of Supervisors and never by referendum.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Philip H. Hickok disagreed on
both counts. He ruled that voters were not duped into believing that
the "Great Park" would be free of development, and that a ballot
initiative can be used to alter a land-use plan for a closed military
base.</TE>
<TE>   "A general [land-use] plan can be amended by initiative," he said.
"This is not inconsistent with or in conflict with the county's
General Plan."</TE>
<TE>   Hickok said that the only circumstance in which a ballot
initiative could not change the county land-use plan would be if the
Legislature passed a law that specifically prohibited it.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling naturally delighted opponents of an El Toro airport.
"Not even all the king's horses and all the king's men could put the
El Toro airport back together again," said Supervisor Todd Spitzer,
one of the board's two-vote minority opposed to an airport at the
base.</TE>
<TE>   "This train has not only left the station, it has arrived at
another destination. What other event has to occur for these people
to understand [that] this is not going to be an airport?"</TE>
<TE>   Under Measure W, Irvine will annex the base from the county and
zone more than 80% of it for a park. The Navy will concurrently sell
the base to developers, who will be permitted to build on the
remainder and must preserve the parts zoned as parkland as a
condition of sale.</TE>
<TE>   But even the judge predicted that litigation over El Toro will not
end with his ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time you have emotions that run so deep, there are going to
be hard feelings," Hickok said. "I assume there are going to be
appeals."</TE>
<TE>   Fredric Woocher, an attorney for airport supporters, said he would
consult his clients about filing an appeal. He noted that the Navy's
intention to move ahead with the sale within months puts pressure on
opponents of the park plan to get their case before appeals judges as
soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody feels a pressing need to get this resolved," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Woocher argued during Wednesday's court hearing in Norwalk that
the park plan is a sham.</TE>
<TE>   "In an effort to sell the measure to voters, they proclaimed [the
base] will remain as open space," he said. "But it is no longer open
space.... There will be 10-story buildings, housing, employment, you
name it."</TE>
<TE>   But Hickok appeared more swayed by arguments from park supporters
that voters were promised a park similar to Balboa Park in San Diego
or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, both of which include
significant development in the form of museums, theaters, zoos and
educational complexes.</TE>
<TE>   Some issues brought up in the airport supporters' suit remain
unresolved by Wednesday's ruling. They include a claim that Measure W
violates provisions of the state-mandated transportation plan
requiring Orange County to satisfy its "fair share" of regional air
traffic needs, and another claim that the ballot measure "falsely
represents" to voters that a park can be created at no cost to
taxpayers, when that may not be the case.</TE>
<TE>   No date has been set to hear those portions of the suit. Like most
court challenges involving El Toro, this case was heard outside the
county to avoid a potential of conflict-of-interest.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Kuperberg, an attorney for Irvine, said even with some of the
lawsuit yet to be argued, Wednesday's verdict paved the way for park
supporters to put legal challenges behind them and move ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "The court correctly found today that the right of voters to pass
an initiative is a fundamental right that will not be blithely set
aside," he said.</TE>

<HD>Law Paves the Way for O.C. to Buy, Widen 91 Toll Lanes</HD>
<DH>Transit: Governor signs bill that removes obstacles to
improving congested freeway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday cleared the way for the Orange County
Transportation Authority to buy the privately owned 91 Express Lanes
that run along the middle of the traffic-swamped Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The move is expected to end one of the state's most controversial
experiments in speeding up highway construction by allowing private
firms to build tollways.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Bill 1010, signed late Wednesday by Davis, allows OCTA to
complete the purchase of the lanes early next year, go into the toll
road business for itself and eliminate a clause that had given the
toll-lane owners the extraordinary power to block improvements to the
congested Riverside Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   "This will allow badly needed improvements to Route 91," Davis
said. "The 91 can be an absolute nightmare for commuters who commonly
take a full hour just to travel 10 miles."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA needs the legislation to acquire the Express Lanes for $207.5
million and operate them as a tollway until the turnpike's $135
million in bonds can be paid off.</TE>
<TE>   The deal was struck in April with California Private
Transportation Co., a consortium that owns the lanes. Under the
agreement, OCTA will assume the operation's debts and pay the company
$72.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Without the passage of the Assembly bill, OCTA officials feared
the owners would back out of the deal or ask for more money. Either
might have doomed any major freeway improvement.</TE>
<TE>   The bill "represents a local solution to a local problem," said
the bills' sponsor, Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana). "It shows
that private toll roads are an experiment that is failing."</TE>
<TE>   The 91 Express Lanes run for 10 miles along the center of the
Riverside Freeway, from northern Anaheim to the Riverside County
line. They opened in December 1995 with two lanes in each direction
and were one of four privately owned tollways the Legislature
approved more than a decade ago. Two of the approved projects are
presumed dead, and a third is only now being planned.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials want to quickly phase out the toll operation and
launch $1.6 billion in improvements to the freeway in Orange and
Riverside counties. Tolls, now among the highest per-mile fees in the
country, also may be lowered.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they can provide some relief out there quickly," said
Leif Grane of Corona, who spends hours a day on the Riverside Freeway
getting to and from work in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill cheered the fact that it eliminates a
protection clause that Caltrans had originally granted the road's
owner.</TE>
<TE>   To help the Express Lanes succeed, Caltrans gave California
Private Transportation the power to veto improvements along a 30-mile
stretch of the freeway until 2030.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the restrictions have aggravated congestion on the
Riverside Freeway, which links the fast-growing Inland Empire to
Orange County's ample job market.</TE>
<TE>   On workdays, motorists make at least 250,000 trips on the freeway.
The number of daily trips is projected to swell to at least 400,000
by 2020.</TE>
<TE>   "This has put everyone in handcuffs for the past 10 years," said
Caltrans Director Jeff Morales. "The Legislature has made it loud and
clear it doesn't want the state headed in that direction anymore."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Express Lanes' agreement, the bill contains
broader provisions barring state franchises for future privately
owned toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions, however, do not affect the company that is
planning to build State Route 125 in San Diego--one of the four
franchises the state originally approved.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking forward to a partnership with Caltrans," said Todd
Spitzer, an Orange County supervisor and OCTA board chairman who has
led the effort to buy the tollway. The Express Lanes agreement
"rewarded congestion and punished commuters who were just trying to
get to their jobs."</TE>
<TE>   The bill also establishes an advisory committee for the Riverside
Freeway corridor that includes five members from Orange County, five
from Riverside County, two Caltrans regional directors and one San
Bernardino County representative.</TE>
<TE>   The panel will make recommendations to the OCTA board of
directors.</TE>

<HD>Caltrans to Allow All Freeway Banners</HD>
<DH>Policy: State agency reverses ban and says flags and signs
are OK, as long as they are secure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reversing a previous order, the California Department of
Transportation has decided to allow all banners, signs and
flags--regardless of the message--to be flown on bridges and highway
overpasses.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans' policy on freeway displays came under scrutiny when two
Santa Cruz women sued the state agency last year, charging that it
routinely removed banners with unpopular messages while allowing
flags to fly on overpasses and bridges.</LD>
<LD>   In January, a federal judge presiding over the lawsuit ordered
Caltrans to adopt consistent guidelines for flags and banners on
freeway property. Immediately after the ruling, Caltrans officials
said they would remove all banners and flags, including the hundreds
of American flags hung after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   But in court papers filed this month, Caltrans officials said
every district director in the state has since been instructed to
allow all flags, banners and signs installed by the public to be
displayed, so long as they do not pose a safety risk.</TE>
<TE>   Several free-speech advocates, including the two Santa Cruz women
who filed the lawsuit, plan to test Caltrans' new edict today by
hanging banners on freeway overpasses in Santa Cruz and San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Courtney, one of the two plaintiffs, called the agency's new
stand on freeway displays a victory for free speech.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we wanted from the start," Courtney said in an
interview from her Santa Cruz home. "One year later and countless tax
dollars later, it is interesting that they have finally chosen to
abide by the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans spokesman Dennis Trujillo said the state agency
reconsidered its original response to the judge's orders and decided
to allow all securely fastened signs and banners on bridges and
overpasses so that the American flags can continue to fly on state
freeways.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted, however, that Caltrans has not changed its
long-standing policy of allowing only securely fastened flags on
freeway property.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Trujillo said, Caltrans is simply abiding by the ruling,
which Caltrans hopes to overturn on appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a shift in policy," he said. "It is our response to a
court order."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit was filed after Courtney and her friend Cassandra
Brown hung a banner on a freeway overpass in the Northern California
community of Scotts Valley in November.</TE>
<TE>   The overpass was already adorned with a large American flag and a
banner that read, "SC{heart}NY" (Santa Cruz loves New York). The
women's 7-by-5-foot banner questioned the American bombing mission in
Afghanistan with the message: "At What Cost?"</TE>
<TE>   The women had planned on adding another banner that read, "Are You
Buying This War?" But before they could install the second banner,
the first banner was removed by a Scotts Valley police officer, who
left the flag and the "SC{heart}NY" sign in place.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney said she and Brown hung other freeway signs questioning
America's foreign policy following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
but those were removed as well.</TE>
<TE>   In challenging the removal of the signs, the women learned that
Caltrans prohibited all banners from overpasses and bridges but
allowed securely fastened flags. Courtney and Brown sued, arguing
that the policy violated the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of
speech.</TE>
<TE>   In January, U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte issued a
preliminary injunction, ruling that Caltrans cannot allow the public
to hang flags along the freeways while barring other signs. Whyte
ordered Caltrans to either remove all banners, signs and flags or
draft a policy allowing all such displays, regardless of content.</TE>
<TE>   In response, Caltrans officials announced in January that the
agency would remove all banners and flags.</TE>
<TE>   But attorneys for the two women complained that Caltrans officials
had failed to submit to the judge a clear policy on the matter. In
August, Whyte ordered Caltrans to submit a written clarification.</TE>
<TE>   "During the deposition, we have gotten wildly different stories
from Caltrans," said Nathan Benjamin, an attorney for the women.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the order, Caltrans Deputy District Director Steve
Price submitted a declaration on Sept. 5 stating that all Caltrans
district directors have been instructed "to comply with the
injunction by allowing banners and signs posted by private parties to
be displayed on highway overpasses so long as they do not pose a
safety risk."</TE>
<TE>   The declaration says American flags must be treated like all other
banners.</TE>
<TE>   Price said Caltrans workers will decide on a case-by-case basis
which banners, signs and flags must be removed because they are in
danger of coming loose and falling on passing motorists.</TE>
<TE>   After the judge's ruling in January, Courtney said she and Brown
received many angry phone calls and letters from people who accused
them of being unpatriotic. But she said the two women have also
gained many supporters, who praise them as champions of the 1st
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney describes herself and Brown simply as "concerned
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   "I think we are speaking for a lot of people who are afraid to
speak up during a pretty repressive time," she said.</TE>

<HD>3 Children, Mother Die in Hit-Run</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A hit-and-run driver struck and killed three children and their
mother as they crossed a street in the Florence area Wednesday night,
then crashed his van into a tree and was caught by witnesses,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The crash occurred at 7:22 p.m. on Compton Avenue and East 70th
Street, said California Highway Patrol Officer Darren Wybenga.</LD>
<LD>   Eduardo Borrera said he "saw the man coming like 65 or 70 mph. He
hit them and just kept on going like he didn't care. He didn't even
make an attempt to stop."</LD>
<TE>   Authorities said the woman was 31, and her children were boys ages
2 and 3, and a 6-year-old girl. Two of them died at King/Drew Medical
Center.</TE>
<TE>   The driver, a 30-year-old, ran from his van after it crashed.
Witnesses caught him a few blocks away as he tried to place a call at
a telephone booth.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and children had been walking home from a clinic on
Florence Avenue and were in a crosswalk, Wybenga said. Witnesses told
authorities that two vehicles had stopped for them. Suddenly, the
driver barreled through, Wybenga said.</TE>
<TE>   "Witnesses said the other drivers honked their horns to get him to
stop," Wybenga said. "But he hit them. Their bodies were thrown a
good distance. The driver sped away."</TE>
<TE>   Wybenga said there was "no indication of pre-impact braking or
post-impact braking. He just drove right through."</TE>
<TE>   Witness Francisco Noriega said the driver dragged the victims 20
or 30 feet "and kept going."</TE>
<TE>   The children's 27-year-old father arrived later and identified the
bodies of his family.</TE>
<TE>   The unidentified driver was being investigated for driving under
the influence, Wybenga said.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents said they have long complained about reckless
drivers on dimly lighted Compton Avenue, which is in an
unincorporated county area just south of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a freeway here. People don't care," said Leticia
Valenzuela, 32.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Jones, who lives near the scene, said there "are a lot of
blind spots on this street. People park their trucks up and down the
avenue, and then people walk in between them to cross the street, but
you can't see them."</TE>

<HD>Influential Doctor Accused in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Medicine: State seeks action against AIDS activist R. Scott
Hitt, saying he molested two patients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. R. Scott Hitt, a prominent AIDS specialist, gay activist and
former chairman of the Presidential Advisory Council on AIDS and HIV,
has been accused by state regulators of sexually molesting two
patients at a Beverly Hills medical office.</LD>
<LD>   Hitt, the first openly gay person to head a presidential advisory
body, acknowledged having touched one patient's genitalia in August
2000 and "crossing a boundary" with one other patient in July of that
year, according to a formal accusation filed by the Medical Board of
California, which regulates physicians.</LD>
<LD>   Both alleged molestations occurred at the Pacific Oaks Medical
Group in Beverly Hills, one of the nation's largest private AIDS
practices.</LD>
<TE>   The accusation asks that Hitt's medical license be revoked or
suspended or that other actions be taken as deemed appropriate by the
board.</TE>
<TE>   In the accusation, the state medical board said that Hitt, 43,
made his admissions after a complaint was filed about the August 2000
incident. It was not clear who complained.</TE>
<TE>   Hitt said the patient in the July incident "started to come on" to
him, according to the accusation. The patients, both male, are not
named in the accusation.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday, Hitt acknowledged doing "things I
regret" while under physical and psychological stress brought on by a
battle with cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "In July of 1999, my life fell apart. I was diagnosed with
metastatic colon cancer. My odds of recovery were very slim," Hitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   While undergoing three surgeries in 45 days as well as
chemotherapy, he said, "my judgment was impaired."</TE>
<TE>   The cancer is now in remission, he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the incidents two years ago, he said, he left his practice
and checked into a "rehabilitation and recovery program," which he
declined to describe further. "I am proud of the progress of that
recovery since then. I have not seen any patients since the
accusation was made."</TE>
<TE>   Hitt practiced internal medicine and was a partner at Pacific Oaks
until his resignation in 2000. Since then, he has been serving as
president of the American Academy of HIV Medicine, an independent
organization of HIV specialists.</TE>
<TE>   The medical board charges that Hitt's behavior was "grossly
negligent," that he was incompetent in his care and treatment of the
two patients, and that he committed "dishonest and corrupt acts."</TE>
<TE>   "The accusation speaks for itself," said Henry Fenton, the Los
Angeles attorney who represents the Pacific Oaks medical practice.
"This is a very sad story. The biggest concern is the former
patients."</TE>
<TE>   Fenton said that "as soon as suspicion arose with Dr. Hitt, he
agreed to stop seeing any patients at Pacific Oaks and the practice
conducted its own investigation. At the conclusion of the
investigation, he resigned and the fruits of the investigation were
turned over by Pacific Oaks to the medical board."</TE>
<TE>   In such cases, doctors can either agree to some type of discipline
or take the case to a hearing before an administrative law judge. The
judge makes a recommendation on the case, but the final disciplinary
action, if any, is decided by the medical board.</TE>
<TE>   Active in politics at the local and national levels, Hitt was an
ardent supporter of Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, Clinton named Hitt to head the influential AIDS
panel, a 30-member body intended to advise the president on how to
fight the epidemic. Within Hitt's first six weeks at the helm, the
council issued eight recommendations that Clinton immediately put
into effect, including convening a White House conference on the
deadly disorder.</TE>
<TE>   But, according to Michael Weinstein, head of the Los Angeles-based
AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the largest HIV medical provider in the
U.S., even as a Clinton appointee, Hitt "nevertheless was quite
critical" of the president on issues of needle exchange and HIV
prevention. "He certainly didn't rubber-stamp Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the panel questioned the Clinton administration's
commitment to fighting AIDS and said that the federal-state Medicaid
program wasn't doing enough to cover all poor people with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1998 resolution, the panel said the administration should
back the use of federal funds to provide addicts with clean needles.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's refusal to do so "threatens the public
health, and directly contradicts current scientific evidence," the
panel said.</TE>
<TE>   Hitt stepped down in 1999 because of his illness.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said he was saddened to hear of Hitt's current
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be tragic if it undid all of the good work that he's
done."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein also praised Hitt's continued work with the American
Academy of HIV Medicine, where "he is championing a very important
issue, which is that HIV patients can see qualified providers."</TE>
<TE>   Others who know Hitt expressed sadness as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a terrible shame if this is what he is remembered
for," said Martin Delaney, the founder of Project Inform in San
Francisco, a nationally known AIDS treatment information and advocacy
agency. "Whatever misdeeds he committed have to be weighed against
the good that he has done and continues to do. He's an important
member of our community."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the medical board investigated a complaint alleging that
Hitt breached patient confidentiality by telephoning a colleague's
patient to seek support for a political candidate. The board
eventually cleared him of any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Tucson, Hitt graduated from the University of Arizona
School of Medicine. He came to Los Angeles for his medical residency
and joined Pacific Oaks in 1988.</TE>

<HD>Davis Signs Bill to Help Patients With HIV</HD>
<DH>Health: Uninsured people not yet disabled by AIDS will
qualify for government-funded care starting in 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Uninsured Californians infected with HIV but not yet disabled by
full-blown AIDS will be eligible for government-funded health care
under a bill signed by Gov. Gray Davis on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hailed by AIDS activists as the state's most significant
AIDS-related legislation in a decade, the law is expected to fund
treatment for hundreds of HIV-positive patients beginning in 2003, at
no direct cost to taxpayers.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a momentous day in the long battle for access to quality
HIV care," said Michael Weinstein, executive director of the AIDS
Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Weinstein said the law, which awards HIV-positive patients
coverage under the federal and state Medi-Cal program for the poor,
will improve the lives of the infected and ultimately save money by
providing them early care.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Davis agreed: "It's high time that our Medi-Cal
system met the needs of those living with HIV."</TE>
<TE>   Davis predicted that the law would "extend the lives and
productivity of thousands of Californians."</TE>
<TE>   Carried by Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood), the bill,
AB 2197, was approved with bipartisan support and faced no organized
opposition. It was the third time in five years that advocates tried
to pass such legislation in California.</TE>
<TE>   Koretz said the law would create no new costs for
taxpayers--because of an unusual, offsetting funding mechanism--while
getting patients treatment early, "rather than just waiting for
symptoms to occur."</TE>
<TE>   Though the number of AIDS cases in California continues to decline
because of increasingly effective drugs, the number of new HIV
infections is rising, in part because AIDS is no longer viewed as an
automatic death sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill said that trend makes early treatment of
the virus all the more essential to help break the chain of
infection.</TE>
<TE>   If they lack insurance through an employer or other program,
people with HIV typically go without health care or struggle to
obtain help from a patchwork of community organizations.</TE>
<TE>   HIV-positive patients with annual incomes under $50,000 are
eligible for some government-funded medications. But they can only
receive care under Medi-Cal if they have full-blown AIDS and are
considered disabled under the law. In essence, that means that they
must get sicker to win access to regular treatment.</TE>
<TE>   To put the Koretz bill into practice, the state must first win a
waiver from the federal government, which jointly funds the Medi-Cal
program and specifies that any expansion of beneficiaries must not
result in new costs.</TE>
<TE>   To meet that requirement, the bill proposes shifting patients with
full-blown AIDS from one category of Medi-Cal
coverage--fee-for-service--into the Medi-Cal managed-care program,
which costs the state less. Money saved from that shift, which is
voluntary, will finance care for the newly eligible HIV patients.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said the first HIV-positive patients likely to enroll in
the program would come from a group of 10,000 who now receive
government-funded medications. He said he expects about 2,500
patients to be phased into the program in the first year, with each
case costing Medi-Cal about $6,200. That cost, according to the bill,
would be offset by savings accrued from AIDS patients shifting into
managed care. A legislative analysis of the bill said it would take
18 or 19 transfers to managed care to offset the cost of enrolling
one newly eligible person in Medi-Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Some AIDS activists question whether HIV patients will want to
make that shift, because in many cases it would require them to
change doctors and receive a lower level of benefits. State officials
plan to run an outreach campaign urging patients to join managed
care.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the bill, but we don't necessarily believe that the
[funding] scheme it contains is the most desirable," said Dana Van
Gorder, director of state and local affairs at the San Francisco AIDS
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Though the governor won widespread praise for signing the Koretz
bill, Van Gorder and other AIDS activists said that another important
measure remains on his desk. That bill, SB 1785, would permit adults
to buy syringes from licensed pharmacies without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   California is one of only six states that restrict pharmacy access
to syringes, and health-care providers said that lifting that ban
could help curb the spread of AIDS and hepatitis C among injection
drug users.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to remind the governor that this is sound public
health policy and that we hope he'll make a decision based on that,
not on the misbelief that this creates more crime or drug use," said
Van Gorder. "It's time for California to enter the modern age."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, carried by state Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara),
is supported by the California Medical Assn. and the California
Nurses Assn., among other groups. But it is opposed by four law
enforcement organizations and is considered a sensitive issue for
Davis in an election year. Eric Bauman, special assistant to the
governor, said Wednesday that Davis has not yet taken a position on
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   In other action Wednesday, Davis signed:</TE>
<TE>   * Legislation aimed at restricting Internet sales of cigarettes to
minors and sales of smuggled cigarettes. One bill, AB 2205 by Koretz,
doubles potential fines to $200 per carton for possession of
cigarettes that don't have proper tax stamps. Another measure, AB
1830 by Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Feliz), requires that
Internet vendors verify the ages of customers to ensure they are not
minors.</TE>
<TE>   * SB 1011, by Sen. Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), which is designed to
keep household hazardous wastes such as paint, used oil and
antifreeze out of landfills by allowing companies to pick them up at
the curb.</TE>

<HD>Fatal Beating Case Ends in Mistrial for a 2nd Time</HD>
<DH>Court: Four months after first hung jury, panel deadlocks
on whether former gang member took part in '99 slaying in Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a second time, a mistrial has been declared in the case of a
former gang member accused of participating in the September 1999
beating death of an 18-year-old man outside his Ventura apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated five days before indicating Wednesday that they
were hopelessly deadlocked on whether Ramiro Salgado, 23, was guilty
of second-degree murder for allegedly kicking and striking William
Zara.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr.
declared a mistrial after jurors said that further deliberations
would not help.</LD>
<TE>   "This outcome sends its own message about the case and whether it
can be proven," the judge said afterward. "You're a second jury that
has reached a similar result in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Four months ago, O'Neill declared a mistrial after jurors voted 9
to 3 for Salgado's acquittal. This time, the panel was divided 10 to
2, with the majority voting for acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors hearing the second trial said the split had been the same
for two days. And, as was the case in the first jury, the dispute
centered on Salgado's statements to police indicating he had
participated in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   During a tape-recorded interview with investigators, Salgado
admitted stomping Zara as the teen tried to shield himself from gang
members who suspected him and his friends of reporting their noisy
party to police.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's mistrial, three jurors said the panel could not
agree on whether Salgado was telling the truth or telling
investigators what he thought they wanted to hear. The jurors said
the panel listened to the taped interview and pored over the
transcript but could not reach consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "There just wasn't enough evidence against him," said one juror,
who declined to give his name. All three jurors said they doubted the
case could ever be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors now must decide whether to try the case for a third
time.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin Drescher, who did not prosecute the case
but represented his office in court Wednesday, requested that Salgado
remain in jail for two weeks while prosecutors discuss a possible
retrial.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Richard Loftus angrily objected and asked O'Neill to
immediately dismiss the case and release his client, who has spent
the last two years behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   "The people have had two bites at the apple," Loftus said. "There
is no apple left."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill agreed that two weeks was too long and set a hearing for
Monday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   As he left the courtroom Wednesday, Salgado smiled and walked
arm-in-arm with Loftus to a nearby holding cell. Salgado remains
jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, half a dozen relatives of Salgado held each
other and cried.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I can speak for all of us and say we are very happy,"
said Ventura resident Virginia Arroyo, the defendant's aunt and
godmother. "It was obvious that he was innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo said she hopes her nephew will be released next week but
said she remains concerned prosecutors will try to put the case
before a third jury.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney apparently does not want to let go," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   No relatives of the victim were present in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado is the fifth and final defendant to stand trial in the
slaying of Zara, a Ventura Theater stagehand who was beaten, kicked
and stabbed by as many as 15 assailants the night of Sept. 25, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, a fight began when associates of a
west Ventura gang confronted Zara's neighbors and accused them of
calling police to report their party on East Warner Street.</TE>
<TE>   A fight ensued and when Zara stepped out on his porch with a
baseball bat, a gang member took the bat from him and struck him on
the head. Another attacker then beat Zara with a shovel, according to
the testimony.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes the attackers fled and police arrived to find Zara
lying in his own blood. He later died from his injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Four others were convicted last year of murder in connection with
the attack. They are all serving life prison sentences.</TE>

<HD>Simon Lends $4 Million to Campaign</HD>
<DH>Politics: Transfusion to restart TV ads draws criticism,
since candidate probably would be repaid after the election by money
from donors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>With almost no money left to buy television ads, Republican Bill
Simon Jr. this week lent $4 million to his campaign for governor,
according to the candidate and finance reports filed by his campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The loan could help Simon revive a campaign that has struggled to
raise enough to counter a three-month onslaught of attack ads by his
Democratic rival, Gov. Gray Davis.</LD>
<LD>   But the money also drew criticism from government ethics
watchdogs, who questioned Simon's decision to supply the $4 million
in the form of a loan. If Simon is elected governor, they said, his
campaign would probably repay him with money given by donors whose
contributions would go directly into the personal fortune of the
governor.</LD>
<TE>   "That's money that goes right into the candidate's pocket," said
Jim Knox, executive director of California Common Cause. Moreover,
Knox said, voters would learn some donors' names only after the
election, when they could contribute to the incumbent to help him pay
off his debt to himself.</TE>
<TE>   Simon explained why he lent the money instead of donating it after
a speech on energy Wednesday in Sacramento. "It just preserves the
possibility of repayment," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon is also awaiting repayment of $5 million that he lent his
campaign during the GOP primary. When asked if he might wind up
collecting personal loan repayments from donors with an interest in
state policy, Simon shifted the focus to Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "When you raise money, you've got to be careful, whether it's a
loan or some other capacity, and Gray Davis has shown definitively
that there's a pattern between his fund-raising and his public
policy," Simon said. "I don't think it has anything to do with
whether or not it's a loan. It has to do with the type of leader you
are."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly every day on the stump, Simon accuses Davis of trading
state favors for donations. On Wednesday, he called Davis "shameless"
for accepting $25,000 last week from Mercury Insurance Group at a
time when the company is seeking his signature on an auto-policy bill
passed by the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there no end to the brazenness?" Simon asked in a Modesto
radio interview.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to lend his campaign the money needed to revitalize
its advertising budget subjected Simon to similar criticism, however,
as campaign finance experts questioned how and when Simon might be
repaid.</TE>
<TE>   "If Simon wins, we won't know who the contributors are until after
the election--and then he puts it in his pocket," said Robert M.
Stern, one of the authors of California's 1974 Political Reform Act
and president of the Center for Governmental Studies, a nonpartisan
group that advocates campaign finance reform. "That's an even worse
form of campaign money. He's benefiting personally."</TE>
<TE>   A new California law would have capped Simon's loans at $100,000,
but it will not take effect until after the election, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   Since Simon's surprise victory in the March 5 primary, he has
faced staff turmoil, a fraud verdict against his family investment
firm and other stumbles. Although the campaign benefited last week
from a judge's decision to overturn the fraud verdict, it continues
to face troubles raising money.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Simon told reporters that he has been "swamped with
calls" from donors since a judge overturned the fraud verdict last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, Simon ran a new TV spot with testimonials from
President Bush and former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
But the Davis campaign, which has tracked Simon's ads, found that
Simon's advertising came to an abrupt halt Sunday night--a report
undisputed by the Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar dismissed Simon's
$4-million loan as "enough to keep his campaign on life support for
the time being." Simon, however, described it as "a very significant
investment."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it sends a message to people: we're going to run a good,
strong, credible campaign, from now to Nov. 5," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon hammered Davis for his handling of the state energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "His reaction was typical of a failed career politician," said
Simon, a first-time candidate. "He sought to blame others for his
mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said Davis had used out-of-state power suppliers, Bush and
federal regulators as "boogeymen" on energy.</TE>
<TE>   Salazar said the governor had stabilized energy markets, brought
new power plants on line, fostered conservation and largely avoided
blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon has absolutely no idea what he's talking about when it
comes to energy," Salazar said.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech to a Sacramento business group, Simon said that
reports of market manipulation by power suppliers tell just "a small
part of the story."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," he continued, "it does appear that maybe some power
companies may have gamed the system, and I have a strong message for
those companies that did: I am a former federal prosecutor who took
on corporate wrongdoers. And if you try to rip off California on my
watch, you'll be punished to the fullest extent of the law."</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his aides also expanded on his earlier proposals to
increase the state's supply of electricity. Aides said he would
encourage utilities to sell their power transmission lines to
companies more likely to expand capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also proposed creating a nonprofit corporation to oversee
the expenditure of roughly $62 million in state money for energy
research and development.</TE>

<HD>Activist Sees New City as Fresh Start for Pets</HD>
<DH>Animals: Valley could 'certainly do better' than L.A.
agency, newsletter says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the contending calculations in the San Fernando Valley secession
debate, Nancy Smith has marked a small territory as her own. While
others quarrel over how many millions in federal grant dollars City
Hall has denied the Valley over the years, and whether a new Valley
city could afford the $1.3 billion in "alimony" it would owe Los
Angeles, Smith sticks to small integers.</LD>
<LD>   Secession, she believes, will benefit not only human residents of
the Valley, but their four-legged and feathered companions as well.</LD>
<LD>   Smith is co-owner of the California Cat Center, a luxury feline
boarding facility in Van Nuys, and editor of a newsletter called the
Valley Pet News. In a recent editorial, she sounded a call for Valley
independence, declaring that residents "can create a new
consciousness and set a new standard for the way animals are handled
in our new city."</LD>
<TE>   Cities' animal euthanasia performances vary widely, depending on
their education, adoption, and sterilization programs.</TE>
<TE>   In the editorial, Smith charged that the Los Angeles Animal
Services Department uses killing "as a management tool. Our new
Valley city can certainly do better than killing nearly 75% of the
pets turned into the Los Angeles-run shelters."</TE>
<TE>   Smith's kill figure is a little dated and somewhat inflated. While
L.A. Animal Services' "kill rate" hit 72% in fiscal 1999-2000, when
the department euthanized 53,445 animals, it dipped to 61% the next
year. Final figures have not been tabulated for fiscal 2001-02 or the
current year, but the department estimates the kill rate will drop to
57% and 51%, respectively, thanks to stepped-up sterilization and
other programs.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper Animal People, which tabulates cities' animal
euthanasia rates per 1,000 human population, places Los Angeles, with
a score of 14.4, below the national average of 15.7. Animal People's
editor, Merritt Clifton, said the Los Angeles figures include the
entire county.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith, a 51-year-old lawyer and former journalist who wears
work smocks depicting smiling cartoon cats, has a brawling mouser's
attitude when it comes to her profound love of animals. L.A.'s
progress, she said, is laudable, but not good enough.</TE>
<TE>   She pointed to San Francisco as an example. There, close
cooperation between the city's department of Animal Care and Control
and the local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has
lowered the kill rate for impounded cats and dogs to 28% (San
Francisco holds first place among cities in Animal People's
tabulation, with a score of 2.6).</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, Smith visited Los Angeles' East Valley animal
shelter in Van Nuys. She walked between rows of kennels, pausing to
greet the barking, yelping occupants affectionately. She made her way
to the cat room, where various felines pawed through cage bars at her
extended fingers.</TE>
<TE>   The place was tidy, if utilitarian. Cats were housed one to a
cage, but dogs two to a kennel.</TE>
<TE>   "The way you increase adoptions," Smith said as she piloted her
California Cat Center van east toward Pasadena, "is to mimic retail,
and that place, while not hideous and reasonably clean, looks more
like a doggy jail than a pet store."</TE>
<TE>   The Pasadena Humane Society shelter provided a sharp contrast. The
society, which is more than a century old, handles animal control for
Pasadena, La Canada-Flintridge, South Pasadena, San Marino, Sierra
Madre and Arcadia--cities with a combined population of 400,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pasadena shelter, dogs are one to a kennel in spotless
outdoor enclosures provided with sun-dappling shade, radiant heat for
cool nights, drop-down roofs for rain and misters for hot days. In
the cat room, animals are one to a cage and breathe filtered air that
replaces itself 12 times a minute to cut down on the respiratory
diseases to which cats are prone. A separate, locked facility, dimly
lighted and quiet, houses feral cats, which are dangerous and easily
spooked.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the shelter euthanized fewer than 10% of the 3,537 dogs
it impounded, said the Humane Society public relations director,
Ricky Whitman. The figure was much higher for cats--58% of 3,193.
That is because the shelter takes in large numbers of newborn
kittens, which cannot be hand-nurtured without placing an
unjustifiable burden on resources, and also impounds sizable numbers
of unadoptable feral cats.</TE>
<TE>   For dogs and cats combined, the kill rate last year was 33%,
somewhat more than half that of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Whitman said the Pasadena shelter's aggressive education, adoption
and spaying/neutering campaigns have begun paying unheard-of
dividends. The shelter did not euthanize a single adoptable dog or
cat this past March, April or May.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives me chills even talking about it," she said. In its long
history, it had never before had a "no-kill" month.</TE>
<TE>   Driving back to Van Nuys, Smith imagined a similar cutting-edge
animal services department for a new Valley city, perhaps one that
out-sources some functions to dedicated nonprofit organizations, such
as the Pasadena Humane society, gives incentives for people to
sterilize pets, provides grants to dog trainers to provide free
classes to citizens, and works toward a no-kill goal.</TE>
<TE>   A citywide proposition approved in November 2000 provides for
expansion and renovation of two of L.A.'s six animal shelters,
replacement of three others and construction of two new ones, all
with the expressed goal of remaking the facilities along the lines of
shelters like Pasadena's.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has charged, however, that the Los Angeles Animal Services
Department is a hopeless victim of cumbersome size and arthritic
bureaucracy. None of the new and refashioned shelters has yet been
built. Moreover, she said, the ballot measure did not provide for
more staff, "and the department is always complaining, 'We're
understaffed. We're understaffed.' Is it going to be twice as big and
twice as badly managed?"</TE>
<TE>   When she opened California Cat Center two years ago, Smith
contacted Animal Services about being inspected, as the law requires.
She's still waiting for an inspector to show up.</TE>
<TE>   "The smaller size of a Valley city would give us the opportunity
to have better management, where you could do something like they've
done in San Francisco," she said. "We have the opportunity to
wholesale make over our rules, to rewrite the city code. Trying to do
that in the city of L.A. would be like hitting your head against a
wall."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the allure of wiping the slate clean and starting
anew--a prospect that appeals to secessionists of many stripes--Smith
said she believed that Valley residents, who tend to be middle-class
and family-oriented, are particularly sensitive to the needs of pets
and other animals. Most of Los Angeles' animal welfare organizations,

<HD>Power Loss for Angels</HD>
<DH>Baseball: A's hit four home runs, three in decisive fourth
inning, in 7-4 victory to forge another tie for first in AL West.
Zito wins his 22nd game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>In the regular season, there will be no game more important for the
Angels than today's. If the Angels and Oakland Athletics tie for the
American League West championship, today's result could well
determine the division title.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels and A's are counting the days until they clinch a
playoff berth, but the critical question of which team wins the
division and which receives the wild-card playoff entry could be
settled today. That's why, for instance, the Angels are prepared to
use closer Troy Percival before the ninth inning today.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels and A's are tied again atop the AL West after Oakland
hit four home runs and Cy Young Award hopeful Barry Zito won his 22nd
game in a 7-4 victory Wednesday before a sellout crowd of 50,730. The
A's lead the season series, 10-9, the most important statistic of the
day.</LD>
<TE>   Because both teams are bound for postseason play--the magic number
for each to clinch a playoff berth is four--there would be no extra
game to settle a tie between the Angels and A's. The first tiebreaker
is head-to-head record, a category the A's would win with a victory
today.</TE>
<TE>   If the Angels win, the season series would be tied, 10-10. The
next tiebreaker is record within the division, and a victory today
would give the Angels a three-game lead in that category, with nine
to play.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the AL West draws home-field advantage in the first
round of the playoffs and gets the Minnesota Twins. The team that
loses out on the division title also loses out on home-field
advantage and faces the playoff-tested New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   So long as the playoff picture remains clouded, Mickey Callaway is
not scheduled to make another start this season. The Angels plan to
skip his next start and, if the final two games matter, to use Kevin
Appier and Ramon Ortiz on three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway could make the playoff roster as a long reliever,
although Wednesday's performance did little to help his cause.</TE>
<TE>   "If I do my job, I might have a chance," he said. "If I keep on
pitching the way I have the last two games, it's not going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Callaway, brilliant in his first three starts since replacing the
injured Aaron Sele in the rotation, has failed to survive the fourth
inning of successive starts against the A's.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway (1-1) took a 4-1 lead into the fourth inning, the one run
for Oakland a homer by Mark Ellis in the second.</TE>
<TE>   But the A's scored six runs in the fourth, an outburst that
featured solo homers from Eric Chavez and Jermaine Dye and a
three-run homer from Ray Durham.</TE>
<TE>   Zito (22-5) had wobbled through the first four innings, walking at
least one batter in each inning. But, revitalized by the rally, he
got four more outs and took home another victory. No Oakland pitcher
has won more games in a season since Bob Welch won 27, and the Cy
Young Award, in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Rodriguez, the Angels' Venezuelan prodigy, made his
major league debut and pitched a scoreless eighth inning, striking
out two, with a fastball consistently timed at 95 mph and a fine
slider at 83 mph. Rodriguez, 20, could develop into the setup man for
Percival as soon as next season in the same way Percival broke into
the major leagues as the setup man for Lee Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, in a questionable move, used two
pinch-hitters in the eighth inning but failed to bat for backup
catcher Jose Molina. Orlando Palmeiro batted for Shawn Wooten, and
Adam Kennedy for Benji Gil, but Scioscia opted not to use Brad
Fullmer for Molina, trailing by three runs and with one man on base.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he wanted to save Fullmer in case he could be used
later, representing the tying run. Scioscia also said he feared the
A's would counter the left-handed Fullmer with left-hander Ricardo
Rincon but noted he could have then responded with Alex Ochoa.</TE>
<TE>   Molina struck out and is hitless in his last 20 at-bats, with one
hit in his last 27.</TE>

<HD>Carson Gets 2006 Track World Cup</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 2006 World Cup of track and field will be held at the Home Depot
National Training Center in Carson, the first time the prestigious
event will be held in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Lamine Diack, president of the International Assn. of Athletics
Federations, will announce today in Madrid--site of this year's World
Cup--that the complex at Cal State Dominguez Hills will play host to
the four-day event over the Labor Day weekend of 2006. The World Cup,
a team-scoring competition, is held every four years.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a great concept, and sort of a shame it's never been held in
the U.S. before because our team is so strong," said Bill Peterson,
senior vice president of events for Anschutz Entertainment Group,
developer and operator of the $130-million complex.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great fit with what we're trying to do with track and
field in L.A. and at the Home Depot Training Center."</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup will be the first major IAAF event in the U.S. since
the 1991 World Cross-Country Championships in Boston. More than 500
athletes are expected to compete, and the event will be broadcast to
more than 100 countries. The track and field stadium was planned to
seat 10,000, with the potential to expand to 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   The complex is scheduled to open next June. Soon after, it will be
the site of a meet on USA Track and Field's Golden Spike tour.
Olympic pole vault gold medalist Stacy Dragila has committed to that
event, as have Sydney Olympic gold medalists Marion Jones and Maurice
Greene.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson hopes to lure Tim Montgomery, who set a world record of
9.78 seconds in the 100 meters Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   AEG's plans include bringing the 2005 U.S. track and field
championships to the complex.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a good shot at that," Peterson said Wednesday
from Madrid. "We're also looking at other things on the grass roots
level."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery won't run the 100 today at Madrid because his legs are
too sore from last weekend. However, he might run a relay leg if
needed.</TE>

<HD>Kretschmer Out for Season</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nevada running back Chance Kretschmer, who led the NCAA in rushing
last season, suffered a season-ending knee injury Saturday against
Brigham Young and has surgery scheduled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Kretschmer tore his anterior cruciate ligament on his first carry
against BYU when he was hit late out of bounds by two defenders. The
Cougars were called for a 15-yard personal foul. The play was one
part of what Nevada players and coaches said was a dirty game.</LD>
<LD>   "I'll just say this, I can only coach my team, but I'll tell you
what, that shot on Chance Kretschmer was three yards out of bounds
and was uncalled for," Nevada Coach Chris Tormey said.</LD>
<TE>   Kretschmer, a sophomore, is not eligible for a medical redshirt
this season from the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming linebacker Jon Aimone's playing career is over after he
suffered the latest in a series of neck stingers in Saturday's loss
against Boise State. Doctors said Aimone would risk permanent damage
if he were to play again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma backup quarterback Brent Rawls, already sidelined because
of a thumb injury, could be out for six weeks because of a
concussion. Rawls was hurt when he fell out of the back of a pickup
truck last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Monroe Coach Bobby Keasler resigned after starting his
fourth season 0-3. Keasler went 8-28 with the Indians, who have not
had a winning season since moving to Division I-A in 1994. Defensive
coordinator Mike Collins was named the interim coach.... Auburn will
play its fourth game in 18 days tonight when it travels to
Starkville, Miss., to play Mississippi State in a Southeastern
Conference game. The game will also be a test of a new conference
rule--thought to be directed toward Bulldog fans--against artificial
noisemakers. Bulldog fans traditionally ring cowbells throughout a
game. Officials have been instructed to penalize the home team five
yards for the first infraction and 15 yards for each additional
offense.</TE>

<HD>Two Giant Steps Back</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Ortiz goes six innings and hits the go-ahead home
run as San Francisco increases lead with 7-4 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All this obsessing over San Francisco slugger Barry Bonds, and the
Dodgers get beat by a long ball delivered by a .243 hitter who now
has all of four career home runs. And who happens to be a pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers avoided Bonds like a vampire avoids sunlight, walking
him three times in five plate appearances Wednesday night, but
perhaps they should have paid closer attention to pitcher Russ Ortiz,
who sank a dagger deep into the Dodgers' playoff hopes.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings but made
just as big a contribution with his bat, snapping a sixth-inning tie
with a home run after getting a sacrifice fly in the second to key
the Giants' 7-4 victory over the Dodgers before 40,164 in Dodger
Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   The win, San Francisco's second in a row after losing the opener
of a crucial four-game series, gave the Giants a two-game lead over
the Dodgers in the National League wild-card race with 10 games
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   It also backed the Dodgers in a virtual must-win situation
tonight, when left-hander Odalis Perez will oppose Giant right-hander
Livan Hernandez in the series finale and the final regular-season
meeting between the teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's pretty important that we win [tonight's] game,"
Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "But when you say 'must win,' you're
saying win or you're completely done, and that's not the case. You
dig a much deeper hole if they win the game, but does it mean you're
eliminated? No. Momentum is a word you use a lot in a series like
this. [Tonight] is a huge game for us, and it's a huge game for the
Giants."</TE>
<TE>   As they did in the ninth inning of Tuesday's 6-4 win, the Giants
tacked on a huge insurance run Wednesday night when Kenny Lofton
singled with two out in the eighth, stole second and scored on Rich
Aurilia's single for a 5-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   They appeared to blow the game open on RBI singles by David Bell
and Shawon Dunston in the ninth for a 7-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers rallied in the ninth off closer Robb Nen, trimming the
lead to 7-4 when Dave Roberts scored on Brian Jordan's infield
single. That brought Eric Karros to the plate with runners on first
and second and a chance to tie the game with a home run.</TE>
<TE>   But Karros, who had nine hits, including one home run, in 20
career at-bats against Nen, struck out swinging to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Is [the pressure on us tonight]? A little bit," third baseman
Adrian Beltre said. "We have to forget about [Wednesday night] and we
have to win [tonight]. The season isn't over, but it isn't much
longer."</TE>
<TE>   Karros had come up big in the fifth inning, lining an RBI single
to left-center to tie the score, 3-3. But in the top of the sixth,
Ortiz lined a 1-and-1 pitch from reliever Robert Ellis into the
left-field pavilion for his second home run of this season, both
coming against the Dodgers. Ortiz homered off Terry Mulholland on
April 3.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Ellis, who previously appeared in only two big
league games this season, was even in a game of such magnitude is a
reflection of the sorry state of the Dodger pitching staff, which is
hobbling toward the final week of the season with an injury-plagued
rotation and a fatigued bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to single that out," Tracy said of Ellis giving up
the home run. "Barry didn't do anything tonight. I answer Barry Bonds
questions every day. They scored seven runs, and Barry hit a soft
single to left field [in the ninth]. They've got a pretty good club.
They've got other weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger starter Kevin Beirne needed 93 pitches to get through four
innings, and of the 23 batters he faced, 12 reached base. But the
right-hander, in only his third big league start, somehow managed to
keep the Dodgers in the game despite giving up five hits and walking
six.</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow's RBI double and Ortiz's sacrifice fly gave the Giants a
2-0 lead in the second, but the Dodgers countered in the bottom of
the second with home runs by Beltre, his 21st, and Alex Cora, his
fourth, for a 2-2 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Beirne's biggest mistake was grooving a belt-high, 0-and-2
fastball to Jeff Kent, who drove it over the left-field wall for his
36th homer to lead off the third for a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers squandered opportunities in the fourth, when they
failed to score after Beltre's leadoff double, and the fifth, when
they had runners on first and third with one out after Karros' RBI
single.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's rookie game between the Mighty Ducks and Kings may be the
first step in a larger agreement, as officials from those two teams,
the San Jose Sharks and Phoenix Coyotes are discussing holding a
rookie tournament next season.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks and Kings skate today at the Arrowhead Pond in a 1 p.m.
game. Admission is free. Stanislav Chistov, Alexei Smirnov and Ilja
Bryzgalov--three of the Ducks' top prospects--will participate. The
Kings' lineup will include Michael Cammalleri, Yanick Lehoux and
Jared Aulin.</LD>
<LD>   "This gives us a better chance to evaluate our players," Duck
General Manager Bryan Murray said. "We'll see where this goes. We've
talked about having a bigger event with those other teams and
everyone seems to want to try it."</LD>
<TE>   The tournament would begin next year, possibly in Scottsdale,
Ariz., as Coyote officials have indicated they would like to play
host to the first one. The tournament probably will rotate between
cities after that.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be interested as long as it would be done the right way,"
King Coach Andy Murray said. "We have a pretty good rookie camp here
in July that has created a lot interest.... I would rather have the
kids around [veterans] for 10 days like we do. I think the way we do
it is pretty good, but if they have a little tournament, say at the
end of the first week of camp, that would be fine. Some of these
rookie things can get to be pretty goofy."</TE>
<TE>   Today's game between the Ducks and Kings will be played without
fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the only way you can play that kind of a game," Andy
Murray said. "Otherwise these kids are going to pound on each other.
We want to see who can play the game. There's no sense in them
fighting. We know who's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Still, tough guys Kip Brennan (Kings) and Cam Severson (Ducks)
will play, even if on-ice shenanigans are not allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys will do anything to make a hockey team," Bryan Murray said.
"If we let them fight, then guys are going to go out and do that to
try to catch management's eye."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks also are exploring moving a portion of their training
camp out of Anaheim next season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have canceled Saturday night's intrasquad game.</TE>
<TE>   "With the addition of the rookie game [today against the Ducks],
we thought we were overloading our guys a little bit," Andy Murray
said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran left wing Denny Lambert, placed in the minor league
practice group this week, scored two goals in the Ducks' scrimmage
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to do something," said Lambert, who was upset Monday to
learn he wasn't with the NHL team for practice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joffrey Lupul, the Ducks' No. 1 draft pick in June, was cleared to
begin practicing Wednesday but was held out of contact drills. Lupul
said the "best-case scenario" would have him playing in Sunday's
exhibition game against the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who had a couple of shaky moments in
giving up three goals during Wednesday's scrimmage, will start in
goal against Minnesota Friday in the Ducks' first exhibition game.
Goalie Martin Gerber, a rookie from Switzerland, also will play.
Gerber is competing with Bryzgalov and J.F. Damphousse to be
Giguere's backup.</TE>

<LD>Suzy Whaley, a teaching pro in Connecticut who became the first woman
to qualify to play in a PGA Tour event, now must decide whether she
will follow the encouragement of the tour, her family and fellow
competitors and play in next summer's Greater Hartford Open.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to make up my mind for a while. I have until 2003,"
Whaley said Wednesday. "I need to be doing it for the right reasons
for me. When I play I want to be competitive. It would be an insult
for me to even think I could beat Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson."</LD>
<LD>   As one of two women in the 90-player, three-round Connecticut
sectional event, Whaley played a course 6,239 yards in length,
compared to 6,938 for the men. If she chooses to compete in next
summer's PGA event, she would receive no such advantage.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm worried about the yardage," Whaley, 35, said. "That would put
me at an unbelievable disadvantage. That's one of my biggest
concerns."</TE>

<HD>Europe Takes the First Solheim Shots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Next week, the Ryder Cup takes center stage, but this week it's the
female professionals who will be making the most noise at the Solheim
Cup.</LD>
<LD>   Europe won two years ago in the last meeting, 14 1/2-11 1/2, in
the rain at Loch Lomond in Scotland. It was Europe's second victory
in six matches, but the U.S. is 3-0 when hosting the event, and these
matches are being played at Interlachen Country Club in Edina, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   Janice Moodie of Scotland was 3-1 and Catrin Nilsmark was 3-0 in
the last Solheim Cup, but neither is playing on captain Dale Reid's
team. Annika Sorenstam, Helen Alfredsson and Laura Davies are
Europe's top three players.</LD>
<TE>   As for the U.S., Patty Sheehan is the captain of the 12-player
team led by Juli Inkster, Beth Daniel, Meg Mallon and Rosie Jones.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Solheim Cup has taken a wide lead over the Ryder Cup
in pre-match hoopla, thanks to Nilsmark's column posted on a Swedish
Web site that ripped Cristie Kerr, Michelle Redman and Laura Diaz.
Also, Reid has had to defend her decision not to select Scots Moodie
and Catriona Mathew and has been roundly criticized in some areas of
the European media--largely Scottish.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. team has been silent, at least so</TE>
<TE>   far.</TE>
<TE>   Augustagate</TE>
<TE>   Whether it happens remains to be seen, but if the National Council
of Women's Organizations does indeed back off and allow Augusta
National Golf Club some room to make a decision to invite women
members, it could be the perfect solution so both parties come out
looking good.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders believe that Martha Burk of the NCWO is going to have
trouble making headway pressuring CBS to drop its telecast of the
Masters, or with her probe into who pays membership dues, or with
asking players to take her side or by pressuring players' sponsors to
consider sitting out the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   From Ron Drapeau, chief of Callaway Golf: "Callaway Golf is one of
the biggest supporters of women's golf in the world. Martha Burk has
not contacted Callaway. We do not direct the professionals that
endorse our products as to which golf tournaments they enter."</TE>
<TE>   From Bob Wood, chief of Nike Golf: "Although we are not a sponsor
of the Masters, we look forward to the day that the doors to Augusta
National will be open to women. We acknowledge the legal right of any
private organization to determine its own rules. Nike Golf will
continue to stand behind its players who choose to play at the
Masters...."</TE>
<TE>   Then again, if this issue is still simmering by April's
tournament, the amount of interest by the mainstream media is going
to be off the charts and CBS may be squirming indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The NCWO has a chance to take the high road, herald its campaign a
success, then call on Hootie Johnson and his peers at Augusta
National to do the right thing. When it no longer appears any action
Johnson takes would be bowing to a pressure campaign, he saves face,
and chances are the club will move steadily toward admitting women,
although that's improbable before the 2003 Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Women's Point of View</TE>
<TE>   Some LPGA Tour players preparing for the Solheim Cup told the
Associated Press they think it's time Augusta opens up its membership
to women.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe we're still fighting this stuff--racism, gender
equality or whatever," Inkster said. "But that's life, I guess. It's
not going to change overnight, but hopefully, in the coming years, it
will change."</TE>
<TE>   Several players at this week's Solheim Cup said they have played
as guests at Augusta--"I was 10 over after six holes, do we need to
go on?" Sheehan said--and been treated well.</TE>
<TE>   But there's a difference between playing as a member and playing
as a guest.</TE>
<TE>   "I played earlier this year, I had a great time," Kelly Robbins
said. "Obviously, things have progressed quite a bit since then, as
far as what's taking place. I think it's a shame. I do."</TE>
<TE>   Said Davies: "All I have ever said is that if they're looking for
their first woman member, I would love to join."</TE>
<TE>   But Alfredsson said she thought it was "a ridiculous issue,
period."</TE>
<TE>   Trophy Time</TE>
<TE>   Last month, right after she won the U.S. Women's Amateur, Becky
Lucidi looked at the trophy and quickly scanned it for the names she
was looking for, and found Grace Park, Jill McGill and Inkster.</TE>
<TE>   "I know where they are now, what they're doing on the LPGA Tour,"
said Lucidi, "and I thought, 'That's where I want to be in a year or
two.' "</TE>
<TE>   Don't put it past the fifth-year USC senior from Poway, who turns
22 on Monday. After all, Lucidi had never won a collegiate event
until she defeated Brandi Jackson, 3 and 2, at Sleepy Hollow Country
Club in Scarborough, N.Y., to win the top women's amateur event in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I'm on top of it right now," Lucidi said. "It's the
tournament that every amateur wants to win and I still can't believe
I did it. It's the best first step I could take to become a
professional, with all the recognition and prestige that goes along
with it."</TE>
<TE>   It's probably going to be a different world now for Lucidi, who
plans to defend her title at next year's Amateur, then try her luck
at LPGA qualifying school.</TE>
<TE>   Lucidi, who builds her game around considerable putting skills,
models herself after Inkster, her favorite player.</TE>
<TE>   "Not just for how she plays, but for everything she does. She is a
complete person. Golf doesn't define her."</TE>
<TE>   Lucidi's parents, father Zip and mother Lisa, are building a horse
boarding facility in Poway. They aren't golfers, but brother Joey,
23, who played at San Jose State, got her rolling, along with an
uncle. Her other two brothers are Chris, 24, and Mike, 26.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having four dads, it's like having four best friends,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   At home, it gets crowded when everybody shows up and shares space
with the five family dogs--Sammy, Bailey, Hoser, Flash and Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   But even after her victory in the Amateur, Lucidi's status at home
hasn't changed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just one of the guys," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This Just In</TE>
<TE>   News item: Kinko's becomes the title sponsor of a Senior PGA Tour
event in Austin, Texas, and also is announced as the "Official
Doc Services Provider" for both the Senior PGA Tour and the PGA

<TE>   Reaction: Opening remains for "Official Toner Provider."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   At the $5-million American Express Championship this weekend at
Mount Juliet in Ireland, Tiger Woods is breaking out a new set of
forged irons by Nike.</TE>
<TE>   Woods already plays a Nike forged titanium driver and is now a
complete Nike guy, from headgear to clothing to footwear to clubs to
golf balls--everything except his Scotty Cameron putter.</TE>
<TE>   For the relatively new Nike Golf brand, having Tiger totally in
the bag is a huge boost.</TE>

<TE>   News item: Ford signs Phil Mickelson to an endorsement deal to

who endorses Cadillac, and Mark O'Meara, who endorses Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Why don't they just go ahead and play the thing in the
parking lot?</TE>
<TE>   Annika Update</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam's victory last week at the Safeway Classic in Beaverton,
Ore., was not only her eighth this year--which equals her total of
2001--but also pushed her over $2 million for the second consecutive
year (no one else has won $2 million) at $2,221,991. She leads Se Ri
Pak by more than $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   In her eight victories, Sorenstam is a combined 119 under par. If
she keeps it up, Sorenstam has a shot at breaking her LPGA scoring
record of 69.42 and win her fifth Vare Trophy. Her scoring average in
17 events is 68.89.</TE>
<TE>   Shoe News</TE>
<TE>   Those red shoes that Sorenstam made such a splash in when she won
the Nabisco Championship, then leaped into the pond at Mission Hills
in Rancho Mirage? They just keep on walking.</TE>
<TE>   Nike Golf designed three kinds of the same Verdana golf shoes for
the U.S. team to wear in this weekend's Solheim Cup--two of them in
red, white and blue.</TE>

<DH>In response to last season's death of a spectator, NHL
mandates the use of protective netting</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spectators attending NHL exhibition games tonight at Staples Center
and Friday night at the Arrowhead Pond will get their first look at
new protective netting behind the goals--a sad reminder of one of the
league's darkest hours.</LD>
<LD>   The black nylon mesh that will hang like a curtain above the
glass, shielding fans from pucks flying into the stands, is the
tragic legacy of a 13-year-old girl who was struck in the head by an
errant puck last March while attending a game at Columbus, Ohio, and
died two days later.</LD>
<LD>   The death of Brittanie Nichole Cecil, the first fan fatality in
the 85-year history of the NHL, sparked discussions about the safety
measures taken to protect spectators at sporting events.</LD>
<TE>   In June, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman responded to the tragedy by
mandating the installation of protective netting at all league
arenas, saying that if such protection had been in place last season
it would have prevented the puck that struck Cecil from sailing into
the stands at Nationwide Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Though he told reporters in Toronto that an independent study had
concluded that NHL buildings were safe for fans, Bettman said he
nevertheless felt compelled to act in the wake of such a horrific
accident. He also mandated that the protective glass on the sides of
NHL rinks be raised to at least five feet in height.</TE>
<TE>   "The accident in Columbus was tragic," he said. "And even though
Brittanie Cecil was the first fatality in the 85-year history of the
league, and probably 800 million fans have attended our games, we
still wanted the look of doing the right thing.</TE>
<TE>   "So we concluded on the basis of the report that there were
measures we could take that would reduce the incidence of pucks
entering the stands without it interfering with the game, or the
fans' enjoyment of the game."</TE>
<TE>   The netting, which will keep the six-ounce frozen rubber pucks out
of the seats behind the nets and in the corners, will extend across
each end of the rink from points about 10 feet farther out toward
center ice from where the red goal lines meet the boards. The NHL
recommended that it be black after testing for impact on spectators
and television cameras, concluding that black absorbed the light
better than white and was less of a distraction.</TE>
<TE>   At Staples Center, where the Kings play the San Jose Sharks
tonight, the netting will rise 22 feet above the glass and can be
raised and lowered by a winch. Cost to the Kings: about
$90,000-$100,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Pond, where the Mighty Ducks play the Minnesota Wild on
Friday night, the netting will rise some 60 feet above the glass,
topping out at about the same height as the last row in the upper
deck. Cost to the Ducks, including a chain-motor system to raise and
lower the netting: about $120,000.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks experimented with suspending the net lower but
determined that, when they hung it any lower, the aluminum rod used
to keep it in place was a significant barrier to some views, either
of the ice or the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams anticipate complaints from fans and say they will try
to accommodate spectators who want to relocate to other parts of the
building. At each of the league's arenas, depending on where they're
seated, some fans will view part of the ice through netting and other
parts unobstructed.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take a couple of games, I think, to get people used to it
because it's different than what they've been used to," King
President Tim Leiweke said. "But I think they'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Protective netting is used in all major European rinks and in
Canadian junior leagues, as well as some college arenas in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   In the NHL, however, only the Phoenix Coyotes had used it--to
protect fans in obstructed-view upper-level seats that hang over the
ice at the north end of America West Arena. In 1993, the Calgary
Flames installed netting but removed it after one game because of an
overwhelmingly negative reaction from fans.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a year before the tragedy in Columbus, NHL general managers
had discussed protective netting. They were concerned after a
$3-million settlement was reached by the Kings, Sharks and Shark
player Joe Murphy with a fan who was struck in the head when Murphy
angrily fired a puck into the stands while play was stopped during a
1999 game at the Forum.</TE>
<TE>   The discussions, however, never went beyond the preliminary stage,
Leiweke said, and the issue was never put to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Cecil's death changed the NHL's view. Attending her first hockey
game, she was watching the Columbus Blue Jackets play the Flames on
March 16 when a slap shot by Blue Jacket center Espen Knutsen was
deflected into the stands by Calgary defenseman Derek Morris with
12:18 to play in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Seated more than 100 feet behind the glass, between the goal and
the corner, she was struck in the left temple, the blow from the puck
fracturing her skull and bruising her brain on impact. Though she was
able to walk to a first-aid station and later to an ambulance, the
teenager died 48 hours later as a result of a blood clot, caused when
her head snapped back violently as she was hit.</TE>
<TE>   The heartsick Blue Jackets held a moment of silence before their
next home game and wore heart-shaped decals with Cecil's initials on
their helmets for the rest of the season. Knutsen, who fired the
shot, said he had trouble sleeping after the incident and Morris, who
deflected it into the stands, said he would always feel partly to
blame for Cecil's death, no matter what anybody told him.</TE>
<TE>   NHL players are aware that, not including the warmup periods,
pucks fly into the seats about 10 or more times a game, some at
speeds approaching 100 mph. Fans seated behind the goals are at the
greatest risk, and the widespread use of carbon-fiber sticks in
recent years has only increased the velocity of shots unleashed by
players who are bigger and stronger each season.</TE>
<TE>   King and Duck players, undoubtedly aware that many of their
families sit in the areas that will be protected at Staples Center
and the Pond, seem to favor the netting.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just glad for it," Duck center Steve Rucchin said. "It's
unbelievable how many pucks get fired into the stands and people are
either not paying attention or don't have time to react. It's scary.
I sit there on the bench sometimes and see one fired in and I just
think, 'That one's going to get somebody.' I know I'd be pretty
depressed if I got hit by one."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin knows well the damage a puck can inflict. Two seasons ago,
he was struck in the face by a slap shot by then-teammate Teemu
Selanne and suffered a broken nose and cheekbone, ending his season.
Last season, he was sidelined after suffering a broken bone in his
leg from a shot.</TE>
<TE>   In March, an NHL executive told Sports Illustrated that an average
of 200 NHL fans were injured by pucks in the 1,200 or so games played
each season over the last five years, a figure that seems low. The
magazine reported that in a paper presented to the Society for
Academic Emergency Medicine, an emergency-room physician in
Washington documented that in 127 games over three seasons at the
city's MCI Center in the late 1990s, 122 fans were attended to by
first-aid stations in the arena because of puck injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings and Ducks declined to release fan-injury statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In Columbus, the shot that hit Cecil also injured two other
spectators. After striking Cecil, who attended the game as an early
14th birthday present from her father, it hit a man in the back of
the head and knocked out a girl's tooth.</TE>
<TE>   Cecil's death wasn't the first among hockey spectators--since
1979, two others had died in small Canadian rinks, and one was killed
during a minor league exhibition match in Spokane, Wash.--but it will
be the one most publicly mourned.</TE>
<TE>   The black veils hanging in NHL arenas this season will see to
that.</TE>

<HD>Percival Is Hardly Afraid to Shoulder Angel Hopes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>He has 40 saves this season and 250 in his career, and it can be said
that Troy Percival's milestones represent mileposts on the Angels'
playoff drive.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, they also represent how far he has come since his 1999
shoulder surgery and how far he might go if the shoulder holds up and
the heat lasts.</LD>
<LD>   Only 20 relievers have registered 250 saves, as Percival did in
preserving Tuesday night's 1-0 victory over the A's, but at 33,
consistently reaching the mid-90s on the speed guns and restricting
opposing hitters to a .186 average, he seems to be only in mid-climb.</LD>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure I'd even be able to pitch again after the surgery,"
Percival says. "Now I'm past 200 and looking at 300.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I can pitch long enough to get another 150 saves. I'd
like to pitch another three or four years, at least.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can hang on long enough to keep this team in the playoff
hunt every year, I'd be happy."</TE>
<TE>   In the high-wire world of the closer, amid the high-octane
intensity of the division battle with the A's, Percival sat and
waited Wednesday night for a call that didn't come.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels took an early lead against a struggling Barry Zito, but
Mickey Callaway and Dennis Cook couldn't hold it.</TE>
<TE>   The rallying A's clubbed four home runs in a 7-4 victory that
re-tied the Angels for the division lead and left Percival sitting.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the heavy work is ahead.</TE>
<TE>   There are 10 games left in the regular season, and it would
require a collapse surpassing anything even in Angel history for the
veteran closer to miss his first playoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe, but I don't think any of us consider ourselves there yet,"
Percival said, clearly reading from the Mike Scioscia script, but who
can blame him?</TE>
<TE>   The manager's judicious use has helped keep him strong. The script
has been beneficial in more ways than one.</TE>
<TE>   While A's closer Billy Koch has appeared in 78 games, becoming the
first reliever Wednesday to save 40 and win 10 in the same season,
Percival has been in 56.</TE>
<TE>   He has pitched more than one inning only four times, never been
asked to pitch with his team behind, has converted all but four of
his 44 save chances, is second in the league in saves to the 43 by
Minnesota's Eddie Guardado and leads the statistics-based
fireman-of-the-year standings, featuring a 4-1 record and 1.66
earned-run average in addition to the 40 saves, two shy of his career
high.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pitched at a very high level all year," Scioscia said, "and
I don't think there's been even two days where he said he was down
and simply couldn't pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a testament to how hard he works, his durability, and, I
feel confident in saying, how we've used him. I also think the fact
that our entire bullpen has pitched so well has helped Percy.
Everybody has a role. We haven't been forced to extend him."</TE>
<TE>   A largely anonymous bullpen has compiled the best record in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   In Percival's view, however, the performance goes beyond the
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "They've set an aggressive tone," he said. "They've done a great
job throwing strikes and attacking hitters. It's great to come in
after them."</TE>
<TE>   Who knew for sure that Brendan Donnelly and Ben Weber and Scot
Shields, among others, would respond as they have?</TE>
<TE>   Then again, who knew in early December that the Angels would have
95 wins on Sept. 19 and be tied for the division lead?</TE>
<TE>   At that uncertain point, an unhappy Percival seemed likely to
demand a trade, Darin Erstad was about to be sent to the Chicago
White Sox for a package heavy on prospects, and there was no
indication Disney was going to step up financially and make the
needed improvements.</TE>
<TE>   What ensued, Percival said in happy reflection Wednesday, seemed
to ensue virtually overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Disney voided the Erstad trade, strengthened the rotation by
signing Aaron Sele and trading for Kevin Appier, and Percival signed
a two-year, $16-million extension after the departure of club
president Tony Tavares, who had raised his ire by allegedly leaking
confidential contract material.</TE>
<TE>   "I say thanks every day for four big moves," Percival said,
referring to the acquisitions of Sele, Appier, Cook and Brad Fullmer.
"We wouldn't be where we are without them."</TE>
<TE>   Where Percival would be with another 150 saves is at 400, trailing
only Lee Smith (478), his 1995 mentor with the Angels, and John
Franco (421).</TE>
<TE>   "But by then," Percival said, "it's pretty safe to assume that
Trevor Hoffman and Robb Nen will already be there. I mean, I hope to
pitch until my arm falls off, but at this point, considering my
mechanics, I don't think we're looking at a 20-year career. I use
everything in my body on every pitch. I have nothing left. It's hard
to imagine, considering how good I feel right now, that I'll feel
otherwise in three or four years, but I'll be 36 then, and with my
mechanics ... well, not too many guys are fortunate to keep going.
Then again, who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Percival, for instance, could be a different pitcher then.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he could be throwing the changeup he works on every day.
Maybe he will have better control of his curve.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't anticipate losing my velocity," he said, "but I'm working
on different pitches that might help me make a smoother transition if
it comes to that."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, of course, Percival isn't called the Bull for no
reason. He will be powering his way toward that next milestone.</TE>

<LD>The FIBA World Basketball Championships were costly off the court
too.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks after the United States' embarrassing sixth-place
finish, the Indiana Sports Corporation reported an expected loss of
$2.69 million on the tournament at Indianapolis.</LD>
<LD>   "We experienced a financial shortfall on the event, but we are
optimistic about identifying ways to eliminate the deficit and we
continue to be very upbeat about future events coming to this
community," ISC President Dale Neuburger said Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   With USA Basketball President Tom Jernstedt acknowledging during
the tournament that tickets were grossly overpriced, the event
averaged 6,414 spectators for 31 sessions at Conseco Fieldhouse and
the RCA Dome.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket prices ranged from $10 to $58 for the first round, $12 to
$66 for the second round, $24 to $110 for the quarterfinals, $65 to
$135 for the semifinals and $95 to $190 for the gold-medal game.
Tickets for the title game were later discounted.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. won its first five games to improve to 58-0 when using
NBA players in international competitions, then lost three of its
final four games to Argentina, Yugoslavia and Spain. The sixth-place
finish is the worst by a U.S. men's team in a major international
competition.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers signed free-agent forward Guy Rucker. Terms were not
disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Rucker averaged 14.7 points and 5.9 rebounds last season for
Debreceni Vadkakasok of the Hungarian A division. He played at Iowa
from 1996-99.</TE>

<TE>   Lisa Leslie scored 20 points and Sheryl Swoopes had 19 to lead the

<TE>   The defending champions are 4-0 as the tournament entered the
second round. They play South Korea today.</TE>

<TE>   Former WNBA All-Star Brandy Reed, whose career was sidetracked by
behavioral problems, was jailed in Hattiesburg, Miss., on outstanding
warrants after her arrest on disorderly conduct charges.</TE>
<TE>   Reed, the Phoenix Mercury's top scorer in 2000 at 19.0 points per
game and a former Southern Mississippi star, was arrested when
officers, investigating burglaries, stopped her on a street to ask
for identification, police said. Reed used a different name and was
taken to the county jail.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Reed cannot post bond on the disorderly conduct charge
until she pays outstanding fines on old charges that ranged from
possession of marijuana to not having a driver's license and driving
on the wrong side of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Reed sat out most of last season because of behavioral problems
and was suspended June 18 for conduct detrimental to the team.</TE>

<TE>   Utah Jazz announcer Rod Hundley, 67, was arrested on suspicion of
drunken driving Friday night, the Salt Lake County Sheriff's
Department said. Hundley was booked into the Salt Lake County Jail
and was released Saturday morning. Hundley could not be reached for
comment and the Jazz had no comment.</TE>

taken to Memorial City Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The
cause of death had not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., said it will hold a truck
series race during The Winston, NASCAR's All-Star event. The truck
series will make its debut at the track May 16, following qualifying
for The Winston.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Volkers, the Australian swimming coach who trained Olympic
medalists Susie O'Neill and Samantha Riley, was cleared of indecent
assault charges at Brisbane, Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Volkers was committed to stand trial in July on seven counts of

<DL></DL>
<LD>There are no rules in baseball. There are suggestions, trends,
statistical probabilities, historical happenings.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately it is up to a manager relying on numbers, averages, his
heart, his gut, to pitch to Barry Bonds or to walk him. To bring in
his closer, Eric Gagne, when his team is trailing by a run late in
the game.</LD>
<LD>   The manager who is confident in himself doesn't listen to the
suggestions from those who don't matter. The coach who is comfortable
with his talent doesn't care what anybody writes or says.</LD>
<TE>   When Bonds doubled in a couple of runs for the Giants on Tuesday
night, the easy second-guess became: Don't pitch to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   When Dodger closer Gagne went into Tuesday's game, with his team
behind by a run, after having pitched the previous two days, with two
more critical games ahead against the Giants, the easy second-guess
became: Don't pitch Gagne if it's not for the save.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Jim Colburn doesn't like second-guessing. Not by
media, not by fans. If you want to criticize the use of Gagne,
Colburn says, please call him up before the game and give him your
advice. "If you're right enough times," Colburn says, his hands
folded across his chest, his eyes narrowed, "then you can get hired
for this job."</TE>
<TE>   When Dodger Manager Jim Tracy is asked about Gagne and how much is
too much, Tracy has a defiant answer. "Those guys [the Giants] used
their guy [Robb Nen] for three innings one night."</TE>
<TE>   And you think of what your mom used to say: "If the boy next door
jumped out the window, would you jump out the window too?"</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday's game against the Giants, Gagne had pitched
three days in a row and thrown 69 pitches ("Is it 69?" Gagne asks.
"Someone else said it was 64.") It was 69. Gagne says he feels good,
that he feels strong, that he would absolutely, positively tell his
manager and his coach if his arm felt tired. "I'm about winning,"
Gagne says, "and if I felt like I would hurt my team, I would not
pitch."</TE>
<TE>   But when Gagne went into Tuesday's game, when the Dodgers were
behind, 5-4, and after the Dodgers had been behind all night, that
smacking sound you heard was Dodger fans hitting their foreheads with
their palms. Dodger fans think they know desperation when they see
it. They think they saw it Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   What if there would be a save situation Wednesday night? What if
the Dodgers were to fashion a one-run lead going into the ninth
inning?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm ready, not a problem," Gagne says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my job," Colburn says, "to make sure my pitchers are
ready. That's what I'm paid to do."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the time when you go with the guys who got you here,"
Tracy says. "This is what we've been working for. This is why I've
done what I've done with Eric all year."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy was adamant. Gagne was not wasted Tuesday, he said, and
Gagne would be ready Wednesday, at least for an inning. Twice before
this season, Gagne had pitched four straight games, four days in a
row. On the first occasion, back in June, Gagne threw 36 pitches on
the first three days. On the second occasion, last month, Gagne threw
42 pitches on the first three days.</TE>
<TE>   But those occasions were not against the team that's a game ahead
in the race for a final playoff spot. Those occasions did not come
with only 12, 11, 10 games left in the season.</TE>
<TE>   If using Gagne Tuesday night smacks of desperation, if it seems
things are falling apart for the Dodgers, if it appears Tracy lacks
confidence in his other relief pitchers, is that a surprise?</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger staff can't be stretched any thinner. The Dodgers need
at least a split of this four-game series, which would still leave
them a game behind the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   These Dodger-Giant games are lasting four hours, are being played
well after 11, for a reason. Because every swing, every step, every
pitch, every substitution, could mean the difference. Between winning
and losing. Between playing baseball or playing golf in October.
Between a triumphant overcoming of adversity or a surrendering to
injuries, to a thin bench, a thin pitching staff, to not enough
talent, to too many doubts.</TE>
<TE>   So the one thing Tracy can't do right now is care what anybody
else thinks.</TE>
<TE>   He pitched to Bonds on Tuesday and it hurt the Dodgers. He didn't
pitch to Bonds the first three times Bonds came up on Wednesday and
that hurt the Dodgers too. Bonds led off the second and third innings
with walks and the Giants scored runs in both of those innings. But
in the seventh, Tracy had Paul Shuey pitch to Bonds. Bonds struck
out. The crowd roared. The other Dodgers stood a little taller.</TE>
<TE>   The players pay attention to this. Bonds hits on Tuesday. Writers
say that Bonds should be walked, walked, walked. Tom Lasorda, who
should know better than to second-guess, says on television that "I
would never let Bonds beat me," which sounds as if Tom thinks Bonds
should be walked, walked, walked. And Bonds is walked, walked,
walked. Until he gets a chance to swing. Then he's out.</TE>
<TE>   How much Gagne pitches the rest of the season, there's no right
answer. And it's not always a bad thing to seem desperate and to take
desperate measures. Not when you're desperate.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Should Issue Ultimatum for Good Play</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internet forgets nothing, so 40 years from now when a teacher
assigns a youngster to research what took place on Sept. 18, they
will learn a horse beat the first U.S.-made locomotive on that date,
Patty Hearst was captured by the FBI and Roman Emperor Domitian was
assassinated by his wife.</LD>
<LD>   Digging deeper they will discover Sept. 18 has also been known as
National Chocolate Day and Michael Olowokandi Ultimatum Day.</LD>
<LD>   "Who is Michael Olowokandi?" some youngster will undoubtedly want
to know.</LD>
<TE>   "Nobody," will be the teacher's reply, and then the child will
return to computer work in the Donald Sterling Memorial Library a
little wiser.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M NOT sure I could dream up anything funnier than this: a
Clipper giving Sterling the ultimatum to give him money by Sept. 18
or else. I can just picture Olowokandi jumping up every time the
telephone rang Wednesday: "Oh, that's probably Don."</TE>
<TE>   Now why Sept. 18? I know the significance of Oct. 1 (the Clippers
open training camp) and the significance of Oct. 31 (the last date
the team can do a new deal with Olowokandi), but what's the big deal
about the 18th?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he's Swiss, because the 18th is known as "Kasteilet," a
holiday in Switzerland to celebrate "dividing the cheese."
Olowokandi--that's Swiss, isn't it?</TE>
<TE>   I called the office of Bill Duffy, the Swiss Man's agent, and was
told "he's not in, and if he was, he'd have no comment."</TE>
<TE>   I just want to know if Olowokandi is Swiss, I said, and if this is
all about dividing the cheese, and for some reason our conversation
went no further.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW AS I understand it, the Swiss Man made more than $4 million
last year, and the Clippers are obligated to give him a 30% pay
increase this year to $6 million if he can't get something better
elsewhere. The guy averaged 11.1 points last year in the season of
his life, and he's guaranteed a 30% pay increase on top of the
ridiculous amount of money they are already paying him. I'm surprised
Sept. 18 isn't forever known as the day the Swiss Man was indicted
for highway robbery.</TE>
<TE>   I exaggerated a little bit. He didn't have the season of his life
so much as the 23 games of his life with a new contract as a goal.
Now when he was at his best in those 23 games, the Clippers went
10-13, so maybe it's not such a good idea letting the Swiss Man touch
the ball so much.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi wants his money now, we're told, so he doesn't have to
worry in training camp. You can imagine the mental anguish, knowing
you might earn only $6 million this year if everything fails.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Stiff has averaged less than 10 points in 287 NBA games,
and yet he is insisting on being paid the maximum salary allowable,
which is $100 million for the next seven years. I'll pause at this
point so you can stop laughing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STERLING IS willing to pay Olowokandi more than the $6 million
he's obligated to give him this year. I'll pause again so you can
stop laughing.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have offered Olowokandi a contract that would pay him
nearly $8.5 million a year for the next seven seasons if he plays the
way he did in those final 23 games. Given what you've seen up to this
point, would you want it on your resume that you're the guy who paid
him more than $8.5 million a year? In the business of sports, that's
known as pulling a Kevin Malone.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are still going to have to pay big money to
Brand-Miller-Odom and Maggette, or throw away the makings of a
perennial playoff team. There will be lots of chances to ridicule
Sterling for being a tightwad.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ULTIMATUM DAY passed without the Clippers doing anything more, and
without the "or else" from Olowokandi. The Swiss Man will probably
sign the Clippers' qualifying offer of $6 million in the next few
days, play out the season, become a free agent and then wait to see
how the cheese will be divided next year.</TE>
<TE>   I just hope he doesn't go hungry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JACKIE CHAN, star of "The Tuxedo," and wearing a Dodger jersey
with No. 32 on his back, threw out the first pitch before Wednesday's
game against the Giants. I would have given him Kevin Brown's jersey;
at least they would have gotten some use out of it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STAT OF the year: Shawn Green (26), Paul Lo Duca (19), Adrian
Beltre (17), Mark Grudzielanek (17) and Cesar Izturis (12) have all
hit into more double plays than Mr. 6-4-3, Eric Karros (11).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NO. 2 STAT of the year: The Dodgers were 50-29, in first place
with a 3 1/2-game lead entering play on June 29 in Anaheim when
Manager Jim Tracy gave his, "I told you we knew what we were talking
about and you dummies didn't" speech to reporters. After Wednesday
night's 7-4 loss,  the Dodgers have gone 35-38 since then.</TE>

<TE>   USC UNVEILED a statue of the "Wild Bunch" outside Heritage Hall
this week, which includes Jimmy Gunn, Charles Weaver, Tody Smith,

<LD>Still basking in the afterglow of its best-ever World Cup showing,
the United States moved up a spot in the FIFA World rankings, which
were released Wednesday. The U.S. is at an all-time high No. 8, ahead
of traditional powers England (No. 9) and Italy (No. 10).</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. began the year ranked 24th and had moved to 11th in July
after reaching the World Cup quarterfinals, where it lost to Germany,
1-0. The U.S. then broke into the top 10 for the first time in August
when it was tied with Italy for ninth.</LD>
<LD>   Turkey also made a significant jump in the latest rankings, moving
four places to No. 7, the first time the Turks have been in the top
10.</LD>
<TE>   Brazil, which won its fifth World Cup this summer, remained No. 1
and was followed by France, Spain, Germany, Argentina and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching Search</TE>
<TE>   Pumas President Luis Reueiro is voicing his displeasure with
Argentine Coach Carlos Bianchi being mentioned as a possible
candidate to take over the Mexican national team because, in
Reueiro's words, Bianchi does not know Mexican soccer.</TE>
<TE>   Reueiro is campaigning for his club's coach, Hugo Sanchez, to get
the job while complaining that club team presidents' viewpoints are
not being taken into consideration by the federation while the
coaching search goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Federation President Alberto de la Torre has acknowledged
that he has already spoken with Sanchez as well as Ricardo Lavolpe
and Ricardo Ferreti and hopes to talk with Brazil Coach Luiz Felipe
Scolari next week.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Aguirre led Mexico to the second round of the World Cup,
where it lost to the United States, before accepting a job with
Osasuna in Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Guti Serves Notice</TE>
<TE>   Many see Real Madrid striker Guti as only keeping the seat warm
for high-priced Brazilian acquisition Ronaldo, who has yet to play
for the team because he is sidelined with a leg injury.</TE>
<TE>   But after scoring two goals in Real Madrid's 3-0 Champions Cup
victory over AS Roma, Guti said he's ready to challenge the two-time
FIFA player of the year for the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that Ronaldo will soon be fit to play, but I'm ready to
compete with him," Guit told the Italian daily, Corriere dello Sport.
"With these two goals I think I've demonstrated that I have all the
qualities to play in a great team like Real Madrid."</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, who left Inter Millan before the transfer deadline
earlier this month in a $44.5-million transaction, watched the match
from Spain.</TE>
<TE>   "Guti amazed me again," Ronaldo told Corriere dello Sport. "I
don't know him very well, but it seems he has remarkable technical
ability."</TE>
<TE>   No Pitch, No Play</TE>
<TE>   The lone field in the British Virgin Islands is unavailable so it
was forced to cancel its 2002 season despite expanding its league to
12 teams.</TE>
<TE>   British Virgin Islands Football Assn. President Andy Bickerton
told Reuters that the decision was made because with an expanded
league, three months were needed to play the season and that the
field at the Valley Recreation Ground is being renovated and will not
be available until November. Plus, the field's first priority is to
play host to cricket's Busta Cup in late January.</TE>
<TE>   Ranked No. 160 in the world by FIFA, the British Virgin Islands
was beaten, 14-1, in aggregate goals by Bermuda in World Cup
qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Earthquakes Hurting</TE>
<TE>   As if it wasn't enough of a distraction for defending Major League
Soccer champion San Jose to play a meaningless exhibition three days
before its biggest match of the season, the Earthquakes also found
out they will be without All-Star defensive midfielder Richard
Mulrooney for the season-ending, conference-deciding match against
the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Mulrooney, who suffered the season-ending injury in the
Earthquakes' 1-0 loss to the Galaxy Saturday, underwent X-rays that
revealed a fracture in his right ankle. He will have surgery today.</TE>
<TE>   The Earthquakes played host to Mexico's defending champion, Club
America, Wednesday night in San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Title IX Returns to Courthouse</HD>
<DH>Colleges: In latest challenge to law, plaintiffs claim
policy is having a negative effect on men in minor sports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARYANN HUDSON HARVEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Terry Crawford, former Olympic coach, coach of national champions,
champion of men and women, and a woman, is having a conversation she
would have once thought unfathomable.</LD>
<LD>   Mired in conflict, fearful of change because she doesn't quite
trust the ones making the changes, she's talking about a law--Title
IX--that greatly helped her life and countless other women in sports,
and she's troubled that it's not doing the same for men.</LD>
<LD>   "I just finished a term as president of the U.S. Track Coaches
Assn., and roster management [capping] in men's teams is a major
issue for schools throughout the nation," said Crawford, the track
and field coach for men and women at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, which,
she adds, is not a victim.</LD>
<TE>   "The number of athletes on men and women's teams is so drastically
different, it's like a flashing neon sign. If a male athlete has an
injury or is ineligible, his coach is left in a lurch. On the other
hand, schools are adding as many females to the roster as they can
almost round up."</TE>
<TE>   That neon sign, which used to signal blatant inequities for women
in sports, now has an arrow under it pointing toward the men, and the
courthouse. The latest challenge to reform Title IX is now in the
throes of legal maneuvering in the U.S. District Court in the
District of Columbia. If successful, this case could dramatically
change the way the 30-year-old law--credited with having greatly
increased opportunities for girls and women in sports--is enforced.</TE>
<TE>   The defendant, the U.S. Department of Education, which enforces
the law that bans sex discrimination in education programs or
activities that receive federal funds, has filed for dismissal. The
plaintiffs, a group of college coaches, alumni and athletes, have
filed a motion for summary judgment. Oral arguments are set for Oct.
2.</TE>
<TE>   The court will hear the plaintiffs, as well as other reformist
groups that include men and women, claim the department's policy
enforcing Title IX was unlawfully adopted and allows schools to run
their sports programs under a quota system. With the bulging roster
of football teams, and the financial restraints of athletic programs,
reformists say leftover opportunities for men in minor sports are
sparse and teams often are eliminated or capped by schools seeking to
achieve the right numbers for compliance.</TE>
<TE>   Core to the complaint is the three-part test, a policy developed
in 1979 to help schools determine if they are in compliance, and the
1996 letter of clarification of that test, which the plaintiffs
allege further skewed the law by establishing a quota program.</TE>
<TE>   They want the test invalidated.</TE>
<TE>   "We are saying that the [Department of Education] didn't have the
authority to adopt the three-part test in the first place, didn't
adopt the test with the proper procedure and, finally, by not
revisiting the policy in light of the changed circumstance between
the 1970s and the 1990s, failed as an agency," says Larry Joseph,
attorney with McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge LLP., the Washington firm
representing the plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Justice has asked for dismissal of the complaint
based on procedural grounds. A spokesman for the department said it
would make no comment about the suit other than what is contained in
its filings. In June, the Department of Education, citing the suit
and the 30th anniversary of Title IX, created a commission to review
the issues surrounding its policy enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Previous challenges to Title IX--all of which have been
denied--have been against schools. This is the first suit brought
against the policy maker. "The other suits were focused on a
particular instance--a team being cut by a school, or a team being
denied--but this is directly challenging the policy interpretation,
and it is a much more narrow focus," said Kim Yuracko, assistant law
professor at Northwestern University.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the allegations involving policy in this case have been
included, albeit indirectly, in other lawsuits, according to law
experts who have reviewed the case. But the allegation that the
Department of Education changed the rules without following proper
procedure is clearly new.</TE>
<TE>   "It is claimed that the [1979] policy is contrary to statute and
the Constitution," says Thomas Sargentich, law professor at American
University College of Law.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unclear about the likelihood of plaintiffs' success with
these arguments, which aren't new. I think the most novel thing
[about the suit] is the procedural challenge. There are many such
challenges in the law generally, and they tend to turn on the court's
view of whether the later interpretation significantly differs if at
all from the earlier interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, if courts are disposed to be critical of agencies, it
is often easier for them to take such an approach on the basis of
procedural concerns, as they don't intrude as directly into the
substance of policy."</TE>
<TE>   The test offers three ways to comply with Title IX, but the suit
takes issue mostly with the measure using proportionality, i.e., if
60% of the school's student body are women, then 60% of the school's
athletes should be women. The plaintiffs want compliance to be based
on the law's original regulations--adopted in 1975--which called for
equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes based on
interest, not enrollment. The two other ways to comply center on
offering opportunities based on the interest of students, but the
plaintiffs say they also cause schools to unlawfully favor women.</TE>
<TE>   Yuracko, whose paper on the proportionality policy of Title IX
will be published this winter in the Northwestern Law Review, says a
method of compliance based solely on the interest of students could
prove difficult. "How do you do it--send out a survey?" she asked.
"Interest level is completely variable and courts have been reluctant
to deal with it. It would depend on who a school decides to admit,
the recruiting, and what resources are already there.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we have these huge dilemmas and we don't have a good
model of what it means not to discriminate is because men and women
don't compete against each other. In the work world, at least it is
theoretically clear. Men and women can be measured against the same
set of criteria.... We don't have that when we move to the
sex-segregated sports world because we don't have a single unitary
metric along which to compare them."</TE>
<TE>   Valerie Bonnette worked for the Office of Civil Rights (which
enforces Title IX in the Education Department) for 15 years and
co-authored the agency's 1990 Title IX athletics investigator's
manual. Now, as owner of Good Sports Inc., she counsels schools on
compliance, and says the interests of students can be measured many
ways, including club, physical education and community recreation
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if more education administrators understood [interest
compliance], they would be less focused on proportionality as the
only compliance method," she says. " ... I think it would help the
men."</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, school officials are reluctant to talk openly about
Title IX compliance, citing its complexity and litigious history.
Most do say, however, that compliance is challenging.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt that Title IX necessitates making some tough and
difficult decisions," says Marcia Saneholtz, senior associate
athletic director at Washington State. "But people find ways to
accomplish what they value. If [schools] value offering equal
opportunities, they will find a way to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Women's groups that oppose reform, such as the Women's Sports
Foundation and the National Women's Law Center, say the purpose of
Title IX is to create the same opportunities for female and male
athletes, and does not require eliminating men's teams.</TE>
<TE>   They contend it is the schools' choice to comply by dropping
teams, and believe that schools could easily maintain all sports by
spending less on football and basketball and giving each sport a
smaller allocation of the athletic budget. These groups cite
government statistics and studies that show that, while some men's
sports have been dropped by schools since Title IX, other sports have
been added, and men's participation in college sports has increased
overall by 22%.</TE>
<TE>   They claim some sports are dropped for revenue reasons and have
nothing to do with Title IX. Regardless, more than 171 collegiate
wrestling programs have been cut since 1981, and reformers say track
and field has lost more than 91 programs since 1993. One wrestler,
Frank Ryan, had the misfortune of attending two schools that cut
their wrestling programs, both citing Title IX reasons. His third
school cut wrestling also, but after he graduated.</TE>
<TE>   For these athletes, it's difficult to see the equality. "What I
have seen when a program is dropped is that a student has to choose
between leaving their friends to transfer to another school, and
giving up on their athletic dreams," says Eric Pearson, chairman of
the board of College Sports Council, one of the plaintiffs in the
suit.</TE>
<TE>   Despite these hardships for men, women still trail. In 30 years of
Title IX, studies show women's participation in college varsity
sports has increased by 403%, but men still receive nearly 28% more
opportunities to participate. And though 54% of college students are
female, they receive only 36% of the sports operating dollars, 42% of
athletic scholarships and 32% of the recruiting budget, according to
a 1999-2000 NCAA study.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents fear any reform would weaken the law and turn back the
gains. "Title IX has done so much good that I'm very torn right now,"
Crawford, the track coach at Cal Poly. "I have some concerns that, in
revisiting these interpretations, it has to be handled with kid
gloves, not slashed and cut to a point that it has no real power....</TE>
<TE>   "There was a timeliness of good will that it [proportionality]
served, but I don't think the originators of the bill intended it to
hurt male athletes."</TE>

<HD>Tours' Agreement Erases Long-Standing Line in the Sand</HD>

<LD>After nearly a decade of hostility, the world's most significant pro
beach volleyball tours have agreed to bury the hatchet in the sand.</LD>
<LD>   The Assn. Of Volleyball Professionals and the Federation
Internationale de Volleyball have agreed to avoid future clashes and,
at the same time, have scheduled four major FIVB tournaments to be
played in the U.S. over the next three years.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of the agreement, a grand slam event will be held in
the U.S. in 2003, and two grand slam events will be held in the U.S.
in 2004. All three events will be worth double the normal points
toward the FIVB Olympic qualifying process.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the 2005 beach volleyball world championships will be
held in the U.S., with at least $800,000 in combined prize money for
men and women. Such a payout would be the highest in beach volleyball
history.</TE>
<TE>   The competing AVP and FIVB tours have had major clashes over the
Olympic qualifying process since beach volleyball debuted at the 1996
Atlanta Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's announced agreement did not alter the controversial
Olympic qualifying process--players can only make the Olympics by
successfully competing in FIVB tournaments around the world during an
18-month span--but it appears to be progress.</TE>
<TE>   "It's monumental in many respects because there's a history of
less-than-cooperative relationships," AVP Commissioner Leonard Armato
said. "The fact the AVP and FIVB have decided to work closely and
cooperatively bodes well for the future of volleyball."</TE>
<TE>   The tours' pact to avoid scheduling major tournaments
simultaneously should end longtime tensions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Sinjin Smith and partner Randy Stoklos were fined $70,000
by the AVP for playing in a tournament in Spain instead of an AVP
tournament in Seal Beach. It was the first step in Smith's eventual
departure from the AVP to the FIVB.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, Eric Fonoimoana and Dain Blanton were briefly
suspended by the AVP in July 2000 because they played at an FIVB
tournament in Italy instead of an AVP tournament at the same time in
Muskegon, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Because the FIVB now recognizes the AVP as the official U.S. tour,
it is expected to allow only U.S. players in good standing with the
AVP to participate in FIVB events. It appears the top U.S. women's
team of Misty May and Kerri Walsh must join the AVP in order to also
play FIVB tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   May and Walsh eschewed the AVP this season in favor of more
lucrative payouts on FIVB tournaments, among other things.</TE>
