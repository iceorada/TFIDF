<KH>POP MUSIC REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Beenie Man's way with music is 'the Jamaican way'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beenie Man is comfortable with modern pop. The reggae singer's newest
album, "Tropical Storm," recruits Janet Jackson, the Neptunes, Lil'
Kim and others. But at the House of Blues on Sunday, he was all about
the dancehall.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not a rapper. I'm a chanter," he told the crowd. "I do this
the Jamaican way."</LD>
<LD>   For his 90-minute performance, Beenie Man was charismatic, bawdy
and festive, stepping out in a military dress jacket and white
captain's hat, looking both ridiculous and devoted to a good time.
And he moved easily from high-energy dancehall vocals to pop
crooning, as his Jamaican five-piece band made sounds hard-edged and
richly tropical.</LD>
<TE>   He found a blend of energetic reggae and pop with "Party Hard" and
the current hit, "Feel It Boy." Just as often, Beenie Man told
stories as the band jammed behind him.</TE>
<TE>   He recounted in detail a romantic interlude that began at his
front door, complete with a demonstration, thrusting his hips (and a
jewel-encrusted belt-buckle). "Watch and learn," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a short opening set, rappers Smilez &amp; Southstar aimed for the
same good times. Though recorded beats and effects made their backing
music perfunctory and anonymous, as rappers they were full of fire,
stepping up to the edge of the stage in their Lakers shirts, tough
and playful in their quest for the same vibe as party master Beenie
Man.</TE>

<HD>Notes from a reluctant rock star</HD>
<DH>Are Kurt Cobain's published diaries a service to his
legacy or an invasion?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Boucher</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first page of the book is an invitation. The young artist's
handwriting is a relaxed scrawl framed by the modest blue lines of a
spiral notebook. "When you wake up this morning, please read my
diary," it says. "Look through my things and figure me out."</LD>
<LD>   The last page is a screed. It mocks celebrity and blunt thinking.
The last sentence is about rednecks wading through fish entrails in
sunless Alaska. This time, the words are written by a miserable
millionaire and drift across the unlined stationary of the Hotel
Excelsior in Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Those two captured moments in the writing life of rock star Kurt
Cobain are presented as the terminals of his ill-fated artistic
voyage in a new book in stores titled, simply, "Journals" (Riverhead
Press), which reverentially duplicates 274 pages of his personal
writings from the late 1980s through 1994. In the beginning, he is a
troubled but ambitious singer in a baby rock band. In the last, he is
a 27-year-old celebrity just weeks ahead of a shotgun suicide. In
between are his words on music and politics, friends, rivals and
lovers, and, most memorably, his addictions and pain. "I remember
someone saying if you try heroine [sic] once you'll become hooked,"
he writes in one entry. "Of course I laughed and scoffed but now I
believe this to be very true."</LD>
<TE>   Released Monday, the book presents intact doodles, lyric
fragments, redundancies and grammatical misadventures, all put to
page in the handwriting of the late author. Like the Nirvana singer's
music and life, "Journals" is laced with humor and horror and often
wrenchingly candid.</TE>
<TE>   "I made about 5 million dollars last year ... ill [sic] be able to
sell my untalented, very ungenious ass for years based on my cult
status," he writes. In another section he defines his dashed dreams
in the wake of the grunge movement: "We simply wanted to give those
dumb heavy metal kids (the kids we used to be) an introduction to a
different way of thinking ... all we got was flack, backstabbing and
Pearl Jam."</TE>
<TE>   The publication of the diaries has stirred a minor debate among
fans and in the media: Is it a service to Cobain's legacy, or an
unseemly auctioning of his personal thoughts?</TE>
<TE>   "From the moment of acquisition there were many words written
about the trespass, and the scandal and the violation of this," says
the book's editor, Julie Grau of Riverhead Books.</TE>
<TE>   That acquisition was made from the Cobain estate last year for a
reported $4 million, ending a bidding war for access to 27 notebooks
and folders jammed with letters, sketches and notes penned by the
late singer-songwriter. Cobain's widow, singer-actress Courtney Love,
has endured abuse from some Nirvana fans who view her as a profiteer,
and the decision to publish the journals (along with a recently
settled court battle to enhance her share of control over Nirvana's
recordings) has likely not changed that. Other observers, though,
will hail Love's decision to share the writings.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever put it together did a lovely job," former Nirvana manager
Danny Goldberg, now chief of Artemis Records, said after thumbing
through the hardcover. "I'm glad it exists."</TE>
<TE>   Newsweek found the book so valuable as a document that the
magazine devoted its Oct. 28 cover story to "Journals," with lengthy
excerpts inside. Juxtapose that reverence with the scathing review
published last week in the New York Daily News: "How would you like
to spend several hours," the reviewer asks, "with a humorless,
enraged, paranoid, contemptuous, suicidal heroin addict?"</TE>
<TE>   Another early review, this one published in England in the
Observer, comes from a famous rock star who is himself mentioned in
"The Journals" -- Pete Townshend of the Who. Cobain writes, "I hope I
die before I become Pete Townshend" in one of his entries, an attack
on aging baby boomer rebels settling in as elder statesmen.
Townshend's review, though, is not so much a rebuttal as an analysis
of Cobain's familiar life trajectory.</TE>
<TE>   "Read this book to see that the human spirit, even at its most
sublime, can effect monumental damage on itself and its fellow souls
if addiction enters the story," Townshend writes. "I mourn for Kurt.
A once beautiful, then pathetic, lost and heroically stupid boy. Hard
rock indeed."</TE>
<TE>   The book arrives at a time when Nirvana is still percolating in
pop culture. The release last week of "Nirvana," a single-disc survey
of the band's music, included "You Know You're Right," an unreleased
song that put Cobain's plaintive voice back on the radio in recent
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Also, last year marked 10 years since the release of "Nevermind,"
the band's breakthrough masterpiece. Among the anniversary tie-ins
was the publication of "Heavier Than Heaven," a biography of Cobain
by Christopher R. Cross. That book was informed by Cross'
unprecedented access to the same writings that would be culled for
"Journals."</TE>
<TE>   The author said last week that "Journals" very much captures the
tone of the original mass of writings, although, he notes, the
representation of Love in the book does not match that of the
unfiltered journals. "Clearly," the writer said, "there was a
decision to not put in as much stuff about Courtney as Kurt had
written."</TE>
<TE>   Cross said his first encounter with Cobain's writings while
preparing for "Heavier than Heaven" was an emotionally wringing
experience and he suspects readers of "Journals" will be likewise
moved, pained and amused by its contents. As for critics who assail
the publication of the new book, Cross answers that in Cobain's home,
the journals were more like a piece of public art than a diary
secreted away in a drawer.</TE>
<TE>   "These were not things he kept as precious gems locked away,"
Cross said. "They literally were on his coffee table and he kept them
open. Frequently when his friends came by, he pointed to his friends
and said, 'Here read this, what do you think?' Many people have seen
these through the years, just not all of them."</TE>
<TE>   "Journals" editor Grau says the writings themselves seem to have
been written with an audience in mind, an important nuance to her
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very declarative and they were written outward," Grau
said. "As opposed to a diary that is a private confessional and a
receptacle for the innermost thoughts, these were more workbooks....
It's very hard for me to find something in here that isn't written to
somebody, even if its an imaginary reader."</TE>
<TE>   The two most relevant figures in distilling Cobain's journals were
Grau and Love's manager, Jim Barber. Grau, 38, came to the project
with a varied resume, ranging from novels such as "An Instance of the
Fingerpost" by Iain Pears to the books by financial guru Suze Orman.</TE>
<TE>   Barber, meanwhile, has been linked romantically with Love in the
press, making his presence perhaps nettlesome to the anti-Love
contingent of Nirvana fans.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a friend, and only a friend, to the material," Grau said.
"In the editorial handling of this material, the only interest he
served was that of Kurt's. The only pages he said he wanted out were
pages that did not reflect well on Kurt, the juvenilia. Jim is not an
anonymous person and his affiliations are known, but he also has a
deep respect for music and artists."</TE>
<TE>   Grau came to the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles in late April to
huddle with Barber for three marathon sessions to review the mass of
pages, which they sorted through three times. Grau and Barber quickly
agreed "on about 95%" of the final product, which Grau said
represents about a quarter of the entire trove.</TE>
<TE>   And what would Cobain think of his innermost thoughts being
perched on the new release rack? Fittingly, the artist of so many
contradictions gives us two conflicting answers.</TE>
<TE>   In one section of "Journals," he laments the theft of his journal
pages from hotel rooms. "You have raped me harder than you will ever
know," he tells the guilty parties.</TE>
<TE>   But on the front cover of one of his notebooks, he offers a
different message: "If You Read You'll Judge."</TE>

<HD>Spy films lose heart</HD>
<DH>With 'I Spy,' another classic TV espionage show becomes a
lame, less-than-cool movie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Burlingame</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One more classic spy show has been trashed by its big-screen
counterpart -- a fact that hasn't escaped audiences who roundly
rejected "I Spy" last weekend at the box office. The movie "I Spy,"
as most critics have pointed out, isn't really "I Spy." It's just
another lame buddy-cop comedy that bears little resemblance to the
well-produced, fondly remembered and Emmy-winning adventure series
that starred Robert Culp and Bill Cosby.</LD>
<LD>   This is the latest in a seemingly unending run of disastrous
adaptations of the lighthearted espionage dramas that were a staple
of mid-1960s television. "Mission: Impossible" (1996), "The Avengers"
(1998) and "The Wild Wild West" (1999) also ran roughshod over the
characters and concepts of the originals.</LD>
<LD>   "What bothers me about all of these films is the incredible
artificiality of all the 'coolness,' " declares television historian
Ric Meyers, author of "TV Detectives" and "Murder on the Air."</LD>
<TE>   "On television, these characters really cared for each other.
Hollywood just seems to hate that. They always get rid of it, and by
taking that out, you're literally ripping the heart out of the
movie."</TE>
<TE>   The new "I Spy" has Eddie Murphy playing Kelly Robinson, an
arrogant middleweight boxer who is recruited to help Owen Wilson, as
second-rate American spy Alexander Scott, crash a Budapest party
where bad guy Malcolm McDowell is about to auction off a highly
advanced version of the Stealth bomber.</TE>
<TE>   In the TV show, Kelly Robinson (Culp) was the white guy. He was
also an extremely sharp secret agent who posed as a tennis player on
the international circuit (and wouldn't have needed the "help" of an
obnoxious jive-talker with an entourage). Alexander Scott (Cosby) was
not just a sidekick, either. His cover was as Robinson's trainer, but
he was a Rhodes scholar who could speak a dozen languages fluently.</TE>
<TE>   No one could accuse the current bumbling duo of being Rhodes
scholars. The new Robinson and Scott, says TV Guide critic Matt
Roush, "are two goofs. There's nothing cool about them. They think
they're cool, whereas Culp and Cosby knew they were cool. They
weren't trying to impress anybody. They were just impressive."</TE>
<TE>   Meyers' and Roush's opinion is echoed by TV experts and die-hard
fans of the old shows, who contend that contemporary filmmakers have
failed to recapture the essence of the classic spy series -- or
worse, simply ruined them.</TE>
<TE>   Notes Robert J. Thompson, professor of media and popular culture
at Syracuse University: "What we loved about that program was the
interaction between the two characters. By the time 'I Spy' was into
its second season, they had a relationship that really clicked. You
can't do that in one 'Sexual Healing'-'Cyrano de Bergerac' scene," he
adds, referring to a comical moment in the movie.</TE>
<TE>   The translation of "The Avengers" from TV to film was equally
problematic, Meyers points out. Genuine affection was missing here
too. Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, as British spies John Steed and
Emma Peel, "were unbelievably charming. They loved each other; they
loved what they were doing. You looked at Ralph Fiennes and Uma
Thurman [Steed and Peel in the movie], and there was not an ounce of
charm or joy in them."</TE>
<TE>   "The Avengers" may have been the most difficult, because of its
peculiarly British Swinging '60s sensibility and the innate style of
Macnee and Rigg, the latter a feminine ideal for the mod era (smart
and sexy, athletic but not too threatening).</TE>
<TE>   But at least it retained the original musical theme, which is such
a key element in all these shows. "I Spy" dispenses completely with
the signature music of Earle Hagen, just as "The Wild Wild West"
alludes only briefly to Richard Markowitz's famous theme, which was
as integral to the TV show as the private railroad car of James West
(Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin).</TE>
<TE>   A bigger problem with that film was the unlikely notion of a black
Secret Service agent in 1869 America.</TE>
<TE>   "By putting Will Smith in it," Meyers says, "they thought that
they could ignore the fact." Adds Roush: "They turned it into this
elephantine thing, trying to clobber the audience with spectacle and
the sense of 'selling' something."</TE>
<TE>   "Mission: Impossible," the only one of these features to perform
well at the box office, was a complete betrayal of Bruce Geller's
acclaimed, long-running spy series.</TE>
<TE>   Ahead of its time both visually and in its stories, TV's "Mission"
demanded the full attention of the viewer as it wove an intricate
tale -- often without dialogue, relying on sound effects and Lalo
Schifrin's music -- involving a team of American agents working
several angles at once.</TE>
<TE>   "Mission: Impossible" was about a team, Roush points out. "It was
about the intricacy, about the process." Instead it became a star
vehicle for Tom Cruise. And worse, it made Impossible Missions Force
team leader Jim Phelps (played on TV by Peter Graves, in the film by
Jon Voight) a treasonous villain.</TE>
<TE>   "That could have made a really good movie," says Thompson. "What
worked so well [on TV] was that great moment, the thrill at the end
where the plan all came together, where you wanted to jump off the
couch and scream 'Busted!' " That was totally lost [in the feature].
The puzzle never came together. It remained a puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   The TV shows worked, says Thompson, "because they were constrained
by the small screen. They were able to concentrate exclusively on
character and story and the relationship between the characters. The
luxuries that the filmmaker has -- the big screen, the big budget,
special effects and all the rest -- tend to completely dilute, and in
the case of 'Mission: Impossible' completely eliminate, the very
things that made these shows interesting in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent failure of "I Spy," we may not have seen the
end of big-screen adaptations of classic spy shows. "The Man From
U.N.C.L.E." is in development at Warner Bros. Notes Roush: "I think
the original series are going to outlive these rotten movies that are
so cynically made out of them, turning them into these cheap
spectacles that are so annoying. I quake in fear of what they're
going to do with 'Man From U.N.C.L.E.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jon Burlingame is the author of "TV's Biggest Hits: The Story of
Television Themes From 'Dragnet' to 'Friends' " and "Sound and
Vision: 60 Years of Motion Picture Soundtracks."</TE>

<HD>Berlin ensemble technically solid but lacks depth</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even as Simon Rattle's glamorous debut as the Berlin Philharmonic's
chief conductor occupies the international spotlight this fall,
subsets within the orchestra continue their activities. One of them,
the Berlin Philharmonic Wind Quintet, turned up on the Coleman
Chamber Music series at Caltech's Beckman Auditorium on Sunday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The program that these musicians presented amply displayed their
virtuosity but didn't provide much in the way of depth, alas. First
came two trifles from the pen of Mozart by way of transcriptions --
the Fantasy in F minor, K. 594 that was originally dashed off for a
mechanical organ, and the Adagio in B flat, K. 411, which sounded
fuller and more balanced in this transcription than in the original
version for two clarinets and three basset horns.</LD>
<LD>   The galloping first and third movements of Anton Reich's Wind
Quintet in D, Opus 91, No. 3 were taken at fast tempos that
challenged the fingers and embouchures of even these skilled players.
Holst's 1903 Quintet in A-flat, which wasn't performed until 1982,
proved to be a surprisingly bland, conventionally structured piece,
with hardly any of the composer's usual modal flavor and personality.</LD>
<TE>   Of these works, only Nielsen's Wind Quintet -- which is loaded
with the tang, bite and quirky signatures of his symphonies --
qualifies as an inspired piece, and it brought out the best in the
five players, who reveled in the work's impatient humor.</TE>

<LD>"AAGGHH!" Jenna Elfman lets out a lusty, blood-curdling scream as a
huge gorilla wearing a diving helmet picks her up and strides across
a facility that looks like a cross between a retro sci-fi laboratory
and a futuristic pet store. The gorilla lurches to a halt, just in
front of a sign that reads "Area 52: Keeping things from the American
people since 1947."</LD>
<LD>   Elfman and her co-stars, who include real-life actor Brendan
Fraser and, to be added later, cartoon characters Bugs Bunny and
Daffy Duck, have been under attack most of the day from a variety of
sci-fi monsters -- in actuality hot, sweaty men dressed in sci-fi
monster suits -- playing characters that date to such vintage sci-fi
low films as "The Day of the Triffids," "Forbidden Planet" and "The
Man From Planet X." Director Joe Dante seems to know every sci-fi
movie ever made, so I ask him if there's a secret to directing movie
monsters. "You just yell at them," he says. "Yell really loud."</LD>
<LD>   Dante stares fondly at the Metaluna Mutant from "This Island
Earth." "That's the guy who gave me nightmares as a kid," he says.
"So now I'm getting my revenge."</LD>
<TE>   Call it sweet revenge. For the last two months, Dante has been
here on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, making "Looney Tunes: Back
in Action," a $100-million-plus film that is perhaps the most
ambitious combination of live action and animation since "Who Framed
Roger Rabbit" in 1988. Bugs and Daffy aren't here today -- they won't
come to life for six more months -- so for now the movie's focus is
on its live-action actors and monsters.</TE>
<TE>   With an infectious laugh and a swirl of swept-back graying hair,
Dante has the fast-talking energy of a cartoon schemer out of the
pages of Mad magazine. If anyone was born to make a comedy populated
with the entire gallery of Warner Bros. cartoon characters, from the
Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote to Tweety, Sylvester and the Tasmanian
Devil, it's Dante, who has an encyclopedic knowledge of cartoon movie
history and has already worked cartoon characters into nearly all of
his movies, which include "The Howling," "Gremlins," "Innerspace" and
"Small Soldiers." "Looney Tunes" is such a vast undertaking that even
after Dante finishes his 68-day shoot later this month, the film will
be in post-production for nearly a year as animators create the
cartoon characters and a visual-effects team assembles roughly 1,200
special-effects shots. The film's current release date -- Nov. 14,
2003 -- speaks volumes about its position in the Warner Bros.
firmament. 2003 is the year Warner Bros. doesn't have a "Harry
Potter" film, so it's counting on "Looney Tunes" to provide the
studio with a big holiday season family hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Warners is looking at this picture as a way of helping the studio
own the Christmas season next year," explains Bernie Goldman, one of
the film's producers. "And at a studio, let's face it, there's
nothing better than a family-friendly franchise filled with
characters that people love and adore."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Warner Bros. has been Hollywood's most
single-minded franchise factory, persuaded that franchise films,
though rarely artistically satisfying, represent the safest way for a
media conglomerate to wring extra profits out of its home video,
cable TV and consumer products subsidiaries. In addition to "Harry
Potter," the studio has been churning out sequels to "Cats and Dogs,"
"Scooby-Doo," "The Whole Nine Yards" and "Analyze This," as well as
new "Superman" and "Three Stooges" movies and remakes of such films
as "The In-Laws" and "Around the World in 80 Days."</TE>
<TE>   Spirit of anarchy</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to "Looney Tunes," the brash spirit of anarchy that
populates the original cartoons seems to have infected the otherwise
blandly efficient Warner Bros. assembly line. In fact, the more time
you spend on the set, the more you feel like you've stumbled onto a
bunch of guys who've somehow convinced a studio to let them spend
$100 million on a madcap Marx Brothers movie.</TE>
<TE>   For years, the studio has been trying to revive the Looney Tunes
characters, who were largely wasted in "Space Jam," a 1996 film that
made them Michael Jordan sidekicks. The characters remained dormant
until "Simpsons" writer-producer Larry Doyle pitched Warner Bros.
last year on the idea of making a new collection of "Looney Tunes"
short films. After agreeing to move ahead, the studio asked him to
take a whack at a feature too.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem in the past was that the studio wanted all of the
characters to go through personal growth and have a character arc,
but cartoon characters don't change. That's part of their appeal,"
explains Doyle, who has a team of writers from "The Simpsons,"
"Futurama" and "King of the Hill" producing a dozen six-minute shorts
that will debut early next year in front of Warner Bros. features.</TE>
<TE>   Doyle says his script is like one for an old Marx Brothers or
Hope-Crosby movie. "They were comedians who had the same persona in
each film; it was just the places and story that changed." He laughs.
"I'm sure from the studio point of view, this is a plane crash
waiting to happen, but I guess they've had to relax a little now,
since we're already shooting."</TE>
<TE>   After Doyle fleshed out a treatment, a separate team of writers,
John Requa and Glenn Ficarra, wrote a first-draft script. Doyle did a
second draft that got the movie up and running. Since then, the
studio has brought in other writers to polish and punch up jokes.
Holding a sheaf of new script pages, Dante cackles, "One day I even
got a rewrite for something I'd already shot!"</TE>
<TE>   Dante's jest sounds like a line of dialogue right out of the
script, which is crammed with mocking in-jokes about moviemaking. The
story line, such as it is, focuses on Bugs' jealous rival, Daffy
Duck, who lobbies the studio's vice president of comedy, played by
Elfman, to turn a new Bugs comedy into a starring vehicle for Daffy.
Elfman orders D.J. the Security Guard, played by Fraser, to eject
Daffy from the lot. This leads the characters on a quest for the
fabled Blue Monkey Diamond, which is also being sought by an evil
corporate overlord, played by Steve Martin, and by D.J.'s dad, the
dashing star of a James Bond-style spy film series, who is played by
onetime "Bond" star Timothy Dalton.</TE>
<TE>   The script lampoons Warner Bros.' obsession with sequels (one
scene has Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, dressed as toddlers, in a
poster for the film "Lethal Weapon Babies: Nap Time's Over").
Elfman's studio exec character refers to Bugs as a studio "core
asset," saying, "I was brought in to leverage your synergy." When
things are looking particularly grim for the cartoon heroes, Elfman
barks into her cell phone: "Sell all my Warner Bros. stock! I got an
inside tip that Daffy Duck is about to die!" Daffy retorts: "Ha! So
you do think I'm worth something to the franchise!"</TE>
<TE>   As you can tell by the smart-aleck gags, this is not a movie just
for fourth-graders. The Looney Tunes characters have a lot more in
common with Bart Simpson and Groucho Marx than with the more
homogenized sweetness of recent movie animation. "Most of the humor
in the original Looney Tunes cartoons was for adults," Dante
explains. "It's only in recent years that cartoon characters were
juvenalized. My 10-year-old niece can watch one of Tex Avery's Bugs
cartoons from 1943 and still laugh."</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Fraser has no illusions; he knows who's going to get the
big laughs. "You never get a punch line in a movie with a cartoon
character," he says with a grin. "You are the punch line. You just
try to make sure your eyes aren't crossed."</TE>
<TE>   Acting with a puppeteer</TE>
<TE>   It's a particularly difficult style of comedy to pull off, because
the film is being shot before the real stars -- Bugs, Daffy and
company -- have materialized. At rehearsals, Fraser and Elfman play
scenes with a puppeteer, who acts out the cartoon character's part,
armed with a life-sized rubber version of Bugs or Daffy. When the
camera rolls, Fraser and Elfman are on their own. "You have to use
your imagination," says Fraser. "But that's what makes it exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Before shooting each scene, Dante ponders: How much time does the
cartoon character need to, say, jump off a chair, grab a fork and run
out of the room? "Cartoons are fast," says Dante. "So the live action
has to adhere to the cartoon rhythm without seeming too manic." Size
and perspective are also a big issue. "The actors are 6 feet tall and
the cartoon characters are 3 feet tall," Dante explains. "So it's
always a challenge to get everyone's heads in the same shot."</TE>
<TE>   Dante knows he wasn't the studio's first choice -- he's directed
only two features in the last 10 years -- but it's hard to imagine
someone without his wealth of experience and affection for the
material handling the movie's daunting technical challenges. "I think
some of this would've been pretty difficult for the hot-shot music
video director they originally had in mind," he says. "Just before I
was offered the picture, [legendary Warner Bros. animator] Chuck
Jones passed away, and I felt it was the right thing to do. I didn't
want the picture to fall into the wrong hands."</TE>

<HD>'Superstar' lead off by at least a hair</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not the first time a rock 'n' roll singer has assumed the title
role in the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice musical "Jesus Christ
Superstar." Deep Purple's Ian Gillan sang the role on the first
"Superstar" album recording in 1970. Black Sabbath
session-singer-turned-born-again-Christian Jeffrey Fenholt portrayed
Jesus in the original Broadway production in 1971.</LD>
<LD>   This trivia comes via a quick Internet search by this confessed
rock illiterate to find out something about the latest
rocker-turned-Savior: Sebastian Bach. Formerly with the heavy metal
band Skid Row, Bach is currently starring in "Superstar" at La Mirada
Theatre for the Performing Arts.</LD>
<LD>   The baddest boy of this New Jersey rock group was Bach, who never
lived down a 1989 incident in which he hurled a bottle into a concert
crowd and cracked a girl's skull. That same year, he was photographed
wearing a T-shirt with a homophobic slogan. Skid Row members were
noted for their hair -- long, flowing, Harlequin-romance locks that
would send even Fabio running to a mirror to check for pattern
baldness. The hair was so integral to their act that more than one
rock writer described their style as "hair metal."</LD>
<TE>   Bach's amiable but ultimately misguided stage interpretation of
Jesus might best be described as "hair theater."</TE>
<TE>   You've got to give Bach -- 6 feet 3 and possessed of a stunning
blond mane -- credit for making a definitive choice: to play this
role as Jesus Christ, Rock Star, using all the tricks in his heavy
metal repertoire. Strutting his stuff, flipping his hair, turning all
the high notes into a rocker's attention-hungry screeches and howls;
all he's missing is an air guitar.</TE>
<TE>   Bach has also spent four months in 2000 on Broadway in "Jekyll &amp;
Hyde" and appeared as Riff-Raff in "The Rocky Horror Show," so this
is not his first theatrical outing. And, by the end of the second act
of "Superstar," he seems to be struggling earnestly to get past the
pop concert bravado and into something resembling a character. La
Mirada is the first tour stop for this production from McCoy Rigby
Entertainment; maybe he'll have it down by the time they hit
Kalamazoo, Mich., in February.</TE>
<TE>   Other performances -- more in the tradition of musical theater
than Bach's hard rock schlock -- shore up the show. Natalie Toro's
sweet voice and lusty personality combine for a winning Mary
Magdalene. Though he started off a little hoarse, Carl Anderson, who
has portrayed Judas on Broadway and on film, presents a riveting
portrait in pain and confusion. Smaller characters, including Lawson
Skala's deep-voiced Caiaphas, Stephen Breithaupt's Pilate and Peter
Kevoian's wickedly fey King Herod come across in sharp focus.</TE>
<TE>   This production, directed by Kevin Moriarty, is based on a recent
New York revival of the show directed by Gale Edwards, in which the
story is rocketed from the hippy-dippy early '70s to a contemporary
urban landscape fraught with graffiti, riot police and stockbrokers
dancing under glittering electronic signs reporting the upticks and
downturns of the market, including the latest from Enron. One might
argue that the update adds little to the story -- but the staging,
costumes and lighting design that accomplish this time warp are
triumphs of stage wizardry.</TE>

<HD>A verite look at Bush as candidate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi's mom has devotedly traipsed
around the country in the last year to attend five screenings of her
daughter's new documentary "Journeys With George." Sweet, but it also
gets her off the hook tonight, when the film has its HBO premiere.</LD>
<LD>   Mom -- also known as House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) -- can be forgiven for having her attention focused
elsewhere election night, on her own reelection results and the tight
battle for control of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   The 76-minute film tells what by now has become an old story in a
humorous new way: the staging of political campaigns for their press
value, the tedium of listening to the same stump speech over and
over, the pack mentality of the journalism and the uncomfortable
coziness that can develop between a campaign and the reporters
covering it.</LD>
<TE>   Alexandra Pelosi, assigned to be NBC News' constant producer on
the trail with candidate George W. Bush during his 1 1/2-year run-up
to the election, took along her home video camera. At some point the
candidate began to play along, providing the audience with a
less-formal glimpse of the man, rolling oranges down the aisle,
defending partying press members as "my people," giving Pelosi a kiss
on the cheek as an enticement to vote for him in the California
primary. Campaign over, Pelosi quit NBC to make her film with editor
Aaron Lubarsky.</TE>
<TE>   The film created a stir when it was the opening night film at the
South by Southwest festival in Texas in March of this year. HBO
picked it up a month later. Last week, producer Sid Ganis optioned
the film, with plans to make a fictionalized feature film version.</TE>
<TE>   At an interview before last week's New York screening, Nancy
Pelosi, one of Washington's most outspoken critics of Bush, looked
slightly horrified when asked if she gave her daughter any advice
during the making of the movie, perhaps fearful that she could be
accused of meddling in the politics. But for every critic who thinks
the president comes across poorly in the film as a frat boy at heart,
there has been another who thinks his clowning around for the younger
Pelosi's camera humanizes him.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't vote for him," said Sheila Nevins, HBO's
executive vice president, who acquired the documentary for the
network, "but I was charmed by the way he treated her."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences in San Francisco complained the film was "a valentine"
to Bush; Texas audiences thought it made their local hero look too
silly. In Oxford, England, recently, Nancy Pelosi even found herself
in the ironic position of defending the president. "I never
anticipated the partisan nature" of the reaction, the filmmaker said,
calling the film her "personal Rorschach test." Her mother adds that
in politics, "people see what they want to see."</TE>
<TE>   For the congresswoman, the film's success or failure in attracting
audiences tonight will be her own test of where the popular culture
stands when it comes to interest in elections. Will they be glued to
the movie or to the actual returns? "There's a theory that the main
event in politics is the presidential, and that's the only one that
really attracts the larger audience," she said.</TE>
<TE>   There is another element afoot because for many critics, it's not
a film about the candidate but about the process. The filmmaker's Web
site says the film "exposes the unholy alliance between the reporters
and the candidate and deconstructs how we elect our presidents." So
what does that say about her mother's own run for office?</TE>
<TE>   "There can be a massive manipulation of the media," Nancy Pelosi
said, copping to past campaigns, when she was head of the California
Democratic Party. "We wanted to make sure the press was happy; we
wanted to make sure they had all the information that they needed to
do their job, that they were well fed and if there was a baseball
game or football game going on, that they would have access. We
didn't want them to be unhappy."</TE>
<TE>   The congresswoman argued, however, that "the dangerous part is not
how you schmooze them, it's how you can grant and withhold; the power
of allocation of time, of questions, is major." The film, she said,
"demonstrates clearly how a campaign can shape the story and how the
story can impact a presidency and the outcome of an election." One
scene shows the future president turning frosty toward the filmmaker
after she asks a pointed question about the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Pelosi mere is vague when asked whether she would ever allow
someone like her daughter to have similar up-close access to her own
campaign. There's not the same level of interest in nonpresidential
races, she said, and "I would never run for president, so that whole
intimacy of a year and a half of that kind of thing, it's hard to say
what you would do." But she said "the question will be a very
different one in two years; it's not a question of if they will allow
it, it's a question of why wouldn't they allow it.... That's what
public figures should come to expect."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's the opportunity to close down any more,"
she added. "If a candidate does not want to be reported on, he'll
stay at the front of the plane. And the fact is that making himself
available to the press, even to be the subject of a documentary, was
a good thing for George Bush, in terms of the media coverage that he
got."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the filmmaker said she got two pieces of advice from
her mother: to be prepared for the strong reactions she would get
from putting her own ideas in the public realm and to have respect
for the institution of the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never any moment when I stepped over the line," Alexandra
Pelosi said. "I'm not tearing anybody down. The thing I'm proudest of
is that I didn't burn any bridges."</TE>
<TE>   She says she remains friends with her fellow reporters and retains
good contacts with the White House. "I did play the politics of it. I
kept my relationships with everybody," she added. "I am my mother's
daughter."</TE>

<HD>Atwater Village: Paint it hip</HD>

<LD>The grand opening of a paint store in Atwater Village is a difficult
event to categorize in social calendar terms. It does not, for
example, rate paparazzi. But there was actually quite a lot going on,
symbolically speaking, at Jill's Paints on its inaugural Saturday
afternoon. Worlds collided, alliances solidified, the urban landscape
changed and Barry Diller wasn't anywhere near the joint.</LD>
<LD>   Billed as a high-end paint store with an emphasis on old-fashioned
service, Jill's Paints starts off with a pretty high David and
Goliath factor. Proprietor Peg McCloud runs Jill of All Trades, a
well-known, mostly female paint crew working in Silver Lake and its
environs. She decided to open her store when Baker's Hardware, a
landmark just off Los Feliz Boulevard, closed earlier this year.</LD>
<LD>   For one thing, she needed a place to buy the Benjamin Moore paint
she favors, and the next closest vendor was on La Brea. For another,
she thought people were getting pretty sick of wandering like lost
souls through the humming fluorescence of mega-stores like Home
Depot. And finally, she figured that if her friend Kim Dingle could
open Fatty's, a successful coffeehouse in Eagle Rock, then she, Peg,
could open a successful paint store in Atwater Village.</LD>
<TE>   Which is where the symbolism goes beyond consumer trends and into
the choppier waters of tribe, because, like Eagle Rock, Atwater
Village is one of those borderline neighborhoods, perpetually on the
cusp of "hot."</TE>
<TE>   At the recent grand-opening of Jill's Paints, the crowd pretty
much divided at the door. Inside, a Silver Lake-ish crowd -- women
with Joan of Arc hair, men in good thrift-store sports jackets, state
Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg -- ate stuffed chicken breast and spicy
orange shrimp amid the paint cans.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, at tables set up for the event, the doyennes of Atwater
Village held court. Betty Bartlotta, owner of the venerably colorful
Club Tee Gee, accepted the first marguerita she had drunk in a year,
flanked by Laura McLaughlin, advertising manager for the Atwater
Village Residents Assn. newsletter, and Barbara Lass, a director of
the association. Though none was around in the early early days, when
Walt Disney and Tom Mix had studios here, they've all lived here for
30 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   Like any good barkeep, Bartlotta can capture in a few words what
many an urban sociologist would need a book contract to explain.
"When I moved here, you had to wait for someone to die to buy a
house," she says. "It was a retirement community. Then the immigrants
came and there were a lot of empty stores on the boulevard. Then the
gays moved in, and they take such good care of their houses. Now it's
the Silver Lake crowd."</TE>
<TE>   "We are definitely moving forward," says McLaughlin, who is a bit
more overtly boosterish than her friends. "There are so many eclectic
places to go. There are two bakeries on the boulevard now. We've got
a new Cuban restaurant, a real cafe and the yoga place."</TE>
<TE>   The "boulevard" is Glendale Boulevard. The mile of it that rises
from the L.A. river before ducking beneath the train overpass is the
heart of Atwater Village. It is a wide street--divided by a
tree-studded median--and while it does not have the groomed look of
gentrification, it is not as shabby as it was even three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Pampered Birds, the pet store in the former movie theater, is no
longer the only colorful facade on the block. In the last year, half
a dozen new establishments have joined longtime tenants like the Tee
Gee, the Racket Doctor, Dave's Accordion Lessons, the Dutch American
Bakery and Osteria Nonni restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "There are new places opening up all the time," says Bartlotta.
"We had Huell Howser out here a while ago," she adds, her no-nonsense
mien brightening at the mere pleasure of saying the name.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a couple of people come over from Silver Lake," adds
McLaughlin, including Silver Lake Video and the two-chair Stardust
Salon, which provides everything from a wave and set to a tri-colored
Mohawk.</TE>
<TE>   All of this might sound like small potatoes to denizens of
consumer meccas like Santa Monica or even Larchmont. But for years
now, Atwater has jockeyed for position on the next-hip neighborhood
list. For years, residents have watched their neighbors in Silver
Lake and Los Feliz complain like world-weary prom queens about the
downsides of popularity -- oh, the parking is just impossible, and
the wait at La Belle Epoque.</TE>
<TE>   For years, people like Bartlotta and McLaughlin have waited and
hoped, holding their breath as things seemed just about to turn --
home-grown Out of the Closet went citywide, the Bigfoot Lodge was
anointed by the arbiters of club-chic, Osteria Nonni continued to
draw crowds from all over the city, even the river got a make-over.</TE>
<TE>   All over the L.A. basin, neighborhoods were turning: Eagle Rock
got a few coffeehouses and the press went mad, Echo Park pulled
together a few galleries and suddenly was the next SoHo. Meanwhile,
Atwater Village, with its pretty tree-lined residential streets and
wide main drag, clung to the Tam O'Shanter and tried to keep its
spirits high.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it may be happening. Housing prices are rising, not just
with the general tide but with people priced out of Silver Lake, Los
Feliz, Franklin Hills, even Hollywood. The newcomers are
professionals -- lawyers and studio people, artists who actually make
a living, staff from the local hospitals -- and they want the stuff,
the businesses they're used to.</TE>
<TE>   So now the longtime blue-collar hood has Kaldi, a cafe so
post-ironic it hawks herbal elixirs alongside Ding Dongs. It has
Samadhi, a store devoted to candles that come in three colors and
four fragrances, and Bikram's Yoga Silver Lake. And now it has a
paint store that stocks Martha Stewart, where a customer need not
imagine a whole living room based on a Scrabble-tile-sized sample
because there are wee tins for sale, and for one line, adorable
palm-sized packets of paint.</TE>
<TE>   McCloud wants customers to think of her store as a place to set a
spell, to chat with the salespeople, to find not only paint and
rollers but electricians and plumbers, paint and floor crews.</TE>
<TE>   There will be coffee, from Fatty's of course, and eventually, if
McCloud has her way, a wine bar. There's even a house barbecue sauce:
Rattlesnake Barbecue Sauce, made by McLaughlin's husband, which used
to be available at Baker's.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Jill's to be just like an old-fashioned store in a small
town," McCloud says.</TE>
<TE>   Which is, in a nutshell, the thing that makes a neighborhood turn
these days: the creation of a small town. A small high-end town. A
small high-end town full of city folk who want both the Dutch
coffeecake and the nonfat double-shot cappuccino, who seek both the
hip and the homey. The kind of people who want Goliath to run the
world but David to do the interiors.</TE>

<HD>Fresh and lively 'Cantigas'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dating from the 13th century, "Cantigas de Santa Maria" (Songs to the
Virgin Mary) are no musty antiquarian oddities. At least, not in the
care of the Boston Camerata, the Camerata Mediterranea and the Sharq
Arab-American Ensemble on Sunday at UCLA's Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Introduced drolly from the stage by Joel Cohen, who directs both
cameratas, these vernacular Spanish songs, collected and preserved at
the court of Spanish King Alfonso X (1221-1284), are lively folk
songs and dances refitted with Christian texts; the music has roots
as well in Islamic and Jewish Iberian traditions.</LD>
<LD>   The "Cantigas" tell stories of miracles wrought by the Virgin Mary
-- a corrupt judge given one last chance, a simple monk who sprouts
five glorious roses from his mouth. They also included praise songs.</LD>
<TE>   Singers Hayet Ayad, Anne Azema, Equidad Bares and Lynn Torgove
separately and in various combinations told the stories as vivid,
fresh, almost gossipy events.</TE>
<TE>   The singers were supposed to be accompanied by the Andalusian
Orchestra of Fez, Morocco, but only that ensemble's leader, violinist
Mohammed Briouel, got a visa. Cohen put him together with Boston's
Sharq Arab-American ensemble, made up of Kareen Roustom (oud) and
percussionists Boujourmaa Razgui and Karim Nagi Mohammed. One vielle
(a kind of violin) player was imported from Britain, Hazel Brooks.
Camerata members Cohen (lauta) and Shira Kammen (vielle) also played.
The substitute instrumentalists, with just a week to prepare before
the seven-city U.S. "Cantigas" tour, shined.</TE>

<HD>Film on Florida vote counted out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Donna Perlmutter</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles will see it. The same goes for San Francisco, New York,
Philadelphia and many other U.S. cities. But PBS stations in most
markets won't be showing "Counting On Democracy," a pointed
documentary on the 2000 presidential election mishaps in Florida that
is being shown tonight on those select PBS stations.</LD>
<LD>   PBS chose instead to carry "Who Counts," featuring "Saturday Night
Live's" Darrell Hammond and others, hosted by former CNN bureau chief
Frank Sesno. It explores the election breakdown by making light of
it.</LD>
<LD>   And this preference rankles Danny Schechter, who, together with
Faye Anderson, wrote and produced "Counting On Democracy," airing at
10 p.m. on KCET.</LD>
<TE>   But PBS' decision didn't stop him or Independent Television
Service -- which partly funded his low-budget film and licensed it
for airing on public television -- from going station-to-station with
it as a way of getting screenings.</TE>
<TE>   He believes it's what's on the film that enticed those stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Our film ... is not about Gore or Bush," he says. "It's about the
still-outraged voters of Florida and all Americans who watched what
happened there with disgust and embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knows who won, officially," says Schechter, a veteran of
left-wing politics and media who makes no effort to hide his beliefs
on the election confusion. "But few realize how many voters lost, or
that a whopping 175,000 Florida ballots went uncounted in an election
that turned on 537 votes when the Supreme Court stepped in. Even
fewer know about the 25,000 purges from the voter rolls or how the
recount in key counties was undermined, if not deliberately delayed,
and, in effect, sabotaged."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter's comments notwithstanding, PBS senior vice president
and co-chief program executive John F. Wilson says that the network
didn't need both, "and we had accepted the one ['Who Counts'] before
the other was even offered to us."</TE>
<TE>   "Counting On Democracy," which is narrated by Ossie Davis and Ruby
Dee, uses as context the fight for black voting rights. The husband
and wife were chosen in part because of their work in the civil
rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Schechter is an Emmy-winning television producer and independent
filmmaker who has made more than 200 magazine shows for PBS stations,
50 segments for ABC's "20/20" and was on the start-up team at CNN.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to show the failures across the board," he says. "The
media's failure to investigate and expose what really went on. The
Democrats' many failures, in how they bungled the situation. The
institutional failures, in not looking at obvious voter intent on a
ballot, for instance, which Florida law prescribes."</TE>
<TE>   All this was abandoned, he claims, when the Bush administration
advised everyone to "move on." As Congressman John Lewis says in the
film: "People died for the right to vote. And we should forget about
it? We shouldn't make too much of it? How can you sweep it under the
rug like it didn't happen?"</TE>
<TE>   But Schechter puts the biggest share of the blame on the media,
which he says gladly agreed to move on, "because once it is announced
that a story is over, no one wants to be thought of as stepping
outside the consensus."</TE>
<TE>   Included in the documentary is a report from Greg Palast, an
investigative journalist for the BBC, the Guardian and Observer, who
went to Florida immediately after the election. According to his
reporting, the process of purging voters from the registration rolls
in largely black, Democratic counties was flawed, inaccurate and
needed further follow-up.</TE>
<TE>   Schechter maintains that Americans were not exposed to this depth
of information. His disappointment, though, lies not just with
commercial media mired in "all-Monica-all-the-time or
all-sniper-all-the-time" reporting -- but with public broadcasting,
"which is supposed to be serving the public interest."</TE>

<HD>Rolling Stones stick out their tongues at fashion</HD>
<DH>The legendary band's latest line of Rockware has lots of
attitude but not much innovation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The spry Mick Jagger strutted into the party with bandmates Charlie
Watts, Ron Wood and an imposing British bodyguard in tow. It was
Sunday night, day three of L.A.'s Fashion Week, and the band took the
night off to debut its latest line of Rolling Stones Rockware with a
tent party and fashion show in Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The tent was crowded with self-conscious designers and a varied
sampling of celebrities (Jewel, Farrah Fawcett, David LaChapelle).
Jagger moved through the place like static electricity. Before the
show, he was up and over the catwalk in a heartbeat, jogging from
group to group, hugging people. Then he was reprimanding his
bodyguard for manhandling the waiter as he tried to order a drink
(cranberry over ice).</LD>
<LD>   Soon, a series of willowy models appeared, many of them topless in
G-strings, wearing the band's tongue and lips logo in the most
unexpected places. Jagger and Wood jumped up and down, clapping at
the young women like adolescents. "I was just vibing them up, you
know, getting them going, " Jagger said later as he stood backstage
surrounded by half-naked models. "I'm a good audience as well as a
good performer."</LD>
<TE>   The line -- designed with Jagger's help by the Andy Warhol
Foundation, the high-end London lingerie company Agent Provocateur,
trendy T-shirt label Buddhist Punk and L.A.-based rock 'n' roll
lifestyle brand Chrome Hearts -- offered a creative take on the
traditional concert merchandising deal. It also marks another
successful use of fashion as marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit more involved than we've done before," said Jagger of
this year's line. "It's very rock 'n' roll. It's hard. It's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the new collection of leather jackets, lingerie, jewelry
and other accessories incorporating the logo wasn't especially
innovative. But the rhinestone G-strings, safety-pinned T-shirts,
animal prints and dangling chains were huge crowd pleasers. The
show's Stones soundtrack, including "Shattered" and "Sympathy for the
Devil," set an appropriately rebellious mood for the models, many of
whom greeted the crowd with sneers.</TE>
<TE>   Catwalk cameos by rock-progeny-about-town Jack Osbourne and his
new best friend, Kimberly Stewart, drew loud cheers from the
audience, who warmed up under the chilly tent by sipping generous
mai-tais.</TE>
<TE>   On the media line before the show, designers, film directors and
actors tried to define the cultural significance of the Rolling
Stones. Val Kilmer, who appeared to have just risen from a nap,
mumbled several monosyllabic answers into a camera crew's microphone
and moved on. "He's just full of sound bites," one man noted. Actress
Natasha Henstridge remarked sagely that the new collection "is going
to take 20 years off the Rolling Stones." Director Brett Ratner, who
is developing a film with a Stones tour as backdrop, quipped: "It's
all about the lips." But photographer David LaChapelle synthesized
all these ideas: "The Rolling Stones were kind of like the epitome of
cool."</TE>

<LD>The relationship was "real," Nicole Kidman insists -- disputing media
reports that her bond with ex-husband Tom Cruise was a marriage of
convenience.</LD>
<LD>   "The marriage existed because it was two people in love," she says
in the December issue of Vanity Fair. "It's that simple. They said
I'm gay, they've said everyone's gay. I personally don't believe in
doing huge lawsuits about that stuff. Tom [Cruise] does."</LD>
<LD>   The passion was so great that she was willing to have a baby with
him without tying the knot, which is what she wishes she had done. "I
was willing to give up everything," she recalls. "I do it when I do a
movie too. I'm willing to go, 'Yeah, bring it on, consume me,
intoxicate me.' I want to feel alive -- I want to reel, basically."</LD>
<TE>   Her life "collapsed" after the breakup, Kidman concedes. So much
so that she was in a fetal position, weeping on the floor, when her
parents came to get her. Professionally, she felt ostracized by the
show business community who figured "it's over for her now."
Scientology didn't figure into the split, she maintains, though she
never did embrace it. More problematic was the harsh glare of the
spotlight because she felt she was there as "Tom's wife."</TE>
<TE>   Though it feels good to be immersed in her work right now, the
previous package was her preference. "This makes me sad, but I still
would probably choose a marriage and an intact family over my
career," she said. " ... I didn't have to have a huge career. I would
have liked to be able to make a 'To Die For' occasionally and things
that could stimulate me."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco Opera has been slapped with a $70,000 fine by the
California Occupational Safety and Health Administration after a June
27 accident in which stagehand Francis Kenny, 43, suffered a broken
leg and head trauma after falling 22 feet from a hydraulic lift while
removing scenery.</LD>
<LD>   Cal-OSHA has cited the opera for allegedly knowing it was
improperly using the lift when it tipped over, causing Kenny to crash
to the floor. The organization charges that the opera committed a
"willful serious violation" by taking off two of the lift's four
stabilizing "outriggers," or legs, to fit into a tight space.</LD>
<LD>   Though the opera's technical director, Peter Markle, was
unavailable for comment Monday, but told the San Francisco Chronicle
that "since the day of the accident, the Opera has been working very
closely with Cal-OSHA and will continue to do so." He also declared
that the opera provides an environment that is "as safe as other
theaters' " for its workers. An opera spokeswoman said that the
company took the accident extremely seriously and hired a safety
consultant after the mishap.</LD>
<TE>   Kenny is recuperating at home and plans to return to work after
rehabilitation.</TE>

<LD>Despite a new contract with MTV, Sharon Osbourne says she's calling
it quits after this season on the top-rated cable show "The
Osbournes."</LD>
<LD>   "We can't do it anymore," she tells Barbara Walters in a "20/20"
interview airing Wednesday. "Another 10 shows and I'm out."</LD>

wouldn't choose to do again, says Osbourne, whose bout with colon
cancer will be an integral part of the story line.</LD>

us all.... The cameras are here all the time so it's a little

<HD>Campaign tragedy in the tail winds</HD>
<DH>After a senator's deadly crash, frequent-flying candidates
fight the jitters and soldier on.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Louise Roug</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>It was a combination of lasagna, Mexican food, candy corn and
campaigning. After several weeks of blitzing the state, the candidate
looked worn out. He even had to cancel most of his Friday stops. Just
a week earlier, U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone's plane had crashed in
Minnesota, but Ron Kirk couldn't afford to think too much about it.
Like other candidates across the country, the Democratic contender
for a U.S. Senate seat was getting on and off small planes, flying
several thousands of miles across Texas as the election entered its
final hours.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Saturday begins before 6 a.m. It is still dark and raining when
Windle Turley, an attorney, parks his burgundy Jaguar convertible at
Dallas' Love Field Airport, just north of the city. As the owner of a
Citation Cessna, one of two planes chartered by Kirk's campaign that
day, he wants to make sure everything is OK.</LD>
<TE>   Kirk's schedule for the day: Dallas, San Antonio, El Paso,
McAllen, Brownsville, Houston. Without leaving the state, the former
mayor of Dallas will fly through two time zones and three climates,
from the westernmost point of the state to the Gulf of Mexico. "He's
going to cover a lot of ground," Turley says as he goes to talk to
the pilot, "but that's the life of a politician."</TE>
<TE>   And it's been the death of several in the last 10 years, among
them Mel Carnahan, governor of Missouri; South Dakota Gov. George
Mickelson; and Pennsylvania Sen. John Heinz. Although no one is eager
to talk about the most recent casualty, it has raised the anxiety
level among Kirk's entourage.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rachel Graves, a reporter with the Houston Chronicle, pulls up in
a cab. "The first time seems glamorous, but the glamour wears off
when the pilot's climbing over you to get to the cockpit," she says
of the traveling.</TE>
<TE>   Just days earlier, she had looked at lightning below and the stars
above, the plane caught in bad weather. "It feels a lot different on
a tiny plane," she says. "It's the difference between a motorcycle
and an SUV."</TE>
<TE>   Gromer Jeffers of the Dallas Morning News has traveled with Kirk
for months. Even before Wellstone's death, he says, Kirk talked about
flying and mortality in the same breath. "He has said to his family,
'When I go, it'll probably be in a plane.' "</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Falkenberg, with Associated Press, arrives in another cab.
The day after Wellstone's crash, the Dallas bureau chief had told
her, "Don't go if it's a small plane and they only have one pilot."
When she got to the airstrip, she found a small plane with one pilot.
But despite the admonition from her boss, Falkenberg had little
choice if she wanted to cover the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen again in the same election cycle,"
Graves says as she goes inside to get coffee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Justin Lonon, Kirk's press secretary, talks to the pilot on the
wet runway. The reporters overhear a snippet about "issues with the
plane."</TE>
<TE>   "They just said, 'We've got a couple ... ' A couple of what?" asks
Graves. "Gallons of gas?"</TE>
<TE>   Falkenberg counters: "Parachutes."</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour later, the plane is off, rising above the rain.
Lonon, who has spent the better part of the last 10 months on planes
such as this, talks about his 18-month-old daughter. She "calls me
'daddy-bye-bye,' " he says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The plane touches down in San Antonio to pick up Henry Cisneros,
the former mayor of San Antonio and secretary of Housing and Urban
Development. Kirk, who insists on carrying his own bags, has
relegated the nicer of the two planes to Cisneros, along for two
campaign stops. The plush Cessna Citation travels 506 miles an hour
as the early morning sun gives a golden glow to the clouds, like
pulled cotton.</TE>
<TE>   Cisneros chats with the reporters, who are passing cough drops
around. Everyone is feeling under the weather. "When I was traveling
with Clinton, everybody got so sick," he says. "I would joke, we
should put a red cross on the plane. It was like a traveling
hospital." Another casualty of six or more stops every day is one's
sense of place, Cisneros says. And as the plane lands on a strip
surrounded by red desert, he jokingly says, as if to remind himself:
"El Paso. We're here for Ron Kirk."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Later, Cisneros talks to a crowd of about 100 gathered at an
airport hangar in McAllen. They chant, "Si, se puede" -- "Yes, we
can," the official motto of the campaign. Near the small podium, Kirk
is waiting for his turn to speak. His lips are moving. "McAllen.
McAllen," he seems to whisper to himself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Brownsville, a small city on the Gulf of Mexico, it's 78
degrees and humid. Kirk is talking to a reporter about the Wellstone
crash. It made him extra cautious, he says -- and, as father of two
girls, less likely to travel with his wife, Matrice.</TE>
<TE>   Here at an abandoned mall, hundreds have come out for him, the
local Democratic ticket, tamales and Mazz, a popular Tejano band.
"The state is just so big, I can't touch enough people," he says
later. Still, in this dead-heat race against state Atty. Gen. John
Cornyn for retiring Sen. Phil Gramm's seat, this is what he has to
do. "All the candidates go, because if you stop, you collapse," he
says. "I don't want to wake up on Nov. 6 and say, 'If we had only --
we might have.' I want to finish on empty."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   En route to the airstrip in Brownsville, one of the nameless
drivers shuttling the candidate and his entourage from airport to
rally, rally to airport, points out the Blue Mermaid, the best place
in town for fried alligator gar, a river fish. After a few more
miles, he pulls up at a shack at the end of a gravel road. This is
the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   The reporters need three phone lines to file their stories, but,
walking up the soggy blue carpet to the shack with moldy ceilings,
they have little faith that they will find even one. Surprisingly,
all meet their deadlines, and a few minutes later pile into the plane
parked outside.</TE>
<TE>   Already on board, Kirk swats flies with a newspaper before
takeoff. During ascent, he remarks on the beauty of the swamp below
before closing his eyes for a nap. As an air pocket dips the plane,
he makes an involuntary motion as if falling.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That night, at a mansion in an upscale Houston neighborhood,
Stevie Wonder gives a speech. It's 48 degrees and raining, and about
80 people have come to support Kirk. Standing under a white tent in
the garden, Wonder asks for a few moments of silence for Wellstone.
Kirk bows his head.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A little later, a handler drives the candidate to the downtown
Hyatt. It's an early night. Sunday, he gets back on the plane.</TE>

<HD>A new 'Kat'a' is born: Mattila shows her power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>With the widely praised American premiere of Messiaen's "Saint
Francois d'Assise" selling out at San Francisco Opera last month, the
company's new general director, Pamela Rosenberg, proved that there
is an audience for challenging opera. But fears persist that this
unapologetically intellectual impresario will alienate the city's
traditional opera supporters, who think of the War Memorial Opera
House as a venue for star singers and a playground for high society
rather than a home for vital theater. And she will need to keep
pulling in audiences to deal with a recently announced $7.7-million
deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenberg's second new production, Janacek's "Kat'a Kabanova,"
which opened Sunday afternoon, falls into her long-range plans to
investigate opera about women who are "laws unto themselves"; it is
also part of a Janacek cycle. She has brought in a fashionable German
production team -- director Johannes Schaaf, set designer Erich
Wonder and costume designer Falko Herold -- to give the drama's
sexuality a postmodern edge.</LD>
<LD>   Still, San Francisco's avid canary fanciers need not worry. What
really sets apart this "Kat'a" is singing. Assuming the title role
for the first time, Karita Mattila turns in a performance of such
shattering dramatic power and stunning vocal assurance that it seems
certain Kat'a will become associated with her forevermore.</LD>
<TE>   This superb Finnish soprano has been slowly climbing the operatic
star ladder, most notably in her outstanding portrayal of Leonora in
the Metropolitan Opera's recent production of "Fidelio." But with
"Kat'a," she has really arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Kat'a is most certainly a woman who stands outside the repressive
society of 19th century Russia, where the opera takes place, although
it is staged here on a set that looks more like something out of
modern Ingmar Berman film. Oppressed by her icy cruel mother-in-law,
Kabanicha, and stifled by her weak husband, Tichon, she simply
explodes sexually. Religious ecstasy turns into erotic extramarital
release, and it consumes her. She is not so much a law unto herself
as the internal battlefield between the laws of nature and her
society.</TE>
<TE>   The temptation is to treat Kat'a as a sensitive, sensual hysteric
driven to distraction. Janacek's music, with its melodic and rhythmic
fragments that seem as agile as thought and emotion themselves,
inspire a fractured look at consciousness. Mattila, however, presents
Kat'a as never out of control. As she battles for Tichon's
affections, it is she, not the vicious mother-in-law, who is in
control.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the opera when Mattila, with searing authority,
likens the release of singing birds to her own sexual release, it is
a moment of blinding triumph. She then throws herself in the river,
not out of desperation but as a heroic sacrifice, a gesture to awaken
others dead to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Wonder's towering, schematic set is not necessarily a singer's
friend, often making the characters look inconsequential. But he does
surprisingly interesting things with it, especially in projecting
images of the Volga on the scrims. Herold's costumes range from
striking to dull to a nuisance -- in the notes he talks about all the
movies he's been influenced by and, sure enough, the women of the
Kabanova household have "Star Wars" hair; the villagers carry "Women
of the Dunes" umbrellas, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Schaaf seems a bit overwhelmed by Mattila's searing
self-possession, trying too hard at times to make her seem
vulnerable. But Janacek's score doesn't have a wasted second, and for
the most part the director serves up a tense drama.</TE>
<TE>   Kabanicha is so malicious that typically she steals the show.
Hanna Schwarz, sounding as robust as ever, is dominating enough that
she too might have done so against any singer less commanding than
Mattila. Next to these formidable women, the weak and depraved men in
the opera haven't a chance. Richard Decker, though, is an unusually
anguished Tichon; Albert Bonnema offers a moderately radiant Boris
(Kat'a's lover); Victor Chernomortsev is a vividly boorish Dickoj
(Boris' merchant uncle). The couple Varvara (Uta Doring) and Kudrjas
(Raymond Very) are, not inappropriately, lightweight. The orchestra
needs a few more performances to settle into Janacek's demanding
score but, at its best, under Donald Runnicles' driven yet warm
conducting, it was impressive.</TE>

<HD>'Solaris' gets R rating; appeal vowed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Steven Soderbergh vowed Monday to appeal a restrictive R
rating the Motion Picture Assn. of America has assigned to his
outer-space romantic drama, "Solaris," for "some sexuality/nudity."
Two scenes depict actor George Clooney's naked backside.</LD>
<LD>   "We all agreed that we are not going to cut the film," Soderbergh
said, referring to executives at 20th Century Fox, which plans to
open the movie Nov. 27.</LD>
<LD>   "We've seen scenes like this on network television," Soderbergh
noted by phone from New Orleans, where he is mixing the film's
soundtrack. "Believe me, there is nothing here that is worse than
what has been on 'NYPD Blue' " on ABC.</LD>
<TE>   The Oscar-winning director of "Traffic" said the scenes in
question are not really sexual. In one, Clooney and co-star Natascha
McElhone, who plays Clooney's wife, are shown slow-dancing in an
extremely darkened room, "shot from 70 feet away."In another shot, he
said, they are in bed on their stomachs, talking. " "Again, it's
night and very dark."</TE>
<TE>   The director said he plans to meet with the MPAA appeals board at
the end of next week to contest the R, which prohibits admission of
anyone younger than 18 who isn't accompanied by a parent or adult.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA spokesman Richard Taylor said the ratings are determined by a
panel consisting largely of parents. The appeals board consists of
between 14 and 18 members from various studios. A two-thirds vote is
required to overturn the rating.</TE>
<TE>   Soderbergh said the rating illustrates an "ongoing issue" with the
Directors Guild of America: Some R-rated films like "Almost Famous"
and "Billy Elliott" lean more to the softer PG-13 rating than R-rated
films like "Fight Club" or "Total Recall."</TE>
<TE>   In "Solaris," Soderbergh said, Clooney is investigating unusual
phenomena on a space station. "As the story progresses, he is visited
by what appears to be his dead ex-wife," the director said. "It's a
love story."</TE>

<CX>   "Solaris" rating -- A story in Tuesday's Calendar about the rating
given to "Solaris" said an R rating prohibits viewers younger than 18
unless they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In fact, the
rating means "Restricted: Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian."</CX>

<LD>Later this month we will celebrate Thanksgiving. The main dish at a
traditional Thanksgiving meal is usually turkey, accompanied by
vegetables, stuffing, gravy and pumpkin pie for dessert. These days,
most people go to the grocery store or supermarket to buy food. But
that hasn't always been the case.</LD>
<LD>   This 1882 painting by French artist Camille Pissarro, "Poultry
Market at Pontoise," captures a busy, crowded market scene. All
things related to poultry (birds) are sold here: eggs, chickens,
ducks, geese and, yes, turkeys. Try to imagine the sounds and smells
in the market. Why do you think the artist wanted to make a painting
in a place like this?</LD>
<LD>   Pissarro was especially interested in painting outdoor scenes on
the spot. This painting gives us the sense that we are right there at
the market. Notice how he focuses on people -- the farm women and men
patiently waiting to sell their birds and eggs, as well as the mob of
people who come to shop. After the market closes, the farmers and
shoppers will go home and share delicious meals with their families.</LD>
<TE>   The Norton Simon Museum invites you to its Thanksgiving-related
family day celebration, "The Bounty From the Earth," from 2 to 3 p.m.
Nov. 16. For more information, call (626) 844-6980 or visit

<KH>SPRING 2003 / L.A. FASHION WEEK</KH>
<HD>Making a splash</HD>
<DH>L.A. designers are out to prove that they're the ones who
define California style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles designers are not about to let outsiders define
California style, which has been ripped off all over the globe
lately. They struck back (mostly with success) over the weekend in
the first of their spring 2003 runway shows. Chanel's surfboards
don't have much on Jennifer Nicholson's flouncy seashell-print party
dresses, Eisbar's palm tree-and-sunset T-shirts; David Cardona's rock
n' roll leather evening gown and Ashley Paige's pink crocheted
bikini.</LD>
<LD>   Logistically, there were enough glitches to make next season's
promise of a central location for the shows at the downtown Standard
hotel all the sweeter. Events were held so far apart (Venice,
downtown, Hollywood) that someone hoping to make it to all six shows
Saturday would have logged more than 60 miles on the odometer. And
the fire marshal was none too pleased when more than 1,000 people
clamored to get into the Jeremy Scott show, held in the atrium of the
Geffen Contemporary museum, a space that is supposed to hold only
about 300. Still, the fervor surrounding Scott's encore presentation
of September's New York show was proof that this town is hungry for
more fashion.</LD>
<TE>   With the spotlight about to be turned on L.A. fashion week, some
designers will need some polishing to create full, cohesive
collections worthy of world attention. Still, there were enough
sparks of inspiration on the runways this weekend to keep the motor
running.</TE>
<TE>   After just two collections, Nicholson is on her way to becoming
the Betsey Johnson of the West thanks to her "girls just wanna have
fun" sensibility. Flirty, bias-cut sundresses were the centerpieces
of her show held Saturday at a Market Street art gallery in Venice.
One of her best was done in cream silk with a dramatic blue wave on
the front, evoking surf and sea. There were also separates for Malibu
princesses -- metallic leather motorcycle jackets, tuxedo pants with
sequin stripes down the legs and skirts, pants and dresses covered in
"watch me shimmy" fringe.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Jackson was the guest of honor at Cardona's presentation at
the Hancock Park home of his publicist's parents. The two
collaborated on Jackson's 1998 "Velvet Rope" tour. Her presence
announced the continuation of his rock n' roll-meets-society maven
style. Cardona has a way with leather. His clothes were sexy, but not
sleazy -- nothing that would create a stir at the neighboring
Wilshire Country Club: a full skirt in beige suede, a caramel leather
notch-lapel jacket, a sand-colored sleeveless suede shirtdress with a
stand-away collar and the finale, a full-length black leather gown
with a ragged skirt.</TE>
<TE>   "I like his strong shoulders and clean lines," said Jackson, who
wore a newsboy cap and leather pants. The Petro Zillia collection, by
L.A. native Nony Tochterman, was inspired by the 1960s. Patchwork
prairie skirts, provencal flower-print bell bottoms and sky blue,
Aztec print-chiffon skirts were trimmed in ruffles, rickrack and
ribbon, and paired with featherweight knit camisoles. Tochterman also
came up with some cool shoes -- strappy clog sandals that lace up to
the knee.</TE>
<TE>   In their MartinMARTIN collection, spouses Eric Martin and Diane
Moss-Martin were again caught in the spell of Japan's Yohji Yamamoto
and Rei Kawakubo, swathing bodies in voluminous skirts with ragged
hems. Unstructured jackets had pinned armholes and peplums that were
literally cut away in the back, and evening gowns were tailored
haphazardly to the body, with strips of fabric stitched into abstract
rosettes at the waist. The ideas were original when they were hatched
in the 1980s to challenge traditional notions of dressmaking, but the
designers have done little to advance them.</TE>
<TE>   At Nikolaki, Los Feliz design duo Nick Verreos and David Paul
showed why a pop star like Nikka Costa and actors like Patricia
Arquette have started coming to them for body-hugging silk charmeuse
pieces. Their entrance makers included a cream-chocolate
brown-and-coral striped blouse with a cowl that cascaded down the
back, and a tawny gown with a plunging neckline and batwing sleeves.
Ill-fitting Edwardian jackets, however, suggest a need for more work
on fit.</TE>
<TE>   Gen Art, the New York-based nonprofit that supports emerging
artists, showcased eight designers chosen by a committee of local
stylists, retailers and press. The best of the bunch included rising
star Kate O'Connor's slinky knit jumpsuit and open-back gown; Ya-Ya's
black net bomber jacket and pink silk cargo pants; Antonio Aguilar's
one-shoulder, lace-back jackets; Paige's pink crochet bikini and a
pink straw micro mini; and a curiously sexy navy-and-white striped
rugby gown from Louis Verdad.</TE>
<TE>   At the group show put on by the Coalition of Los Angeles
Designers, Eisbar designers Bobby Benveniste and Kiernan Lambeth
mixed surf and street, creating T-shirts with beachy graphics, jeans
in a paint stroke wash and a fun interpretation of Nicolas
Ghesquiere's famous cargo pants for Balenciaga in black canvas with
navy blue stripes winding up the leg. Mona Thalheimer's feathery
lavender chiffon circle skirt and elegant surplice jacket for Mona &amp;
Co. were elegant and wearable.</TE>
<TE>   Mhope, a line designed by CLAD president Darren Gold and Marla
Folbe, attempted the 1950s happy homemaker look with a fuchsia silk
tweed housedress and a boxy pink terry-cloth jumpsuit, but some
pieces had an unfortunate homemade look.</TE>
<TE>   Octavio Carlin's overheated collection of silk charmeuse evening
gowns, Naqada, would have benefited from a little restraint. One gown
had French lace sleeves, a draped back, a train and a thick, braided
sash. Boutique owner Shauna Stein, as always, put it bluntly: "That's
the last thing I need around my hips."</TE>

<HD>'The Flag Is for Everyone'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: Ashley thinks Sara's family shouldn't be
flying the flag in front of their house. Sara has decided to ask her
teacher about it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marjorie Flathers</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I'M scared," Sara said to Mrs. Vickroy, her sixth-grade teacher. She
walked to the back of the room, where Mrs. Vickroy was pinning fall
leaves to the bulletin board.</LD>
<LD>   "Yesterday," Sara continued, "Ashley told me our country might
fight a war in Iraq, and she said my parents shouldn't be flying the
flag if they don't believe in war."</LD>
<LD>   "That's not true," Mrs. Vickroy answered. "No matter what they
believe, your parents are free to fly the flag."</LD>
<TE>   "That's what they said when I asked them about it last night. My
mom said she's against war because of all the lives that are lost,
and my dad said we should wait and watch instead of just rushing over
to Iraq. But Ashley said they're not loyal Americans. So who's
right?"</TE>
<TE>   "You've brought up some important things, Sara," Mrs. Vickroy
said, "and we need to discuss them together."</TE>
<TE>   She walked to the front of the room and called for attention.</TE>
<TE>   "This morning, class," she said, "we're not going to do our
regular assignments."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah! Yeah!" Shouts filled the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Vickroy put up her hand. "I did not say we weren't going to
work. Instead of our usual studies, we're going to talk about
something that's very important right now."</TE>
<TE>   The students settled down as best they could.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure all of you have heard the people on television speak
about the possibility of a war with Iraq, and I want to hear what you
think."</TE>
<TE>   Ashley raised her hand immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "People who say they are proud Americans should be ready to fight
for their country, no matter what," she said firmly.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a popular opinion," Mrs. Vickroy said. "Does anyone have
a relative or friend who fought in a war?"</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will this discussion help Sara with her question?</TE>

<HD>Presidential victories, blunders on display in Mudd's
'Libraries'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sandell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Political junkies, take heart. While you're watching election
results, you might want to keep an eye (or set the VCR) on the
History Channel's "Presidential Libraries With Roger Mudd." For as
U.S. politicians await their future tonight, Mudd and three former
presidents ponder how legacies -- and maybe, just maybe, the truth --
might be preserved.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight's hourlong show begins at 8 with the libraries' curious
history. Before Franklin D. Roosevelt, the preservation of papers and
other presidential trappings was haphazard and largely far from
public view. But that changed in 1941, when the first library was
built, for the incumbent Roosevelt. Private funds financed the
construction, with the federal government responsible for operating
the site.</LD>
<LD>   Though presidents now typically wait to build until they're out of
office, the funding structure continues to this day for a dozen
facilities nationwide, at an annual cost to taxpayers of $55 million.
Interestingly enough, these libraries have no books in circulation,
nor are their archives open to the general public. But for the more
than 1 million people who visited them in 2001, the libraries do
offer displays of everything from notable papers to clothing to the
obligatory Oval Office re-creation -- and gift shops, as Mudd points
out.</LD>
<TE>   The veteran newsman presides over the program with an evenhanded
approach to the good, the bad and the ugly of how these libraries
present their namesakes' victories and blunders, and he displays deft
interviewing skills with Presidents Carter, Clinton and George H.W.
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Each past president seems to speak candidly, whether it's Carter
saying how awkward it is to raise money, Bush warning visitors not to
get caught up in the "ego trip" or Clinton envisioning how people 100
years from now might view his library, slated to open in 2004 as the
nation's 13th.</TE>
<TE>   For these interviews alone, "Presidential Libraries" is well worth
checking out.</TE>

<HD>Turkey Will Find a Balance Between Secularists and
Islamists</HD>
<DH>Fears of regime crisis and army intervention are unfounded.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Justice and Development Party, or AKP, a party with roots in
Islamist opposition, on Sunday won 363 of the 550 seats in the
Turkish parliament.</LD>
<LD>   Predicting a potential failure of Turkish democracy, some analysts
say the Turkish military will step in to take away this Islamist
victory and preserve Turkey's status as a predominantly Muslim yet
secular country.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing could be less likely. Turkey is a strong democracy; a
victory by a party with an Islamist pedigree will not result in a
regime crisis.</LD>
<TE>   And in any event, although AKP has roots in the Islamist movement,
the party has stopped promoting political Islam, endorsing instead
democracy and secularism. This is an encouraging development for
those of us who believe that democracy and Islam are compatible.</TE>
<TE>   What are the lessons that the larger Muslim world and the West can
gather from the Turkish example?</TE>
<TE>   AKP is an offshoot of the Islamist Welfare Party, or Refah, which
took over in a confrontational coalition government in 1996. When
that party launched Islamist domestic and foreign policy initiatives,
it ran up against the powerful secularist bloc, which includes the
media, courts, civil-society organizations, religious minorities and
many Muslims who want to see a separation of mosque and state.</TE>
<TE>   The secularist reaction, which forced the Islamists to finally
step down from office in 1997, also taught them two valuable lessons:</TE>
<TE>   * The secularists will fight back hard against using democracy to
attack secularism.</TE>
<TE>   * In a democracy, moderation is more appealing than either
extremism or confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   AKP is a product of these facts. Since its inception in 2001, the
party has been aggressively advertising itself as a moderately
conservative party that would not challenge secularism.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, unlike the previous Islamists, AKP has stayed away
from challenging the nonpartisan orientation of Turkish foreign
policy. The party has declared that it will follow Ankara's current
line of "cautious and qualified" support for an American campaign in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it is highly improbable that the army will intervene. Turkey
in 2002 is a strong democracy, unlike in 1960 and 1980, when the army
overthrew the elected governments.</TE>
<TE>   In this regard, just as the Islamists have learned their lessons
in democracy, so have the secularists, who know they must accommodate
the majority moderate Islamists within democracy and demand that the
Islamists weed out the marginal extremists.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Turkish secularists want to see AKP show its
commitment to the separation of mosque and state. That means making a
clean break from the Islamist elements in party leadership,
especially party head Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</TE>
<TE>   An independent Turkish election board decided on Sept. 20 that
Erdogan, a former mayor of Istanbul who had been sentenced to a brief
jail term in 1998 for inciting "religious hatred," could not run for
office in November. So although Erdogan heads the party that won the
most seats, he himself does not have a seat in parliament. Who will
be prime minister?</TE>
<TE>   AKP could insist on Erdogan and potentially polarize the political
system. But that could be its demise: While the Turkish electorate
shies away from confrontation, polarization would hurt AKP by scaring
away the majority moderate voters.</TE>
<TE>   Alternatively, AKP could draw on the lessons of democracy by
replacing Erdogan with a more moderate figure, such as the party vice
chair, Abdullah Gul; the parliamentary whip, Bulent Arinc; or Vecdi
Gonul, the former chief justice of the Court of Accounts and a good
friend of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer. Any of these choices
would underline AKP's commitment to work within the system.</TE>
<TE>   By continuing to avoid injecting Islam into the political sphere,
AKP might enjoy further acceptance from secular democrats. If this
happens, it will have positive ramifications not only for Turkey but
also for all optimists in the global debate about Islam and
democracy.</TE>

<DH>Young people feel left out of the political process.</DH>

<LD>This election, young people again will not vote in very great
numbers. In the 1998 midterm election, only 12% of 18- to
24-year-olds and 8.5% of 18- and 19-year-olds voted. Today will be
about the same.</LD>
<LD>   And yet a recent study funded by Pew Charitable Trusts found that
young people were volunteering in their communities more than ever.
Young people are not apathetic, but most find little connection
between volunteering and voting. While volunteering is viewed as a
way to help one's community, voting doesn't inspire the same
sentiments.</LD>
<LD>   Why don't young people vote? Perhaps because they have a better
sense than older people that our political system is broken. For
instance, a recent survey conducted by Harvard University found that
83.5% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they were not contacted by any
political party during the 2000 election. On the other hand, it is
well documented that both major parties went out of their way to
connect with the 65-and-over population.</LD>
<TE>   Why are candidates going after one group of voters and relegating
others to the political sidelines? One reason is that seniors vote in
greater numbers than young people. Politicians court likely voters,
and that creates a vicious cycle in which young people don't vote
because they aren't courted and they aren't courted because they
don't vote.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a more careful reading reveals something more broken about our
"winner take all" political system. In close electoral contests --
such as our last presidential election, or in a handful of races to
determine control of the U.S. House and Senate -- a small minority of
voters has much greater influence than the rest of us. This is the
group known as "swing voters." Swing voters are undecided voters, and
in close races they are the ones politicians court because swing
voters decide which candidate will win.</TE>
<TE>   It just so happens that not only are seniors more likely to vote
than young people, many of them are more likely to be swing voters
than young people. During the presidential election, the focus was on
Medicare, prescription drugs and Social Security. There were a lot
more issues out there and constituencies that cared about them, yet
they were overlooked. Why? Because in winner-take-all politics, polls
and focus groups are used to figure out which group of voters to talk
to and which group of voters to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   As one twentysomething said during the last presidential campaign:
"I feel like if you are not 65 years old and don't have arthritis,
these candidates have nothing to say you."</TE>
<TE>   Campaigns have become a matter of targeting the right demographic
using polls and focus groups. "Demography," says Mario Velasquez,
president of Rock the Vote, which registers young people to vote, "is
the death of democracy. If you have precision demographics, you are
only talking to people who vote, not to the entire country."</TE>
<TE>   Young people aren't the only ones being left out by precision
demographics. Racial minorities and poor people also usually are
excluded from candidate appeals. The incentives of our
winner-take-all system fragment campaigns, and in the process whole
swaths of people are dropped from the invite list of our "invitation
only" elections. Demographics, it turns out, are destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Change certainly is needed. Other nations have much higher voter
turnout rates because they use what is known as proportional
representation, which creates multiparty democracy: Voters have more
political choice, there are more competitive elections and more
people's issues are addressed by the various parties and their
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Other necessary changes include instant runoff voting, a national
holiday on election day, same-day voter registration and public
financing of elections. Not surprisingly, nations that employ these
practices enjoy much higher rates of voting that include more young
people, poor people and others left out of our political system.</TE>
<TE>   More than older adults, young people seem to recognize that our
political system is broken. They register their awareness on election
day by not bothering to participate in what to them is a meaningless
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   When you see the low numbers for voter turnout this time, don't
think of it as apathy. Think of it as the wisdom of youth.</TE>

<HD>Race for Power Misses a Certain Spark</HD>
<DH>State's electricity crisis was never debated, but it will
remain an issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Navarro</AU>
<BD>Peter Navarro is a business professor at UC Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state's gubernatorial and legislative candidates must have
skipped civic class on the day when the rest of us were taught that
campaigns should be about big issues. How else to explain the silence
in this election on our long-running but unresolved electricity
crisis?</LD>
<LD>   Here are five issues that the candidates should have debated and
the winners will have to address:</LD>
<LD>   * A SoCal bailout: A federal judge has swatted down the backroom
bailout that state regulators cut, which would have allowed Southern
California Edison to use billions of ratepayer dollars to pay off
creditors. If the bailout is ruled illegal by an appeals court, it
will be a big victory for consumer advocates.</LD>
<TE>   However, there is no Plan B to deal with an Edison bankruptcy and
the probable ensuing chaos. A renewed debate over the possibility of
a "buyout" in which the state would receive at least some Edison
assets, rather than a bailout, would have been timely and refreshing.</TE>
<TE>   * A NoCal plot: Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Corp. is asking a
bankruptcy judge to approve a plan that would allow it to slip the
bonds of state regulation and sell its power to the highest bidder
anywhere in the West. That's a recipe for price gouging and power
shortages, but where was the candidate outrage? PG&amp;E also wants to
sell off its hydroelectric assets. Environmentalists fear that some
pristine land could fall into the hands of mining and development
interests, but where was the debate?</TE>
<TE>   * Shams are us: Literally, in the crisis' darkest hour, Gov. Gray
Davis signed $40 billion worth of overpriced long-term contracts,
saddling California with the highest rates in the country for years.
Now, the governor has ample evidence of rampant market manipulation
-- grounds to break the contracts. Instead, he engages in sham
renegotiations that trumpet "billions" in savings.</TE>
<TE>   The fine print reveals the alleged savings are at the very back
ends of the contracts, ensuring that we will continue to pay through
the nose for years.</TE>
<TE>   Among Bill Simon's many missed issue opportunities, this was
perhaps his biggest.</TE>
<TE>   * Blackouts redux: For the next few years, newly commissioned
plants will give us a glut of power. The Enron scandal and ensuing
collapse of the energy market, however, have led to severe cash flow
problems at many of the companies building the state's long-term
supply. Many generators -- most notably Calpine -- have drastically
cut back construction. We face a possible replay of rolling blackouts
within three to five years. It takes that long to plan and build new
power plants. Shouldn't the candidates have debated this issue?</TE>
<TE>   * Fully deregulate or tightly re-regulate: California's
electricity market is neither deregulated fish nor tightly regulated
fowl but rather a rogue camel designed by hapless committee. At some
point, our politicians must decide whether to embark on the full
deregulation that was never really implemented or return to the
strict, old-style rate regulation of new plants.</TE>
<TE>   Now, we are in the worst of both worlds. With no real deregulated
market in place, we can't benefit from falling energy prices. With
the unresolved specter of a regulatory crackdown, generators are
finding it increasingly risky to put new plants in the state, raising
fears about inadequacy of long-term supply. The only thing more
remarkable about this situation is the failure of the 2002
gubernatorial and legislative campaigns to offer any constructive
solutions.</TE>

<HD>Playing Population-Explosion Politics</HD>
<DH>Bush panders to right by pulling back from a key accord,
imperiling us all.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To placate its powerful allies on the extreme right, the Bush
administration is once again playing political games with the fate of
our planet.</LD>
<LD>   The latest watershed global agreement the White House is
sabotaging is a bold international accord the U.S. helped write that
offers real hope for stabilizing the world's exploding population.</LD>
<LD>   In 200 years, the world's population has grown sixfold; it could
almost double again by 2050. Every second, two people die and five
are born. And while population growth has always been a controversial
issue, it is now clear that we have begun to severely strain the
Earth's finite resources.</LD>
<TE>   Chaos is the increasingly real result of trying to support more
than 6 billion people on this planet, spawning desperate mass
migrations, wars over rights to fresh water, medical epidemics,
bloody riots and crime waves nurtured in teeming shantytowns.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terrorism, too, cannot logically be divorced from the
struggle for population sanity. Refugee camps and hopeless slums
steadily churn out alienated, landless young men and women who are
perfect cannon fodder for ambitious religious and political zealots.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1994 United Nations population conference in Cairo, nations
with different religious, social and political make-ups bravely
acknowledged that the only proven way to slow the pace of the
population explosion was to empower women by giving them reproductive
rights, basic education and adequate health care so that they are
capable of choosing a family size that offers them the best chance at
being economically successful.</TE>
<TE>   This was a revolutionary idea because for much of human history a
large brood of children, particularly boys, was valued as a source of
farm labor; the value of women was based on their reproductive
capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Modern sanitation and medical practices, however, have changed
human death rates in the last two centuries, especially in terms of
infant mortality, but rural cultures, fundamentalist religions and
nationalist politicians have been slow to adapt to the reality that
more is no longer always better.</TE>
<TE>   It was such reactionary forces, led by a trio of odd bedfellows --
the U.S. religious right, several repressive Muslim regimes and the
Vatican -- that have worked to put the kibosh on the final
declaration of the U.N. conference, a carefully crafted pact
supported by 179 nations. Now they have found their knight in shining
armor in President Bush, who apparently wanted to shore up his right
flank for the midterm elections and whose administration is now
threatening to withdraw crucial U.S. support for the agreement based
on some of its language.</TE>
<TE>   One of the White House's beefs, for example, is with a line that
says that in societies where abortion is legal, health care should be
provided to make the procedure safe. According to the National Right
to Life Committee, which heartily praised Bush's stance, statements
like the one in the agreement are "code" advocating abortions.</TE>
<TE>   But given that abortions are legal in the United States and are
required to be medically sound, why would an American president seek
to deny that standard of health-care protection to the rest of the
world?</TE>
<TE>   Here's why: Women in other countries can't vote in U.S. elections,
but the members of the National Right to Life Committee not only vote
but also donate to candidates and political action committees.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other in recent memory, this administration is
marked by a foreign policy driven primarily by a domestic agenda.</TE>
<TE>   To seek the votes of the right-to-life caucus by mucking about
with the excruciatingly complex and difficult task of reining in
world population is as dangerous in its effect as it is tawdry in its
motive.</TE>
<TE>   And, once again, our arrogant unilateralism will cost us
strategically as well as morally. When overpopulated China, India and
Indonesia, as well as nations in Europe dealing with myriad crises
arising from immigration, all react bitterly to this latest American
isolationism, can we be surprised that they are hesitant to support
Bush's jihad against Iraq?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this won't bother the aggressive claque of right-wing
think-tankers currently running the foreign policy of the most
powerful nation in the existence of humanity, who seem to think that
power makes us God.</TE>
<TE>   We are not God, and our power must not be abused. At a time when
the gap between the rich and the poor is dangerously increasing, when
vast armies of the desperately poor are crashing through national
boundaries, it is irresponsible in the extreme to sacrifice world
population stability on the altar of domestic political advantage.</TE>

<HD>Spare Schizophrenic's Life</HD>

<LD>James Colburn was raped at 17 by a man who picked him up when he was
hitchhiking. He began suffering delusions. He told his mother he saw
a devil slither out of his stomach. Voices told him to kill himself
or his family.</LD>
<LD>   A psychiatrist diagnosed chronic paranoid schizophrenia and
Colburn's relatives tried to commit him for long-term treatment. They
failed; public officials said he wasn't an immediate danger to
himself or others. Now 42, Colburn is on death row in Texas,
imprisoned for the 1994 murder of 55-year-old Peggy Murphy. He is to
be killed by lethal injection Wednesday. His lawyers have asked the
U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution. It should do that.</LD>
<LD>   Though the court in June banned the execution of the mentally
retarded, it has yet to rule on whether the seriously mentally ill
should also be spared. Some high court judges worry, with good
reason, that lawyers and psychiatrists could wield dubious
"disorders" in attempts to absolve virtually anyone of
responsibility. Indeed, common sense suggests that the shakiest of
lines distinguish insane murderers from the purely rational variety.</LD>
<TE>   Texas, on the other hand, would be unequivocally coldblooded to
execute Colburn for two simple reasons:</TE>
<TE>   * His trial was unfair. The U.S. Constitution requires that
defendants be physically and mentally competent to understand the
charges against them. Colburn was given such high doses of a sedating
antipsychotic that he slept through large parts of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   * Executing him would be perverse. Society let Colburn live for
years with severe mental illness. Now the state will finally address
his illness, thoroughly medicating him to assure that he has a full
grasp of what's happening when he is executed.</TE>
<TE>   One of Colburn's jurors, Kimberly Queener, says she would not have
voted for death had the jury been told just two facts: that
schizophrenia and medications can cause a bland facial expression
(something jurors had interpreted as a lack of remorse) and that the
jury could have called for a sentence that would have kept the killer
forever away from any future victims.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to blame Texas for feeling unmerciful toward a killer.
But Colburn's case is exceptional. The Supreme Court should
intervene. And people should grasp that allowing someone to suffer
overwhelming mental illness is a prescription for tragedy.</TE>

<LD>You probably have not quite yet booked vacation travel for July 27 to
Aug. 12, 2012. But the process for reserving a Summer Olympics site
at that time is well underway. The International Olympic Committee
won't pick the city for two years. But the U.S. Olympic Committee
last weekend made New York America's 2012 nominee.</LD>
<LD>   A lot can happen in 10 years: By then, the United Nations might
actually have an Iraq resolution, Caltrans could do five more
two-year studies of Hollywood Freeway improvements, and Gray Davis
should be about done with fund-raising for his 2002 reelection
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, New York's win at one end of Interstate 80 destroyed the Bay
Area's hopes at the other, plus any chance of a fourth California
Olympics soon. From a few Greeks wrestling in loincloths, the
Olympics have become huge business -- thanks to TV -- both in terms
of money and public relations. New Yorkers estimate preparatory
Olympic spending at $5.4 billion, including a new West Side stadium
and subway line, a pittance compared with Beijing's $30-billion
budget for 2008. But it'll create momentum behind controversial
infrastructure improvements.</LD>
<TE>   New York's strength, as when the city was picked for the United
Nations' headquarters more than five decades ago, is its immigrant
diversity plus financial and political clout, now flavored by
renowned resilience from the 9/11 attacks. The United States'
advantage -- and problem -- as the lone superpower is that it is
always more important to other countries than they are individually
to it. This creates leverage and resentments.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the IOC's top 10 financial backers are U.S. corporations,
as is the TV rights owner, NBC. If Vancouver gets the 2010 Winter
Olympics nod next summer, that could give the Eurocentric IOC an
excuse to choose another location for 2012 -- Moscow, Madrid,
Budapest, Paris or even Rio de Janeiro.</TE>
<TE>   A united New York could perhaps stage as profitable a Games as Los
Angeles' in 1984 and Salt Lake City's this year, producing vital
funds for amateur American athletics. And if you get in the cab line
at LaGuardia Airport anytime this month, you might just make the
opening ceremonies in 2012.</TE>

<HD>BP Won't Replace L.A.'s Top Executive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The downtown Los Angeles regional headquarters of BP, which owns the
Arco and Thrifty chains in California, is losing its top executive
and he will not be replaced, a company spokesman said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   When Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co. was acquired in 2000
by BP Amoco, as the London-based oil giant was then known, the new
owner pledged to maintain a trimmed-down regional headquarters in
downtown Los Angeles headed by a regional president running Western
U.S. operations.</LD>
<LD>   Now, that top regional executive, Robert A. Malone, is being
promoted to a London-based job running the shipping operation of BP,
the world's second-largest publicly traded oil company, said BP
spokesman Paul Langland.</LD>
<TE>   Malone's duties will be taken over by Ross Pillari, a
Chicago-based executive who was BP's other regional president in the
United States. Pillari will remain in Chicago and will take the title
of president of BP America.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Western headquarters in downtown Los Angeles is
losing its titular head, the 90-person office will remain -- at least
for the time being -- to handle public relations, governmental
affairs, legal work and other functions, Langland said. However, last
week BP announced worse-than-expected earnings and is believed to be
readying extensive cost cuts, including layoffs around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at all of our offices across the United States
because of another reorganization," Langland said. "No decision has
been made."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, BP is shifting responsibility for most of its retail
service stations to its La Palma office, Langland said. Previously,
the retail business was run by four regional offices around the
country, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, BP is sticking to its commitment to make $100 million
in charitable contributions in California, Langland said. BP made
that promise during the takeover of Arco, a major corporate donor.
More than 2,500 Arco employees lost their jobs in the acquisition.</TE>

<HD>SEC Lawsuit Against Adelphia Put on Hold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/ Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against Adelphia
Communications Corp. and members of the Rigas family has been put on
hold while criminal proceedings against the family members and two
other former company executives move forward.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Kimba M. Wood of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan
granted a request by James Comey, U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York, to intervene and hold off on discovery in the
suit, according to court papers.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit accuses the cable company and its former executives of
concealing more than $2.3 billion of bank debt by shifting it off the
books.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit was delayed to avoid prejudicing similar criminal
proceedings against company founder John Rigas, his sons Timothy and
Michael and former company executives James Brown and Michael
Mulcahey, a letter from Comey's office said.</TE>
<TE>   The five former executives have pleaded not guilty to criminal
charges of securities, wire and bank fraud in connection with an
accounting scandal that drove the cable company to file for
bankruptcy protection in late June.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal broke in March, after Adelphia announced that it
failed to disclose that it had guaranteed more than $2 billion in
loans for members of the Rigas family or entities they controlled.</TE>
<TE>   The Rigases resigned from their positions in late May.</TE>
<TE>   Discovery in the SEC's lawsuit will be stayed pending resolution
of the criminal case and any other related prosecutions, the related
grand jury investigation or until Wood orders otherwise, according to
court papers.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Adelphia declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Applied to Cut 1,750 Jobs</HD>
<DH>The chip-equipment maker cites the continuing downturn in
the semiconductor industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chip-equipment maker Applied Materials Inc. on Monday announced that
it will eliminate 1,750 jobs, or 11% of its work force, to cope with
a slump in the market for computers and other high-tech devices.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Applied, the world's largest
manufacturer of machines used to make semiconductors, said the job
cuts will include 800 workers from its Silicon Valley operations and
200 from its Austin, Texas, facility. It also will take an
unspecified charge in its first quarter ending Jan. 26 to account for
the layoffs. It currently has 16,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   "In the past, when they've hit hard times, they've lowered
salaries 5% to 15%," said Alex Mou, senior analyst with San Francisco
research firm Hotovec, Pomeranz &amp; Co. "The layoff sends the signal
that a quick rebound is not in sight. We expect the sector to
continue to have a challenging time in 2003."</LD>
<TE>   Many chip companies that are customers of Applied, including chip
giant Intel Corp., have forecast anemic sales growth for the
remainder of the year and modest growth in 2003, based on weak
consumer and business spending.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, chip makers have cut back spending. Intel, for
instance, reduced capital expenditures from $7.3 billion in 2001 to
an estimated $4.7 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the semiconductor market picks up in 2003, analysts say
Applied and other equipment makers will be slow to recover. The
reason: Chip companies overbuilt their production capacity in 1999
and 2000, and it will take some time for chip demand to catch up, Mou
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares rose 73 cents to $16.45 on Nasdaq, then fell to $16 in
after-hours trading after the announcement.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong to Create Trust for Asbestos Cases</HD>
<DH>Firm follows example of Johns Manville in establishing
structure to handle liability claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armstrong World Industries  Inc. said Monday that it would create a
billion-dollar trust to resolve thousands of asbestos-related
lawsuits as part of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The flooring maker said it would fund the trust with cash and
securities to settle claims by individuals who say asbestos in the
company's products made them ill. In creating the trust, Armstrong
follows the example of Johns Manville Corp., a building-products
maker that in 1982 filed for Chapter 11 protection.</LD>
<LD>   Manville's trust, the first created to handle asbestos claims, has
paid exposed workers about $2.7 billion. The settlement later became
part of U.S. bankruptcy law, allowing companies to establish trusts
to settle asbestos suits. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
now owns Manville.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to see a lot of these trusts being set up in the next
few years," said Charles Tatelbaum, a bankruptcy lawyer who has
handled asbestos-related cases. "It's the only sure-fire way a
company can get free of future asbestos liability."</TE>
<TE>   Jury awards and settlements in asbestos cases have driven more
than a dozen public companies into bankruptcy since February 2000,
including Owens Corning, the largest U.S. insulation maker.
Consulting firm Towers Perrin estimated this year that asbestos suits
may cost U.S. companies $200 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong filed for Chapter 11 protection in December 2000 after
the Lancaster, Pa.-based company reported to the Securities and
Exchange Commission that it couldn't cope with an onslaught of
asbestos suits and might face more than $1.35 billion in asbestos
claims by 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "Armstrong entered into Chapter 11 to use the court-supervised
process to resolve its liability for asbestos personal- injury
claims," Armstrong Chairman and Chief Executive Michael E. Lockhart
said. "We believe that the plan we have filed will accomplish that
objective."</TE>
<TE>   Publicly held Armstrong Holdings Inc. became the parent of
Armstrong World Industries Inc. in May 2000. The holding company was
established to exchange each share of Armstrong World Industries for
one share of Armstrong Holdings. Armstrong Holdings owns no

<HD>NBC to Add New Content to Bravo</HD>
<DH>Unlike some rivals, the network will develop shows for the
cable channel it agreed to buy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You won't see the peacock being recycled on Bravo.</LD>
<LD>   NBC Chief Executive Bob Wright said his network will focus on
developing new shows for the upscale cable channel it agreed to
purchase Monday, rather than using it to air repeats, as some of its
broadcast rivals do with their in-house cable channels. That helps
them absorb the costs of their prime-time schedules.</LD>
<LD>   Although Walt Disney Co. paid $5.2 billion last year to turn what
is now known as the ABC Family Channel into a secondary outlet for
shows on its ABC broadcast network, Wright said such "repurposing is
not an objective" for General Electric Co.-owned NBC, which paid
$1.25 billion in cash and stock to purchase Bravo from Cablevision
Systems Corp. and its minority partner, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. The
deal was expected.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Wright said he does see opportunities for Bravo to share
the collective resources of NBC to strengthen the channel -- and
therefore its ratings and advertising revenue.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Bravo could use footage from NBC News, CNBC and
MSNBC to develop new programs as well as for its nonfiction signature
shows, "Bravo Profile" and "Inside the Actor's Studio."</TE>
<TE>   Projects pitched by writers, directors and producers not suitable
for NBC, Wright said, also could make their way onto the cable
channel. Bravo programs could even feed NBC, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said Bravo will maintain its arts and culture orientation.
"We'll continue it in the vein it is today," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   Changes, however, are on the way.</TE>
<TE>   Bravo will be overseen by Jeff Zucker, president of NBC
Entertainment, now in charge of the networks' prime-time schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker said NBC would look for ways to develop scripted dramas and
comedies. For instance, the network is producing two versions of a
drama for next year called "Kingpin," about drug trafficking. The
more graphic, uncut version could be televised on Bravo.</TE>
<TE>   "Bravo has a strong identity with an upscale target similar to
NBC's," Zucker said. "That's something we want to hone."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Zucker said NBC events such as the Golden Globe
Awards and Emmy Awards could be extended on Bravo just as NBC has
expanded Olympic coverage using the company's CNBC and MSNBC cable
news channels.</TE>
<TE>   Wright said some NBC programs could end up airing on Bravo, but
not to the extent that ABC uses its cable channel. Bravo previously
struck a deal to air reruns of NBC's hit drama "The West Wing."</TE>

<HD>State Ranked Sixth in Productivity in 2000, Report Shows</HD>
<DH>A Fed economist cites a skilled work force and firms'
efficient use of space and equipment among reasons for California's
high output.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California has been maligned as one of the most high-cost, heavily
regulated, business-unfriendly places in the U.S. So how does it keep
on generating wealth that's the envy of much of the rest of the
nation? One answer is productivity.</LD>
<LD>   That's the finding of research released Monday by the Federal
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which has determined that California
ranked sixth in the nation in the productivity of its workers in
2000. They produced just over $79,000 in goods and services per
worker, trailing only Alaska, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and
Washington, D.C. (The figure represents inflation-adjusted 1996
dollars, which the Fed used as a baseline for a historical
comparison.)</LD>
<LD>   Labor productivity, which measures the real output of goods and
services per hour of work, is the primary determinant of a region's
long-run standard of living. It's the main factor that drives wage
growth. It also helps businesses cut costs and boost profitability.</LD>
<TE>   California's productivity performance is remarkable, according to
Federal Reserve economist Daniel Wilson, because of the state's sheer
size and because its productivity advantage has persisted over a
number of years.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska led all states in labor productivity in 2000, with nearly
$90,000 worth of output per worker, largely because it has huge oil
and natural gas industries that generate a lot of product with a
relatively small number of workers. California, by contrast,
displayed higher productivity than the national average across a wide
variety of industries. And it has been doing so since at least the
mid-1980s.</TE>
<TE>   So why is California's productivity so high?</TE>
<TE>   Wilson points to various factors, starting with the high amount of
capital per worker. Land and other costs are so high in California
that companies tend to concentrate value-added activities and
labor-saving technology here to get the most bang for their buck.</TE>
<TE>   "If you put a warehouse in California, you're going to give it
better equipment than you would elsewhere to make the most of that
acre of land," Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   Workplace practices and organizational structure have likewise
allowed California businesses to gain efficiencies, he said. Silicon
Valley, for instance, has fostered a highly mobile work force that
has led to the rapid spread of innovation and knowledge to other
firms as employees move around.</TE>
<TE>   California's ability to attract a highly skilled labor force also
has boosted its productivity. In 2000, compensation per worker was
about $52,000 in California, compared with an average of about
$44,000 for the rest of the U.S., reflecting in part the higher
productivity of its work force, according to Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   He said California's productivity advantage going forward would
hinge largely on its ability to keep attracting the brightest workers
from other states or abroad, as well as on educating the state's
low-skill immigrants and their children.</TE>

<HD>Factory Orders Fall; Announced Layoffs Up</HD>
<DH>Reports reinforce belief that the Federal Reserve will cut
interest rates by at least a quarter point Wednesday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. factory orders plunged in September and layoff announcements by
American firms surged in October, according to reports Monday that
reinforced belief the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.</LD>
<LD>   The value of new orders to factories tumbled 2.3% in September to
$318.1 billion, after a 0.4% decrease in August, the Commerce
Department said.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate report, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp;
Christmas Inc. said job cuts announced by U.S. firms rocketed to
176,010 in October, a rate of more than 7,600 per business day.</LD>
<TE>   The October figure marked the second-largest number of announced
layoffs this year, fewer only than January's, and compared with
70,057 announcements in September.</TE>
<TE>   "The Challenger report underscores that businesses are continuing
their efforts to cut costs," said Christopher Wiegand, economist at
Salomon Smith Barney in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The central bank's policy arm, the Federal Open Market Committee,
meets Wednesday to consider a possible change in interest rates. A
large majority of economists expect a cut in borrowing costs at that
meeting, with most analysts wagering on a quarter-point reduction.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the September orders number was grim, the 2.3% drop
was not as steep as the 3% decline projected by economists.</TE>
<TE>   The declines also were concentrated in two well-known trouble
spots -- airlines and communications -- and some categories such as
nondurable goods showed improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Orders for nondurable items, such as clothing, paper and
chemicals, edged up 0.9%.</TE>
<TE>   The key durable-goods component of the report showed a 4.9% drop
in September, compared with the 5.9% nosedive the Commerce Department
originally had reported.</TE>
<TE>   Also, total factory orders excluding the volatile transportation
sector actually rose by 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation orders plummeted 15.9%, due to a 46.3% drop in
orders for civilian aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The total factory inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.33 in
September from 1.32 in August, signaling a higher backlog of goods
that may leave less incentive for factories to ramp up production.</TE>

<HD>Ford Says It Is Recalling 573,000 Focus Cars</HD>
<DH>Potential problems in '00 and '01 vehicles include a loose
bolt and engine fires.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ford Motor Co. said Monday that it was recalling about 573,000 of its
compact Focus vehicles in North America from the 2000 and 2001 model
years because of potential safety problems such as engine fires.</LD>
<LD>   The Focus has suffered quality problems since its introduction in
1999. Ford, which is implementing a wrenching turnaround plan after
losing $5.45 billion last year, now has issued 11 safety recalls for
the vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   The world's No. 2 automaker said the latest recalls stemmed from
two separate issues that could have safety consequences.</LD>
<TE>   One involves a bolt in the front suspension assembly that can
become loose and cause noise and vibration or, in a small number of
cases, lead to a separation of the ball joint.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said the other concern involved Focus vehicles with Zetec
engines in which potential problems with the placement of a battery
cable could result in smoke, wire melting or under-hood fires.</TE>
<TE>   A company spokesman said there had been no reports of injuries
stemming from either of the potential defects in the recalled
vehicles, but two accidents are alleged to have been caused by loose
or missing front suspension bolts.</TE>
<TE>   Ford also said it was extending a service program on 2000 and 2001
Focus vehicles in North America because of concerns about a
rear-wheel bearing seal.</TE>
<TE>   An earlier service program involved vehicle owners in 21 U.S.
states. But Ford said North American customers outside those original
areas, including owners in Canada, now would be encouraged to bring
their cars to dealerships to have the seal replaced.</TE>
<TE>   Ford shares, which are trading well off a 52-week high of $19.08,
closed up 13 cents at $8.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar Patent Claims Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wires Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cable television set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta Inc. on Monday
said a Georgia federal court has thrown out some patent infringement
claims against it made by Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta-based Scientific-Atlanta said the court ruled that the
firm's Explorer 3000 and 8600x set-top boxes do not infringe two
patents held by Gemstar, which makes interactive
television-programming guides.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling is yet another victory in the company's legal war with
Gemstar over patented innovations. The same court previously threw
out claims made by Gemstar on the same two patents against
Scientific-Atlanta's Explorer 2000 boxes.</LD>
<TE>   Scientific-Atlanta said other patents remain under contention in
the same Georgia suit.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific-Atlanta shares gained 78 cents, or 6%, to close at
$13.97 on the New York Stock Exchange, and Gemstar shares rose 11
cents to $3.74.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar shares have fallen 87% in the last year as it
unsuccessfully sued to enforce its patents against makers of set-top
boxes including Scientific-Atlanta, Pioneer Corp. and Sanmina-SCI
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Gemstar had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena-based Gemstar, which is under formal investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week it would restate 2
1/2 years of financial results, including removing $113 million it
booked as revenue in anticipation of winning the dispute with
Scientific-Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar Chief Executive Henry Yuen was replaced last month after
an accounting review by the board's audit committee, and last week
the company fired its accounting firm, KPMG. Jeff Shell, a former
executive of Gemstar's largest shareholder, News Corp., took over the
reins.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar holds more than 190 patents for the software used to run
menus that help TV viewers pick shows.</TE>

<HD>Dow Up Again; Tech Stocks Rally</HD>
<DH>Microsoft settlement gives a boost to its rivals, but blue
chips give back much of their gains in advance of today's elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp.'s antitrust settlement stoked a strong rally in
technology shares Monday, but blue chips gave up much of their
advance by the close as investors pulled back ahead of the elections.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow industrials, which include Microsoft, rose as much as 213
points by midday, then sold off in the final hour, closing with a
gain of 53.96 points, or 0.6%, at 8,571.60.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite, which also includes Microsoft, gained 35.84
points, or 2.6%, to 1,396.54. It had been up as much as 4.4%.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft rallied $3.10 to $56.10, a gain of nearly 6%, on the
heels of a judge's decision Friday approving an antitrust settlement
that was largely in the software giant's favor.</TE>
<TE>   The tech sector in general rallied as some investors apparently
viewed the settlement as the lifting of a cloud over the sector. Even
most of Microsoft's archrivals gained ground.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle, for example, rose 11 cents to $10.24, while AOL Time
Warner added 38 cents to $15.53.</TE>
<TE>   "Tech got way overdone on the downside" with the lows many of the
stocks reached in mid-October, said Scott Bleier, president of
Hybridinvestors.com, a research advisory service, explaining the
continuing gains in the sector in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   But profit taking hit in the final hour Monday. Some analysts
attributed the selling to caution in advance of today's elections,
with control of Congress hanging in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   Still, more stocks rose than fell. Winners topped losers by 19 to
13 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 21 to 12 on Nasdaq in active
trading.</TE>
<TE>   The market has scored four straight weeks of gains, raising hopes
that the long bear market has run its course.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts have credited part of the latest advance to expectations
that the Federal Reserve would cut its key short-term interest rate
when policymakers meet Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed is expected to trim its rate from 1.75% to 1.5% to help
the economy regain momentum. Reports in recent weeks have suggested
that consumer spending has slowed.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipation of a rate cut perhaps soothed investors after news
Monday from the Commerce Department that factory orders fell 2.3% in
September.</TE>
<TE>   In the bond market, Treasury yields rose modestly after falling
sharply last week. Traders said some investors are jittery ahead of
the government's sale this week of $40 billion in long-term bonds.
The bonds will help finance the federal budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-year T-note yield rose to 4.04%, from 4% on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Although a Fed rate cut could keep downward pressure on bond
yields, "People are starting to come out of low-yielding Treasuries
and into stocks on the expectation the economy will improve," Bob
Ried, an economist at Ried Thunberg &amp; Co., a Westport, Conn.-based
research firm, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a growing feeling that the stock bear market may be
ending. That's negative for Treasuries" in the longer run, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among Monday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * In the tech sector, IBM rose $2.10 to $82.50, while Cisco
Systems climbed 70 cents to $12.31.</TE>
<TE>   * Among battered airlines, UAL surged 62 cents to $3.18 after the
parent of United Airlines reached a tentative $2.2-billion
cost-cutting deal with pilots, lessening chances it would seek
bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   * Retail stocks were mixed. Kohl's fell $3.01 to $57.99 after
Prudential Securities cut its rating to "hold" from "buy."</TE>
<TE>   * Defense stocks tumbled as some investors took profits in that
sector and bought other stocks, analysts said. Lockheed Martin
slumped $6.15 to $50.23 and Northrop Grumman dropped $6.75 to $94.02.</TE>

<HD>Shares of May Fall on Profit Warning</HD>
<DH>The department store company says sluggish sales will push
earnings to less than forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of May Department Stores Co. fell as much as 6% on Monday
after the company warned that sluggish sales would push quarterly
profit below most Wall Street forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   The warning, one week after J.C. Penney Co. raised its earnings
forecast on strong sales, highlighted the widening gap between
department stores and lower-priced retailers as a slumping economy
keeps consumers frugal.</LD>
<LD>   St. Louis-based May, parent of the Lord &amp; Taylor, Robinsons-May
and Filene's chains, said it expects to post a profit of 8 cents to
10 cents a share, excluding charges for division combinations and
early debt redemptions, for its fiscal third quarter ended Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts' estimates ranged from 10 cents to 21 cents a share, with
an average of 17 cents, according to research firm Thomson First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed down 55 cents at $22.89 on the New York Stock
Exchange after falling as low as $22.12 during the session. The stock
underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's retailing index, which was down
0.7%.</TE>
<TE>   A slowdown in consumer spending has hit higher-end department
stores especially hard as a sputtering U.S. economy draws shoppers to
discounters.</TE>
<TE>   "In times like this, anything that has a little bit more of a
value orientation to it is going to be a gainer -- Wal-Mart, Target,
Costco, some of the off-priced retailers," said Nancy Aversa, a
Victory Capital Management analyst whose firm holds May shares among
its roughly $70 billion under management.</TE>
<TE>   Many retailers have reported a drop in traffic at malls, another
blow to Lord &amp; Taylor and other department stores that anchor those
shopping centers.</TE>
<TE>   May said October sales at stores open at least one year fell 7% in
the four weeks ended Saturday, the sixth consecutive monthly decline.</TE>
<TE>   May's third-quarter sales, which include October's results, fell
4% to $3.05 billion from $3.18 billion in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is still just a difficult economy and a challenging
retail environment," May spokeswoman Sharon Bateman said when asked
why sales were weak. "Our sales continue to be soft across the
country."</TE>

<HD>Microsoft Stock Surges in Wake of Ruling</HD>
<DH>Software giant's shares rise as much as 8%, fueling tech
rally, after favorable court decision in antitrust case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Microsoft Corp. surged as much as 8% Monday and led a rally
throughout the tech industry in the first trading day after the
software giant won court approval of a deal settling the government's
four-year antitrust case against it.</LD>
<LD>   The company also won a key ruling Monday in a federal lawsuit
filed by Netscape Communications Corp., maker of the Navigator
Internet browser.</LD>
<LD>   Not all of Monday's tech rally was attributable to Microsoft,
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest
rates when policymakers gather Wednesday also helped the market.</TE>
<TE>   "Microsoft was the afterburner," said analyst Robert Austrian at
Banc of America Securities in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts also noted that the rally faded toward the end of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, a federal judge in Washington upheld a settlement
that Microsoft had reached with the Justice Department and several
states in a case in which the company was found to be illegally
maintaining a monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   In upholding the agreement, the judge rejected a bid by nine
states and the District of Columbia to broaden antitrust sanctions
significantly, restrictions that Chairman Bill Gates had contended
would have forced Microsoft to stop work on some core products such
as the Windows operating system.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, people got a sense that the judge wasn't going
to make radical changes in the settlement," said analyst Brad Reback
of CIBC World Markets in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft's rally actually began late Friday when news spread that
the court had posted its opinion on a Web site 90 minutes before the
close of trading. During that time, the stock rose from $52.22 to
$53, with $90 million worth of stock changing hands in the final five
minutes, Associated Press reported.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Microsoft stock rose as high as $57.40 before settling
back to close at $56.10, up $3.10, or nearly 6%, on Nasdaq. The stock
still is down 15% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Gates, who owns nearly 627 million shares, saw his wealth jump by
$1.9 billion Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Even many Microsoft competitors saw their stocks rise. One major
competitor, Sun Microsystems Inc., slipped, losing 8 cents to close
at $3.20 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Though the federal settlement has been upheld, Microsoft is still
fighting price-fixing and restraint-of-trade claims filed by
consumers and competitors across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a federal judge in Baltimore denied Netscape's request
to hold Microsoft liable for damaging its browser business on the
strength of the findings in the government's case.</TE>
<TE>   "It cannot be fairly said that the facts found in the government
case are sufficient to establish Microsoft's liability to Netscape,"
U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz wrote.</TE>
<TE>   He said the government's case didn't produce evidence of specific
harm to Netscape or other competitors, and that Netscape still must
prove at trial that Microsoft's illegal conduct hurt its business.</TE>
<TE>   Motz, however, did adopt findings in the government's case that
Microsoft sought to exclude Netscape from the market.</TE>

<HD>At the End of the Line, a New Beginning for Historic Site</HD>
<DH>A $20-million makeover will turn downtown L.A.'s Pacific
Electric Building, terminus for the old trolley line, into
apartments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Roger Vincent</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The lights are going on again at the Pacific Electric Building in Los
Angeles, the former home of Henry E. Huntington's storied trolley
line that served Southern California for more than half a century
with its signature red cars made of wood and steel.</LD>
<LD>   The massive brick building at 6th and Main streets has been mostly
dark since 1989, when its former owner, Southern Pacific
Transportation Co., moved out. Beverly Hills-based developer ICO
Investment Group has embarked on an estimated $20-million renovation
to create 314 apartments out of offices that evoke a film-noir vision
of another era, with their mosaic-tiled hallways, glass doors and
transoms.</LD>
<LD>   The makeover, which will take about a year, comes at a time when
several other developers are rushing to turn old Los Angeles office
buildings into lofts. More than 1,000 units are under construction
downtown, and most of them are in historic buildings, according to
the Downtown Center Business Improvement District. An additional
5,800 units are proposed or in various stages of planning.</LD>
<TE>   Skeptics in the real estate industry question whether there will
be enough tenants to fill that many units in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   But a developer of three completed historic office renovations
said more residents would make downtown more desirable -- and
profitable for landlords and shopkeepers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really looking forward to the critical mass these guys
bring," said Tom Gilmore of Gilmore Associates, who rents lofts in
the San Fernando, Continental and Hellman buildings. "Occasionally
people wonder how deep this market is. They don't realize that every
person you bring down here generates two more people six months
later," thanks to word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   The belief that a housing boom is underway is behind ICO's
decision to redevelop its building after holding it for more than a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that the time is right for downtown Los Angeles to be a
24-hour city," said ICO President Alexander Moradi, whose family
bought the property from Southern Pacific in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, the neighborhood was widely considered part of
skid row, an image the historic district has been struggling to
shake. Tenants of nearby buildings complain of drug dealing on their
sidewalks and vagrants who use the streets and alleys as restrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "We need assistance with the homeless," said developer Jeremy
Davey, who is renovating the 92-year-old Higgins Building at 2nd and
Main streets. "It's going to make residency for the near term an
interesting challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Built well before the invention of air conditioning and reliable
artificial lighting, the Pacific Electric is just the kind of old
building developers like to convert. The floors are small compared
with the wide, boxy high-rises that sprung up after World War II.
Windows are wide and tall, affording plenty of natural light. It has
a rooftop terrace suitable for a garden and substantial space for
parking in the former streetcar terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Monthly rents at the Pacific Electric will start at about $1.50 a
foot. That's par for downtown's luxury apartment market, where rents
average $1,600 a month for a two-bedroom unit. That's a little more
than in Burbank and about the same as Hermosa and Redondo beaches,
according to Marcus &amp; Millichap, an apartment broker.</TE>
<TE>   To help address security issues, Pacific Electric apartments will
have a doorman and 24-hour security, Moradi said.</TE>
<TE>   When it opened in 1905, the nine-story building towered over the
mostly residential neighborhood south of the city's business
district.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 500,000 square feet spread over an entire block, it
was the largest building in Los Angeles. Huntington, a real estate
developer, bought and expanded a railway as part of his strategy to
promote the sale and development of large tracts of land in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Building, as it was then known, was his
headquarters and terminus of the electric trolley line that once had
more than 1,000 miles of track.</TE>
<TE>   He rented out most of the office space and turned the top two
floors into new quarters for the Jonathan Club, an exclusive men's
social club formed in 1895 for Republican supporters of William
McKinley.</TE>
<TE>   Club facilities included a top-floor ballroom, theater, billiard
room, card room, gymnasium, tap room, dining hall, breakfast room,
smoking room, library and conversation room. Huntington, the club's
president, maintained a private suite.</TE>
<TE>   In 1910, Huntington sold his train line to Southern Pacific
Railroad, which also took over the building. Ridership declined
steadily starting in the 1930s, and the last car left the Main Street
terminal in 1950. The trolley line operated from another downtown
terminal until 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The Moradi family, which operates ICO, has rented the property to
several movie producers through the years. It has appeared in such
films as "Traffic," "Spider-Man" and "L.A. Confidential," Moradi
said.</TE>
<TE>   A few retailers have continued to operate at street level,
including Cole's P.E. Buffet, which has been serving sandwiches and
pouring drinks since 1908.</TE>
<TE>   Cole's and other retailers will stay on the ground floor, said
project architect Barbara Flammang of Killefer Flammang Architects.
The lobby was renovated after World War II and has a distinctive
flair even though it's not the original design.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to keep it in the 1949 Deco style," Flammang said.
"It's very cool the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   Like most developers of historic properties, Moradi is taking
advantage of local and federal tax incentive programs that encourage
their preservation.</TE>
<TE>   To qualify for state housing funds, he will set aside 20% of his
units for tenants whose annual incomes fall below 50% of the county
median of $44,100 for a two-person family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complicated way to finance a project," said Amy Anderson
of the Los Angeles Conservancy, an advocacy group for historic
preservation. "But lenders aren't necessarily dropping from the sky"
to fund building conversions in old Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Eager developers, however, do seem to be arriving by parachute
monthly. Owners of at least 30 historic buildings have announced
plans for housing conversions or are in various stages of
development.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is the Subway Terminal Building, a 1926 edifice on Hill
Street that once served Red Cars heading west.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now there is not the support or infrastructure to allow new
tenants to feel completely at home," said Davey, chief executive of
Albion Pacific Property Resources, which is developing the Higgins
Building. "That's the biggest gamble for a developer. But eventually
downtown will be a city within a city, vibrant with new life."</TE>

<LD>Pixar Animation Studios on Monday reported its largest quarterly
profit in the company's history thanks to strong home video and DVD
sales of its latest blockbuster film, "Monsters, Inc."</LD>
<LD>   The Emeryville, Calif.-based company reported a net profit of
$46.9 million in the third quarter, more than seven times the $6.2
million it netted a year earlier. The profit in the latest quarter
was 87 cents a share, beating Wall Street estimates, compared with 12
cents in the same period a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Pixar's revenue for the three months ended Sept. 28 jumped
dramatically to $102.5 million, up from $11.3 million in the same
quarter last year.</LD>
<TE>   Because Pixar's revenue and profit are cyclical and depend on the
timing of its new movie releases and video/DVD launches, the
company's year-to-date results can show significant swings. A year
ago, Pixar was between movies, just before the release of "Monsters,
Inc.," which was a huge box-office hit with more than $530 million
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Under its current five-picture deal with Walt Disney Co., Pixar
splits revenue and profit and the two companies share all production
and marketing costs.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent quarter Pixar sold 25 million home videos and
DVDs of "Monsters, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   Based on its strong third-quarter results, Pixar raised its
earnings estimates for the full year to between $1.50 and $1.55 a
share, up from $1.25 to $1.35 a share it previously projected.</TE>
<TE>   On a conference call with analysts, Pixar Chairman Steve Jobs, who
also is the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc., said Pixar's
"business model we set in motion years ago is working very, very
well."</TE>
<TE>   Jobs skirted questions about the ongoing uncertainty surrounding
Pixar's future partnership with Disney and his strained relationship
with Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar owes Disney three more movies under the current deal, which
means the companies will be in business at least through 2005.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Pixar delivers its next film, "Finding Nemo," this
spring, Jobs will be free to cut a deal with another studio if he
chooses. It is widely known that he favors an arrangement in which
Pixar would retain more of the profit.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of leadership and structural changes going on ...
at Vivendi Universal, AOL Time Warner and those rumored at Disney,"
Jobs said in an interview. "We have the luxury of seeing how that all
plays out."</TE>
<TE>   Jobs said that like any long-term relationship Pixar's partnership
with Disney has had the usual "ups and downs."</TE>
<TE>   And what about his relationship with Eisner? "Let's talk about
that next year," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pixar shares rose $2.35 to $55.30 on Nasdaq. Pixar's shares have
climbed 54% this year. The news was released after the market closed.</TE>

<HD>New Twist in Disney Conflict Over Pooh</HD>
<DH>The entertainment firm says that the family of the author
and the artist invoked copyright laws to reclaim their rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. disclosed Monday what could become the legal
equivalent of getting stuck in a honey jar for a Florida company
locked in a battle over hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties
from the sale of Winnie the Pooh merchandise.</LD>
<LD>   But a lawyer for the Florida company called the latest development
in the long-running case nothing more than legal gamesmanship by
Disney, and predicted the ploy will eventually fail.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven years ago Disney was sued by Stephen Slesinger Inc., a firm
controlled by the family of the late literary agent who secured
rights to sell Pooh merchandise in the 1930s. Shirley Slesinger
Lasswell, and her daughter Patricia Slesinger, turned those rights
over to Disney for a share of Pooh merchandising sales, but they
contend the Burbank-based entertainment giant has cheated them out of
at least $200 million in royalties.</LD>
<TE>   The Slesingers went to Los Angeles Superior Court in an effort to
end their Disney contract. Their aim is to be able to shop their Pooh
rights elsewhere. A trial is scheduled for next year.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney said that the granddaughters of Pooh author A.A. Milne,
and artist E. H. Shepard, on Monday invoked U.S. copyright laws to
reclaim their rights to the lovable bear in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said the two women simultaneously will grant back to Disney
exclusive rights to Pooh merchandise, film, DVD, clothing and other
rights under a fresh agreement. On Monday the two women gave both
Disney and the Slesingers the two-year notice required by copyright
law before they can "recapture" the Pooh rights, Disney said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney said that the copyright notice would not affect the current
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   The Slesingers' lawyer, Bert Fields, predicted that the copyright
tactic will not survive legal challenges and disputed Disney's claim
that the Pooh rights can be so easily shifted because of an existing
contract between the Slesingers and Disney. He called it an attempt
by Disney to "sneak around the agreement" they have with the family.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be in violation of the agreement they entered into,"
Fields said. "This is another attempt by Disney to get out of paying
what they have promised."</TE>
<TE>   Disney spokesman John Spelich said that U.S. copyright law allows
the two women, Milne's granddaughter Clare Milne and Shepard's
granddaughter Minette Hunt, to cut a new deal that excludes the
Slesingers in November 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, it would appear that they're out," Spelich said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Merck &amp; Co. said a U.S. district court judge upheld its patent
protection for osteoporosis medicine Fosamax.</LD>
<LD>   The company said Judge Joseph Farnan of the U.S. District Court in
Wilmington, Del., ruled Merck's key patent covering Fosamax is valid
and would be infringed by two proposed generic versions made by Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Ivax Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling ensures Merck will have patent protection for Fosamax
until 2007.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck fell 38 cents to
$53.68 on the NYSE before the news was announced.</TE>

<LD>The Treasury Department auctioned $17 billion in three-month bills at
a discount rate of 1.410%. Another $17 billion in six-month bills was
auctioned at a discount rate of 1.395%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was down from 1.550% last week and was the
lowest since 1.164% on Aug. 4, 1958. The six-month rate was down from
1.515% last week and was the lowest since the government started
selling these bills in 1958.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 1.433% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,964.40, and 1.424% for a six-month bill selling for $9,929.50.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making
changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 1.51% last week from
1.79% the previous week.</TE>

<LD>Online movie-ticket service Fandango Inc. of Los Angeles and AOL
Moviefone, a subsidiary of AOL Time Warner Inc., have settled their
battle over the right to sell tickets for Loews Cineplex
Entertainment Corp. theaters. The settlement, which is expected to be
announced formally today, leaves Fandango holding the exclusive
rights to Loews, a founding partner of Fandango.</LD>
<LD>   The legal battle, which stretched across several courts, erupted
as Loews was reorganizing under the protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York. Fandango accused Moviefone of trying to induce
Loews to break its contract with Fandango; a federal bankruptcy judge
ruled in August that Loews was bound by the agreement.</LD>
<LD>   Financial details of the settlement were not disclosed. A division
of Canadian holding company Onex Corp., Loews Cineplex is one of six
theater chains aligned with Fandango.</LD>

<LD>Dow Chemical Co. and Monsanto Co., the two biggest makers of Agent
Orange, won Supreme Court review of their effort to stop a new round
of suits over the cancer-causing defoliant used in Vietnam. The case
may help businesses settle group personal injury claims.</LD>
<LD>   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Dow, Monsanto and 11
other companies that a 1984 settlement is binding on two men seeking
to sue them. A federal appeals court allowed the suit by Daniel
Stephenson and Joe Isaacson, who developed cancer after the 1994
deadline for seeking payment from the $180-million settlement fund.</LD>

will delay its third-quarter earnings report.</LD>
<LD>   Accountants found "miscalculations" in second-quarter results
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and errors in
earlier periods, the company said. Allegheny, which owns utilities in
five states, didn't disclose what the errors were.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Allegheny, based in Hagerstown, Md., rose 17 cents to
$5.78 on the New York Stock Exchange.</LD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CMS Energy Corp. said it may quit the wholesale energy trading
business after internal reviews confirmed bogus transactions and
found phony pricing reports.</LD>
<LD>   CMS Energy, whose chief executive and top trading executive
resigned this year, is considering "strategic alternatives" for the
power-trading business, including a complete exit, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   One review found that CMS traders inflated their business using
"round-trip" trades in which they simultaneously bought and sold
power at the same quantity and price. Another probe found that
traders provided false natural-gas prices to industry publications
that use the information to compile pricing indexes.</LD>

<HD>High Court Refuses Cigarette Suit</HD>
<DH>Case had been filed by Canada against R.J. Reynolds over
alleged smuggling. Action could aid tobacco industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myron Levin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tobacco industry scored a legal victory Monday when the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear a cigarette smuggling case filed by the
government of Canada against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</LD>
<LD>   Canada had asked the court to reinstate the suit, in which it
accused RJR and several affiliates of violating U.S.
anti-racketeering laws by colluding with smugglers during the 1990s
to sell billions of cigarettes on the Canadian black market in a
giant tax evasion scheme.</LD>
<LD>   In a 2-1 decision last year, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a lower court ruling that the case was barred by the revenue
rule, a 17th century doctrine that prevents foreign countries from
pursuing alleged tax cheats in U.S. courts.</LD>
<TE>   Canada argued in its appeal that the rule had been interpreted too
broadly and that it was not seeking unpaid taxes but damages for
violations of U.S. fraud and anti-racketeering laws.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very disappointed that the court decided that the time
wasn't ripe for review," said Gordon Bourgard, senior general counsel
with the Canadian Department of Justice. Bourgard described the
decision as "at cross purposes" with combating international
cigarette smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether an action now will be brought in Canadian courts,
Bourgard said only that officials "are considering possible next
steps."</TE>
<TE>   RJR hailed the court's decision. This "is another affirmation that
foreign governments cannot use our country's judicial system to
enforce their revenue laws," said Martin L. Holton III, RJR vice
president and assistant general counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Although RJR is the immediate beneficiary, the action also could
benefit Philip Morris Cos., British-American Tobacco and other firms
defending anti-smuggling claims. Suits by Belize, Ecuador, Honduras,
the European Union and a group of Colombian states have all been
dismissed and are winding their way through appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union last week filed a separate lawsuit against RJR
that seeks to avoid colliding with the revenue rule. In that case,
filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., the EU accused the
company of engaging in money laundering to conceal its dealings with
narcotics traffickers and other criminals who allegedly distribute
its cigarettes in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's action was not unexpected because the court had sought
the advice of the Bush administration, which took the position that
the revenue rule applied. The court requested the input in May from
the solicitor general, though the government did not stake out its
position until last month in a friend-of-the-court brief.</TE>
<TE>   Three high-ranking Bush administration lawyers had removed
themselves from the case because of tobacco industry ties.</TE>
<TE>   Solicitor General Theodore B. Olsen recused himself because within
days of his appointment in February 2001. He had filed a friend-of
the-court brief with the 2nd Circuit on behalf of the National Assn.
of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in support of RJR's
position in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Olsen's No. 2, principal Deputy Solicitor General Paul Clement,
recused himself because his former law firm, King &amp; Spalding,
represented the Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers Council, RJR's
co-defendant in the Canadian case.</TE>
<TE>   And Treasury Department General Counsel David Aufhauser also
disqualified himself because Williams &amp; Connolly, where he was a
partner until last year, has worked for RJR and other tobacco
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who did sign the administration's brief was Robert D.
McCallum Jr., who was confirmed in May 2001 as head of the Justice
Department's civil division.</TE>
<TE>   McCallum, a Yale classmate of Bush, had been a longtime partner at
Alston &amp; Bird, an Atlanta-based firm that does trademark and patent
work for RJR. Neither McCallum nor the firm took part in the
smuggling case; RJR officials told The Times that they did not think
McCallum had represented them in other matters.</TE>
<TE>   Under ethics rules, a government lawyer would be barred from
involvement in a case if he or she had worked on the matter as a
private attorney.</TE>
<TE>   McCallum could not be reached, but a Justice Department spokesman
said its ethics office had cleared him.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in September that the 2-1 appeals court
majority that rejected Canada's claim included federal District Judge
Lewis A. Kaplan, a one-time tobacco industry lawyer who was sitting
as a visiting judge with the 2nd Circuit when he cast the swing vote
on Canada's appeal in October 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan's former law firm, Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton &amp; Garrison,
represented tobacco companies from the 1970s through 1990s.</TE>

<HD>Southland Economic Indicator Falls</HD>
<DH>The index shows weakness in the labor market and consumer
confidence, suggesting recovery may soon stall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An indicator of the Southland's economic growth fell for the second
straight quarter, raising concern that the region's already slow
recovery is on the verge of stalling.</LD>
<LD>   Cal State Fullerton said Monday that its Southern California index
of leading economic indicators declined by 0.45% in the third quarter
of 2002. It follows a revision to the index's second-quarter
performance showing a drop of 0.61% from April to June.</LD>
<LD>   Adrian Fleissig, the creator of the indicator, said the
back-to-back quarterly decline was worse than expected and bodes ill
for the region's economic prospects over the next three to six
months.</LD>
<TE>   "This suggests quite a bit of a slowdown," Fleissig said. "If
there is going to be improvement, it's going to be toward the end of
next year."</TE>
<TE>   The decline in the index mirrors other recent data showing the
U.S. recovery is stumbling.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's U.S. index of leading indicators dipped
0.2% in September. It marked the fourth straight month that index has
declined, and has heightened worries about a so-called double-dip
recession.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the seven components of the Southern California index
fell in the third quarter, led by a major decline in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 stock index and a steep drop in the Pacific region
consumer confidence index.</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California index also reflected weakness in the
region's labor market, where unemployment has increased over the last
year and payroll employment has declined in the major population
centers of Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not clear at this stage where more employment is going to
come from," Fleissig said. "That is a major concern."</TE>
<TE>   The index projects regional economic activity for a six-county
area consisting of Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Ventura and Imperial counties.</TE>
<TE>   It tracks seven national and regional components.</TE>
<TE>   The national variables are money supply, interest rates and the
S&amp;P 500 index. The regional components are nonfarm employment, the
unemployment rate, building permits and Pacific region consumer
confidence.</TE>

<HD>Tax Evaders Use False Import, Export Prices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. companies and individuals avoided more than $50 billion in taxes
last year by falsely reporting prices for imports and exports,
according to a study that says the practice may be helping
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Toilet paper from China was declared to be worth $1,873 a pound,
and prefabricated buildings valued at $1.20 each went to Trinidad,
according to finance professors John Zdanowicz and Simon Pak, who are
advising the Treasury Department.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of it is companies and individuals moving money for illicit
or illegal purposes, including tax evasion and perhaps terrorist
financing," said Zdanowicz, who teaches at Florida International
University in Miami.</LD>
<TE>   More than $150 billion in taxable income was shifted outside the
U.S. through overpayment for imported goods and undercharging for
exports, the study said. The practice has accelerated in recent years
as taxpayers looked for alternatives to loopholes that are being
closed worldwide, the study said.</TE>
<TE>   The cost to the U.S. Treasury has almost doubled since 1992, the
first year that the pair began analyzing the data, and has risen
almost 20% since 2000, said Zdanowicz and Pak, who teaches at
Pennsylvania State University-Great Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The figure probably will rise faster now that the Patriot Act,
passed by Congress this year to help fight terrorism, has given
government broad new surveillance powers related to financial
transactions, Zdanowicz said.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has shut down the front door to moving money
offshore, but they've left the back door wide open: the trade
account," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The chances of government scrutiny are slim, Zdanowicz said. U.S.
Customs Service figures that were used in the study detail neither
the companies nor the individuals behind each transaction. "There are
54.9 million transactions each year, and no one can expect Treasury
or Customs or the IRS to look at every one of them," he said.</TE>

<HD>State's Teachers Face Tax 'Shock'</HD>
<DH>Legislators' suspension, for at least one year, of an
incentive that saved $250 to $1,500 may come as a surprise to some
instructors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California teachers are in for an unpleasant surprise come April:
They've lost a substantial personal income tax credit for 2002.</LD>
<LD>   State legislators, trying to close a massive budget gap, have
suspended for at least one year the widely used Teacher Retention Tax
Credit, which the Franchise Tax Board said was claimed by 214,166
educators in the 2001 tax year.</LD>
<LD>   Suspension of the credit, which reduced a teacher's California
income tax by $250 to $1,500 depending on the number of years of
service, will cost the state's teachers about $165.4 million in
additional state tax -- an average of $772 per teacher claiming the
break.</LD>
<TE>   Legislators agreed in September to suspend the credit, but the
change hasn't been widely reported.</TE>
<TE>   The credit was aimed at getting teachers to stay in their jobs
despite the notoriously low pay compared with other professions, said
Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Assn. in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "The teachers who claimed this are upset about losing it," Johnson
said. "Theoretically, the suspension is just for one year. But we
don't know that for sure because we're facing a big budget shortfall
again."</TE>
<TE>   About half of the state's teachers quit during the first four
years of their service, said Steve Blazak, director of communications
for the United Teachers of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That made the credit, just 2 years old, an important tool in
efforts to retain teachers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This comes as a real shock to teachers," Blazak said. "It was
something that they had last year and now it's gone. There wasn't
much said about it either."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, California tax preparers said they were trying to get the
word out to the state's teachers because those who were counting on
the credit are likely to have too little state tax withheld from
their paychecks this year. That could leave them facing additional
taxes when they file 2002 returns in early 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers wouldn't be subject to penalties, however: Penalties
aren't assessed on taxpayers who underpay because of a change in
state law, said Lynn Freer, editor of the Spidell California Tax
Letter.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a big credit," said Jennifer MacMillan, a professional
tax preparer in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers who were counting on this definitely need to consider
adjusting their withholding."</TE>
<TE>   The Teacher Retention Tax Credit provided a dollar-for-dollar
reduction in state income taxes paid by classroom instructors in
kindergarten through 12th grade. It did not provide breaks to school
nurses, counselors or administrators.</TE>
<TE>   The credit worked on a sliding scale, providing a $250 credit for
those with four or five years of experience; a $500 break for those
with six to 10 years of experience; a $1,000 break for those with 11
to 19 years in the profession and a $1,500 tax reduction for those
who had been teaching for 20 years or more.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a teacher who has been counting on this, they could
potentially owe $1,500 [more] in tax" for 2002, Freer said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a big chunk of cash to have to come up with at the last
minute."</TE>

<HD>Priest's Heart 'Trauma' Triggers Tenet Probe</HD>
<DH>Consultant will review allegations. Firm also will
investigate.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>REDDING</DL>
<LD>There came a moment, as Father John Corapi tried to absorb the
stunning prospect of immediate triple bypass surgery, when a
technician at Redding Medical Center questioned the priest about
where his parish was located.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't have a parish," Corapi recalls replying.</LD>
<LD>   "What do you do then?" the technician asked.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a lecturer in medical ethics," Corapi said.</TE>
<TE>   But since his visit last June to the Tenet Healthcare Corp.
facility, Corapi has turned into more than just a lecturer. He has
become a medical-industry whistle-blower -- triggering a federal
investigation into whether doctors at Redding Medical Center have
been steering patients into heart surgeries they haven't really
needed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scrambling to draw up a will," Corapi recounted in an
interview here late Sunday night. "It was a traumatic experience."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, after the 55-year-old Corapi developed suspicions
about his diagnosis by Redding's Dr. Chae Moon, he took his concerns
to his health insurer, to the California Medical Board and eventually
to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Last Wednesday, the FBI raided the medical center and the offices
of Moon, as well as those of his colleague, Dr. Fidel Realyvasquez.
Investigators are looking into whether the two doctors have performed
numerous unnecessary heart procedures on Medicare patients since at
least 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The doctors have not been charged with anything, and a lawyer for
one of them has characterized the probe as a dispute between
physicians and insurers over what constitutes proper medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, officials at Santa Barbara-based Tenet on Monday
stepped up efforts to reassure investors they are taking the matter
seriously, saying they have hired a national medical consultant to
review the allegations against Moon and Realyvasquez. Tenet said
Mercer Consulting Group also will review any future procedures the
two doctors intend to perform at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the company said it has dispatched a team of internal
experts to Redding to examine all aspects of the hospital's
high-volume cardiology department. The 238-bed hospital reported
performing 923 open-heart surgeries and more than 16,000
catheterizations in the 12 months ended May 31, 2001, according to
the latest annual disclosure report filed with California's Office of
Statewide Health Planning and Development.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet added that the company plans to extend its internal review
to other hospitals that have a high volume of specialized services,
such as cardiology and neurology. The company has been pursuing a
strategy to build up these programs, and some analysts have
questioned whether that may have fostered a culture of aggressively
treating patients at Redding and other hospitals. By handling more
critical and complicated cases, Tenet has received an unusually large
share of special Medicare reimbursements, which also have come under
scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Tenet's stock jumped 9% early Monday morning, in part reflecting
the company's long conference call with investors Friday, but by
day's end shares closed up just 50 cents, or 2%, to $27 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Tenet was hit with two class-action investor
lawsuits, one on each coast. The law firm Milberg Weiss said it filed
a suit in California accusing Tenet officers of misrepresenting the
company's finances. Wolf Popper LLP, in a complaint brought in New
York, accused Tenet of securities fraud, saying that the company knew
about the federal raid at Redding on Wednesday but failed to disclose
the information until the next day.</TE>
<TE>   In Corapi's case, rather than agree to the immediate bypass
surgery recommend by Moon, he called to seek the advice of a friend
in Nevada who had convinced him to have his heart checked out in the
first place. The friend suggested that he come to Nevada to have the
surgery. He went to a cardiologist in Las Vegas, expecting to soon
land on the operating table.</TE>
<TE>   "My father had a history of cardiovascular problems, so I went to
confession," Corapi said. "I wasn't taking any chances."</TE>
<TE>   But the cardiologist told him something unexpected: He was fine.</TE>
<TE>   In time, four other Las Vegas cardiologists concurred that there
was nothing wrong with his heart and that he did not require a bypass
operation. All of the Nevada doctors reviewed the results of tests
performed by Moon.</TE>
<TE>   Corapi said that he asked the Nevada doctors if it could have been
a simple mistake by Moon or a difference in judgment. The answer he
received, he recounted, chilled him: He was told there was no way to
look at his tests and legitimately conclude that he needed immediate
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "This was black and white," Corapi said. "It wasn't an error."</TE>
<TE>   Armed with the far different conclusion of the Nevada doctors,
Corapi returned to Redding Medical Center looking for answers and an
explanation. What he says he got from the medical center's Chief
Executive, Hal Chilton, was a strong defense of Moon's diagnosis and
another hard sell that he needed the surgery and could be
accommodated that very afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Corapi said that he returned to Nevada again seeking the
reassurance of his doctors there, and they again confirmed that
surgery was unnecessary. Corapi said that he again contacted Chilton
by telephone and that Redding officials again tried to convince him
that the surgery was needed.</TE>
<TE>   Chilton, contacted at his home Saturday night, would not comment
and referred questions to Tenet.</TE>
<TE>   A Tenet spokesman confirmed that Moon conducted a coronary
angiogram and an ultrasound test on Corapi, and that Redding
officials met with the priest more than once to recommend surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Harry Anderson said Monday that Moon is an expert at
reading and interpreting ultrasounds, suggesting that the Nevada
doctors are not.</TE>
<TE>   "How often have those doctors performed that test? How many have
they read?" Anderson asked, adding that hospital officials might have
referred the matter for a further examination if another cardiologist
they interviewed had not concurred with Moon's analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Moon's attorney, John Reese Jr., did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Corapi's lawyer, Dugan Barr, and another Redding attorney, Russ
Reiner, said their law offices separately had been interviewing
several dozen people who had been operated on by Moon or
Realyvasquez.</TE>
<TE>   Both lawyers said they were about to begin the long process of
having each case reviewed by independent cardiologists to see whether
the surgeries had been medically necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Barr said that he probably would consult with several
cardiologists, adding that those who had contacted him seemed to
indicate that "if you went into that [emergency room] complaining
about pain anywhere from your chest to your abdomen they would try to
do" a heart examination "on you."</TE>
<TE>   Said Reiner: "We've already talked to between 50 and 60 former
patients who are from all over California and some are from as far
away as Utah and Nevada."</TE>
<TE>   Reiner added that some of the people coming forward seem to be fit
47- to 52-year-olds who watch their diets, exercise and possess few
bad health habits.</TE>
<TE>   Corapi, for his part, runs three miles at a clip several times a
week. "I came within minutes of having a triple bypass," he marveled,
"and all the other doctors said this was not even a close call."</TE>

<HD>Trizec Loss Widens After Write-Downs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David M. Levitt</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trizec Properties Inc.'s third-quarter loss widened as the
second-largest U.S. office owner on Monday again cut the value of its
two biggest retail projects, including a Hollywood development that
is the home of the Academy Awards show.</LD>
<LD>   The net loss increased to $254.3 million, or $1.70 a share, from
$8.49 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, the co-owner of Chicago's
Sears Tower said. Revenue rose 5.7% to $244 million in the quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company wrote down its investments in the Hollywood &amp; Highland
retail and office complex by $181.4 million and in the Desert Passage
Mall at the bankrupt Aladdin Casino in Las Vegas by $57 million. It
also wrote down its investment in Sears Tower's second mortgage by
$48.3 million.</LD>
<TE>   After a failed diversification into European real estate, U.S.
retail space and "telecom hotels" that house switching equipment,
Trizec chose to focus on U.S. offices just as vacancies were rising
to a five-year high. Chairman Peter Munk in August hired Timothy
Callahan, formerly of Equity Office Properties Trust, as the second
chief executive since Trizec changed strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Lower-than-expected returns from the Hollywood &amp; Highland and
Desert Passage properties contributed to a 35% drop in New York-based
Trizec's share price this year.</TE>
<TE>   The write-downs on the two properties are the second this year.
Trizec took a $239.4-million charge in the first quarter on the
Hollywood &amp; Highland project, which opened a year ago, citing cost
overruns and the post-Sept. 11 decline in tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The property, which originally was valued at $615 million,
encompasses cinemas, television studios, a hotel, restaurants and the
Kodak Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the Desert Passage property was $260 million before
Monday's write-down.</TE>
<TE>   Munk, reiterated he intends to sell the retail properties and
focus on office buildings.</TE>

<HD>Safety Features for 15-Passenger Vans Urged</HD>
<DH>The NTSB asks vehicle manufacturers GM and Ford to take
steps to reduce rollover risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. safety investigators, concerned about rollover crashes, have
asked regulators as well as General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
to take steps to improve the safety of 15-passenger vans.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board wrote to the chief
executives of both companies Friday, recommending the manufacturers
look into technology that would help drivers maintain better control
of these vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   "The safety board is vitally interested in this recommendation
because it is designed to prevent accidents and save lives," said
Carol Carmody, the board's acting chairwoman, in a letter to Ford
Chairman William Clay Ford Jr. and Rick Wagoner, GM's president.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate letter, the safety board urged the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to include 15-passenger vans in its
enhanced rating system for measuring rollover risk.</TE>
<TE>   Regulators are developing a road test to determine rollover
propensity, which is now based on vehicle measurements. That system
will rate cars and light trucks, which include pickups, sport utility
vehicles and minivans.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll certainly consider it," said NHTSA spokesman Rae Tyson.
"Anytime the NTSB sends a recommendation we'll consider it
seriously."</TE>
<TE>   The safety board has no regulatory authority.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen-passenger vans are typically used by community groups for
short trips as well as by colleges for their athletic teams and
student organizations. Vanpools also use them for commuters.</TE>
<TE>   According to highway safety data, large vans are involved in a
higher number of single-vehicle accidents involving rollovers than
are other passenger vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 500,000 15-passenger vans on the road, and at
least 424 people have been killed and hundreds of others hurt in
rollover crashes involving these vehicles since 1990, highway traffic
figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Two NHTSA advisories in the last two years, prompted by
high-profile crashes, have warned consumers about the increased
rollover risk of 15-passenger vans in certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Rollover risk is heightened if the vehicle is fully loaded or
nearly full. Safety experts also say their extended length, a higher
center of gravity and restricted handling capabilities can make them
vulnerable to rollover.</TE>
<TE>   Ford builds the most 15-passenger vans. GM has only a small
fraction of the market. Because of a difference in design, the GM
vans are involved in fewer rollovers than those made by other
manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   Ford spokeswoman Carolyn Brown said the automaker stood behind the
safety of its product but said the operating manual for vans includes
warnings about overloading and driving the vehicle at high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   GM also backed the safety of its 15-seat vans. Mike Morrissey, a
spokesman for the company, said GM welcomed the safety board's
recommendation as a "constructive suggestion."</TE>
<TE>   The safety board recommended that automakers consider a range of
technologies to give drivers more control of 15-passenger vans. These
include traction-control features, devices that warn drivers when
they suddenly leave a traffic lane, and computer systems that can
brake individual wheels or adjust power to enhance steering control.</TE>

<HD>Venture Firms' Funds Drop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. venture capital firms collected $1.7 billion for 33 new funds in
the third quarter, a 76% plunge from a year earlier, according to a
survey by an industry trade group.</LD>
<LD>   Five funds accounted for almost two-thirds of the total collected,
reflecting the tough times smaller funds are having attracting
investors.</LD>
<LD>   Venture funds that invest in start-up businesses have scaled back
their ambitions as the technology sector has crashed and the long
bear market on Wall Street has made it difficult for venture
investors to cash out of their companies by taking them public.</LD>
<TE>   "The venture capital industry is clearly in the process of
returning itself to equilibrium," said Mark Heesen, president of the
National Venture Capital Assn., which released the survey.</TE>
<TE>   The third-quarter's fund-raising was 94% less than the quarterly
peak of $30.8 billion recorded two years earlier. In the same period
last year, venture firms raised $7 billion for 69 funds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, venture firms have an estimated $90 billion to invest, the
association said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the leading fund-raisers in the third quarter, Alta
Communications raised $422 million, QuestMark Partners $228 million,
Adams Street Partners $148.5 million, Schroder Venture Partners $150
million and Sofinnova Ventures $110 million, the group said.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Faces U.S. Attorney and SEC Probes</HD>
<DH>Investigators are expected to focus on stock transactions
and statements by Messier, sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already under scrutiny by authorities in Paris over whether it
concealed a financial crisis, Vivendi Universal on Monday confirmed
that it also is the target of a criminal investigation by the U.S.
attorney's office in New York and a probe by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The investigations are further complicating efforts to restore
confidence in the French media giant and are expected to parallel
similar inquiries already underway in France, sources familiar with
the probes said. French prosecutors last week opened an investigation
into whether the company published "false accounts" for 2000 and 2001
to hide its cash crunch from investors. France's stock market
regulator also is examining financial information that Vivendi has
released since January 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi described the investigation by the U.S. attorney's office
in the Southern District of New York as preliminary and said the
SEC's Miami office will be coordinating its own probe with federal
prosecutors.</LD>
<TE>   Vivendi promised to cooperate fully with investigators and
declined to provide further details.</TE>
<TE>   In their investigations, U.S. authorities are expected to focus on
a series of stock transactions former Vivendi Chief Executive
Jean-Marie Messier reportedly made to bolster Vivendi's lagging share
price without the knowledge of Vivendi's board of directors and
former Chief Financial Officer Guillaume Hannezo, sources familiar
with the probes said.</TE>
<TE>   The probes, they said, also probably will examine whether Messier
misled investors by, among other things, issuing a statement June 26
emphatically denying that Vivendi faced any liquidity problems. Just
a week later, Messier was ousted, and new CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou
declared that Vivendi was on the verge of defaulting on its bank
loans. Credit firms quickly lowered the company's rating to "junk"
status on concern the conglomerate was running out of cash.</TE>
<TE>   The French and U.S. investigations follow a series of news reports
and 16 shareholder lawsuits and complaints filed in France,
California and New York centering on Messier's activities.</TE>
<TE>   The flamboyant executive pushed Vivendi to spend more than $70
billion in three years to transform a staid water utility into a
rival of media giant AOL Time Warner Inc., with assets including
Universal's movie studio, theme parks and leading music labels.</TE>
<TE>   But the strategy puzzled investors and left the company with
crippling media debts of $19 billion and the worst loss in French
corporate history, triggering an 80% slide in Vivendi's stock price
this year. Vivendi shares closed Monday at $12.05, down 43 cents, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Messier, who has since launched his own private equity investment
firm, declined to comment on the U.S. investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Messier's attorney, Olivier Metzner, said last week that his
client did nothing wrong. In an interview last month, Messier would
not answer specific questions about Vivendi's financial crisis, but
said neither its lenders nor anyone at the company thought Vivendi
Universal was facing a solvency problem. He suggested that the
company's financial crisis was largely created by unfavorable media
reports and market rumors.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Kim, a media analyst with Kaufman Bros., said the revelations
about the new investigations were alarming. "This raises the level of
questions about the company," he said. "It opens a whole new can of
worms."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said in September that PricewaterhouseCoopers had studied
its accounting and had not found any evidence of irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   The widening investigations come at an especially bad time for
Fourtou, who has been working hard to restore investor confidence in
Vivendi and improve the company's balance sheet by unloading some of
the businesses Messier cobbled together.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Vivendi agreed to sell U.S. publisher Houghton Mifflin
Co. to a group of investors led by Blackstone Group for about $1.75
billion in cash and assumed debt. Last month, the company sold the
rest of its publishing business to Lagardere for about $1.25 billion.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent weeks, Fourtou has reversed course and made some
investors nervous by weighing whether to wage a bidding war with
British cell phone giant Vodafone for French telecom operator
Cegetel. Last week, Vivendi's board rejected as inadequate a
$6.7-billion offer that Vodafone made for its 44% stake in Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York
is handling other high-profile cases, including a probe into
allegations of securities fraud by former officers of WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear why the SEC is conducting its probe
out of the Miami office. Vivendi's only business in that area, other
than the Universal theme parks in Orlando, Fla., is a firm in Delray
Beach that processes paychecks and expenses for Vivendi's U.S.
employees. Some industry insiders believe that the SEC may have
handed the investigation over to Miami because its New York office
has a backlog of cases.</TE>

<HD>Firm Says Webster's Statements Are False</HD>
<DH>BDO Seidman asserts he knew about problems at U.S.
Technologies before the auditor was fired.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>One of the nation's biggest accounting firms Monday accused William
H. Webster, who has been tapped to head the new federal accounting
oversight board, of making "false and misleading statements" about
his awareness of financial problems at a small company for which he
had been a director.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit by BDO Seidman deepens the controversy over Webster's
appointment to the board, though he said Monday he stood by his
previous statements about the company and his dealings with BDO.</LD>
<LD>   Revelations about Webster's service as a director at U.S.
Technologies Inc. last week triggered a new crisis of confidence in
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, who had
championed Webster for the oversight post.</LD>
<TE>   BDO Seidman said it told Webster of accounting troubles at U.S.
Technologies a month before the company fired the accounting firm in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's comments last week to the Washington Post, in which he
said BDO did not inform him of the problems until after the
termination, are "false and misleading," the firm said in a lawsuit
filed in federal court in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   BDO petitioned the court for permission to release confidential
information the firm said would prove that it warned Webster and
other members of U.S. Technologies' audit committee on July 13, 2001,
about significant "internal control" problems. U.S. Technologies
replaced BDO as its auditor Aug. 16, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The timing of the warning has become an "issue of national
interest" because of the controversy over Webster's appointment to
the accounting board, the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, 78, is a former federal judge and former director of the
FBI and the CIA.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear whether the law allows BDO to release the records
gathered in the course of a confidential audit, and the company is
seeking explicit permission, according to the suit, which names only
U.S. Technologies as a defendant. BDO had no further comment.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Monday, Webster said the audit committee held a
conference call with BDO on July 13, 2001, but he does not remember
the specifics of the meeting and has no notes from it.</TE>
<TE>   If BDO had issued a significant warning, he would have remembered
that and would have kept notes reflecting it, Webster said. The
absence of such notes "means to me that no bells went off" at the
July meeting, he said.</TE>
<TE>   BDO advised the company to make improvements, such as hiring an
experienced chief financial officer, in a letter dated Aug. 31, 2001,
Webster said. That was two weeks after the auditing firm had been
replaced.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Technologies subsequently made the changes BDO recommended,
Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Technologies fired BDO because it took the firm too long to
complete its annual audit and because it charged too much -- more
than $700,000 -- not because it had raised issues about internal
controls, Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   Webster's work at U.S. Technologies sparked a furor last week when
it was revealed that Webster had told SEC Chairman Pitt about U.S.
Technologies' troubles -- including that the firm has been sued by
shareholders alleging fraud -- in advance of the SEC's vote on
Webster's appointment to the accounting board.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt did not inform the other SEC commissioners or the White House
ahead of the vote. The SEC said Pitt referred the matter to agency
staff, which investigated but found "nothing of concern" to bring to
the other commissioners' attention, a Pitt spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations have spawned a number of investigations of Pitt's
conduct and new calls for his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Webster said he would think about resigning from the
accounting board if political issues involving him interfered with
the panel's mission.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to stay at the expense of the board doing its
work," Webster said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would consider stepping down at any time that I considered my
continued service to be an impediment to the board's work."</TE>

<HD>WorldCom Misstatement May Exceed $7 Billion</HD>
<DH>Federal examiner's report suggests ex-CEO Bernard Ebbers
guided events leading to bankruptcy filing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Stancavish</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CLINTON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc. may be forced to disclose that its accounting errors
exceed the $7 billion it has acknowledged, a federally appointed
investigator said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We believe our investigation will reveal that there were improper
and unsupported adjustments that go beyond the more than $7 billion
in adjustments already restated," former Atty. Gen. Richard L.
Thornburgh wrote in a report on the financial mismanagement that led
to WorldCom's collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Thornburgh's 122-page report suggested that former WorldCom Chief
Executive Bernard J. Ebbers guided events that led the nation's No. 2
long-distance telephone company to restate its earnings and file the
largest bankruptcy case in U.S. history in July. Ebbers, who was
forced to resign in April, told Congress in July that he had done
nothing wrong when he ran the company.</LD>
<TE>   Ebbers "appears to have dominated" the course of the company's
growth, agenda and decisions by the company's board of directors,
said Thornburgh, who was named by the Justice Department to
investigate the improper accounting that led to WorldCom's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "While Mr. Ebbers received more than $77 million in cash and
benefits from the company, shareholders lost in excess of $140
billion in value," Thornburgh wrote in the report to a U.S.
bankruptcy judge.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers, 61, built WorldCom by making 75 acquisitions since 1985.
He hasn't been charged with any crimes, though lawyers following the
case have said he is a target of investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Ebbers didn't return phone messages left at his office. Ebbers'
attorney, Reid Weingarten, said he hasn't read the Thornburgh report
and declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released at the same time Thornburgh's report was
filed with the Bankruptcy Court, WorldCom said it is taking steps to
restore confidence in the company, including doubling its internal
audit staff and appointing independent directors to its board.</TE>

<HD>Small Investors Grab State Power Bonds</HD>
<DH>Tax-exempt securities attract individuals, but some
institutional buyers say yields may have to go higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yield-hungry individual investors have put in orders to buy nearly
one-quarter of the tax-exempt power bonds the state will sell today,
underwriters said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But some of the institutional investors who are expected to buy
the balance of the bonds said the securities' yields may have to go
higher to make them worth taking.</LD>
<LD>   The $6.5-billion, fixed-rate bond issue by the Department of Water
Resources is the second and final phase of the biggest municipal bond
offering in history.</LD>
<TE>   Proceeds from the bonds will be used to repay loans that the state
took on to buy power during the energy crisis of 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The state invited small investors to place orders for the
securities on Friday and Monday, ahead of institutional orders.</TE>
<TE>   Through Monday afternoon underwriters had taken in orders totaling
$1.5 billion from individual investors, according to J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co., the deal's lead underwriter.</TE>
<TE>   A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman in San Francisco said the underwriters
and the state were "quite pleased" with the demand shown by
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The bonds, to be sold in maturities ranging from 2 1/2 years to 20
years, will pay interest that is exempt from state and federal income
tax for California residents.</TE>
<TE>   Because yields on U.S. Treasury securities and other high-quality
bonds are near generational lows, many investors who need income have
been eagerly anticipating the power bonds, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, underwriters quoted an annualized yield of 4.44% for
the 10-year uninsured portion of the offering. For an investor in the
34% combined federal and state marginal tax bracket, that yield would
be equivalent to 6.7% on a fully taxable investment, such as a bank
savings certificate.</TE>
<TE>   The state's offering will include uninsured and insured bonds. An
insured bond is guaranteed against the possibility of default by
private insurance the state purchases for the securities.</TE>
<TE>   However, that assurance comes with a price: Yields on insured
bonds usually are substantially lower than yields on uninsured
securities.</TE>
<TE>   The power bonds aren't direct obligations of the state. They are
to be repaid by surcharges on the electric bills of the state's major
utilities.</TE>
<TE>   Some big investors said Monday that, given the political and other
risks that could dog the bonds in the long run, the state may have to
offer higher yields to lure buyers for the remaining three-quarters
of the offering today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a complicated credit that presents more risks than a lot of
other credits in the marketplace, and investors should be compensated
for accepting these risks," said Gary Pollack, a municipal bond
principal with Deutsche Private Banking in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Pollack said he thinks yields should be as much as one-tenth of a
point higher than what underwriters were quoting Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But other analysts said demand from insurance companies and mutual
funds probably will be strong, which could keep yields near Friday's
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   If the final yields on the bonds come in lower than what
underwriters quoted to small investors on Friday, individual
investors will have the right to cancel their orders.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>China Telecom has relaunched a drastically scaled-down initial public
offering in a last-ditch effort to rescue its once-massive share sale
in Hong Kong and New York, according to sources familiar with the
deal.</LD>
<LD>   The firm, a unit of China's dominant fixed-line carrier, hopes to
raise between $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, according to an e-mail
sent to fund managers and confirmed by sources familiar with the
deal.</LD>
<LD>   The revised deal is about 55% smaller than previously planned.</LD>
<TE>   The state-owned carrier plans to sell 7.56 billion shares, to be
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Stock Market.</TE>
<TE>   It had planned to sell as many as 16.8 billion shares.</TE>
<TE>   Following pricing of the shares, trading in the stock is
tentatively set for Nov. 14 in New York and the following day in Hong
Kong, underwriters said.</TE>

<HD>Huge Pileup: Driving Blind in Dense Fog</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "41 Hurt in 198-Vehicle Smashup," Nov. 4: I've seen drivers go 70
mph and even 80 mph in fog so dense you couldn't see 10 feet. If you
slow down, you are in danger of getting hit from the rear. If you go
the same speed as these crazy people, you are endangering your own
life and everyone who may be driving slowly and sanely in front of
you. What are these fogbound fast drivers thinking? That everyone
will keep up the same speed? If they were suddenly blinded would they
keep driving? I was taught not to overdrive my lights at night, which
means don't drive faster than you can see.</LD>
<LD>   My answers to this problem: (1) Don't drive at all in the fog.
Pull over and let the insane people have the road. (2) Have the
California Highway Patrol escort cars, at about 20 mph, through dense
fog, as it has done at times. (3) Mount a massive advertising
campaign to show people how dangerous it is to overdrive one's
vision. I still can't believe that people are so stupid that they
don't slow down when they can't see. Of course, these are the same
people who follow one car length behind at 70 mph and who speed up in
the rain.</LD>

<LD>"White House Reinterpreting Law on Environmental Reviews" (Nov. 3)
should wake all Americans to the very real threat of destruction to
our national treasures. If the Bush administration succeeds in
reversing current environmental laws, the legacy of unspoiled
wilderness and wildlife habitat will be lost forever and will go the
way of the rapidly disappearing rain forests. Our children will be
denied the opportunity to observe and appreciate nature and all its
marvels.</LD>
<LD>   This is not just an issue for environmentalists; it affects
everyone. We should be doing all that we can to preserve these
special places. Once they are gone, they will never be restored.</LD>
<LD>   The Bureau of Land Management and the Department of the Interior
are out of control and need to weigh the consequences of their
actions. The Environmental Protection Agency's role in conservation
needs to be strengthened rather than being rendered impotent.</LD>

<LD>In his Nov. 3 commentary, John Balzar writes that "at least 41
million Americans lack medical insurance." In "PacifiCare Reports
Strong Earnings" (Business, Oct. 31), you state that PacifiCare
Health Systems reports strong earnings and that investors in that HMO
see their stock soar.</LD>

<LD>Re "Eli, My Friend, for $5 Million I Am All Yours," by Steve Lopez,
Nov. 2:</LD>
<LD>   Financier Eli Broad and, before him, former L.A. Mayor Richard
Riordan are in the business of buying trustees and influence on
school boards. Riordan got three in Los Angeles, and now Broad is
after Los Angeles Unified School District Board member David
Tokofsky.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez's column would be hysterical if it weren't so on the button.
Tokofsky is not for sale; that is why Broad had to look elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Tokofsky is an educator who is a voice of integrity and
intelligence on the board. Why don't Broad and Riordan look for other
people to support? How about helping out Cardinal Roger Mahony? I
hear he is losing some of his best people.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Broad Denies Gift Offer Was Improper," Nov. 2: We are
certainly being educated to the "boss" politics in the LAUSD. With
the selection or hiring, or both, of the superintendent of schools,
board members and senior staff, this buying of the system has cast a
shadow on the integrity of all of us. None of us is immune to the
damage being done.</TE>
<TE>   The Associated Administrators of Los Angeles has been shouting
this warning these past years. The question is, will the millions of
dollars of Broad and Riordan continue to buy the school district?</TE>
<TE>   Unless we all stand up and fight this manipulation of power, I
fear the answer will be yes.</TE>

<TE>   As parents who were deeply involved in the crisis last summer over
the transfer of Assistant Principal Jeff Kaufman from Hamilton High
School, we wish to thank Tokofsky for his efforts to fight an
injustice done to a terrific educator. He actually looked at the
facts regarding this transfer and in so doing bucked the school
board's blind loyalty to Supt. Roy Romer. His involvement was much
appreciated and is probably one of the reasons his head is now on the
chopping block. We appreciate and will remember his commitment to
what's best for the children of the LAUSD.</TE>

<LD>I take my duty as a citizen very seriously and therefore have voted
in every election since I came of age in 1971, with one exception. In
the 22 years I have lived in Santa Monica, I have needed an absentee
ballot three times. Two out of the three times I never received a
ballot -- once costing me an expensive one-day round-trip from Boston
just to vote. When confronted with these missing ballots, the office
of the registrar, after much prevarication, settled with: "It was
mailed." Not even an apology. As if that would wash with the tax
department if it hadn't received your check!</LD>
<LD>   In early September, knowing I would be abroad for three months, I
drove to the registrar's office in Norwalk (far from Santa Monica) to
make sure my request was acknowledged. I even had the clerk read back
my address in case of problems reading my handwriting. They assured
me the ballot would be mailed by Oct. 5. It is now Nov. 1; there is
no ballot. I shall be disenfranchised again. Considering all the
hullabaloo made over the last election, I would think there might be
less of this. I am furious! Does the registrar of L.A. County have
any idea how serious the job is, or is it just a cushy, bureaucratic
fiefdom?</LD>

<TE>   Pollsters expect this election to draw a record low voter turnout.
But in Turkey's election on Sunday, virtually all of that country's
41 million voters turned out to cast ballots. This is because they
were fined if they didn't.</TE>
<TE>   After much thought, I've decided to hell with the "you can lead a
horse to water, but you can't make it drink" system. Fine the horse
and he'll drink. Our democratic system and its apathetic voters have
become a worldwide embarrassment. Fine them and guarantee a
respectable turnout.</TE>

<TE>   Steve Lopez asks, "How come the country that can't stop pitching
democracy to the rest of the world is unable to conduct an election
that enlightens and engages the public?" (Nov. 3). This sentence
should be enshrined on the office wall of every person associated
with the slimy state of politics in our country.</TE>

<LD>As someone who attended the late Sen. Paul Wellstone's memorial
service and knew him personally, I am shocked and saddened at Michael
Ramirez's facile treatment of this deeply affecting remembrance
(editorial cartoon, Commentary, Nov. 1). The memorial service was in
no way scripted or orchestrated. The cameras that showed former Sen.
Walter Mondale in the audience were controlled by producers from
local TV stations.</LD>
<LD>   Though one of the speakers made some undoubtedly regrettable
remarks, they constituted only 10 minutes of what was otherwise an
emotionally stirring 2 1/2-hour service honoring Wellstone's family,
his life and his legacy. When asked to respond to the service, Rep.
Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) showed wisdom and class when he said: "People
get carried away sometimes with emotions. We all get carried away
sometimes with emotions. Just let it be."</LD>

<LD>Re "All Alone at the Marble Altar," by Steve Lopez, Nov. 1: Thank
goodness for a voice of rationality and compassion!</LD>
<LD>   During the Middle Ages, when the grand cathedrals of Europe were
constructed with golden altars and stained-glass windows, the common
people starved and died of terrible diseases in their hovels. Now we
build a $189-million Rog Mahal while people lie homeless in the
streets and others search for work.</LD>
<LD>   Significantly, Lopez is able to say what we need to hear without
being considered a heretic and burned at the stake.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Kosberg</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Recently I mailed a letter to Cardinal Roger Mahony, quoting
Vatican II saying that "the sacred pastors ... should recognize and
promote the dignity and responsibilities of the laity in the church."
The resignation of Mahony's five top advisors, four religious and one
lay person, is certainly representative of an archaic and potentially
destructive management style.</TE>
<TE>   In my view, the new cathedral is a magnificent and necessary
structure, but for Mahony to have raised $189 million for its
construction and then cut essential church ministries -- saving less
than $5 million -- is reprehensible.</TE>

<LD>Re "For Whales' Sake, Judge Halts Sonar," Nov. 1: Perhaps we must
sacrifice lumber for the owls. Perhaps we should not build homes
because of the birds and plants. Maybe humans should not enjoy the
desert because of rats, turtles and snakes. We even read recently
that there is a fly on the endangered species list.</LD>
<LD>   Now, U.S. Magistrate Elizabeth LaPorte wants to use the power of
her office to hamper military preparedness because of the whales.
Enough is enough. This is nothing less than using the legal system as
a form of terrorism. She should be prosecuted the same as any other
terrorist.</LD>

<LD>"The Final Mission Is Completed" (Nov. 2), about the missing World
War II P-51 Mustang pilot, was so well written it brought tears.
Adalbert Wolf, the kind German who found the remains, made a cross
but was thwarted from informing the pilot's heirs. This is such a
pleasant respite from the negative news.</LD>

<HD>Guilty Plea Entered in Slaying</HD>
<DH>Timothy Becker, 19, is the last of four defendants
convicted for the fatal beating of homeless veteran James Clark in
Ventura.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura teen pleaded guilty to second-degree murder Monday for
participating in the beachside slaying of a homeless man last year.</LD>
<LD>   Timothy Becker, 19, faces a minimum of 15 years in state prison
for kicking and beating homeless veteran James Clark, 58, as Clark
lay in a sleeping bag near a popular surf spot in Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorney Philip Capritto said Becker "is accepting
responsibility for his actions, and he is ready to go to prison for
his punishment."</LD>
<TE>   Becker is the last of four defendants to either be convicted or
plead guilty to the crime.</TE>
<TE>   A jury found Oak View resident Robert Coffman, 20, guilty of
first-degree murder last month for deliberately assaulting Clark. He
faces 25 years to life in prison when sentenced next week.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Dunham, 19, of Ventura pleaded guilty to second-degree
murder a week after Coffman was convicted. He also faces 15 years to
life in prison when sentenced Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Rocky Mattley, 15, of Ventura, was convicted of second-degree
murder in Juvenile Court earlier this year. He is serving a sentence
at the California Youth Authority.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a highly successful prosecution," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Stacy Ratner said Monday. "All four defendants were convicted of
murder. In terms of Mr. Clark, hopefully now he can rest in peace
knowing that these people who did this to him did not get away with
it."</TE>
<TE>   According to Ventura police, the four teens stumbled over Clark
while headed to a beach party near Surfers Point the night of June
30.</TE>
<TE>   They allegedly stole some of Clark's belongings, then returned to
his encampment where they kicked him, stomped on his head and threw
rocks at him. Clark died of multiple injuries, including a crushed
kidney, a broken rib and a possible skull fracture.</TE>
<TE>   Ratner said prosecutors had a strong case against Becker.</TE>
<TE>   All four teens admitted to assaulting "a bum" during police
interviews and implicated each other during talks with detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Ratner said prosecutors also had evidence that Becker struck Clark
in the head with a marijuana bong. Becker's blood, which police
suspect came from a cut to his finger, was found on the bong and on a
rock found near Clark's body.</TE>
<TE>   Capritto, who was recently appointed as Becker's lawyer, said his
client has no prior criminal record and got caught up with the wrong
crowd. He said Becker knew going to trial would be futile and decided
it would be better to spare the victim's family from further court
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Becker is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 13.</TE>

<HD>Remains Identified as Seal Beach Man</HD>
<DH>Dental records are used to make the determination almost 4
1/2 years after the man's wife reported him missing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skeletal remains found in a remote part of Joshua Tree National Park
in San Bernardino County were identified Monday as those of Joseph
Dimento, 60, a Seal Beach man who disappeared more than four years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I was stunned," said his wife, Uraiwan. "I always thought he was
alive somewhere doing volunteer work."</LD>
<LD>   She reported him missing in June 1998, a week after she said the
couple returned from a camping trip in Joshua Tree. She told Seal
Beach police at the time that on the way home, they'd had an argument
and he had left angrily with only his driver's license and $200 after
dropping her off at the house.</LD>
<TE>   She waited to report him missing, she said, because she knew him
to be moody and thought he was staying with friends. But several days
later, she said, she found his wallet -- with credit and ATM cards
inside -- in the bushes in front of their house and called police.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen months after the disappearance, Seal Beach Police Det.
Darrell Hardin, who'd been investigating the case, said he thought
the retired IBM repairman -- whose wife had put up a $100,000 reward
for information leading to his return -- was eking out an existence
somewhere under a different name. "It's easy to get false
identification," Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 28, however, a troop of Boy Scouts practicing land
navigation found the remains; Monday, the San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Department announced that the body had been identified
through dental records as that of the missing man.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time it's not known how he came to be in the park and
what led up to his death," said Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for the
San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. "We don't know if it was
homicide, suicide or accidental. We are waiting for the coroner's
office to determine the cause of death."</TE>
<TE>   A coroner's spokesman could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed by telephone Monday, Uraiwan Dimento, 62, suggested
several scenarios that could have led to her husband's death,
including murder, suicide and accidental exposure to the elements.</TE>
<TE>   "Any survival class will tell you not to go to Joshua Tree without
any [equipment]; in one or two nights the environment will kill you,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, she added, had been depressed for several months due
to pain in his heel.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sad that he could have had another 10 to 15 years of a
good life," she said. "Maybe you hang on to unrealistic things.
Everybody around me told me he might be dead, but I chose to believe
what I wanted to believe."</TE>
<TE>   She described Dimento as a "very nice husband" with whom she had
enjoyed a good life. "We were very happy," she said.</TE>

<HD>WWII Bomber Crewman Now Has Keepsakes From Plane's Wreckage</HD>
<DH>In a Newport Beach ceremony, Bernard Stelzer, a gunner
aboard the Bim Bam Bola, receives pieces found recently in
Switzerland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two fragments from a World War II bomber named the Bim Bam Bola --
which crashed in the Swiss Alps in 1944, five weeks after the
invasion of Normandy -- were presented to a surviving crew member
Monday during a ceremony in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Bernard Stelzer, a gunner on the bomber, and his wife, Edith,
received the wreckage from Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach),
who has been helping Stelzer in his efforts to get pieces of the
wreckage.</LD>
<LD>   "It was wonderful; I was taken by surprise. I had tears well my
eyes. I didn't know what to say, it's such a wonderful thing that my
great-great-grandchildren can have that can be treasured for life,"
Stelzer, 83, said from his Laguna Woods home. "It makes me feel
wonderful to have a memento to know that my suffering wasn't in
vain."</LD>
<TE>   How the Bim Bam Bola crashed is uncertain. The son of one crew
member now dead says it was shot down as it returned from a mission
to bomb Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Stelzer says the captain ordered the crew to bail out before the
bomber reached Munich; somehow, the plane had become separated from
the rest of its flight. Stelzer parachuted safely but was captured by
Nazis and held as a prisoner of war for nearly a year.</TE>
<TE>   The plane crashed on a hillside near Prattigau in eastern
Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, Stelzer was given two fragments of the B-24 Liberator
bomber's gas valve mounted in finely polished dark wood. The silvery,
foot-long cylindrical pieces were among the wreckage recently
unearthed by the Swiss government.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe he may be the only living survivor of the crash,
because we haven't been able to locate anyone else," said Cox, who
contacted the Swiss and German governments to coordinate efforts.</TE>

<HD>Family Sues CHP Over Crash That Killed Teen</HD>
<DH>Jessica Mohorko died after being struck by a patrol car in
Oxnard in March. The action alleges the agency is blocking
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filing suit Monday against the California Highway Patrol, an Oxnard
family whose 18-year-old daughter was killed by a CHP cruiser claimed
the agency has withheld evidence and skewed its investigation to
favor its officers.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of an Oxnard police chaplain, Jessica Mohorko died
instantly March 23 when a patrol car collided with a car driven by
her boyfriend.</LD>
<LD>   The two had left their senior ball and were going to a restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, for unspecified damages, is the latest legal action
filed jointly by Jessica's parents, Edgar and Marta Mohorko, and her
boyfriend, Christopher Haynes.</TE>
<TE>   Twice they went to court to force the CHP to turn over accident
reports, taped witness interviews, diagrams and other evidence that
could be important to their case.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims that CHP officers Christina and Jack Raughton -- a
married couple who were on patrol together -- overreacted to a minor
violation by an unknown motorist and sped recklessly down Oxnard
Boulevard just after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no evidence of a crime or wrong greater than the one
they created by their high speed," the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Parris, a Lancaster attorney representing the Raughtons,
disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   He said the officers had spotted a speeding driver weaving through
traffic and running a red light -- a motorist, he said, who later
came forth as a witness in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The Raughtons were doing exactly what they were trained to do,"
said Parris, a former CHP captain.</TE>
<TE>   "They were correctly following policy by pursuing a suspected
drunk driver."</TE>
<TE>   Parris said the plaintiffs' attorney, Andrew M. Dawson of Woodland
Hills, "is either inaccurate by choice or not aware of all the
facts."</TE>
<TE>   He disputed Dawson's claim that the Raughtons were not flashing
the appropriate emergency lights before the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson said the officers acknowledged as much in taped interviews
recently released by the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   On those tapes, Jack Raughton, who was driving the patrol car,
estimated he was going 85 mph in a 45-mph zone, Dawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also takes the CHP to task for allowing married couples
to patrol together.</TE>
<TE>   The practice disrupts the chain of command, creating "a situation
where neither partner was in charge," the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   A CHP spokesman declined to comment, citing the pending
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference outside the Ventura County courthouse, Dawson
was flanked by Haynes, his parents and members of the Mohorko family.</TE>
<TE>   "Our life is shattered," said Edgar Mohorko, senior pastor at
Messiah Foursquare Church in Oxnard. "We lost our daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko held back tears as he described Jessica boisterously
coming home from school, greeting the cat, calling her brother
"Chubs" and joshing her dad.</TE>
<TE>   "She was basically the life of the house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Intent on pursuing a law enforcement career after high school, she
was direct and outspoken.</TE>
<TE>   At the dance she attended before the accident, she grabbed a
drunken student's car keys and alerted a teacher, her father said.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, captain of Hueneme High School's football team before he
graduated, said he's had tough times since the accident. With his
left arm held together by a dozen pins and two plates, he no longer
plays football.</TE>
<TE>   A freshman at Cal State Fresno, he is studying health and
nutrition with an eye on becoming a hospital dietitian.</TE>
<TE>   On a chain around his neck, he wears Jessica's gold ring.</TE>
<TE>   The Raughtons also have suffered, said their attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Raughton has returned to work, but her husband still is
out with orthopedic injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder,
Parris said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a terrible, tragic accident," he said. "The Raughtons are
very sorry for the loss to the Mohorkos."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Dawson charged, the CHP's investigation has been nothing
more than "an opportunity to manufacture a defense."</TE>
<TE>   He said investigators interviewed Haynes hours after the accident
as he lay in a hospital bed under medication.</TE>
<TE>   But they did not interview the Raughtons for three days, giving
the couple time, he said, to rehearse their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson also contended that investigators were quizzing witnesses
months after they had given their initial accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The practice is an attempt to build inconsistencies into testimony
that might damage the Raughtons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Edgar Mohorko, said accidents involving CHP officers should not be
investigated by their colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   "They know there was wrongdoing," he said, "that proper safety
procedures weren't being followed."</TE>

<HD>Orange Diocese Cuts Don't Faze Parishes -- Yet</HD>
<DH>Self-sufficiency at the local level insulates churches, but
a moratorium on construction loans will have an effect later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena and Phil Willon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange announced its second
5% budget cut this year, many Catholic parishes said Monday that they
don't expect the financial woes to lead to significant reductions in
their programs.</LD>
<LD>   But after losing more than $14 million in each of back-to-back
years, the diocese will not be granting any new loans to parishes
planning expansions or renovations. Diocesan officials have also
frozen or cut about a dozen administrative positions, and other cuts
may be coming as church leaders look for ways to trim expenses.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts "are obviously going to be difficult. We started out with
a pretty lean budget," said diocesan Chancellor Shirl Giacomi.</LD>
<TE>   At churches around Orange County, many officials said they don't
expect the cutbacks to affect their budgets because most parishes are
self-sufficient and, in fact, help support the diocese by sending in
a portion of collection plate proceeds and other donations.</TE>
<TE>   "The average Joe Catholic will not feel this," said Jan Zimmerman,
business manager at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange. "There could be
delays in capital improvements, but overall, the impact will be
minimal. In the church we sometimes joke we are moving on Vatican
time anyway.... That means slow."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the diocese gave St. Joseph parish in Santa Ana a
$200,000 loan to buy a neighboring house so St. Joseph could one day
expand.</TE>
<TE>   "We do need to expand further, and there's going to be a
moratorium on loans for the time being," said parish financial
manager Elena Schneider. "It won't affect us yet because we are not
ready to go forward. But had we tried to buy the land this year, we
probably would not have been able to."</TE>
<TE>   Father Eamon O'Gorman of St. Catherine of Siena Church in Laguna
Beach said his parish's plans to renovate and retrofit the church to
meet quake building standards may be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be breaking ground next May," O'Gorman said Monday.
"We're keeping a constant eye on the situation. We were told that if
we need a [building] loan, it might not be available."</TE>
<TE>   O'Gorman said his parish sees no need to make significant cuts to
its programs or services. Still, there has been "a little
belt-tightening" because collections at St. Catherine have been down
about $1,500 a month since last year's terrorist attacks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the diocese reported that it lost more than $14 million
for a second straight year, primarily because of losses in the stock
market, a rise in insurance costs, $12 million spent on critical
needs in poor parishes and $3.6 million to settle molestation claims.</TE>
<TE>   They are the first back-to-back losses in the diocese's 27-year
history. Three years ago, it reported a surplus of $21.5 million,
thanks largely to a windfall from stock investments.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown ordered his department
heads to cut expenses by 5%, and now has asked for an additional 5%
cut to their 2002-03 budget. The diocese also imposed a one-year
moratorium on granting new loans to parishes.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese has $10 million in outstanding loans to parishes and
$19 million in loans scheduled for the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've loaned out as much money that we can be fiscally
responsible for," Giacomi said.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese saw imminent problems when its annual budget took
shape in July, she said. Besides the partial job freeze, two
employees have been laid off.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the diocese began communicating electronically with
parishes to save money. As for other cuts, Giacomi said, only
proposals are being floated, with nothing concrete until later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe instead of having two lunch conferences, they will have one
and serve a roll and coffee," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange diocese's losses over the last two years have depleted
nearly two-thirds of available reserves. The diocese does have an
additional $90.6 million in reserves designated for specific
purposes.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market slide lowered the value of the diocesan
investment portfolio from $227 million three years ago to about $182
million by the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   Giacomi said the budget woes in Orange County pale in comparison
to the those of the Archdiocese of L.A., where in September seven
church ministries were suddenly eliminated and 60 workers laid off.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Smith of the Catholic Worker, a community service group
running the largest homeless shelter in Orange County, questions the
financial priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said church officials have been too busy trying to make
money from their investments and have forgotten why parishioners
donated their hard-earned cash in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the buildings are built, and everyone has a seat, then we
have to turn our attention to the plight of the poor," he said. "I
don't understand why we're investing money at all. I would like to
see an investment into filling the bellies of the poor, or in
schools."</TE>

<HD>Lonnie Donegan, 71; His Music Influenced 1960s Rock Bands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scottish musician Lonnie Donegan, who spearheaded the "skiffle" music
craze of the 1950s that inspired John Lennon, Paul McCartney and
scores of other teens to take up the guitar and start their own
bands, died Sunday in Peterborough near Cambridge, England, while on
tour. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   Donegan had suffered heart ailments for 25 years. He underwent
heart surgery in 1992 and again earlier this year. He complained of
back pains shortly before he died.</LD>
<LD>   Donegan was known as "the king of skiffle," a chipper, postwar
precursor to rock 'n' roll combining country, blues, gospel, jazz and
folk music.</LD>
<TE>   A jazzman who loved American roots music, Donegan became an
unlikely pop star when "Rock Island Line" exploded in England about
the same time that Elvis Presley's career was taking off in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Donegan was born Anthony James Donegan in Glasgow and was playing
banjo in Chris Barber's Jazz Band in 1954 when the group recorded
"Rock Island Line."</TE>
<TE>   The song, an old folk tune long associated with American
folk-blues singer Leadbelly, featured Donegan's kinetic, clipped
vocals and energetically strummed guitar over a churning,
relentlessly accelerating rhythm that gave British teens their first
taste of what would soon evolve into the beat of rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the first person we had heard of from Britain to get to
the coveted No. 1 in the charts," McCartney said. "And we studied his
records avidly. We all bought guitars to be in a skiffle group. He
was the man."</TE>
<TE>   "Rock Island Line," which reached No. 8 in the U.S. in 1956, was
one of just three of Donegan's many British hits whose popularity
crossed the Atlantic. His biggest U.S. success was the jaunty novelty
song "Does Your Chewing Gum Lose It's [sic] Flavor (On the Bedpost
Over Night)," which reached No. 5 in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   The irony of Donegan's influence on the Beatles, the Rolling
Stones, the Who and other British bands of the 1960s was that their
music quickly relegated his comparatively quaint style to the pop
junk heap.</TE>
<TE>   He continued as a performer and songwriter -- he wrote Tom Jones'
1969 hit "I'll Never Fall In Love Again" -- and toured when his
health was good.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '70s, he was saluted by many of the British rockers he
had inspired with a tribute album, "Putting on the Style," for which
he was backed by a band including Elton John, Ringo Starr, Queen
guitarist Brian May and Rolling Stones guitarist Ron Wood. In 1999
and 2000, he collaborated and toured with Van Morrison.</TE>
<TE>   Donegan was made Member of the British Empire in 2000 for his
cultural contributions. He said his big accomplishment was helping to
make folk music popular again.</TE>
<TE>   "In England," he told the Newcastle Journal earlier this year, "we
were separated from our folk music tradition centuries ago and were
imbued with the idea that music was for the upper classes. You had to
be very clever to play music. When I came along with the old three
chords, people began to think that if I could do it, so could they.
It was the reintroduction of the folk music bridge which did that."</TE>
<TE>   Donegan had been living in recent years in Malaga, Spain, with his
third wife, Sharon, and their three sons, Peter, David and Andrew. He
also is survived by four children from his two previous marriages.</TE>
<TE>   A private funeral will be followed by a public memorial. No dates
have been announced.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Melodyland Christian Center has filed a lawsuit against the owners of
the Grove of Anaheim in an attempt to block the sale of the
1,100-seat theater to the city.</LD>
<LD>   Over objections from Melodyland, the Anaheim City Council recently
approved the $6.7-million purchase of the Grove, located in the
city's sports and entertainment district near the Arrowhead Pond and
Edison International Field.</LD>
<LD>   The city is buying the theater from SMG, a company that manages
arenas and stadiums, and expects escrow to close in several days.</LD>
<TE>   Under the agreement with SMG, the city retained the first right of
offer if the Grove should ever be sold. Melodyland had approached SMG
with a $6.7-million offer to buy the theater.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit filed last week in Orange County Superior Court,
Melodyland is alleging breach of contract, fraud and negligent
misrepresentation and breach of good faith and fair dealing.</TE>

<HD>Jonathan Harris, 87; Bumbling Villain in TV's 'Lost in
Space'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, the pain, the pain!</LD>
<LD>   -- Dr. Zachary Smith</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Jonathan Harris, the dastardly, villainous, yet endearing Dr.
Zachary Smith, who sabotaged the spaceship Jupiter II in 1965,
causing the hapless Robinson family and inadvertently himself to be
forever "Lost in Space" on prime-time television, has died. He was
87.</TE>
<TE>   Harris died Sunday at Encino Medical Center of a blood clot that
reached his heart after he was hospitalized for an unrelated illness,
said Kevin J. Burns, spokesman for Fox Television Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Lost in Space" -- producer Irwin Allen's futuristic take
for CBS on "The Swiss Family Robinson" -- ran only from 1965 to 1968,
it became an international cult favorite and is still replayed on
cable channels and is available on video. Crammed with campy aliens
and corny dialogue, the series predated "Star Trek" and remains a
familiar delight to its fans.</TE>
<TE>   Set in 1997, the series left the exploring family -- and Smith --
still trying to find their way back to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Harris reprised the smarmy Smith in a one-hour television
special, "Lost in Space Forever." At the time of his death, he was
working on a new television movie for NBC -- "Lost in Space: The
Journey Home" -- that finally might bring the Robinsons back.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike others in the television cast, however, Harris rejected a
cameo in the 1998 motion picture version of "Lost in Space" starring
Gary Oldman as Smith. The actor reasoned that, if he could not play
his character, he wanted nothing to do with the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Harris' plummy villain did not appear in the series pilot, which
was not telecast. But when CBS decided that the show needed a bad
guy, Allen, who would go on to create disaster films like "The
Towering Inferno," considered such actors as Carroll O'Connor and
Eddie Albert before settling on Harris. Harris had worked with the
star, Guy Williams, in Williams' earlier television series, "Zorro."</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take Harris long to steal the show from the rest of the
cast -- Williams, June Lockhart, Mark Goddard, three kids and Robot,
patterned after Robby the Robot of the film "Forbidden Planet."</TE>
<TE>   "I realized that the original concept of Smith was a deep-dyed,
snarling villain, and he bored me to death," Harris said in 1998,
explaining how he developed the character. "There's no longevity in a
part like that. They'd have to kill me off in five episodes, and I'd
be out of a job, unemployed again, right? So I began to sneak in the
things for which I am -- at the risk of seeming immodest -- justly
famous. Comedic villainy."</TE>
<TE>   Grudgingly, Allen was forced to give Harris carte blanche to do
what he wanted -- because the improvisations worked.</TE>
<TE>   Pompous and verbose, Harris' Smith became well-known for certain
catch-phrases. He had his own names for Robot, such as "you bumbling
bag of bolts" or "you primitive pile of pistons." In addition to his
insulting references to Robot and his deadpan "Oh, the pain, the
pain," there were "you bubble-headed booby," "you Neanderthal
ninnies" and the oft-quoted "Never fear, Smith is here."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the Smith character contracted with foreign enemies to
sabotage the spaceship's control panel, ruining the Robinsons'
planned five-year exploratory trip to a planet in the Alpha Centauri
star system. But telegraphing his series-long perpetual bumbling,
Smith trapped himself aboard as well. When the Jupiter II
crash-landed, Smith had to make an uneasy truce with those he had
sought to maroon.</TE>
<TE>   The curmudgeon, whose doctorate supposedly was in "intergalactic
environmental psychology," was always trying to make deals with
extra-terrestrial life forms to return him -- but not the Robinsons
or Robot or their pilot -- to Earth. He would sell parts of Robot or,
when threatened, shove the littlest Robinson forward and say "Take
the boy! Take the boy!" What made Smith as likable as he was inept,
however, was that he would redeem himself by recovering the piece of
metal or the boy.</TE>
<TE>   Creating the character that made him an international caricature,
Harris said on CBS' "The Early Show" earlier this year, was "the most
fun in the whole world. I loved creating ... that dreadful, wonderful
man."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Harris always considered his favorite television
role that of Bradford Webster, assistant to Michael Rennie's Harry
Lime in the television version of "The Third Man," which ran in
syndication from 1959 to 1962.</TE>
<TE>   Born Jonathan Charasuchin in the Bronx to poor Russian- Jewish
immigrants, Harris began working as a box boy in a pharmacy at age
12. Later, changing his surname to one more easily pronounced by
Americans, he earned a pharmacy degree at Fordham University and
worked as a pharmacist.</TE>
<TE>   But he wanted to act and taught himself elocution to shake his
Bronx accent. He began working in repertory at the Millpond Playhouse
in Roslyn, Long Island, and within three years had been in 125 plays
in stock companies across the country. With that background, he made
his Broadway debut in 1942, starring in Gilbert Miller's production
of "Heart of a City."</TE>
<TE>   Harris entertained troops in the South Pacific during World War
II, and then did several more Broadway plays. As early as 1948, he
added live early television drama shows. Moving to Hollywood in 1953,
he made his film debut in "Botany Bay" with Alan Ladd and James
Mason.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to dramatic classic television series like "Studio
One" and "General Electric Theater," Harris worked frequently in such
popular series as "The Twilight Zone," "Outlaws" and "Bewitched."</TE>
<TE>   After his signature experience with "Lost in Space," Harris
switched to voice-overs for commercials and children's animated
series, such as "Freakazoid." He was the voice of Manny the Preying
Mantis in the animated motion picture "A Bug's Life" and the voice of
The Fixer in "Toy Story II."</TE>
<TE>   Harris is survived by his wife of 64 years, Gertrude; his son,
Richard; two sisters, Rosalie and Allene, and two granddaughters.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be at 10 a.m. Wednesday, which would have been
Harris' 88th birthday, at Westwood Memorial Park in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Oak Park School Trustee Dies on Eve of Bid for 4th Term</HD>
<DH>Bob Kahn, an advocate for students and staff, worked to
develop arts and athletics programs. He is described as a 'real
unsung hero.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oak Park schools trustee Bob Kahn died of complications from diabetes
Monday, the day before he had hoped to be elected to a fourth term on
the school board.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Marilyn Lippiatt described Kahn, 73, as a tireless advocate
for students and staff who worked to develop quality arts and
athletic programs in the Oak Park Unified School District. The
affluent district of 3,700 students consistently earns top scores
statewide on student achievement tests.</LD>
<LD>   Kahn's involvement with local educational issues began in 1978
when the district was created, Lippiatt said. He was first elected to
the board in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   "As a board member, Bob supported students, staff and programs,"
Lippiatt said. "He had special interest in both the arts and
athletics and was a vocal advocate for both. Bob's contributions were
many, and his voice, comments and sense of history will be missed."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo, who represents
unincorporated Oak Park on the Board of Supervisors, said Kahn was
active in getting a new public library built on the Oak Park High
School campus.</TE>
<TE>   "He was outspoken about the need for a public library in Oak
Park," said Schillo, adding that Kahn will be remembered at today's
supervisors meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real unsung hero for the service he's provided," Schillo
said. "You very seldom get any praise for what you do, and all you
hear is complaints from parents about what you did or what you should
have done."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn's public interest extended beyond education. He often
attended Municipal Advisory Council meetings to learn more about
other issues affecting his community, Schillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing school board member Linda Seaman said Kahn, a retired
insurance sales manager, was helpful to her when she joined the board
six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He was good at explaining the history behind a decision and why
it was done that way," said Seaman.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn's name will appear on today's ballot alongside five other
candidates running for three open seats on the board. Should Kahn be
among the top three vote-getters, the Oak Park school board could
appoint someone to fill his seat for two years until the next general
election or hold a special election in March or June.</TE>
<TE>   A special election would cost the district $15,000, said county

<HD>Teen Charged in Beating Deaths of Neighbors</HD>
<DH>Santa Paula youth is accused of bludgeoning and stabbing
the couple in their bed, possibly because he coveted their Chevy
Monte Carlo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old Santa Paula boy suspected of beating a neighborhood
couple to death in their bed was charged Monday with first-degree
murder, burglary and robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Sarabia, a continuation school student who lives with his
parents near the couple's home, is accused of using a baseball bat
and a knife during the killings.</LD>
<LD>   Despite his age, Sarabia will be tried as an adult, prosecutors
said, because of the circumstances of the crime and the brutal nature
of the double homicide.</LD>
<TE>   John Ramirez Jr., 59, and Joann Wotkyns, 55, were found dead in
their upscale Santa Paula home on Oct. 21. Blood was splattered
throughout the bedroom, and autopsies determined they were bludgeoned
in the head.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia, who was arrested Friday, is also charged with joy-riding
in the couple's Special Edition 2001 Chevy Monte Carlo. Police
believe the boy coveted the car and killed the couple for it.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia also faces three special-circumstance allegations,
involving multiple murders committed during a robbery and burglary.</TE>
<TE>   Those allegations would make an adult defendant subject to the
death penalty. When a juvenile is involved, state law requires
prosecutors to file charges in adult court.</TE>
<TE>   "When a minor commits a murder that might get an adult the death
penalty, then the district attorney gets no discretion," Deputy Dist.
Atty. John C. West said. "We have to file in adult court."</TE>
<TE>   The rule was enacted two years ago when voters approved a
statewide crime initiative, Proposition 21.</TE>
<TE>   Sarabia, whose name was released by authorities after he was
charged as an adult, is expected to be arraigned on the charges this
afternoon in Ventura County Superior Court. He remains at a juvenile
detention center in Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on the charges, he could face life in prison without
possibility of parole. Sarabia's defense attorney could not be
reached for comment Monday evening.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the boy after investigators raided his parents'
house -- just a few blocks from the victims' home -- and discovered
evidence linking him to the killings, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not determined a motive besides the boy's
possible desire to possess the couple's car, which was found
abandoned in a nearby Kmart parking lot after the bodies were found.</TE>
<TE>   Wotkyns' purse and wallet were found in the home after the
slaying, but her car keys were missing, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told investigators they saw the youth driving the Chevy
in Santa Paula and Ventura the day after the slayings. The car was
also spotted at a mobile home park near Sarabia's house, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Paula Police Chief Bob Gonzales said investigators believe
they can link the youth to the slayings through DNA evidence, but the
tests will not be completed for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   Two other Santa Paula teenagers, described by authorities as
friends of the suspect, were questioned last week and one was
arrested on an unrelated drug charge.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities described the teens as witnesses, not possible
suspects.</TE>

<HD>Richard Rocco, 63; Ex-Barrio Gang Member Won Medal of Honor
for His Heroics in Vietnam War</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dennis McLellan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Rocco, a onetime Wilmington barrio gang member who received
the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War for rescuing three fellow
crew members from a burning helicopter, has died. He was 63.</LD>
<LD>   Rocco, who later served as an advocate for his native New Mexico's
veterans and more recently promoted an anti-drug program sponsored by
Vietnam Veterans of America, died Thursday of lung cancer at his home
in San Antonio. The disease was diagnosed in January.</LD>
<LD>   Then-Sgt. 1st Class Rocco, a medic, was on his second tour of duty
in Vietnam on May 24, 1970, when he volunteered to accompany a
medical evacuation team on an urgent mission to pick up eight
critically wounded South Vietnamese soldiers near the village of
Katum.</LD>
<TE>   As the helicopter Rocco was riding in neared the landing zone, it
came under heavy enemy fire. The pilot was shot in the leg; the
helicopter crashed into a field. Rocco suffered a fractured wrist and
hip, and a severely bruised back.</TE>
<TE>   But he ignored his injuries and the intense enemy fire to pull
three unconscious crew members from the burning chopper. Suffering
burns to his hands in the process, he carried each man across about
20 yards of exposed terrain. He then helped administer first aid to
them before he lost consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Rocco and the other crewmen were rescued the next day. Lt. Lee
Caubareaux, the helicopter's co-pilot whose shattered arm was saved
by doctors, later lobbied for Rocco to receive the Medal of Honor. If
not for Rocco, Caubareaux later said, he and the other crewmen would
have burned to death.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 12, 1974, President Ford presented the Medal of Honor to
Rocco, the only New Mexican to receive the nation's highest award for
valor during the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody -- nobody -- would have faulted him when he got out to
safety if he had stayed there," retired Army Lt. Gen. Ed Baca said
three weeks ago at a ceremony in Albuquerque honoring Rocco. "But,
instead, he charged into that helicopter."</TE>
<TE>   "You really don't get a chance to think about what you are doing,"
Rocco said at that ceremony. "You want to save lives and live too. I
was lucky; I was able to do that. God looked after me."</TE>
<TE>   A native of the Albuquerque suburb of Barelas, Louis Richard Rocco
was the oldest son in a poor Italian-Latino family. With his father
frequently unemployed, Rocco later recalled, he stole potatoes and
corn from neighbors' fields to help feed his parents and eight
siblings.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 10, the family moved to a housing project in the San
Fernando Valley and later to Wilmington. By 13, Rocco was getting
into trouble with the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent most of my teenage years in jail," he told the
Albuquerque Tribune last month. "At 16  1/2, they were getting ready
to send me up until I was 21."</TE>
<TE>   While waiting to be sentenced for armed robbery, Rocco wandered
into a Los Angeles Army recruiting station, where he told his
problems to the recruiter.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first time an adult in my life didn't judge me,"
Rocco recalled. "He just listened, actively listened. And it was the
first time that I spilled my guts. All the pain and anger inside me
came out."</TE>
<TE>   The recruiter spoke to the judge, and they agreed that Rocco would
spend a year in a delinquency home and then his parents would sign a
waiver, allowing him to join the Army.</TE>
<TE>   The recruiter, Rocco told The Times last year, "saved my life, got
me out of the gangs, got me out of the barrios."</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, after 22 years of military service, Rocco retired from
the Army as a chief warrant officer.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a leader and role model for other Vietnam veterans,
Rocco established the Vietnam Veterans of New Mexico; opened a Vet
Center, which provided peer counseling to Vietnam veterans; and
became director of New Mexico's Veterans Service Commission.</TE>
<TE>   He also started a shelter for the homeless and a nursing home for
veterans, and persuaded New Mexico legislators and voters to let all
veterans into state colleges free.</TE>
<TE>   During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, he returned to active duty
at Ft. Sam Houston, Texas, where he recruited medical personnel.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he was instrumental in promoting Veterans Against
Drugs, a growing nationwide program in the schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The legacy I would like to have left is that these kids would
have values of honesty, integrity, patriotism, loyalty and
compassion," Rocco said. "They're growing up with no thought as to
which direction they're going."</TE>
<TE>   Rocco is survived by his wife, Maria; two sons, Roy of Simi Valley
and Brian of San Diego; one daughter, Theresa DuBois of Carson City,
Nev.; his mother, Lita Rocco of Hemet; a brother, Clyde of San
Antonio; four sisters, Sandra Schmidt and Gayle Rocco, both of Hemet,
Mary Rocco of San Jacinto, and Diane Calderon of Las Vegas; and five
grandchildren.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven Orange County cities will get a total of $1.9 million in
federal funds to improve safety along the routes to 37 public and
private schools.</LD>
<LD>   The money is part of $22 million being spent statewide to support
87 projects, including striping streets and installing pavement
markers, pedestrian rail crossings and crosswalk lights.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County money will be used for seven schools in Buena
Park, 14 in Garden Grove, three each in La Habra and Laguna Beach,
seven in Santa Ana, one in Stanton and two in Tustin.</LD>
<TE>   Also, the state released $7.2 million for 23 bicycle-related
projects, an annual stipend that will run through 2006. The only
money Orange County received was $750,000 toward the $2.5-million
cost for a bicycle bridge over Jeffrey Road at the San Diego Freeway
in Irvine.</TE>

<HD>Costa Mesa Is Growing Up</HD>
<DH>In the next few years, two skyscrapers will join the area
skyline. But demand for office space may ensure they aren't the
city's last.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It might not seem like much of a skyline to those partial to the
towering masterpieces of New York and Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   But the subtle, sharp and slightly futuristic buildings near South
Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa belong to what planners call one of the
country's most sought-after office environments. They offer a dose of
urban sophistication, without being too urban.</LD>
<LD>   That skyline is about to change. Two sleek suburban skyscrapers
worthy of an appearance in the science-fiction thriller "Minority
Report" are planned to rise from the sprawl in the next few years.
They are the last two such buildings that can be built in the area
under Costa Mesa's general plan.</LD>
<TE>   Across Bristol Street from the mall is a popular location because
executives get the prestige of being in a "skyscraper" -- though the
tallest is just 21 stories high -- without having to ride public
transportation or set foot on a sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Planners nationwide say the towers have helped make the business
district from John Wayne Airport to South Coast Plaza the country's
largest "edge city" -- a designation that applies to bustling centers
of the office economy that have been sprouting in U.S. suburbs over
the last few decades. In some cases, edge cities have attracted more
business than the nation's major urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   The last time ground was broken on one of Costa Mesa's towering
monuments was in the early 1990s. A slumping commercial real estate
market in the decade that followed encouraged developers to shift
toward more efficient low-rises.</TE>
<TE>   Today, because land is increasingly scarce and expensive, the only
way to go is up.</TE>
<TE>   The next skyscraper will likely be the 18-story tower that
Commonwealth Partners plans to build at Anton Boulevard and Bristol
Street. The plans, approved by city officials in October, call for a
modern tower that will add 400,000 square feet of office space to the
area, along with a five-story garage. Work is scheduled to start in
the coming months, beginning with the demolition of an Edwards movie
theater at the site.</TE>
<TE>   A block up Bristol, where the street meets Sunflower Avenue, C.J.
Segerstrom &amp; Sons plans to demolish the Sumitomo Bank to build a
21-story tower. The blueprints for that project are not complete, but
company officials say they have hired the firm of modernist architect
Helmut Jahn to draft them.</TE>
<TE>   Jahn is known for his eclectic, futuristic style. Among his works
are Kemper Arena in Kansas City, built with an exoskeleton of giant
trusses, and the Sony Center in Berlin, which is covered by a "crown"
of steel cable, fiberglass membrane and glass. A recent article in
Architecture Week described Jahn as pushing "the limits of glazing
technology, environmental systems and urban place-making."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growth Was a Surprise</TE>
<TE>   It's not only real-estate executives who are buzzing about the
plans for the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Academics are taking note, too.</TE>
<TE>   "You have as much office space in and around Costa Mesa now as you
do in downtown Dallas or Atlanta," said Robert Lang, author of
"Edgeless Cities: Exploring the Elusive Metropolis," to be released
in January by Brookings Institution Press. "This place did not begin
as a big city, but there were seeds planted as [South Coast Plaza]
got built in the 1960s and 1970s, and its growth caught everyone by
surprise."</TE>
<TE>   The South Coast Metro area of Costa Mesa and nearby high-rises
around John Wayne Airport dwarf the much larger and more urban cities
such as Anaheim and Santa Ana when it comes to office space. It
actually makes up the biggest edge city in the country, according to
Lang's research.</TE>
<TE>   But why Costa Mesa?</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts say it started with executives living along the
coast and in other tony neighborhoods looking to open offices in the
county to reduce their commutes. That was about the time that South
Coast Plaza was being built, and developers of the mall zoned large
parcels nearby for business parks.</TE>
<TE>   "They couldn't afford to have honky-tonk versions of their mall
sprout around them while they are trying to sell space to places like
Nordstrom, so they cleared the space around them for offices," Lang
said.</TE>
<TE>   Segerstrom then opted to invest in top-of-the-line high-rise
construction for that space, including dining clubs, spas and
penthouse office suites with expansive views toward the ocean. They
were luxuries few other Orange County cities were providing.</TE>
<TE>   Top firms seeking a prestigious location eagerly signed leases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way Century City used to be," said Alfred Gobar, an
Orange County real estate economist. "You've got a lot of nice
restaurants. All the other prestigious guys are nearby. And everybody
drives Porsches.</TE>
<TE>   "You can say I'm in the big building with whatever," he said.
"It's great for the egos of these guys."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Costs Push Up Rents</TE>
<TE>   Gobar himself is not a big fan of high-rises. He says the cost of
putting in parking structures, elevators and all the associated
engineering with building up forces rents to rise significantly.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a hard time working through the economics of these
things," he said. "But I guess it's like when Warren Buffet said he
would never buy stock in a company with a corporate jet. Then he flew

<TE>   Although a South Coast Metro high-rise address offers prestige to
a firm hoping to locate near John Wayne Airport, it still doesn't
compare to setting up shop near the ocean breezes at Fashion Island
in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Fashion Island is the creme de la creme," said Steve Lane, an
Irvine-based vice president of Voit Commercial Brokerage. "It is just
a fabulous place to work. There is no finer place to be from an
employee standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   Yet a voter backlash against large projects in Newport Beach makes
any significant future development uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   That has planners looking to Costa Mesa. Even though the city's
general plan allows for only two more high-rises, building industry
consultants say that could change.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Gollis, chairman of the Orange County chapter of the Urban
Land Institute, says the sprawling asphalt parking lots around South
Coast Plaza take up dozens of acres of prime real estate that is ripe
for better use.</TE>
<TE>   Parking could be compacted with multilevel garages, he said, and
the rest of the space could be used for more buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point there will be economic value to converting that
land to the highest and best use," he said. "I think there will be
high-rise development there."</TE>

<HD>Farm Town Sends Out SOS</HD>
<DH>Save Our Somis group fears widening a state highway will
disrupt the rural lifestyle. Judge will decide if more study is
needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Residents of the Ventura County farm town of Somis say they want to
maintain the rural atmosphere of one of Southern California's last
undeveloped agricultural valleys.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans says it wants to improve and expand an unsafe and
overcrowded intersection where two highways meet in the tiny hamlet
near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   The debate brought both sides Monday to Ventura County Superior
Court, where Judge Henry J. Walsh said he will soon decide whether
Caltrans must review the proposal's environmental effects before it
can expand the intersection at state highways 34 and 118.</LD>
<TE>   About 80 members of the group Save Our Somis attended the hearing,
saying the future of the Las Posas Valley is at stake. Except for the
Ventura Freeway, California 118 is the only main traffic artery
connecting the east county to the west. It also serves as a popular
alternate route for truckers and commuters.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans attorney William Evans told Walsh that the widening
project, which is scheduled to begin in 2005, isn't large enough to
warrant an expensive and time-consuming environmental study.</TE>
<TE>   "From a state perspective, this is a small project with a limited
impact on the environment," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said construction costs on Caltrans projects tend to rise
about 8% to 10% a year. The work in Somis is projected to cost $4
million, barring delays.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Save Our Somis, whose members agree the intersection
needs improvement to ease severe congestion, said Caltrans' proposal
would require crews to cut down 38 eucalyptus trees that provide a
winter home for monarch butterflies and would affect a quarter-acre
of wetlands near the intersection.</TE>
<TE>   "These people aren't against a project to fix the intersection,"
Save Our Somis attorney Rachel Hooper said outside the courtroom.
"They're saying, 'Let's do it in a proper way so the impacts are
studied.' "</TE>
<TE>   Members of Save Our Somis say the Caltrans proposal is part of a
larger plan to turn California 118 into a four-lane highway
stretching from the Port of Hueneme to Moorpark. They fear a widened
118 would invite more development and heavy truck traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want that connection to come through and destroy our
little town," said Somis resident Barbara Kerkhoff, who attended the
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Save Our Somis has raised about $100,000 to fight the Caltrans
proposal, including hiring Hooper and paying a private engineer to
develop an alternate proposal.</TE>

<LD>A Ventura resident was arrested Monday for allegedly brandishing a
knife at a police officer, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Michael Moss, 48, is accused of pulling a knife on Ventura Officer
Mark Cleavenger, who had stopped Moss on suspicion of violating a
restraining order, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Moss, standing near a service station at Telephone and Kimball
roads, reportedly told officers, "This time you are going to have to
shoot me."</LD>
<TE>   As Moss advanced on Cleavenger, the officer backed away, drew his
gun and sprayed Moss with pepper spray, police said. The pepper spray
hit Moss near his chin and had no effect, but he surrendered minutes
later when more police units arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Moss was taken to Ventura County Medical Center then booked at the
Ventura County Jail.</TE>

<HD>W. Grimsley, 88; Sports Reporter, Columnist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Grimsley, who covered the spectrum of sports for four decades as
a reporter, columnist and special correspondent for the Associated
Press, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   Grimsley, who retired in 1984, died Thursday of heart failure in
East Meadow, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   Grimsley's byline was one of the best known in sports as he
reported for nearly half a century from the world's biggest athletic
events, including 15 Olympics, 35 World Series and 25 Kentucky
Derbies.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Monterey, Tenn., Grimsley joined the sports staff of the
Evening Tennessean at 18 and became sports editor and columnist for
the paper in 1935. Grimsley was hired by the Associated Press at
Memphis in 1943 and was transferred to New York as a sports writer in
1947.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, he was named a special correspondent, one of a handful of
Associated Press writers and the only one in sports to carry that
title.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, in 1977, "Grimsley's Sports World" made its
debut as a five-day-a-week column that gave afternoon newspapers a
versatile look at the world Grimsley occupied. Sometimes it was a
mood piece, sometimes it was analytical and sometimes it was a
profile of a sports personality. Grimsley specialized in golf,
tennis, college football and the Olympics, and he regularly covered
the Indianapolis 500, the Super Bowl, the Masters and Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include a daughter, Nellie B. Grimsley; and a son,
William Kelly Grimsley.</TE>

<HD>2 Lancaster Prison Guards Are Attacked</HD>
<DH>One officer is injured in the assault by two cellmates.
Officials believe the motive was the suspension of some inmate
privileges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in three months, guards at the state prison in
Lancaster were attacked by inmates in what appears to be an
orchestrated protest against the rollback of their privileges,
officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Correctional officers Nicole Hawthorne and Henry Romo were
attacked by two cellmates early Saturday while escorting prisoners to
breakfast, prison spokesman Lt. Ron Nipper said. Other guards quickly
broke up the fight, with one firing wooden bullets at the inmates.</LD>
<LD>   Hawthorne was sent to Antelope Valley Hospital with blurred
vision, a hematoma to the right eye and lacerations to the head. The
three-year veteran was treated and released, and was expected to
fully recover. Romo was not injured.</LD>
<TE>   The suspects, Aaron Washington, 47, and Sharifu Washington, 30,
suffered minor injuries. They were transferred to a state prison in
Tehachapi.</TE>
<TE>   Prison officials were unsure if the two are related. Both are
serving life sentences for first-degree murder. Officials said they
could face prosecution for the assaults.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators suspect the cellmates may have been lashing out over
the loss of inmate privileges and a tightening of the rules at Los
Angeles County's only maximum-security lockup. In recent years, state
officials have removed weights from prison yards, set strict new
grooming and dress policies and banned overnight visits for some
convicts. This year, they introduced a ban on pornographic magazines
and other publications that depict nudity.</TE>
<TE>   Nipper said Lancaster officials angered some prisoners with
stricter enforcement of these and other rules after a riot in
December involving 300 inmates. The crackdown is now believed to be
what motivated Crips gang members to attack three Lancaster prison
guards Aug. 12, Nipper said.</TE>
<TE>   One officer was stabbed in the head and another suffered a
fractured jaw. Prison officials responded to the August attack with a
sweeping investigation that led to the confiscation of 70 weapons and
charges against more than 15 inmates for planning or taking part in
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Nipper said the suspects in Saturday's attack may have "slipped
through the cracks" in that investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Sharifu Washington, he said, is a member of the Crips. Aaron
Washington, Nipper said, is a member of the Black Guerrilla Family,
an African American prison gang that advocates the overthrow of the
government, according to the Anti-Defamation League.</TE>
<TE>   The Lancaster facility is home to some of California's most
violent felons. And like many California state prisons, it is
severely overcrowded. Built in 1993 for 2,200 inmates, it now houses
about 4,000.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the tension is a lockdown that has been in effect since
the December riot. Prisoners lose many privileges in a lockdown, and
are rarely allowed to leave their cells.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent attack, Nipper said, "is going to be a big setback
for the institution. We're trying to work our way back to a normal
program."</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, inmate assaults on prison guards and staffers have
nearly tripled in the last decade. There were 933 assaults in 1991,
compared with 2,768 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Assaults at Lancaster have risen as well. The prison had 116
assaults in 2001, state prison officials said, but that is still
considerably less than the 334 assaults that year at the
maximum-security lockup at Pelican Bay, which has about 1,000 fewer
inmates than Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   Assaults are on the rise because the three-strikes law and other
get-tough measures have put away many violent offenders with little
chance of release, said Russ Heimerich, spokesman for the Corrections
Department. Often, he said, prisoners feel they have little to lose.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're in for life without parole, what can they do to you
except tack on another life sentence?" Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   Because inmates have so little to look forward to, advocates
believe the state is wrong to curtail their privileges and impose
more restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Driscoll, a Woodland Hills salesman whose son has been an
inmate at Lancaster for three years, thinks this fosters a more
dangerous atmosphere for guards.</TE>
<TE>   "How could it not?" Driscoll said. "They've had everything taken
away from them. It's ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Lance Corcoran, a spokesman for the prison guards' union, said
many of the new regulations were a response to the concerns of prison
employees.</TE>
<TE>   They complained that prison weight rooms were allowing inmates to
bulk up to intimidating sizes, and pornography was being waved in the
faces of female officers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was because some people couldn't control themselves that they
had to implement these regulations in the first place," he said.</TE>

<HD>Remains Are Identified as Man Missing 41/2 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Skeletal remains found in a remote part of Joshua Tree National Park
in San Bernardino County were identified Monday as those of Joseph
Dimento, 60, a Seal Beach man who disappeared more than four years
ago.</LD>
<LD>   "I was stunned," said his wife, Uraiwan. "I always thought he was
alive somewhere doing volunteer work."</LD>
<LD>   She reported him missing in June 1998, a week after she said the
couple returned from a camping trip in Joshua Tree. She told Seal
Beach police at the time that on the way home, they'd had an argument
and he had left angrily with only his driver's license and $200 after
dropping her off at the house.</LD>
<TE>   She waited to report him missing, she said, because she knew him
to be moody and thought he was staying with friends. But several days
later, she said, she found his wallet -- with credit and ATM cards
inside -- in the bushes in front of their house and called police.</TE>
<TE>   Seventeen months after the disappearance, Seal Beach Police Det.
Darrell Hardin, who'd been investigating the case, said he thought
the retired IBM repairman -- whose wife had put up a $100,000 reward
for information leading to his return -- was eking out an existence
somewhere under a different name. "It's easy to get false
identification," Hardin said.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 28, however, a troop of Boy Scouts practicing land
navigation found the remains; Monday, the San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Department announced that the body had been identified
through dental records as that of the missing man.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time it's not known how he came to be in the park and
what led up to his death," said Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for the
San Bernardino Sheriff's Department. "We don't know if it was
homicide, suicide or accidental. We are waiting for the coroner's
office to determine the cause of death."</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed by telephone Monday, Uraiwan Dimento, 62, suggested
several scenarios that could have led to her husband's death,
including murder, suicide and accidental exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "Any survival class will tell you not to go to Joshua Tree without
any [equipment]; in one or two nights the environment will kill you,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, she added, had been depressed for several months due
to pain in his heel.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel sad that he could have had another 10 to 15 years of a
good life," she said. "Maybe you hang on to unrealistic things.
Everybody around me told me he might be dead, but I chose to believe
what I wanted to believe."</TE>

<HD>Teen's Family Files Lawsuit Against CHP in Fatal Crash</HD>
<DH>Jessica Mohorko died after being struck by a patrol car in
Oxnard in March. The action alleges the agency is blocking
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Filing suit Monday against the California Highway Patrol, an Oxnard
family whose 18-year-old daughter was killed by a CHP cruiser claimed
the agency has withheld evidence and skewed its investigation to
favor its officers.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of an Oxnard police chaplain, Jessica Mohorko died
instantly March 23 when a patrol car collided with a car driven by
her boyfriend.</LD>
<LD>   The two had left their senior ball and were going to a restaurant.</LD>
<TE>   The suit, for unspecified damages, is the latest legal action
filed jointly by Jessica's parents, Edgar and Marta Mohorko, and her
boyfriend, Christopher Haynes.</TE>
<TE>   Twice they went to court to force the CHP to turn over accident
reports, taped witness interviews, diagrams and other evidence that
could be important to their case.</TE>
<TE>   The suit claims that CHP officers Christina and Jack Raughton -- a
married couple who were on patrol together -- overreacted to a minor
violation by an unknown motorist and sped recklessly down Oxnard
Boulevard just after midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no evidence of a crime or wrong greater than the one
they created by their high speed," the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   Robert A. Parris, a Lancaster attorney representing the Raughtons,
disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   He said the officers had spotted a speeding driver weaving through
traffic and running a red light -- a motorist, he said, who later
came forth as a witness in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The Raughtons were doing exactly what they were trained to do,"
said Parris, a former CHP captain. "They were correctly following
policy by pursuing a suspected drunk driver."</TE>
<TE>   Parris said the plaintiffs' attorney, Andrew M. Dawson of Woodland
Hills, "is either inaccurate by choice or not aware of all the
facts."</TE>
<TE>   He disputed Dawson's claim that the Raughtons were not flashing
the appropriate emergency lights before the crash. Dawson said the
officers acknowledged as much in taped interviews recently released
by the CHP.</TE>
<TE>   On those tapes, Jack Raughton, who was driving the patrol car,
estimated he was going 85 mph in a 45-mph zone, Dawson said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also takes the CHP to task for allowing married couples
to patrol together.</TE>
<TE>   The practice disrupts the chain of command, creating "a situation
where neither partner was in charge," the suit said.</TE>
<TE>   A CHP spokesman declined comment, citing the pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference outside the Ventura County courthouse, Dawson
was flanked by Haynes, his parents and members of the Mohorko family.</TE>
<TE>   "Our life is shattered," said Edgar Mohorko, senior pastor at
Messiah Foursquare Church in Oxnard. "We lost our daughter."</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko held back tears as he described Jessica boisterously
coming home from school, greeting the cat, calling her brother
"Chubs," and joshing her dad.</TE>
<TE>   "She was basically the life of the house," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Intent on pursuing a law enforcement career after high school, she
was direct and outspoken.</TE>
<TE>   At the dance she attended before the accident, she grabbed a
drunken student's car keys and alerted a teacher, her father said.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, captain of Hueneme High School's football team before he
graduated, said he's had tough times since the accident. With his
left arm held together by a dozen pins and two plates, he no longer
plays football.</TE>
<TE>   A freshman at Cal State Fresno, he is studying health and
nutrition with an eye on becoming a hospital dietitian.</TE>
<TE>   On a chain around his neck, he wears Jessica's gold ring.</TE>
<TE>   The Raughtons also have suffered, said their attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Christina Raughton has returned to work, but her husband still is
out with orthopedic injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder,
Parris said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a terrible, tragic accident," he said. "The Raughtons are
very sorry for the loss to the Mohorkos."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Dawson charged, the CHP's investigation has been nothing
more than "an opportunity to manufacture a defense."</TE>
<TE>   He said investigators interviewed Haynes hours after the accident
as he lay in a hospital bed under medication.</TE>
<TE>   But they did not interview the Raughtons for three days, giving
the couple time, he said, to rehearse their accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson also contended that investigators were quizzing witnesses
months after they had given their initial accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The practice is an attempt to build inconsistencies into testimony
that might damage the Raughtons, he said.</TE>

<HD>Class Size Is a Big Issue for Teachers</HD>
<DH>With as many as 50 students in a room, critics say learning
is taking a back seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Pierson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a classroom with 45 seventh-graders, Jeanne Lavieri says she's
being asked to do the near impossible -- teach.</LD>
<LD>   She has 10 more students on average this year than last in each of
her art classes. Her lessons are 10 days behind schedule. Half of her
students are maintaining Ds and Fs. And she's had to abandon such
hands-on assignments as sculpture.</LD>
<LD>   "They already have problems using pens and pencils; I don't want
to see clay flying around the classroom," Lavieri said recently of
her students at Robert Frost Middle School in Granada Hills.</LD>
<TE>   At a time when the benefits of class-size reduction are being
challenged, teachers, students and parents in the Los Angeles Unified
School District say the quality of education is being compromised by
classrooms bulging with as many as 50 students.</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to reverse the increase will be the chief topic of
discussion at the Board of Education's Nov. 12 meeting. If nothing is
done soon, schools in West Los Angeles and the west San Fernando
Valley may have to consider year-round schedules.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer said the state's budget deficit is largely to
blame for the district's troubles. The financially squeezed district
saved $70 million by increasing class sizes this year, despite
efforts by the teachers union to halt the move.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the district is looking to see where it can reallocate
money to relieve the most crowded classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough economic circumstance we're in," he said. "We have
to manage our way through this year."</TE>
<TE>   Critics said a bad situation got worse last spring when the
district increased class size by two students in grades four through
12. Overall, the average class size in the district's middle and high
schools has increased by one student compared with last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm like a little hamster on a wheel," said Meg Schaffer, a
social studies teacher at Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills, who
has as many as 42 students in a class. "I haven't been this tired in
years. Teachers are going to start bailing. I'm not going to kill
myself for this district."</TE>
<TE>   Larger classes are common in West Los Angeles and the West Valley,
where schools such as Hale serve predominantly white, middle-class
families and are ineligible for extra funding based on race and
poverty. As a result, those schools have less discretionary money to
hire more teachers.</TE>
<TE>   But crowded classrooms can be found throughout the district, which
has about 730,000 students in kindergarten through high school.
Virgil Middle School, near Koreatown in Los Angeles, gained 300
students and lost 11 teachers last year. Class size jumped from the
mid-30s to the low-40s.</TE>
<TE>   During the first week of school, many students had no desks and
had to write on their laps.</TE>
<TE>   "Teachers are doing the best they can, but you can tell the stress
level is a little higher," Assistant Principal Philip Toyotome said.</TE>
<TE>   At Frost, the school year began with more than 50 students in many
science classes. Some children sat on overturned trash cans. When a
handful of teachers and parents protested, students were moved to
other classes to ease the most severely crowded rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Lavieri had 12 students shifted to other classes. Now,
her most crowded period has 43 children.</TE>
<TE>   District officials also say more classrooms are needed and it's
unlikely that conditions will improve unless voters pass a
$3.35-billion school construction bond on today's ballot. "It's a
matter of money and space," school board President Caprice Young
said. "We need both to get this to work."</TE>
<TE>   Already facing $450 million in budget cuts, the school board has
yet to determine how it will pay for more teachers if it chooses to
reduce class size. Initiatives throughout the country to limit class
size are being reconsidered because of tight budgets and studies that
have failed to show lasting achievements by students.</TE>
<TE>   California has spent $8 billion since 1996 to have one teacher for
every 20 students in kindergarten through third grade. But a recent
study by a consortium of public policy researchers determined that
the rush to hire more teachers resulted in too many under-qualified
instructors being hired and disappointing academic results.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne Allen, president of the Center for Education Reform in
Washington, D.C., said classes with more than 35 students were too
large, and she questioned why the district couldn't replace
administrators with teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Even with smaller class size, she warned that curriculum and
teacher qualifications were the most important factors when assessing
student achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "Districts like L.A. Unified have bigger problems than class
size," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For many educators, the notion that children learn better when
there are fewer classmates is a no-brainer, because teachers can give
more individual attention to students.</TE>
<TE>   Many teachers say classes are significantly more difficult to
teach once they exceed 35 students because too much time is spent
dealing with behavioral issues.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't separate the students with discipline problems, because
there's nowhere to put them," said social studies teacher Joe Norton
in his trailer classroom of 43 students at Frost. "We're not getting
a lot accomplished, and we have to worry about standardized testing."</TE>
<TE>   English teacher Erin Scanlon at Grant High School in Van Nuys drew
a line at the beginning of the school year. She said that once the 36
seats in her 12th-grade class filled up, she sent all additional
students back to their guidance counselors to find new classes.</TE>
<TE>   "I had kids sitting on the floor last year," she said. "I just
can't have that anymore. When there's too many kids, you lose them.
They don't pay attention. There is a point when it's too full."</TE>

<HD>Orange Diocese Cuts Don't Faze Parishes -- Yet</HD>
<DH>Self-sufficiency at the local level insulates churches, but
a moratorium on construction loans will have an effect later.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange announced its second
5% budget cut this year, many Catholic parishes said Monday that they
don't expect the financial woes to lead to significant reductions in
their programs.</LD>
<LD>   But after losing more than $14 million in each of two back-to-back
years, the diocese will not be granting any new loans to parishes
planning expansions or renovations. Diocesan officials have also
frozen or cut about a dozen administrative positions, and other cuts
may be coming as church leaders look for ways to trim expenses.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts "are obviously going to be difficult. We started out with
a pretty lean budget," said diocesan Chancellor Shirl Giacomi.</LD>
<TE>   At churches around Orange County, many officials said they don't
expect the cutbacks to affect their budgets because most parishes are
self-sufficient and, in fact, help support the diocese by sending in
a portion of collection plate proceeds and other donations.</TE>
<TE>   "The average Joe Catholic will not feel this," said Jan Zimmerman,
business manager at Holy Family Cathedral in Orange. "There could be
delays in capital improvements, but overall, the impact will be
minimal. In the church we sometimes joke we are moving on Vatican
time anyway.... That means slow."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the diocese gave St. Joseph parish in Santa Ana a
$200,000 loan to buy a neighboring house so St. Joseph could one day
expand.</TE>
<TE>   "We do need to expand further, and there's going to be a
moratorium on loans for the time being," said parish financial
manager Elena Schneider. "It won't affect us yet because we are not
ready to go forward."</TE>
<TE>   Father Eamon O'Gorman of St. Catherine of Siena Church in Laguna
Beach said his parish's plans to renovate and retrofit the church to
meet quake building standards may be delayed.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be breaking ground next May," O'Gorman said Monday.
"We're keeping a constant eye on the situation. We were told that if
we need a [building] loan, it might not be available."</TE>
<TE>   O'Gorman said his parish sees no need to make significant cuts to
its programs or services. Still, there has been "a little
belt-tightening" because collections at St. Catherine have been down
about $1,500 a month since last year's terrorist attacks, he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the diocese reported that it lost more than $14 million
for a second straight year, primarily because of losses in the stock
market, a rise in insurance costs, $12 million spent on critical
needs in poor parishes and $3.6 million to settle molestation claims.</TE>
<TE>   They are the first back-to-back losses in the diocese's 27-year
history. Three years ago, it reported a surplus of $21.5 million,
thanks largely to a windfall from stock investments.</TE>
<TE>   In July, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown ordered his department
heads to cut expenses by 5%, and now has asked for an additional 5%
cut to their 2002-03 budget. The diocese also imposed a one-year
moratorium on granting new loans to parishes.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese has $10 million in outstanding loans to parishes and
$19 million in loans scheduled for the next two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've loaned out as much money that we can be fiscally
responsible for," Giacomi said.</TE>
<TE>   The diocese saw imminent problems when its annual budget took
shape in July, she said. Besides the partial job freeze, two
employees have been laid off.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the diocese began communicating electronically with
parishes to save money. As for other cuts, Giacomi said, only
proposals are being floated, with nothing concrete until later this
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe instead of having two lunch conferences, they will have one
and serve a roll and coffee," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange diocese's losses over the last two years have depleted
nearly two-thirds of available reserves. The diocese does have an
additional $90.6 million in reserves designated for specific
purposes. The stock market slide lowered the value of the diocesan
investment portfolio from $227 million three years ago to about $182
million by the end of September.</TE>
<TE>   Giacomi said the budget woes in Orange County pale in comparison
to the those of the Archdiocese of L.A., where in September seven
church ministries were suddenly eliminated and 60 workers laid off.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Smith of the Catholic Worker, a community service group
running the largest homeless shelter in Orange County, questions the
financial priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said church officials have been too busy trying to make
money from their investments and have forgotten why parishioners
donated their hard-earned cash in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "Once the buildings are built, and everyone has a seat, then we
have to turn our attention to the plight of the poor," he said. "I
don't understand why we're investing money at all. I would like to
see an investment into filling the bellies of the poor, or in
schools."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Neighborhood Wants New Firehouse Built Elsewhere</HD>
<DH>The department insists the site it chose is the best, even
though housing units would be lost. It promises to help relocate
residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to build a new fire station in a Hollywood neighborhood has
sparked a fierce response from tenants who, fearing the loss of their
dwellings, are pushing city officials to select another location.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of the area where North Gramercy Place and Garfield
Place hit Hollywood Boulevard have called neighborhood meetings,
distributed fliers and sent officials a list of alternative sites for
the station -- all in a bid to save their residences.</LD>
<LD>   "We think the burden is going to outweigh the benefits to the
neighborhood," said Katherine Etzel, a 10-year Hollywood resident.</LD>
<TE>   But the city is already in escrow with two property owners and is
negotiating with others, said Battalion Chief Roy Prince of the Los
Angeles Fire Department, adding that owners have expressed a
willingness to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the site we want," Prince said. "No matter where we would
go, it was going to be an impact on the community one way or another.
We had to deal with that."</TE>
<TE>   The city is seeking to buy eight parcels, four of which are
parking lots. It is not clear how many residents would be displaced
by the station, but the site includes one 16-unit and two 13-unit
apartment buildings, as well as other residential properties, said
Allan Kawaguchi, program manager for the Proposition F Fire
Facilities Program.</TE>
<TE>   The Velaslavasay Panorama Gallery will also be forced to move if
the plan moves forward.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Councilman Tom LaBonge, whose district includes
Hollywood, supports building the station at the proposed spot.</TE>
<TE>   "After looking at several sites, this particular site has the most
available space to meet the need, and it is absolutely at the perfect
location," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The new Fire Station 82 would be at a midpoint between three other
stations and Griffith Park. It would be a regional facility, which,
unlike a standard fire station, includes a classroom, practice space
and a storage building.</TE>
<TE>   Regional stations cut down on the need for firefighters to be away
from their districts for training or to find replacements when
equipment breaks down, Prince said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year voters approved Proposition F, a $533-million bond
measure designed to fund 21 stations and the expansion or renovation
of eight animal shelters. The city has already purchased land for six
fire facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood conflict is another example of two important issues
colliding and housing "losing out," said Larry Gross of the Coalition
for Economic Survival, which is assisting residents.</TE>
<TE>   A coalition survey of the area found that about 47 housing units
would be lost.</TE>
<TE>   "You add that to the 1,000 units the school district is taking to
build new schools ... and that adds to our housing crisis," Gross
said. "All these government entities need to take the responsibility
to build replacement housing to mitigate the housing that they're
destroying."</TE>
<TE>   News that the neighborhood has been selected for a new fire
station has spread for weeks. Etzel learned about the city's
intentions "accidentally," she said, "pretty much how everybody on
the street found out about it."</TE>
<TE>   Some property owners received letters regarding the city's
interest and word that their property would be assessed. That
information soon spread.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated residents held a meeting at a local cafe to share
information they say the city had been slow to provide. Several
residents have complained that officials have not offered them any
opportunity to be involved in the selection, or clarified the
procedures the city must follow when acquiring land.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel left out of the process," Etzel said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say that revealing too much information about a proposed
site could jeopardize negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Residents will have an opportunity to offer input under the
California Environmental Quality Act, Kawaguchi said. The act
requires state and local agencies to examine the environmental impact
of proposed projects and, if possible, offset them.</TE>
<TE>   The way Tina Randall sees it, the timing of the project could not
be worse.</TE>
<TE>   "We've all lived in the neighborhood for a long time, and it's all
coming along nicely," said Randall, a tenant who lives in a 1910
Craftsman house. "Hollywood's getting better."</TE>
<TE>   Those fighting the fire station are mostly renters, with some
commercial tenants and at least one property owner joining in.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such a housing crisis in Hollywood," Etzel said. "People
know it's not going to be easy to find another apartment in this
area, particularly at some of the rents people are paying, because
it's been rent-controlled."</TE>
<TE>   Displaced tenants will receive relocation assistance, including
moving expenses. Often the city also offers financial aid to ensure
that renters are able to find comparable units.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not here to throw them out," Prince said. "We're here to
make them whole. We're obligated by law to do that. On top of all
this is the Fire Department image and credibility. We have a greater
obligation."</TE>
<TE>   Tenants say they are still hoping to stop the station plans and
will seek legal assistance.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether this whole thing goes through or not, what most concerns
me is the process that I've experienced," Etzel said. "It's a little
disturbing to see how our government works. It's really about due
process."</TE>

<HD>Cityhood Isn't Getting Easier for Fledgling Municipality of
Goleta</HD>
<DH>After its first year, the Santa Barbara neighbor finds
itself under relentless scrutiny, even for the design of its city
logo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Veronique de Turenne</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>GOLETA</DL>
<LD>It took two decades for the people of Goleta to get their own city.
They jiggered boundaries, tallied tax revenue and learned the fine
points of incorporation law before voting to make it official.</LD>
<LD>   Now, with nearly a year of cityhood behind them, it turns out that
getting there was, perhaps, the easy part.</LD>
<LD>   As the newest city in Santa Barbara County, Goleta's every action
gets analyzed. From a stop-work order issued last week to a developer
who violated a law protecting the city's beloved monarch butterflies
to the current search for a city logo, everything done by the city
brings out opinions.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still pretty new, and there's a lot of interest about our
city," said Margaret Connell, who serves as Goleta's first mayor.
"And there's a lot of passion."</TE>
<TE>   Take that logo, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   When the Santa Barbara News-Press ran an "unauthorized,
strictly-for-fun" contest for readers to suggest a city logo, more
than 80 people responded.</TE>
<TE>   Entries ranged from artistic arrangements of city staples like the
butterfly, citrus fruit and the sea, to political cartoons lampooning
the suburban sprawl that threatens Goleta's farmland.</TE>
<TE>   Goleta officials, who had hired a professional artist to craft the
city symbol, were miffed. They thought that the News-Press, which had
editorialized against cityhood and criticized some of the young
municipality's actions, was making light of Goleta's business.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have done anything in my power to dissuade you from doing
this," Connell told the newspaper. She worried that residents might
mistake the informal contest for an officially sanctioned design
search.</TE>
<TE>   A newspaper column about the contest argued that the entries show
a love for Goleta, and suggested that the city consider some of the
designs. "Phooey" and "Lighten up, will ya!" the column said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kathy Fritz, a Santa Barbara-based graphic artist chosen to
craft the logo for police cars, lapel pins and the city's stationery,
wasn't laughing. The design she is fine-tuning incorporates the
Pacific Ocean, mountains and, of course, a monarch butterfly. The
council is expected to make a final decision in November.</TE>
<TE>   Goleta, which earned cityhood when almost 58% of the populace
voted to incorporate last Nov. 6, deserves respect, Fritz said.</TE>
<TE>   "They made the whole thing seem like a game, and it isn't," she
said. "We're creating a visual identity for the city, and the people
who live here and love the place take that seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Some who live outside the city take a different view.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Shelton, an architect who was born and raised in Santa
Barbara County, was helping his children do their homework when he
first read about the contest. By the end of the evening, he had a
series of designs that needle Goleta for its shortcomings.</TE>
<TE>   "Goleta, where Santa Barbarans have to drive sometimes to buy
cheaper stuff," one logo reads, referring to the big-box retail
stores that provide a significant chunk of the city's tax base.</TE>
<TE>   Another logo features a felled citrus tree and the caption "Goleta
-- Once The Good Land," a reference to a decades-old nickname.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw an initial logo that Goleta was working on, and it showed
butterflies and orange trees and my reaction was, 'They've cut all
the orange trees down,' " Shelton said. "I mean, that logo is all
about stuff that used to be there and is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Shelton sees his drawings more as a challenge than a criticism. "I
want the city to make something good of itself," he said. "I've been
watching Goleta grow and the orchards get ripped out, so I fear for
its future."</TE>
<TE>   But Goletans said Shelton's view of the city's shortcomings is the
reason it incorporated in the first place. By writing its own general
plan and enacting zoning regulations, the city hopes to direct growth
to preserve what is left of its rural past.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a growing feeling of community in Goleta," Connell said.
"We're here to stay, and no matter how anyone thinks we should do
things, we'll do them in the way that's best for the city."</TE>

<HD>A Smoother Ride for the Disabled</HD>

<LD>Juan Galindo sat tall in the saddle as his horse was led around a
practice ring at Ride On Therapeutic Horsemanship, a Chatsworth
organization that teaches riding to children and adults with physical
and mental disabilities.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-year-old, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair,
comes to the training center twice a week for therapy to improve his
balance, muscle control, hand-eye coordination and language and math
skills.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes he complains about coming, but once he gets on the
horse he is excited," said Juan's mother, Leticia Correa of Sylmar,
as she watched her son ride. "I know the therapy is going to help him
in the long run."</LD>
<TE>   The annual Holiday Campaign of the Los Angeles Times Family Fund
was launched to help such programs as Ride On, which received a
$10,000 grant. The campaign gives aid to agencies serving the needy
and disadvantaged across five counties in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Since its founding in 1994, Ride On has given hundreds of disabled
people the opportunity to get out of wheelchairs and onto horses
under the supervision of physical therapists, certified instructors
and trained volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Ride On offers two programs -- hippotherapy, which emphasizes
therapy and always involves a licensed physical therapist, and
therapeutic riding, which focuses on recreational riding -- at its
two sites in Chatsworth and Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   During therapy sessions, instructors ask younger riders to count
the number of people standing around the ring, pick an apple from a
basket and drop it into a hoop on the ground and to talk about what
they did in school that day.</TE>
<TE>   Children with autism often open up and talk about their horseback
ride because they are so excited by the experience, said program
director Gloria Hamblin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think these kids would much rather be outside on a horse than
in a therapy room," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The practice ring also has become a place for children with
disabilities to meet one another, Hamblin said, adding that it's not
unusual to see children going off on play dates after riding lessons.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many recreational things they can do, so they are
really happy to meet other kids and hang out with them," Hamblin
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Holiday Campaign was established in 2000. The Times Family
Fund is a fund of the McCormick Tribune Foundation, which matches the
first $700,000 raised at 50 cents on the dollar. The foundation and
The Times absorb all administrative costs so every dollar raised,
plus the match, go directly to the agencies serving Southern
Californians.</TE>

<HD>School District Trustee Dies Day Before Bid for 4th Term</HD>

<LD>Oak Park schools trustee Bob Kahn died of complications from diabetes
Monday, the day before he had hoped to be elected to a fourth term on
the school board.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Marilyn Lippiatt described Kahn, 73, as a tireless advocate
for students and staff who worked to develop quality arts and
athletic programs in the Oak Park Unified School District. The
affluent district of 3,700 students consistently earns top scores
statewide on student achievement tests.</LD>
<LD>   Kahn's involvement with local educational issues began in 1978
when the district was created, Lippiatt said. He was first elected to
the board in 1989.</LD>
<TE>   "As a board member, Bob supported students, staff and programs,"
Lippiatt said. "He had special interest in both the arts and
athletics and was a vocal advocate for both. Bob's contributions were
many, and his voice, comments and sense of history will be missed."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo, who represents
unincorporated Oak Park on the Board of Supervisors, said Kahn was
active in getting a new public library built on the Oak Park High
School campus.</TE>
<TE>   "He was outspoken about the need for a public library in Oak
Park," said Schillo, adding that Kahn will be remembered at today's
supervisors meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real unsung hero for the service he's provided," Schillo
said. "You very seldom get any praise for what you do, and all you
hear is complaints from parents about what you did or what you should
have done."</TE>
<TE>   Kahn's public interest extended beyond education. He often
attended Municipal Advisory Council meetings to learn more about
other issues affecting his community, Schillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing school board member Linda Seaman said Kahn, a retired
insurance sales manager, was helpful to her when she joined the board
six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "He was good at explaining the history behind a decision and why
it was done that way," said Seaman.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn's name will appear on today's ballot alongside five other
candidates running for three open seats on the board. Should Kahn be
among the top three vote-getters, the Oak Park school board could
appoint someone to fill his seat for two years until the next general
election or hold a special election in March or June.</TE>

<HD>Klamath's Water Is Better Used Downriver, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Diverting it for cropland makes less economic sense than
using it for recreation, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Hymon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Higher water flows in the Klamath River along with increased salmon
runs could generate billions more dollars than is currently made from
irrigated cropland, according to a new federal study.</LD>
<LD>   The study by an economist with the U.S. Geological Survey
maintains that the recreational benefits of higher flows would be
felt mainly at the lower end of the river. The Klamath begins along
the California-Oregon border and flows 250 miles southwest to the
Pacific.</LD>
<LD>   The USGS study, released last week, looks at the economic
consequences of changing a policy on the way water is distributed
from the river. Under the Bush administration, that policy has
favored farming interests in the Klamath basin at the upper end of
the river.</LD>
<TE>   The study echoes provisions of a bill introduced Oct. 24 by Rep.
Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) that seeks $200 million to buy farmland
in the Klamath basin, boost river flows and improve water quality.</TE>
<TE>   For 18 months, a bitter battle for water in the Klamath River
watershed has pitted farmers against environmentalists and fishermen.
The conflict intensified this fall after 33,000 salmon died in the
lower river.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report on the cause of the
die-off is due, at the earliest, early next year, but state officials
and other interested parties believe the culprit was low flows due to
agricultural diversions ordered by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in
May.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the economic report by government economist Aaron
Douglas was to compare the costs and benefits of leaving more water
in the river versus current policy.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas found that recreation on the lower Klamath, including
sportfishing and rafting, currently brings in $800 million each year,
compared with $100 million in farm revenues in the Klamath Basin. The
farms there, covering about 240,000 acres, are the largest user of
Klamath River water.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Klamath basin itself would not benefit from the
down-river recreation, the study assumes that all the farmland in the
basin would be purchased and the farmers compensated handsomely. The
price tag for that and for restoring the entire Klamath watershed
would be nearly $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas said the economic benefits of such an ambitious project
would easily pay all the associated costs, including buying and
retiring some commercial fishing rights.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas determined that if all the proposed improvements were
made, the river would bring in $300,000 more in tourism money each
year. In addition, Douglas estimated, the benefits from investing $5
billion in restoration would exceed $40 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Economists have for years tried to calculate the worth of healthy
environments. Many conservation groups believe that eco-tourism, in
particular, will bring more steady money to a region than activities
subject to boom-and-bust cycles such as logging, ranching and
farming.</TE>
<TE>   But other proposals to save water by fallowing farmland have
proved enormously controversial because of the effect on agricultural
employment and on the businesses that depend on the farm economy.
Such is the case in the Imperial Valley in Southern California, where
residents are fiercely debating a plan to fallow fields and transfer
irrigation water to urban users in San Diego.</TE>

<HD>Music Center Names New President</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Music Center Board of Directors voted unanimously
Monday to name Stephen D. Rountree the new president of the downtown
performing arts center.</LD>
<LD>   Rountree has held successive executive positions at the J. Paul
Getty Trust for 22 years and is currently its executive vice
president and chief operating officer.</LD>
<LD>   He will take over at the Music Center on Nov. 18, succeeding
Joanne Kozberg, who has held the president's job since 1999. She
announced her resignation in April, effective as soon as the board
found her replacement.</LD>
<TE>   Rountree will take charge of the Music Center a year before its
newest venue, the Walt Disney Concert Hall, is scheduled to open.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past 20-plus years, I've been involved in the arts in Los
Angeles, and, with the opening of Disney Hall and the sort of
renaissance downtown, it all seems to come together at the Music
Center," Rountree said Monday. "I think it's an important juncture in
2002, to figure out how we can make the Music Center relevant and
connected to this broad and diverse community."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the board also named John B. Emerson, president of
personal investment management for Capital Guardian Trust Company in
Los Angeles, the Music Center's chairman-elect.</TE>
<TE>   Emerson will assume his new post next year, after the September
opening of Disney Hall. The current Music Center chairman, Andrea Van
de Kamp, will remain in place until then.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the center's four resident companies, the Los Angeles
Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Master Chorale, will move into
Disney Hall when it opens next year. The other two companies, Los
Angeles Opera and the Center Theater Group, will continue to present
productions in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Ahmanson Theatre
and the Mark Taper Forum.</TE>

<HD>LAX Fills Its Screen Team</HD>
<DH>The airport will finish phasing in the 1,600 federal
employees today, giving it the nation's largest such security force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Oldham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles International Airport will boast the largest passenger
screening workforce of any of the nation's 429 commercial airports
when the phasing in of 1,600 federal screeners is complete today.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover is being completed two weeks before the
congressionally set Nov. 19 deadline for the Transportation Security
Administration to deploy screeners at the nation's airports. As of
Thursday, federal screeners were working at 272 airports.</LD>
<LD>   Officials started phasing in federal screeners at LAX on Oct. 8.
They pointed out that there have been no major security breaches or
evacuations at the world's fifth busiest airport since the process
started. That, they said, is evidence that the security
administration's rigorous hiring and training methods are paying off.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a promising indicator," said David Stone, the agency's
security director at LAX. "We're pleased with initial ramp-up, but we
realize we have to improve every day."</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said they were satisfied with the ethnic
breakdown of the new security workforce and the retention rate of the
1,200 LAX screeners formerly employed by private contractors.</TE>
<TE>   Three out of four people in the new security force are members of
minorities, compared with about 98% of the private security force.</TE>
<TE>   One in four screeners employed by private companies passed a
battery of tests and were rehired as federal workers.</TE>
<TE>   This rate was higher than that posted at several other major U.S.
airports. Private screeners who passed the exam said experience
counted most.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a screener over two years, you see a little of everything,"
said an Inglewood resident, Cheryl Elliott, who worked for Globe
Aviation in Terminal 7 and was rehired by the security agency.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way to prepare yourself for this test," Elliott
said.</TE>
<TE>   About 350 private screeners who worked for contractors in the Tom
Bradley International Terminal and Terminal 1, who were relieved by
federal workers at midnight Monday, will take the security agency's
tests this week.</TE>
<TE>   Still, advocates who represented the private screening force said
they were disappointed that more workers hadn't been rehired.</TE>
<TE>   "We would have hoped that workers had a better retention rate,"
said Christie Arowosegbe, a policy analyst at the Los Angeles
Alliance for a New Economy, a nonprofit group that provides
assistance for screeners. "Another thing that hasn't been addressed
for the workers who have been retained is that there is no
seniority."</TE>
<TE>   As for the three of four private screeners who weren't retained,
about 40% were not eligible to become federal employees because they
were not U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Others didn't pass a computerized exam, which included a reading
comprehension section, or failed physical and medical requirements,
Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   The security agency's work at LAX is far from complete. The agency
must hire about 1,600 additional workers to screen all checked
luggage at the airport by Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   So far, about 130 federal workers are screening checked bags at 54
explosives-detection machines at the facility.</TE>

<HD>77 County Court Workers Laid Off Amid Deficit</HD>
<DH>Heavier job losses had been expected. Cuts come in response
to $57-million shortfall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Berry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Through transfers, attrition and other belt-tightening measures, the
Los Angeles Superior Court has trimmed an expected layoff of 150
permanent workers by about half, a court spokesman said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Allan Parachini said only 77 full-time, permanent court personnel
were laid off at the beginning of this month to help cover a
$57-million deficit for the current budget year. Just two months ago,
court officials anticipated eliminating 150 such positions, effective
Nov. 1.</LD>
<LD>   In late August, officials laid off 168 student, temporary and
probationary employees and announced the closure of 29 courtrooms.
The courtroom closures forced the transfer of nine judges to new
courthouses.</LD>
<TE>   Jail lockups at courthouses in Hollywood, Monrovia and South Gate
also have been closed.</TE>
<TE>   The budget shortfall stems from increased expenditures and a
$20-million reduction in state funding for fiscal 2002-03. The court
system gets 98% of its funding from the state.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the Legislature cut the $2.5-billion California trial
court budget by 3.7%.</TE>
<TE>   With its 600 courtrooms and $600-million budget, the Los Angeles
County court system is the largest in the state. It employs about
5,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Parachini said the 77 layoffs in Los Angeles County came from all
levels, "from top management to the bottom-level clerical positions."
He said each level on the salary structure was cut about 15%.</TE>
<TE>   Parachini said the courts saved some permanent jobs by eliminating
15 additional temporary positions in the jury services department
that had been exempted from August cutbacks. In addition, 25
employees scheduled for layoffs will become court attendants,
replacing armed sheriff's deputies serving as bailiffs in civil
courtrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Those bailiffs, who are paid more than their civilian
replacements, were reassigned within the Sheriff's Department,
Parachini said.</TE>
<TE>   Removing them from the courtroom was part of a $10-million
reduction in the court system's contract with the Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Parachini said no further layoffs are anticipated.</TE>

<LD>While issues such as gun control, campaign financing and the
environment have sparked spirited debates, the Libertarian candidate
for attorney general seems to have one issue to himself.</LD>
<LD>   Ed Kuwatch says that if elected, he will make public restroom
stalls more, well, private (see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   "Don't laugh," Kuwatch wrote in the Official Voter Information
Guide. "As I understand it, Barbara Boxer made banning pay toilets a
major theme of her campaign."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Good news for Democrats? Martin Bennett of Santa Rosa saw a recent
ad in the Sonoma Index-Tribune that hinted at a shortage of
Republicans in that area (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: It seems to me this has been a pretty
mirthless election campaign, but, luckily, Glenn Glazer saved a wacky
bit of addition from the March primary ballot (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where there's Smokey: In Huntington Beach, voters received one
flier from the Huntington Beach Firefighters Assn., which was
endorsing City Council candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The flier carried a curious photo. For legal reasons, the
firefighters pictured wore uniforms that bore no patches or badges.</TE>
<TE>   And the firetruck posed next to them was not a city vehicle. The
sign on the truck, only partially cropped out, said it had been
rented from Smokey's Fire Trucks.</TE>
<TE>   I checked the company's Web site and found that "Smokey's Fire
Trucks are available for birthday parties and many other types of
events, such as transportation, weddings, grand openings, etc."</TE>
<TE>   Admit it, Smokey -- political campaigns, too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Street transplant? Remember, Angelenos, if you vote in favor of
secession for the San Fernando Valley, you'll be invalidating the
unofficial song of the City of Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." has, as one of its lyrics, "Victory
Boulevard -- we love it!"</TE>
<TE>   I guess Newman could always rewrite that portion. "Venice
Boulevard -- we tolerate it!" Perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Excitement: In her "Inside Politics" column, my colleague Patt
Morrison noted that a wire service story referred to L.A. Mayor James
Hahn as "Kenneth K. Hahn."</TE>
<TE>   And, during a local reception for L.A. officials, NBC news anchor
Tom Brokaw mistook City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo for Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't blame the mayor for having an identity crisis. On one
network newscast several months ago he was called "Mike Haan." And a
city Public Works sign identified him as "James K. Hahn, Major."</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it -- Hahn is a bit lacking in the charisma department.
Which would seem to make him a prime candidate in California's next
gubernatorial election.</TE>

<AU>Patt Morrison</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is what I want you to do, right now.</LD>
<LD>   Put down the paper. Slowly tear out this column. Lay it aside. Put
it up on the refrigerator. Heck, put it in the refrigerator, if
that's where you're sure to see it tomorrow morning.</LD>
<LD>   Because that's when I want you to read this -- tomorrow morning,
after all the votes are counted, after all the confetti's been
Hoovered up from hotel ballroom carpets, and the campaign consultants
are packing for Bermuda holidays courtesy of all those contributors'
millions.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone clear on that? Fine.</TE>
<TE>   Now. Good Wednesday morning to you, and especially to all of you
whose names have ever appeared in the winners' category of an
election-night tally, and to all of you who work in any branch, any
level, any quarter of government in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   By now you'll have read that the secession measures that would
have amputated the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood from the body of
Los Angeles lost. The city of L.A. will remain the lumpish,
one-legged gerrymandered shape it's been for about as long as the
Thomas Brothers have been making maps.</TE>
<TE>   Well, hoo-flippin'-ray.</TE>
<TE>   There's not a lot of applause to go around here. The
anti-secession forces outspent the pro-secession team by more than
5-to-1. The anti-seceders' millions bought TV ads to scare voters
(with some justification) about the financial crapshoot of secession.</TE>
<TE>   What they didn't have to spend money to get was the benefit of
ballot language as dense and indigestible as a Texas fruitcake, and
voter indifference, that great lump in the civic belly where a fire
ought to be.</TE>
<TE>   So if I hear this morning that the marbled corridors of City Hall
are resounding with gloating and high-fives, I may just walk across
the street and deliver a few high-fives myself -- to somebody's mug.</TE>
<TE>   This election, winning should scare the politicians more than
losing. A winning secession vote could have left Los Angeles City
Hall like a wounded soldier, left to cauterize the wounds and then go
into rehab to learn how to get along with a big hunk of itself
missing. A losing secession vote means the still-whole city has to
figure out how to fight off the infection of disaffection.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to Fortress Spring Street, to everyone from Jim Hahn to the
road-repair dispatchers: Don't you dare get cocky and pat yourselves
on the back. You didn't win a war, you won an election. The war is
still going on. You haven't persuaded people that staying in the
embrace of Los Angeles is necessarily good for them -- you've just
frightened them into not bailing out.</TE>
<TE>   For Los Angeles' leaders to be celebrating this morning instead of
knuckling down to fix what was broken is to insult the seriously
alienated ranks of Angelenos beyond the Hollywood Hills, or even at
the foot of them.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, what might we be in for? Scorched real estate. First the
votes, then the vitriol. The Times' Beth Shuster found some in Hahn's
camp want the mayor to consider city contracts and appointments
against a list of who was with them on secession, and who wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Already, a Valley attorney named Bob Scott was yanked off the
Planning Commission over the summer, after he turned down a direct
invitation by a Hahn advisor, Scott says, to "go over to their side"
on secession, with hints that if he isn't with 'em, he's against 'em.
(No, no, no, demurred a Hahn spokeswoman, predictably. No connection
at all.)</TE>
<TE>   Reward and punishment, payoffs and positions. Enrich your
supporters, then maybe selectively co-opt a few of your enemies. It's
the classic Machiavellian technique of every canny ruler, crowned and
uncrowned: Dole out land or titles or business to keep your friends
happy and the squawkers quiet. And leave the foot-soldiers, the
rank-and-file, the abandoned masses, in the same condition they were
before.</TE>
<TE>   I've heard it said that Hahn has had the time of his political
life campaigning against secession. I'm so glad he had a good
election. The last time he built up such a head of steam for anything
was election night in 2001, when he won his job.</TE>
<TE>   And how is this energy carrying over past the afterglow of victory
parties? How to make the thrill of politics subside back into the
humdrum of policy again? I am sorry to have to tell you that our
mayor is considering certifying this election with a trip to
Sacramento to ask that the law be changed to make it hard for anyone
to try to secede again anytime soon. That'll teach 'em a lesson, all
right.</TE>
<TE>   Hey, Mayor H -- you can save the city the cost of the airfare. How
about just staying home, and fixing the way Los Angeles works,
neighborhood by neighborhood, so that no one ever again wants to
leave it? That's my idea of a legacy.</TE>

<HD>Crash Victims Out of Danger, Hospitals Say</HD>
<DH>More than 100 sought treatment after 198-car pileup on the
Long Beach Freeway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hospital and fire officials who responded to Sunday morning's
198-vehicle crashes on the Long Beach Freeway said Monday that all
those deemed at the time of the incidents to have been critically
hurt were out of danger, although some remained in serious condition.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 people sought treatment at eight hospitals. At one
time, several trauma centers in the Long Beach area were at their
limit, said Dr. Samuel Stratton, medical director of the Los Angeles
County Emergency Medical Services Agency.</LD>
<LD>   The two pileups in the southbound lanes of the freeway just north
of the San Diego Freeway interchange were caused by vehicles going
too fast in heavy fog. Stratton said they turned out to be a textbook
exercise for law enforcement and emergency services.</LD>
<TE>   Responding agencies included the California Highway Patrol and
Long Beach police and the Long Beach Fire Department, which sent 42
firefighters and 10 paramedics.</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred when trauma centers were still treating
victims of gunshots, ordinary traffic accidents and falls, which are
routine on Saturday nights. The arrival of a total of seven
critically injured people at three of the trauma centers -- St.
Francis, St. Mary's and Long Beach Memorial -- brought those
facilities to their maximum patient load.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ron Forgey of Long Beach Memorial Hospital said the most
critically injured person, a 77-year-old, had bleeding around her
heart and numerous fractures and bruises, but was stabilized within
hours.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and hospital executives held a
news conference outside Long Beach Memorial Hospital on Monday,
urging public support for a trauma center bond issue on today's
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said that, while massive accidents have occurred in the
Central Valley, which is often fogbound, this was by far the largest
number of vehicles ever involved in a pileup in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Fire Chief Terry Harbour said he could scarcely believe
that many drivers had been going 60 mph to 70 mph when visibility was
only 100 feet.</TE>

<LD>A teenager suspected of beating a neighborhood couple to death in
their bed was charged Monday with first-degree murder, burglary and
robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Adam Sarabia, 16, a continuation school student who lives with his
parents near the couple's home, is accused of using a baseball bat
and a knife during the killings. He will be tried as an adult,
prosecutors said, because of the circumstances and the brutality of
the crime.</LD>
<LD>   John Ramirez, Jr., 59, and Joann Wotkyns, 55, were found dead on
Oct. 21. Police said they believe that Sarabia had coveted their car.</LD>

<HD>Murder Defendant Admits She Lied</HD>
<DH>Toxicologist accused of poisoning husband says she was
embarrassed by her affair with her boss.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors fired questions Monday at a former county toxicologist
accused of fatally poisoning her husband, hoping to show she has a
history of lies and evasions.</LD>
<LD>   During a day of intense and nearly nonstop questioning, Kristin
Rossum, 26, admitted she lied on several occasions -- to detectives
investigating her husband's death, to a television news show and to
her husband's brothers after his death.</LD>
<LD>   Greg de Villers, 26, died two years ago Wednesday from a massive
dose of the painkiller fentanyl. Rossum is accused of committing
murder and trying to make it look like a suicide. If convicted, she
faces a possible sentence of life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   During her testimony, Rossum also admitted lying to her husband
about the extent of the affair she was having with her boss at the
San Diego County medical examiner's office, and about her recent drug
use.</TE>
<TE>   About a week before De Villers' death, Rossum said, she resumed
her methamphetamine habit, which she had quit five years before.</TE>
<TE>   Although questions from the prosecution came at her rapid-fire
throughout the day, Rossum appeared composed.</TE>
<TE>   When confronted with discrepancies between her testimony and a
transcript of an interview with police, Rossum admitted she did not
reveal the entirety of her affair to the detective. "I wasn't saying
the whole truth, no," Rossum said.</TE>
<TE>   "Because you thought it might make you look bad?" Deputy Dist.
Atty. Dan Goldstein asked.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very embarrassed," Rossum replied.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the prosecutor's tone turned sarcastic. After Rossum
said she didn't know why she hadn't told police that she had called
her boss the night of her husband's death, Goldstein shot back: "And
you graduated summa cum laude?"</TE>
<TE>   The murder defendant's composure broke only when Goldstein asked
her to identify De Villers in a couple of photographs. She cried
briefly.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein asked Rossum if she had any drugs in her system. Rossum
said she had taken a sleeping pill the night before and a half of a
Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug, that morning. She said her doctor had
prescribed the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum was much more emotional, sobbing often, when questioned by
her attorney last week. She began testifying Thursday and continued
Friday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not say how much longer Rossum would be on the
stand. They allege that she killed De Villers because he had
threatened to report her affair with her boss at the toxicology lab,
Michael Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Rossum denied on the stand Friday that she killed De Villers. She
previously said she believed her husband committed suicide because he
was despondent at the possibility she would break up their marriage
of a little more than one year.</TE>
<TE>   Under cross-examination Monday, however, Rossum admitted she had
never known De Villers to take drugs or to mention suicide. She also
said she had agreed with De Villers' brothers' belief that he had not
committed suicide.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to believe it was accidental," she said, "because I was
feeling so guilty."</TE>

<HD>Jurors to Begin Weighing Ryder Case</HD>
<DH>Prosecutor tells panel that actress shoplifted for thrills;
defense calls her victim of conspiracy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winona Ryder's shoplifting case went to the jury Monday afternoon,
after a prosecutor accused her of stealing for the thrill of it and
her defense attorney described the actress as a victim of a
conspiracy by Saks Fifth Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The jurors were ordered to select a foreperson and return this
morning to the Beverly Hills courthouse to begin weighing the fate of
the Oscar-nominated film star, who did not take the stand to defend
herself. Ryder faces a possible three-year prison term if convicted
on felony charges of grand theft, burglary and vandalism.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle said during her closing argument
that Ryder, 31, had walked into the Beverly Hills department store
with burglary tools and walked out with more than $5,500 worth of
designer merchandise that she hadn't purchased. Rundle then mentioned
one of Ryder's films, "Girl, Interrupted," which opens with her
character saying that she likes going into stores and taking items
just to see if she can get away with it.</LD>
<TE>   As jurors listened intently, Rundle urged them to convict Ryder,
giving a Top 10 list of what the law on shoplifting does not say.
Among them: Only poor people steal; crime is OK as long as your
director tells you to do it; if you sell $200 hair bows, you deserve
to get ripped off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a simple case of theft," she said. "She came, she stole, she
left. End of story."</TE>
<TE>   Rundle detailed Ryder's trip through the high-end boutiques of
Saks in December, showing clips of store surveillance videotapes and
holding up unpaid-for purses and blouses that Ryder had when she was
stopped by security guards outside the store. Some of those blouses
had holes where the actress had allegedly cut off security tags.
Ryder did not look like a glamorous movie star that day, but rather
like a person preparing to shoplift, Rundle said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor accused Ryder of carrying scissors into the store
to cut off sensor tags, tissue to wrap merchandise and a garment bag
to hide stolen clothing. The actress bought four items as a "ruse" to
allow her to steal about 20 more, which she stuffed into bags and
under her coat, Rundle said. When Ryder went into dressing rooms, she
sent sales associates to get her soda so she could have "all the time
in the world to conceal the items in her bag," Rundle said.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle played a portion of videotape that she said showed Ryder
taking sensor tags out of her pocket and stuffing them into a jacket
in the store's Gucci boutique. Four tags were later found in a Chanel
jacket, a security manager has testified.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutors also showed jurors a poster of Ryder's face with
balloon-style captions describing what security guards testified the
actress had said to explain her conduct. Guards alternately testified
last week that Ryder told them she had taken the items in preparation
for a film role or that she said she believed her assistant had paid
for them. No assistant was visible in the surveillance tapes played
repeatedly at the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Mark Geragos, in his closing argument, accused
Saks employees of lying and planting evidence -- including the
scissors -- to ensure that Ryder gets convicted and to insulate the
department store from civil liability. He said they would say
whatever it took to get a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos suggested that guard Colleen Rainey, who testified that
she had seen Ryder cut tags off merchandise, had profited from
Ryder's case. Security manager Kenneth Evans, who said he had watched
the actress walk out of the store with stolen merchandise, did so
only to appease his corporate bosses and to get "15 minutes of fame,"
Geragos said.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got all the best reasons in the world to fabricate
evidence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos, intimating that Rainey had planted evidence, showed his
own snippet of videotape, of the guard holding a red Saks bag and
running into the dressing room where Ryder had been.</TE>
<TE>   The testimony of Saks employees and police officers has fluctuated
more than the Nasdaq in recent months, the defense attorney added,
citing inconsistencies in their testimony and statements. Geragos
insisted that there had been no theft, suggesting that Ryder had left
her account open after making a purchase. Geragos also accused
Beverly Hills police of playing games with the evidence and Saks
personnel of purposely taping over another surveillance video.
Geragos posed several questions to jurors, which he said showed the
reasonable doubt needed to acquit his client: Why hadn't Saks
security people audiotaped alleged admissions by Ryder about
shoplifting in preparation for a film role? Why hadn't police checked
sensor tags allegedly found in the Chanel jacket for fingerprints?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't explain these things away, because there is no
explanation," he argued. "Someone is giving you a story."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Geragos made light of the case, saying that his
client is known for her fashion sense and asking if Saks believed she
intended to start a line of Winona wear -- blouses with holes in
them.</TE>
<TE>   Rundle said in her rebuttal that the defense case, in which four
witnesses were called, was based on "insinuation, accusation and
speculation." She accused Geragos of selling the jurors a "stupid"
story and of focusing on Saks employees to draw attention away from
Ryder's crimes. The employees, she said, were just trying to do their
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've offered you facts; they've given you hype," she told
jurors. "We've presented the truth; they've given you a story that
could have only been written in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Judge Elden S. Fox denied a motion by prosecutors
to admit as evidence a signed statement by Ryder that she had taken
the merchandise from Saks. The statement, at the bottom of a list of
items that she had allegedly stolen, was given to her to sign while
she was being detained at the department store.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also refused to let Geragos call Rainey's former
roommate to testify that the guard had defrauded Neiman Marcus by
returning merchandise at full price that she had bought at an
employee discount. Geragos argued that the testimony would have gone
directly to Rainey's credibility, but Fox ruled that it would not be
relevant because the alleged incident occurred several years ago.</TE>

<LD>The Teamsters union pledged Monday to shut down two Rolling Stones
concerts this weekend at Pacific Bell Park if the promoter, Clear
Channel Communications, does not agree to use union workers.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been having trouble with Clear Channel for years," said
William Cromartie, president of Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 85.
"They want to bring in kids to work for $6 or $7 an hour and give
them a T-shirt."</LD>
<LD>   About 50 Teamsters picketed Monday outside Pac Bell Park, home of
the San Francisco Giants, as tractor-trailers began arriving to
deliver equipment for the Friday and Saturday shows.</LD>
<TE>   The concert promoter said the Teamsters have long sought a
foothold in local events. "They are using this high-profile show to
strong-arm us," said Sherry Wasserman, a spokeswoman for promoter
Bill Graham Presents.</TE>

<HD>3 Rulings by 9th Circuit Reversed</HD>
<DH>U.S. Supreme Court faults a federal court in California for
nullifying convictions of two killers and granting an immigrant
asylum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage and Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. Supreme Court rebuked the federal appeals court in
California on Monday for having wrongly ruled in favor of two Los
Angeles-area murderers who had appealed their convictions earlier
this year.</LD>
<LD>   In a pair of unanimous decisions, the high court reversed the U.S.
9th Circuit Court of Appeals and reinstated the convictions. In a
third reversal -- also unanimous -- the justices said the 9th Circuit
wrongly granted asylum to a Guatemalan immigrant.</LD>
<LD>   It is rare for the high court to reverse a lower court's ruling
without hearing arguments in the case. But the justices did it three
times Monday.</LD>
<TE>   In all three rulings, the justices said the federal judges in
California had exceeded their authority by second-guessing a state
court or federal immigration authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a kind of a slap at the 9th Circuit, and a well-deserved
slap in my view," said Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   State prosecutors said that they were pleased with the decisions
and that they could speed the way to carrying out the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   California has by far the nation's largest death row, with 612
people condemned to die. Yet executions are rare, largely because
federal judges in California have been more willing to block state
officials than their counterparts in Texas and Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a very strong statement to the 9th Circuit that
they have misapplied the deference standard," said Dane Gillette, who
heads the death penalty unit for the California attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   He was referring to a 1996 law that tells federal judges that they
should defer to the rulings of state courts.</TE>
<TE>   The issue -- although technical -- is crucial in death penalty
cases. It also reflects a long-running debate over how judges should
decide an inmate's challenge to an old conviction. Under the Habeas
Corpus Act, state inmates can contest their cases in a federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Some federal judges say their main duty is to uphold
constitutional rights. If a state inmate appeals, these judges will
reverse a conviction if they believe the inmate's rights were
violated.</TE>
<TE>   But six years ago, the Republican-led Congress, at the urging of
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, passed a law that amended the
Habeas Corpus Act, making it harder for federal judges to reverse a
conviction that was upheld by a state supreme court.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of the law cited the perennial disputes between
California prosecutors and the 9th Circuit as a key reason for the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   The new law, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,
says federal judges should not take up an inmate's case unless the
state court's ruling was "contrary to ... clearly established federal
law as determined by the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Despite that high barrier, the 9th Circuit's judges have continued
to reverse convictions from the California courts, to the dismay of
state prosecutors and the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The court's action Monday revived a death sentence for John L.
Visciotti, who robbed and shot two co-workers in Orange County in
1982.</TE>
<TE>   He shot the two men repeatedly at close range and left them to die
in Santiago Canyon. But one lived and testified against him. At his
sentencing hearing, jurors were told that four years earlier,
Visciotti had stabbed two other people, including a pregnant woman.</TE>
<TE>   They sentenced him to die. The California Supreme Court upheld his
conviction and death sentence in 1992 and rejected a habeas appeal in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   In April, however, the 9th Circuit overturned Visciotti's death
sentence on the grounds that his lawyer failed to tell jurors about
Visciotti's drug use and his "absolutely horrendous family history."</TE>
<TE>   His attorney Roger Agajanian's "performance during the penalty
phase was deficient because he conducted essentially no investigation
in search of mitigating evidence about Visciotti," Judge Harry
Pregerson said. He was joined by Judges A. Wallace Tashima and Marsha
Berzon.</TE>
<TE>   Pregerson said he would have gone further and reversed Visciotti's
conviction because of the failures of his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer appealed and won a speedy
reversal Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision exceeds the limits imposed on federal habeas
review," the justices said. Rather than defer to the California
courts, the "9th Circuit ... ultimately substituted its own judgment
for that of the state court.... The circumstances of the crime (a
coldblooded execution-style killing and the attempted execution-style
killing of another) coupled with the aggravating evidence of prior
offenses (the knifing of one man and the stabbing of a pregnant woman
trying to protect her unborn baby) was devastating," the justices
said.</TE>
<TE>   These facts undoubtedly outweighed the concerns over Visciotti's
miserable family life. So, regardless of the lawyer's performance,
the jury was likely to return a death sentence in the case, the court
concluded in Woodford vs. Visciotti.</TE>
<TE>   Gillette, the California state attorney, said Monday's decision
clears the way for the state to execute Visciotti. "He has jumped to
the top of the list" as the next person to die, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Stratton, the chief federal public defender in Los Angeles,
said she was surprised by the high court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   The Visciotti case was a classic example of a defense lawyer "who
had no idea how to do a death penalty case. For the Supreme Court to
ignore that and throw it out on procedural grounds is very stunning,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The second ruling revived a long prison term for a Los Angeles
drug dealer who broke into a Hollywood apartment in 1987 and shot two
men, one of whom died.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the 9th Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling, said drug dealer William
Packer deserved a new trial because the judge in his original trial
had pressured a holdout juror to continue deliberations. The next
day, the jury returned a unanimous verdict against Packer.</TE>
<TE>   Judges Pregerson and Stephen Reinhardt spoke for the majority in
reversing Packer's conviction. Both were appointees of President
Carter. Judge Barry Silverman, a Clinton appointee, dissented.</TE>
<TE>   "Because this decision [of the 9th Circuit] exceeds the limits
imposed on federal habeas review ... we reverse," the Supreme Court
said in Early vs. Packer. The trial judge did not violate Packer's
rights when he urged the holdout to continue with deliberations, the
justices said.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson filed appeals in a
series of asylum cases to challenge the 9th Circuit. Federal law says
INS officials are to decide whether an asylum applicant faces
political persecution if sent home, but the 9th Circuit has sided
with numerous applicants whose claims were rejected.</TE>
<TE>   In a third ruling Monday, the justices sided with the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and reversed the 9th Circuit's ruling that
favored a Guatemalan immigrant.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, the high court will hear arguments in a pair of
cases Tuesday that involve California's appeals of 9th Circuit
rulings.</TE>
<TE>   California's "three strikes" law allows prosecutors to seek a life
prison term for defendants who commit three felonies. In some
instances, the third crime has been a petty theft. The 9th Circuit
has reversed several sentences on the grounds that this amounts to
cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   The justices will hear the state's appeal in the case of Leandro
Andrade on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara University law professor Gerald Uelman said Monday's
decisions "do not bode well" for Andrade or for other state inmates
challenging their death sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "If the Supreme Court is saying [the state ruling] practically has
to be irrational before you can come to a different conclusion, that
is going to affect a lot of cases," Uelman said. "They are sending a
loud and clear message to the 9th Circuit" that they "are not being
deferential enough on habeas reviews."</TE>
<TE>   But the news was not all bad for the 9th Circuit.</TE>
<TE>   The justices refused to shield two deputies in Humboldt County who
are being sued because they injected pepper spray into the eyes of
several protesters who tried to block the cutting of ancient redwood
trees.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit, in still another opinion by Pregerson, ruled this
police tactic "was plainly in excess of the force necessary under the
circumstances." Lawyers for Humboldt County urged the high court to
take up their appeal and to block the trial. But without comment, the
justices refused Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Despite this action, the county remains free to appeal again if a
jury sides with the protesters.</TE>

<HD>A Sprint to Finish for Secession Camps</HD>
<DH>Both sides of Valley and Hollywood measures spend final
hours hunting for votes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein, Patrick McGreevy and Kristina Sauerwein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the long-awaited vote on whether to break up Los Angeles just
hours away, activists on both sides of the secession fight took to
the streets Monday, knocking on doors in a last-minute effort to win
support the old-fashioned way -- voter by voter.</LD>
<LD>   In activities that ranged from the daffy to the down-home,
secession opponents posed with superhero look-alikes on Hollywood
Boulevard, held two rallies and walked precincts, crisscrossing the
city in a campaign day that started just after dawn.</LD>
<LD>   Secession supporters staged quieter activities, working the phones
and walking precincts. Proponents of Hollywood secession, led by
nightclub owner Gene La Pietra, whizzed back and forth across the Los
Angeles Basin, working the phones and issuing press releases from
their brightly painted Santa Monica Boulevard headquarters, zooming
across town to Pasadena for a five-minute interview with a British
radio show and heading back to Hollywood for more campaigning.</LD>
<TE>   Voters will decide today whether Hollywood and the San Fernando
Valley should be separate cities. On the ballot, Valley secession is
Measure F and Hollywood cityhood is Measure H. For either to win, it
must receive a majority of yes votes in the secession region, as well
as in the city at large.</TE>
<TE>   On the stump in Toluca Lake, City Councilman Tom La Bonge stopped
at every house on a stretch of Hortense Street, urging voters to
oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm your councilman," he told them. "And I want to be your
councilman on Wednesday after the election."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to recent polls showing secession trailing, nearly
everyone La Bonge encountered expressed support for the measures,
although several changed their minds after speaking with him.</TE>
<TE>   Language coach Gino DeFulgentis, who had favored secession,
questioned La Bonge closely on the pros and cons of breaking up the
city, and agreed to consider the councilman's arguments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll know the moment I'm there in that voting booth," DeFulgentis
told the councilman. "The fact that you've come to speak to me means
a lot."</TE>
<TE>   At the headquarters of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee, the scene was laid-back, with the telephones quiet as half
a dozen people pored over laptop computers and worked on plans to
boost voter turnout in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Moran, spokeswoman for the campaign, said it was more
important to spend time encouraging Valley residents to vote than to
stage a rally on the day before the election.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, a rally would be a waste of time," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of the secession group Valley VOTE, was
holed up in his Sherman Oaks apartment, writing a final campaign
flier, which he said would be faxed to 5,000 people and e-mailed to
8,000 more.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted victory for the colorful, moderately funded campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "We have strong support in the Valley and strong support on the
other side of the hill," Brain said. "People will recognize that the
Valley has the right to be independent."</TE>
<TE>   Eleven candidates for office in the proposed Valley city held a
news conference on the periphery of an anti-secession rally at Valley
College in North Hollywood. The event devolved into a scuffle, with
shouting and shoving between union members and the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been a good campaign," said David Hernandez, who is
running for Valley mayor. He said the campaign had brought Valley
residents closer and focused attention on the region's blighted
areas.</TE>
<TE>   "What this has done is put Pacoima back and bring the Valley
together," Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   On the secession ballot, Valley voters will select 14 city council
members and a mayor. They also will pick a name for the new city from
five choices. The winners of the races will take office only if
secession wins. The same is true for the candidates seeking five city
council seats on the Hollywood ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Monday, union leaders staged a get-out-the-vote drive and
a caravan of two retired firetrucks, an ambulance and a school bus
with banners urging residents to vote against secession and for
trauma center funding in Measure B.</TE>
<TE>   The first stop for the caravan, after it left San Pedro at 6:30
a.m., was a morning rally at Chesterfield Square in South-Central Los
Angeles where Mayor James K. Hahn told 300 activists that secession
will hurt the Valley, Hollywood and the rest of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   He said the breakup would result in less money being available for
city services.</TE>
<TE>   "We can make the city better. City workers are doing it every
day," Hahn said. "Let's stay together and make Los Angeles the best
city in America."</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by City Council President Alex Padilla, Hahn worked
the lunch crowd at Art's deli in Studio City and then met the labor
caravan at North Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla addressed the 100 precinct workers at the rally in Spanish
and English. "Los Angeles is one big community. We are one family."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Hahn danced with a woman at the Valley College rally, as
speakers blared the Randy Newman tune, "I Love L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Katz, chairman of the Valley secession campaign, spent the
day calling voters and doing last-minute bookkeeping. "I'm very
proud. We've done a phenomenal job."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police on Monday were searching for a gunman who opened
fire in a crowded auto parts store in Van Nuys over the weekend,
killing two employees.</LD>
<LD>   Byron Jackson, 40, of Van Nuys, allegedly got into a dispute
Sunday with clerks at an AutoZone store in the 16500 block of Sherman
Way after he was denied a refund on an auto part, Det. Angel Lopez
said.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police that Jackson, a regular customer, returned
to the store at 1:35 p.m. with a gun and fired several shots at two
employees.</LD>
<TE>   Carlos Avalos, 44, of Van Nuys died at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco Mercado, 34, of Pacoima was shot several times in the
upper torso and died at 1:20 p.m. Monday at Northridge Hospital
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Monroy, an employee at an AutoZone in Reseda who knew the
victims, said Jackson was denied a refund on a $20 auto part.</TE>
<TE>   He said Mercado and Avalos have both worked at the store for five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said Jackson drove away in a 1994 light-blue Dodge Dakota.
His license plate number is 6M29889. Police are asking anyone with
information on the shooting to call Van Nuys Division detectives at
(818) 756-8377.</TE>

<KH>BEHIND THE WHEEL</KH>
<HD>Internet Offers Way Out of Freeway Traffic Jams</HD>
<DH>Web sites that provide real-time updates are underused but
could become essential.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Leff</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes, Bob Andosca forgets. Without consulting an online traffic
map to see if I-5 is already backed up, he jumps into his car and
joins the other commuters deserting downtown Sacramento. The memory
lapse can be costly, adding 40 minutes and incalculable irritation to
a drive home that takes him an hour and 20 minutes under the best of
circumstances.</LD>
<LD>   "Because there are two routes I can take, I use this information
almost daily to plan which way to go," said Andosca, president of the
California Alliance for Advanced Transportation Systems. "When I
forget, an accident that occurred before I left the office might mean
I spend half an hour going three miles."</LD>
<LD>   If the head of a trade group that promotes high-tech solutions to
transportation problems occasionally overlooks the travel data he can
find on his computer, perhaps it is not surprising that the idea has
failed to catch on with the average motorist. Despite the
proliferation of Web sites carrying so-called real-time traffic
reports, such information remains an underutilized feature of the
Internet, something that appears to have as much relevance in the
minds of consumers as a month-old newspaper, according to content
providers and market research firms.</LD>
<TE>   "People are so used to getting what they need off the radio. They
already know that they are just going to be stuck in traffic or that
it usually takes them an hour to get home. So they aren't as
interested in looking up a particular problem because they figure
there isn't anything they can do about it," said Lisa Osborne, a
veteran radio traffic reporter who, two years ago, founded an
Internet site called Traffic411.com.</TE>
<TE>   But the public agencies and private companies that are trying to
put more useful traffic information into the hands of gridlocked
drivers insist that, if expected technological advances come through,
cyberspace could become as essential to commuters as cup holders.
Among the anticipated breakthroughs are programs that recalculate the
amount of time it will take to pass through a freeway segment, basing
the conclusions on current road conditions and in-vehicle navigation
systems that can direct motorists to alternate routes when they get
bogged down.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting the information in the car, a display of a map that will
show the approximate speed at the points you requested and recommend
a way you should go based on that, is where the industry is heading,"
said Clem Driscoll, senior partner of the market research firm
Driscoll-Wolfe.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, however, the traffic for Internet sites providing
traffic information isn't exactly bumper-to-bumper. According to a
survey of 2,500 adult Internet users conducted over the summer by
Jupiter Research, only 4% used the Web as their preferred medium for
receiving traffic updates, compared with 24% who favored television
broadcasts and 52% who counted on radio reports.</TE>
<TE>   John Cox, CEO of Travel Advisory News Network, a Diamond Bar-based
traffic information service launched five years ago with support from
the Southern California Assn. of Governments, acknowledged that
companies like his "haven't even scratched the surface yet, in terms
of reaching the number of commuters out there."</TE>
<TE>   Cox estimates that the maps his company produces and then makes
available through its Web site and the Web sites of media clients
such as The Times are seen by only 100,000 to 150,000 users a month.
This in an area where there are 6 million people on the roads every
day.</TE>
<TE>   "Every quarter-hour there are 1 million people in drive time
listening to a traffic report. We do about 1.8 million page map views
a month. That's nothing compared to what the radio is doing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   All traffic sites essentially rely on the same set of data, which
is obtained from California Highway Patrol reports and cameras and
sensors that Caltrans has installed along and under the freeways. On
most online maps, real-time freeway speeds appear in a string of
color-coded dots -- with green representing smooth sailing, yellow
troubled waters and red an SOS. Flashing stars and exclamation points
indicate accidents, construction zones and other hot spots.</TE>
<TE>   Some Web sites have additional features designed to make them more
user-friendly. At TrafficBee.com, for instance, an estimated 12,000
subscribers have signed up to receive free e-mail alerts about
problems on their regular routes. Duke Bristoe, a UCLA economist, is
a fan of the maps posted on Traffic411, which he visits whenever he
has to drive across town. Surveying the site late one afternoon last
week, for example, he could tell from the splashes of green and red
that "anyone leaving downtown right now should just take the 101
across, because the 10 is so jammed."</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a terrific service. I don't know why everybody
doesn't have it on their desktop. It will save you one hour a week,
if you routinely drive the freeways of Los Angeles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox of the travel advisory network said that feedback from the
savvy travelers who regularly use his service suggests that the
existing sites, though little used, are already prompting some
drivers to change their commuting patterns. About 87% of the
participants in a focus group and online survey indicated that they
had altered their travel plans on the basis of what they had seen on
the blinking maps, either delaying their departures or changing their
routes.</TE>
<TE>   "The avid user, the traffic junkie, knows more about what those
red dots mean on the map than Caltrans does, because they live and
die by those in order to make their commute more comfortable for
them," Cox said. The company's surveys show that the maps are used
most often in the afternoon by people in West Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   So if the sites are so helpful, why aren't more people using them?</TE>
<TE>   Both Cox and Andosca think that many people simply don't know what
is available. What the data show "is that the consumer is not aware.
The technology is here. It is being applied and deployed. But it's
not being marketed as a vital tool," Andosca said.</TE>
<TE>   The potential of online traffic information has also been limited
because its users have been able to use it only when they are at home
or at the office. Since driving conditions can deteriorate in the
time it takes to say "jackknifed big rig," the information quickly
becomes obsolete. As more cell phones and hand-held computers start
coming equipped with Internet access, interest should jump, according
to market analyst Driscoll.</TE>
<TE>   "People are tired of the fact that 90% of the information they get
on the radio doesn't relate to where they are going," he said.</TE>

<LD>Iranian officials said Monday that they have arrested and deported
dozens of infiltrators along the nation's eastern border, but they
did not confirm a report that one of Osama bin Laden's sons was among
the deportees.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said it was not
possible to verify the identities of people seeking to illegally
cross the border "because most of their documents are fake."</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, the Web site of Britain's Financial Times quoted
unidentified Iranian officials as saying that one of Bin Laden's sons
was among hundreds of people suspected of links to Al Qaeda detained
by Iran. But Asefi said at a news conference that his country was
unable to confirm the report.</LD>
<TE>   "Iran's border guards deal with all illegal entries of foreign
nationals in the same manner.... We have extradited dozens of them in
the past two months," he said, without elaborating.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Laden has at least 23 children by several wives. One of the
oldest, Saad bin Laden, who is about 22, has emerged as an Al Qaeda
leader and is one of America's top two dozen targets in the network.</TE>

<HD>Mexico's New Drug Policy Focuses on Small Picture</HD>
<DH>President touts gains against cartels but declares
substance abuse a destructive problem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Kraul</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Boasting success in fighting "big fish" drug traffickers and
high-level government corruption, President Vicente Fox is now
targeting small-time dealers in order to combat drug consumption in
Mexico, a problem that officials say is spiraling out of control.</LD>
<LD>   In an address Monday unveiling his anti-drug program and in his
weekly radio address Saturday, Fox said he would soon ask Mexico's
Congress to pass laws allowing municipal and state police to arrest
drug dealers, a power that currently resides only with federal law
enforcement officials.</LD>
<LD>   Mexican anti-drug efforts have focused on breaking up
international drug trafficking rings, including the Arellano Felix
cartel of Tijuana and the Carrillo Fuentes gang of Ciudad Juarez.
Citing 40 arrests of cartel leaders since he took office two years
ago, Fox pronounced Mexico's three biggest gangs "dismantled."</LD>
<TE>   But recent studies indicate that consumption among Mexicans of
cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamines is on the rise, a
trend that Fox said is threatening the social fabric by tearing apart
families and fueling a wave of kidnappings, murders and robberies.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a war we have to fight on all fronts, and it's not enough
to attack the supply. We have to keep demand from growing," Fox said
Monday at a gathering that included federal legislators and several
of his Cabinet members. "Together, the federal government, the states
and the cities will raise a wall to stop crime."</TE>
<TE>   The initiative comes as the Fox administration as a whole is
pointing to successes in its fight against drugs and corruption,
including the arrest of trafficker Benjamin Arellano Felix in March
and the confiscation of thousands of tons of marijuana, cocaine and
heroin in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators arrested 22 federal officials last month for
allegedly feeding law enforcement information to drug mafias. Also in
October, the army disbanded its 65th Battalion in Sinaloa state.
Instead of combating the drug trade, the unit was helping traffickers
transport drugs.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a military tribunal convicted two army generals,
Francisco Quiros Hermosillo and Mario Arturo Acosta Chaparro, of
helping the Juarez cartel transport drugs to the U.S.-Mexican border.</TE>
<TE>   Although the amount of drugs that Mexico has confiscated since Fox
took office is roughly equal to seizures of recent years, UC San
Diego professor Peter H. Smith believes it may represent a greater
percentage of the overall flow. Drug shipments from Mexico are
probably down over the last year or two, with much of it now diverted
through the Caribbean, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "With the persistence of drug demand in the United States, there
are real limits to what authorities in drug-producing and in-transit
countries can do, other than raise the cost of doing business," Smith
said. "But within the constraints that Mexico faces, Fox is probably
doing as well as we could possibly hope for."</TE>
<TE>   Although he said he doubts that Fox's plan to cut consumption and
production will work, Jorge Chabat, a professor at Mexico City's
Center for Economic Research and Teaching, gave the president credit
for the arrests of top traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly improves Mexico's image vis-a-vis the United States,
and that's not minor," he said.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Oil Lies Below Surface of U.N. Talks</HD>
<DH>Economic stakes are high as the five key Security Council
members discussing a military strike on Baghdad eye its reserves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani and John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One issue that could influence the outcome of the United Nations'
debate on Iraq isn't even on the official agenda. It's the thorny
question of who will control the hundreds of billions of dollars'
worth of oil beneath the ground.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to being permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia are
home to the world's leading energy companies, all of which are
anxious to get access to Iraq's oil, the world's second-largest
reserves behind Saudi Arabia.</LD>
<LD>   While the politics of arms control and regime change dominate the
public debate, an equally impassioned struggle is taking place over
the economic stakes surrounding the U.S.-led campaign to oust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   "Everybody knows why the United States is doing this," said
Nikolai P. Tokarev, general director of Zarubezhneft, a Russian
state-owned company that has been involved in oil production and
sales in Iraq since 1967. "The only reason is the U.S. desire to
establish full control over the oil-gas complex of Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   British and U.S. firms dominated Iraq's oil industry until it was
nationalized in the 1970s. British Petroleum held nearly one-quarter
of the shares of Iraq Petroleum Co.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Iraq has turned to Russia and France for help in
restoring an oil sector damaged by war with Iran, the Persian Gulf
War and more than a decade of economic sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   A key concern for Russia, France and China is whether a new
government would honor Iraq's existing agreements. Russia's Lukoil
has the largest stake in Iraq, having signed a 23-year, $3.5-billion
contract in 1997 to develop the giant West Qurnah oil field. France's
TotalFinaElf has been negotiating to explore the Majnoon field, whose
reserves are estimated at 20 billion to 30 billion barrels.</TE>
<TE>   And China National Petroleum Corp. has a contract to develop part
of the Rumaila production area, which was substantially damaged
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   "Hussein's replacement with somebody else, particularly someone
who is appointed by the U.S. government, will mean that Russia may be
ousted from Iraq sooner or later," said Viktor A. Kremenyuk, deputy
director of the USA-Canada Institute in Moscow. "Therefore, it
becomes clear that resolving the Iraq problem is all about the
rivalry around one of the richest oil countries in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Though the leading U.N. players have a huge stake in the future of
Iraq's oil industry, observers are divided over how much oil politics
might affect the Iraq vote expected this week.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a theory floating around that one of the things the
U.S. would do to garner support from the Russians, Chinese and French
in the Security Council is to honor the deals that were agreed to" by
the present Iraqi government, said John Kingston of Platts, an energy
information service in New York. "But I don't see any signs of that.
That might be tough for people to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration denies that it is masterminding a U.S.-led
division of Iraq's lucrative oil reserves to benefit American
multinational companies or its allies.</TE>
<TE>   "The only interest the United States has in the region is
furthering the cause of peace and stability. And what has brought the
region to the point where the United Nations is making decisions
about what the appropriate means are to enforce Saddam Hussein to
comply with U.N. resolutions is his defiance of U.N. resolutions, not
his country's ability to generate oil," White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Exiled Iraqi dissidents, who have been drawing up plans for a
post-Hussein government, have said they will want to examine existing
energy contracts benefiting Hussein and his entourage at the expense
of the Iraqi people.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether the current bartering at the Security Council
will have an impact on future oil deals, Salah Shaikhly, an economist
and former deputy minister in Iraq who is a leader of a London-based
opposition group, replied, "We have to look at who helped to free
Iraq and who took Saddam's side at our time of need. As the saying in
the West goes, people should be equal. But some should be slightly
more equal than others. The fact that Britain and the United States
were there for us should give them some slight leverage."</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Exxon Mobil Corp. and ChevronTexaco Corp., two of
America's leading oil companies, refused to comment on their interest
in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not speaking on the topic at all," said Cynthia Langlands,
a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil.</TE>
<TE>   The importance of Iraqi oil to the United States and its allies
increased dramatically after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks because
of concerns about the security of their oil supplies and their
dependence on Persian Gulf suppliers, particularly Saudi Arabia,
according to Fadhil Chalabi, executive director of the Center for
Global Energy Studies in London and a former Iraqi Oil Ministry
official.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq is sitting on about 11% of the world's proven oil reserves --
about 112 billion barrels -- and that oil can be produced cheaply,
for about $1.50 a barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Chalabi estimates that it will take $5 billion to restore the
fields to their previous production levels of 3.5 million barrels a
day and an additional $30 billion to increase those levels to as much
as 10 million barrels a day. Oil has been selling at around $30 a
barrel.</TE>
<TE>   "The oil is abundant, cheap to produce and can be delivered on
pipelines to eastern Mediterranean ports, thereby bypassing the
Gulf," said Chalabi, whose center is organizing a gathering in
December to discuss the future of Iraq's oil industry.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's reentry in a big way into the global markets would probably
bring down prices, which would benefit big importers such as the
United States, China and Singapore. China is the world's
second-largest consumer of energy behind the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But lower oil prices would create problems for U.N. members that
are heavily dependent on oil revenues, such as Russia and Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Syria, a Security Council member with close ties to Hussein's
regime, stands to be a big loser if economic sanctions against Iraq
are lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Syria has developed a lucrative business selling goods to Iraq and
is importing up to 250,000 barrels a day of discounted oil from that
nation, according to Nimrod Raphaeli, a senior analyst with the
Middle East Media Research Institute in Washington.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Enters a Legal Gray Zone</HD>
<DH>Strike in Yemen raises thorny questions of assassination
and the definition of war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader and Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In striking dead an alleged close associate of Osama bin Laden in
Yemen, the Bush administration has entered a murky area of
international law and demonstrated it will use more aggressive and
controversial tactics to defend American interests abroad than the
U.S. has historically employed.</LD>
<LD>   When a Hellfire laser-guided missile screamed out of an unmanned
Predator drone and straight into a car carrying Qaed Sinan Harithi on
Sunday, the United States may have violated international law, or it
may not have. The answer depends on whether the Yemeni government
acceded to the strike, international law experts said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But the attack clearly placed the Bush administration outside the
bounds of actions recent U.S. administrations have acknowledged
taking to defend American interests overseas.</LD>
<TE>   "Where we have refrained from doing this in the past, it's been
the judgment of the U.S. that killing our enemies abroad is a very
foolish thing to do," said Alfred P. Rubin, a former Pentagon counsel
and a professor of law and diplomacy at Tufts University.</TE>
<TE>   "After all, the Soviets killed their enemies abroad, and the
Iranians have tried to do the same thing against [author] Salman
Rushdie. We decided a long time ago that this was not a wise thing to
do. It was not consistent with our vision of where the world should
be going. But now we apparently have changed our minds."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 attacks, blamed on Bin Laden's Al Qaeda
network, the Bush administration has steadfastly argued that the
United States is at war with the terrorist group, wherever its
tentacles reach.</TE>
<TE>   However, the United Nations Charter forbids a nation to intervene
in the internal affairs of a country with which it is not at war. So
unless Yemen agreed to the strike by the CIA drone, the United States
acted in violation of the U.N. Charter.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Monday that Yemen has
been acting in close cooperation with the U.S. in the war on
terrorism, but he did not say whether the Yemeni government was aware
of and had permitted Sunday's strike.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the question of Yemeni involvement lies the deeper question
of defining war. The Bush administration says that it is engaged in a
worldwide war against terrorists that is far more than rhetorical,
and that it views attacks on suspected terrorists as military strikes
against combatants.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows they are not looking at this in a law enforcement
context but in a military one. And in a military conflict, you shoot
to kill the enemy," said Suzanne Spaulding, former executive director
of the National Commission on Terrorism, a former lawyer for both the
CIA and the Senate Intelligence Committee, and chair of the American
Bar Assn.'s standing committee on law and national security.</TE>
<TE>   Robert K. Goldman, a professor of international law at American
University's Washington College of Law, said the situation presents a
new paradigm because most of the laws that have evolved about war
involve hostilities between countries.</TE>
<TE>   "If you assume the U.S. can be at war against non-state actors,"
Goldman said, members of Al Qaeda "are combatants who are susceptible
to direct attack at all times."</TE>
<TE>   "The basic premise is that the U.S. regards itself as at war with
Al Qaeda. That being the case, it regards members of Al Qaeda as
combatants engaged in war against the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   But the United States is not at war with Yemen. In seeking out and
killing its avowed enemies anywhere it finds them without arresting,
charging and trying them first, critics of such a strike say, the
U.S. mirrors the Israeli government, which has been criticized for
carrying out "extrajudicial executions" in response to terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go down this path, we might find ourselves in the same
position that Israel is in," Rubin said. "We can target terrorists
too if we like. But I don't think it's brought very much peace to the
Middle East, and I don't think it's going to bring very much peace to
the U.S. either."</TE>
<TE>   While some may consider the attack in Yemen an assassination,
Goldman said it was different from U.S. attempts decades ago to kill
foreign leaders. Those attacks led President Ford to promulgate an
executive order prohibiting political assassinations; it has been in
force since 1976.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not an assassination. The U.S. is not in a situation of
peace with these people. This is not putting poison into Castro's
toothpaste," Goldman said. "My view is the administration has a
strong argument based on the doctrine of self-defense and the
continuing threat from Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   M. Cherif Bassiouni, professor of international law at DePaul
University in Chicago, who headed the U.N. commission investigating
war crimes in the former Yugoslav federation, said the most
appropriate comparison would be if a U.S. drug agent killed a
narcotics trafficker rather than arresting him and putting him on
trial.</TE>
<TE>   Bassiouni said that any relatives of those killed in Yemen might
be able to sue U.S. officials who approved or participated in the
attack under the Alien Tort Claims Act. He said the CIA could not be
sued because it has governmental immunity.</TE>
<TE>   The attack "is a dangerous precedent," Bassiouni said. "The
biggest danger is something that is intangible. It suddenly puts
governments at the same level as terrorists. If we come down from the
moral heights and start wallowing in the same mud as the terrorists,
we have lost our legitimacy and we can no longer marshal the claim of
moral authority for us and immorality for them."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the U.S. has attacked targets in countries with
which it was not at war, although such strikes apparently did not
target specific individuals. In 1998, for instance, the Clinton
administration used cruise missiles to destroy a pharmaceutical
factory in Sudan that it claimed was involved in chemical-weapons
production.</TE>
<TE>   Although military lawyers have taken an increasingly prominent
role in vetting U.S. strikes on a range of targets, it is unclear
whether they were consulted about Sunday's attack in Yemen. In
previous cases, the U.S. has refrained from killing individuals on
advice of lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, in October 2001, a Predator drone targeted Taliban
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar at the start of the war in Afghanistan,
but military lawyers could not decide whether he was a permissible
target, officials have said. The missiles were ultimately fired near
him, but not to kill him.</TE>
<TE>   In May, a CIA Predator attacked Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar
near Kabul, the Afghan capital, missing him but killing some
followers. Hekmatyar had offered rewards for anyone who killed U.S.
troops. The former Afghan prime minister is said by U.S.
counter-terrorism officials to be loosely associated with Al Qaeda.</TE>

<HD>In Egypt, a Bastion of Learning Rises From the Ashes of
History</HD>
<DH>Alexandria gets a $200-million edifice to replace the
legendary library torched in ancient times. Already it is a symbol of
hope.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Egypt</DL>
<LD>More than a millennium after it was sacked and burned in an era of
religious fanaticism, Alexandria's library has risen again on the
Mediterranean shore -- a reminder, as President Hosni Mubarak put it,
that "cultural dialogue must be a substitute for violence in a world
torn by conflict."</LD>
<LD>   The reopening of the library, once the world's greatest repository
of scrolls and knowledge, marked the completion of a 20-year,
$200-million project. Ceremonies held Oct. 16 were attended by
Mubarak, the presidents of France, Italy and Greece, the queens of
Jordan, Sweden and Spain, 14 Nobel laureates and a choir of children
who performed Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Arabic.</LD>
<LD>   The reopening came as Egypt and its Arab neighbors are again
confronting the threat of religious zealotry. This time, however, the
fanatics are Muslims, rather than the Christians who attacked the
library as a pagan institute and killed its last great scholar,
Hypatia, a philosopher and mathematician, in AD 415. Despite fires
and sackings over several hundred years, parts of the collection
survived for centuries.</LD>
<TE>   Egyptians hope the new high-tech, computer-laden Bibliotheca
Alexandrina will kindle a cultural revival in a country where the
educational system is in tatters and 49% of people age 15 and over
are illiterate. Plans are afoot to hold international seminars on
global issues at the library and to build its collection -- now
250,000 books -- to 8 million volumes.</TE>
<TE>   The original structure attracted scholars such as Archimedes,
Eratosthenes and Euclid in ancient times. It is where the Old
Testament was first translated from Hebrew to Greek.</TE>
<TE>   But there are concerns that today's environment -- Egypt has tight
censorship, and Islamic extremists show little tolerance in many
matters of modernity -- will hinder a diverse acquisition of books,
thus limiting the library's usefulness as a center for research and
learning. Egypt's Nobel laureate in literature, Naguib Mahfouz, was
stabbed in the neck by a militant in 1994 after the religious
establishment labeled one of his novels blasphemous. And nowhere in
Alexandria or Cairo does one find books perceived as critical of
Egyptian foreign policy or Mubarak or Islam, such as Salman Rushdie's
novel "The Satanic Verses."</TE>
<TE>   "You won't find my books in the Alexandria library either, and I'm
not sure you ever will," said Nawal Saadawi, a militant feminist and
sometime government critic. Many of her 27 books deal with women and
sexuality, a sensitive subject in the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   David Wardrop, who founded UK Friends of the Alexandria Library
and has advised officials on acquisitions, said that censorship is a
concern but that the significance of Bibliotheca Alexandrina goes
beyond its role as a library. Otherwise, he said, it would not have
received the support and financial backing of UNESCO, the U.N.
cultural organization, as well as governments, scholars and human
rights advocates from throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   He and other international supporters have challenged the
government to use the facility to reintroduce the concept of
democratic dialogue to Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity for them to use the library as a sort of
Hyde Park, where they can voice their opinions in freedom," he said,
referring to the park in London noted for the public discussions of
current issues that take place there.</TE>
<TE>   Wardrop's organization has presented Bibliotheca Alexandrina with
microfiche copies of 14,000 Arabic manuscripts from the British
Library.</TE>
<TE>   "We are continuing to press the 'Bibalex' to stage events and
symposiums which couldn't be staged elsewhere in the Middle East," he
said. This is where issues such as Mahfouz's criticized novel and the
absence of Saadawi's books could be raised and debated, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The 11-story library, designed by the Norwegian architectural firm
Snohetta, is striking in appearance. It rises from the ground like a
giant disc tilted toward the sea. Its reading room is as big as New
York's Grand Central terminal. It has a conference center,
planetarium, museum space, 300 Internet-connected computers and a
computerized card catalog. The largest and most advanced complex of
its kind in the Arab world, it has already become a major attraction
in this city established by Alexander the Great in 332 BC.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever its future as a center of learning, the resurrected
library became an important symbol the day it opened to a region
clouded by strife, poverty and uncertainty. It stood as a celebration
of humanity's shared heritage and was, Mubarak said at the
inauguration, "a call to terminate violence, tension and all sorts of
terrorism."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bombing Kills 2 Israelis and Injures 15</HD>
<DH>Sharon reportedly will announce his intention to call early
elections. Also, two Palestinians in a van die in West Bank
explosion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>JERUSALEM -- A Palestinian suicide bomber made his way to the edge of
an open-air shopping mall in a leafy Tel Aviv bedroom community at
dusk Monday and detonated a bomb strapped to his body, killing two
Israelis and injuring at least 15 others, including two infants.</LD>
<LD>   A security guard, who was one of those killed, managed to block
the bomber from entering the mall and causing many more casualties,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The latest violence came against a backdrop of political drama
triggered by the collapse last week of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
alliance with the left-center Labor Party, which pulled out of his
coalition and left him without a parliamentary majority. Israeli
television reported this morning that Sharon will announce today that
he intends to call early elections.</LD>
<TE>   The report said Sharon had told President Moshe Katsav he intends
to set elections for February, nine months ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's bombing came as Sharon's minority government survived a
succession of three no-confidence votes in the Knesset, Israel's
parliament, only moments before the suicide attack in the central
city of Kfar Sava, six miles from Tel Aviv. It was the second suicide
bombing aimed at Israelis in nine days.</TE>
<TE>   The parliamentary proceedings, said Cabinet Minister Danny Naveh,
were held "in the suffocating atmosphere of a new attack ... a new
reminder that we are still facing a war of terror."</TE>
<TE>   Initial reports of the suicide blast were just filtering in as Lt.
Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the architect of some of Israel's harshest measures
against the Palestinians, was sworn in as Sharon's new defense
minister.</TE>
<TE>   Mofaz's term as military chief of staff ended in July, raising
unease in some quarters that the transition period was too short
between his army career, in which he oversaw day-to-day Israeli
operations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and his new Cabinet
position, in which he will be involved in making policy regarding the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "It is totally unhealthy!" said lawmaker Yossi Sarid, whose
left-leaning Meretz Party led the fight against Mofaz's confirmation
and also spearheaded the no-confidence votes against Sharon. "Orderly
countries know that military men, especially if they took off their
uniform only three months before, are not appointed to the position
of defense minister, creating the impression that Israel is
supposedly ruled by a military junta."</TE>
<TE>   In what might have been a continuation of a controversial policy
that flourished under Mofaz, a member of the militant Islamic group
Hamas and one other Palestinian died in an explosion that ripped
through the van they were driving in the West Bank city of Nablus.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians denounced the incident as an assassination -- one of
dozens of targeted killings in the last two years of Palestinian
militant leaders blamed for planning or carrying out attacks on
Israelis. The chief of Palestinian intelligence in Nablus, Moeen
Sakaran, said he believed the vehicle had been booby-trapped and
blown up by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military, which rarely acknowledges carrying out such
killings, had no comment. One of the dead Palestinians was identified
as Hamad Sadr, a member of the military wing of Hamas. Sadr was an
uncle of Mohammed Bostami, a Palestinian who carried out a suicide
attack last week in the West Bank settlement of Ariel that killed
three Israeli soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's blast in Kfar Sava, which lies close to the West Bank,
came at a busy time of day at the palm-shaded Akim shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   The airy passageways were full of adults who had gotten off work
in time to run a few errands and of high-school kids drawn to the
mall's video arcades, fast-food joints and chain stores.</TE>
<TE>   An electronics store took the brunt of the explosion, which left
the mall walkway littered with broken glass and pieces of scorched
appliances.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a guy bleeding, lying in a pool of blood, and a leg that
wasn't his next to him," witness Ron Kenzi told Israeli radio.</TE>
<TE>   "The shock wave was huge and hit us very hard," a 12-year-old
named Danna Seton said from her hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said a security guard, one of two dozen on duty at the
mall, had apparently spotted the bomber and moved to intercept him,
but the man managed to detonate more than 20 pounds of explosives
strapped around his waist.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the bomber and the guard, a bystander died. The
body of the bystander was so mutilated that authorities were not
certain whether the victim was a man or a woman.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the blast's destruction would have been magnified
in a confined space; in the open air, it was lessened.</TE>
<TE>   The bomber was identified by Israel as Nabil Sawalha, from the
Balata refugee camp outside Nablus. He was believed to be a member of
the militant Islamic Jihad, which has been responsible for scores of
deadly attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the State Department cited the attack in urging
Americans in the Middle East to exercise caution. "We obviously
condemn these kinds of activities in the strongest possible terms,"
said spokesman Richard Boucher.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli authorities characterized the attack as graphic proof of
the threat faced every day throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody put on a suicide belt and walked into the heart of a
shopping center with the hope of killing as many Israeli men, women
and children as possible," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel
Taub. "This is plain and simple terror, and if we don't fight it with
every means at our disposal, it's going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have been expressing fears that a new Sharon
government will tighten the hold that Israel's military already has
on the West Bank's major cities. Israel says strict control over
Palestinians' movements has lessened the toll of suicide attacks;
Palestinians say constant curfews and travel restrictions make daily
life a misery.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, who was fighting to rebuild a parliamentary majority, had
been seeking the support of a far-right party, Yisrael Beiteinu,
which supports the expansion of Jewish settlements and rejects any
peace overtures toward the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   But the party demanded that Sharon adopt some of its hard-line
policies, including formally rescinding the 1993 Oslo peace accords.
Sharon said he would not agree to that.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the wrangling, Israel's first openly gay lawmaker,
62-year-old university professor Uzi Even, was sworn in Monday,
replacing a Knesset member who resigned. Ultra-Orthodox Jewish
lawmakers staged a walkout when Even stood up to deliver his
inaugural remarks.</TE>

<HD>Hussein Takes New Tack on Inspections</HD>
<DH>Iraqi says he might agree to a resolution if it did not
'provide a cover' for a U.S. strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Monday that he would consider
cooperating with a new U.N. resolution on arms inspections, provided
it was not merely a pretext for the U.S. to attack his nation.</LD>
<LD>   "If a resolution is issued that respects the U.N. Charter,
international law and Iraq's sovereignty, security and independence,
and does not provide a cover for America's ill intentions, we will
view it in a way that makes us deal with it," official Iraqi TV
quoted Hussein as telling visiting right-wing Austrian politician
Joerg Haider.</LD>
<LD>   The comment appeared to mark a shift in Baghdad's stance. Until
now, Iraqi officials have been hostile to the idea of a new
resolution governing U.N. inspections of its alleged programs to
develop nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and said they would
accept inspectors only on terms laid down in previous resolutions.</LD>
<TE>   The remark appeared aimed at preparing Iraqis for acceptance of a
new resolution and at buying time to stave off any U.S. attack.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. and Britain say they will make changes this week to a
tough U.N. Security Council draft resolution intended to give
inspectors unfettered access to sites in Iraq. France, Russia and
China are worried about "hidden triggers" in the wording of the
resolution that would allow the U.S. to launch a strike, overthrow
Hussein and argue later that it had U.N. authorization.</TE>

said Kedah's chief minister, Syed Razak Syed Zain.</LD>
<LD>   "The objective is to monitor the speeches delivered and to enable
the religious department to investigate public complaints that some
imams are reading speeches that slam the government," Syed Razak was
quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama.</LD>

<HD>Turkish Vote Gives Rise to Speculation</HD>
<DH>Observers wonder how the leader of an Islamic party who is
banned from parliament will try to take power in the secular nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>The most powerful politician in Turkey grew up selling sesame buns in
the dingy alleys of Istanbul.</LD>
<LD>   There's a scrappy defiance to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a kind of
streetwise charm that makes his supporters passionate and his enemies
vengeful. Friends and foes were visible Sunday when Erdogan's Justice
and Development Party, known as the AKP, swept to power in Turkey's
national elections. The party, which has Islamic roots, will control
the 550-seat parliament, a rarity in a secular nation accustomed to
faltering coalitions.</LD>
<LD>   Erdogan, the architect and front man of the overwhelming victory,
is happy.</LD>
<TE>   And unfulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan is the leader of the AKP, but he's been banned from
serving in parliament because of a 1998 conviction for Islamic
sedition. That means the former professional soccer player can't
become prime minister. Intrigue is thick in Ankara, the capital, as
politicians and analysts speculate how Erdogan -- never one to give
up -- will get what he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Many are also wondering which Erdogan will emerge. For many of his
47 years, Erdogan has been a devoted Islamist, quoting the Koran and
giving fiery speeches about political Islam. As mayor of Istanbul, he
banned alcohol in cafes and opposed Turkey's attempts to join the
European Union. He was often quoted as saying: "My frame of reference
is Islam."</TE>
<TE>   That endeared him to the clerics but not the generals, protectors
of the nation's secular constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan's AKP never mentions Islam. There is no flicker of
religious imagery. The party's success was due to its ability to ride
voter anger over the nation's corrupt government. With Turkey's
$200-billion national debt and its 20% unemployment rate, the AKP
campaigned on pocketbooks, not prayer beads.</TE>
<TE>   That strategy was furthered Monday when Bulent Ecevit, humiliated
by the trouncing of his Democratic Left Party, resigned as prime
minister. He will stay on as caretaker. The AKP is expected to
nominate a prime minister by Wednesday. Although he has no government
portfolio, Erdogan is planning to meet the leaders of Greece and
other European nations soon.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish secularists and Western countries are curious about the
AKP's ultimate agenda. So far, party officials have espoused an
eloquent pro-Western platform. Many analysts believe that the AKP
will not attempt to extract Turkey from its North Atlantic Treaty
Organization commitments or from future action in any United
Nations-sanctioned war against Iraq. If it did, Western diplomats
say, it would raise the ire of the Turkish military, which in 1997
forced an Islamic party from power.</TE>
<TE>   The military cannot appear too aggressive with the AKP -- that
stance could damage Turkey's chances of getting into the European
Union and enrage an electorate that gave the AKP a clear mandate.
Federal prosecutors have been filing briefs to sideline Erdogan. They
want to force him from the AKP leadership, saying that he has too
often stirred religion into politics and that he will manipulate the
government from the fringes.</TE>
<TE>   "Erdogan will remain fully in control," said Rusen Cakir, an
expert on political Islam. "The results of Sunday's election will
make it difficult for the judiciary to pursue him because his
legitimacy has been endorsed by the Turkish people. Of course, this
is Turkey, and anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, U.S. officials insisted that they are not concerned
about the party's Islamist roots.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to working closely and constructively with the
new government," said Richard Boucher, the chief State Department
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, one U.S. official acknowledged that the party is
wary of a war against Iraq and may not be willing to provide military
support if the United States fails to win a U.N. mandate.</TE>
<TE>   Mark R. Parris, former U.S. ambassador to Turkey, said the
election of the party is "a complicating factor that the [Bush]
administration would probably have preferred not to have to deal with
at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he said he believes that Turkey would probably
cooperate with the United States if the administration decided to
attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The AKP won 34% of the vote, giving it an estimated 362 seats in
parliament. The only other party to enter parliament is the
Republican People's Party, or CHP, with about 180 seats. Independents
have eight seats. The favorite choice for prime minister appears to
be the AKP's Abdullah Gul, a charismatic legislator with a shrewd
understanding of the West. He is the most qualified, but he may be
too strong a force for Erdogan.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts envision two possible scenarios in coming months. In the
first, Erdogan would win a court case exonerating him in the sedition
case. The AKP would call new elections, and he would run for
parliament and subsequently be named prime minister. In the second,
the AKP would rally the necessary 367 votes to amend the constitution
to allow a person not in parliament, such as Erdogan, to become prime
minister.</TE>
<TE>   "The logic says this will happen," said Cuneyt Ulsever, a writer
for the daily Hurriyet who has covered Erdogan for 10 years. "He's
got the call of the wild. He smells what power means, and he is aware
of how to balance that power. He knows to survive he must stay on
good terms with the military, business and the secularists. I don't
know if his religious beliefs have changed, but he's wise enough not
to show them."</TE>
<TE>   Like Turkey itself, Erdogan, with a past steeped in Islam and a
future promised to Europe, straddles two worlds. Because Turkey
forbids the wearing of Muslim head scarves in public buildings,
Erdogan sent his two daughters to Indiana University. Many of the
professionals on his staff were educated in the West.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not a party based on religion," he says, miffed at
spending time on what the party is not, instead of what it is.</TE>
<TE>   Ulsever, who has known Erdogan for years, said: "This is the first
time in the world that we have a chance to marry Islam with liberal
democracy."</TE>

<HD>CIA Missile in Yemen Kills 6 Terror Suspects</HD>
<DH>Unmanned plane fires at car carrying alleged Al Qaeda
operatives, marking an aggressive shift in the Bush administration's
tactics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A missile fired from an unmanned CIA surveillance
aircraft over Yemen killed six suspected Al Qaeda operatives,
including one of the terrorist network's most senior figures -- a man
the United States had hunted for years, U.S. officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The strike represented a sharp escalation in tactics in the Bush
administration's war on terrorism, demonstrating for the first time
that the United States is willing to launch military-style assaults
on Al Qaeda members far from the theater of war in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   The principal target in the attack Sunday was Qaed Sinan Harithi,
a Yemeni who intelligence officials said was among the top 12 figures
in Al Qaeda. He was a key suspect in the bombings of the U.S.
destroyer Cole off Yemen in 2000 that killed 17 U.S. sailors and of a
French tanker last month.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush did not directly address the incident Monday but
reiterated that he is determined to eliminate Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to treat them is [as] what they are -- international
killers," Bush said during a campaign stop in Arkansas. "And the only
way to find them is to be patient, and steadfast, and hunt them down.
And the United States of America is doing just that," he said. "We're
in it for the long haul."</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld made it clear that the United
States was pleased with the outcome of the attack, although he
declined to discuss details.</TE>
<TE>   Harithi "has been sought after as an Al Qaeda member, as well as a
suspected terrorist connected to the USS Cole," Rumsfeld said. "So it
would be a very good thing if he were out of business."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials declined to comment on the bombing, except to
say that the U.S. military was not involved. CIA officials also
refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials who spoke on condition that they not be
identified confirmed that the strike was carried out by a CIA-run
Predator aircraft, a surveillance drone armed with Hellfire antitank
missiles.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was said to have occurred in a rugged area in northern
Yemen, an impoverished Arabian Peninsula nation long considered a
haven for Islamic militants before it was reluctantly drawn into the
campaign against Al Qaeda after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Some news reports from Yemen cited witnesses who said there was a
secondary explosion after the vehicle was hit, indicating it may have
been packed with explosives. Television footage from the scene showed
little more than a charred patch of earth. An Interior Ministry
official told Yemen's Saba news agency that weapons, traces of
explosives and communications equipment were found in the wreckage of
the car the men were driving in Marib province.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence officials said Harithi was the highest-ranking
Al Qaeda figure in Yemen, a onetime bodyguard to Osama bin Laden who
had risen rapidly in the ranks of the organization. Yemen is Bin
Laden's ancestral home.</TE>
<TE>   Yemeni authorities are said to have detained or expelled dozens of
Al Qaeda figures after the Sept. 11 attacks. But much of the nation
remains lawless, particularly along barren stretches of the
Yemen-Saudi Arabia border dominated by powerful tribes.</TE>
<TE>   CIA-operated Predator planes have reportedly been patrolling this
territory in recent months, tracking the movements of Al Qaeda
figures. A U.S. counter-terrorism official confirmed Monday that
authorities have been monitoring Harithi's movements for some time.</TE>
<TE>   A former senior FBI official said that Harithi, also known as Abu
Ali, was Al Qaeda's chief of operations in Yemen even before the Cole
bombing, and that he had risen in prominence in the terror network in
recent years. Intelligence officials said he had not been linked to
the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Harithi had been an associate of Bin Laden since
the early 1990s, when Al Qaeda was headquartered in Sudan. "The FBI
has been trying to get him for years," one official said.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence and counter-terrorism officials said the attack
marked a bare-knuckled turn in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, U.S. authorities have not executed military-style
attacks on top Al Qaeda personnel anywhere in the world except in war
zones in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the United States launched a cruise missile attack on
what was believed to be Bin Laden's headquarters in Afghanistan in
the aftermath of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa that
killed 224 people.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the effort against Al Qaeda has depended largely
on U.S. partnerships with other governments' security services in
raids and other missions aimed primarily at capturing terrorist
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   The top Al Qaeda figure in captivity, Abu Zubeida, was captured in
Pakistan this year in a raid led by Pakistani special police working
with teams from the FBI. More recently, Ramzi Binalshibh, suspected
of being a key player in the Sept. 11 plot, was captured in a raid in
the Pakistani port city of Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the intelligence community questioned Monday why the CIA
had killed Harithi rather than seeking to capture and interrogate
him. Some wondered whether it represented a new mind-set in the Al
Qaeda hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "It means the rules of engagement have changed," said a former CIA
official familiar with special operations. "That would be the first
time that they have started doing this kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Others said, however, that the CIA simply may not have been in a
position to nab Harithi and seized an opportunity to kill him rather
than risk allowing him to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Predators were armed with missiles specifically for such
scenarios. The aircraft was outfitted with Hellfires several years
ago after an unarmed Predator patrolling Afghanistan spotted a figure
intelligence officials believed was Bin Laden. With no means of
launching a missile on such short notice, the person got away.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator and its laser-guided weapons emerged as stars of the
war in Afghanistan. The plane was a critical surveillance tool used
to track movements of Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, and took part in
high-profile bombings.</TE>
<TE>   One strike destroyed an Al Qaeda leadership compound near Kabul,
the Afghan capital. Another later in the war was said to have struck
a tall figure in white robes, prompting speculation that Bin Laden
may have been hit. Officials later said it wasn't the Al Qaeda
leader.</TE>
<TE>   The Predator also can provide live video, infrared and radar
pictures from hundreds of miles away without putting a person into
the line of fire.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Force also operates a fleet of Predators. Bush's 2003
budget allocates $158 million for the military to buy 22 more of the
aircraft -- first used in Kosovo -- and upgrade existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials declined to say whether the Yemeni government
granted permission for the operation, or was even aware of it
beforehand. The attack is likely to inflame anti-American sentiment
in Yemen, where there is widespread sympathy for Al Qaeda. The
country was long seen as an obstacle in the effort against Bin
Laden's network, with U.S. officials saying Yemen offered little
cooperation in the investigation of the Cole bombing or other efforts
to uncover terrorist plots.</TE>
<TE>   Although Yemen was drawn reluctantly into the campaign against
terrorism, it has emerged as a significant U.S. ally. This year, the
United States spent a month and a half training 50 to 100 members of
the Yemeni military in counter-terrorism tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said they had hoped the circumstances
surrounding the attack would remain vague partly to keep Al Qaeda
guessing about U.S. tactics, but also to avoid embarrassing the
Yemeni government. Yemeni officials also were reluctant to confirm
the U.S. role in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want that to get out because some of their citizens
were killed," one counter-terrorism official said. "The reality is
that the Yemeni government cooperated in this; it could not have been
done without them."*</TE>

<HD>Cigarettes Portrayed as Currency of Crime</HD>
<DH>EU suit against R.J. Reynolds describes a worldwide system
of money laundering.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael A. Hiltzik and Henry Weinstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once a month for many years, a group of travelers bribed their way
into Colombia via a remote border crossing from Venezuela, met with
their contacts and then bribed their way home, the better to leave no
record of the trip in their passports.</LD>
<LD>   The illicit commodity they were trading was not cocaine, as might
be expected, but cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   So contends a lawsuit filed last week in a U.S. court by the
European Union. According to the suit, the clandestine travelers were
employees of companies affiliated with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
Their goal, the EU says, was to receive cash for their products
without revealing that the source of the money was the narcotics
trade.</LD>
<TE>   These and a host of similar allegations are at the heart of the EU
suit, which maintains that Reynolds, the world's second-largest
tobacco company, has been complicit for years in a worldwide
money-laundering system in which cigarettes are as important a
currency as the U.S. greenback.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that black-market cigarettes can cause big problems
isn't new. According to some health and law enforcement officials, as
many as a third of all cigarette exports wind up being sold on the
black market, cheating governments of tax revenue and encouraging
smoking by keeping cheap cigarettes available. U.S. states with high
tobacco taxes find themselves similarly victimized by cigarette
smugglers.</TE>
<TE>   But the EU suit adds a fresh twist to the concept of cigarette
smuggling that goes way beyond simple tax evasion. The allegations,
say money-laundering experts here and abroad, underscore the role
that cigarettes -- ubiquitous, easily transportable commodities
usually bought and sold for cash -- have come to play in lubricating
the movement of capital for drug traffickers, tax evaders, terrorists
and others who need to conceal the sources of their funding.</TE>
<TE>   "This complaint has described, chapter and verse, a blatant
conspiracy," said Charles Intriago, a Miami lawyer and publisher of
the newsletter Money Laundering Alert.</TE>
<TE>   The EU's lawsuit, filed last Thursday in federal court in
Brooklyn, N.Y., links Reynolds with money-laundering networks serving
not only Latin America but also Italy, Spain, Russia, the Balkans,
Britain and Iraq -- where it is allegedly overseen by Saddam
Hussein's son, Uday Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   It also alleges that cigarettes were at the center of the infamous
Bank of New York money-laundering case of 2000, in which two top bank
executives have pleaded guilty to helping launder billions of dollars
for organized crime figures in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   In copious detail, the suit describes stratagems RJR allegedly
employed to distance itself from criminal partners, including
eradicating identification numbers from illicit shipments, using
secret bank accounts and third-party checks and establishing
intermediary companies through which to do business.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Reynolds spokesman Seth Moskowitz reiterated the
company's position that "any allegations we were involved in, or
aware of, money laundering, conspiracy or other illegal activities is
completely absurd."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds officials also have noted that the U.S.-based RJR Tobacco
companies currently have no international operations. The companies'
parent, RJR Nabisco, sold its foreign distribution business in 1999
to Japan Tobacco Inc., which is majority-owned by the Japanese
government.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, RJR has pointed out that many of the allegations
mirror those in a lawsuit the EU brought against the company in 2000.
That case was dismissed by a federal judge in February on grounds
that its claim of European tax evasion by RJR lay outside the
jurisdiction of U.S. courts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, experts in tobacco litigation say last week's EU lawsuit --
which is designed to supplant the one that was dismissed -- opens a
new front in the courtroom war against Big Tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   In June, a federal jury in Charlotte, N.C., convicted two Lebanese
brothers of participating in an illegal multimillion-dollar operation
to smuggle low-tax cigarettes out of North Carolina and to divert
some of the profits to Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group that was
blamed for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Lebanon
that killed 241 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   But the EU case, notably, is aimed not at the smugglers but at the
tobacco industry.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the most serious and far-reaching allegations ever made
against any domestic U.S. corporation," said David Vladeck, a law
professor at Georgetown University and director of the Public Citizen
Litigation Group, which has represented public health groups in
lawsuits against the tobacco industry. "According to this complaint,
RJR is at the nerve center of an enormous international operation
that has far-reaching and detrimental impacts throughout the U.S.,
Western Europe and South America."</TE>
<TE>   Vladeck said that the stature of the plaintiffs lends credibility
to the charges. "Remember, these are not individuals making these
allegations. These are the nations of Belgium, Spain, Italy ...
foreign sovereigns."</TE>
<TE>   If the allegations are true, Vladeck added, they would raise
serious questions for U.S. officials. "If RJR cigarettes really are
the currency of international money-laundering rings," he asked, "how
did this escape the attention of the U.S. government?"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most striking are the allegations the EU makes about RJR's
relationship with a Russian money-laundering network that funneled
billions of dollars in illicit transfers through the Bank of New York
in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Those transfers sparked one of the largest money-laundering
investigations in history and in February 2000 led to guilty pleas to
federal charges by Lucy Edwards, a Russian-born Bank of New York
executive, and her husband, Peter Berlin. (Neither has been sentenced
and both are said to be cooperating with authorities.)</TE>
<TE>   But that investigation was premised on the assumption that the
transfers were principally aimed at evading Russian taxes and
spiriting capital out of the foundering country. Before the EU's
suit, the transactions were never before tied to cigarette smuggling
or to any other aspects of the tobacco trade, experts familiar with
the case said.</TE>
<TE>   "Cigarettes did not form a basis to the charges to which Berlin
and Edwards pleaded and were not part of the charges by the
government," said T. Barry Kingham, the couple's New York attorney.
He said, however, he has not been privy to the couple's subsequent
debriefings by federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union, however, labels RJR subsidiaries the "prime
beneficiaries" of the money-laundering system set up by Russian
mobsters through the Bank of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit cites, for example, a string of transfers to R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco International totaling more than $4 million from May
through July of 1997. The transfers were ordered by Sinex Bank, which
was incorporated the previous year in the Pacific Island of Nauru,
then a known money haven, by Russian traders eager to spirit their
capital out of Russia. They were then routed through the Bank of New
York via another correspondent bank and ultimately to RJR, the EU
contends.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union maintains that this method of payment should
have raised RJR's suspicions that its buyers were not legitimate
businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   "No legitimate purchaser of cigarettes would be ordering payment
... through Sinex Bank," the complaint states. Further, it alleges,
the invoices received for the cigarettes named Sinex, a tiny bank
operating offshore, as the "ordering customer" -- a scenario so
unlikely that it should have alerted RJR that Sinex was masking the
identity of the true customers.</TE>
<TE>   The EU suit alleges other, more immediate, contacts between RJR
officials and drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   In October 1992, it says, John Dyson, whom the complaint
identifies as RJR Tobacco International's Miami-based Latin America
sales manager, "traveled to Aruba to establish direct contacts
between RJR distributors and Colombian narcotics money-laundering
organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Dyson, the EU says, arranged for RJR's Aruba distributor to sell
cigarettes to a Spanish company that would pay with the proceeds of
narcotics sales collected in Medellin, Colombia, the base of one of
the era's most notorious cocaine cartels.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement was so delicate, the complaint alleges, that the
Aruba distributor warned Dyson that RJR would be charged for the
"additional costs" of handling drug money.</TE>
<TE>   The RJR spokesman declined to comment on the allegation or to
confirm whether Dyson was now or ever had been employed by the
company. Dyson could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, the EU complaint does not make clear whether Dyson
knew that the ultimate source of payment to RJR was drug money. Legal
experts say making that final connection may be the European Union's
hardest task.</TE>
<TE>   "The Achilles' heel of the complaint, if there is one, is that the
plaintiffs have to prove that RJR was doing more than selling
cigarettes to anyone who would buy them," said Georgetown
University's Vladeck. "The one thing that is crucial here -- and will
be highly contested by the corporation and may prove difficult to
establish in court -- is that RJR knew its cigarettes were being used
as the currency for international drug trafficking and money
laundering."</TE>
<TE>   The EU complaint does argue, however, that RJR's distribution
deals with illicit partners differed materially from those with
legitimate distributors, an indication that the company may have made
the distinction.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping companies hired by RJR in Belgium and elsewhere, the
complaint alleges, were given special handling instructions for
customers that RJR knew were "involved in criminal activities." These
allegedly included special fax numbers for invoices and specific RJR
employees permitted to handle shipment documents, as well as the use
of numbered bank accounts that could not easily be traced to RJR. In
some cases, the suit alleges, RJR repeatedly changed the banks
through which it received payment to evade detection by the U.S.
government -- a process the EU says was known within the company as
"musical banks."</TE>
<TE>   Other instructions included orders that the master cases --
containers of 10,000 cigarettes each -- should be "neutralized and
decoded," meaning that marks and numbers allowing the containers to
be traced and tracked should be removed, the suit alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also contends that RJR and its co-conspirators used "an
organized group of money couriers whose function was to receive
criminal proceeds in Italy and other parts of the European Union and
to illegally ferry those proceeds out of Italy and the European
Community to Switzerland, where the couriers would hand the cash
proceeds" to Swiss money-laundering organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the suit alleges that throughout the 1990s, RJR
employees traveled to the warehouses of criminal organizations to
inspect cigarettes, "ensure freshness, replace damaged goods, and
provide other services for these criminal organizations just as they
would any other customer."</TE>
<TE>   RJR, the European Union maintains, "knew, or but for their willful
blindness would have known, that their customers were organized
criminal organizations."</TE>

<CX>   Cigarette smuggling -- A story in Section A on Tuesday incorrectly
said R.J. Reynolds is the world's second-largest tobacco company. It
is the second largest in the United States. In a related story in the
Business section Tuesday, the revenue rule, a common law doctrine
that originated in the 1700s, was incorrectly described as dating to
the 17th century.</CX>

<HD>Limping to the Finish Line</HD>
<DH>Record-low turnout is predicted after Californians endure
relentless negative ads in eight-month general election campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assaulted and unsettled, millions of Californians head to the polls
today to pick a governor, decide whether Los Angeles will cleave
itself into parts and express their views on issues ranging from
local growth to statewide transportation.</LD>
<LD>   The two leading candidates for governor -- Democratic incumbent
Gray Davis and Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr. -- led a small
army of candidates who swarmed the state Monday to rally their most
fervent followers -- and perhaps sway a fence-sitter here or there.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got a water crisis," Simon said at a stop in the Imperial
Valley. "We've got an electricity crisis. We have a road crisis. We
have a health-care crisis."</LD>
<TE>   Davis, who touched down in San Francisco, Fresno and Los Angeles,
assailed Simon as too extreme for live-and-let-live Californians. "We
are moving this state forward," Davis exclaimed at a midday
appearance at San Francisco's Union Square. "And with your help,
we'll continue to move it forward, not backwards, as Mr. Simon wants
to do."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the two sides in the secession battle pressed
their respective cases by hitting neighborhoods in Hollywood and the
San Fernando Valley with precinct-walkers and a final wave of
targeted phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, the television airwaves crackled with round-the-clock
advertising, much of it negative, capping a relentless barrage that
has left many Californians feeling more weary than inspired.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-month general election campaign, which started with the
moved-up primary, is the longest California has endured and could end
in a record-low turnout.</TE>
<TE>   Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and voters can find
their polling place by visiting www.smartvoter.org..</TE>
<TE>   The secretary of state forecast a 58% turnout, with roughly 9
million of the registered voters casting ballots. That would match
the low four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts were predicting an even lower turnout, given
widespread distaste for the gubernatorial hopefuls -- polls found up
to two-thirds of voters wanting other choices -- and anxieties over
the economy, terrorism and scandals tainting everything from
corporate America to the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   Many candidates helped contribute to that malaise with the
bludgeoning tone of their campaigns, analysts said. "This election
has never been about solving problems," said Darry Sragow, a
Democratic strategist involved in more than a half dozen Assembly
races. "It's all about who's the lesser of the evils."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the contest for governor, Californians will vote on
seven other statewide offices, including open seats for controller,
insurance commissioner, secretary of state and superintendent of
public instruction. All 80 seats in the state Assembly are up for
grabs -- at least in theory -- along with half the 40 seats in the
state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats were virtually certain to keep control of the
Legislature, thanks to the status quo plan worked out by state
lawmakers when they redrew California's political boundaries. As a
result of that deal, fewer than 10 of the 100 legislative races on
today's ballot are competitive.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamic is similar in races for the House of Representatives.
The state will gain a seat in Congress thanks to population growth
through the 1990s, bringing California's biggest-in-the-nation
delegation to 53.</TE>
<TE>   But only one of those contests is considered close: the race to
replace Rep. Gary Condit in the Central Valley. Democrat Dennis
Cardoza of Atwater is favored over Republican Dick Monteith of
Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   Both parties were hoping for upsets in House races elsewhere in
the state, but the most likely outcome is a single-seat gain for
Democrats, boosting their partisan advantage in Washington to 33-20.</TE>
<TE>   Voters also will decide on seven statewide ballot measures,
dealing with issues ranging from housing to water quality to the
physical condition of California's public schools.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the measures would circumscribe state spending, continuing
a trend of budgeting via the ballot box. The first, guaranteeing a
portion of funds for after-school programs, is widely seen as a
political test run for actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who
is leading the campaign for Proposition 49 while eyeing a bid for
governor.</TE>
<TE>   The second, Proposition 51, would permanently shift some motor
vehicle sales taxes from the state's general fund to pay for
transportation projects.</TE>
<TE>   Voters also will face local issues, from measures putting more
cops on the streets of Oakland to a Berkeley initiative mandating the
sale of earth-friendly coffee beans.</TE>
<TE>   Topping it all is the race for governor, a contest that has
consumed tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of hours of TV air
time without ever seeming to capture the imagination of Californians.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has struggled for more than a year with mediocre approval
ratings stemming from his widely criticized handling of the
electricity crisis and his aggressive fund-raising practices.</TE>
<TE>   Even before he took office, Davis set a goal of $50 million for
his reelection, and he easily surpassed that by raising close to $70
million. He sunk the biggest chunk into negative TV ads, starting in
last winter's GOP primary when he intervened to undermine the
front-running Richard Riordan and boost Simon, his preferred
opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Once Simon prevailed, Davis launched a brutal series of ads
attacking the businessman and rookie candidate as ethically shady and
ideologically extreme. The negative assault did little to endear
voters to Davis. But it scuffed Simon's image so much that polls at
the end of the campaign found him even less popular than the
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Davis' biggest concern is low voter turnout, and he
exhorted his supporters to defy the forecasts of rampant
disengagement. "We Democrats understand that voting is an act of
patriotism," Davis said Monday to a crowd of several hundred San
Francisco supporters. "We turn out the vote!"</TE>
<TE>   The governor, traveling the state with a full complement of
Democratic office-seekers, forecast a party sweep of the statewide
ticket, for the first time in more than 50 years. Among those hoping
to make it happen was Gary Donnelly, who showed up for the governor's
San Francisco rally.</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old welder from Michigan, who is homeless and
unemployed, said he came to the rally in one of 14 vans of people
recruited from homeless shelters, soup kitchens and other aid
centers. "I've been Democrat all my life," said Donnelly, wearing a
pair of Davis campaign signs on his head to shield the bright autumn
sun.</TE>
<TE>   Others in the crowd said they, too, were promised $200 -- or $50 a
day -- by the state Democratic Party to distribute campaign fliers
and knock on doors from Saturday through today.</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Marshall, 51, who had the weathered look of a life lived
on the streets, said he was receiving free meals in addition to his
$50 stipend.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's handpicked opponent, Simon, was something of an
accidental aspirant. His strategists expected him to lose the March
primary to Riordan, building name recognition along the way for some
future campaign. Instead, he seized the GOP nomination with no
general election strategy and little support from his own party
establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's problems were compounded by a general election campaign
team racked with internal disputes and continued tensions with the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   He struggled with controversies over his taxes, a fraud verdict
against his family investment firm -- later overturned -- and a
flip-flop over his gay-rights position. Perhaps most damaging was a
false attack on Davis' fund-raising practices, which undercut Simon's
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for all his many missteps, Simon remained within hailing
distance at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning Monday from the Imperial Valley to the Los Angeles
suburbs, Simon predicted a late election night, as he repeatedly
urged his backers to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on the verge of victory," Simon told about 100 cheering
supporters at the Ontario Mills outlet mall. "We are confident we are
going to put it across, but we need you to get out and vote."</TE>
<TE>   With polls finding many undecided voters, Simon scheduled an
unusual pair of election day events, a stop in Fullerton and a final
rally in San Diego. "We're going to campaign until the last minute,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happens, both candidates will end up limping past the
finish line. In addition to a low turnout, opinion surveys suggested
there could be a record showing for minor-party candidates.</TE>

<HD>Leader's Militancy Led to Denunciation as a Fanatic</HD>
<DH>Supporters saw Rubin as a courageous if unpolished leader
while mainstream Jews criticized him as being on the fringe.</DH>

<LD>Irv Rubin once offered a $500 reward to anyone who killed a member of
the American Nazi Party. He proudly brawled with Ku Klux Klansmen on
television, and publicly celebrated the murder of a prominent Arab
American.</LD>
<LD>   The militant chairman of the Jewish Defense League spent a
lifetime waging a belligerent crusade against those he perceived as
anti-Semitic. His tactics and means led him to be denounced as a
hatemonger himself.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, Rubin, 56, was arrested more than 40 times, by his
own account, most recently for allegedly conspiring to bomb a Culver
City mosque and the office of an Arab American congressman from San
Diego County.</LD>
<TE>   His extreme views are reflected in the JDL's slogans: "For every
Jew a .22" and "Keep Jews alive with a .45."</TE>
<TE>   But this volatile man fought a solitary cause since he took the
helm of the JDL in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Mainstream Jewish leaders roundly denounced Rubin as a fanatic, a
thug and a hooligan.</TE>
<TE>   The JDL, whose membership has dwindled to the point where may it
now number only a few dozen, has been branded a hate group by
organizations within and outside the Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   "We consider him on the fringe," said Sue Stengel, Western States
counsel for the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish civil rights
group. "He has made it his business to be an agitator ... I think to
the detriment of the general Jewish community."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin had long maintained that he fought for a righteous cause,
even if his methods were unconventional and frowned upon by others.</TE>
<TE>   When Rubin succeeded JDL founder Rabbi Meir Kahane, who was later
gunned down in New York, he said that he would press forward with the
organization's original mandate "to eliminate any threat to Jewish
people" with a forceful, two-pronged attack on anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   "Priority 1 will be to teach every Jew or sympathetic Gentile
self-defense," Rubin said in 1985. "Priority No. 2 is that wherever
the neo-Nazis rear their heads, we will be there to confront them,
eyeball to eyeball. The day of the submissive Jew must be
eliminated."</TE>
<TE>   To his few supporters, Rubin was a courageous if unpolished figure
who cared deeply about the security of Jews in the United States and
Israel. They point out that Rubin flew to Israel immediately after
the start of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and served in the civilian
defense corps. He also ran an unsuccessful campaign for state
Assembly in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Rubin's wife of 21 years, Shelley, struggled over news
that her husband had been described as brain dead.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a fighter," she said. "He wouldn't give up. And he was a
good father and good husband. So he wouldn't do what they said he
did."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Rubin attempted suicide while in federal custody
awaiting trial on charges that he and JDL associate Earl Krugel
plotted the bombing of the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, the
Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles and a field office of
U.S. Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), who is of Arab descent.</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury indicted the two JDL leaders in January.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's lawyers called the charges overblown and said that he was
the target of a vendetta by government lawyers who have failed to win
convictions against him in other criminal cases, including the
unsolved 1985 bombing death in Santa Ana of Alex Odeh, West Coast
director of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin, who was named as a suspect in that case but never charged,
denied involvement, even as he welcomed Odeh's killing.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Extortion Probe</TE>
<TE>   Arguing government bias, Rubin's lawyers also cited a three-year
FBI probe into unsubstantiated allegations that the JDL participated
in a scheme to extort money from the late rap stars Tupac Shakur and
Eazy-E through death threats. Rubin's lawyers asked prosecutors to
turn over records of the FBI inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Rubin's attorneys had asked that his Nov. 12 trial be
severed from Krugel's for fear that racist comments by his friend
caught on tape by investigators would prejudice jurors against him.</TE>
<TE>   The roots of Rubin's crusade trace back to his childhood in
Montreal, Canada. It was there that Rubin first experienced
anti-Semitism, according to a biography on the JDL Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The biography says that hotel owners and other businesspeople hung
signs reading "No Dogs or Jews Allowed" on their doors and
schoolchildren taunted him because he was Jewish.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's family settled in Los Angeles when he was 15. Rubin
attended Granada Hills High School, where he was president of the
Republican Club before graduating in the early 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   He eventually became a U.S. citizen and enlisted in the Air Force,
serving four years and earning the rank of sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   Meir Kahane Lecture</TE>
<TE>   Then, in 1971, Rubin heard Kahane speak at Cal State Northridge.
The young man was enthralled with Kahane's message of Jewish
resistance and the JDL motto: "Never Again," a reference to the
Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin hooked up with Kahane and within months was appointed the
JDL's West Coast coordinator. In succeeding Kahane as national
chairman, Rubin proved himself an enthusiastic leader who was able to
consistently draw media attention with his outrageous comments,
televised brawls and repeated run-ins with law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Even before he assumed the mantle, Rubin showed a penchant for
militancy.</TE>
<TE>   He was charged with attempted murder in 1972 after shots were
fired into the home of a local neo-Nazi with whom he fought before a
television interview. Charges were later dismissed for lack of
evidence. Six years later, he was charged with solicitation of murder
after offering $500 during a news conference to anyone who killed or
injured a member of the American Nazi Party. He was later acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   After the 1999 shooting by a white supremacist at the Jewish
Community Center in Granada Hills, thousands of people came together
to speak out against violence. Rubin showed up, too, interrupting
Gov. Gray Davis' speech with shouts against gun control and in favor
of armed self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Membership Dwindled</TE>
<TE>   Those who monitor extremism say that the influence of the JDL
waned dramatically since he took command and that the organization,
which initially garnered some mainstream support for its championing
of the rights of Soviet Jews, suffered from his excesses.</TE>
<TE>   "If he would have extended his energy on more positive pursuits,
he might have really accomplished something," said David Lehrer,
former West Coast director of the Anti-Defamation League. "It's
unfortunate that it came to this."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Rubin and his organization are lumped into the same
camp as the very hate groups he fought.</TE>
<TE>   The JDL fist-and-star logo appears on the Web site of the Center
for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino,
right next to other hate graphics belonging to the Aryan Nations and
the Ku Klux Klan.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what he did was media sideshow antics -- getting into
tussles with white supremacists, " said Brian Levin, director of the
San Bernardino center. "He never was accepted by any of the
mainstream civil rights, anti-hate or Jewish organizations. They all
categorically disowned any association with him and rightly so. He's
an extremist."</TE>

<HD>Jewish Radical Irv Rubin Gravely Injured in Jail</HD>
<DH>Authorities call an 18-foot plunge a suicide attempt; the
JDL chief is said to be 'brain dead.'</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Irv Rubin, the bombastic Jewish Defense League leader who was
arrested last year for allegedly conspiring to blow up a mosque, was
gravely injured Monday when he plunged over a railing in a federal
detention center and fell about 18 feet to a cellblock below.
Authorities characterized it as a suicide attempt.</LD>
<LD>   Rubin had tried slashing his throat with a jail-issue safety razor
immediately before the fall, federal officials said. After guards
spotted him, he went over the railing, according to William Woolsey,
spokesman for the U.S. Marshal's office in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred early Monday morning, shortly before Rubin
was to be taken to a hearing in U.S. District Court. By late
afternoon, he was described by defense lawyer Peter Morris as "brain
dead and on life support" at County-USC Medical Center.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin's wife, Shelley, insisted that her husband, an outspoken and
controversial figure in the Jewish radical movement in Los Angeles
for more than 30 years, had been in good spirits and would never have
violated Jewish law by taking his own life.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a full investigation because he was murdered," Shelley
Rubin said in an interview at the couple's duplex in Monrovia, still
festively decorated for Halloween. Although Rubin was still
technically alive at that point, she referred to him as "gone."</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't the kind of person to take his own life," she added. "I
want to know who did this to him."</TE>
<TE>   However, attorney Mark Werksman, who represents Rubin's
co-defendant, Earl Krugel, said he and his client were certain that
Rubin had been in a downward psychological spiral for months.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a physical and mental wreck since this case started,"
Werksman said. "He probably lost 40 pounds in recent months. And he
was overwhelmed by the pressure of this case and the prospect of
facing life in prison."</TE>
<TE>   "The jailers probably should have kept an eye on him," Werksman
added. "But nobody would have thought this would happen. He's such a
fighter. Who would guess that he would give up like this?"</TE>
<TE>   Rubin and Krugel, his chief lieutenant in the JDL, were arrested
by the FBI last December for allegedly plotting to blow up the King
Fahd Mosque in Culver City and the office of a Lebanese American
congressman, Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista). Rubin pleaded not
guilty, as did Krugel.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew had been planning to consider
several defense motions Monday, including a request by Rubin's
lawyers to sever his case from Krugel's, and another to allow the
defense to claim government bias. The case was scheduled to go to
trial in January.</TE>
<TE>   The JDL, which Rubin joined in 1971 and had led since 1985, was
never more than a fringe organization, although one that commanded
attention through its brash and sometimes violent behavior. By the
time of his arrest last December, it appeared to be a spent force,
its vitality sapped in part by the departure, and the 1990
assassination, of founder Meir Kahane. By last year, Los Angeles
County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a longtime observer of the group,
could quip that there were more teams in the American League than
there were members of the JDL.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's incident, which was under investigation by the FBI, began
shortly before 5 a.m. when Rubin, like other inmates with court
appearances, was allowed to leave his cell at the Metropolitan
Detention Center in downtown L.A. for breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "He never made it," said Woolsey.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, according to authorities, Rubin left his cell and began
slashing at his throat with the blade from a disposable razor. Guards
spotted him, and were either about to move toward him or had begun to
do so. Before they could grab him, Rubin ran a few feet and plunged
over a rail separating one row of cells from the floor's common area,
authorities said. By several accounts, he fell about 18 feet to a
concrete floor on another row of cells steps below the common area.</TE>
<TE>   No one touched Rubin before he went over the edge, according to
authorities. His injuries were said to be so severe that Rubin was
initially reported to have died early Monday morning while in
surgery, then was reported to be alive but comatose.</TE>
<TE>   While he would not comment on Rubin's apparent suicide attempt,
the detention center's associate warden Bran Hoyt confirmed that the
firebrand activist was in the general population of inmates, who
represent almost 95% of the prison's population of about 1,000. Those
inmates are housed within the middle five floors of the 10-story
correctional center downtown.</TE>
<TE>   As a general population inmate, Rubin would have been required to
share a cell with another prisoner whenever the facility was
particularly crowded, although there were reports on Monday that he
did not have a roommate at the time of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   The razor used in the incident would have been one issued to Rubin
along with other toiletries available to any general population
prisoner, according to detention center officials. Exceptions are
only made when a prisoner has shown he is a threat to himself or
others, Hoyt said. "And that kind of person is normally in a special
housing unit," with much tighter security, he said. Rubin, Hoyt said,
"had been in the general population area for quite a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Rules are similar in county jails, run by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin's wife said she had just arrived home Monday after taking
their 12-year-old son, Kelly, to school, when she received a call
from one of her husband's defense lawyers informing her of Rubin's
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   She said she had visited him for nearly an hour Sunday, and there
was no indication that he was despondent or considering suicide. She
said their conversation focused on her trip to Disneyland with their
son on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't talk that much about the case, but he said to me, 'I'll
see you tomorrow in court,' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   She also blamed Lew, the judge in the case. "This would not have
happened if the judge had not denied bail to my husband."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they found no suicide note.</TE>
<TE>   "Irv was a fighter through and through," said JDL spokesman Brett
Stone. "It's just hard to accept that he would take his own life."</TE>
<TE>   Werksman said, however, that on Friday Rubin said he had been
seeing a psychologist at the prison.</TE>
<TE>   Without discussing the case, Hoyt said that a prisoner's
consultation with a psychologist was not, in itself, an indication
that he posed a threat to himself or others.</TE>

<HD>Vatican Revisions Ease Rule on Reporting Abuse</HD>
<DH>The Catholic Church no longer requires leaders to disclose
'any' sexual wrongdoing, which could open a loophole in 18 states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roman Catholic priests in more than a third of the states could have
significant new leeway on whether to tell authorities about priests
suspected of molesting minors under a revised sex abuse prevention
policy negotiated last week between U.S. bishops and the Vatican.</LD>
<LD>   Church officials on Monday released the full text of the revised
policy, which shows that a potentially significant loophole was added
to a section on reporting priests to civil authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Under the abuse policy approved in June by the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops in Dallas, church leaders would have been required
to report "any" case of sexual abuse to government officials. But
under the latest revisions, bishops would be required to comply only
with "applicable civil laws" on reporting.</LD>
<TE>   Thirty-two states, including California, require clergy either
explicitly or implicitly to report known or suspected child abuse or
neglect. But 18 states have no such reporting requirement, according
to a recent report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.</TE>
<TE>   Church officials on Monday said the change would have little or no
practical effect on the commitment of bishops to report sexual abuse,
but news of the change brought new criticism from advocates for
victims of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "In June they promised to report 'any' allegation to police. Now
they are only promising to 'comply with' civil laws. This is a huge
and shameful retreat from doing what any responsible party should do
to doing what is only required by law," said Mark Serrano of
Leesburg, Va., a spokesman for Survivors Network of those Abused by
Priests.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone from a clear set of common-sense rules back to a
complicated murky set of 'suggestions,' in which bishops have more
discretion and laypeople have less voice," Serrano said.</TE>
<TE>   At least some bishops may wish to take advantage of whatever
leeway the rules allow. During their debate in Dallas over the
policy, several objected to reporting priests for offenses that
happened many years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When we do this, we rat out our priests, and I'm not in favor of
that," Bishop Thomas G. Doran of Rockford, Ill., said during the
debate. The church should investigate allegations of sexual abuse
itself before informing civil authorities, he argued.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop John T. Steinbock of Fresno was among several bishops who
said he worried about having to report wild accusations "from some
crazy person, which we all have in our dioceses."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of bishops, however, said at the time that mandatory
reporting of all cases of sexual abuse of minors was needed to
restore parishioners' confidence in the church.</TE>
<TE>   In another change, the revisions also say the local sexual abuse
review boards that were established in each diocese by the Dallas
policy are to function "as a confidential consultative body" to the
bishop.</TE>
<TE>   The revisions also strike down a Dallas provision requiring those
review boards to report the results of their investigations -- known
as an "assessment" -- to the alleged victims and accused clergy.</TE>
<TE>   After the bishops approved the original policy, the Vatican
objected to what it said were abridgements of the due process rights
of accused priests, an overly broad definition of sexual abuse and a
lack of clarity in the role of the lay-dominated review boards.</TE>
<TE>   A joint eight-member commission, made up of four U.S. bishops and
four Vatican officials, hammered out the revisions last week in
Vatican City. The revisions are scheduled to be voted on next week
when the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops meets in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   As word leaked out last week about the revisions, most attention
was focused on provisions that required a church tribunal to decide
whether a priest or deacon had been guilty of sexually abusing a
minor.</TE>
<TE>   There also was controversy over a revision that, in effect, struck
down the Dallas plan's "zero tolerance" policy of sexual
abuse--"past, present or future." The revisions said the church's
10-year statute of limitations would continue to apply, although it
said bishops could ask for a waiver.</TE>
<TE>   But until the full details were released Monday, little was said
about reporting requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Father Arthur Espelage, a canon lawyer and executive coordinator
for the Canon Law Society of America, said he believes that the
changes would have no effect on the willingness of bishops to report
abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "When the civil law requires you have to report, there's no
problem. When the civil law does not require reporting, then a bishop
can create his own particular ecclesiastical law for his diocese
which requires reporting," Espelage said.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony said Monday that the
change in wording will not affect California, because it has a
reporting law, or his own policy, which is to report all cases "past,
present or future."</TE>
<TE>   "For all practical purposes it makes no difference to us," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mahony said he had not thought about the effect in states with
no clergy reporting requirements. He said he would raise the issue
when the bishops meet in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the revisions involving local review boards would also
have no practical effect in Los Angeles because of the way the board
here operates.</TE>

<HD>Maverick Provided Minnesota a Third-Party Option</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- If Jesse Ventura was the body, Dean Barkley was the
brains.</LD>
<LD>   A lawyer who once took out a $30,000 second mortgage on his house
to pay his campaign bills, Barkley was the maverick candidate who ran
over and over again to put a third party on Minnesota's political
map. In the 1994 Senate race, he got more than 5% of the vote, giving
what is now the Independence Party a claim on public financing. And
in 1996, when he got more than 7% of the vote in the Senate campaign
that reelected Democrat Paul Wellstone, Barkley opened the door for
Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   Jesse "The Body" Ventura, a champion wrestler who became a radio
talk-show host, actor, sports commentator and mayor, stunned everyone
with his gubernatorial victory in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "He was greatly surprised and greatly gratified," Steven Schier, a
political scientist at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., said of
Barkley. "He was the mastermind."</TE>
<TE>   The son of a small-town mayor, Barkley is a Minnesota native.
After earning bachelor's and law degrees from the University of
Minnesota, he ran a retail furniture company, practiced law and
opened a carwash business outside Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the first former carwash operator to be a U.S. senator," he
said after he was appointed by Ventura to fill the seat left vacant
by Wellstone's death.</TE>
<TE>   Married with three children -- stepson, Tim; son, Garrett; and
daughter, Brooke -- Barkley shielded his family from the rigors of
his quixotic campaigns, putting 32,000 miles on a green van in 1996,
at times solo.</TE>
<TE>   But his wife, Susan, is credited with encouraging his
against-the-odds campaigns. "He's in his element doing this," she
told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 1996. "He's so happy when he's
involved in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, 52, was once a Democrat, but he says he "outgrew it."
Galvanized by the 1992 presidential campaign of Reform Party
candidate Ross Perot, he developed a disdain for both major parties,
and for their methods of campaign financing, which he calls legalized
bribery by special interests. "I basically came to the conclusion
that Democrats don't know how to say 'no' to spending. They try to
buy answers," he said. As for the Republicans, he called their
platform "anti-women, anti-gay, anti-choice."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he ran for the Senate in 1996, he was convinced a
third party remained a real option. "I can't understand why the
electorate won't wake up and stop voting for two parties they don't
believe in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A fiscal conservative who hews to the deficit-busting agenda of
the Concord Coalition, Barkley is unlikely, friends say, to favor
making President Bush's tax cuts permanent. And, they add, he is not
expected to favor the more controversial Bush judicial nominations,
since he is a vote for gay rights, abortion rights and civil-service
protections. But he is just as likely to part company with Democrats
on spending.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a decent guy who's been tilting at huge windmills," said
D.J. Leary, co-editor of the newsletter Politics in Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   The state has a long tradition of iconoclastic mavericks. This is
the state whose progressive tradition produced a Farmer-Labor Party,
the perennial presidential candidate Harold E. Stassen and the
antiwar movement's Eugene McCarthy, whose 1968 candidacy doomed
President Johnson's hopes for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Even in a progressive state, the unpredictable Ventura has been a
jolt, and most expect similar surprises from Barkley. "You can find
no point of public difference between them," Schier said. "They share
a scorn for big-money politics as usual."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley agreed to the last-minute appointment ceremony timed to
interrupt the televised two-party debate between Democrat Walter F.
Mondale and Republican Norm Coleman, and Schier thinks he shared
Ventura's anger that the independent candidate, Jim Moore, was
excluded.</TE>
<TE>   But he suspects Barkley will play better in Washington. "He shares
Ventura's resentments, but he doesn't lead with his testosterone," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like that scene in [the movie] 'Animal House' where there's
a good angel on one shoulder and a bad angel on the other," said
Stephen Frank, a political scientist at St. Cloud State University
who co-wrote a biography of Ventura. "Jesse was the bad angel and
Dean was the good one."</TE>

<LD>Less than three months before the Columbine High School massacre, a
juvenile probation officer predicted teen killer Eric Harris likely
would succeed in life.</LD>
<LD>   Harris and Dylan Klebold had been arrested in January 1998 after
allegedly breaking into a van and stealing tools, roughly a year
before they opened fire on their Littleton school. They were ordered
into a juvenile-diversion program, which allows offenders to avoid
jail time and a criminal record through public service or other
options.</LD>
<LD>   In a report released Monday, Harris was described as "a very
bright young man who is likely to succeed in life. He is intelligent
enough to achieve lofty goals as long as he stays on task and remains
motivated."</LD>

<LD>A killer who has been diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic and was said
to be so heavily sedated during his trial that he slept through much
of it awaited execution in a case that could focus new attention on
capital punishment and the mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   James Colburn's lawyers hope the U.S. Supreme Court will stop
Wednesday's execution, which would be Texas' 30th this year. The high
court this year banned the execution of the mentally retarded as
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment, but the justices so
far have refused blanket protection from the death penalty for people
such as Colburn.</LD>
<LD>   Colburn, 42, is set to die by lethal injection for fatally
stabbing a hitchhiker in the throat with a steak knife during an
attempt to rape her at his home in 1994.</LD>

<DL>IONE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A wind-swept little graveyard sits atop a knoll on the Buena Vista
rancheria, a quiet resting place in the Sierra foothills for an
Indian clan that has neared extinction.</LD>
<LD>   Yet this patch of land with its gnarled oaks and golden grass has
been the focus of ferocious machinations on two coasts -- a fight
cementing California's status as the hottest front in the nation's
Indian casino wars.</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, the Buena Vista Miwoks, a band of six adults and
six children, announced plans for a gaming hall on their 67-acre
rancheria. Competition appeared in the form of a young mother, who
claimed the rightful authority to negotiate on the tribe's behalf.</LD>
<TE>   Casino developers and rival tribes jumped into the fray, and along
with them came several top Washington operatives, including Scott W.
Reed, who managed the 1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole, and
Roger Stone, who strategized for George W. Bush during the 2000
presidential recount in Florida. Bush administration officials also
got involved, signaling their interest in the case to a high-level
Interior Department executive, who was fired in the midst of an FBI
inquiry into his role.</TE>
<TE>   The battle for control of the Buena Vista showcases the turmoil
spawned by California's Proposition 1A. Approved by voters in 2000,
the measure granted a monopoly on casino gambling to the state's
federally recognized tribes.</TE>
<TE>   California is home to 108 tribes, one-fifth of the nation's total.
An additional 54 have applied for federal recognition. Many are
located within a few hours' driving distance of urban centers.</TE>
<TE>   The race for market share is fierce. California has capped the
number of slot machines at 52,000. Fifty-two casinos already are
operating with more than 40,000 slots. Tribes that have begun gaming
also worry about nearby rancherias siphoning off business as new
casinos open.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tribes are tiny -- some with fewer than a dozen
members. A tribe with one adult member -- the Augustines -- opened a
casino in Coachella.</TE>
<TE>   For insiders, that means few to share the spoils. For outsiders,
"small tribes are easier to control," said Cheryl Schmitt, director
of Stand Up for California, a gambling watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   The rewards can be substantial. Tribal casinos brought in $12
billion in revenue nationally last year. They donated nearly $4
million to national parties, and their candidates so far this
election cycle and paid out $15.6 million for federal lobbying,
according to Dwight L. Morris &amp; Associates, a campaign-finance
research company.</TE>
<TE>   In California, campaign donations by tribes to state candidates
have topped $42 million since 1999, and annual tribal gambling
revenue exceeds $5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The California brand of hardball "concerns me," said Bureau of
Indian Affairs head Neal McCaleb. "It makes me wonder what's next."</TE>
<TE>   Six months after passage of Proposition 1A, Buena Vista leader
Donnamarie Potts announced that the tribe was teaming up with Cascade
Entertainment Group, a Sacramento gaming firm, to build a
$100-million casino on its rancheria 30 miles southeast of the state
capital. Most of the investors were New York financiers, a Cascade
executive said, but he would not identify them.</TE>
<TE>   They envisioned a sprawling gambling hall filled with 2,000 slot
machines, restaurants, a concert arena and a Native American
sculpture garden. A high fence and a park would protect the old
cemetery, Potts said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the graves on the knoll holds the remains of Jesse Flying
Cloud Pope, the father of Rhonda Morningstar Pope. She objected to
the prospect of a casino. The plan would desecrate the cemetery, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pope charged that she had been unlawfully excluded when Potts
formed the tribal government in 1994. Pope argued that she should be
negotiating for the tribe because she is a Buena Vista Miwok by
blood, while Potts is related to the tribe only by marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Between her salary as a bookkeeper and child care payments, Pope's
annual income is only $30,000. But she hired three law firms to steer
her claim through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the courts.
Sources say her financial backer is Thomas C. Wilmot, a Rochester,
N.Y., shopping-mall developer and Democratic donor who has invested
in several tribes around the country hoping to build casinos. Wilmot
would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pope does not rule out supporting a Buena Vista casino somewhere
outside the rancheria grounds. Under federal law, Native Americans
can purchase property adjacent to their reservations and ask that the
U.S. take the land into trust, recognizing it as territory where
tribal rule holds sway. Several undeveloped parcels border the Buena
Vista rancheria.</TE>
<TE>   Pope's breakthrough came Dec. 27, 2001, when the superintendent of
the Central California BIA office agreed to void the tribe's
constitution, essentially removing Potts from control and cutting off
federal funding that paid her tribal salary of $20,000 a year. A few
months later, a court order postponed any work on the casino until
the wrangling was resolved.</TE>
<TE>   Potts and Cascade Entertainment were stunned, their grand plan put
on hold and maybe canceled altogether. Cascade executives said they
had already sunk $10 million into the project. The assault on
Washington began soon afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy Hitters</TE>
<TE>   Potts and Cascade lured plenty of big shots to their cause. The
consulting team included Reed and Stone and at least 10 others, such
as a former University of California regent and legislator; a San
Francisco energy lobbyist and former Interior Department official;
and several partners in the law firm Gale A. Norton left to become
the Interior secretary.</TE>
<TE>   To work Capitol Hill, Potts hired two Democrats, both former BIA
appointees under former President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big fight," Potts said. "We were losing everything."</TE>
<TE>   Potts appealed the Central California BIA decision to the BIA
regional director in Sacramento. But she was worried about the
viewpoint of several officials in the BIA's regional office who
belong to a neighboring tribe, the Ione Band of Miwoks.</TE>
<TE>   The Iones too have buried kin at the Buena Vista graveyard; they
also have discussed gaming with potential investors -- giving them
two reasons to be unhappy about Potts' progress toward a casino just
a country lane away.</TE>
<TE>   Hedging their bets, Potts' lobbyists pursued another tack. The BIA
sometimes allows appeals to go straight to Washington for a judgment.
Potts' counselors set out to make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   The decision fell to Wayne Smith, the deputy director of the BIA.
Smith had asked for authority over gambling and land issues when he
moved to Washington from Sacramento in August 2001. If I'd known then
what I know now," Smith said, "I'd have taken water issues or
energy."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said he soon heard from Jennifer Farley, a White House aide
in the intergovernmental affairs office. She wanted him to talk with
a friend of hers from her days at the Dole campaign, and with his
boss Reed. She began calling weekly to inquire about the case, Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the calls, White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan
responded for Farley. "We dismiss these assertions. They don't
accurately represent the facts," she said. Asked whether that meant
the calls didn't take place, she declined to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Cascade worked other connections as well. California Senate
Republican leader Jim Brulte forwarded an e-mail to Smith from a
former aide working for Cascade. And Deputy Interior Secretary J.
Steven Griles passed along a letter from an old friend being paid by
Cascade. "Can you tell me about this?" Griles scribbled on the sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Smith asked BIA head McCaleb for advice: Should he take control of
the Potts-Pope dispute right away and make the decision himself, or
should he allow it to go through the usual appeal process at the
regional office?</TE>
<TE>   McCaleb said not to intervene. Smith "told me the process was
working," McCaleb said. When he got phone calls from Potts'
lobbyists, he referred them to Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Power Lunch</TE>
<TE>   Reed invited Smith to lunch March 14 at a seafood restaurant on
Washington's K Street, a thoroughfare locally known as Lobbyists'
Gulch.</TE>
<TE>   In Smith's recounting, he told Reed flat out that he was going to
let Potts' appeals run the regular course. Reed was not happy. The
lobbyist's response was to reach into his coat pocket, drawing out a
piece of paper folded in thirds.</TE>
<TE>   "It would look really bad if this got out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith acted surprised when he read it, Reed recalled. That's
because he was, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The paper was a letter to a tribe seeking consulting work. It was
signed by Philip Bersinger, who had once been a partner of Smith's in
a now-dissolved consulting business in California for nontribal card
rooms. The letter was written on "Bersinger &amp; Smith" stationery. It
was one of two in Reed's possession that invoked Smith's name to drum
up business with tribes in Washington state and California.</TE>
<TE>   Bersinger phrased his qualifications this way: "As for the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, no one is better connected than me." He mentioned
his vacations with Smith and that Smith stayed at his home whenever
he traveled to Sacramento. "I could go on and on, but I think you get
the picture," Bersinger wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "These letters could embarrass the secretary [of the Interior] and
the White House," Reed told his lunch companion.</TE>
<TE>   In his mind, Smith said, the conversation had turned ominous:
"First came the threat, then the blackmail."</TE>
<TE>   Reed's account of the lunch is similar but differs on two
important points. He said Smith told him the Buena Vista issue would
be decided in Washington, as Reed and the rest of the Potts team had
hoped. The warning about the letters, Reed said, was merely friendly
advice.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the discrepancy, both men stuck by their stories.
Smith said he never told any of Potts' representatives at any time
that he would fast-track the matter to D.C. Reed said Smith "tells
you what you want to hear and then does nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Smith left the restaurant with reason for concern. He was still
close to Bersinger, staying at his house during visits to Sacramento
-- and once allowed him to tag along to a restaurant meeting with
Potts and her advisors. He knew that the letter Reed had shown him
could cast an ugly light on their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Smith says he phoned Bersinger and told him that selling their
friendship was inappropriate.</TE>
<TE>   But by this time, Bersinger was already engaged with the Potts
group. Within weeks of Smith's lecture, Bersinger had two meetings
with Potts' attorney, John Peebles, and Cascade's president, Russell
Pratt. Through his attorney, Bersinger said he didn't invoke Smith in
any way this time. But Potts' group says Bersinger talked of Smith
repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil said only he could solve the problem at the BIA. It was a
heavy lift. And worth a lot of money," said Jean Munoz, a public
relations consultant who said she was authorized to speak for Peebles
and Pratt. Asked how much money, according to Munoz, Bersinger said
he had to talk with Smith and get back to them. She said Bersinger
claimed to have "a long-standing business plan" with his important
pal.</TE>
<TE>   On April 4, Bersinger visited Peebles, indicated he had talked
with Smith, then asked for $25,000 a month plus a percentage of
casino revenue, Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer asked Bersinger to put it in writing. A copy was
obtained by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Bersinger used his personal stationary and never mentioned Smith
or fees. He wrote that he would be available to consult on Potts'
interest in the BIA's recognition of her tribal leadership. His
services, he wrote, would include advice and, "when appropriate,
representation before administrative agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Bersinger's attorney, Matt Jacobs, says "I categorically deny that
he said any" of the statements that Potts' side attributed to him.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said his old friend "never talked to me. I didn't know
anything about this."</TE>
<TE>   Leaks and Fakes</TE>
<TE>   In mid-April, Michael Copperthite, an advisor to a faction of the
Iones, says Roger Stone gave him copies of the Bersinger letters,
told him that Wayne Smith was "a bad guy," and asked him to get the
documents to the press.</TE>
<TE>   Stone did not return phone calls seeking comment. But Copperthite
says he sent the letters to Time magazine, which then ran a story
about Bersinger's relationship with Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, several offices at the Interior received a faxed
message expressing concern about Smith's reported behavior. The fax
appeared to come from David Quintana, then an Indian affairs aide to
California Senate Republicans. Quintana said in an interview that he
did not send any faxes and that the cover sheet appeared to have been
fashioned from his business card.</TE>
<TE>   Tribal leaders also received faxes urging them to call the
Interior Department and demand Smith's firing. The faxes came from a
Colorado group they'd never heard of.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI and internal Interior Department investigators began an
inquiry into whether Smith tried to get the Buena Vista and other
tribes to hire his friends, or whether he was the victim of a
frame-up by people connected to the Buena Vistas or others.</TE>
<TE>   On May 2, Smith said, he was called into the office of one of
Interior Secretary Norton's top aides, Sue Ellen Wooldridge.
According to Smith, she told him not to mention the White House
interest in the Buena Vista case to anyone, including federal
investigators, or he would be "gone in a heartbeat."</TE>
<TE>   Wooldridge says she was upset after learning that Smith had
revealed internal discussions to an outsider, a mutual friend who is
lobbying for California tribes. But she said she never told him to
hide anything from federal agents.</TE>
<TE>   Smith and his attorney, Nancy Luque, said they later told federal
authorities about the conversation. No federal law enforcement
official would comment on the case.</TE>
<TE>   On May 6, the BIA's Pacific regional director upheld the original
decision in favor of Pope, ruling that Potts was not entitled to lead
the Buena Vista tribe. The official window for bringing the decision
back to Washington had opened.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, Smith was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Smith says he was never given an official reason. His dismissal
letter states only that his services were "no longer required." The
FBI and internal Interior investigators had not reached any
conclusions. Interior officials refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "My friend wrote some ... letters, he never lobbied me, and I got
fired," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't look good, I don't deny that, but I never knew what he
was up to. And there is no evidence that I did."</TE>
<TE>   As he was packing up his boxes, three men showed up in the BIA
corridor at the Interior Department for an appointment with Smith's
replacement and Secretary Norton's counsel.</TE>
<TE>   The visitors were from Norton's old law firm. They were there on
Potts' behalf to talk about Buena Vista rancheria.</TE>
<TE>   No Compromise</TE>
<TE>   In late September, on a week's notice, the two factions claiming
the Buena Vista mantle were requested to appear in Room 485 of the
Russell Senate Office Building for a hearing by the Senate Indian
Affairs Committee. McCaleb's new deputy was asked to testify as well.</TE>
<TE>   The committee has 15 members. Only Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.) showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Potts testified that she hoped to use gambling proceeds for an
elder center, education and a source of loans for her tribe of six
adults and six children.</TE>
<TE>   Pope did not appear, but her attorneys explained that she was not
against economic development -- she just didn't want the ancestral
site developed.</TE>
<TE>   Campbell advised them to work out a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Pope's group had thought of that too. Potts
said afterward that she has already been offered $2.8 million by her
rival to end the appeal and accept the decision that ousted her from
her tribal role.</TE>
<TE>   She refused. "My heritage is not for sale," she said.</TE>

<HD>Senate Foes Scrap in Minnesota Debate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Democrat Walter F. Mondale and Republican Norm Coleman sparred Monday
in a rare election-eve debate, a fitting end to the unusual five-day
Senate race between the two in Minnesota.</LD>
<LD>   Mondale sought to portray Coleman -- who was recruited by the
White House to run for the seat that had been held by Democratic Sen.
Paul Wellstone -- as a puppet of President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   Coleman said his ties to the administration would help the state.
"If I win," he said, "the president is going to owe me big time." He
pledged to be his "own man."</LD>
<TE>   Coleman accused Mondale, a U.S. senator from 1964 to 1976 who then
served as vice president in the Carter administration, of
representing the politics of the past.</TE>
<TE>   It was the only meeting of the candidates since Mondale was tapped
by state Democrats on Wednesday to run in place of Wellstone, who
died in a plane crash Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   The debate was broadcast live on CNN, underscoring the attention
the contest has gained since Wellstone's death and Mondale's
selection as his replacement.</TE>
<TE>   The race long has been seen as crucial in determining which party
controls the Senate. Coleman and Wellstone had been neck and neck in
the polls, and surveys show the Coleman-Mondale race is likely to be
close.</TE>
<TE>   No clear-cut winner appeared to emerge from Monday's one-hour
debate.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph G. Peschek, a political scientist at Hamline University in
St. Paul, said he thought Mondale, 74, did a "good job of dispelling
notions he's not up to the job because of his age. He was
well-informed about current issues and fairly aggressive about
pointing out his differences with Coleman." But he added: "Coleman
stood his ground and did not shrink."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Mondale struck the more aggressive tone, John J.
Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College,
said he thought that might have benefited Coleman, "if only because
good manners play well in Minnesota."</TE>
<TE>   The consensus among analysts was that the debate was likely to
have little effect on the election's outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of them touched all the right notes for their base, and for
the independents already leaning their way," said Larry Sabato, a
University of Virginia political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Seated at a table across from each other at Fitzgerald Theatre in
St. Paul, the candidates differed sharply on such issues as Bush's
tax cut, a possible unilateral U.S. strike against Iraq, homeland
security legislation and who would be more effective.</TE>
<TE>   "I can be independent. I owe no one," Mondale said, noting that
Coleman has received millions of dollars in campaign contributions
from special interests.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, citing Mondale's recent membership on corporate boards,
answered: "When we talk about ... corporate America, that's been your
world."</TE>
<TE>   "That's really charming, to hear a Republican worry about a
Democrat who knows something about business," Mondale shot back.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman pledged, if elected, to "change the tone in Washington" by
stressing bipartisanship.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale responded with another barb, saying: "What you're doing is
sticking with the right wing [of the GOP] and pretending to change
the tone."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale said he would have voted the same as Wellstone in opposing
the resolution passed by the Senate last month that authorizes Bush
to use force against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman said that without the bipartisan vote in support of the
resolution, the administration "would be negotiating from weakness"
in its efforts to prod the United Nations to take a tougher stance
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Mondale said the prospect of the U.S. going it alone against Iraq
"is not strength, Norman, that is weakness."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman noted that while Mondale was vice president, "we had
double-digit inflation. We had folks waiting in line to get
gasoline."</TE>
<TE>   Mondale, borrowing the line Coleman has used against him,
responded: "This election is about the future. It's not about the
collapse of the shah [of Iran] in 1979."</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With record-setting amounts of money invested in the fight to control
Congress, President Bush and candidates around the country engaged in
frenetic last-minute politicking on Monday, ending a tense but
largely themeless campaign.</LD>
<LD>   The two major political parties are on track to raise at least
$500 million in largely unregulated donations from corporations,
unions and wealthy individuals -- the "soft money" financing that
will be banned after election day. That will break the record set in
the 2000 election, when Congress and the presidency were on the
ballot.</LD>
<LD>   "The money in this year's races is making this election another
one for the record books," said Steve Weiss, an analyst with the
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.</LD>
<TE>   With so much money and power at stake, candidates Monday made
their closing pitches for support: Republicans mostly wrapped
themselves in the mantle of Bush's popularity while many Democrats --
especially those in conservative states -- sold themselves as
independents.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a race about which one of us is going to be an
independent senator in Washington," said Jeanne Shaheen, the
Democratic governor of New Hampshire, who is running for an open
Senate seat against Republican Rep. John E. Sununu.</TE>
<TE>   Bush continued to hopscotch across the country to campaign for
Republican candidates. Like other leaders in both parties, he focused
on rousing people to cast their ballots in an election whose lack of
focus on a compelling issue seems to have left many voters cold.</TE>
<TE>   "These elections -- they're kind of tight," Bush said in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa. "A tight election means you can have a tremendous
influence on who wins."</TE>
<TE>   The suspense in today's congressional elections centers on
relatively few races. Although all 435 House seats are on the ballot,
analysts rate no more than 20 as up for grabs. Of the 34 Senate seats
at stake, roughly eight are viewed as competitive.</TE>
<TE>   But with each chamber so narrowly divided -- the GOP controls the
House by six seats, the Democratic majority in the Senate is one --
the outcomes of these close races could reshape Capitol Hill's
balance of power.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts expected the Republicans to hold on to the House. The
analysts also gave Democrats a slight edge in the fight for control
of the Senate, though these predictions were less firm.</TE>
<TE>   In California, as in many states, there is little doubt about the
winners in congressional elections. Neither of the state's Democratic
senators, Barbara Boxer or Dianne Feinstein, is up for reelection.
And the results of all but one of the state's 53 House elections are
considered preordained.</TE>
<TE>   The one exception is the fight to succeed Rep. Gary A. Condit
(D-Ceres); the contest between Democratic state Assemblyman Dennis
Cardoza and Republican state Sen. Dick Monteith is competitive,
although Cardoza is favored to win.</TE>
<TE>   Precise figures on how much money will be spent on House and
Senate campaigns nationally will not be available until after
election day. But it is clear that the parties are engaging in a
last-call binge on soft money -- even though donors are expected to
find loopholes to continue channeling big money into politics after
the campaign finance reform law enacted takes effect on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   As of Oct. 16, the GOP had raised $221.7 million in soft-money
contributions and Democrats $199.6 million, according to an analysis
of Federal Election Commission data by the Center for Responsive
Politics. Based on fund-raising trends, the center expects the final
soft-money figures for this campaign to surpass the $500-million
record in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates' spending of the donations known as "hard money," which
are limited, also set a record in House races: The $391 million spent
through Oct. 16 is up from the record of $298 million in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   As of Oct.16, Senate candidates had spent $226 million -- down
from the $296 million spent in 2000, when Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton alone spent a record $92 million on her successful New York
Senate race.</TE>
<TE>   A list of this year's top spending races is like a field guide to
the year's closest contests. The most has been spent in North
Carolina, where the $23-million fight between Republican Elizabeth
Hanford Dole and Democrat Erskine Bowles has tightened. For months,
Dole enjoyed a large lead in the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Next in fund-raising -- topping $18 million -- is Minnesota, which
until late last month was a hard-fought contest between Republican
Norm Coleman and Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.). After the plane crash
that killed Wellstone, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale
stepped in as the Democratic candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Another barometer of election hot spots has been Bush's extensive
travel schedule. He traveled extensively throughout the year and
campaigned virtually nonstop in recent days, touting GOP candidates
in hopes of achieving more support in Congress for his program of
more tax cuts, more defense spending and more conservative judges.</TE>
<TE>   He twice traveled to South Dakota within the last week, where GOP
Rep. John R. Thune is hoping to unseat Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Bush ended up in his home state of Texas -- where he will cast his
ballot today -- after campaign stops Monday in Iowa, Missouri and
Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa, where GOP Rep. James A. Leach is battling for reelection
in a newly drawn district in eastern Iowa, Bush lavished praise on
the incumbent. "He's a breath of fresh air in Washington D.C.," Bush
said. "He's so honest he squeaks. An independent thinker."</TE>
<TE>   Leach, in fact, was one of only a handful of congressional
Republicans who last month voted against the resolution granting Bush
authority to use military force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   With Republicans favored to hold the House, the key question
appeared to be whether Bush's campaigning can help the GOP take
control of the Senate, where Democratic leaders have proved to be the
most stubborn obstacle to the administration's agenda.</TE>
<TE>   That took Bush to Missouri, where former GOP Rep. Jim Talent is
vying to defeat Sen. Jean Carnahan of Missouri, one of the Democrats'
most vulnerable incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   The president also campaigned for Sen. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas,
widely seen as the GOP incumbent most likely to lose.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson, a social conservative, divorced his wife and married a
staff member after winning his first term in 1996. That has hurt him
among his base of support.</TE>
<TE>   To shore him up, the National Republican Senatorial Committee on
Monday paid for a last-minute ad raising questions about whether his
Democratic opponent -- state Atty. Gen. Mark Pryor -- failed to pay
Social Security taxes on wages paid to a household employee.</TE>
<TE>   Pryor has proved to be a strong candidate in part because he has
portrayed himself as a centrist who shies away from traditional party
ties.</TE>
<TE>   This pattern has been followed by Democrats in other states where
Bush is popular. New Hampshire is an example.</TE>
<TE>   While Sununu on Friday welcomed Bush -- and appeared at a Monday
rally with Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York --
Shaheen has not invited well-known national Democrats to campaign for
her.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, she campaigned alone and at every stop emphasized her
independence and commitment to bipartisanship.</TE>
<TE>   In a low-key speech to employees at a Merrimack company that
manufactures solar energy equipment, Shaheen spoke of reaching across
party lines as governor. "I've worked with Republicans and Democrats
and independents in Concord," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked by a local reporter in Merrimack about Bush's appearances
for Sununu, Shaheen praised the president's handling of the war
against terrorism and his policy toward Iraq. Then she contrasted
what she called her record of independence against Sununu's record of
"voting with his party over 90% of the time."</TE>
<TE>   A series of polls released Sunday and Monday showed the race
between the two essentially a dead heat.</TE>
<TE>   Sununu and Shaheen, like Senate candidates in several other states
-- were bracing for a long night Tuesday -- and barraging supporters
with the message that turnout efforts could determine the race.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, there is growing concern that election day may be
reminiscent of the disputed 2000 presidential election.</TE>

<HD>Prelate's Apology Surprises Boston</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Gary Bergeron and his 73-year-old mother watched in amazement on
television here as Cardinal Bernard Law offered an extraordinary and
unexpected apology to victims of clerical sexual abuse.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to acknowledge publicly my responsibility for decisions
which I now see were clearly wrong," the nation's senior Catholic
prelate said Sunday at Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross.</LD>
<LD>   Standing alone in front of the altar, his voice choking at times,
Law said, "I ask forgiveness of those who have been abused."</LD>
<TE>   Bergeron, 40 -- who said he was molested for three years,
beginning when he was 11, by the late Father Joseph Birmingham --
echoed sentiments rippling through Boston on Monday. "It has been a
long time coming, and to be honest with you, it was very painful to
watch," he said. "For the first time, I saw the pain in his eyes, the
pain in his heart, the pain that has been expressed to him for some
time now by victims of clerical abuse."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal's surprise statement followed a meeting last week in
nearby Lowell, Mass., organized by Bergeron and nearly 100 other
alleged Birmingham victims and their families. The session was a
landmark event in the yearlong scandal, marking the first time the
cardinal has left the chancery to listen directly to a group of
clerical abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   Although for months he had held individual meetings with victims
at his residence, Law himself described last week's encounter as "an
occasion of grace" that prompted him to issue his 20-minute statement
at the cathedral. Among Catholics in the area, the seeming
transformation did not go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been some kind of conversion experience for him, and I
think it has to be respected," said Father Robert Bullock of Sharon,
Mass., a frequent critic of the cardinal's past policies toward abuse
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a complete taking of personal responsibility and
accountability -- free of anything subjunctive, anything equivocal
and with no generalities. This will set a new tone -- a tone of
rebuilding and reforming and renewing, and trying to rebuild the
trust and confidence that was lost. The cardinal needs all the help
he can get, and I think he knows that."</TE>
<TE>   Boston College theology professor Thomas H. Groome, a former
priest and author of the book "What Makes Us Catholic: Eight Gifts
for Life," said the cardinal fulfilled the requirements toward
repentance that "all Catholics learn in Sunday school, second grade."</TE>
<TE>   Law admitted he had done wrong, Groome said, and said he was
sorry. He asked forgiveness, "facing the people he hurt most," and he
expressed his intention "to amend his life" and not repeat his
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "What remains now is whether or not the victims can forgive him,"
Groome said.</TE>
<TE>   For some here whose lives were shattered by pedophile priests,
that prospect seemed unlikely. "My clients believe that this
statement is simply not enough," said attorney Mitchell Garabedian,
who represents hundreds of adults abused by priests in the
archdiocese. After years of negotiation, Garabedian and 86 victims of
former priest John Geoghan recently accepted a $10-million civil
settlement from the church here.</TE>
<TE>   "My clients believe that a sincere apology begins with Bernard
Cardinal Law stating that he was notified in September of 1984 that
seven children were sexually molested by Father Geoghan," said
Garabedian, referring to the priest who is in prison on a single
count of fondling a child. "And the cardinal should admit that he
acted negligently in handling the matter."</TE>
<TE>   Law did not mention any priest by name in his apology, nor did he
refer to the sweeping consequences of a controversy that began when
the Boston Globe published documents confirming that church officials
here long knew of sexual abuse complaints against Geoghan. The names
of more than 100 priests suspected of abusing children over a 40-year
period in the archdiocese have been turned over to prosecutors here.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan spokeswoman Donna Morrissey did not return calls for
comment on reaction to the cardinal's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gately, regional director of SNAP, the Survivors Network of
Those Abused by Priests, said he was unconvinced by Law's
declaration. "He has met with survivors privately, and he has never
come to this enlightenment until the news media heard about his
meeting in Lowell last week," Gately said.</TE>
<TE>   While labeling the cardinal's comments "a monumental step,"
Bergeron -- who learned as an adult that a younger brother had also
been abused by Birmingham -- stopped short of forgiving Law. "I
really want to forgive that man. I don't want to go to my grave with
the hatred that most of us have carried," he said. "But forgiveness
is a process. Forgiveness is going to happen one day at a time."</TE>

<HD>'Nonlethal' Weapons Vital, Panel Says</HD>
<DH>Military may need to control hostile people, so study is
needed, council reports. Deadly incident in Russia makes issue more
sensitive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A panel of the National Research Council called Monday for more study
by the military of "nonlethal" chemicals that might control crowds or
hostile people -- a particularly sensitive subject after Russian
forces took as many as 118 lives last month by using a gas to end a
hostage standoff in a Moscow theater.</LD>
<LD>   The panel's recommendation was part of a broad endorsement of the
idea that military commanders need a wide range of nonlethal weapons
on hand because they are being called on to serve in more situations
short of outright war.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, the Pentagon started a small but formal effort to study
new types of rubber bullets, underwater systems to protect ships,
energy beams to stop vehicles and other technologies that might
incapacitate people or machinery without causing death.</LD>
<TE>   The goal was to better respond to hostile civilians during
peacekeeping missions, humanitarian efforts and other such
situations.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Pentagon saw a role for nonlethal weapons in
defending ships and buildings, especially when there is little time
to determine whether an oncoming vehicle is friendly or carrying
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists often put themselves in the middle of noncombatants --
so how do you deal with that?" asked Miriam E. John, a senior
administrator at Sandia National Laboratories and chairwoman of the
committee that wrote the report.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go in and blow it to pieces. You have to have some
options to neutralize folks, so you can then sort out the bad guys
from the good guys," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Nonlethal weapons, John said, "should be a more integral part of
war-fighting capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   The Navy office that requested the report had no comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The National Research Council is part of the National Academies of
Science, a congressionally chartered organization that advises the
federal government on science and technology.</TE>
<TE>   The National Research Council panel that wrote the report
recommended that the Navy "invest in a richer portfolio" of research
in several areas, including chemical agents.</TE>
<TE>   Chemical agents are the most controversial area of nonlethal
technology, largely because their use is sharply limited by an
international treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty bars the use of any chemical agents -- even tear gas --
in warfare, but allows their use for law enforcement and riot
control.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics have accused the United States and other nations of
developing chemical weapons for war under the guise of law
enforcement. Pentagon spokesmen have said they are conducting no
research on nonlethal chemical compounds.</TE>
<TE>   The National Research Council panel said that nonlethal chemicals
have "compelling applications in engine stopping and crowd control
that cannot be achieved by other means."</TE>
<TE>   It recommended that the Navy boost its research into "calmative"
agents and foul-smelling "malodorants," including more study of their
effect on the human body and behavior. It also called for research
into ways to disperse the chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   The panel said that no work should proceed that violates the
Chemical Weapons Convention. But John also said it was difficult to
know what work was allowed or barred by the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   "We said that depending on who you talked to, you can get any
interpretation of the treaty that you wanted," John said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the Pentagon should issue a clear interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   The report comes just over a week after Russian forces used a gas,
identified as a version of the opiate fentanyl, to end a hostage
standoff with Chechen guerrillas in a Moscow theater. About 120 of
the 750 captives died, nearly all of them from the gas' effects.</TE>
<TE>   Edward Hammond of the Sunshine Project, which has been trying to
obtain and publicize documents related to U.S. chemical agent
research, said the panel's report was "a body blow to global chemical
weapons control."</TE>
<TE>   "The panel's findings will be used by the Pentagon to redouble
their chemical weapons development efforts, with potentially
disastrous results for arms control," he said. "Other countries will
follow suit, and controls on chemical weapons could quickly
destabilize."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Wheelis, a professor of microbiology at UC Davis who has
written widely on chemical and biological weapon controls, said
research on nonlethal chemicals would "erode the norms against using
chemicals as a weapon."</TE>
<TE>   He said the same manufacturing equipment and delivery systems for
nonlethal chemicals can be used for lethal agents.</TE>
<TE>   "We would make it far more difficult to figure out if other
nations have lethal chemical weapons or not," he said. "It's much
easier to hide a lethal chemical weapons program if you have a
nonlethal program."</TE>

<HD>Angry Ventura Picks Independent</HD>
<DH>He names Dean Barkley to fill Wellstone's Senate seat,
further clouding the issue of succession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura on Monday named an independent to
replace the late Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone, casting in doubt
which party will control the Senate during the forthcoming lame-duck
session of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura's abrupt election-eve appointment of Dean Barkley, a
fellow member of the Independence Party, means that the Senate could
be divided among 49 Republicans, 49 Democrats and two independents
when it meets early next week to consider important year-end
legislation, including appropriations for the current fiscal year,
creation of a Department of Homeland Security and executive-branch
and judicial nominations.</LD>
<LD>   To fill the vacancy created by Wellstone's death in a plane crash
Oct. 25, the prickly Ventura timed his announcement to begin as
Republican Norm Coleman and Democrat Walter F. Mondale were starting
a one-on-one televised debate that omitted an Independence Party
candidate.</LD>
<TE>   The governor previously had indicated that he might delay an
appointment until after the election but said he was angered at
Republicans and Democrats and the media for shutting out third-party
viewpoints.</TE>
<TE>   "My appointee is a person of the highest integrity, has a keen
sense of what is in the best interest of ordinary Minnesotans and
will put the people's interest before the party's interest," Ventura
said.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley eventually will be succeeded by the winner of today's
election for Wellstone's seat. But it was unclear Monday whether that
would occur as soon as the election results are certified, an event
scheduled on or soon after Nov. 19, or whether Barkley would serve
out Wellstone's term, which ends Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, who ran for the Senate in 1996 on a third-party ticket,
said Monday that he has not decided whether to throw his vote behind
Democrats or Republicans or remain neutral. Independent Sen. James M.
Jeffords of Vermont lines up with the Democrats, giving them a
reed-thin one-vote majority.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really care which party controls the U.S. Senate,"
Barkley said at a news conference in Minneapolis. "I could care less
whether it's Democrats or Republicans. What I care about is what I
can do for the state of Minnesota, and I will use my position the
best I can to forward that principle."</TE>
<TE>   Joking that he would caucus "by myself in a bathroom" if
necessary, Barkley said he would try to pull transportation funding
toward his state, a plum often available during year-end bargaining
over the federal budget.</TE>
<TE>   If the interim senator aligns with the Republicans, Sen. Trent
Lott of Mississippi would automatically become the majority leader
for at least a short time, attaining that position by virtue of the
tie-breaking authority of Vice President Dick Cheney.</TE>
<TE>   It would be the second time in the 107th Congress that Lott has
held the post. He was majority leader for just over four months in
early 2001, helping President Bush push through a $1.35-trillion,
10-year tax cut before Jeffords quit the Republican Party and shifted
power to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   But this time, the consequences of temporary power shifts in the
teeter-totter Senate are unclear. With so few days left in a
stalemated Congress, bipartisan deal making likely will be required
to get anything substantial done. Still, the twists could affect the
legislation and nominations awaiting consideration.</TE>
<TE>   Any power shift, though, is unlikely to change leadership or
membership on Senate committees, because the chamber will not have
time to reorganize them.</TE>
<TE>   Lott, in an interview Monday with conservative talk radio host
Oliver L. North, said he called to congratulate Barkley after Ventura
announced the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in the catbird's seat right now," Lott said, "and the
decisions he makes will be very important."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican leader said he would use the post, if Barkley tips
the Senate to him, to push for passage of homeland security, port
security and terrorism insurance legislation and to try to move
stalled executive and judicial nominees. Also pending are a raft of
appropriation bills to keep the government running.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, however, could filibuster to block Republican actions.
Neither party has the 60 votes needed to shut down a filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Another scenario could lead to an almost immediate Republican
takeover, even if Democrats win control of the Senate when the 108th
Congress starts in January.</TE>
<TE>   If Missouri voters today elect Republican Jim Talent as senator,
he would oust the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Jean Carnahan, as soon
as the results are certified and accepted by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   That possibility arises because Carnahan's husband, Mel, was
elected to the Senate two years ago even though he had been killed in
a plane crash three weeks previously, and his widow was appointed to
fill the seat.</TE>
<TE>   Today's election is for the remaining four years of Mel Carnahan's
term, which means that the seat will be filled immediately by the
winner. If Talent becomes the 50th Republican senator, the majority
would swing to his party.</TE>
<TE>   The set of circumstances that would enable Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle (D-S.D) to keep his title through the end of the year is
equally dizzying.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle would remain in his post if Barkley decides not to side
with Republicans and if Talent fails to oust Carnahan. But there is
another variable: the length of Barkley's service.</TE>
<TE>   In an opinion issued by the office of Minnesota Atty. Gen. Mike
Hatch, a Democrat, state law requires the winner of the
Coleman-Mondale contest to be seated to fill Wellstone's term after
the election results are made official. That would apparently occur
on or shortly after Nov. 19. But Senate officials have issued a
conflicting opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle, said Senate lawyers
have said that Barkley's term would end on Jan. 3, not earlier.</TE>
<TE>   If Coleman wins and the state attorney general's view prevails,
Daschle could lose power. But, of course, he could regain it within
weeks if today's vote goes well for the Democrats.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Names 4 Countries Hiding Smallpox Virus</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. intelligence has concluded that four nations outside of the
United States -- Iraq, North Korea, Russia and France -- probably
possess hidden samples of the smallpox virus, a U.S. official said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials worry that Iraq and North Korea could develop
potent biological weapons with their samples, and Russian laxity
could allow other nations to obtain the deadly disease for use as a
weapon.</LD>
<LD>   The fears that smallpox, declared eradicated in 1980, could again
be loose on the world have driven the Bush administration to consider
vaccinations for the American populace.</LD>
<TE>   Many experts suspected North Korea had samples of the smallpox
virus. A Russian intelligence report made public in 1993 accused
Pyongyang of having a smallpox weapon, though that has not been
publicly corroborated.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington Post, which first reported the intelligence finding
on its Web site late Monday, said France's samples are believed to be
for defensive research programs aimed at limiting casualties from an
outbreak.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1998, U.N. weapon inspectors found limited evidence of a
smallpox program in Iraq.</TE>

<HD>Two Shootings Could Be Tied to Sniper Case</HD>
<DH>Similarities are seen in September incidents in Maryland.
They also occurred in area where the ex-wife of suspect Muhammad
lives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Police investigating the three-week spate of killings
in the suburbs of the nation's capital are examining two shootings
that occurred in September near a house occupied by a suspect's
former wife, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A police spokeswoman in Prince George's County, Md., said sniper
task force investigators were looking into both shootings because
they had occurred near the neighborhood where Mildred Muhammad, the
ex-wife of sniper suspect John Allen Muhammad, has been living.
"We're waiting to hear from the task force" on both cases, Cpl. Diane
Richardson said.</LD>
<LD>   Both incidents occurred in Clinton, a Prince George's County
community where Mildred Muhammad and her three children moved from
Tacoma, Wash., after her marriage fell apart. Witnesses have reported
that John Allen Muhammad surfaced in Clinton in September and even
may have played with his children.</LD>
<TE>   Police departments across the country -- from the Washington,
D.C., area to Washington state -- are burrowing through unsolved
robbery and homicide cases, looking for links to the sniper slayings.</TE>
<TE>   If a Sept. 5 shooting in Clinton is connected to the sniper
suspects, it would add a crucial link to the timeline, suggesting
that the crime spree may have begun three days before Muhammad showed
up in Camden, N.J., where he bought a blue Chevrolet Caprice that
police say hid a mobile sniper's nest. A second shooting on Sept. 15
-- a day after a liquor store employee was wounded by rifle fire in
neighboring Montgomery County and six days before a suspected related
slaying in Montgomery, Ala. -- would signal another burst of
activity.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the run of shootings that killed 10 and wounded three
in and around the Washington region last month, Prince George's
detectives suspected that the shootings on Sept. 5 and Sept. 15 had
been committed by one assailant.</TE>
<TE>   In each case, a victim was wounded by a gunman armed with a
.22-caliber pistol who then fled into the night.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigators already thought the cases were related because
the suspect's M.O. [modus operandi] was the same in each case,"
Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sept. 15 incident, the gunman escaped with a man's wallet.
In the Sept. 5 case, the suspect grabbed more than $3,000 in cash and
a laptop computer.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said police were waiting to hear from task force
officials whether the stolen laptop matched a computer found in the
blue Caprice in which Muhammad and fellow suspect Lee Boyd Malvo were
arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County Police Capt. Nancy Demme, a task force
spokeswoman, said Monday that an FBI analysis of the computer would
not be completed until today at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   But the laptop's owner said he became suspicious as soon as he
heard that police had found a Sony Vaio laptop computer in the
Caprice.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly makes me wonder," said Paul LaRuffa, a restaurant
owner who was shot six times and lost his computer and his night
receipts on Sept. 5. "The guy who shot me didn't give me any warning.
All of a sudden, my car window shatters and I'm hit."</TE>
<TE>   LaRuffa said he had checked his America Online account to see if
his computer had been used for Internet traffic since it was stolen
and found no activity.</TE>
<TE>   Wounded in his arm, stomach, diaphragm and back, LaRuffa
recuperated speedily in two weeks and is back at work, hobbled only
by nerve damage in one hand. He did not see his assailant, but other
restaurant employees described the shooter as an adult black male --
a sighting that mirrored witness accounts in the Sept. 15 incident.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, Richardson said, an unidentified businessman was
shot in the stomach within minutes after closing for the night. "A
suspect ran up and began firing," Richardson said. The attacker fled
with the man's wallet. None of the witnesses saw a second assailant,
Richardson said.</TE>
<TE>   Muhammad, 41, was arrested at a Maryland rest stop Oct. 24 along
with Malvo, a 17-year-old Jamaican who reportedly accompanied him
during a yearlong trek across the country. While Muhammad has been
charged with murder in Maryland, Virginia, Alabama and Louisiana, he
is being held by federal authorities on a firearm warrant.</TE>
<TE>   Malvo, who also has been charged with murder in the same states,
appeared before a federal judge in Greenbelt, Md., on Monday for a
detention hearing. Because he is under 18, the details of his
two-hour hearing were sealed. Muhammad is scheduled to appear today
for his own detention hearing before a federal magistrate in
Greenbelt.</TE>

<HD>Court to Hear Case on Telemarketers</HD>
<DH>U.S. justices will decide whether the 1st Amendment
protects solicitors. States want to prosecute them because very
little money ends up with charities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court agreed Monday to consider giving state prosecutors
more power to crack down on telemarketers who solicit for charities
but keep most of the money for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from Illinois and 18 other states want to prosecute some
telemarketers for consumer fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Charitable solicitations generate more than $200 billion per year,
yet a relatively small percentage of this money supports a charity.</LD>
<TE>   In the case before the court, a group called Telemarketing
Associates solicited on behalf of VietNow, which provides food and
shelter for Vietnam War veterans.</TE>
<TE>   But Illinois prosecutors said only 3% of the money solicited by
Telemarketing Associates supports Vietnam veterans.</TE>
<TE>   State prosecutors, however, have run into a surprising obstacle:
the 1st Amendment and its freedom of speech protections.</TE>
<TE>   In past rulings, the high court has said that states cannot force
solicitors to speak a certain message or disclose certain facts, such
as what percentage of the money will go to charity. These rulings
have knocked down a series of state laws and local ordinances that
required fund-raisers to tell the public where the money will go.</TE>
<TE>   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist dissented from these
decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, and he has made it clear that he
would be glad to reverse them.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Illinois Supreme Court threw out a consumer fraud
charge against Telemarketing Associates and did so based on the high
court's past free speech decisions involving fund-raising. Those
rulings "compel us to reach the decision we announce today," the
Illinois court said.</TE>
<TE>   Illinois Atty. Gen. James Ryan appealed. The 1st Amendment has
been "transformed into a license for unscrupulous fund-raisers to
defraud the public in the name of raising money for charity," Ryan
said.</TE>
<TE>   The high court should "rectify this constitutional error" and give
prosecutors more leeway to prosecute solicitors whose fund-raising
amounts to a fraud.</TE>
<TE>   The justices said Monday that they will take up the case of Ryan
vs. Telemarketing Associates. Arguments will be heard early next
year.</TE>

<LD>Bob Sansevere in the St. Paul Pioneer Press: "Warning: If you are
easily depressed you might not want to continue reading.</LD>
<LD>   "OK, you've been warned. The minimum wage in the United States is
$5.15 an hour. It takes Kevin Garnett less than seven seconds to make
that much....</LD>
<LD>   "When you're making $25.2 million a year, which is what the
Timberwolves are paying Garnett, the money doesn't flow. It gushes.
He makes $69,041.10 a day, $2,876.71 an hour, $47.95 a minute....</LD>
<TE>   "Said Wolves' Coach Flip Saunders, 'A lot of people make that
money.' Not in the NBA they don't. Garnett has been the highest-paid
player for the last four seasons. [He] will continue to be the No.
1-paid player this season. Next season too."</TE>
<TE>   And, how was your day before reading this?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which school holds the Pacific 10 record for
consecutive victories?</TE>
<TE>   Don't hold back: New Orleans Hornet point guard Baron Davis, on
playing for Coach George Karl in last summer's World Championship,
where the United States finished sixth:</TE>
<TE>   "I hated it. I can't speak for anyone else, but I didn't like
playing for him. I'm glad it's over with, and if he ever had to coach
another one of those teams, I would decline. I don't like George
Karl."</TE>
<TE>   Very poor judgment: Jason Cole in the Miami Herald: "Detroit Lion
President Matt Millen opened a can of worms with a comment that one
of his team's defensive starters is a 'devout coward.' Millen didn't
name the player when he made the comments on a radio show, casting
everyone in a bad light."</TE>
<TE>   Subdued approach: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Warrior rookie Coach Eric Mussselman asks the arena crew to tone
down the pregame introductions, screaming announcer, music and disco
light show.</TE>
<TE>   "Makes sense. When you order a Big Mac, you don't get it delivered
on a flaming skewer by four waiters in tuxedos. Where has this guy
been all our lives?"</TE>
<TE>   Barely warmed up: Bud Geracie in the San Jose Mercury News: "Yao
Ming's 11-minute stint in his NBA debut was the shortest by a No. 1
overall pick since Kent Benson played two minutes for Don Nelson's
Milwaukee Bucks in 1977."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: Gene Rock, an All-American USC basketball player of the early
1940s who died Thursday, was a detective for the Los Angeles Police
Department for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1921, UCLA, in its third season of
football, lost to Whittier, 62-0. That was an improvement over the
previous season, when Whittier routed the Bruins, 103-0.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: USC, 25, 1931 to 1933, when the streak ended in a
0-0 tie with Oregon State. The Beavers played that entire game
without a substitution.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bret Lewis on radio station KFWB: "Manchester United,
one of the most popular soccer teams in the world, has learned that
at least 18,000 of their season-ticket holders are dead.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems the families didn't want the club to know, for fear they
would lose their seats at Old Trafford. The club says it will give
the fans a chance to come clean and keep their tickets."</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Punch" by John Feinstein</LD>
<LD>   Price: $25.95</LD>
<TE>   One would hope that it was not fate that brought Kermit
Washington's fist together with Rudy Tomjanovich's face on Dec. 9,
1977, because not even fate should be that cruel.</TE>
<TE>   The infamous, horrifying and nearly fatal moment that is
chronicled in John Feinstein's book took less than 10 seconds, but
its effects linger to this day.</TE>
<TE>   After Washington's punch, the NBA got tough on fighting. League
officials saw what one big, strong man could do to another with his
fists, and that's one reason why skirmishes such as the recent one
between Rick Fox and Doug Christie are dealt with so quickly and
harshly.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, author of "Season on the Brink" and "A Good Walk
Spoiled" is best known for his in-depth work while following his
subject for a long period of time. In "The Punch," he goes back a
quarter of a century and shows what that one moment meant.</TE>
<TE>   Few people know that Tomjanovich could have died that night at the
Forum because of massive facial injuries. Or that the punch led to
the NBA adding a third referee. Or that Jerry West said one reason he
got out of coaching was because of the bloody event. Or that the same
man was responsible for both players being drafted. That was Pete
Newell, and it was his off-season work with Washington in the early
1970s that led to his famous Big Man Camp.</TE>
<TE>   Both players retired at virtually the same time in 1982. They
hated being defined by the punch. Tomjanovich, who has battled
alcoholism, overcame his insecurity to become a two-time NBA champion
as coach of the Houston Rockets. Washington, who has had many
personal and professional setbacks since 1977, would like to become a
coach, but he feels he is being blacklisted by the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   It is a remarkable piece of work about two good men linked by one
awful moment.</TE>

<HD>Toledo Is Coach Trojans May Have to Admire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'll tell you what a great job UCLA's Bob Toledo is doing this
season: He's not only on track for Pacific 10 coach-of-the-year
consideration, he's also going to have USC fans cheering loudly for
the Bruins.</LD>
<LD>   I'm happy for the Trojan faithful, of course, because I've been to
some of the games in the Coliseum, and you know how uptight USC
Athletic Director Mike Garrett is when it comes to making noise, so
this will be a good release, cheering loudly for UCLA in the Rose
Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   NOW SOME things are going to have to fall into place before Trojan
fans can get the thrill of feeling what it's like to be a Bruin fan
for a day.</TE>
<TE>   But I think a case can be made that come nightfall on Dec. 7, the
USC faithful will be singing the praises of Toledo, which is really
going to confuse the UCLA boosters who have asked for his dismissal.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what has to happen first: Washington State has to lose to
either No. 15-ranked Oregon or rival Washington before coming to the
Rose Bowl to play the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   And the Trojans have to keep winning, meaning that USC also will
beat UCLA, and I can't imagine that being a problem with the Trojans
having a Heisman Trophy candidate playing quarterback and the Bruins
going with a youngster who would probably be thrilled just to meet
Mr. Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   So if all goes well, that would pit Washington State against UCLA
on Dec. 7 -- a day that could very well live in cross-town infamy
with the Bruins in position to determine whether the Trojans go to
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW IF UCLA beats the Cougars, and for some reason doesn't follow
the script and also defeats the Trojans, imagine the scene in the
Rose Bowl as his players hoist Toledo atop their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe that's not a good idea since the Bruins will be
playing in a bowl game and we wouldn't want anyone crushed, but right
now without question Toledo deserves credit rather than the barbs I
continue to hear.</TE>
<TE>   The media placed UCLA sixth in preseason Pac-10 polls after the
Bruins lost 23 seniors, including at least seven players who have
spent time in the NFL this season.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Bruins lost quarterback Cory Paus for the year, and we
got the very best out of Toledo -- winning with freshman Matt Moore
at quarterback, and then a week later with freshman Drew Olson.
Toledo must be some kind of teacher, or baby sitter.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins are 6-3, and if they don't slip against a Pac-10
doormat in Arizona, they'll be in position to shock most observers
with a 9-3 finish and a significant bowl opportunity, or at worst, go
7-5 and meet preseason expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Now as much criticism as Toledo took a year ago for the Bruins'
collapse, he deserves just as much credit for finding ways to win
with 10 freshmen set to letter -- the most in UCLA history.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned a great lesson last year," Toledo said Monday. "I had
to be the leader with so many things hitting me all at once, and I
felt like a boxer taking body punches, and while I wasn't going down,
I staggered a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm different his year. I'm much more positive with the
players. I almost went down with the players last year after losing
to Stanford. It rocked me too, with all the expectations of winning
every game and the national championship. This year with nothing to
lose, we're just having fun, and I can't tell you how much I enjoy
this group of kids."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is having fun at UCLA. There have been e-mails,
letters and cries for Toledo's ouster because the Bruins have not won
every game -- the curse of the BCS and nothing else really matters --
and yet Toledo's exciting brand of football has attracted an average
crowd of 61,000 to the Rose Bowl with even bigger crowds expected for
games against USC and Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA starts three seniors on offense, four on defense, and so
Toledo must be some kind of recruiter to use the kids to fill in the
gaps, and keep winning.</TE>
<TE>   There also hasn't been any talk of problems off the field for some
time, and if the newspaper is going to make a big deal out of
documenting everything that goes wrong, the same notice should be
given when all is well.</TE>
<TE>   If Toledo weren't doing the coaching job of the year, then USC
might not have a chance to play in the Rose Bowl. In fact if I'm a
Trojan fan, and we're talking strictly hypothetically here, I'm
hoping Toledo remains UCLA's coach forever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I HAVE bad news for subscribers to The Times -- after appearing on
ESPN's "Around the Horn" for the first time, it's obvious I'll have
to hang onto my day job.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS a fashion show Monday, and according to the press
release it included Serena and Venus Williams, Jennifer Capriati,
Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport, And More!</TE>
<TE>   "And More!" to me means Anna Kournikova, but when I called to
verify, I swear the woman who answered the telephone actually slapped
me across the face.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I STOPPED by Staples Center to say goodbye to the Kings as they
begin an eight-city trip that will take them back and forth across
the country "on the longest road trip in NHL history," said Coach
Andy Murray.</TE>
<TE>   I know how grueling that can be, so I told him to take his time
and there was no reason to hurry back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Fred Wallace:</TE>
<TE>   "Are you still waiting to interview Julie Krone? If you had to
wait, were you allowed to wait in the locker room? Isn't that where
reporters usually wait to interview athletes? Please don't tell me
you were not permitted in the women's locker room."</TE>

<HD>It's Triple Damages in Kobe's Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A quick report on the state of Kobe Bryant's game: The Kobe stopper
couldn't stop praising Kobe.</LD>
<LD>   When Portland swingman Ruben Patterson was laughing at Bryant
during Sunday night's Laker-Trail Blazer game, it wasn't to mock him.
It was because Bryant kept rising up on him and making jumpers that
were just ridiculous.</LD>
<LD>   "He hit some tough shots," Patterson said. "That's why I was
sitting there, laughing."</LD>
<TE>   And what about Bryant's willingness to share the ball?</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed that too," Patterson said. "He was looking for his
teammates more. I'm gonna tell you, when he first got in the league,
he was looking to score. But [now] he has confidence in his teammates
to make shots."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant explained, "The offense is going to come. If the team gives
me a good shot, I'm going to take it."</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere on the path toward becoming the next Michael Jordan,
Bryant got sidetracked and began heading in the direction of Magic
Johnson. In his last two games, he has shown a Magical flair for
doing whatever it takes to win, besides posting consecutive
triple-doubles with an average of 33 points, 14.5 rebounds and 12
assists.</TE>
<TE>   He's showing the ability to single-handedly carry a team, as
opposed to letting Shaquille O'Neal do the heavy lifting and then
coming by to ask, "You need a hand with that?"</TE>
<TE>   And he's doing it in more ways than simply shooting. As recently
as last season, his method of making up for O'Neal's absence was to
go for a career-high 56 points against the Memphis Grizzlies. Now
he's helping Devean George score a career-high 25 points.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Bryant had three NBA championships before his 24th
birthday he did have one gap on his resume: Since Bryant became a
starter in 1999, the Lakers were 12-15 without O'Neal. That was a
reflection on Bryant, something factored into his ranking among the
great perimeter players. When on his own, he didn't wilt the way
Penny Hardaway did after Shaq left Orlando, but he also didn't
blossom as Tracy McGrady has since leaving Vince Carter behind in
Canada and having Grant Hill fall by the wayside in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   This is Bryant's chance to back up his label as the game's best
all-around player, and he's taking advantage. He adapted quickly
after nine-for-29 shooting the first night out. Of course Bryant had
to shoot that night. Who else was going to make up for O'Neal's 28
points, Soumaila Samake?</TE>
<TE>   But that led to assistant coach Tex Winter and Bryant trading
barbs, as reported in an ESPN.com story. That's just their
personalities. Winter is cantankerous, Bryant is bullheaded, and the
issue appeared to have gone away over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   On a plane flight recently, I was stuck watching "K-19," a movie
featuring Harrison Ford -- with a horribly inconsistent Russian
accent -- as the commanding officer of a Cold War-era Soviet
submarine. As soon as the boat hit the water, he put it through every
conceivable catastrophe -- from a fire in the galley to a forced dive
to depths that almost crushed the hull -- to test the limits of the
sub and its crew.</TE>
<TE>   It reminded me of the beginning of the Lakers' season: one crisis
after another, like a drill to see how this team would respond to
adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Captain! Shaquille O'Neal on the injured list.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox suspended six games for fighting, sir!</TE>
<TE>   Media reports that Kobe Bryant and Tex Winter are saying bad
things about each other!</TE>
<TE>   Whew. Time to surface. Down periscope. Take a look around the NBA
landscape and the Lakers are showing signs that they'll be OK.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal came close to hitting the alarm after the first game. But
that was only because he was leaning back against a Staples Center
wall that had a fire alarm lacking the necessary height clearance for
a 7-foot-1 center.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked him if he was concerned about the Lakers' poor
showing in an 87-82 loss to San Antonio on ring night, O'Neal said,
"Nahhh. We're going to get back on track."</TE>
<TE>   The Big Train's scheduled departure is Nov. 12, O'Neal's projected
return date from toe surgery.</TE>
<TE>   It did get worse before it got better, with the Lakers sinking to
a blowout loss at Portland before bouncing back with victories over
the Clippers and Trail Blazers at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   The different matchups helped. The Spurs shadowed Bryant with
their big men, so when he got by their guards and made his way into
the lane, he suddenly was looking up at a whole lot of Tim Duncan. On
Sunday night, Portland Coach Maurice Cheeks went with small lineups,
so even when the help arrived, it was easy for Bryant to look over
the players and see the basket or his teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Phil Jackson leaned more heavily on veterans Brian Shaw,
Robert Horry and Derek Fisher than he would have preferred Sunday
night, but he and the Lakers felt challenged. So they responded and
passed the test.</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, there could be more injuries or suspensions during the
playoffs. And the other teams are treating this as the real deal, not
just a drill.</TE>
<TE>   "Playing the Lakers is a barometer, no matter if they have this
guy, they don't have that guy," Cheeks said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers still think long-range -- "We're just trying to find a
rhythm and try to execute better," Shaw said -- so they aren't ready
to panic or celebrate in November. What they've shown at the moment,
in their reduced state, is just a little of that championship touch.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody's eyes get wide open when Shaq is not playing,"
Patterson said. "But they've still got Kobe and other guys, [like]
Robert Horry, that can play. They're just a great team. Without Shaq
or with Shaq."</TE>
<TE>   You know what that sounds like? A compliment to Kobe.</TE>

<HD>BCS Standings Shuffled</HD>
<DH>Oklahoma retains top spot, but Ohio State moves past Miami
into second place.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Miami won a school-record 30th consecutive game Saturday but suffered
a rare loss Monday, the Hurricanes dropping to No. 3 in the third
bowl championship series standings.</LD>
<LD>   In the ongoing decimal-points battle for college football
supremacy, Oklahoma retained top position with 2.04 points, and Ohio
State jumped three spots from last week to claim the coveted No. 2
spot with 5.57 points.</LD>
<LD>   Miami, the defending national champion, is .44 behind Ohio State
with a 6.01 total, but the situation may only be temporary.</LD>
<TE>   In other words, don't call out the riot squad in Coral Gables just
yet.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the BCS top-10 includes Texas at No. 4, followed by
Washington State, Georgia, Notre Dame, Iowa, USC and Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   The schools with the two lowest point totals in the final
standings Dec. 8 will play for the BCS national title in the Fiesta
Bowl on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Miami's BCS slide was almost inevitable, given that the Hurricanes
struggled Saturday to beat lowly Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   The only surprise was that Ohio State, not Notre Dame, took
advantage of events.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame trailed Miami by only .33 last week and looked a cinch
to pass the Hurricanes with a win over Boston College.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish lost, though, which allowed Ohio State to move in on
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   With his team having had to rally to win its last three games,
Miami Coach Larry Coker says he has more to worry about than
rankings.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be easy to rate us if we don't play better," he said
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Miami can probably determine its own fate in the coming
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes, if they beat Tennessee in Knoxville this week,
will probably inch past Ohio State in next week's BCS standings. And
two of Miami's final four opponents are ranked in this week's top 25,
Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   So if Miami wins out, it would seem to have BCS
strength-of-schedule advantage over Ohio State, which plays unranked
Purdue and Illinois before its showdown Nov. 23 against Michigan in
Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   To put this week's standings in perspective, Miami lost half a
point in the BCS just for falling to No. 2 in this week's Associated
Press poll. Yet, a win over Tennessee this week could push Miami back
to No. 1 and that alone might make up the deficit to Ohio State.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, some of this BCS stuff is unexplainable.</TE>
<TE>   Miami, for instance, improved its computer ranking from 4.33 last
week to 2.67 this week despite playing Rutgers, yet lost ground in
the strength-of-schedule component, dropping from 1.36 to 1.84.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State, fifth last week in the BCS and 2.8 points out of
second place, made huge gains, in large part because two of the teams
ranked ahead of the Buckeyes, Notre Dame and Georgia, lost over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio State picked up two points in the poll-average component, and
also improved its point total in the computer and
strength-of-schedule components.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame remains in the national title picture, although the
school's drop from No. 9 and No. 10 in the coaches' and writers'
polls makes it more difficult. The Irish are seventh in the BCS, 9.76
points behind No. 2 Ohio State.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>MRI for Maggette</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers received mixed MRI exam news Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Quentin Richardson sat out practice because of a hyper-extended
right knee and an MRI exam later in the day indicated no damage.
Richardson, injured in the second quarter of the Clippers' victory
Sunday against the Detroit Pistons, was termed day-to-day by a team
official.</LD>
<LD>   Corey Maggette practiced Monday, but experienced swelling and
underwent an MRI exam that revealed torn cartilage in his right knee.
Maggette said he plans to play Wednesday against the Philadelphia
76ers.</LD>
<TE>   Maggette's injury is the same one Elton Brand suffered during Team
USA's training camp in preparation for the World Championship in
August. Brand underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept.
26 and missed all eight of the Clippers' exhibitions. He has started
each of the Clippers' three regular-season games.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Maggette had arthroscopic surgery to remove damaged
cartilage in his left knee and was sidelined for 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers already are without small forward Lamar Odom until
Christmas because of a badly sprained right ankle. Maggette has
filled in for Odom, who last played Jan. 18. Odom also has been
suffering from a sore right wrist.</TE>
<TE>   "We're beyond worrying about it now," Coach Alvin Gentry said,
referring to the series of injuries that has threatened to derail
what many believed would be the most successful season for the
Clippers since they moved to Los Angeles from San Diego before the
1984-85 season.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson, Brand and center Michael Olowokandi (tendinitis in
left knee and a strained left hip) sat out almost all of training
camp. Brand and Olowokandi played their best games of the season
Sunday against Detroit. Brand had 17 points and 13 rebounds and
Olowokandi had 19 points and tied his career best with 20 rebounds in
the Clippers' 74-72 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson sprained the same knee Oct. 4 and was sidelined for all
but one of eight exhibition games. He started the first two
regular-season games, but was replaced by Eric Piatkowski against the
Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   If Richardson isn't fit to play at Philadelphia, the first game of
a four-game trip, Gentry probably will use three other guards to fill
the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Piatkowski is expected to start against the 76ers, but Gentry said
he also would play point guards Keyon Dooling and Marko Jaric. Gentry
played Dooling and Jaric with point guard Andre Miller for much of
the second half Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   If Maggette isn't sound, Gentry also could use the
Dooling-Jaric-Miller alignment.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST LANSING, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Michigan State football Coach Bobby Williams was fired Monday, two
days after the Spartans dropped to 3-6 with their worst loss in 55
years.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, one of four black coaches among the 117 schools in
Division I-A football, was informed of his firing by Athletic
Director Ron Mason after Monday's practice.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers agreed to terms Monday on a two-year minor league
contract with right-hander Luke Prokopec, the Australian pitcher
traded from Los Angeles to Toronto for reliever Paul Quantrill and
shortstop Cesar Izturis last winter.</LD>
<LD>   Prokopec went 2-9 with a 6.78 earned-run average for the Blue Jays
before suffering a shoulder injury that required major surgery on
Sept. 14. The Blue Jays tried to send Prokopec outright to triple A,
but he declined the assignment and became a free agent.</LD>
<LD>   Prokopec, 24, pitched for the Dodgers in 2000 and 2001, going 9-8
with a 4.63 ERA in 34 games. He spent six years in the Dodger farm
system, compiling a 30-21 record with a 3.59 ERA. Prokopec is not
expected to resume throwing until July or August, but he will spend
next season rehabilitating with the Dodgers in hopes of pitching in
2004.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have hired Rene Francisco as international scouting
director and Al LaMacchia as a major league scout, and promoted scout
Mark Weidemaier to special assistant to the general manager.</TE>
<TE>   Francisco joins the Dodgers after 10 years with the Atlanta
Braves, most recently as Latin America coordinator. LaMacchia was
most recently with Tampa Bay.</TE>

<HD>Family Crisis Calls Gerber</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goalie Martin Gerber returned to Switzerland Monday to be with his
mother, who is suffering from cancer.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, the most important thing in your life is your family,"
Coach Mike Babcock said. "I said to Martin the other day that I lost
my mom to cancer when I was 29. Martin is 28. It's a nightmare. I
said to him the only gift of cancer is it allows you to say goodbye."</LD>
<LD>   Duck officials were unaware of the situation until Gerber
approached assistant coach Lorne Henning late last week. Team
officials quickly made arrangements to get Gerber back to
Switzerland.</LD>
<TE>   "What can we say but our thoughts and prayers are with him,"
Babcock said. "It puts things in perspective."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks recalled goalie J.F. Damphousse from Cincinnati to serve
as Jean-Sebastien Giguere's backup while Gerber is away.</TE>
<TE>   Damphousse is not expected to play.</TE>
<TE>   "He better not get in," Babcock said. "Nothing against Damphousse,
but we need Jigger to carry the mail. He has to be our best player.
That's the reality of the situation and he knows that."</TE>
<TE>   Giguere has been sharper the last three games, although he gave up
four goals against San Jose on Sunday. He has a 2.97 goals-against
average and a .889 save percentage.</TE>
<TE>   Damphousse, a first-round pick in 1997, was acquired from New
Jersey during the summer in the trade that brought right wing Petr
Sykora to Anaheim. Damphousse had a 2-2 record with a 3.24
goals-against average and a .899 save percentage in four games with
Cincinnati this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Alexei Smirnov suffered a bruised right wrist in
Monday's practice, according to Duck officials. Smirnov was injured
when he banged his hand against the boards during a drill, but X-rays
were negative.</TE>
<TE>   Smirnov, a 20-year old rookie, has played well for the Ducks. He
has one goal and two points, but at 6 feet 4, 218 pounds, his
physical presence on the ice has helped the team.</TE>

<LD>Anne Yelsey, the No. 1 player on the Corona del Mar High girls'
tennis team, has committed to Stanford.</LD>
<LD>   Yelsey was a singles quarterfinalist in the 2001 Southern Section
individual tournament but missed most of the early season because of
a knee injury and is currently playing doubles. She is ranked No. 3
in the U.S. Tennis Assn. Southern California girls' 18 division.</LD>
<LD>   "This is like, the hardest decision I've ever made. I didn't sleep
for a couple of nights, thinking about it," said Yelsey, who visited
Palo Alto last weekend and chose Stanford over Harvard and UCLA. "But
the tennis is just unmatched. They're the best."</LD>

<TE>   There will be a national award winner selected from 12 finalists,

<TE>   Chino Hills Ayala is favored to win its 11th consecutive girls'
title in the Sierra League cross-country finals at Mount San Antonio
College today, but the season hasn't gone as well as Coach Erik
Stakey would have liked.</TE>
<TE>   With its top seven runners back from last year's team that placed
third and fifth in the Southern Section and state Division I finals,
Ayala figured to be among the top squads in the state this year. But
that hasn't happened.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had setbacks," Starkey said when asked if injuries had
contributed to their struggles. "But we also haven't performed as
well as we've wanted to."</TE>
<TE>   The difference between this year and last year was evident in the
Mount San Antonio College Invitational on Oct. 26 when Ayala placed
10th in the sweepstakes race after finishing second last year.
Luckily for Ayala, the Bulldogs can still turn their season around.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we told the girls," Stakey said. "That we could use
the [league finals] as a springboard to the rest of the season."</TE>

<LD>   There are no changes in the top 10 as many of the ranked teams did
not race last week in preparation for this week's league finals. Simi
Valley Royal won its second consecutive Ventura County title Friday,
but the Highlanders weren't impressive enough in that race to
overtake any of the teams in front of them.</LD>

former No. 7 Ventura drops out after an injury to one of its top five
runners contributed to a third-place finish behind Simi Valley Royal
and Oak Park in the Ventura County championships Friday. Villa Park

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A smorgasbord of notes, quotes and opinions from across Southern
California:</LD>
<LD>   Josh Shipp was the sixth man on Fairfax's City Section runner-up
boys' basketball team last season as a sophomore, averaging close to
10 points a game.</LD>
<LD>   This season, Coach Harvey Kitani said he wouldn't be surprised if
the 6-foot-4 Shipp doubled his offensive numbers.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, he's the best junior around," Kitani said.</TE>
<TE>   It seems as if everyone in the Shipp family is a three-point
shooter. Brother Joe plays for California and is one of the best in
the Pacific 10 Conference. Josh and his youngest brother, Jerren, a
freshman at Fairfax, also can shoot threes.</TE>
<TE>   But the most accurate shooter in the family is probably their
grandfather, James Knight, who played at Kentucky State and taught
each boy how to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "He's 74 and still thinks he can outshoot anyone," Shipp's mother,
Debra, said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the men's gym at UCLA being renovated, Santa Monica St.
Monica High became the new hot spot to play pick-up games over the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Making appearances were NBA players Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady,
Earl Watson and Mike Dunleavy, plus college players Jason Kapono and
Ray Young.</TE>
<TE>   If only St. Monica Coach Chris Quinn could suit up one of his
visitors for a game or two this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   High school baseball teams are starting to flex their muscles in
winter ball, and one team that's ready to take on the best is Quartz
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels, who will compete in Division II, have top hitters up
and down their lineup. Catcher Alex Massari and first baseman Daniel
Slayton have already committed to Fresno State. Shortstop Matt Ware
is considered one of the top juniors in the country. Another junior,
second baseman Brian Chavez, was an alternate for the Junior Olympic
team. Outfielder Kent Wulf, a transfer from Palmdale Highland, led
the Golden League with eight home runs.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Lance Pierson is also excited about 14-year-old right-hander
Chase Tigert, a 6-2 freshman who was throwing 85 mph as an
eighth-grader. Pierson coached Matt Harrington at Palmdale High and
knows something about top pitching prospects.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore middle linebacker Luke Laolagi of Lake Balboa Birmingham
has star quality written all over him, and it's not just because he
likes wearing one of his five pairs of sunglasses around campus.</TE>
<TE>   Laolagi, who's 6-1, 185 pounds, is fast, tough and athletic. He's
one of the leading tacklers for Birmingham (6-2, 3-0 in West Valley
League). He's also a starting infielder for the baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a player," Coach Ed Croson said.</TE>
<TE>   Laolagi receives lots of attention for his sunglasses. They rarely
come off. He wears them because his eyes are sensitive to the sun,
but classmates think they fit his personality.</TE>
<TE>   "They think I'm a cool guy," Laolagi said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark (8-0), ranked No. 22 by The Times, is in contention for
its first Marmonte League football championship. No one should be
surprised, considering the Musketeers have one of the best coaches in
Southern California in Tim Lins.</TE>
<TE>   Lins was only 27 when he became coach at Encino Crespi in 1989. He
took the Celts to the 1993 Division I semifinals, where they lost to
top-seeded Rialto Eisenhower, 7-3.</TE>
<TE>   This is his fourth season at Moorpark. He's a defensive
specialist, and that's the strength of the Musketeers, who led by
linebacker Wes Pryor and defensive back Dennis Pitta, have allowed
only 57 points this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia's football team is 8-0 and one of the favorites to win
the Southern Section Division X championship.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Garrison has several players who could be competing at
the college level one day.</TE>
<TE>   Tailback-linebacker Adam Gabriel is a 6-2, 235-pound senior who
has recruiting trips set for Colorado and Wisconsin. Junior tight end
Jamie Sbicca is 6-5, 230 pounds and figures to be heavily recruited
next season. Sophomore receiver Jesse Canada has terrific potential.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Simi Valley will hold an alumni boys'
basketball game Nov. 27. It's an alumni filled with former
All-Southern Section players, including former NBA player Don
MacLean. The Pioneers' 1988 Southern Section championship team will
be honored, along with former coaches Bob Hawking and Dean
Bradshaw.... Corona's football team has a future college player in
6-1, 283-pound junior offensive lineman Clarence Tuioti'Mariner. He
bench presses 335 pounds and would beat anyone in a doughnut-eating
contest.... Danny Bae, who won the City Section golf championship
last season at Fairfax, has transferred to Burbank.</TE>

<HD>Defenseman Miller Close to Returning</HD>

<LD>Defenseman Aaron Miller took another step toward returning to the
lineup Monday when he skated with the Kings during warmups before
their game against the Minnesota Wild at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who has not played this season because of abdominal
surgery, will also participate in warmups before tonight's game at
San Jose and could be back in the lineup as soon as Friday when the
Kings play at Ottawa.</LD>
<LD>   "We did that with [Ian Laperriere] before he returned," Coach Andy
Murray said. "I think it helps the player adjust to being in a game
environment.... There's getting back physically and then there's
getting back mentally."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray said one of the most consistent players for the Kings this
season has been defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, who struggled at times
last season after a solid rookie season in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "He's using his legs better and that's the big thing," Murray
said, "whether it's a give-and-go or getting in for a puck on a
breakout before a guy gets a stick on him. Last year, he was getting
caught all the time getting to the puck. If he gets pinned in the
corner because of his size, he can't be effective."</TE>
<TE>   Murray believes that part of the reason for Visnovsky's drop-off
last season was the difficulty his wife Nina, then his fiancee, had
obtaining an immigration visa.</TE>

<HD>Kings Can't Shut Down the Wild's West Show</HD>
<DH>Minnesota shows why it has the best record in the
conference, and league, with convincing 5-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NHL season may only be a month old but the Kings played a key
home game Monday night against one of the Western Conference's elite
teams.</LD>
<LD>   The Detroit Red Wings? No. The Colorado Avalanche? Try again.</LD>
<LD>   The power the Kings faced was the surprising Minnesota Wild, which
came in with the best record in the conference and did not
disappoint.</LD>
<TE>   Behind three goals from budding star Marian Gaborik, the Wild
handed the Kings a 5-2 defeat in front of 16,653 at Staples Center to
improve its record to 9-2-2, which now stands alone as the best in
the league.</TE>
<TE>   "It was disappointing for our team but we have to give the No. 1
team in the NHL credit," King Coach Andy Murray said. "They're
playing hard and competing. They're doing what they have to do to
win."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' problem on Monday was a lackluster power-play unit,
which scored once in six chances.</TE>
<TE>   "Our puck-protection skills in the offensive zone was not good,"
Murray said. "We were losing too many loose-puck battles. And it
looks like we're having opportunities to shoot the puck, but we're
not shooting it. Minnesota does an excellent job of blocking out at
the front of the net and we were not able to get the puck through."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who have been up and down this season when playing with
a man advantage, didn't just have trouble scoring in that situation;
they also gave up a short-handed goal by Gaborik in the second
period.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, for your power play to work, you give a
responsibility to your top-end offensive players and that's a
responsibility that they've asked for and they need to execute,"
Murray said about a King power play that began Monday's game ranked
only 20th in the NHL, and 25th at home.</TE>
<TE>   With Jamie Storr playing instead of No. 1 goaltender Felix Potvin,
the Kings seemed a little sluggish right from the opening faceoff.
After giving up five goals in an overtime victory over Nashville on
Saturday, the Kings' defense picked up right where it left off by
giving up a goal 2:40 into the game.</TE>
<TE>   Gaborik, who established a team record last season with 30 goals,
put the Wild ahead, 1-0, when he collected a loose puck that bounced
between King center Ian Laperriere's skates and beat Storr with shot
from near the right circle for his fourth power-play goal of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Storr, who had not played since losing at Columbus eight days ago,
appeared to have lost sight of the puck after former King Cliff
Ronning's shot missed wide and bounced off the backboards.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a scramble in front of the net and went to the side," said
Storr, who finished with 18 saves. "This all happened in a split
second and before you know it, the puck is in the empty net."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings came back to tie the score, 1-1, before the opening
period ended when rookie Alexander Frolov scored his fourth goal of
the season at 15:25.</TE>
<TE>   Frolov, who has three goals in his last two games, was set up by a
perfect backhand pass from Eric Belanger and easily beat Minnesota
goaltender Dwayne Roloson from the edge of the crease.</TE>
<TE>   But Minnesota, which has been in the league only since the 2000-01
season, jumped back on top in the second period on Gaborik's second
goal of the game and ninth of the season.</TE>
<TE>   With the Kings on a power play, Gaborik found himself with plenty
of open ice after picking up the puck in the neutral zone and then
squeezed in a goal between Storr's pads from the left circle to give
the Wild a 2-1 lead at 6:53.</TE>
<TE>   "That goal bothered me the most," said Storr, who was playing in
his third game this season. "When a goal like that goes in, it's a
deflater for yourself and for the team."</TE>
<TE>   The Wild added an insurance goal late in the third period when
Ronning blasted home a shot over diving King captain Mattias Norstrom
and beat Storr high to his glove side at 17:07.</TE>
<TE>   With Storr pulled to give the Kings a six-on-four power play, Los
Angeles cut Minnesota's lead to 3-2 with 1:39 remaining on Jaroslav
Modry's fourth goal.</TE>
<TE>   But that was the end of the Kings' comeback as the Wild responded
with two empty-net goals in the final minute.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Kings hit the road for 17 days, starting an eight-game
trip at San Jose tonight.</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Attention Is on Bryant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the eve of the Lakers' first extended trip of the season, the
attention was more on Kobe Bryant's numbers than Shaquille O'Neal's
toe.</LD>
<LD>   When the Lakers play at Cleveland tonight, Bryant has a chance to
do something no other Laker has done since Magic Johnson in 1987.
He'll be going for his third consecutive triple-double.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, who had consecutive triple-doubles in 1991, had four in
succession from March 31 through April 5 of 1987. No one since has
had even three.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had a light practice Monday morning before flying to
Cleveland. After tonight's game against the Cavaliers, they will be
at Boston for a Thursday night TNT game, then will play Michael
Jordan and the Wizards at Washington on Friday. That game will be
televised by Channel 9 and ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who has targeted the Lakers' next home game Nov. 12
against Atlanta as the his return date from toe surgery, practiced
again Monday and looked good.</TE>
<TE>   "He put in more time on the court, but it was less intense," Coach
Phil Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   That was because it was less intense for everyone. Jackson went
easy on his players after Sunday night's overtime game against
Portland.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Bryant and Robert Horry didn't scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant was given a rest after finishing with 33 points, 14
rebounds and 12 assists in 50 minutes in the 98-95 victory over the
Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   Horry, who played 47 minutes, is nursing a bruised heel, but
Jackson said he's OK.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant posted his two triple-doubles after an ESPN.com column by
Charley Rosen quoted assistant coach Tex Winter as saying Bryant was
"selfish" and "uncoachable."</TE>
<TE>   Winter, in an interview with KLAC's Larry Burnett, said he thought
he was talking off the record while giving Rosen a ride to his hotel
after the Lakers' season opener, a loss to San Antonio in which
Bryant missed 20 of 29 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned something," Winter said. "After 56 years in basketball,
I'm still learning things. Charley was a friend -- he's still a
friend -- and I was talking to him as a friend. I should have
realized that he's a reporter now."</TE>
<TE>   Winter said he and Bryant had no problem, and Jackson downplayed
the whole thing.</TE>
<TE>   "These things go on all the time with us," he said. "Sometimes we
use them as a sparkplug."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Besides Bryant, Devean George also had an outstanding game Sunday
night. He had a career-high 25 points on nine-of-18 shooting, was
five for seven from the free-throw line and had eight rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   George's scoring average of 13.8 is second on the team behind
Bryant's 29.5.</TE>
<TE>   George has been starting in place of Rick Fox, serving a six-game
suspension for fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's suspension ends after Thursday's game at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Might Jackson consider keeping George a starter?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't do that," he said. "Rick was forced out. Now if he
comes back and doesn't play well, then we might consider a change."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Cleveland</TE>
<TE>   4 (5:30, Ch. 9)</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570)</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 2-2, Cavaliers 1-2</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Cavaliers (2001-2002) -- 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- This is the Cavaliers' fourth game and all have been
home openers. They opened the season at Sacramento, then played the
Clippers in their home opener, then in Phoenix's home opener. This
game is the Cavaliers' home opener. They were routed by the Kings,
94-67, then edged the Clippers, 98-86, before losing at Phoenix the
next night, 78-74. Guard Ricky Davis was the Cavaliers' leading
scorer in all three games and is averaging 21 points a game. The
Cavaliers' starting center, 7-foot-3 Lithuanian Zydrunas Ilgauskas,
should be a good test for Laker 7-footer Soumaila Samake.</TE>

<HD>Jefferson Keeps Nets on a Roll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The way the New Jersey Nets are playing, Jason Kidd's prediction of
60 victories this season might be too low.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Jefferson matched his career high with 22 points and the
undefeated Nets forced the Minnesota Timberwolves into a team-record
29 turnovers in a 106-82 victory Monday night at East Rutherford,
N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "They're good," said Kevin Garnett, who led Minnesota with 23
points and 10 rebounds. "I'm not going to sit here and [knock] them.
I'm not going to take that away from them. They were the better team
tonight."</LD>
<TE>   In winning their fourth in a row and moving within a victory of
their best start, the Nets were far better than Minnesota on both
ends of the court.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did New Jersey win, Kidd only had to play 30 minutes,
scoring 10 points and handing out 12 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson, who was eight for 13 from the field, and the Net
defense went a long way in allowing Kidd to rest the entire fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew what I was capable of doing," said Jefferson, who became a
starter after Keith Van Horn was traded in the off-season. "My
teammates and coaches knew what I was capable of doing. That's why
they put me in that position. I'm not doing anything amazing."</TE>
<TE>   That's debatable. Jefferson made a several highlight-reel plays,
the best being a windmill dunk over 7-foot center Rasho Nesterovic
after a second-quarter baseline drive.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't give him too much credit, but when I go home and relax
I'll go 'Phew!' " veteran Net guard Lucious Harris said. "You keep
giving him credit, you don't know how big his head will be."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 109, Chicago 105 -- Lindsey Hunter made a jumper with 1.2
seconds remaining in overtime to lift the Raptors at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter and Voshon Lenard each scored 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Raptors played without All-Stars Vince Carter (strained left
quadriceps tendon) and Antonio Davis (strained left ribcage).</TE>
<TE>   Alvin Williams had a team-high 25 points for the Raptors, who have
won 15 in a row against Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 97, New York 88 -- Sam Cassell scored seven consecutive
points for the Bucks after New York rallied from a 16-point deficit
in front of the first non-sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden in
nearly a decade.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 18,100 -- more than 1,600 short of capacity -- watched
the Knicks drop to 0-4. New York's sellout streak ended at 433 games.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell scored 22 points -- half of them in the last 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 103, Memphis 101 -- Tim Duncan made a 12-footer for
San Antonio as time expired in overtime at Memphis, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Officials reviewed the final play and said Duncan made the shot
with eighth-tenths of a second remaining, capping a comeback for the
Spurs, who outscored the Grizzlies, 7-0, in the final 1:03.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, who finished with 29 points and 14 rebounds, scored nine
points in the overtime.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio has won 20 in a row against the Grizzlies.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 107, Golden State 100 -- Steve Nash scored 30 points and
Dirk Nowitzki had 24 points at Dallas, helping the Mavericks extend
their winning streak against the Warriors to 14 games.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Richardson scored 39 points for the Warriors, one short of
his career high.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel scored five consecutive points down the stretch with
the game in the balance, and Michael Finley had 17 points to help the
Mavericks (3-0) to their best start since they won their first three
games in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 84, Phoenix 82 -- Richard Hamilton scored 22 points and
the Pistons held off the Suns at Phoenix after nearly blowing a
20-point lead in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Suns closed with a 25-7 run and had a chance to tie the score
at the finish, but Stephon Marbury's driving 11-footer bounced off
the rim with 1.4 seconds to play. Marbury had 15 points and 10
assists.</TE>

<LD>Dallas Maverick center Raef LaFrentz will be sidelined three to six

Monday.</LD>
<LD>   LaFrentz suffered a third-degree sprain Saturday night in a

<TE>   Though listed as day-to-day, Toronto Raptor star Vince Carter will
miss one to two weeks after re-injuring his left quadriceps tendon
Saturday, General Manager Glen Grunwald said.</TE>

<TE>   Orlando Magic forward Grant Hill expects to miss games this season
because of his ailing left ankle, but he intends to play against the
visiting Sacramento Kings tonight despite missing the second half of
Saturday's victory at Milwaukee after feeling pain in the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A potential ownership group that includes Larry Bird is assuming
the NBA will award it the rights to a new Charlotte, N.C., franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Despite reports in the New York Daily News, Steve Belkin, a
Boston-area businessman, said the league has not approved his
application.</TE>
<TE>   "We've heard rumors that we are the front-runners, but it's not
true that we have already been selected," Belkin said.</TE>

<LD>Vancouver's special teams set the tempo early, and the Colorado
Avalanche never caught up.</LD>
<LD>   Markus Naslund and Todd Bertuzzi each had a goal and two assists,
and the Canucks beat Colorado, 4-2, Monday night at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   "It was pretty much a special teams night, and our special teams
were the difference," Vancouver Coach Marc Crawford said.</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver was two for six on the power play. Continuing to
struggle on the power play, Colorado was one for seven and remains
among the league's worst at eight for 72 (11%).</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver remained unbeaten on the road (4-0-2) and Colorado
stayed winless at home (0-2-3). The Avalanche is the only team in the
Western Conference without a victory at home.</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks' Dan Cloutier had 24 saves. Colorado's David
Aebischer, subbing for Patrick Roy, who is out because of a hip
injury, stopped 17.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 4, New York Islanders 2 -- Last season is looking like
ancient history for the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   One season removed from a fast start that propelled them into the
playoffs for the first time since 1994, the Islanders fell short at
Uniondale, N.Y., losing for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Drury scored the game-winning goal 96 seconds into the third
period, putting the Flames back on top after the Islanders rallied
from a two-goal deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The Flames picked up points for the sixth game in a row, going
2-0-2-2 during the stretch. The Islanders hadn't lost more than three
in a row since Peter Laviolette became coach last season.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like last [season] was a dream -- like it didn't
happen," Mark Parrish said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he was disappointed, Parrish said, "I was disappointed 10
games ago. Furious, maybe?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis signed goalie Tom Barrasso, an 18-year NHL veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Barrasso, 37, had been working out with the club to get into game
shape since signing a tentative deal Oct. 24. The Blues have used
four goalies this season.</TE>
<TE>   To make room for Barrasso, the Blues put defenseman Christian
Laflamme on waivers.</TE>

<KH>Helene Elliott ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>So Far, It Has Been a Really Wild Ride</HD>

<LD>The NHL standings aren't upside down. The Minnesota Wild, in its
third season of existence, leads the league with 20 points.</LD>
<LD>   "The fact that we're at the top of the league is confusing,"
General Manager Doug Risebrough said Monday, adding a laugh. "People
look at us and say, 'They're a new team and should be at the bottom
of the standings.'</LD>
<LD>   "This team has always worked hard and been resilient, but they're
seemingly able to take some games that a year or two ago would have
been losses and turn them into wins. Some of those games were so
close that even if we'd lost, I'd have felt good because we played
well. We might fall short in some of those games as we go forward,
but we're still on the right track and playing the right way."</LD>
<TE>   The "right way" is a disciplined, comprehensive game. Much of the
Wild's early six-game unbeaten streak, which ended Saturday with a
loss to Vancouver, was based on the exceptional goaltending of Manny
Fernandez and a solid defense. But Coach Jacques Lemaire also
encourages offensive creativity, capitalizing on the team's
outstanding speed and the skill of winger Marian Gaborik, who scored
three goals Monday in a 5-2 victory over the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a talented kid and he's in a good group," Risebrough said of
Gaborik, the third overall draft pick in 2000. "We've got the right
mix of veterans who can take the pressure off. We don't have to rely
on him all the time. There are others who can score."</TE>
<TE>   Nor has the Wild suffered because of the NHL's crackdown on
obstruction, as was anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "This team can skate and they work hard within the rules,"
Risebrough said. "Jacques hates bad penalties, so we've always been
low in the penalty department. The new rules help us. We didn't
change our style. We kept playing the same way."</TE>
<TE>   Getting to the top, of course, can be easier than staying there.
And how the Wild fares on its first long trip of the season, which
began Monday against the Kings at Staples Center and continues to
Phoenix and San Jose before ending Sunday in Anaheim, will test its
character.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first two years, I was kind of disappointed in the way
that we handled games or handled teams," Fernandez said last week.
"We went to Detroit, big teams like that, [and] we kind of broke down
before the game even started. I don't see that this year. We play a
different way. We play with confidence. I'm happy to see that."</TE>
<TE>   Off the ice, the Wild has been a success from the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Smart enough to build community ties through its support of high
school hockey and the Twin Cities Marathon, Minnesota has sold out
all 98 regular-season and exhibition home games. In a clever move,
the team sells rush tickets, which allow buyers to sit in any seats
that aren't occupied 10 minutes into the game. Wild jerseys are the
NHL's top seller, according to Bill Robertson, the club's vice
president of communications and broadcasting, and its merchandise
sales rank second to the Detroit Red Wings'.</TE>
<TE>   "People are just embracing us," Robertson said. "Our philosophy is
building for long-term success."</TE>
<TE>   Playing in the talent-rich West, the Wild faces a tough challenge
in trying to make the playoffs this season. Stranger things have
happened, though, and Risebrough believes the team is built to
weather slumps and prosperity.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of what happens, we'll work hard," he said, "and if we
don't get the few breaks that we got early, that's OK, because we're
playing the right way. We've made a lot of strides toward
establishing ourselves. That's opened the eyes of some people and,
more importantly, confirmed in the eyes of our players that we're on
the right track for success."</TE>
<TE>   Justice, NHL Style</TE>
<TE>   Colin Campbell, the NHL's punishment czar, acknowledged that after
looking at a side view of Thrasher defenseman Andy Sutton's
knee-on-knee hit on King center Jason Allison last Tuesday, "It looks
like he stuck his knee out."</TE>
<TE>   But when the Kings contended that Sutton had led with his knee,
Campbell re-examined the play from another angle and decided it
didn't warrant a fine or suspension. However, he asked Atlanta
General Manager Don Waddell to tell Sutton the NHL might not be so
lenient the next time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was, pardon the pun, a knee-jerk reaction to being
beaten," Campbell said. "The guy, in that situation, is moving up in
the neutral zone and is about to be beaten by a pretty good player
[Allison]. I did see it from behind and I did not think he stuck his
knee out.... Kneeing is the act of a player leading with his knee and
sometimes extending the knee. We felt there was no intent [to
injure]."</TE>
<TE>   Intent or not, Allison, who was the Kings' leading scorer, is
expected to miss seven to 11 more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not advocating that players check other players with the
safety cog in their back pocket of having their knee out," Campbell
said. "We had a number of people in the hockey operations department
look at it. Andy VanHellemond [the director of officiating] felt it
was a tripping penalty and that's it, not a kneeing penalty....
[Sutton] leaned and tried to hit with his shoulder, but Allison made
a quick move to try to avoid the shoulder check and their right knees
collided. It's unfortunate for Jason and I feel bad for him."</TE>
<TE>   Not as bad, though, as Allison feels.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers Game</TE>
<TE>   The new focus on obstruction and quick line changes made distinct
impacts on the NHL in the first 150 games of the season, through Oct.
31.</TE>
<TE>   According to NHL statisticians, scoring was up slightly, to an
average of 5.6 goals a game, compared to 5.4 goals for the same
number of games a year ago. However, the number of shutouts plunged
from 21 to 10.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly more than half of the 2,133 penalties called were for
obstruction, up from 39.8% of 1,983 penalties last season. But the
average number of penalties a game was 14.2, one more than in the
same period last season, and teams averaged a combined 32.2 penalty
minutes, up slightly from 30.9 last season. The number of power plays
per game is at 11.6, up from 10 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Games are averaging 2 hours 19 minutes, 16 minutes shorter than
last season. Which means everyone goes home at a reasonable hour, a
welcome change.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Detroit captain Steve Yzerman's recovery from knee surgery is
going well enough to anticipate his return before January, which was
when he originally was expected to play again. He skated last week,
several weeks ahead of schedule, and reportedly planned to skate
again to begin rebuilding his strength.</TE>
<TE>   Playing alongside Mario Lemieux has transformed many a journeyman
into a scorer. But there might be more than that behind the success
of Alexandre Daigle, who was the No. 1 overall draft pick in 1993 but
was out of the NHL for two seasons and playing in a Los Angeles beer
league a year ago. Daigle, signed as a free agent by Pittsburgh last
summer, wasn't ready for the pressure that accompanied the five-year,
$12.5-million deal he signed as a rookie with Ottawa. He's now
playing for less money -- $750,000 plus bonuses -- but enjoying it
more.</TE>
<TE>   A word of praise is due Flyer Coach Ken Hitchcock. Derided in
Dallas as a drudge for promoting defense and stifling creativity,
he's building around his players' strengths in Philadelphia instead
of forcing them into his mold. Of course, an injury-free John LeClair
-- seven goals, 11 points in 11 games -- makes it all work.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Islanders have given the starting goaltender's job to
Garth Snow, leaving Chris Osgood to work out his early-season
struggles. Islander Coach Peter Laviolette, hailed last season for
the team's improvement, is trying to instill more on-ice discipline
and keep players out of the penalty box.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations to Roger Neilson, Bernie Federko, Rod Langway and
Clark Gillies, who were inducted into the hockey hall of fame Monday.
Maybe hall executives have a sense of humor, because Neilson was
depicted on his plaque wearing one of his trademark ugly ties.</TE>

<HD>Long Odds for Olympic Bid</HD>
<DH>New York must overcome key political and financial
obstacles as it tries to persuade IOC to award it the 2012 Summer
Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having won the nomination as the U.S. candidate to play host to the
2012 Summer Olympics, New York must confront key local obstacles,
both political and financial, even as it undertakes to sell to an
international audience -- one not always inclined to embrace the
United States -- on the most in-your-face American city of all.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Olympic Committee's selection Saturday of New York over
San Francisco as this nation's 2012 candidate gives impetus to plans
that Olympic promoters have called a "catalyst" for rebuilding New
York in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The
bid calls for $5 billion of construction in all, on sports facilities
as well as a key subway extension, an athletes' village and an
Olympic stadium.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, New York officials must now focus on appealing
to the International Olympic Committee, which will pick the site in
2005, and competing against a field that will include Moscow and
perhaps Paris and Toronto as well as candidates from Germany, Spain
and elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   Comedian Billy Crystal, for instance, was a winner in his
joke-laced appearance before the USOC, wisecracking that New York
already has so many "foreigners" it's like being in "a giant
7-Eleven." Bid officials say they know that won't play with the IOC.</TE>
<TE>   The odds of New York ultimately prevailing, Olympic insiders said,
remain considerable. Recent history works against New York; the Games
have already been held in the United States four times since 1980,
most recently in Salt Lake City in February. In addition, there
lingers within the IOC a strain of anti-U.S. resentment, and the USOC
is so deficient at lobbying internationally that just a few weeks ago
Rio de Janeiro, not San Antonio, was chosen to host the 2007
Pan-American Games.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, next year the IOC picks the site of the 2010
Winter Games. Vancouver is a leading candidate. If it wins, that
could scramble U.S. chances for 2012, because the IOC likes to rotate
the Games around different continents.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, world events -- such as a U.S. war with Iraq -- may
alter the Olympic dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   All that said, New York offers a compelling story of courage and
valor in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks -- values that bid
officials like to stress are Olympic values.</TE>
<TE>   And the international field may well prove not as formidable as
first glance might suggest.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow and Paris, for instance, have staged the Games before; the
Games have never been in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC thought so little of Paris' 2008 bid that, in the first
round of voting last year, Paris trailed even Istanbul, ultimately
coming in third, behind Beijing and Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   With the USOC nod, New York has already shown it can beat long
odds. The Olympics in Manhattan seemed inconceivable to anyone who
witnessed the Goodwill Games in New York in 1998, dogged by
transportation and other woes. Yet New York emerged as the U.S. 2012
choice.</TE>
<TE>   "You had to do something new," said Dan Doctoroff, the New York
2012 bid chief and the city's deputy mayor for economic development.
"And if you were going to do it, you had to do it in a way that would
transform New York and leave an enormous legacy for world sport."</TE>
<TE>   The 2012 plan calls for Olympic-only ferries and commuter trains
to carry athletes to the venues; in theory, the stars of the Romanian
gymnastics team will not be scrambling to catch the westbound No. 7
subway line to connect at the Times Square station to the 1, 2, 3 or
9 trains to get to Madison Square Garden on time.</TE>
<TE>   Bid plans call for $904 million in construction for various sports
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The bid also, however, details some $4 billion in other
expenditures, including an extension of the 7 line to the West Side,
a 4,400-apartment Olympic village across the East River from the
United Nations and an 86,000-seat stadium on the far West Side.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium would be the home of the New York Jets after the
Games; the Jets now play in New Jersey, sharing the Meadowlands with
the Giants. The stadium would cost at least $700 million and be
financed largely by the Jets and the NFL; an added cost is $500
million, perhaps more, for a retractable roof and a platform to build
the stadium over existing rail yards.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium and village -- and an extension of the 7 subway line
to the far West Side -- are to be built by the city, state or private
developers and will, Doctoroff said, be built whether or not New York
gets the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Much depends on a complicated process called tax increment
financing, which may require state legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is for construction of the subway -- engineering and
design studies are already funded with $60 million -- to be underway
by 2005, in time for the IOC's vote for 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, various projects for the far West Side have been
blunted. Most recently, for instance, there was a plan to build the
Yankees a stadium. It wasn't built. In the 1980s, there was a plan
for a highway and development project. It wasn't built.</TE>
<TE>   What's different now, city officials argue, is that everything is
different -- because of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this unbelievable spirit in the city that's unlike
anything we've ever seen before," Doctoroff said.</TE>
<TE>   New York is, however, grappling with a municipal budget crisis.
Community activists have already registered complaints about the
stadium. Questions have been raised about the environmental impact of
the stadium and the traffic it might generate.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, recent weeks have seen in the local and state
political leadership, as well as on Wall Street and from private
developers, demonstrations of a real zeal to think big -- a
recognition that the attacks have afforded the city a
once-in-a-generation opportunity to contemplate projects on a grand
scale.</TE>
<TE>   "Bottom line," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York
Building Congress, a trade group that backs the Olympic bid, "I think
there is a good possibility we can pull this off. The obstacles, the
issues, are certainly not insurmountable."</TE>
<TE>   Before the terrorist attacks, he said, "I don't know if I would
have said that."</TE>
<TE>   Added Wellington Chen, a land-use consultant who serves on the New
York 2012 board of directors: "It's not that we're playing the 9/11
card. But this," the Olympic bid, "is an inspiration for us. And
people need hope."</TE>

<HD>Packer Victory Is a Bit Chilling</HD>
<DH>They make Carter look like a rookie in his return to NFL in
24-10 win over Dolphins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>GREEN BAY, Wis. -- That HBO gig doesn't sound so bad after all.</LD>
<LD>   Miami Dolphin receiver Cris Carter, who recently gave up a job on
"Inside the NFL" to rekindle his playing career, had to be pondering
that decision Monday during a 24-10 loss to Green Bay.</LD>
<LD>   The Packers (7-1) feasted on four turnovers -- two attributable to
Carter -- as they rolled to their sixth consecutive victory and held
the Dolphins (5-3) to a lone touchdown in garbage time.</LD>
<TE>   Coming into the game, the big question concerned how well Packer
quarterback Brett Favre, injured two weeks ago, could play on his
wobbly left knee. But Favre seldom winced while making his
league-leading 165th consecutive start. He's 32-0 lifetime when the
temperature at kickoff is 34 degrees or colder, as it was on this
31-degree night.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen so much from this guy, as far as playing with
injuries," Packer safety Darren Sharper said of Favre.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good role model for the rest of the guys, to see the
premier guy go out there and lay it on the line when he's had a
serious injury. It really shows the toughness of us, and the
toughness of him."</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, the unstable quarterback was Miami's Ray Lucas, who had
two passes intercepted -- one of which was returned 89 yards for a
touchdown -- and briefly left the game because of a jammed shoulder.
Lucas, who started in place of the injured Jay Fiedler, was looking
to atone for a four-interception performance two weeks ago in a loss
to Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   But their was no consolation to be found Monday. Not with the way
Green Bay's defense was batting down passes, prying loose fumbles and
stone-walling the run. After giving up 100 points in their first
three games, the Packers have given up 64 in their last five, and
only one touchdown in two games.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the defense played an outstanding game," Packer Coach
Mike Sherman said. "They applied pressure on the quarterback, and I
thought we did a great job of stifling their running attack."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas was Miami's leading rusher with 49 yards in nine carries,
two more yards than Ricky Williams, who has rushed for more than 100
yards four times this season. But the Dolphins were forced to pass
after Green Bay went up, 14-0, in the second quarter, then 17-0 and,
finally, 24-0 after Sharper's long interception return for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins didn't get on the board until Olindo Mare made a
46-yard field goal with 8:20 remaining and the packed house at
Lambeau Field barely noticed, too caught up serenading Favre with
"MVP! MVP!"</TE>
<TE>   Favre said he felt some stiffness in his knee but doesn't think it
will linger.</TE>
<TE>   "I found out after some plays I couldn't move like I thought I
could," he said. "For the most part, I thought I played normal. It
didn't affect me mentally."</TE>
<TE>   Favre completed 16 of 25 passes for 187 yards and one touchdown, a
screen to Ahman Green for a 23-yard score. That came in the second
quarter, as did Green's one-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the debut of Carter, who was conspicuous from the
start. He got himself revved up in the huddle by bashing helmets with
Williams, then, on the third play of Miami's first possession,
frantically waved his hand over his head to indicate he was open.
Lucas opted to run.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's first catch wound up going awry. He wrapped his hands
around a short pass, took a step back and was drilled by cornerback
Tyrone Williams, who knocked the ball loose. Williams recovered the
fumble, and later batted a ball away from Carter that was intercepted
by linebacker Nate Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised [Carter] let the one go, because usually once he
gets it in his hands he doesn't let it go," Sharper said, referring
to the fumble. "I don't necessarily want to say there was any rust,
but you think about a guy coming back, he's not going to be the Cris
Carter he was at the end of last year."</TE>
<TE>   Dolphin Coach Dave Wannstedt called Carter's fumble
"unacceptable," but praised the receiver for running crisp routes.
Carter felt he blocked well, and said he was no more upset about the
turnovers than he was about any during the first stage of his career
with Philadelphia and Minnesota. He said he has yet to acclimate to
the speed of live action.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain things you can't simulate," he said. "The game
is moving a lot faster."</TE>
<TE>   As for the interception, Carter said he thought he could split two
defenders but that got him in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "That's part of not playing," he said. "I couldn't see him. I
couldn't feel him."</TE>

<HD>Hinske, Jennings Win Rookie of Year Awards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A winter trade from Oakland to Toronto opened the door for Eric
Hinske, and the Blue Jay third baseman bulled his way through with a
.279 average, 24 home runs and 84 runs batted in, a distinguished
debut season that earned American League rookie of the year honors
Monday for the 25-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado pitcher Jason Jennings, the 24-year-old right-hander who
went 16-8 with a 4.52 earned-run average, was named National League
rookie of the year, becoming the first Colorado player to win the
honor.</LD>
<LD>   Hinske received 19 of 28 first-place votes and nine second-place
votes to finish with 122 points in voting by a panel of the Baseball
Writers Assn. of America. Baltimore right-hander Rodrigo Lopez (15-9,
3.57 ERA) was second with 97 points, getting nine first-place votes,
and Oriole reliever Jorge Julio (5-6, 1.99 ERA, 25 saves) was third
with 14 points.</LD>
<TE>   Jennings received 27 first-place votes and five second-place votes
for 150 points. Montreal outfielder Brad Wilkerson (.266, 20 homers,
59 RBIs) was second with 57 points, including two first-place votes,
and Cincinnati outfielder Austin Kearns (.315, 13 homers, 56 RBIs)
was third with 40 points, also getting two first-place votes.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii, who went 14-10 with a 4.27 ERA
before his season was cut short by a fractured skull Sept. 8,
received the other first-place vote and finished fourth with 14
points.</TE>
<TE>   Hinske, a 17th-round pick of the Chicago Cubs in 1998, spent 2001
in Sacramento, the A's triple-A affiliate. But in one of his first
moves as Toronto's new general manager last December, J.P. Ricciardi,
formerly the A's director of player personnel, acquired Hinske and
pitcher Justin Miller for closer Billy Koch.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stuck behind a pretty good player in Eric Chavez in
Oakland," Hinske said Monday. "J.P., in bringing me over, said, 'It's
your job to lose.' I can't thank him enough for giving me a chance to
play every day. Oakland got a great closer in Koch. Both teams made
out in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Hinske, a member of the major league all-star team that will tour
Japan this month, hit .293 with 14 homers and 44 RBIs in the first
three months, establishing himself as the favorite for the award. He
hit .308 with runners in scoring position.</TE>
<TE>   The Menasha, Wis., native had the most homers by an AL rookie
since Boston's Nomar Garciaparra hit 30 in 1997. After making 16
errors during the first half of the season, Hinske had only four
errors in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal was to just stay in the big leagues all year," said
Hinske, who will get a $50,000 bonus for winning the award. "After
the first month or two, I started getting confident in my ability to
play at the big-league level. Then you get kind of greedy. You want
to do better and better on a daily basis.... Hopefully I can take
that into next year. And hopefully I'll avoid the sophomore jinx."</TE>
<TE>   Jennings, who did not have a rookie-of-the-year bonus in his
contract, jumped from double-A to the big leagues in 2001 and had a
memorable major league debut, throwing a five-hit shutout with eight
strikeouts in a win over the New York Mets in Shea Stadium on Aug.
23.</TE>
<TE>   He opened 2002 as Colorado's fifth starter but was far more
effective and consistent than highly paid teammates Mike Hampton and
Denny Neagle. Though he had a 5.65 ERA and gave up 18 home runs in
hitter-friendly Coors field, Jennings still went 9-4 at home. He went
7-4 with a 3.35 ERA on the road, giving up eight homers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to keep it simple in Coors Field, limit your walks and
have an open mind," Jennings said. "Everyone knows it's an offensive
park. I would expect the worst and hope for the best. If you give up
five runs and you win, you have to be as happy with that as a
shutout. You can't worry about your ERA, your opposing batting
average. The name of the game is winning, keeping your team in the
game."</TE>

<HD>Rich Boats Getting Richer</HD>
<DH>As challenger series of America's Cup turns to
quarterfinals, Oracle BMW and Prada are making right moves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rich Roberts</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If one of the delights working-class fans have found in the America's
Cup over the years has been watching the egomaniacal wealthy melt
down, Larry Ellison and Patrizio Bertelli have been major
disappointments.</LD>
<LD>   Fire Oracle BMW's mellow and talented helmsman Peter Holmberg,
then replace him with the overbearing Chris Dickson, who had been
exiled eight months earlier with the crew in near mutiny?</LD>
<LD>   It worked for Ellison. His Golden Gate Yacht Club entry from San
Francisco hasn't lost since.</LD>
<TE>   Fire Prada's designer, Doug Peterson, whose creations had won the
Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and reached the final match again for
Prada in 2000? After only one race?</TE>
<TE>   It worked for Bertelli. Prada, 4-4 in the first round-robin of the
Louis Vuitton Cup challenger trials, soared to 7-1 in the second
after rebuilding the front end of its boat -- under Bertelli's
direction -- in only five days.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Bertelli knows something about boats as well as upscale
fashion accessories. Maybe Ellison understands people as well as
software. Or maybe Dickson recognized the real problem when he
suggested that Ellison get off the boat and bring Holmberg back on
board. What it means is that Oracle BMW and Prada are in the top
bracket of the quarterfinals starting next week, along with
Switzerland's quietly efficient Alinghi and Seattle's OneWorld.</TE>
<TE>   That's important in the challengers' new scheme. The racing is
turning to best-of-seven series matchups. The top four enjoy the
security of a double-elimination format, but the bottom four --
Sweden's Victory, Britain's GBR, Team Dennis Conner and France's Le
Defi Areva -- are on the chopping block.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at it another way, the two winners in the top four advance
directly to the semifinals. The two losers meet the two winners from
the bottom four, and a bottom-four boat has defeated a top-four boat
only three times in 32 races. The two losers in the bottom four go
home.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Mascalzone Latino has already left after winning only one
of 16 races. The quarterfinal lineup, with records: Upper bracket --
Alinghi (13-3) vs. Prada (11-5); Oracle BMW (12-4) vs. One World
(12-3, after one victory was deducted as a penalty).</TE>
<TE>   Lower bracket -- Victory (7-9) vs. Le Defi Areva (2-14); GBR (7-9)
vs. Team Dennis Conner (6-10).</TE>
<TE>   Alinghi was privileged to pick its opponent, raising specters of
Team New Zealand's 5-0 blitz of Prada in the final match three years
ago. The Italians will see the core of that invincible Kiwi crew now
sailing for Switzerland: skipper Russell Coutts and tactician Brad
Butterworth, along with Simon Daubney, Dean Phipps, Warwick Fleury
and Murray Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Michel Bonnefous, the executive director of Alinghi, said: "It
wasn't an easy decision. We expect it to be an extraordinary series
of matches, sure to incite passion and excitement in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Alinghi beat Prada in the first round, then forfeited in the
second round, taking a day off after clinching first place.</TE>
<TE>   The lower four offer a nostalgic match between Britain and the New
York Yacht Club, which is where this whole thing started 151 years
ago. The Brits are back in the competition for the first time in 15
years and doing about as well as could be expected with a young,
inexperienced crew.</TE>
<TE>   Conner's team is doing worse than expected.</TE>
<TE>   The man who lost the Cup to Australia while sailing for the NYYC
in '83 made amends after two decades but apparently hasn't changed
the club's luck at getting it back.</TE>
<TE>   With adequate funding this time, he was able to build two boats.
Unfortunately, one sank and the other is slow.</TE>
<TE>   In his only appearance on board so far, Conner, 60, relieved
helmsman Ken Read for one race and beat Mascalzone Latino on its way
out the door. The veteran team has been scrambling every way it can
-- requesting a postponement because of broken gear, protesting that
a losing race shouldn't have been run because the wind was too low --
but it is about out of options.</TE>
<TE>   Read said, hopefully: "We're concentrating on new speed techniques
and some fine-tuning on crew roles as we prepare for the
quarterfinals."</TE>
<TE>   But their best hope is USA 77, the other Stars &amp; Stripes boat that
was salvaged after sinking off Long Beach in July and has been
rebuilt and tested in Auckland.</TE>
<TE>   The teams may change boats for the quarterfinals, but they don't
have to say so until next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Alinghi keeps ticking. Whatever flag the Kiwis are
flying, they're still the team to beat.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Acquires South Korea's Hong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez and Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The smiles have yet to disappear from the faces of the Galaxy since
the club won its first Major League Soccer championship Oct. 20.
Monday's announcement that it had finally acquired the rights to
South Korean defender Hong Myung Bo has only made the grins grow
wider.</LD>
<LD>   The allocation of the 33-year-old Hong not only appeases the
Southland's burgeoning Korean community -- which filled Staples
Center with 18,000 fans at 4 a.m. to watch the South Korea-Turkey
World Cup game on the arena's big screens -- team officials say it
makes the Galaxy a better team.</LD>
<LD>   "He's going to make us stronger in the back," Galaxy Coach Sigi
Schmid said. "He's a very good long passer of the ball and he has a
tremendous amount of experience.</LD>
<TE>   "Next year we have a tremendous amount of games with the CONCACAF
Champions Cup and league so you need another quality defender because
you don't know who's going to be hurt. Plus, we're going to be
missing [Danny] Califf for the U.S. national team at times next year
and we're going to be missing [Tyrone] Marshall for Jamaica, so we
had to get deeper in the back."</TE>
<TE>   Hong, a veteran of four World Cups, will become the first Korean
player in the seven-year history of MLS after leaving his homeland
team, the Pohang Steelers of the K-League. Per MLS policy, contract
details were not released.</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy captain Cobi Jones remembered the 6-foot, 161-pound Hong,
who was awarded the Bronze Ball at the World Cup as the tournament's
third-best overall player, as being "very physical and good
tactically."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I think it's very important that when you're bringing
in players you don't want to tear apart your team to do it. He's a
good match for our team."</TE>
<TE>   The last time the Galaxy made such a high-profile signing --
Mexican forward Luis Hernandez in 2000 -- the Galaxy paid dearly by
having to part with three starters in Joey Franchino, Clint Mathis
and Roy Myers.</TE>
<TE>   No such sacrifices will be made this time, Galaxy General Manager
Doug Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   "Will we have to make moves? Yeah, but at this point we don't
anticipate any significant moves," Hamilton said. "We never replaced
Greg Vanney [who was sold by MLS to Bastia in the French first
division] last year. We replaced Greg with a minimal salary player so
we're just basically sliding someone into that avenue."</TE>
<TE>   Sarachan Takes Over Fire</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Fire chose U.S. national team assistant Dave Sarachan,
48, as its coach, replacing Bob Bradley, who last month left to
become coach of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Steve Nicol, who as interim coach of the New
England Revolution led the team to the 2002 championship game, said
he has reached agreement to return as coach -- minus the interim tag.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything has been arranged," Nicol, 40, told Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the legal stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution is expected to make the formal announcement
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Nicol played for 15 seasons with Liverpool, winning virtually
every honor available to the English Premier League club, and also
played 27 games for Scotland, including those in the 1986 World Cup
in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Sarachan's playing credentials are more modest, being limited to
two seasons with the Rochester Lancers of the old North American
Soccer League, but the new Fire mentor has proven successful as a
coach.</TE>
<TE>   He was coach of Cornell for nine seasons, and later was an
assistant under U.S. Coach Bruce Arena at Washington D.C. United,
before becoming Arena's top assistant with the national team.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil Goes Retro</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a friendly game against South Korea in two weeks and
not having a coach, Brazil's soccer federation (CBF) called Mario
"Lobo" Zagallo, 71, out of retirement to take charge of the world
champions for the Nov. 20 game in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Zagallo won the World Cup as a player in 1958 and 1962, coached
the victorious Brazilian team of 1970 and was an assistant coach on
the winning team of 1994. In addition, he coached Brazil to fourth
place in 1974 and second place in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The CBF is expected to name a full-time replacement for former
coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Trapattoni Safe</TE>
<TE>   Giovanni Trapattoni, the beleaguered coach of Italy, was given a
vote of confidence by the Italian soccer federation (FIGC) despite a
series of poor results, including a recent loss to Wales.</TE>
<TE>   Trapattoni met with Franco Carraro, president of the FIGC, in
Rome, after which Giancarlo Abete, the federation's vice president,
said the coach's contract, which runs to the 2004 European
Championship in Portugal, would be honored in full.</TE>

were beckoning so there wasn't a chance to ask the teenager about
Kournikova, but it's an educated guess Poruskevich doesn't want to be
like her either.</LD>
<TE>   The New Russians don't want to be like the Old(er) Russians. The
New Ukrainians don't want to be like the New Russians or the Old
Ukrainians.</TE>
<TE>   These suspicions were confirmed during an afternoon visit to the
South Bay Tennis Center in Torrance, where legendary coach Robert
Lansdorp conducted consecutive lessons with Sharapova, Myskina and
Porushkevich.</TE>
<TE>   Someone made a casual remark to Poruskevich -- who has been ranked
among the top dozen players in the USTA's 14-and-under division --
about being around the likes of Myskina and Sharapova. What's it
like? Inspiring?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just my own player," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lansdorp picked up on that.</TE>
<TE>   "They might respect them, but they don't want to be like them," he
said. "It's interesting how quickly she said, 'I want to be myself.'
They all do that. They never want to be compared. They want everyone
else to say, 'Oh yeah, I want to be like her, like Karina or Maria.'
"</TE>
<TE>   The internal competition is sometimes as fascinating as the
external. Sharapova appeared distracted during her brief interview
next to the tennis court during Myskina's lesson with Lansdorp.
Though she was answering questions, she could hear his loud voice,
counting the number of targets that Myskina was striking.</TE>
<TE>   "Four out of four. Five out of five."</TE>
<TE>   Hmm. Was her South Bay Tennis Center record really in danger?
Suddenly, Sharapova realized what the intrepid coach was doing,
teasing her on purpose. She turned toward him and started giggling,
saying: "Oh Robert, I'm counting!"</TE>
<TE>   Becoming a New Russian or a Newer Russian isn't such a terrible
aspiration.</TE>
<TE>   Two 21-year-old Russians qualified for the 16-player singles field
in the season-ending WTA Championships at Staples Center, which start
Wednesday. Elena Dementieva, a semifinalist in 2000, and Myskina
earned spots in the $3-million, single-elimination event. A third
Russian player, Elena Likhovtseva, 27, is playing doubles with Cara
Black of Zimbabwe. There was a chance Kournikova could have played
doubles but her partner Martina Hingis withdrew because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   If Olga Morozova, who reached the Wimbledon and French Open finals
in 1974, is the grandmother of Russian tennis, then Kournikova, 21,
is the older sister of the family. Call her the Russian Marcia Brady,
wildly popular and the envy of the younger sisters.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the Russian sisterhood is a fairly large group.
There are eight Russian female players ranked in the top 50 in the
world and 10 in the top 100. Last year, there were eight in the top
100. Myskina finished 2001 ranked 59th, and she is 11th this week,
having won a tournament in Bahia, Brazil, in September and reached
consecutive grass-court finals, at Birmingham and Eastbourne, in the
lead-up to Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't been the most dramatic Russian leap forward, however.</TE>
<TE>   Teenager Vera Zvonareva, as a qualifier, reached the fourth round
at the French Open and won the first set against eventual champion
Serena Williams. Zvonareva went from 371 last year to 45, and Dinara
Safin, younger sister of 2000 U.S. Open men's champion Marat Safin,
went from 394 in 2001 to 68. Sharapova, who made her WTA debut at
Indian Wells, is 231.</TE>
<TE>   For the sake of comparison, the United States has 11 players
ranked in the top 50 and 16 in the top 100. Traditional powers such
as Spain (seven in top 100), France (seven in top 100) and Germany
(six in top 100) lag behind the U.S. and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, the Soviet Union had five players ranked among the top
100, but breaking it down in post-breakup terms, three were from
Ukraine, one from Belarus and the other from Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not necessarily a jealousy, but they are competing with each
other without playing each other," Lansdorp said. "Myskina couldn't
wait to be No. 1 in Russia. On Sept. 3 finally she became No. 1 in
Russia [passing Dementieva]. It was a big thing to her. Nobody wants
to be compared to Kournikova."</TE>
<TE>   Myskina and Kournikova were once close, having played together at
the famous Moscow Spartak club. Despite frequent trips to train with
Lansdorp, Myskina has retained her Russian roots, while Kournikova
long ago left Moscow for Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask if we compare with her on the court, I don't think so
right now," Myskina said. "She's not really good right now. She was
injured, and of course, I was injured too and it's real difficult to
be back. It's hard. For her, I think she's tired of all this.</TE>
<TE>   "We put pressure on her because a lot of good Russian players
right now play. I think it's a lot of pressure. It's hard for her
more than anyone. I feel sorry for her sometimes. I can say nothing
bad about her."</TE>
<TE>   Myskina's father and trainer, Andrey, was the one who sought out
Lansdorp and their association quickly paid off with improved
results. ("I'm better known in Moscow than Palos Verdes," Lansdorp
said, joking.) He added power to her groundstrokes, worked on her
serve and volleys, and is thrilled with her backhand down the line,
calling it "a thing of beauty."</TE>
<TE>   Myskina's fans were saying the same thing when she recently posed
for GQ magazine. Although Dementieva and Daniela Hantuchova of
Slovakia looked provocative in their shots, Myskina was the one who
got most of the attention. Maybe it had something to do with the Lady
Godiva look, as she appeared to be naked on a horse.</TE>
<TE>   She liked the final result, as did her boyfriend and coach, Jens
Gerlach. "It's nothing that bad," she said. "It's not Playboy."</TE>
<TE>   Galina Myskina had a different reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom was looking a half-minute and then she says, 'Put this
magazine away. I have to think,' " Myskina said. "That's what she
says. My father was more nice. My boyfriend was with me, so it was
more easy. He liked [it] a lot."</TE>
<TE>   The other players had some questions for her at the next tour stop
in Brazil, Myskina said.</TE>
<TE>   "Kim Clijsters came to me, 'Are you naked on the horse?' " Myskina
said. "I'm like, 'No, I wasn't naked. I was with underwear.' She
said, 'We couldn't see.' There still was underwear there. She's like,
'OK that's cool.'</TE>
<TE>   "Actually boys [reacted] more. I know why. A lot of guys send me
e-mails, saying, 'That was good. That was incredible.' Lot of mail,
for me, that's funny."</TE>
<TE>   Internet recognition was one thing. Myskina won the event in Bahia
that week, the second title of her career, and is close to cracking
the top 10 for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   She was asked about the implications for her country if a Russian
woman became No. 1 or won a Grand Slam tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope it means a lot for Russia," Myskina said. "We try to
represent our country in a good way because I don't think a lot of
people believe Russia is a nice country, especially after a couple of
things that happened there. I really worry about Russia. That's one
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I always try to say something good. That it's really nice there.
[People] are scared to go there, for sure. But I can tell you it's
nothing scary.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all working hard because we just try to be better than
anyone. I know Maria because she practices hard and she wants to play
good because we are in the top, so she wants to compete with us. She
is good and wants to be better."</TE>

<TE>   True Anna Kournikova fans are aware that the Russian heartthrob
won back-to-back year-end doubles titles with Martina Hingis, who had
to pull out of this year's event because of an injury. Sorry, Anna

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Martin's Winston Cup championship hopes received a setback
Monday when NASCAR penalized his team 25 points for a rules violation
at North Carolina Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Martin finished second in Sunday's race in Rockingham, but his car
failed inspection afterward because the left-front springs did not
meet the minimum number of coils.</LD>
<LD>   Martin was docked 25 championship points, Jack Roush was docked 25
car owner points and crew chief Ben Leslie was fined $5,000.</LD>
<TE>   Martin is in second place in the standings, and the penalty drops
him 112 points behind series leader Tony Stewart with only two races
remaining. He had cut the lead to 87 points after the race, in which
Stewart struggled to a 14th-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   Martin was fined 46 driver points in 1990 for an illegal
carburetor spacer found on his Roush Racing Ford after a race at
Richmond International Raceway. Martin lost the Winston Cup
championship that year to Dale Earnhardt by 26 points.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie was fined $50,000 after Martin's winning car was too low in
post-race inspection following the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor
Speedway in May. And he was fined $1,000 for an unapproved window
strap at Talladega in October.</TE>

<TE>   Luke Donald, a rookie from England, won the Southern Farm Bureau
Classic at Madison, Miss., when the final round was canceled because
of rain.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first PGA Tour victory for Donald, who completed the
three rounds in 15-under-par 201, a stroke ahead of Deane Pappas.
Brad Elder, who led the first two rounds, was third at 203.</TE>
<TE>   The Senior Slam, the first of four unofficial money events that
complete the Senior PGA Tour schedule, will be played at Superstition
Mountain Golf and Country Club east of Phoenix this weekend in a
last-minute switch from Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   Bahamian organizers determined last month that they wouldn't be
able to stage this year's competition.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   A jury in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., refused to award any money to Don
King in his fight with rival promoter Bob Arum over rights to boxer
Julio Cesar Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   The jury rejected claims that Arum's Las Vegas-based Top Rank Inc.
interfered with three agreements between King and Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   King had been seeking $8 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   The son of baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams is being sued in
Massachusetts by a promoter who contends he is owed more money from
the sale of NBA sports memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   Lane Forman is suing John Henry Williams for his portion of the

<TE>   Rollie Dykstra, the University of La Verne quarterback who
suffered a head injury in an Oct. 19 game, was removed from a
respirator and was breathing on his own.</TE>
<TE>   Dykstra, 24, remains comatose and in serious condition at Pomona
Valley Hospital Medical Center. Martin Cervantes, attorney for
Dykstra's father, Roland Sr., said the younger Dykstra can move his
limbs and occasionally opens his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Don MacLean, UCLA's all-time basketball leading scorer, will be

<KH>UCLA REPORT</KH>
<HD>White Says He's Ready</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are the words Manuel White longed to say for the last month: "I
can play."</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore running back believes he can return Saturday after
being sidelined since suffering a pulled hamstring against Oregon
State on Oct. 5.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel like I'm learning how to play football all over again," he
said of the layoff.</LD>
<TE>   White ran sprints before practice and carried the ball in
non-contact drills. He is working out at tailback and fullback.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll do whatever they need me to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   White started the first four games at fullback before making his
first start at tailback against Oregon State. His injury opened the
door for Tyler Ebell, who rushed for 203 yards in the game and has
strung together five consecutive games of more than 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Ebell doesn't mind sharing the load with the
240-pound White.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll complement each other," Ebell said. "We'll be thunder and
lightening."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It appears safety Jibril Raymo (shoulder) and cornerback Matt
Clark (toe) will be able to return to the lineup after sitting out
the Washington game. Their presence is key because cornerback Matt
Ware (hamstring) is questionable.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches are tapering back on contact drills this week to cut down
on injuries. Lower-body work in the weight room also will be
curtailed to rest tired legs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our [13th] consecutive week of practice, so we have to be
smart," Coach Bob Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drew Olson will be the starting quarterback again, although Toledo
said Matt Moore probably will play.</TE>
<TE>   However, Toledo said the same thing last week. Moore, who played
the entire game in UCLA's victory over Stanford a week earlier, never
left the bench against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to get Matt in," Toledo said, "but there was a turn of
events and we couldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   As the third quarter drew to a close with UCLA ahead, 27-14,
Toledo told Moore to get ready. The coach had second thoughts after
the Huskies connected on a 41-yard pass play on the first play of the
fourth quarter that led to a field goal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Niusulu will miss practice today and perhaps Wednesday
because of court dates.</TE>
<TE>   The freshman defensive tackle has a pre-preliminary hearing today
on felony battery charges stemming from a fight at a Barstow drive-in
theater in July. The preliminary hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The new sod at Spaulding Field received solid reviews. Ebell even
compared it to a day at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I like it a lot -- except for the sand on top of the grass," he
said. "But they said that will be gone soon. I never complained about
the field before. So it's fine with me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ball was announced as Pacific 10 Conference defensive player
of the week after getting three sacks against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The junior defensive end has 10 sacks and is approaching the
school record of 13 set by Carnell Lake in 1987.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Football Coach John Robinson of Nevada Las Vegas said Monday that he
would address an awkward situation that occurred Saturday, when
assistant head coach John Jackson left the Rebels' game early to get
to a boxing card in which he was promoting a fighter.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson, who earns $119,600 annually for overseeing UNLV's running
game, left Sam Boyd Stadium with about three minutes left in
regulation and the Rebels leading Wyoming by eight points. Wyoming
rallied to tie the score before UNLV won in overtime, 49-48.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson said he thought the game was "in hand" when he left to
drive to the MGM Grand for the Marco Antonio Barrera-Johnny Tapia
featherweight fight. Jackson is Barrera's promoter.</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, a former USC assistant under Robinson from 1976 to '81,
was quoted last week as saying, "They need me more at the football
game," when asked if he would leave early to attend the fight.
Robinson said he had not been aware of Jackson's early departure at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said a conflict occurred when the date of the fight and
the time of UNLV's game were changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It put the pressure on him, and he made that decision [to
leave]," Robinson said. "That won't ever happen again."</TE>

<HD>USC Is Beyond Air Essentials</HD>
<DH>No longer adjusting to transition, Palmer &amp; Co. look
forward to prolific offense's new wrinkles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The play is called "Zombie," an appropriate moniker for the pass-run
hybrid that drained the will of hapless Oregon defensive backs when
USC unveiled it against the Ducks on Oct. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Trojan quarterback Carson Palmer threw repeatedly along and behind
the line of scrimmage to freshman wide receiver Mike Williams, who
caught passes in full stride before blocks from offensive linemen and
other receivers sprang him for big gains.</LD>
<LD>   "This was a breakout game," Williams said after catching 13 passes
for 226 yards and two touchdowns in the Trojans' 44-33 victory.</LD>
<TE>   Williams was not talking about his performance. He was describing
an offense that produced 608 yards, the most under second-year Coach
Pete Carroll and offensive coordinator Norm Chow.</TE>
<TE>   It took 12 games last year and eight this season, but USC finally
appears balanced, multidimensional and positively unpredictable on
offense.</TE>
<TE>   Against Oregon, Palmer mixed standard drops, play-action fakes and
his improving freelance skills to pass for a school-record 448 yards
and five touchdowns. Senior tailback Justin Fargas, starting for the
first time, gained 139 yards and scored on what once was classified
at USC as a standard-issue 15-yard sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Chow, the architect of high-powered offenses at Brigham Young and
North Carolina State before Carroll hired him, said major adjustments
were not required. Only time.</TE>
<TE>   "The players are a year older and a year wiser," Chow said. "They
just understand better."</TE>
<TE>   USC averaged 314 yards and 24.8 points a game last season with a
porous offensive line and a depleted backfield. Palmer was sacked 36
times. Tailback Sultan McCullough suffered an abdominal strain, sat
out six games and still finished with a team-high 410 yards as the
Trojans averaged only 87.7 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's far more difficult when you come in and the kids have to
change over to a new system," Chow said. "You'd like to do more, but
we did what we could with the people we had."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he'd spent the off-season, "restructuring the things
that we were doing on offense."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: Carroll restructured the coaching staff.</TE>
<TE>   Fiery Kennedy Pola, who seems to get the most out of McCullough,
was moved from special teams to running backs, the unit he'd coached
under Paul Hackett in 2000. Steve Sarkisian, an offensive assistant
last season, was put in charge of quarterbacks. Carroll also hired
offensive line coach Tim Davis from Wisconsin, allowing Keith Uperesa
to concentrate on tackles and tight ends.</TE>
<TE>   Rotated coaches, new players such as Fargas, Williams and freshman
tackle Winston Justice, and an injury-free Palmer have helped the
Trojans flourish.</TE>
<TE>   Tenth-ranked USC is 6-2 overall and 4-1 in the Pacific 10
Conference. The Trojans are averaging 420.5 yards and 31 points a
game. Palmer has been sacked only 16 times. Fargas, a transfer from
Michigan, and McCullough have produced big games for a team averaging
116.9 yards rushing, and injury-free Malaefou MacKenzie is a multiple
threat at fullback.</TE>
<TE>   Chow, who calls the plays, said the Trojans' prowess on offense is
the result of a collective brain trust.</TE>
<TE>   "This is USC's offense, not mine," Chow said. "One guy has to make
the calls -- you can't have a panel discussion before every play. But
Pete and I talk all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer's execution of the offensive scheme has produced a
three-game winning streak and propelled the fifth-year senior into
the Heisman Trophy race. Against Cal, he passed for 289 yards and two
touchdowns. He passed for 348 yards and four touchdowns against
Washington before torching Oregon and conquering his personal demons
at Autzen Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is so comfortable with the base stuff we do, Coach Chow
can add in kinks and a couple of tricks here and there every week,"
said Palmer, who needs one touchdown pass against Stanford on
Saturday to tie the school record of 58 set by Rob Johnson in
1991-94.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, who averages 16.4 yards a catch, flanker Keary Colbert
(14.2) and wide receiver Kareem Kelly (10.8) provide Palmer with one
of the most productive pass-catching trios in the nation. The three
have combined for 126 receptions or nearly 16 a game.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' contribution against Oregon was obvious on the
statistics sheet. Colbert and Kelly's outstanding blocking was not.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hearing whispers that blocking was a question-mark part of
my game, so I try and work on that every day," Kelly said. "It's
great to catch a touchdown pass, but it's also great to know that you
helped with a long run or touchdown because of a great block."</TE>
<TE>   Offensive linemen and tight end Alex Holmes also are getting used
to the feeling.</TE>
<TE>   A line that began the season with a perceived lack of depth is
proving capable and versatile. From the opener against Auburn, when
senior Derek Graf stepped in at guard for injured Zach Wilson and
Fred Matua, the line has provided Palmer with protection and running
backs with room to run.</TE>
<TE>   The current configuration features junior Norm Katnik at center,
senior Wilson and junior Lenny Vandermade at guard and Justice and
junior Jacob Rogers at tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Eric Torres has started at both tackle spots and right
guard when needed.</TE>
<TE>   "We went through a lot of growing pains last season, learning a
new system," Rogers said. "This year, we knew what we were getting
into.</TE>
<TE>   "We run a lot of the same stuff, but just put a little window
dressing on it here and there and make it look different. The core
plays stay the same."</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, who leads the team in rushing with 582 yards, and
Fargas, who has gained 264, give USC a presence that is helping erase
memories of last season's debacle when the Trojans had to use
fullback Sunny Byrd at tailback.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough carried a career-high 39 times for 176 yards against
California on Oct. 12. Fargas had a career day against Oregon and is
likely to start against Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   "He's popping for six and seven yards and getting us into
situations where it's second and three and we can take shots," Palmer
said of Fargas. "If we don't get a first down, we still have the
opportunity to be in a third-and-three situation with a pretty good
chance of getting the first down."</TE>
<TE>   USC hopes to continue its momentum on offense as it finishes the
regular season against Stanford, No. 25 Arizona State, UCLA and No. 9
Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer said the players on offense are looking forward to the
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely going to be fun," Palmer said. "We just want to
see what Coach Chow comes up with next."</TE>

<HD>Johnson Has a Message</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC is coming off a bye week. Tampa Bay Buccaneer wide receiver
Keyshawn Johnson is just beginning one.</LD>
<LD>   So Johnson stopped by Howard Jones Field on Monday, watched the
final 30 minutes of a practice that lasted a bit more than an hour
and addressed the team afterward at the behest of Coach Pete Carroll.</LD>
<LD>   USC, ranked 10th in the Associated Press poll, moved up to No. 9
in the BCS rankings earlier in the day.</LD>
<TE>   "I told them it's all in front of them for the most part," said
Johnson, an All-American at USC during the Trojans' last Rose Bowl
season in 1995. "I don't think this university has been to a major
bowl game since I left. They have an opportunity. Don't let it pass
them up."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said he was pleased by Johnson's appearance: "I like that
they're coming back because they feel good about what they're
seeing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said he was impressed by the play of wide receiver Mike
Williams, the 6-foot-5, 223-pound freshman from Tampa, Fla., who has
a team-high 50 receptions.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as he doesn't let it go to his head and he continues to
keep playing, he'll be a force to be reckoned with for a long time,"
Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   How big of a force?</TE>
<TE>   "He could become one of the best receivers here," Johnson said
with a laugh. "He could be like the second-best receiver to ever play
here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman lineman Fred Matua took repetitions with the scout team
for the first time since having arthroscopic surgery on his right
knee on Oct. 3.... Wide receiver Sandy Fletcher returned to practice
after missing the last week because of a sprained ankle.... USC's
Nov. 16 home game against Arizona State will kick off at 4 p.m. and
be televised nationally by TBS.</TE>

<HD>Ward Receives Vote of Confidence From USOC</HD>
<DH>Executive committee supports CEO, who came under scrutiny
for his membership at Augusta.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lloyd Ward, the U.S. Olympic Committee's chief executive, has won a
vote of confidence from the USOC's policy-making executive committee
on the sensitive issue of his membership in Augusta National Golf
Club, which does not have any female members.</LD>
<LD>   But several sources predicted that a reprieve from controversy
over the issue -- and, more broadly, Ward's tenure as CEO -- will be
short-lived.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think there's anyone who was in that room who doesn't
think that [Ward's Augusta membership] isn't going to come up again,"
one USOC insider said Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity and
adding, "If not stated, there's certainly now a time clock ticking."</LD>
<TE>   Ward is one of a handful of African American members at Augusta,
site each spring of the Masters. The club is under pressure, in
particular from the National Council of Women's Organizations, to
admit women members.</TE>
<TE>   In an Oct. 7 statement, Ward pledged to "aggressively work" for
reform from within.</TE>
<TE>   Last Friday, after deliberating behind closed doors, the executive
committee said Ward had its "strong support" because of what it
called "his principled position on the issue and his commitment to
the inclusion of women."</TE>
<TE>   That statement was timed to ensure that the issue did not deflect
attention from the vote Saturday by the USOC board of directors for
New York as the U.S. candidate for the 2012 Olympics. It also,
several sources said, reflected the lobbying of several influential
USOC delegates, who see in Ward perhaps a last chance to match the
USOC's CEO job with an executive boasting experience in corporate
matters. Ward arrived at the USOC one year ago; his prior experience
includes a stint as CEO of Maytag Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In other action at the USOC meeting, which wrapped up Sunday in
Colorado Springs, Colo., boxing's governing body was put on probation
for failing to meet certain managerial and financial obligations. It
was given until Dec. 1 to comply or face the prospect of losing its
standing as a national governing body.</TE>

<HD>Westchester to Face Recruiting Allegations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Westchester High, the reigning state boys' basketball champion, will
appear before a special City Section rules committee today on
allegations it has recruited top players from other schools.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Reese of Carson High and Gabriel Pruitt of Compton Centennial
transferred to Westchester this fall under unusual circumstances,
officials from their former schools contend. If the committee
determines a violation has occurred, either or both players could be
deemed ineligible and the Comet basketball program could be punished.</LD>
<LD>   This is the fourth time in three years Westchester has been
formally accused of recruiting. The Comet basketball program was put
on probation two years ago when it was determined a player
participated in a summer tournament with Westchester before the
transfer from his former school was official. That player, guard
Hassan Adams, was the leading scorer on the Comets' state
title-winning team last season and is now at Arizona on a basketball
scholarship.</LD>
<TE>   Westchester has had a winning boys' basketball team for years but
only recently has gained national prominence -- an improvement some
opposing coaches credit to the program's relationship with Nike. The
Comets are one of about 15 teams in the nation outfitted head-to-toe
for free by the shoe and apparel giant, and they travel to several
showcase tournaments with Nike footing at least part of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The free gear and national exposure are hard for athletes and
their parents to resist, critics say. Last year, the champion Comets
didn't have a player from within the school's primary attendance
area.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Halpern, assistant commissioner of the City Section, said the
10-member panel of athletic directors and principals, convened
especially for this occasion, will be studying "how kids are getting
there, and is it being done legally."</TE>
<TE>   Carson administrators are accusing Westchester of multiple rules
violations in the transfer of Reese, a 6-foot-4 sophomore who last
season distinguished himself as one of the best young forwards in the
section. They say Reese was recruited by Comet assistant Marlon
Morton and that his father, Ray Reese Sr., was coached on how to get
his son legally transferred by Westchester Athletic Director Brian
Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the current school year began, Reese's father filed
for an "opportunity transfer for social adjustment," a complex
transfer in which a student requests to leave a school because the
student feels at risk from gang members or other students.</TE>
<TE>   Typically in such cases, Carson officials said, parents talk in
"layman's terms" with school administrators when expressing concern
about their child. "Not too many people come in off the street and
for a specific type of transfer" like the Reeses did, Carson
assistant principal Rosie Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Carson officials say Reese told them his son was threatened at
gunpoint and that personal items, including a cell phone, were
stolen. School administrators say they do not have a record of the
incidents.</TE>
<TE>   Reese's younger brother, a freshman, remains at Carson. "We would
like to know why Carson was such an unsafe situation for [Reese], but
it is OK for his brother," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Carson administrators say Henderson, who is also a varsity
basketball assistant, left a voice mail for Carson basketball Coach
Richard Masson saying that he told Reese's father how to ask for the
specific transfer request.</TE>
<TE>   The City Section prohibits athletic officials from personal
contact with a student from another school before the student has
checked out of that school.</TE>
<TE>   "Something ought to be done other than a slap on the wrist,"
Masson said. Phone calls seeking comment to Reese Sr., Reese Jr. and
Henderson were not returned.</TE>
<TE>   Reese has been denied a transfer on three occasions -- first by
Martinez, then by Carson Principal Doug Waybright, then by the
district that has jurisdiction over Carson, Local District K of the
L.A. Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   After Reese was denied by the district, his father filed for an
official change of residence. City Section students are allowed to
transfer once without losing athletic eligibility if they change
residences within the boundaries of the section. But Carson is
challenging whether Reese resides at the given address.</TE>
<TE>   Schools are expected to verify a student's residence through the
Pupil Service and Attendance program at each LAUSD campus. A PSA
worker who recently checked Reese's claimed address was unsatisfied.</TE>
<TE>   "They saw his toothbrush there, his tennis shoes ... they didn't
see a lot of clothes," said Morton, a Westchester assistant. "That's
the one thing they mentioned."</TE>
<TE>   Morton said Reese stays at the apartment with a cousin during the
week and "on the weekends, he goes back home" to live with his father
in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Morton is required to appear at today's meeting because he coached
Reese on a summer league team and allegedly recruited him for
Westchester. Morton was accused of recruiting Adams under similar
circumstances two years ago. He denies recruiting Reese, saying
Reese's father wanted his son to play for Westchester after watching
the Comets rout Carson, 94-66, last February in a City Section
playoff quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   Masson, the Carson coach, said Westchester uses its unique
relationship with Nike as a recruiting tool. "Would you rather go
play where they go or with us? ... We're going to Modesto," he said.
"They're going to get five pairs of shoes and sweats we'll get maybe
one pair of shoes if we're lucky."</TE>
<TE>   Had Reese stayed, Carson, who still has Maryland-bound senior
Ekene Ibekwe, would have been expected to challenge Westchester for
the City title.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of Pruitt's transfer to Westchester began circulating last
April, shortly after he helped Centennial reach the Division III
state championship game.</TE>
<TE>   During the summer, the 6-1 junior guard played for several teams,
including California Team Select, a Nike-sponsored team that has had
several Westchester players in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Morton helped coach Nike Sports Express, another summer league
team on which Pruitt played, and said he is a longtime friend of
Pruitt's uncle.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never, ever talked about Gabe coming to Westchester,"
Morton said. "If a kid is satisfied where he's at, he's not going to
leave."</TE>
<TE>   Centennial Coach Rod Palmer expressed doubt about that, saying,
"Everyone in the basketball arena knows it's not coincidental. His
dad actually never gave me a reason [for transferring], but I know it
was a basketball-related thing."</TE>
<TE>   The City rules committee is also expected to inspect Pruitt's
transfer record. Pruitt initially lived in the Manual Arts High
district but is believed to have used his one inter-district transfer
to go to Centennial, in the Compton Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   If it is determined that he has used his one allowable transfer,
Pruitt would have had to move into the Westchester attendance area to
be eligible this season.</TE>
<TE>   Westchester also received a third transfer, Jerard Moret, a 6-4
sophomore from Pacific Hills. Pacific Hills did not file a complaint.</TE>
