<HD>When It Comes to Vodka, the E-Nose Knows Better</HD>

<LD>It didn't take a "D" in high school chemistry to tell me that I had
no aptitude for science. I had known it since I was 10, when a
combination of home chemicals I had mixed together for fun caught
fire and almost burned down the kitchen.</LD>
<LD>   It was during the Depression and not a good time to set fire to
anything that was going to cost money to repair. I was told never to
touch any chemicals anywhere ever again for my whole life or I would
go to hell and the devil would eat me.</LD>
<LD>   I mention this as an excuse for failing to apply the scientific
method to a recent vodka-sniffing test I conducted at home. After
having that failure pointed out in a barrage of e-mails, I followed
up with a more orderly method of determining the danger of vodka
fumes. Call it Vodka Sniffing II: The Sequel.</LD>
<TE>   It involved the cooperation of Pasadena's internationally renowned
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an electronic nose that has been tested in
space and the physical chemist who helped create it. We're talking
big time here.</TE>
<TE>   Some weeks ago, fumes from a bottle of 80-proof Russian vodka
caused the evacuation of the Fluor Daniel engineering company in
Aliso Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   The bottle had been sent by one employee to another and it broke
either in shipping or handling. Its fumes drifted like fairy mist
into the air.</TE>
<TE>   Six mail-room workers complained of wooziness from the vapor, so
the company's buildings were evacuated. A hazardous material team
ultimately determined that it was not a toxic substance from Syria
but fumes from a bottle of booze.</TE>
<TE>   I wondered why vodka vapor could make anyone woozy and bought four
different brands of vodka to sniff for myself. It was after I wrote
about it, mentioning the names of the four vodkas, that I was
informed that none of the vodkas was Russian, which was the culprit
at Fluor Daniel. "A scientist, you ain't," one person wrote, summing
up the general attitude of all the others. So I turned to more
sophisticated means of testing.</TE>
<TE>   I learned that Dr. Margaret Ryan at JPL was creator of an
air-sniffing device that had gone into orbit with John Glenn aboard
the space shuttle Discovery four years ago. It consists of 32 sensors
capable of detecting chemical spills or leaks aboard a space craft.
Scientists at the California Institute of Technology developed the
sensors, and a team created by Ryan developed the e-nose.</TE>
<TE>   I won't go into her background except to say that her amazing
qualifications as a chemist have not dulled a keen sense of humor.
Why else would someone who wrote "Internal Reflection Flash
Photolysis Study of the Photochemistry of Eosin at TIO2 Semiconductor
Electrodes" allow a journalist into her lab carrying a bottle of
vodka?</TE>
<TE>   After leading me on a tour of the place, Ryan, 51, showed me the
e-nose. It's about half the size of a cigar box and contains a pump
and a computer in addition to the sensors.</TE>
<TE>   A smaller version, Nose 2, is due out in November.</TE>
<TE>   The vodka I brought with me was 80-proof Stolichnaya, a Russian
beverage its drinkers refer to as "Stoli," as in, "Slide me down a
shot of Stoli, barkeep, and the babe on the third stool too."</TE>
<TE>   But before we tested the booze, we used the e-nose to determine
the differences, if any, between Coke and Pepsi. Ryan poured an
amount of each into separate beakers and connected them with plastic
tubes to the e-nose. Each product was tested individually. Margie
Homer, a 39-year-old physical chemist, sat at an attached computer
and called up the data that detailed the results.</TE>
<TE>   After studying a maze of mysterious, multicolored graphs and lines
on the screen, and determining there was a substantial difference,
Ryan stepped back and announced, "Pepsi has less of something than
Coke."</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly the stuff of Nobel Prizes, but enough for now. It
would take weeks to determine what Coke had more of than Pepsi and it
wasn't worth the time unless you were Mr. Pepsi.</TE>
<TE>   After exchanging stories of the disgusting alcoholic mixtures we
drank in college, it was time to test the (shudder) dangers of vodka
fumes.</TE>
<TE>   To begin, we smelled the vodka with our human noses with no ill
effects. Then Ryan tested the vodka through the e-nose, first with
lab alcohol, then with a bubble wrap often used to transport fragile
items, and finally with another plastic wrap they referred to as "the
pink stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Nothing happened at first, but then as the pink stuff began
soaking up the vodka, the computer graphs registered a chemical
reaction. We took turns smelling the concoction and waited.</TE>
<TE>   After a few moments, Ryan said, "It went right to my brain."
Margie Homer said, "It's affected my eyes." JPL Publicist Carolina
Martinez said, "I feel a little woozy," then added, "but maybe it's
because I missed lunch." I had a slight headache.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what," Homer said, "we're talking each other into it."</TE>
<TE>   That was one of the suggestions made following the Fluor Daniel
event, that one person reacted to the fumes and the others suffered
from mass vodka hysteria.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Ryan said, "it's the pink stuff soaking up something from
the vodka." Homer finally agreed: "The vodka reacted to the pink
stuff and created pink-stuff fumes we didn't like."</TE>
<TE>   There you have it. More weeks would have been required to refine
the testing, but I doubt that either Ryan or JPL would have allowed
it. I left the bottle of Stoli there for possible future
experimentation in combination with the pink stuff.</TE>
<TE>   I'm done with science now. No sense in further risking the
possibility of going to hell and being eaten by the devil.</TE>

<HD>In the Event of Children Interruptus, Stay Calm</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a sweltering afternoon. The kids were in the backyard
engrossed in play. Inside, the parents exchanged knowing glances and
dashed to the bedroom.</LD>
<LD>   They closed the door, stripped naked and stretched out on the bed
next to each other. Just as they were starting to caress and kiss,
the still air was shattered by the voice of their 6-year-old blasting
in. "Here's the mail!" their daughter announced with the neighbor
girl in tow.</LD>
<LD>   "I rolled off the bed onto the floor and hid on my knees while my
husband threw on his robe that was beside the bed," recalled the
woman, who said that she and her husband each assumed the other had
locked the door. "He took the mail, said calmly, 'OK you guys, go
outside and play now' and went into the bathroom."</LD>
<TE>   The couple, who asked for anonymity, weren't sure what had
registered with the girls.</TE>
<TE>   "The most embarrassing thing was, I had to call my neighbor and
tell her what had happened, just in case her daughter, who was 7,
said anything," recounted the woman. "I thought, oh my God, what did
they see?"</TE>
<TE>   That was six years ago, and the woman, now 42, said her daughter
never asked questions afterward, and she doesn't know if her
neighbor's daughter ever did. "I never heard, and I wasn't going to
ask," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It happens. Children accidentally intrude upon parents while they
are being physically intimate. Precise numbers are hard to come by,
but in a poll conducted by www.wholefamily.com, 50% of parents who
participated claimed that a child had stumbled in during the sex act,
or at least while they were trying to get into the act. Human
sexuality educators and psychologists advise parents to buy a lock
for their bedroom door and teach their children that a locked or
closed door means they want privacy. But even locks don't always
prevent children interruptus. So parents would do themselves a favor,
the experts said, by thinking in advance about how they want to deal
with a child walking in on them mid-sex.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents should remain calm, not overreact and keep their wits
about them," said Deborah M. Roffman, who has been a human sexuality
educator for 30 years in the Baltimore area and is the author of "But
How'd I Get in There in the First Place? Talking to a Young Child
About Sex" (Perseus, 2002). "How they respond determines how the
child will respond and whether or not the experience will be
traumatizing."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, most parents are shocked and embarrassed when they roll
over, basking in the afterglow of lovemaking, to see that their
3-year-old has been standing there wide-eyed for who knows how long.
Many parents fear that a child witnessing parental lovemaking,
something Freud called "the Primal Scene," will become sexually
aroused or permanently confused. Not so, say psychologists, who add
that a single incident is not harmful or damaging. Indeed, many of
the world's children sleep in the same room with their parents (75%
by one estimate), observing parental lovemaking throughout childhood
without damaging their adult development, writes human sexuality
educator Debra Haffner, author of "From Diapers to Dating: A Parents'
Guide to Raising Sexually Healthy Children," (Newmarket Press, 2000).</TE>
<TE>   Like Roffman, Beverly Palmer, a psychology professor at Cal State
Dominguez Hills, urges parents to stay cool when a child intrudes.
"If your embarrassment is all that the child takes away, then that is
a problem because the child associates what the parents were doing
with something that is not OK," said Palmer, a clinical psychologist
who has a practice in Torrance specializing in sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Parents should first take a deep breath and gently ask the child
to leave the room (yelling "Get outta here," for example, would be a
bad move). Assure the child that one or the other parent will come to
talk to them in a minute. Start by asking the child: "What did you
see? What were you thinking about? Is there something you want to
talk about?" If children are not forthcoming, said Roffman, parents
shouldn't pressure them but assure them that they are available for
questions anytime.</TE>
<TE>   "The child may be very confused, scared or curious and might even
think that someone was hurting someone," said Roffman. "If the child
doesn't know anything at this point, [try] a simple statement like,
'You may have been surprised by what you saw because you didn't know
that adults like mom and dad enjoy each other's bodies by kissing and
touching.' "</TE>
<TE>   Children may ask why their parents were naked. "You can say Mom
and Dad were naked because we enjoy holding each other's bodies and
hugging and kissing because it is warm and cozy," said Roffman.</TE>
<TE>   The younger the child, the less specific and more open-ended the
communication should be, the experts say. What parents say to a
10-year-old, who probably knows more about sexuality than say a
6-year-old, will be different. A 10-year-old probably is less
frightened and confused than a younger child but may experience more
embarrassment and shock, said Roffman. The child still needs to hear
that "sex is a special way couples like Mom and Dad hug and kiss and
touch each other" and that the act gives the parents pleasure and
makes them feel close and loving toward each other, she said. And if
the child thinks this is disgusting and gross even after the
explanation, the parent can provide reassurance that it's hard for
children to understand because sex is an adult activity.</TE>
<TE>   If a child is preschool age? "Trust me, they are not likely to
understand what is going on," Haffner writes. "This is not the time
for the big talk on the joys of intercourse!"</TE>
<TE>   This, apparently, is a common impulse. "Parents often over-explain
because they are assuming what they think the child's interpretation
of events is. But it is much better to respond to what the child's
needs are at this time," Palmer said. "The most important thing is to
shut your mouth and open your ears. The child only needs information
[on topics] about which they have questions."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the child hasn't a clue what is going on, Haffner writes,
parents should not ignore that intrusion because one can't know what
a child saw or heard and whether or not it frightened them. The
negative moment can be embraced to teach a child that parents need
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Rarely do adolescents accidentally burst in on their parents'
lovemaking sessions. But if they do, parents can assume their
teenagers know what is going on. By that age, adolescents have had
sex education classes in school, been exposed to a tidal wave of
sexual information and messages from friends, the media and the
Internet and generally have had the birds-and-bees talk with their
parents. Adolescents will probably run screaming in the other
direction at the thought of their parents "doing it."</TE>
<TE>   "But even an older child can misinterpret something sexual they
see as not pleasurable, but negative," said Palmer. For this reason,
parents should reassure a teenage child that sex is something adults
(or married people, depending on one's values) do to show their love
toward each other. "You say: 'I hope this is something you feel you
can come to me with if you have any questions,' " said Palmer, who
added that parents should always talk about sex without personalizing
it.</TE>
<TE>   As for the couple whose daughter burst in on them with her friend,
they did recover. Once the girls went back outside, the couple locked
their door and went back to what they were doing. Later, the woman
told the girls always to knock when the door is closed. And since
that day, the couple never forgot to double-check the bedroom lock
before stealing an afternoon for themselves.</TE>

<LD>IN LANDS NOT MY OWN</LD>
<LD>   A Wartime Journey</LD>
<LD>   By Reuben Ainsztein</LD>
<TE>   Random House</TE>
<TE>   272 pages; $24.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "In Lands Not My Own" is the story of a man who felt himself to be
a foreigner, even in the land where he was born. Reuben Ainsztein
came into the world in 1917 in the Lithuanian city now called
Vilnius. In the years after World War I, when Ainsztein was growing
up there, the city was part of Poland and called Wilno.</TE>
<TE>   As a Jewish child attending a Polish school, young Reuben at first
had no difficulty harmonizing both traditions: "[T]he history of
Poland appeared to me to have a moral sense, to have been the story
of ... a constant fight against oppression, slavery and injustice.
Yes, it seemed to me that Poland really was my country and the Poles
really were my brothers; that no people in the world could better
understand our misfortunes or sympathize with them more deeply. But
very soon I learned how different reality was."</TE>
<TE>   His young Christian contemporaries thought nothing of attacking
Jews without provocation. Their parents only laughed at their antics.
Nor was such behavior confined to the lower classes: "[A]s I grew up
I saw university students attacking Jewish women and old men with
heavy sticks." The boy sought role models elsewhere. At one point,
Marxism seemed to hold all the answers. But just as the behavior of
Poles gave the lie to the idealistic state mythology they mouthed, a
Marxist whom he met seemed as fervid in her beliefs as any religious
fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   Ainsztein instead took as his role model that sterling figure
straight off the pages of his favorite books: the Englishman. Nor did
it hurt that the Polish-born Joseph Conrad had not only admired the
English above every other group, but had also managed to transform
himself into one of England's greatest modern novelists.</TE>
<TE>   By 1936, Ainsztein, who hoped to become a doctor, had earned his
secondary school diploma. But Polish anti-Semitism was on the rise,
making it impossible for him to attend a university there. Instead,
he went to study in Brussels. Acutely aware of the menace of Hitler,
and still dreaming of following in Conrad's Anglophile footsteps,
Ainsztein decided in 1937 to try to join the British armed forces.
After repeated efforts, he was finally granted permission in February
1940 to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve.</TE>
<TE>   But getting to England, once the Germans were occupying much of
Europe, was another story, and it is this vividly remembered tale of
his adventures that forms the bulk of this riveting memoir.
Ainsztein's desperate efforts to flee Europe for England took him
into a dangerously defeatist France and, from there, across the
Pyrenees alone and on foot into Spain, where he was interned for over
a year in a prison camp.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, he finally made his way to England, where he
became a gunner on the crew of an RAF bomber.</TE>
<TE>   The final third of the book, dealing with his experiences in the
RA, is as compelling as the story that leads up to it.</TE>
<TE>   Moments of high drama--such as his journey across the
Pyrenees--are rendered with clarity and immediacy: "My solitary
figure coming down the mountain pass might have aroused ...
suspicions, so I had to keep to wooded parts of the mountain, force
my way among snow-laden saplings, wade through drifts, slide down
uncovered soil, and travel quickly. The sun was setting, and I was
still nowhere near the border. I soon learned that geography was not
on my side. As the ranges were running from east to west and I was
making south, I was doomed to climb and descend, and climb and
descend again.... "</TE>
<TE>   Fascinating in a different way are his accounts of the people and
countries he encounters, and his reflections on their various
national characters: Despite a history that includes the Inquisition
and the expulsion of Jews, the Spaniards he meets do not strike him
as exceptionally anti-Semitic.</TE>
<TE>   His fellow Poles, however, seem to shrug off Hitler's racism (even
when it is applied against them as being "inferior" Slavs) and
applaud when told about Hitler's murder of the Jews.</TE>
<TE>   When at last he boards a British destroyer for Gibraltar, he is
"struck by the absence of all shouting or barking of orders and by
the grinning faces of the men. To be among naval or military people
who issued commands in conversational tones was an uncanny experience
to all of us brought up in Poland and acquainted with a German kind
of discipline. We immediately felt that there was something about the
way these people ran their naval affairs that made them different
from all other nations we had known. Their self-assured behavior
impressed even the most stupid and arrogant among my companions."</TE>
<TE>   Ainsztein, who died in 1981, worked as a researcher for the BBC
and Reuters. He also wrote two well-regarded historical studies, "The
Warsaw Ghetto Revolt" and "Jewish Resistance in Nazi-Occupied Eastern
Europe."</TE>
<TE>   The manuscript of this memoir, apparently written sometime in the
1940s or 1950s, was found in an attic by one of his relatives in
2000. It has all the sharpness of experience still fresh in the
author's memory and almost none of the self-consciousness and
guardedness that can come from writing with publication in mind.</TE>
<TE>   One cannot know what audience, if any, Ainsztein envisioned when
he sat down to put his story into words. But the result is a book
that will provide a wide range of readers with a sense of what it was
like to live through those years of danger, despair, struggle and
hope.</TE>

<LD>The Roaring '20s</LD>
<LD>   What if you could travel back in time to the decade of the 1920s?
What do you think your school day would be like? Let's pretend you
are a student in a 1920s school.</LD>
<LD>   Your building is most likely made out of brick. As you enter your
classroom, you smell the oiled wooden floors. All the desks in your
row are connected to one another.</LD>
<TE>   You study familiar subjects such as reading, writing, arithmetic,
spelling, grammar, history and science. But you also study
"elocution" (public speaking) and are required to memorize poems and
recite them in front of the whole class. The textbooks have really
small print and no colored pictures. You do assignments using a pen
with a sharp metal point and dip it in a jar of liquid ink that rests
in a holder on your desk. And your teacher sometimes announces a
surprise fingernail inspection.</TE>
<TE>   During recess, the girls play "double Dutch" by turning two jump
ropes in opposite directions. As one of them jumps, everyone chants
rhymes such as: "Apples, peaches, pears and plums, tell me when your
birthday comes." Sometimes, the jumping is done in double-quick time,
called "peppers."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the boys are on their knees. They have put an equal number
of marbles in the middle of a circle. The marbles have different
names, including: "glassies" (transparent marbles), "agates" (white
marbles with colored swirls), and "donnecks" (big marbles). One of
the boys takes his "shooter" and places it on top of his index finger
and in front of his thumb. Then, with his hand resting on the ground,
he fires the shooter from the edge of the circle and tries to knock
one or more of the marbles out of the ring. The dislodged marbles are
his to keep.</TE>
<TE>   On the playground, some students wear "cheaters" (glasses) and
ride to school in a "jalopy" (beat-up old car). Boys are called
"fellers" and small kids are called "half-pints." A teacher tells you
to stop "lollygagging" (being lazy). The school bully is "razzing"
(teasing) another student. Some of the kids are talking about the
"keen" (great) movie they saw for a "buffalo" (nickel). In general,
children are supposed to be nice to the "little shavers" (smaller
kids), and should avoid giving their parents any "guff" (back talk).</TE>
<TE>   You can experience the Roaring '20s for yourself by bringing your
parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends to the Homestead

<HD>In One Color, He Sees Many Shades</HD>
<DH>'Brown' author Richard Rodriguez finds a symbol for
America's blend of cultures</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL J. YBARRA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Pacific Heights is about as white a residential area as you can find
anywhere. Perched above the glorious San Francisco Bay, the
neighborhood is a place from which you can only look down. If you see
a brown face, chances are it belongs to someone trimming a hedge or
painting a Victorian home--or to Richard Rodriguez, the writer and
social critic, whose caramel skin and Indian features bespeak his
Mexican American origins but whose jazz-like prose, propulsive and
discursive, defies such easy characterization.</LD>
<LD>   Yet if Rodriguez is something of an anomaly in this rather pale
environment, it's unlikely that he would blend in exactly anywhere.
Being different seems to be the pigment of his consciousness.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm powerfully Catholic and at war with the church at the same
time," he says, sitting in his book-crammed Pacific Heights
apartment, across the street from a hilly park. "I'm Catholic and I'm
equally homosexual. One part of me is sex. One part of me is sin. It
shapes my heart, my soul, my mouth, everything. It's impurity. I'm
brown."</LD>
<TE>   "Brown" is also the name of Rodriguez's latest book, the
conclusion of an inadvertent trilogy (all from Viking) that started
with the celebrated "Hunger of Memory" and continued with "Days of
Obligation."</TE>
<TE>   The first book dealt with class, specifically the writer's unease
with his own rise in the world via affirmative action scholarships.
The second traced the influence of ethnicity on his life. The third
addresses race, what race means to Rodriguez and what race means to
America. All the volumes walk a tightrope between the personal and
the public, between the potentialities of assimilation and the
pitfalls of alienation. "There's an anger in all of my books," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   To Rodriguez, brown is not necessarily Latino; it's any admixture
of hues available in a multicultural society. Rodriguez mentions a
letter he received from a woman whose grandparents were Korean and
African American. She called herself a Baptist Buddhist. Brown is
adulteration, whether by accident or design. Think Tiger Woods--or
even Madonna, who continually reinvents herself with a fluidity that
could be called brown.</TE>
<TE>   "We're facing an extraordinarily brown moment in America,"
Rodriguez says. "I've come as a prophet of brown to tell you that
your grandchildren will be brown."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, Rodriguez likes to say, is what happens when you mix all
the other colors on the palate. "Clean your paintbrush and you get
brown," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I write of a color that is not a singular color," his book
begins, "not a strict recipe, not an expected result, but a color
produced by careless desire, even by accident; by two or several. I
write of blood that is blended. I write of brown as complete freedom
of substance and narrative. I extol impurity."</TE>
<TE>   Like its predecessors, "Brown" has been greeted with acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most eloquent and probing public intellectuals in the
country," wrote Marie Arana in the Washington Post. " ... There are
few writers in America as unpredictable and fearless as this."</TE>
<TE>   "This was a Horatio Alger story," noted Anthony Walton in the New
York Times, "but unlike any that had previously been written; both
the starting point and the place of arrival were rigorously analyzed
and nothing put under more scathing scrutiny than the writer
himself--his own ambitions, embarrassments, dreams and shame."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's expressive struggle with his own identity has clearly
touched the zeitgeist. Recently, for example, the Quad Cities along
the Iowa-Illinois border picked "Hunger of Memory" as a community
book to read and Rodriguez appeared at several events. At one high
school, a student rose to say how affected he was by the book.
"Before I read this book," he said, "I was nothing. Now, I am
something."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was born in 1944 in San Francisco, the son of
working-class Mexican immigrant parents (his folks were married at
St. Dominic's, the church Rodriguez attends just down the street from
where he now lives). He grew up in Sacramento, learning English at
Catholic school from Irish nuns. His father had two years of formal
education and Rodriguez soon found himself straddling two very
different worlds.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is like going to a foreign country every day," he says.
"It overturns the traditional authority structure because the child
knows more than the parent; it's very upsetting to some children."</TE>
<TE>   He learned to write by reading the works of African American
novelists such as James Baldwin, the descendants of slaves who took
the language of their masters and made it their own.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of forces at work in my life," Rodriguez says.
"My brown is of many hues. I become browner by living. In some ways
I've become Protestant just by breathing the air. I've meditated with
Buddhists, I've studied with a rabbi. I take my wisdom from many
sources."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Nixon, for example, whom Rodriguez refers to as his
godfather, since the former president made "Hispanic" a census term
and launched the affirmative action programs that helped Rodriguez go
to Stanford and Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of Nixon, several million Americans were baptized
Hispanic," Rodriguez writes. "It was Nixon who arranged for me to
bypass the old rules. Through the agency of affirmative action, akin
to those pivotal narrative devices in Victorian fictions, I had
suddenly a powerful father in America, like Old Man Kennedy. I had,
in short, found a way to cheat."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Rodriguez is also a fierce critic of race-based
affirmative action, believing that class is a more just way of
redressing inequality. "The middle class has no right to affirmative
action," he says. "I know the deepest scar in me was class."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez first exposed his scars to the world in "Hunger of
Memory," which was rejected by nine publishers before finally being
published in 1983. "A necessary betrayal" he calls the book because
of the pain it caused his family.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents didn't want it to be published," he adds. "They had a
working-class sense of privacy. They never completely reconciled
themselves to the book. I don't think they read the second."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, his father died at the age of 96. Rodriguez was
impressed by the nobility with which his father approached his
demise. "There was a kind of brilliance," he says. "I've never felt
so light. Joy is the closest feeling I can describe it. He was
releasing me to life by showing me how to die. I want to live
intensively. I want to live heroically."</TE>
<TE>   Although Rodriguez has written some of the seminal texts of ethnic
studies, he has never reconciled himself to having his books stuck in
the Hispanic section of stores, the literary barrio, instead of among
the authors who inspired him. "The price of being a published brown
author is that one cannot be shelved near those one has loved," he
writes. "The price is segregation."</TE>
<TE>   The paradox is that while Rodriguez writes about the differences
that divide contemporary America he is also writing about the
essential qualities that define what it means to be an American in
the 21st century.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't speak English," he says. "We speak American. I think of
myself as an American writer."</TE>

<HD>Intrigue, Lust and Merchandising</HD>
<DH>By tapping into a devoted fan base, networks and others
hope to clean up on product tie-ins to TV soap operas</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ROSENBAUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The parents anxiously await the DNA results on their
switched-at-birth child, a missing woman miraculously stumbles into
her own funeral, and a teenager discovers her mother hid an Internet
Web camera in her boyfriend's apartment.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Soapland. The never-never daytime world where everyone
looks great whether they are comatose, locked up at Statesville
prison or getting married to the evil twin. Yet, even as a character
is in the midst of falsely confessing to murdering a daughter's
lesbian lover, it is hard not to notice that her house, her clothes
and her jewelry all look marvelous.</LD>
<LD>   The dedication soap operas engender in some fans has as much to do
with the fabulous fashions and divine decor as the sometimes
ludicrous plot twists. Fans keep tuning in, day after day, some for
more than 30 years, watching such characters as Erica Kane of ABC's
"All My Children" wind through nine marriages to six different men.
(Her real soap name should actually read Erica Kane Martin Brent
Cudahy Chandler Montgomery Montgomery Chandler Marick Marick. )</LD>
<TE>   Think of all those engagement rings.</TE>
<TE>   The market potential of this zealous fan devotion has not gone
unnoticed. Network television stores are putting aside the
traditional logo coffee mug and T-shirt because the real money, it
turns out, is in allowing viewers to create their own piece of the TV
towns of Salem, Pine Valley, Llanview, Port Charles and Harmony.</TE>
<TE>   ABC debuted its Shop the Soaps feature last summer in "All My
Children's" steamy Pine Valley by having the character Dixie Martin
wear a "wishing star" necklace. The first commercial break directed
viewers to ABC's Web site, informing them they could own their own
wishing star necklace. The necklace, along with three other pieces of
jewelry featured on the show, drew respectable sales on ABC.com and
on the Home Shopping Network, which handles customer service and
merchandising for ABC.</TE>
<TE>   Before Dixie could be saved from a mysterious death under
questionable circumstances, the Shop the Soaps line was vastly
expanded. Now viewers can purchase items showcased on three ABC
soaps, such as a pair of 14-karat gold, faux-diamond drop earrings
for $69.95. If the "One Life to Live" story line is any guide, these
earrings are a must if one happens to find out the baby one was told
had died during childbirth is alive and living in one's home as an
adopted son.</TE>
<TE>   Or perhaps a viewer would be more interested in Simone's
"Shimmering Nights" comforter. The "All My Children" character found
it handy to use as a cover-up when she was caught topless while
fooling around with her best friend's father. Pillows are also
available, but be advised, they do not provide as much coverage.
Items from "General Hospital" round out ABC's offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Like an awkward understudy, the merchandising on ABC is anything
but subtle. Now when the camera comes in for a close-up in a crucial
scene, it's likely not focusing on a telltale facial expression but
on a bracelet, which will be featured in the teaser on the next
commercial break.</TE>
<TE>   On "All My Children," when Leo du Pres decided to propose to his
off-again, on-again love interest Greenlee Smythe, he did so perched
strategically on Greenlee's "Fantasy Nights" comforter bedroom set
($199.95). Momentarily stunned, Greenlee accepted the sterling silver
engagement ring ($62.25) as she sat on her bed buttressed by her
throw pillows ($24.85) and neck pillow ($17.85).</TE>
<TE>   All that will look like simple Economics 101 compared to the
cross-promotion NBC has in store for its daytime fans. Starting in
late July, viewers of NBC's "Days of Our Lives" will be able to
re-create their daytime dreamlands down to the diamonds dangling from
Dr. Marlena Evans Black's ears or the computer in Victor Kiriakis'
office.</TE>
<TE>   In a strategic venture with NBC, ValueVision Media, a multimedia
shopping company, will soon offer soap opera tie-ins on its own cable
shopping channel, ShopNBC. The channel will go a more upscale route
than ABC's offerings.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fans know their soap character wouldn't wear cubic zirconia,"
said Steven Goldsmith, ShopNBC senior vice president and general
merchandising manager. "So we are not going to cheat them on the
things we sell. Soap fans are very devoted to their soaps and to
their characters. We are going to explore that devotion and give them
exactly what they want."</TE>
<TE>   The merchandise will also be available for purchase at ShopNBC.com
and NBC.com. "We are trying to create the 'infotainment' bridge
between entertainment and shopping," said Brandon Burgess, NBC's
executive vice president of businesses development.</TE>
<TE>   If the Winter Olympics are any indication of the potential success
of this "synergy," NBC expects the money will soon flow freer than
the sands through the "Days of Our Lives" hourglass. With a long line
of Salt Lake City shoppers behind him, an NBC commentator this winter
casually mentioned that the popular Olympic berets were available at
ShopNBC.com. Within days, the network had sold 75,000 hats at $25
each.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to soap merchandise, the ShopNBC channel will air a
series called "Soap Style" every other Saturday afternoon, which will
feature behind-the-scenes footage from "Days of Our Lives" and
"Passions," including bloopers, story line previews as well as
interviews with the network's daytime stars.</TE>
<TE>   And its soaps are just the beginning. This fall more than 20 NBC
prime-time shows will have some type of a commerce element that will
refer the audience to ShopNBC. However, not everything seen on
television will be marketed to the masses. Without a stylist,
personal trainer and nutritionist, some fans will just not look like
Jennifer Aniston in a "Friends" dress.</TE>
<TE>   "You would get at least 50% back in returns," said Gene McCaffery,
chairman and chief executive of ValueVision Media.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, CBS has yet to jump on the daytime shopping bandwagon.
Content to stick with its logo items and its "Survivor" Buff, a
versatile swatch of spandex that can, as its marketers say, "double
as a skullcap, armband or tube top."</TE>
<TE>   "Can you turn it into a nice business? I'm not sure," said David
Katz, CBS senior vice president of strategic planning and interactive
ventures.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how well the other soaps are doing or how much they
are making, but there is also a nonfinancial value to doing this--and
certainly we would look at it if it made sense to us--but our goal is
not to become the Home Shopping Network."</TE>

<LD>Riley opened up the last present at his birthday dinner. "It's just a
piece of paper," said Riley's little sister, Wendy.</LD>
<LD>   "Who's it from?" asked Sam, Riley's best friend.</LD>
<LD>   "My Aunt Helen," said Riley. "It says 'gift certificate.' "</LD>
<TE>   "A gift certificate is like a check," said Riley's mother. "You
can take it to Baldwin's Department Store and pick out any gift worth
$30."</TE>
<TE>   "Good," said Sam. "Then maybe you'll get something better than
dumb clothes for your birthday."</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with a gift of clothes?" Riley's father asked in a
pained voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing, Dad," said Riley. "I love what Mom and you got me for my
birthday. They're just like your shirts and pants."</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't you like the rock I gave you?" little Wendy asked. She
began to whimper when Riley didn't answer right away.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, kid," Sam said to her. "I gave your brother a Mighty Robot
Man. That's what guys really like."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, Riley," said his father, "if you don't appreciate your
gifts, maybe you should just give your gift certificate to your
sister. At least she knows how to say 'please' and 'thank you.' "</TE>
<TE>   "But, but, but, Dad!" Riley pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Will Riley have to give away his gift certificate?</TE>

<HD>Treatment in a Pinch</HD>
<DH>Beverly Hills masseuse Utta claims to squish out cellulite,
improve skin tone and reshape her clients' bodies--all with her bare
hands</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In this city of celluloid and image, the search for the perfect body
is endless. And despite the sophistication of the populace, there is
an almost naive faith that enough money can buy a cream, a salt, an
herb, a wrap, a machine, an attitude, a therapy, a miracle that will
strip wrinkles from your face and fat from your thighs, and keep you
forever young.</LD>
<LD>   Among the very pampered of this city--an underground network of
the glamorous and those who serve them--pass beauty secrets unknown
and unaffordable to most of us.</LD>
<LD>   One of those secrets is Utta.</LD>
<TE>   Utta is a Beverly Hills masseuse who claims her deep-tissue
therapy will realign basic body shape, squish away cellulite and
toxins and restore muscle tone. Spend an hour and $150 with Utta, and
you believe that her hands could crush your fat cells and sculpt you
into a Bernini statue with skin smooth and flawless as marble. Each
one of her fingers could compress a Coke can.</TE>
<TE>   Hidden behind a discreet brown door on the second floor of a
modest brick building on Wilshire Boulevard, Utta Body Sculpture is a
place  that inspires superlatives, loyalty and gushing testimonials
from clients. Now, Utta is routinely working 12 hours a day to fit in
clients desperate for a last treatment before she departs for her
traditional two-month summer vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Utta doesn't advertise. Her skills spread by word-of-mouth or
occasional stories about her in beauty magazines such as Elle and
Allure.</TE>
<TE>   She is a one-woman show who works out of two tiny massage rooms
and wears a headset to answer the phone while she plies her trade.
Utta's age is her secret--"Chronological age is irrelevant," she
says. (Best guess: 40-ish.) She doesn't use a last name and is listed
simply as Utta in the phone book.</TE>
<TE>   Signed portraits of grateful celebs adorn her vestibule ("My body
is still in your hands.... Cher"), and she has given last-minute
tone-ups to various stars before they have stripped on screen. Those
who have submitted to her kneading hands include figure skater Tai
Babilonia, Daryl Hannah and Candice Bergen.</TE>
<TE>   She does not claim she can make a Geena Davis into an Audrey
Hepburn, nor a Marilyn Monroe into a Twiggy. A woman's frame is a
woman's frame. But Utta says that women who really know their bodies
will see a difference in their shape and skin tone after a session or
two. Most of her clients' clothes fit differently after seven to 10
sessions, she says.</TE>
<TE>   This is not just any massage. Once the client lies limp on a
heated massage table, Utta attacks the fat, pulling, yanking,
stretching, pinching and kneading until the skin turns pink in
defense. "I go into the areas that are blocked due to little fat
deposits, toxic deposits, injuries, tension, calcium deposits," says
the masseuse from Munich in a soothing, singsong German accent. "I go
in and break down whatever has collected. I reintroduce the
circulation, and the blood comes in and flushes the waste away. It
burns."</TE>
<TE>   On women, those blocked areas (surprise, surprise) tend to hover
between the waistline and the knees, and that irksome pad at the back
of the arm.</TE>
<TE>   First-timers often cry out. Occasionally they bruise.</TE>
<TE>   But Utta says longtime clients get so used to the treatment they
can sleep right through the pinching. Regulars swear the treatments
are addictive. Anne Bennett, 49, of Brentwood, has been going to Utta
twice a week for a year. She does yoga and weights regularly. She
sought out Utta "basically for vanity reasons." Bennett, a mother who
coordinates a conflict resolution program for at-risk teenagers, says
she already ate well and got lots of exercise. But she has had her
clothes taken in since her treatments began. She said her 21-year-old
daughter noticed such a difference she started quizzing her on her
secret. (The daughter is now an Utta addict too.)</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a massage junkie all my life, and this is absolutely
different," Bennett said. "It changes the texture of your skin. She
really does re-sculpt your body. Your skin is not going to look like
a 20-year-old, but you can look really toned and really fit without
doing bizarre things." A whole group of her friends goes now: "We are
Utta groupies."</TE>
<TE>   Helen King (who won't reveal her age but admits to being a
great-grandmother) says she has been a client of Utta's ever since
the masseuse arrived in the United States 25 years ago. King first
sought out Utta after suffering a ruptured disk. She said Utta healed
her, and she has been pain-free ever since and has never had medical
treatment for the injury. "I just have to tell you, this woman is
remarkable," King says. "She just has magic in her hands. Magic in
those fingers. And she is such a good human being besides."</TE>
<TE>   A third client, who declined to be named because she is familiar
to the public, said she read about Utta in a magazine item that she
clipped and held onto for years. Finally, she went, feeling skeptical
but desperate. "I needed to be firmed, toned, because I am in a
position where people are looking at me all the time," she said. "I
went to see her three or four times and, ultimately, when I put on my
jeans or whatever, I went down a size. I couldn't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   There is no question, that once on the table with Utta, you feel
you are in the hands of a gifted masseuse with a calming nature. Her
hands are so strong, her manipulations so unusual, it's easy to
imagine stubborn fat cells being deflated and chunks of cellulite
broken down.</TE>
<TE>   But is this medically possible?</TE>
<TE>   Cellulite, irregularities in the fat layer, shows itself as
dimples in the skin. Cellulite treatment, according to doctors, is
something that has proved highly elusive. Until three years ago there
was no treatment for the dreaded dimple effect that was even
recognized by the FDA. Then in 2000, the FDA approved a
French-created contraption called Endermologie, which is said to,
among other benefits, "temporarily reduce the appearance of
cellulite." The machine is about waist-high, and has an arm with a
suction chamber on it. The chamber lifts the skin, then massages it
aggressively with mechanized rollers. There are various roller
movements, including kneading, popping and a figure eight. Studies
done at Vanderbilt University and UCLA showed that Endermologie
stimulated lymphatic flow, increased blood flow and helped stimulate
the formation of new collagen fiber, which restores elasticity to
skin, according to Dr. Brian Kinney, a clinical assistant professor
of plastic surgery at USC and a spokesman for the American Society
for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. After 12 to 14 sessions, twice a week
for seven to eight weeks, the machine can sometimes make a
difference, Kinney said.</TE>
<TE>   "It can rupture adipocytes [fat cells] like bubble wrap," Kinney
said. "Whether a hand can do it, I don't know. It is conceivable,
although it has never been shown in any peer-reviewed medical journal
that a masseuse might be able to do this."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Peter Vash, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at
UCLA and a secretary of the American Obesity Assn., was more
skeptical. "I am not aware of any scientific peer-reviewed articles
which attest to the fact that either massage or some machines are
able to significantly break down fat cells to the extent that they
can significantly reshape skin or body tone," Vash said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can affect skin/body tones with a whole host of temporary
measures--wraps and creams and certain kinds of salts. Maybe even
massage, to some degree. But from a physiological point of view, all
that does is reduce the amount of fluid, dry out the fluid content of
the skin, so that like a sponge, it drops down and you have a
short-term appearance of flatter, smoother skin."</TE>
<TE>   Utta believes her process works, and that a machine can never
rival the human touch. Sometimes she even pinches herself, while she
is watching a movie or reading a book. She lifts her shirt to show
her belly. Three big babies, no stretch marks.</TE>
<TE>   "Endermologie, that ironing thing, is supposed to work this way,"
she says. "It's metal, and it runs over you to break the cellulite.
But you can never replace hands. Hands are such great tools. They
feel into the body. You have energy coming through your hands."</TE>
<TE>   Utta first found the power in her hands as a swimmer in Germany.
When her teammates would get cramps she would rub them down.
Teammates began to seek her out for headaches and other ailments.
Eventually Utta studied sports massage.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA will never approve Utta, and no peer-reviewed medical
journal will assess her skills.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying it doesn't work," Vash said. "If people believe
this helps and they go, and this treatment is a placebo, and it gives
them inspiration to go out and get healthy, I find no fault with
that."</TE>

<HD>High Hopes for a Tall Child? Check the Growth Charts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you want to know how big a puppy's going to get, popular wisdom
tells you to check out the size of its feet. But how do you tell how
tall your kids will be? Do their pixie toes or clodhopping stompers
offer a tip?</LD>
<LD>   "Parents in my practice are always telling me that," says Dr. Mika
Hiramatsu, a pediatrician in Castro Valley, Calif. "But I don't know
of any specific literature on it."</LD>
<LD>   Science has taken a stab at the height-prediction issue, though.
(How could it be otherwise, given how preoccupied we humans can be
with stature, with being tall enough/short enough/just-right enough
to get the boy, get the girl, get along in life?) The result is
various calculators and formulas--even atlases of the slow, steady
changes in kids' bones as they grow. But there's a lot of slop in
such predictions, as much as several inches in either direction.</LD>
<TE>   "I tell parents ... we can do it for fun, but don't place any bets
on it," says West Hills pediatrician Christopher Tolcher.</TE>
<TE>   Here, in any case, are a few ways that doctors do their
guesstimating. Simple methods are based on the fact that genes play a
big part in height. If Mom is tall and Dad is tall, then Junior (all
things being equal) will likely be tall as well.</TE>
<TE>   The methods also take into account that men, on average, are
taller than women.</TE>
<TE>   So if you want to know how tall your Sally will be at 18
(excluding any Mohawk hair spikes she may be sporting by then),
calculate the average of Dad's height, minus 5 inches, and Mom's
height.</TE>
<TE>   And your Sammy? Take the average of Mom's height, plus  5 inches,
and Dad's height.</TE>
<TE>   (Thus my kid--the daughter of a 5-foot-7 mom and 6-foot-2
dad--should be 5-feet-8 as an adult.)</TE>
<TE>   For another version of this method, go to www.cdc.gov/growthcharts
and you'll find height charts for U.S. kids up to 20, an age when
growth has generally stopped. From those charts, you can figure out
each parent's height "percentile" (a measure comparing his or her
height to that of others). Take the average of those two percentiles
to figure out your own kid's likely percentile, and thus ... finally
... read off what his or her height may be.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we're not the exact same height as all our same-sex
sibs. (I've got 3 inches on my older sis, for instance.) So this
method only takes you so far.</TE>
<TE>   Another method draws from lots of diligent labor in the first part
of the 20th century: X-ray after X-ray of hundreds of children's
wrist bones done at different stages of their young lives, enclosed
in a hefty tome called the Greulich-Pyle "Radiographic Atlas of
Skeletal Development of the Hand and Wrist."</TE>
<TE>   (These are not the kinds of experiments one could do today, given
the modern appreciation of the risks of repeated X-raying.)</TE>
<TE>   The idea is that those little bones in the wrist slowly change as
kids get older. Over time, they slowly "ossify"--turn from cartilage,
basically, into proper hard bone visible on an X-ray film.</TE>
<TE>   If a kid has suspected growth delays, an X-ray is taken and then
the trusty Greulich-Pyle atlas is dragged down from some shelf, says
Dr. Edward Reiter, pediatric endocrinologist at the Baystate Medical
Center Children's Hospital in Springfield, Mass. That gives a sense
of whether the child's "bone age" matches his or her age. That, in
turn, allows one to calculate the years of bone growth a child has
left--and thus how tall he or she's likely to end up.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't totally iron-clad either, Reiter says. Different
radiologists read the same X-rays differently. In fact, the same
radiologist can read the same X-ray differently, as Reiter discovered
years ago when he sent the same one for reading multiple times and
got different answers.</TE>
<TE>   Other growth tidbits:</TE>
<TE>   * A plethora of chemicals--notably growth hormone--govern the rate
at which we grow.</TE>
<TE>   * Growth hormone gushes out in pulses, many times a day. The size
of those pulses governs how fast we grow: Pulses are huge at puberty
and wee dribbles in later years.</TE>
<TE>   * We seem to grow in pulses too--in little spurts separated by
periods of no growth.</TE>
<TE>   * Growing pains--usually in the legs--are real, doctors say, but
it's not known what causes them.</TE>
<TE>   * Chronic sicknesses and malnutrition affect ultimate height,
explaining why people in former centuries were shorter than they are
today. (People in the U.S. are probably maxed out, height-wise.)</TE>
<TE>   Puberty signifies the inevitable end of growth.</TE>

<HD>Analysis Questions Link Between Breast Milk, IQ</HD>
<DH>Research* Survey says many studies that touted breast-fed
babies' greater intelligence were flawed. Experts still support the
practice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Breast-feeding has been linked--often effusively--to more smarts. In
fact, a stack of medical studies in recent years has led many parents
to believe that breast-feeding is a must if they want their children
to do well in school.</LD>
<LD>   Such conclusions may have been a bit hasty. The latest study on
the effects of breast-feeding suggests that many of the earlier
studies don't make the grade when it comes to good scientific
research.</LD>
<LD>   A paper in the June issue of Pediatrics analyzed 40 studies on the
link between breast-feeding and cognitive development, 68% of which
concluded that breast-feeding promotes intelligence. The studies
showed, among other things, that breast-fed babies score higher on
cognitive tests, get better grades in school and have higher IQs as
adults than babies who were bottle-fed. Some found that intelligence
increases for each additional month that a baby is breast-fed.</LD>
<TE>   But researchers from Yale University and the University of Chicago
say their analysis shows that most of the studies had serious flaws.
Only two, in fact, met all the authors' criteria for quality
research; one of those found a "significant" effect of breast-feeding
on intelligence; the other found no correlation.</TE>
<TE>   "The studies have not been very good--and there have been a lot of
them," says Dr. Anjali Jain, who co-wrote the analysis. One major
problem with the studies, she says, is they often didn't take into
account the importance of factors besides breast milk. Some of those
factors may be responsible for the intelligence gains.
"Breast-feeding itself takes a fair amount of motivation," she says.
"Just being a motivated parent is important. But a bottle-fed child
could also be [cognitively] stimulated by a motivated mother."</TE>
<TE>   Another flaw with much of the research was that it failed to
accurately measure how much breast-feeding took place, such as by
recording the amount of time spent breast-feeding or whether the baby
also received formula, Jain says.</TE>
<TE>   However, other experts say the evidence for a connection between
breast-feeding and intelligence is still persuasive.</TE>
<TE>   Good breast-feeding studies are difficult to do because
researchers "can't tell one mother to breast-feed and another she
cannot" for purposes of their study, says Dr. Ruth Lawrence, a
breast-feeding expert at the University of Rochester School of
Medicine. But that doesn't mean health experts should disregard a
preponderance of evidence showing a link, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of data on breast-feeding and intelligence,"
Lawrence notes. The new analysis could be flawed, too, suggests Kim
Cavaliero, a spokeswoman for La Leche League International, a
Schaumburg, Ill., organization that promotes breast-feeding and
supports the claims of enhanced intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "The [researchers] of the study in Pediatrics are interpreting
data," says Cavaliero. "Who is really to say that their
interpretation is correct?"</TE>
<TE>   Until there is more convincing data, however, Jain, an associate
at the University of Chicago, argues that breast-feeding shouldn't be
promoted via the intelligence hook.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a back-to-breast-feeding movement, which I'm very much
in favor of. But I think we feel the need, as a society, to ... try
to link it to something" instead of trusting our intuition that
breast-feeding is generally a good thing, says Jain, herself a
breast-feeding mom.</TE>
<TE>   Research on breast-feeding suggests it can not only spur cognitive
development but can also help protect children from some infectious
diseases and reduce the risks of disorders such as diabetes and
obesity later in life. By breast-feeding, women may lower their
premenopausal risk of breast and ovarian cancer, according to the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   But the touting of specific benefits can lead to enormous guilt in
women who can't breast-feed, leading them to fear that their children
will not be as smart as they could have been or that they will have
more ear infections than their breast-fed playmates.</TE>
<TE>   The breast-feeding and intelligence link "has been used often to
make women who have a lot of trouble breast-feeding feel horrible,"
says Jain. "For working women, it's incredibly hard to maintain
breast-feeding."</TE>
<TE>   About 64% of American women breast-feed their infants to some
extent. However, by the baby's sixth month, only 29% of mothers are
breast-feeding, according to federal government figures. Lawrence
agrees that people should consider breast-feeding based on its
overall benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people get hung up on the idea that breast-feeding makes
a child smart," says Lawrence, a member of the American Academy of
Pediatrics' Task Force on Breastfeeding. "It doesn't make a child
smart. It facilitates the brain's development so children can reach
their full potential."</TE>
<TE>   But, Lawrence says, there is legitimate interest surrounding
research on breast-feeding and brain development.</TE>
<TE>   "The brain is going to double in size during the first year of
life," she says. "Why not give it the best nourishment possible?"</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You're really not sure why you're gaining weight, are inexplicably
tired in the morning, and the kitchen, which was clean when you went
to bed, is now a mess. If this sounds familiar, you may have a
sleep-eating disorder that is more serious than the midnight
munchies.</LD>
<LD>   It is estimated that about 4 million Americans, mostly women, have
a condition known as nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder, or
NSRED, in which they consume large amounts of food during the night
when they may be only half-awake. If they do remember, they may be
too ashamed to admit it, says Lea Montgomery, a clinical instructor
at the Harris School of Nursing at Texas Christian University in Fort
Worth. Pasta and sweets are favorites, but on rare occasions people
have been known to snack on cat food, cigarettes or cleaning products
during their nighttime kitchen excursions.</LD>
<LD>   Other sleep problems such as sleep apnea and restless-leg syndrome
may prompt a bingeing episode. The condition also has been linked to
low melatonin levels and high levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
In an article alerting nurses to the unusual sleep disorder,
Montgomery points out that identifying the problem is critical so
treatment can begin, and the person can take steps to avoid
accidental poisoning, burning or cutting herself while preparing food
in a sleepy state. (RN 2002: 65 (4):41-43.)</LD>
<TE>   Controversial Herb Promoted Weight Loss in Healthy Adults</TE>
<TE>   The herbal product ephedra has been in the news the past year
because it was an ingredient in dietary supplements linked to the
deaths of some college and professional athletes. There is scientific
evidence that ephedra may contribute to heart attacks and strokes.
Now some surprising news: Ephedra safely promoted weight loss in a
large group of healthy men and women participating in a six-month
study.</TE>
<TE>   Lead author Carol N. Boozer, director of the Energy Metabolism
Core Laboratory at the New York Obesity Research Center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital and Columbia University, says she and her
colleagues were asked by a consortium of supplement manufacturers to
do a rigorous trial testing the safety and effectiveness of the
common diet combo of ma huang (ephedrine alkaloids) and kola nut
(caffeine). The researchers agreed to undertake the study on the
condition that the results would be published even if they found the
supplements were unsafe or didn't work.</TE>
<TE>   After thorough checkups, involving 24-hour blood pressure and
heart rate monitoring and electrocardiograms, the 167 volunteers were
divided into two groups: One took two tablets of the supplement three
times a day, which Boozer says is the upper limit of the usually
recommended dose; the other group took a placebo.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of six months, the average weight loss of those taking
the supplements was 15.4 pounds; those taking the placebo lost 6.8
pounds. Side effects ranged from heart palpitations and irregular
heartbeat to insomnia and dry mouth, causing 80 people to drop out.
However, the side effects occurred with nearly equal frequency in
both groups. For instance, of the five people who dropped out because
their blood pressure went up, three were taking the placebo.</TE>
<TE>   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Richard L. Atkinson,
editor of the International Journal of Obesity, advised consumers to
use ephedra-caffeine supplements with "great caution" and only with
guidance from a physician. (International Journal of Obesity [2002]
26, 593-604.)</TE>
<TE>   Metamizole 'Aspirin' Banned but Still Found in Ethnic Markets</TE>
<TE>   Pain relievers containing metamizole have been banned in the U.S.
for years, but researchers at the University of Utah say such
products, sometimes known as Mexican aspirin, are being sold at
markets that cater to Latino immigrants. Doctors are concerned
because metamizole, or dipyrone, can cause a severe drop in white
blood cells with potentially fatal consequences.</TE>
<TE>   "The side effect is rare, but there is no way to predict who is
susceptible," says Dr. Carrie L. Byington, a pediatrician at the
University of Utah School of Medicine. Physicians who aren't aware of
the cause of a patient's fever and low white blood cell count may
misdiagnose the condition, which resembles leukemia.</TE>
<TE>   Byington became aware of the problem when treating a 4-year-old
with these signs. The child's mother reported giving him metamizole.
The mother, too, had been seriously ill and hospitalized five months
earlier after she had taken the drug, which is often sold under the
brand name Neo-melubrina. Neither she, nor her doctors, had linked
the drug to her illness.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, Byington and her colleagues surveyed Spanish- and
Portuguese-speaking parents of children treated in a clinic and
learned that 35% had used metamizole. Byington said many of the
people had purchased the drug in the U.S and given it to their
children.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're seeing this in Salt Lake City, I'm sure it's available
everywhere," Byington said. She cites another survey done last year
that found widespread use of Neo-melubrina in two San Diego clinics.
These surveys may be underestimating the prevalence of the drug
because researchers questioned mainly Latino patients. Byington
reports that there are more than 240 metamizole preparations
manufactured in 18 countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Physicians treating children with fevers need to find out if
they've been treated with dipyrone, and if they have, we need to get
the family to stop using that agent," said Dr. Brian Johnston of
White Memorial Medical Center in East Los Angeles. (Pediatrics 109
(6): E98.)</TE>
<TE>   Exercises Soon After Delivery May Help Moms Avoid Incontinence</TE>
<TE>   New mothers may not talk about incontinence among their friends,
but it is estimated that as many as one in three have trouble with
bladder control. For many it becomes a chronic problem. When pelvic
floor exercises are started soon after delivery, a recent Australian
study shows, it may be possible to avoid this troubling complication.
Previous research suggests the exercises are helpful in treating
urinary incontinence, but this is the first study to show they may be
useful before symptoms occur.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers recruited more than 700 women in three hospitals
who had given birth to large babies within the last 48 hours or who
had medically assisted vaginal deliveries, such as with forceps. One
group received exercise instructions from the therapist, whom they
also visited again eight weeks later. The second group had the usual
care--a brochure describing the exercises and an invitation to attend
a postnatal class. The one-on-one instruction appeared to improve the
women's discipline: 89% of them did the exercises three times a week
or more, compared with 57.6% of those in the second group who
received no personalized instruction. About 38% of those in the
exercise program had symptoms of incontinence, compared with 31% in
the usual care group. (British Medical Journal 2202; 324:1241.)</TE>
<TE>   Viagra Letdown? Doctors Say Read Instructions and Try, Try Again</TE>
<TE>   Viagra failure may say more about whether a man reads directions
or remembers what his doctor told him than his physical ability to
have an erection. Understanding how Viagra works, how to take it and
a willingness to keep trying can make all the difference in a
successful response, according to research presented in May at the
American Urological Assn.'s scientific meeting in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of this study, more than 200 men for whom Viagra
hadn't worked had a medical evaluation and watched a video about
erectile function. They were given printed instructions, including
directions to take the pill one hour before sexual stimulation and on
an empty stomach or after a low-fat meal. Men were also advised to
avoid alcohol, to try the medication several times and to show the
instructions to their partners.</TE>
<TE>   The program direction helped about 40% of the men. Typically, they
needed to try Viagra six to eight times before experiencing the
drug's maximum effect. This may be due, in part, to anxiety among men
who had been sexually inactive for several years "reentering the
sexual arena," says Dr. Geoffrey N. Sklar, a urologist at the
University of Maryland School of Medicine.</TE>

<HD>Prostate Exam Isn't a Matter of Dread but Necessary
Inconvenience</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I cannot refrain from using the word "irresponsible" in describing
the article on prostate cancer screening examinations ("A Reason to
Dread Prostate Tests a Bit Less," May 27). As the article points out,
the examination consists of a blood test plus a digital rectal
examination of the prostate. It describes "one portion" of the
examination as "extremely uncomfortable."</LD>
<LD>   Please allow me to inform all of your readers that the digital
rectal examination portion of a prostate screening examination is
substantially less uncomfortable than even the minor discomfort of
having blood drawn. One reason so many men die of prostate cancer is
that too few men avail themselves of periodic screening examinations.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorists, pollution, bigotry and substance abuse are a matter of
dread. A prostate screening examination is a matter of inconvenience.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Doctor Files essay ("Sometimes, Modesty Is No Virtue at All," May
27) demonstrates the folly of leaving it to physicians to interpret
patient reactions. The behavior of the patients ("Edna" and "John")
has little or nothing to do with modesty; instead it demonstrates
denial and an "ostrich" approach toward illness ("If I don't get it
diagnosed, maybe it won't hurt me").</LD>
<LD>   This same approach is seen in people who won't get tested for,
say, AIDS because they don't want to know--as if this would somehow
save them from the disease.</LD>

<LD>   As to all those before and after shots, there is no way anyone
made that transformation in such a short period adhering to Phillips'

<HD>Medicare Is a System That Stifles Innovation</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trudy Lieberman's excellent article regarding photodynamic therapy
for macular degeneration ("Medicare Warily Eyes Treatment for Macular
Degeneration," May 20) again drives home the point that Medicare is a
"zero sum" program.</LD>
<LD>   It promises virtually unlimited care for any disease to all
Americans by virtue of their attaining a certain age. Yet it only has
so much money to dole out each year, and that money is going to be
divvied up among the various providers. The only way they have been
able to balance their budget is to price-control the providers and
stifle new technology.</LD>
<LD>   This insanity has got to stop before all the hospitals are
bankrupt, medical technology slows to a trickle and young people have
ceased pursuing medicine as a career. The time has come to declare
the program an abject failure and cut our losses. Write a check
yearly for each Medicare recipient to use as he or she wishes without
restriction, cancel the price controls on hospitals and physicians,
and unleash the benefits of a free market in medical care. Then watch
the surge in medical innovation and an increase in the quality and
quantity of people attracted to medicine as a career.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I love to jog. But lately, as I trot along, sometimes my shins feel
like they're splintering and my knees ache. The pain is usually worse
the next day.</LD>
<LD>   I've tried everything. I've bought shoes with high-tech insoles.
I've jogged on grass. I've even attempted a low-impact shuffle that
earns me some weird looks on the jogging trail. Nothing works. My
legs still protest.</LD>
<LD>   One day a disturbing thought struck me: Maybe I'm getting too old
for this. If you're reasonably active and over 40, you've probably
had a similar experience. Like that afternoon you realized that the
younger guys in your weekly pickup basketball game are just too
strong and fast. Or when your racquetball partner stared at you after
a match and asked if he should call the paramedics.</LD>
<TE>   Everybody slows down eventually, but some experts think it may be
harder for men to accept the physical limitations that start creeping
in during our middle years. Women, explains University of
Massachusetts psychologist Susan Krauss Whitbourne, tend to question
their failings and be critical of their bodies throughout adulthood,
starting at a young age. "Because of that, it's easier for women to
adapt to the aging process," says Whitbourne, who has done research
on how the physical changes that occur with age affect
self-perception and identity. "When age-related changes occur to
them, they take it more in stride."</TE>
<TE>   Whitbourne acknowledges that these are general observations about
the sexes. One suspects that, in particular, boomer women who have
become fitness addicts in recent years may feel a degree of despair
when they lose a step or two. Still, for many men the sense of
self-doubt that comes from realizing that you can't keep up with the
young Turks anymore is especially unsettling. "It taps into our fear
of aging. We think of being old as being dependent and less
powerful," says Dr. Gary Small, a gerontologist and director of the
UCLA Center on Aging. Recognizing these physical changes is part of a
larger phenomenon known as "age reminders," says Small--like when you
can't remember the reason you opened the refrigerator or the name of
a high school girlfriend. Like memory lapses, those moments when you
realize that your physical abilities are slipping remind you that
you've entered a new phase in life--the transition from youth to,
well, non-youth.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us begin to downshift sooner than others. A friend who's
20 years older than I, for example, is able to jog every day, pain
free. Likewise, people react in different ways when they realize
their bodies are changing. The most obvious is what Whitbourne calls
"over-accommodation"--scientific jargon for throwing in the towel.
"You see that a lot in professional athletes," says University of
Illinois kinesiologist Wojtek Chodzko-Zajko, who is chairman of the
Active Aging Partnership, a coalition of health organizations and
government agencies that promotes exercise among people over 50.
Robbed of their capacity to perform at the highest levels, elite
jocks often abandon physical activity altogether, turn flabby and
thereby increase their risk for a range of diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are guys who keep on pounding the pavement despite
their throbbing joints. "If you continue to work out like a maniac,"
says Chodzko-Zajko, "you're going to get hurt, get injured, and that
will reduce quality of life."</TE>
<TE>   He knows. A former competitive runner, Chodzko-Zajko developed
tendinitis and chronic soreness in his legs in his late 30s. And even
though he's an expert on the mechanics of muscle, he kept abusing his
own physique until one day he realized his workout was doing more
harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   But your joints and waistline aren't all that's endangered when
your favorite form of exercise or sport turns against you. "The more
importance one attaches to physical functioning, the more likely that
when something goes wrong they're going to feel bereft," says
Whitbourne. In other words, your self-esteem comes crashing down. The
result can be a serious bout of depression, cautions Dr. Frank
Williams, a gerontologist and scientific director of the American
Federation for Aging Research. The blues often surface among people
over 50, he says, as people realize that they can't do what they used
to do, says Williams.</TE>
<TE>   There's got to be a better way. And there is, of course.
Whitbourne says it's critical to do what psychologists call "positive
reframing," that is, focus on your strengths, especially the gifts
you possess today--wisdom, experience--that you lacked as a strapping
lad. Williams suggests channeling your enthusiasm for a sport that's
become too taxing; former pickup basketball devotees might consider
coaching a youth team, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, stay active, though you'll probably need to make
some adjustments. Chodzko-Zajko, 46, still jogs some days, but on
others he works on strength, flexibility and balance by taking
Pilates and tai chi classes. Williams is 85 and an avid cyclist.</TE>
<TE>   Me? I'm just north of 40, and I think they both have the right
idea. I lace up my running shoes a few times a week, but I'm saving
my knees by riding my bike just as often. And believe me, when I fly
down a hill with the wind at my back, I feel just like a kid.</TE>

<LD>Overview: "Blood ... liquid life ... a powerful medicine all of us
can give and receive," goes the introduction to the series based on
the Douglas Starr book "Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and
Commerce." But make no mistake about it, blood is also big business.</LD>
<LD>   How it works: The series begins by examining the myths about blood
and its role in religious ritual. By the 1700s, doctors began to
decipher the way it circulates, but they still didn't understand its
role in illness--as evidenced by the case of the ailing George
Washington, who died shortly after excessive bloodletting. A major
turning point came when doctors learned to transfuse and preserve
blood, which allowed them to save lives on the battlefield. However,
the widespread use of transfused blood also fostered the spread of
viral diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis. The series' final hour
makes the point that although screening has improved, scientists are
still trying to develop artificial human blood. And medicine, for all
its developments, still depends upon blood donations for surgical
patients and victims of trauma.</LD>

<HD>Foes Hope to Put the Lid on Sale of Nicotine-Laced Water</HD>
<DH>Supplement* Bottled product could be on shelves this month.
Opponents questioning its safety haved asked the FDA to intervene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When you can't light up a cigarette--on an airplane or at work--or
you don't want to smoke around the grandchildren, you soon may be
able to reach for a bottle of nicotine-laced water instead.</LD>
<LD>   A Westlake Village-based company hopes to launch its Nico Water
nationally late this month or in early July. Each bottle of odorless
and flavorless water will sell for $1.99 and contain either 2
milligrams or 4 milligrams of nicotine, about what's in a stick of
nicotine gum or a couple of cigarettes.</LD>
<LD>   The product has been criticized by several groups, including the
American Cancer Society, Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and National
Education Assn., which last December filed a petition asking the
federal Food and Drug Administration to ban the sale of the water
until its safety could be assessed through independent testing. These
groups contend that youngsters might seek out nicotine-spiked water
and become addicted to nicotine.</LD>
<TE>   "We are actively reviewing that petition as quickly as possible,"
said Kathleen Kolar, an FDA spokeswoman. She said the agency was
aware of the company's plans to hit pharmacy shelves within weeks.
But it's unclear whether the FDA will take any action. That's because
the Supreme Court ruled two years ago that the FDA has no authority
to regulate the sale, manufacturing and marketing of tobacco
products.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer, Quick Test Five, which sells tests for
pregnancy, AIDS and drug abuse, says Nico Water doesn't need FDA
approval because it's being sold as a dietary supplement, not as a
product to treat a disease or condition. The water simply gives
smokers an alternative to way to satisfy their nicotine cravings, it
contends.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Owens, the company's chief executive, said Nico Water will be
labeled for sale only to those age 18 and older, the same restriction
placed on over-the-counter nicotine gums and nicotine patches,
although he conceded that there's no way to absolutely ensure a store
clerk won't sell to a minor. If kids want a nicotine boost, they'd
get more from a cigarette or a can of energy drink, he said, adding
that nonsmokers might even get a headache from the nicotine.</TE>
<TE>   "Our market is adults, typically 21- to 45-year-olds," said Owens.</TE>
<TE>   Tobacco addiction specialists say the effects of ingested nicotine
usually last a couple of hours, but that there's no scientific
evidence for how well nicotine-laced water might curb cravings or
exactly how long its effects might last. Company spokesman Ed Haisha
said a study is underway to determine whether Nico Water effectively
controls nicotine cravings and whether it could be used as a smoking
cessation product.</TE>
<TE>   Jed Rose, the co-inventor of the nicotine patch and director of
the Nicotine Research Program at Duke University and the VA Medical
Center in Durham, N.C., said that when you swallow nicotine, about a
third of it circulates through the bloodstream. But, he said, "how
much that would reduce smoking behavior or satisfy a craving for a
cigarette is the question."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Rose said the concept is worthy of investigation. He
and a Duke colleague are working on a nicotine-treated straw that
smokers could use with their favorite beverages. They are submitting
the product to the FDA for a formal review.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the Center for Tobacco Research and
Intervention at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, said he
would prefer to see smokers use federally approved nicotine
products--gum, the patch, an inhaler and a nasal spray--to cut back
on, or stop, smoking. "Why not go with something that has evidence
and some proof supporting it? I'm real reluctant to have any patient
of mine use a product that's not been tested for safety and
effectiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Although Nico Water is being marketed as a supplement, not an
over-the-counter drug, Fiore said he was eager to see if the FDA
would take any action to ban its sale. "We had nicotine lollipops
pulled [from store shelves] a couple of weeks ago, and they were
touted in a very similar way without evidence supporting them."
Those, however, contained a nicotine formulation that was not
approved by the FDA. Nico Water contains nicotine polacrilex, the
same ingredient in the FDA-approved gum and patch.</TE>

<HD>A Nutty Reason for Itchy Lips</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>You must remember this: A kiss is still a kiss--but it can send you
to the hospital if you're allergic to nuts.</LD>
<LD>   According to a study in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, an unexpectedly large number of people with nut allergies
became itchy when kissed by someone who had eaten nuts up to six
hours before the embrace.</LD>
<LD>   In one of the cases involving a kiss on the cheek to a 3-year-old
boy, the reaction was severe enough to require a trip to the
emergency room.</LD>
<TE>   Doctors have known for years that being bussed by someone who has
eaten the wrong food can cause a problem in sensitive individuals.</TE>
<TE>   But when Lori Haapanen and Drs. Rosemary Hallett and Suzanne
Teuber analyzed their database of 379 patients with an allergy to
nuts and seeds, they found 20 who said they had had a reaction after
a kiss--a number they found surprisingly high.</TE>
<TE>   And because the researchers never asked about kissing in their
questionnaire--in each case, the patients themselves raised the issue
as a source of an allergic reaction--the actual number of patients
for whom a kiss can lead to some unpleasant symptoms is probably much
higher.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that 5.3% of our subjects volunteered this type of
personal information suggests that a higher percentage of patients
with severe food allergies are at risk," they said.</TE>
<TE>   In most of the 17 cases they investigated closely, the allergic
reaction usually arose within a minute and was mild, usually
characterized by itching and swelling in the area kissed. However,
four patients developed wheezing.</TE>
<TE>   Seven of the 17 said they had experienced allergic reactions to a
nut-laden kiss more than once. Fourteen had been kissed on the lips.
The 3-year-old boy was merely pecked on the cheek by his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "Four people had reactions even after their partner had brushed
his or her teeth," the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   Because a third of subjects had reactions while dating, teenagers
and young adults in particular need to be informed about exposure to
allergens, and patients of dating age who have severe food allergies
may need extra encouragement to tell friends about it, the authors
said.</TE>

<HD>Using Target Heart Rate Can Help You Maximize Workout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE OAKES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: You sometimes refer to "target heart-rate range." What is
it, and how would I calculate it? I am 57 years old, if that is
relevant.</LD>
<LD>   JoAnna</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Here's the simple formula you can use to see if your
exercise sessions will allow you to reach your aerobic fitness goals
without pushing yourself too hard.</LD>
<TE>   Subtract your age in years from 220. This gives you the maximum
heartbeats per minute that doctors would typically expect for someone
your age.</TE>
<TE>   Multiply by 0.65 and 0.80 to find the minimum and maximum
heartbeats per minute when in your ideal exercise intensity zone.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a 40-year-old would go through these steps: 220 -- 40
= 180; 180 x 0.65 = 117 beats per minute (low end) and 180 x 0.80 =
144 (high end). So that person would want to keep his or her heart
rate above 117 and below 144 during aerobic exercise.</TE>
<TE>   You should take your heart rate as soon as possible after you stop
exercising. Simply take your pulse--either on your wrist or on the
carotid artery, which runs alongside your Adam's apple--by pressing
lightly with a forefinger. Count beats for 10 seconds and multiply by
6 to determine your beats per minute.</TE>
<TE>   Be aware that your heart rate starts to slow down immediately, so
any delay in finding the pulse will distort the count. Practice
first.</TE>
<TE>   If this process still seems like too much trouble, or if you're
pregnant and need to keep track of your heart rate throughout your
workouts, then you might want to use a heart rate monitor--either by
using a gym's exercise equipment (which often has them) or by
purchasing an individual one.</TE>
<TE>   Your target heart rate, of course, depends on your aerobic
fitness, so you should consider the perceived exertion (how hard the
exercise feels to you) when you exercise aerobically.</TE>

<HD>Vision Troubles in Kids Often Go Undetected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most people accept the fact that their eyesight will eventually
worsen. But vision problems are common among young children too, with
about 5% to 10% of all preschool children having some sort of visual
impairment. And because too few children are screened, many problems
go undetected--and uncorrected.</LD>
<LD>   Among the most common correctable visual problems in children are
amblyopia (partial loss of vision in one eye) and strabismus
(misalignment of the eyes). Early treatment is important--not just to
restore normal vision, but to prevent permanent vision loss.</LD>
<LD>   Regular vision testing in children is widely advised by
pediatricians and ophthalmologists alike. The American Academy of
Pediatrics recommends that all infants' eyes be regularly examined
for evidence of eye disease such as misalignment and cataracts. The
exams can be performed as a part of routine check-ups; the first
examination, however, should be performed before six months of age.
Formal vision testing should begin at 3 years of age when visual
acuity can be evaluated more easily.</LD>
<TE>   Often, screening tests are skipped simply because parents (and,
sometimes, physicians) believe their children are too young. After
all, how do you test an infant or young child who can't talk--or even
sit still?</TE>
<TE>   Child vision specialists have come up with some answers. For
example, the classic vision test--the Snellen test--has been modified
in several ways.</TE>
<TE>   The "tumbling E" version, for example, uses only the letter E (the
child must only identify the direction in which the "arms" of the E
are pointing); the Allen card uses schematic figures that a young
child would recognize, such as a truck, a house, a birthday cake, a
horse and a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, even these simplified tests cannot be used
effectively until a child is at least 3 years old, and many children
develop visual problems well before this age. For these children, an
innovative new tool called photoscreening can help. Photoscreening
uses a camera or video system to examine the inner eye, allowing
problems such as strabismus or a refractive error to be detected with
very little cooperation required of the child.</TE>
<TE>   (While this technique is easier to use than typical vision acuity
tests in younger children, doctors don't consider it superior to
traditional vision tests for older children.)</TE>
<TE>   Despite the availability of these screenings, surveys show that
only about half of all 3-year-olds are currently being tested for
visual problems. That figure could undoubtedly be improved if parents
would discuss vision testing with their child's doctor, and, if
necessary, request the tests.</TE>
<TE>   Parents should also be on the lookout for telltale signs and
symptoms of visual problems. Do the child's eyes appear straight? Or
does one eye seem to gaze straight ahead while the other eye turns
inward, upward, downward or outward? Does the child complain that it
is difficult to see or that he or she has double vision? Certain
behaviors could indicate a visual problem. For example, children may
squint, tilt their head, or shut or cover one eye to try to bring
things into focus. Any concerns that arise about a child's vision
should be brought immediately to the attention of a physician.
Although poor eyesight may be an inevitable and irreversible part of
growing old, it is frequently a highly treatable and potentially
reversible condition in children.</TE>

<LD>Although babies can see from the moment they are born, they can do
little more than distinguish light from dark and make out shapes.
Over time, their vision develops, and by about 6 months they're able
to identify and distinguish between objects. (It isn't until at least
7 years old, however, that vision reaches what is considered to be
normal vision.)</LD>
<LD>   Normal visual development requires that the brain receive equally
clear, focused images from both eyes simultaneously. When images from
one eye are out of focus, the brain responds by ignoring, or "turning
off," that eye. A cataract that clouds the lens in one eye, for
example, can cause the brain to do this; a significant refractive
error (the sight in one eye is better than in the other eye) can as
well. The same thing occurs if the eyes send two mismatched images to
the brain, even if both images are clearly focused--such as when the
eyes are misaligned.</LD>
<LD>   Although this strategy is effective in producing a clear, focused
image, the eye that is ignored grows weak with disuse and can go on
to develop permanent loss of vision.</LD>
<TE>   To prevent that from occurring, the underlying cause of the
problem must be treated. For example, glasses may be required to
correct a refractive error; an eye patch can strengthen a weakened
eye (by covering the strong eye, the brain is forced to pay attention
to the weak one); and surgery can remove a cataract or correct
misalignment.</TE>

<HD>Compared to Aspirin, Plavix Not Worth Cost</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A blood thinner that works slightly better than cheap aspirin at
preventing repeat heart attacks or strokes is not worth the extra
cost when used long term, a study concludes.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers looked at aspirin at 4 cents per pill, the drug Plavix
at $3.22 a pill and a combination of the two to figure out their
cost-effectiveness in treating heart disease.</LD>
<LD>   Using aspirin alone was cost-effective, but using Plavix alone or
with aspirin was not, they reported in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Cardiologist Dr. Eric Topol, however, said it is premature to make
such an assessment because long-term use of Plavix has not been
tested in patients and the medicine is not prescribed that way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only recommended at the current time for nine months of
therapy, whereas this analysis is assuming a lifelong therapy," said
Topol, who is from the Cleveland Clinic and took part in one Plavix
study.</TE>
<TE>   Like aspirin, Plavix, also known as clopidogrel, keeps blood
platelets from sticking together and forming clots. It has been shown
to work somewhat better than aspirin, which cuts the risk of heart
attack, stroke or death by 30% in people with heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   Topol said Plavix is generally used for 30 days after an
angioplasty, and guidelines issued in March recommend it for 90 days
after chest pain or a mild heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   For the analysis, Dr. Lee Goldman and his colleagues used a
computer model of the U.S. population over 35 with heart disease.
They predicted how many people would have heart attacks, strokes, or
die over the next 25 years and what it would cost to treat them. They
factored in operations, hospital stays and the added cost of living
longer because of the drugs' benefits. They calculated how much it
would cost for each year of life gained. Aspirin used alone was
considered cost-effective at $11,000 per year of life gained. Plavix
used alone or combined with aspirin was deemed "financially
unattractive" at $130,000 per year gained. The researchers said the
cost of Plavix would have to drop to 60 cents to $1 to bring the cost
per year gained down to $50,000, the level they used as a benchmark.</TE>
<TE>   "You or I might well say that we think our own lives are worth
more than that," said Goldman, of UC San Francisco. "The question is:
Would we pay for it out of our own funds or would we want to pay for
someone else out of our own funds? That's where the debates take
place."</TE>

<HD>'Safer' Cigarettes Appeal to Some, but Appall Others</HD>
<DH>Consumer* New products are marketed as having fewer
carcinogens. But critics fear they will encourage smoking, and
experts call for research.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a smoker can't or won't kick the habit, is puffing on a less
hazardous cigarette the next best alternative? Consumers may have to
decide for themselves.</LD>
<LD>   One product advertised as "the first reduced carcinogen cigarette"
is already on the market; another brand, which its makers say
contains "less toxins," is being test-marketed. And this summer a
nicotine-free, reduced-carcinogen product aimed at smokers who are
trying to quit will arrive on store shelves.</LD>
<LD>   But the very notion of a safer cigarette appalls many
tobacco-control advocates. Saying there is no evidence that smoking
can be made safer, they charge that such products could cause people
to avoid quitting or even to take up smoking.</LD>
<TE>   Other experts have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. They maintain
that independent research should be done on the new cigarettes to
determine if they actually could reduce harm to smokers or work as a
bridge to help the most addicted smokers quit. The new cigarettes
contain fewer nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or
PAHs, carcinogens found in cigarette smoke, than premium cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the majority of [health professionals] would advise
smokers to use these products just yet," says Dr. David Burns, a
tobacco researcher at UC San Diego. "But I think there are people who
are interested in seeing research on whether they work."</TE>
<TE>   Although Vector Tobacco, the maker of the already available Omni,
concedes that sales are slow thus far, the potential market for the
products is vast. Nearly 50 million Americans smoke; many of them
would like to quit and are desperate for a way to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who could quit smoking without a great deal of
difficulty have probably already done so," says John Banzhof,
executive director of Action on Smoking and Health, a Washington,
D.C., anti-tobacco health organization. "Most of us in the [tobacco
control] movement today believe most of the smokers are hard-core
addicts. They find it incredibly hard to quit."</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a less harmful smoke appears to make sense to people.
In a recent poll of smokers and nonsmokers in Indianapolis, 74% said
they think tobacco companies should work toward the development of a
safer cigarette. The poll was commissioned by Brown &amp; Williamson,
which is test-marketing Advance Lights in Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Advance Lights are made with a special tobacco-curing process and
a filter that reduce nitrosamines and PAHs. Omni also uses tobacco
processed to reduce nitrosamines and PAHs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to say that everyone should stop smoking, and we are
pushing toward that," says Bennett LeBow, chief executive of Vector,
which also owns Liggett Group, maker of discount cigarettes. "In the
meantime we really believe you can do something to reduce the
long-term risks of cigarette smoking." But with as many as 4,000
chemicals in cigarette smoke, the risks to smokers are many and
varied. Besides elevating the risk of at least nine forms of cancer,
smoking is linked to heart disease, emphysema and pulmonary
disorders. Smoking also increases the risk of birth defects.</TE>
<TE>   There is no proof that reducing PAHs or nitrosamines translates to
a decreased risk to smokers. And the advertising surrounding Omni and
Advance Lights may mislead people into thinking there is a safe way
to smoke, says Ken Warner, director of the University of Michigan
Tobacco Research Network, which studies smoking and health.</TE>
<TE>   "Smokers who are always trying to avoid quitting may believe that
they are now eliminating their risk of lung cancer," he says. "Former
smokers may say, 'Thank God, they have created a smoke that doesn't
cause lung cancer; I can start up again.' And kids could be persuaded
to start if they think it doesn't cause lung cancer. We could end up
with a substantial increase in the disease burden associated with
smoking."</TE>
<TE>   Being able to reduce PAHs "offers promise, but that promise has
not been studied, even in animals," Burns says. "We know very little
about the actual carcinogens people receive from this product."</TE>
<TE>   Warner says lowering the nitrosamines doesn't compromise taste.
But he says, "Nitrosamines are not the only carcinogens in tobacco
smoke. And anything combusted still has too much risk to be promoted
as [less harmful]. You're still left with heart disease, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema caused by smoking."</TE>
<TE>   A Brown &amp; Williamson spokesman says the company is not claiming
that Advance Lights reduce disease risk. The company will await the
results of test-marketing before deciding whether to market the
product nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot make any claim on the health effects because you are
still smoking a cigarette," says Mark Smith, a spokesman for Brown &amp;
Williamson. "But those smokers who are concerned with the health
consequences of smoking would see this as a step in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   However, several public health experts say they fear the
lower-toxin billing will give smokers a false sense of safety, much
the way the marketing of "light" or "low tar" cigarettes has done. In
November, the National Cancer Institute released a report on "light"
cigarettes saying that such cigarettes do nothing to lower smokers'
health risks. Smokers using "light" cigarettes inhale more deeply and
smoke more to compensate for the lower-yield cigarettes, thereby
doing nothing to reduce health risks, the report said. It called on
Congress to enact legislation barring use of the terms "light" or
"ultra-light," saying they are deceptive.</TE>
<TE>   The newer products take a somewhat different tack. Quest, due out
this summer, is of particular interest to cessation experts--who are
divided about the product's value, says Burns, senior scientific
editor of the National Cancer Institute report. Unlike Omni and
Advance Lights, Quest is made from genetically modified tobacco that
contains no nicotine--which is meant to both lower smokers' health
risks and promote cessation, says Vector's LeBow.</TE>
<TE>   Research on Quest's ability to promote cessation is underway. Duke
University researcher Jed Rose is comparing a group of smokers using
Quest and the nicotine patch with a group using Quest alone.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is whether you can give up the nicotine first while
continuing the habit," says Rose, the co-inventor of the nicotine
patch, who is now director of Duke's Nicotine Research Program.
"Maybe some people would find it easier to relinquish the smoking
habit if they first deal with the dependency on the drug."</TE>
<TE>   But the product will be available to consumers well before
research has determined its usefulness. Initially, Quest will be
marketed as a product to help with nicotine cessation. Vector is
working toward submitting data to the FDA to market Quest as a
smoking cessation product, LeBow adds.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of Quest and the reduced-carcinogen cigarettes has
renewed the call  for FDA regulation of all tobacco products--an idea
that, so far, has been spurned by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   "The nicotine patch is regulated; so is the gum. But it seems like
the cigarette industry always comes out with something new that makes
health claims, and there is no governing body to follow up on it,"
says Diane Maple, a spokeswoman for the American Lung Assn.
"Cigarette manufacturers have changed their formulas before, switched
ingredients around. Until the FDA gets the authority to look at these
products, we may never know the risks."</TE>

<DH>As researchers look more closely at the steroid dosages
used by athletes, they are ever closer to determining the risks</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former baseball star Ken Caminiti's recent statement that "at least
half" of major league players are using steroids was barely out of
his mouth before he retracted it.</LD>
<LD>   Too late; by that time the debate was in full swing on radio talk
shows, in Internet chat rooms and grocery store lines. Depending on
your point of view, athletes who dope themselves are either
hard-nosed competitors or big-time cheaters. The drugs either add
home runs or merely shorten careers. And steroid use itself is either
a harmless form of sports medicine--or a deadly gamble.</LD>
<LD>   In part, the dispute expresses simple personal bias about
performance enhancers that are illegal, except to treat disease. Yet
experts say it also reflects the controversial, and still incomplete,
science of anabolic steroids themselves, the dozens of substances now
bought and sold illicitly on the black market.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to understand that up until about 10 years ago, many in
the medical research community still doubted that these drugs had any
effect on muscle," said Dr. Shalender Bhasin, an endocrinologist at
Charles Drew University in Los Angeles. "We were studying doses of
the drugs that were much lower than what athletes were actually
taking."</TE>
<TE>   That has changed. In recent years, researchers have begun to study
higher doses of anabolic steroids, and piece together a clearer
picture of what they do to the body. Anabolic steroids mimic the
action of testosterone, which is produced naturally by male testes
and, to a lesser extent, by female adrenal glands. Levels of the
hormone first surge in boys after age 8, triggering many of the
physical changes that occur during puberty--deepening voice, increase
in lean muscle mass, acne and physical growth. By adulthood, a man
produces about 50 milligrams of the crucial hormone a week; a woman,
about a tenth of that amount. Men whose bodies produce abnormally low
amounts of testosterone--a condition called hypogonadism, often due
to chronic disease, such as AIDS--can suffer depression, sexual
malaise, fatigue and shrinkage of their gonads. In recent years,
doctors have begun treating these patients with anabolic steroids,
usually giving them what are called replacement doses, of about 100
milligrams a week.</TE>
<TE>   Weightlifters and other athletes in search of an edge may take
anywhere from 250 milligrams to more than 3,000 milligrams a week,
and most are delighted with the change in their physique, trainers
say. For example, combining doses of 600 milligrams a week with
regular workouts increases muscle size by about 8%, on average, and
strength by 10% to 15%, in just a couple of months, according to
recent research by Bhasin. "For a competitive athlete, that is a huge
gain," he said. Bhasin has also demonstrated that, as a rule, the
higher the steroid dose, the bigger and stronger the athlete becomes.</TE>
<TE>   There is a physical cost to steroid use, however, and this is
where the scientific debate begins.</TE>
<TE>   In adolescents, doctors all agree that the drugs are dangerous.
Not only can doses of steroids cause very visible problems--hair
loss, severe acne--but they often interfere with the body's own
hormone-driven development. In effect, taking steroids tricks an
adolescent body into thinking it's older, doctors say. The result:
stunted growth. The rate of steroid use at high schools increased
about 50% in the 1990s, with about 3% of students reporting they'd
used the drugs in 1999, compared with 2% in 1991, government
statistics show. "Some of these guys are stacking several steroids,
and mixing them with ephedrine and all sorts of other things," said
Dr. Gary Green, a professor of sports medicine at UCLA. "There really
is no safe level of use, as far as I'm concerned."</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to adults, however, the science is cloudier and
medical opinions vary. Doses of 1,000 milligrams a week or higher are
considered risky; yet those in the 500-milligram range may not be,
some doctors say. "I'm not convinced the drugs are all that
dangerous," said Dr. Paul D. Thompson, a cardiologist at Hartford
(Conn.) Hospital, who has studied steroid use in older men and
athletes. "I'm willing to be wrong on this. But I think we need to be
very careful speculating about serious effects. We just don't have
the data yet."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Nick Evans, an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles who has
studied steroid use, agrees. In a 1997 survey of 100 experienced
weightlifters, Evans found that two out of three steroid users
reported some noticeable health problem. Some of the problems, such
as acne and shrunken testicles, resolve themselves after users quit
the drugs; others, such as stretch marks around the muscles and
enlarged breasts, can be permanent. "These are the changes [steroid
users] perceive on their own," he said. "They don't know what's
happening to their liver and kidney function, or their endocrine
system."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers can fill in part of this story. First, taking 600
milligrams a week or more of steroids can reduce levels of HDL, or
"good," cholesterol after just a couple of months, doctors said. Low
levels of HDL directly increase a person's risk of heart disease; and
continuous steroid use over many months can drop those levels close
to zero, said Dr. Linn Goldberg, a sports medicine researcher at
Oregon Health &amp; Science University in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Some people who take steroids orally, in pill form, also develop
liver problems, due to cysts or tumors, both of which can be deadly.
Finally, taking anabolic steroids suppresses the body's own
production of testosterone: When taken continuously, they can cause
hypogonadism. In his public comments acknowledging past steroid use,
Caminiti said his testicles had shrunk and retracted.</TE>
<TE>   Despite some suspected cases of so-called "roid rage," the risk of
violent outbursts is not well understood. Some individuals
participating in research studies are more aggressive on the drugs;
most are not. The bottom line, some researchers now believe, is that
steroid use appears to heighten the risk of angry violence in people
who are disposed to it. "On the one hand, this roid rage appears to
be rare," Bhasin said. "On the other hand, it only takes one outburst
to cause very big problems."</TE>
<TE>   It's this uncertainty that has led many steroid users to believe
that the serious long-term risks of steroids have been exaggerated,
said Evans. "They say, 'I'm living proof of the benefits, the doctors
don't know what they're talking about,' " he said. "And they get all
their advice on dosing and regimes from underground handbooks and
other guys in the gym."</TE>
<TE>   Though researchers do not have good studies of long-term users to
counter this growing underground, they can point to several warning
signs. During a 1990s investigation by East German sports officials,
for example, former women athletes told stories of depression, liver
problems and internal bleeding, among other things, according to
author Steven Ungerleider, who wrote about the East German athletic
program in his 2001 book "Faust's Gold." The athletes attributed
their problems to the steroid regime.</TE>
<TE>   In another report, published in 2000, Finnish researchers tracked
the health of 62 power lifters. After 12 years, eight of the lifters,
or 13%, had died: three of suicide, three of a heart attack, one of
cancer and one of liver problems. The death rate was more than four
times higher than the rate in a group of 1,094 people of similar age
who were not bodybuilders. The difference was due in part to steroid
use, the authors speculate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this study is hardly definitive, some researchers say.
Competitive bodybuilders often take so many different
drugs--ephedrine, creatine, vitamins, sports supplements--that it's
not possible to separate the health effects of any single substance,
these researchers say. "If we really have an epidemic of use going
on, we should have a body count by now," said Thompson, the Hartford
Hospital cardiologist. "The fact is that we don't have weightlifters
dying in gyms. ... I'm not saying steroids are good for you or bad
for you: My best guess is they're bad for you. But at this point I'm
saying we really don't know."</TE>
<TE>   The growing willingness to study people taking large doses of
steroids is a sign that some investigators believe that the drugs may
be taken safely, at least for short periods of time, under close
monitoring by doctors. But in 1991 the government classified anabolic
steroids as a Schedule III controlled substance, a list that includes
opium and morphine, among other potentially dangerous drugs. "We'd
love to be able to follow a group of users and actually see what
happens to them over time," Thompson said. "The problem is, it's
illegal."</TE>
<TE>   So while bodybuilders hide their habits, and sports fans speculate
about their favorite players, doctors have no direct way to quantify
the long-term risks of what some public health officials believe is a
growing epidemic of use.</TE>
<TE>   "The larger issue is societal," Bhasin said. "As a society we
haven't come to grips with what we really think of
performance-enhancing substances. We put so much premium on winning,
it's easy to see why athletes use them. And yet we have sports, like
baseball, which have not even agreed to test for or ban steroid use."</TE>

<HD>What Body Art May Say</HD>
<DH>Study* Tattoos and piercings may indicate teens are prone
to risky behaviors such as drinking and fighting, researchers say.</DH>

<LD>Tattoos and body piercings have become so commonplace they seem
almost innocuous--even pop star Britney Spears, an idol to millions
of preteens, has a navel ring.</LD>
<LD>   But by shrugging off such adornments, parents may be doing their
kids a disservice, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   Young people who sport tattoos or have their noses, tongues,
eyebrows or bellybuttons pierced are more likely to have sex, smoke
cigarettes or marijuana, use drugs, binge drink, skip school, get
into fights and receive poor grades, according to a study in the June
issue of Pediatrics.</LD>
<TE>   "They're a marker that these kids are prone to risky behaviors,"
says Elizabeth B. Myhre, one of the study co-authors. "While there's
nothing inherently wrong with body piercing or tattoos, they are a
wake-up call to parents and physicians that there might be something
else going on with these teens."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the Naval Medical Center in San Diego surveyed 484
young people, ranging in age from 12 to 22, and found that 13.2% had
tattoos, and 26.9% had body piercings.</TE>
<TE>   Of the females, 16.6% had tattoos and 36.7% had body piercings; of
the males, 8.1% had tattoos and 10.1% had body piercings.</TE>
<TE>   Compared to their unadorned counterparts, adolescents and young
adults with tattoos or body piercings were twice as likely to engage
in sexual activity and use "gateway" drugs, such as marijuana,
alcohol and cigarettes, the researchers found, and they were three
times as likely to use hard drugs, such as Ecstasy, cocaine and
methamphetamine.</TE>
<TE>   Males with tattoos were more likely to engage in violent behavior
than those without tattoos, and females with body piercings were
twice as likely to get into fights. Also, girls and young women with
tattoos or body piercings had a higher incidence of eating disorders
and thought more about suicide. And the younger both genders were
when they got their body art, the more likely they were to be
involved with gateway drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Since most adolescents with these adornments are older than 17,
however, the tattoos and piercings could be a sign that young people
are already in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably not the first risky thing they've done," said Dr.
Victoria Paterno, a Santa Monica pediatrician. "They've already been
drinking, and smoking cigarettes or marijuana. If you haven't picked
up on other cues earlier, then you're probably pretty clueless as a
parent."</TE>

<HD>Those 'Less Talented' Muscles Deserve Equal Time</HD>
<DH>The Right Moves</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN VOIGHT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All of us are good at doing some things and not so good at doing
others. More often than not, we like to work on the former--and
ignore the latter.</LD>
<LD>   When it comes to exercise, the tendency to focus mainly on our
favorite muscles can get us into trouble. If we constantly perform
movements that overwork certain muscles, neglecting to stretch them
or strengthen others, we throw our bodies out of balance. This
syndrome can lead to overuse injuries and chronic pain.</LD>
<LD>   Let's say you had naturally strong legs when you were younger.
Skiing and cycling came easily, and at the gym you could probably
handle a lot of weight when doing leg presses and squats. It was easy
for you to excel in any sport or activity that required strong legs,
so you probably enjoyed pushing yourself and ended up making your
legs more powerful. But you probably didn't stretch and cross-train.</LD>
<TE>   Now jump ahead a decade. Do you find that with those strong legs
comes a dull ache in your lower back or a sharp pain in your knee? If
so, you're feeling the effects of muscular imbalance.</TE>
<TE>   So what can you do? Start by making up your mind to pay equal
attention to the "less talented" areas of your body, and be patient
if they don't respond as quickly as your favorite ones. Second,
remember that all muscles work in pairs and that we need to stretch
as well as strengthen them. Always put quality ahead of quantity when
working out. This means that no matter what you do, you need to
maintain control over your body. Begin to regulate all your movements
with the intention of preserving your joints and protecting your
skeletal system. Quality movement is not traumatic; it is safe,
precise and fluid.</TE>
<TE>   To get your body primed for action, begin with these two moves to
stretch the front of your thighs and hips. Usually the fronts of our
legs are stronger and tighter than the backs. Use the first stretch
as a way to loosen the quadriceps (the muscles in the front of the
upper thigh) and to prepare for the more advanced move that not only
stretches the front of the legs and hips but also the abdominals,
chest and shoulders. As you continue to practice, you will gradually
develop more strength in the upper back, buttocks and hamstrings.</TE>
<TE>   A. Lie face down on a mat or a soft surface with your legs
extended behind you. Bend your right knee and hold the ankle with
your right hand. Gently pull your heel to your buttocks. Your knees
can be slightly apart, but your thighs should be parallel to each
other. Tuck your hips under and pull your navel in toward your spine.
Relax and feel a deep stretch in the front of your right thigh. Hold
this stretch while you breathe evenly for 15 seconds. Repeat on the
other side.</TE>
<TE>   B. Lie face down on a mat or a soft surface. Bend both knees,
bringing your heels toward your buttocks. Your knees can be slightly
apart, but your thighs should remain parallel. Reach back with your
hands and hold your ankles.</TE>
<TE>   On an inhale, press your feet into your hands and move your
shoulders down, away from your ears. Lift your head, chest and knees
off the floor as you continue to reach for the ceiling with your
feet. If you cannot reach your ankles, you can hold a strap around
your ankles so that your hands are a few inches away from your feet.
Relax your abdominals, neck and throat. Hold for 15 seconds as you
continue to breathe evenly. Gradually increase the amount of time you
stay in this position.</TE>
<TE>   To come out of the pose, lower your torso and thighs to the floor,
release your feet and rest your forehead on the mat. Relax for 15
seconds and repeat two more times.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be great if we could continue to be physically active
our whole lives without getting so many aches and pains? We can, as
long as we pay attention to how our body feels when we're moving.</TE>
<TE>   Whether young or old, we can focus in on our bodies and notice
subtle signals that alert us to the "good" and "bad" sensations we're
feeling. Soon we'll discover little quirks that are specific to our
own bodies and learn to accommodate them.</TE>
<TE>   Physical activity is supposed to make us feel better, not worse,
so if we exercise with more integrity, the movements will be easier
on our bodies, making them more effective and enjoyable. By
practicing intelligent exercise, we might even accomplish the
unthinkable--looking forward to the next time.</TE>

<LD>What's not to love about a dog--especially when the dog is
Scooby-Doo, the cartoon canine who gained fame in all those
Hanna-Barbera cartoons?</LD>
<LD>   Well, Warner Bros. will find out this weekend, when it releases
its new family comedy caper, "Scooby-Doo," scheduled to hit theaters
nationwide Friday.</LD>
<LD>   By some accounts, the movie--featuring the animated Scooby-Doo and
his live-action, crime-solving cohorts--could be a surprise hit.
Advanced tracking appears strong, indicating the film could take in
$25 million or more in its opening weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Although it features two high-profile young actors in Freddie
Prinze Jr. as Fred and Sarah Michelle Gellar (of TV's "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer") as Daphne, the real star of this picture is
Scooby-Doo. The film also features Matthew Lillard as Shaggy and
Linda Cardellini as Velma.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has had mixed success transforming TV cartoons into
big-screen, live-action films.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know which of these TV properties is going to resonate
strongly enough with the moviegoers," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of the box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. "
'The Flintstones' did it, 'Dudley Do-Right' didn't."</TE>

<HD>Los Lobos' Universal Note</HD>
<DH>For nearly 30 years the Chicano band has appealed to a
broad audience with its eclectic sounds. A new album furthers the
communal tone.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In some ways, Los Lobos never change.</LD>
<LD>   They have always been performers of few words, rock stars without
special effects or mannerisms or choreography. No big fanfare greets
the greatest Chicano band of all time. They casually walk out on
stage, as they did Friday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and
as they have for almost 30 years, pick up their instruments and
simply start to play.</LD>
<LD>   Mostly, they just stand there. They don't prance or jump around or
even grimace during searing guitar solos that might tempt lesser
rockers into attention-grabbing antics.</LD>
<TE>   Los Lobos lie back and let their music do the talking. It's the
fans who get excited. The crowd's bicultural cheers--from yahoo to
ajua!--signaled the band's broad appeal. Admirers came in all colors,
ages and styles. They were foreign-born and native-born, Westside and
Eastside, Hollywood hip and San Fernando Valley blue-collar.</TE>
<TE>   Once, this may have been just another band from East L.A., to
borrow the title of their 1978 debut album of Mexican folk music.
Today, Los Lobos are a band for Los Angeles at large--grounded in one
heritage while embracing others, respecting the past while always
looking forward.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not the band that changed. The city did. UCLA student Ian
Brown, 22, was still a child when Los Lobos was picked band of the
year in Rolling Stone critics' poll of 1985, the year of their highly
acclaimed album, "How Will the Wolf Survive?" Brown recalls listening
to that groundbreaking work while riding with his parents in the
family car. Now, the English major and aspiring musician admires the
seamless "convergence of influences" in Los Lobos' eclectic sound.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only band that can do it in a way that meshes so well
together," Brown said while waiting for the show to start. "I think
they're brilliant."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's masterful two-hour set--a down-home jambalaya of rock and
rancheras, country and cumbias, blues and boleros--featured several
selections from the band's new album, "Good Morning Aztlan."</TE>
<TE>   Fans swayed and danced, or just smiled at one another to
acknowledge a grooving bass riff by Conrad Lozano or the cumulative
sonic thrill of three front-line guitars wielded by David Hidalgo,
Cesar Rosas and Louie Perez.</TE>
<TE>   The four former Garfield High School buddies formed the band in
1973. Steve Berlin, on keyboards, sax and flute, joined 10 years
later. (The recent addition of two honorary Lobos, percussionists
Cougar Estrada and Victor Bisetti, add punch to the live sound.)</TE>
<TE>   Los Lobos emerged in the angry days of the Chicano Movement, two
years after a violent antiwar riot engulfed their East L.A. community
in 1971. Perez recalls the pressure they felt from the radicals of
the day, cultural separatists promoting a self-governing nation under
the concept of Aztlan, the mythical homeland of the Aztecs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that was ridiculous," says Perez, who sat with Hidalgo
and Berlin for a brief interview Thursday before a record release
concert at Club Fais Do Do. "They wanted us to be political, and we
just wanted to play music."</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the band now waves the Aztlan flag in the title of
their new song, which deftly sketches scenes from daily life in the
barrio. But the evocative images, they argue, are calculated to hit a
universal chord of family, neighborhood and community.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking it [Aztlan] back to the more pure definition: You
can go home again," Perez explains.</TE>
<TE>   To some kids in East L.A., Los Lobos were as big as the Beatles.
It seemed only a matter of time for other Chicano bands to follow
their footsteps from the barrio to the big time. "We really thought
that was going to happen," Perez says. "We thought we were opening
the doors, but nobody came through."</TE>
<TE>   Today, there's renewed hope with a new generation of promising
bands, such as Quetzal, which opened at the House of Blues. At the
show's finale, Los Lobos were joined on stage by three members of a
local punk-rock band, Los Villains. This wasn't simple promotion; it
was a little nepotism. The young musicians happen to be the Lobos'
offspring, sons of Hidalgo and Perez.</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta back up the kids," says Hidalgo, who puts a Los
Villains sticker on his accordion.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the extent of his retirement plan," Berlin jokes. "They're
his 401(k)."</TE>
<TE>   "That's my future," agrees Hidalgo, but he wasn't laughing.</TE>
<TE>   Commercially, Los Lobos have struggled. The band has always been
hard to categorize for radio formats. Too Latin for Anglos and too
Anglo for Latinos, as their manager puts it. They had their biggest
hit with "La Bamba," the 1987 soundtrack of the film about '50s rock
star Ritchie Valens, which yielded a No. 1 single. But even that
multi-platinum success didn't boost sales of other albums, notes
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Creatively, it didn't dazzle or derail them either. "It actually
forced us to stick to our guns," Hidalgo says. "It was fun, but we
knew it was temporary. We didn't own it."</TE>
<TE>   The following year, the band came back with a collection of
traditional Mexican songs titled "La Pistola Y El Corazon" (The
Pistol and the Heart).They still remember it fondly as one of their
favorite projects, a joy to make.</TE>
<TE>   "And it does what we started out to do--share our culture with a
larger audience," Hidalgo says.</TE>
<TE>   Los Lobos seem happy to be on the road again. They cruised around
town last week in a big, lumbering RV, making stops for almost
nightly performances, including an in-store one at Amoeba Music in
Hollywood and a short set for "LATV Live," a local Latin music show
on cable station KJLH.</TE>
<TE>   "If it all ended tomorrow," muses Perez, "I think we'd be really
proud of what we've accomplished."</TE>

<LD>How real is television "reality"?</LD>
<LD>   Although TV has always indulged in wordspin, its tongue is
especially slippery these days in deploying such white lies as
"reality," self-serving euphemisms and other glossy terms to
deceptively market products and ideas.</LD>
<LD>   It's not only TV, of course. Just as real estate ads promote
rickety houses as needing your "tender loving care," however, and
clunkers formerly known as used cars are now "pre-owned," our old TV
friend, the "rerun," has gained stature too.</LD>
<TE>   It's now an "encore" in TV promos aimed at the public. The smart
money in industry circles says viewers are less likely to reject an
"encore episode" than something called a rerun. If it's an encore, in
other words, it must be really swell.</TE>
<TE>   As if all America had given this sucker a standing ovation and
demanded its immediate return to the airwaves, and programmers were
helpless to resist the will of the public.</TE>
<TE>   When "encore" runs its course, do we get "pre-seen?"</TE>
<TE>   Words help shape our perceptions, both in entertainment and the
darker catacombs of human behavior. You don't need a TV columnist to
inform you that "terrorist" fits anyone seeking to intimidate by
crashing a jet into a high-rise or detonating a bomb with the intent
to murder civilians. "Butcher" works here too.</TE>
<TE>   But are Palestinians in the West Bank "soldiers" or "gunmen" when
firing at Israeli troops rolling in on a mission of destruction? The
two words have unequal moral standing.</TE>
<TE>   And is the U.S. fighting a "war against terror," as the government
and most media have said for nine months, or a "war against
Islamists?" The latter was floated on CNN last week by the host of
TV's most misleadingly titled program, "Lou Dobbs Moneyline." Showing
you the money is hardly its only function.</TE>
<TE>   "The enemies in this war are radical Islamics who argue that all
nonbelievers in their faith must be killed," said Dobbs. Called to
action by his epiphany, he announced he was dumping "war against
terror" in favor of "war against Islamists."</TE>
<TE>   Dobbs stressed that this was no war "against Muslims or Islam or
Islamics," just "Islamists" and their allies, and that "if there were
ever a time for clarity, it is now." Way to go.</TE>
<TE>   But let's see. Not Islam or Islamics, but "Islamists." Yeah,
that's clarity.</TE>
<TE>   This is one gimmick that deserves to be buried, swiftly, with the
pet rock. Next night, the Dobbster was cautioned wisely on the air by
former Defense Secretary William Cohen that trying to sever
"Islamists" from Islam and Islamics may give people "the wrong idea"
by appearing to indict all followers of Islam as terrorists. In other
words, Dobbs can parse all he wants, but get real here. Most viewers
hearing "Islamists" will think "Islamics," and extend that to every
Muslim. Or is it Muslimist?</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Fox News Channel is now calling Palestinian suicide
bombings "homicide bombings," as if the former did not impose guilt.
News-lite MSNBC has anointed itself "America's News Channel," even
though most Americans don't know it from Shinola.</TE>
<TE>   And until recently, the most misused term by this hemisphere's
media was "politically correct," which too many Americans apply to
anything they don't support. The smug assumption is that only their
beliefs result from conviction, while the rest of us, with whom they
disagree, are motivated solely by fear of controversy or what's in
vogue at the moment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet no reign lasts forever, and "politically correct" has been
blasted from its throne by TV's latest overused and misused word of
the century.</TE>
<TE>   "Reality."</TE>
<TE>   Blame "An American Family," the pioneering 1973 PBS series that
kept a camera on the Louds of Santa Barbara for weeks, becoming a
"reality" prototype by capturing a marriage on the skids, while
attracting such attention that the series was spoofed in a movie by
Albert Brooks.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 30 years later, shows mislabeled "reality" are surfacing on
TV like measles spots, as industry copycats fall over themselves
trying to cash in on the "Survivor" phenomenon and join this CBS
franchise's fast-spreading progeny.</TE>
<TE>   Turning their heads are recent high ratings for "The Bachelor" on
ABC (real guy, real babes, real dumb) and "The Osbournes," a highly
popular MTV series that closely monitors the lives of rock star Ozzy
Osbourne and his family, affirming that even daily minutiae can
seduce a large audience.</TE>
<TE>   These are called "reality" shows. But the concept of "reality" is
as laughable here as on the tightly edited "Survivor" series. Try
living your life in front of cameras and TV crews and see how real
you can be.</TE>
<TE>   Even funnier, though, is how show after show is now being sold to
viewers as "reality," as producers and their networks embrace this
fantasy the way politicians kiss babies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, for example, found ABC boasting that its two-parter
"The Hamptons" was TV's "first reality miniseries." It's true that
Hamptonians are, indeed, members of the human race (sort of). But in
fact, "The Hamptons" was nothing more than a documentary (a musty
word banished from TV's promotional vocabulary), and a weak one from
the usually accomplished Barbara Kopple. Far from being
revolutionary, it was executed in a style used for decades by that
master documentarian, Frederick Wiseman.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, TBS insists that more history is about to be made.
Coming next month is its "Worst-Case Scenario," billed as TV's first
"reality" magazine series. That is if you call "reality"
demonstrating "cool gadgets that help people avoid dangerous
situations."</TE>
<TE>   Or dangerous hyperbole, as in ABC News running radio promos last
week saying its prime-time six-part series, "Boston 24/7," offered
"so much reality it's unreal."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's profits are surely real. But reality in news? It's a
troubling concept.</TE>

<HD>Ramones Gathering: A Celebration</HD>

<LD>The death last Wednesday of Ramones founding member Dee Dee Ramone,
a.k.a. Douglas Colvin, won't derail a combination Ramones
tribute/record release party/fund-raiser taking place this week in
New York City. "Now it's more of a tribute than we'd ever planned,"
event co-organizer Johnny Chiba said.</LD>
<LD>   The main purpose of Wednesday night's performance at Don Hill's
Nightclub is to raise money for the Joey Ramone Lymphoma Research
Fund, set up at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center, following
the death last year of the Ramones' lanky singer.</LD>
<LD>   But the show also serves as a record release party for "Ramones
Forever--An International Tribute." It's the first U.S. release of an
album issued in slightly different form last year in Belgium, with
covers of Ramones songs by several Belgian bands and performers from
Peru, the Netherlands, Hungary, Germany, Greece and a few from the
United States.</LD>
<TE>   Performers at Wednesday's concert will include Type O Negative
singer Pete Steele, singer Mike Blank from punk band Blank 77, punk
drag queen Jayne County and others.</TE>
<TE>   Bassist Dee Dee Ramone was credited as the pioneering punk band's
chief songwriter and the one who shouted "1, 2, 3, 4!" at the
beginning of each song, an opening that became the group's signature.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there are going to be a lot of Ramones fans there who
will be wanting to commiserate over Dee Dee's death," Chiba said.
"But we're not promoting anything of that nature. We're celebrating
the Ramones, we're celebrating Joey's life, and, in that respect, now
we're going to be celebrating Dee Dee's life as well, as opposed to
memorializing them."</TE>
<TE>   Chiba said that in addition to receiving $1,000 or more from the
concert, the Joey Ramone Lymphoma Research Fund will get 20% of
profits from sales of the "Ramones Forever" album. A Web site,
www.radicalrecords.com, has been set up to allow visitors to download
MP3 files of several of the album's 23 songs and to obtain other
information about the project.</TE>

<HD>Journalist Files Lawsuit Against KCBS</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Angela Black was highly visible on the local TV scene during the
1980s at KABC's "Eyewitness News," when she was one of a few female,
African American weekday news anchors. Her new role, however, will be
that of news subject as opposed to reporter, casting her as the
plaintiff in a lawsuit against her most recent employer, KCBS, where
she was a general assignment reporter and fill-in anchor.</LD>
<LD>   In a Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that has been transferred
to Federal Court, Black accuses KCBS of racism, age and sex
discrimination, retaliation, slander and defamation of character. She
claims she was fired without cause or notice in September, less than
a year after being hired by the Viacom-owned station. She signed a
contract with the station in November 2000, in which the station had
an option to extend her agreement two additional years after the
first one.</LD>
<LD>   Black, 52, who is holding a news conference this week hoping to
generate publicity for her case, is seeking her job back and
unspecified damages.</LD>
<TE>   She says most of her difficulties were with the station's former
news director, Roger Bell, who left late last year. She had
previously worked under Bell during her stint at KABC and said he had
also fired her at that station. But Black also contends that KCBS
targeted other on-air personalities older than 40 and denied African
Americans opportunities as news anchors.</TE>
<TE>   Bell now lives outside California and could not be reached for
comment. A spokesman for CBS, the parent of KCBS, said in response to
Black's accusations, "The station unequivocally rejects the notion
that any kind of discrimination played a role in its relationship
with Miss Black, and the station will defend itself accordingly. The
fact is Miss Black had a one-year employment agreement with the
station, which was not renewed at its conclusion. Miss Black's
allegation that the station's decision was discriminatory is simply
untrue."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Aztlan Fest 2002, the third annual gathering of rock en espanol bands
from California and Mexico, drew a small but energetic crowd Saturday
to the parking lot of the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles.
The daylong festival featured an array of musical styles, from
head-banging heavy metal to punk, ska and hip-hop.</LD>
<LD>   The bill featured some two dozen groups, including Flattbush, the
multiethnic Filipino/Anglo/Chicano band from Wilmington, and
Nocturne, considered the Mexican Marilyn Manson of East L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Among the other groups: Garrobos, a thrash metal outfit from
Mexico City; Ankla, a tropical metal fusion featuring a former member
of Puerto Rico's Puya; and Bye Sami, a Tijuana band about to release
a new album on L.A.'s new SourPOP Records.</LD>
<TE>   The bands played continuously on two stages, named Pyramid of the
Sun and Mictlan the Underworld. This year's festival also featured
Mexican wrestling in a small, separate ring.</TE>

<HD>Pet Shop Boys 'Release' Concert Craftsmanship</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Throughout their long career, the British synth-pop duo the Pet Shop
Boys have exhibited a buoyancy that has made it easy for many pop
fans to look past the nuances of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe's smart
craftsmanship.</LD>
<LD>   However, it was that craftsmanship that was on display Friday when
the self-described "new Pet Shop Boys" performed at the Universal
Amphitheatre on a tour in support of the new album, "Release."</LD>
<LD>   Familiar numbers, such as the buoyant "West End Girls," "It's a
Sin" and their reworking of the Willie Nelson hit "Always on My
Mind," formed the heart of the pair's 90-minute set, but crucial
moments were given to the new CD--with mixed results.</LD>
<TE>   Having stripped themselves of the theatrics that used to accompany
their shows, the Boys, backed by a four-piece band that included
drums, guitar, bass and a programmer, are using this tour to
introduce themselves as musicians (hence the term "new Pet Shop
Boys").</TE>
<TE>   Despite the fact the concert showed the band's vulnerable side
musically (Lowe described it afterward as like being naked), the
lighting kept the band in mostly shadows through much of the set. If
those gray silhouettes gave a cool effect, there's something
disconcerting about watching a lead singer whose face you never can
make out, particularly when he's crooning a ballad, as on the new
"The Night I Fell in Love."</TE>
<TE>   Another problems was pacing. For a veteran act, their sequencing
was surprisingly off. Every time the crowd would get into the show,
the band would pull out another ballad that put the fans back in
their seats. An example: placing the new "Love Is a Catastrophe,"
which was a slow, though moving number, between the upbeat "West End
Girls" and the closing "Go West," one of the highlights of the night.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, Tennant and Lowe showed an impressive
artistic resolve in giving so much space to "Release." If Friday's
concert showed they haven't entirely worked out this new direction
yet, they are at least on the right path.</TE>

<HD>The Sum of 'Fears' Again Adds Up to No. 1</HD>
<DH>Box Office* The Tom Clancy adaptation holds off 'Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood' in a fairly quiet weekend.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The nuclear terrorism thriller "The Sum of All Fears" continued to
add up with moviegoers, taking in $18.7 million to remain the No. 1
film for a second weekend.</LD>
<LD>   "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood" opened in second place
with $16.35 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "Bad Company," another film about a stray nuclear device, proved a
bit of a bomb. It premiered in fourth place with just $10.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   Rounding out the top five were the year's biggest hits. "Star
Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" was No. 3 with $13.9 million,
lifting its total to $255 million after 25 days. "Spider-Man" came in
fifth with $10 million for a 38-day total of $370.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The industry rebounded after last weekend, when the overall box
office slumped for the first time in nearly four months. The top 12
movies this weekend grossed $101.7 million, up about 8% from the same
weekend last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was a relatively quiet weekend compared with most of
May, when "Spider-Man" and "Attack of the Clones" drove up revenue by
50% or more each weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sum of All Fears," starring Ben Affleck in an adaptation of
the Tom Clancy bestseller, has taken in $61.8 million in 10 days and
should wind up topping $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Ya-Ya Sisterhood" stars Sandra Bullock, Ellen Burstyn, Ashley
Judd, Maggie Smith and James Garner in a tale of lifelong friends
trying to repair a mother-daughter rift. The film drew a mostly
female crowd but got a positive reaction from male viewers, too, said
Dan Fellman, head of distribution for Warner Bros., which released
the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad Company," one of several terrorism flicks delayed last fall
after the Sept. 11 attacks, stars Anthony Hopkins as a CIA boss who
recruits a street hustler (Chris Rock) to foil terrorists trying to
obtain a nuclear device.</TE>
<TE>   The film got generally good scores from audiences, leaving
distributor Disney puzzled over its weak performance.</TE>
<TE>   "You can sit there and say, 'They liked it; what went wrong?' "
said Chuck Viane, the studio's head of distribution. "And you don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   "Attack of the Clones" continues to slump well behind its
predecessor, "Episode I The Phantom Menace," which was approaching
$300 million by this point three years ago. Factoring in ticket
prices that are about 16% higher today, "Attack of the Clones"
grossed less than half the $25.6 million "The Phantom Menace" did in
its corresponding fourth weekend.</TE>

as the No. 1 film.</CP>

<HD>Duo Chorales Elevate Sacred Verses at UCLA</HD>

<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Composed in 1933, Ernest Bloch's "Avodath Hakodesh" (Sacred Service)
brings the majesty and beauty of Hebrew sacred texts out of the
synagogue and into the concert hall.</LD>
<LD>   The five-part work, which ranges from the gentle to the sublime,
from the assertive to the mystical, made a mighty impact Saturday in
UCLA's Royce Hall as Donald Neuen led the combined UCLA and Angeles
chorales and the American Youth Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   If any complaint could be raised, it would be that Neuen and the
200 voices of the combined chorales fell into the "loud is better"
syndrome, equating relentlessly high decibels with deep conviction.
Nathan Lam, cantor of Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air, was the
authoritative baritone soloist.</LD>
<TE>   The program opened with the world premiere of Steve Rothstein's
Psalm 27, a 14-minute rhapsodic, urgent setting of verses from this
text. The work is expansive and rich but never cloying. Rothstein is
a graduate student in composition at UCLA and a member of the UCLA
Chorale. Duana Demus, a doctoral student in voice at UCLA, was the
cautious, sometimes taxed soprano soloist in the demanding,
wide-lying part.</TE>
<TE>   For the midpoint offering, Thea Kano, assistant conductor of the
Angeles Chorale and a graduate student in choral conducting at UCLA,
led a squarish account of Leonard Bernstein's "Chichester Psalms."
Daniel McGrew, a third-grader at the Crystal Cathedral Academy for
the Arts, was the poised boy soprano soloist.</TE>

<HD>Pasadena Symphony's Grand Finale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Year in, year out, Jorge Mester proves that you can pump new life
into the shopworn overture-concerto-symphony concert format if you
dig a little into the repertoire. In doing so at the Pasadena
Symphony season finale Saturday night in the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium, he didn't even have to reach outside the letter "B."</LD>
<LD>   Mester opened with one of those overlooked masterpieces that CD
collectors know all about but are hardly ever performed live:
Britten's stark, arching, terrifying, eloquent Sinfonia da Requiem,
an astonishingly profound work for a 25-year-old composer. Mester
took its full measure, adopting an unusually rhythmic approach to the
opening funeral march with clear-cut detail and unsuppressed
dissonances, getting the middle section to snarl and gallop, building
the consoling finale to a massive, thick climax. Evidently he
relishes this piece, and the orchestra gave him an electric response.</LD>
<LD>   Bartok's brittle Piano Concerto No. 1 is another relatively
esoteric concert hall item; not only is it a difficult piece, it also
must be a thankless one for many ego-driven pianists, since their
instrument rarely jumps out into the virtuoso spotlight.</LD>
<TE>   Pianist Christopher O'Riley actually brought some poetic repose to
the middle of the first movement while putting up a solid percussive
display elsewhere, and Mester's crew overcame a tentative opening
movement with driving work in the finale.</TE>
<TE>   Though the evening would have been even more interesting had
Mester selected another great 20th century "B" to complete the
set--and there are plenty of them--it was easy to live with a
Beethoven Symphony No. 7 performed with such unimpeded,
straight-ahead, life-affirming momentum, coming to a satisfying peak
down the stretch in the finale.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to Beethoven, eight French horn players and a trombonist
serenaded retiring (after 50 years) Pasadena Symphony Orchestra horn
player George Hyde with a brief, pleasing, highly imaginative
composition of his, "Color Contrasts."</TE>

<HD>Singer Raya Yarbrough Wields Still-Emerging Tools</HD>
<DH>Her promise as a performer and songwriter shines through
problems with pacing and her backup band.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The remarkable success stories generated by Diana Krall, Jane Monheit
and Norah Jones, among others, have driven record companies to spread
widening nets in search of young female jazz singers with similar
breakout possibilities. Aside from the instant impact of Jones--whose
first album (despite its presence on the Blue Note jazz label) had a
distinctly country quality--the initial results of the quests have
been uncertain, at best.</LD>
<LD>   Singer Raya Yarbrough's performance at Lunaria on Friday night
provided a good example of the problems inherent in focusing upon
talent that, whatever its potential, is still young and relatively
untested. Although she is just on the verge of graduating from USC's
music school, Yarbrough already has been the subject of interest by a
number of labels. And, from a purely fundamental perspective, her
talent warrants the attention.</LD>
<LD>   But talent and achievement are entirely different matters, and
Yarbrough's unquestioned skills as a singer and songwriter are still
in the very early stages of development.</LD>
<TE>   On the plus side, her voice is a pliable, versatile instrument, an
effective vehicle for a musical expression that ranges freely from
pop-style balladry to surprisingly effective scat singing. She also
has a perceptive ear for the flow of melody and the textures of
harmony, and a potent feeling for swing is present in all her
rhythmic lines. Although the lyrics to her songs were difficult to
decipher, given the volume level of her backup band, her originals
seemed to blend expressive lyrics with an obviously imaginative
musical vision.</TE>
<TE>   On the still-developing side, Yarbrough's voice tended toward
thinness in her upper register--oddly reminiscent at times of Laura
Nyro's less intriguing efforts--and there were too many instances of
unfocused pitch intonation. Nor did she help her presentation by
allowing her players, especially drummer Nadir Jeevanjee, to play at
an intensity level that tended to bury the more subtle facets of her
singing.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, she made a further misstep by electing to open her set
with several unfamiliar numbers, presumably originals, thereby
failing to give her audience a connective link until she finally got
around to singing the Sigmund Romberg/Oscar Hammerstein standard
"Softly, As in a Morning Sunrise."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, it was with this number that Yarbrough's real
capabilities came shining through the music. Arching her melodic line
with improvisational alacrity, she tossed in effective scatting,
remained in contact with the song's story, and energized it all with
driving rhythmic propulsion. All the elements, in other words, that
go into first-rate jazz vocalizing.</TE>
<TE>   This sort of mixture of pluses and minuses is not uncommon in a
young, just-emerging artist, of course. Balanced out, the sum adds up
to a talent with considerable potential. Both Yarbrough and the
record company with whom she eventually signs would do well, however,
to take the time and effort needed to allow that potential to mature
naturally, without the pressure of high-level, instant expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Given that approach, she may well be one of the significant
catches in the rush to capture gifted new jazz vocal artists.</TE>

<HD>Judy Garland's 'Day-by-Day' Legacy</HD>
<DH>Scott Schechter's book not only chronicles her difficult
life, but also proves how hard she worked to overcome obstacles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>June 10, 1922, 5:30 a.m.: Judy was born as Frances Ethel Gumm, in
Grand Rapids, Minnesota. Frances was delivered by Dr. H.E. Binet of
Grand Rapids, at Itasca Hospital. Weight at birth was 7 pounds.</LD>
<LD>   --"Judy Garland: The Day-by-Day  Chronicle of a Legend"  by Scott
Schechter</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Judy Garland archivist Scott Schechter has a stack of the
"greatest rejection letters I have ever seen" regarding his
exhaustively researched--as the excerpted item above
indicates--438-page book "Judy Garland: The Day-by-Day Chronicle of a
Legend" (Cooper Square Press, $26.95), which arrives in stores today
on what would have been Garland's 80th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   "They loved the book, but they didn't know what to do with it,"
Schechter says. "It was such a massive tome. It's not a straight bio.
It was really hard for publishers to pigeonhole it." Last summer,
though, his agent hooked him up with the editorial director of Cooper
Square Press who agreed to publish it.</TE>
<TE>   The book chronicles nearly every day of Garland's life from her
days as queen of the MGM musicals, her battles with drugs and
alcohol, failed marriages, her children, her financial problems,
comebacks and her death in 1969 at age 47. It also includes her last
will and testament and even who was listed in her final phone book.</TE>
<TE>   Entries range from the mundane: "On October 21: A check was issued
to: Mel Burns Ford, 2000 Long Beach, Calif., for $163.88 (payment for
Judy's cars)" to the dramatic: "May 28, 1964: ... Judy took an
overdose of pills ... Judy's stomach was pumped--damaging her vocal
cords with the tubes--and she was in a coma for 15 hours. At one
point a valve actually broke on her oxygen tent, until it was fixed,
Judy hadn't moved; therefore, a nurse left the room saying Judy had
died...."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter jokes that he converted to "Judyism" in 1974 at the age
of 13 when he went to see the acclaimed documentary on MGM musicals
"That's Entertainment" that featured clips of such Garland classic
films as "The Wizard of Oz," "The Harvey Girls," "Meet Me in St.
Louis" and "Summer Stock."</TE>
<TE>   "Someone also gave me a copy of the album of 'Judy at Carnegie
Hall,' and one of the local stations in Philadelphia, where I am
from, showed one of her concert TV shows," Schechter says. "There was
another local station that bought a package of MGM musicals, and my
mom would actually let me stay home from school on the afternoons
when there was a Judy movie."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter didn't have any idea at the age of 13 that Garland would
become his life's work. "But it was love at first sight and first
hearing," he says. "There is something about her soul I had never
experienced with any other performer. Judy just ripped her heart open
and said, 'Here it is.' "</TE>
<TE>   As early as 1975, Schechter started working on his book. "I
started transcribing what she would say about herself from
interviews, and it grew from there," he says. "With my move to New
York in 1985, I started obviously using the great resources they have
here--all the libraries. I think by 1987 I had a rough draft that was
evolving more into an in-depth study about how she lived her life and
what her life meant."</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the information featured in the book came from the Arthur
Freed archives at UCLA. Freed was the top musical producer at MGM and
Garland made most of her films for his production unit. "They had the
assistant director's daily logs, and of course, on a movie set, time
is money, and every moment was recorded."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't put in every moment of Garland's life on the set or the
book would have run over a 1,000 pages, but he did extensively
chronicle her ill-fated experience on "Annie Get Your Gun," from
which she was fired in 1950 due to her personal problems.</TE>
<TE>   "She was pretty much there on set," Schechter says. "People have
this impression of her never showing up for work. Even at the end of
her life she had these huge concert shows and TV shows. She did not
stop. She didn't take vacation. This is a woman who lived to share
her gift, her artistry."</TE>
<TE>   Schechter maintains everybody spends far too much time chronicling
what was wrong in Garland's life when "there was so much that went
right. She has this massive body of work with 50 films, 60 TV shows
and easily 1,500 live performances and 100 single recordings and a
dozen albums. You don't get to have that body of work if you are just
living to marry or check in the hospital. I think Judy Garland coped
awfully well with her life given what she had to deal with from Day
One."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, he says, was probably the worst stage mother on
record. "She was just truly horrific," Schechter says. "And to be a
property at the age of 13 when you are signed to do this huge studio
and by the time you are 17 you become a major star with 'The Wizard
of Oz.' I can't imagine what that felt like. She was seen as a
property first and a person second."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to some views of her, Schechter believes Garland was not
a weak person who constantly wilted under pressure. "She was
incredibly strong and incredibly bright. That is the only way she
could have gotten through and achieved what she did."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With the sweet scent of jasmine in the air, the sun dipping below the
horizon, and the gurgling fountains in the Getty Center's main
courtyard as bucolic backdrop, butoh master Oguri brought his
site-specific, 75-minute work, "In the Shallows," to amazing life
Friday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Accompanied by composer Yuval Ron on keyboards and the mesmerizing
vocals of Bulgarian singers Tsvetanka Varimezova and Angela Rodel
(strategically placed on balconies above the area), Oguri and his
company, Renzoku, shepherded the audience on an awesome journey.</LD>
<LD>   Exploring the connection between humans and the Getty's
architectural environment, the dancers took advantage of natural
elements--wind, water and foliage, but more importantly, space.
Moving from fountain to fountain, tree to tree, and travertine wall
to travertine wall, the performers created a tableau of unsurpassed
mystery. With billowing beige silk costumes (Oguri in a dress is a
sight to behold), and Magritte-like faces (whitish makeup,
accentuated by painted-on, Groucho-esque eyebrows and mustaches, and
hot pink lips and cheeks), this was inspired butoh.</LD>
<TE>   Whether on his back with head hanging over a platform, or crawling
on his knees, his face a tortured smile, Oguri is the consummate
artist: Enigmatic, he is an emotional vessel through which life's
secrets unfold. Deftly aided by company members Roxanne Steinberg,
Jamie Burris, Eric Binkley, Jean Copeland and Mia Doi Todd, Oguri
climaxed the performance by unfurling his own brand of red
carpet--brown butcher paper--upon which the dancers slowly paraded
into the exquisite night.</TE>

<HD>Mickey Would Blush at Radio Disney's Hits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER MOORE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To dismiss today's teeny-bopper music as shallow, tedious and
unlistenable is to ignore how much genuine talent goes into making it
morally repugnant as well. But if you think I'm one of those
fortysomething parents gearing up for a middle-aged rant against the
evils of Britney Spears, think again. Because honestly, I'm only in
my mid-30s (39, to be exact).</LD>
<LD>   Also, just to clarify, I am not an uptight, cultural conservative.
I would rather eat lightbulbs than listen to five minutes of Dr.
Laura. Then again, I would rather eat lightbulbs than listen to five
seconds of Radio Disney, the popular kids' station heard nationwide
and in Southern California on KDIS-AM (710).</LD>
<LD>   It's not so much the songs, which--if you subtract the lyrics and
music--are top-notch. It's more the way Radio Disney cultivates a
squeaky-clean image while peddling suggestive, teen-oriented fare to
its primary audience of 6- to 11-year-olds. What kind of Mickey Mouse
operation is this, anyway?</LD>
<TE>   The Times reported in December that Radio Disney test-markets
music in focus groups of children as young as 6. Call me Dopey, but
if the resulting playlist is any indication, this process is designed
to generate advance buzz for the next teen movie soundtrack, not to
gauge suitability of content for the kindergarten crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, you won't hear profanity, gangsta rap or subliminal satanic
messages. But you will hear teen and preteen idols encouraging minors
to engage in adult behavior ("Yo, it's gonna be da bomb!") or waxing
poetic about that proverbial awkward phase between immature
prepubescent and irresponsible juvenile delinquent.</TE>
<TE>   Take 14-year-old Aaron Carter. Please. In "Not Too Young, Not Too
Old," the little brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter brags about
being mature enough to cruise for girls, yet childlike enough to
feign innocence when he gets in trouble--all while milking his
Backstreet pedigree for all it's worth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm older now," Aaron raps, urging his young female companions to
"come and show me body." He also asks, "Girl, whatcha gonna do? Come
and talk to me in the back seat--Baby Backstreet!"</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Aaron just wants the girl in the back seat because he knows
that, statistically, children are safer riding there. That's the kind
of thoughtful public-service reminder you'd expect from a real
teenager with a fake beard, "battin' in the majors!"</TE>
<TE>   Another Radio Disney favorite is preteen rapper Lil' Romeo, whose
smash hit, "My Baby," topped the charts last year and is still in
heavy rotation. (Frankly, I had no idea who Lil' Romeo was until my
daughter cleared things up for me. "He's like Lil' Bow Wow," she
explained, "only smaller." )</TE>
<TE>   Lil' Romeo may be small, but that's no obstacle to his sex appeal.
"Eleven years old, makin' A's and B's, and these little mommies can't
keep their hands off me!" he crows. "I'm a little boy but I live a
big man's life.... I got grown women wantin' to be in my life! By the
time I'm 18, I'm not gon' be nothin' nice."</TE>
<TE>   I assume this ditty is part of Radio Disney's campaign to battle
social problems such as pedophilia and the sexualization of children
in the media. The station also deserves kudos for relentlessly
promoting Spears' "I'm Not a Girl ... Not Yet a Woman," which speaks
directly to the age-appropriate concerns of 6-year-olds everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining a wholesome reputation can be tricky with this sort of
subject matter, so Radio Disney often airs edited versions of certain
songs. Snippets of lyrics--including "Am I sexual?" (Backstreet
Boys), "You'll be kissing my ... " (Pink) and the notorious "I'm not
that innocent" (Spears)--have been deleted or altered. Even "Not Too
Young, Not Too Old" was recently tweaked to eliminate references to
girls in the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, censoring an isolated word or two is a meaningless
gesture in the broader context of children's music that's
thematically inappropriate to begin with. This is not music that
celebrates childhood. This is music that feeds a popular culture
intent on hastening childhood's end.</TE>
<TE>   It's certainly a far cry from Mary Poppins, a Disney icon from my
own childhood. In fact, the only thing Radio Disney has in common
with "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" is that the sound of it is
... well, something quite atrocious.</TE>

<HD>Stadium Plan for Downtown L.A.: It's Clearly a Fumble</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long, arduous task of bringing professional football back to Los
Angeles only seems to get more convoluted with each passing day.</LD>
<LD>   In March, the Anschutz Entertainment Group, one of the country's
biggest developers, announced it was in negotiations with the NFL to
build a $400-million, 74,000-seat stadium in downtown Los Angeles
that would one day serve as the home of the city's first NFL team
since the Raiders returned to Oakland in 1995.</LD>
<LD>   A suspicious public wanted to know who would foot the bill. Last
month, Mayor Jim Hahn said taxpayers would be in the clear and that
the developer would cover the entire cost of the project.</LD>
<TE>   Then on Friday, just as the city began to breath a collective sign
of relief and turn its attention back to the Lakers, L.A. Coliseum
officials announced that they would be spending up to $1 million to
develop their own alternate proposal for a football stadium,
infuriating AEG, which claimed it could derail its plan.</TE>
<TE>   What is distressing in all of this, however, is not the bickering
but the total lack of intelligent public discourse over the stadium
proposals from the perspective of urban planning. This is partly by
design. AEG, for example, has refused to disclose the exact location
of the proposed stadium site and has yet to complete a formal design.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has not exactly pressed the company to do so. The assumption
seems to be that all development is good development, that anyone
willing to invest large sums of money in a decrepit downtown
neighborhood should be greeted with heads bowed in appreciation--or
at least get a supportive pat on the back.</TE>
<TE>   Such an attitude toward a pro- ject that would have a significant
effect on the physical shape of downtown would be understandable if a
big development company could be trusted to create an original,
thoughtful alternative to the kind of sports-retail-entertainment
centers that are sprouting all over America. But AEG's proposal is
nothing more than a generic formula--one unlikely to spark the kind
of urban renaissance that its planners have promised.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Los Angeles, meanwhile, has been searching for a new
identity since the mid-1920s, when its importance as a vibrant urban
center first began to fade as the city expanded westward. Its revival
will require the highest levels of planning, and an injection of
bold, new ideas. Anything short is unlikely to turn around an area
known largely for its dilapidated buildings and empty parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium proposal should be understood as part of a much bigger
plan, all of it currently controlled by AEG. The first phase, Staples
Center, was completed in 1999. Last fall, the city approved the
second phase of development, a 40-acre retail, entertainment and
housing complex just to the north of Staples. It would include a
7,000-seat theater, a 1,200-room hotel, several blocks of retail
along Olympic and Figueroa and 800 units of housing. (AEG has yet to
set a date for groundbreaking on this phase of development.)</TE>
<TE>   The football stadium would cover roughly 20 acres just to the east
of the retail complex. And although the developer has refused to
disclose its exact location, most reports place it between 11th and
12th streets around Hope Street. AEG has unveiled a very preliminary
stadium design by the L.A. office of Seattle-based NBBJ Architects.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the thinking behind the plan is relatively clear--and
somewhat predictable. It embodies the kind of "pedestrian-friendly"
planning formula that has become the norm among major developers in
recent years. In a nutshell, the idea is to create instantly the kind
of vibrant street life that exists in older, denser and more
traditional city centers. The tactics are simple enough: Replace
large, monolithic structures with a more varied, small-scaled play of
forms and build lots and lots of retail along the street.</TE>
<TE>   That pattern is already visible in the design of Staples Center,
whose ground level includes offices, a restaurant and shops, which
wrap around its base from Figueroa to 11th Street and are intended to
give the structure a more human scale.</TE>
<TE>   It is the development's second phase--the retail and entertainment
complex--that is meant to provide the glue that will transform the
area into a buzzing urban hub. Anchored by a vast pedestrian plaza,
which faces Staples to the south, the complex would essentially be an
open-air mall. Surrounded by parking structures, stuffed with a mix
of chain restaurants and stores, it recalls recent developments, such
as the Grove at Farmers Market in the Fairfax district of L.A. and
Pasadena's Paseo Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, AEG has vague plans to include even more retail
space along the stadium's base.</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on shops and public space has obvious political
benefits. It gives the public the impression that the developer is
concerned about the kind of quality-of-life issues that have become a
common theme in contemporary politics. And the conventional wisdom is
that such developments are a significant improvement over the kind of
enclosed, air-conditioned malls that became the norm only a few
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   But the impact such a development would have on the surrounding
urban fabric is more dubious. Sports retail-entertainment complexes
are largely introverted, self-contained organisms. As such, they are
unlikely to spur the kind of broad revitalization that the developers
have promised. This is especially true of the football stadium. No
amount of retail shops will disguise what it actually is: an enormous
void that, the developer admits, will remain empty 320-plus days a
year.</TE>
<TE>   There are other options. The most obvious would be to renovate the
existing L.A. Coliseum, a landmark structure at the edge of
Exposition Park. One of the city's oldest historic districts, the
area was originally designed as a series of monuments set around a
formal Beaux Arts park. It includes the 1920s-era Armory
building--currently being transformed into a science school by the
Santa Monica-based architectural firm Morphosis--and the Natural
History Museum, which is in the midst of hiring an architect for a
major expansion.</TE>
<TE>   Renovating the Coliseum stadium would not only bolster such
redevelopment efforts, it would add another element to what is slowly
becoming a more genuinely rich and democratic public forum. It would
also serve to strengthen the identity of an existing community of
mostly lower-middle-class homes.</TE>
<TE>   The more essential problem, however, is not where the stadium
should go, but how such decisions are made. AEG's decision to build
the stadium near Staples has nothing to do with urban planning issues
but with the logic of corporate tie-ins. It is intended to guarantee
that, after paying the price of admission to a football game,
visitors could then wander out and buy a T-shirt and steak dinner at
an AEG retail mall or see a show at the AEG theater.</TE>
<TE>   That experience might be slightly less disturbing if AEG's
proposal were more daring. The robber barons of an earlier age were
often driven by greed. But they were also apt to promote bolder, more
original visions. The original "Miracle Mile," for example, which was
conceived by the realtor A.W. Ross, was an architectural response to
L.A.'s nascent car culture that was radical for its time. In New
York, Rockefeller Center was more than a money-generating office
complex; it became a symbol of capitalism's relentless drive.
Whatever the motive--a sense of civic pride, outright vanity or fear
of death--these developers were driven to reach beyond the average
and the mundane.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far, AEG's plans for downtown have yet to show such ambition.
They are safe, formulaic, somewhat soulless. They embody an age of
corporate gigantism in which decisions are made by committee, and the
only real concern is the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   If these corporations insist on offering up tired old formulas as
the future of our cities, then it is the government's responsibility
to hold them to a higher standard. Hahn could begin by acknowledging
that effective city planning requires more than just spending bails
of money. He could stand up to developers who try to strong-arm the
city into accepting gargantuan urban proposals even before they have
been adequately thought through.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some developers will tell the city to get lost. So
what? No development at all may be a better option than selling off
the city's soul.</TE>

<HD>Leads Bring Uneven Debuts to 'Turandot'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ian DeNolfo, the new Calaf in Puccini's "Turandot" for Los Angeles
Opera, is the kind of singer who will sacrifice his voice for a role.
You see the train wreck coming, you hope it can be averted, and after
it happens, you admire the reckless courage and stamina as the person
picks up the pieces. But it's not a pretty affair.</LD>
<LD>   DeNolfo joined two other new principals--all of them making
company debuts--on Friday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. His vocal
troubles started early, with glorious, stentorian tones alternating
with dangerously off-pitch attacks and upward swooping into notes. By
the time he answered Turandot's final riddle in the second act, he
was growing noticeably hoarse, and his voice began shutting down.</LD>
<LD>   In the third act, he finished "Nessun dorma" without eliciting any
of the push-button bravos that always follow that hit tune. But he
persevered and as long as he was pushing full out managed to recover
some of that earlier ringing tone.</LD>
<TE>   Nina Warren, the new Turandot, was pretty much always pushing full
out, courting stridency and pushing sharp, in her impossible entrance
aria, "In questa reggia," even in those passages that allowed more
subtlety.</TE>
<TE>   Still, her vocal strength never wavered, and her acting, in the
new ending by Luciano Berio, was persuasively conflicted, especially
in contrast with her imperious earlier demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   Svetla Vassileva was the new Liu, bringing rich, dark tone but not
much vocal warmth or finesse to the role. Even so, in her acting, she
made the role a pillar of strength instead of the usual sacrificial
lamb.</TE>
<TE>   Her suicide was consciously calculated, rather than impulsive. It
was an admirable moment.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the cast was previously reviewed. Kent Nagano again
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This cast will repeat Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., L.A. Audrey Stottler, Franco Farina and
Hei-Kyung Hong will sing Turandot, Calaf and Liu, respectively, on
Friday at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. $30 to $155 on weeknights;
$34 to $165 on weekends. (213) 365-3500.</TE>

<HD>Unscripted Angst at Writers Guild Forum</HD>
<DH>Three-day event attracts hundreds of film and TV writers,
many of whom share frustration toward an industry they say is
indifferent to their talent</DH>

<LD>They came equipped with trilling cell phones, nonfat lattes and bulky
bagels. Their freebie tote bags bulged with notebooks, half-written
screenplays and brochures promoting life-changing workshops.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad the Writers Guild Foundation wasn't giving out
complimentary injections of self-confidence.</LD>
<LD>   Insecurities abounded during a three-day forum, which ended Sunday
at the Universal City Hilton, among an estimated 900 film and
television writers--some highly accomplished, others decidedly less
so--eager to conquer the brutal business called Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   The struggles extend even to successful writers such as "West
Wing" creator Aaron Sorkin. Before penning an episode of the
Emmy-winning drama, Sorkin holes up in a room, feasts on Chef
Boyardee and "panics because I don't have anything to write," he said
Sunday before appearing on a high-profile panel with Stephen Gaghan,
Robin Swicord, James L. Brooks, Bo Goldman and David Milch. "I still
have to figure out a season premiere."</TE>
<TE>   At no time has writers' self-confidence been more wobbly in
Hollywood than now, when multinational conglomerates own most studios
and entertainment businesses, and seem more concerned with profits
and safety than creativity and artistic risk, many at the conference
complained.</TE>
<TE>   Sorkin's panel, called "The Writer As Subversive," attracted
hundreds of participants who listened, laughed and nodded in sympathy
as the A-list scriptwriters regaled the audience with Hollywood
horror stories featuring studio executives clueless and cruel about
the emotional energy and labor involved with the craft.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's harder today to do good work," said Goldman, whose
many film credits include "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and
"Scent of a Woman."</TE>
<TE>   But Goldman and others emphasized the importance of setting aside
the anguish and focusing on writing. "You have to continue to do your
work," said Milch, co-creator of ABC's "NYPD Blue."</TE>
<TE>   Often, the "Words Into Pictures" conference--which cost
participants from $220 to $545, depending on discounts and days
attending--resembled a self-help seminar. Some speakers advised
writers to seek therapy and, in Stuart Smalley fashion, to recite
positive affirmations in the mirror. They encouraged writers to
confront their internal bullies, accept struggle as part of the
creative process and reject those who spew negative energy.</TE>
<TE>   One cheerleading moderator ordered audience members in the
brightly lighted, half-packed hotel ballroom to rise from their
seats, flail their arms and chant, "I'm letting go" and "I feel
great."</TE>
<TE>   "Say it even if you have to lie," shouted Paul Ryan, a TV game and
talk show host.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes before Ryan breathlessly began leading Saturday's
90-minute discussion on "Blowing Your Own Horn: The Writer's Image,"
he swung his arms back and forth while smiling at the suddenly
chipper writers mimicking him.</TE>
<TE>   But the positive vibes were short-lived. As in other sessions,
talk, particularly from the audience, plunged quickly into negative
territory. Two commonly heard complaints: Hollywood lavishes love on
actors and directors while sniffing at writers like unpleasant peons;
and Hollywood treats scriptwriters who are over age 40, sometimes
even 30, as unsalvageable hacks, long past their expiration dates.</TE>
<TE>   After the seminar, self-doubt continued to reign over many writers
in the coffee-scented lobby, where mentors had advised them to make
contacts. Some stood in corners, apparently fascinated by nondescript
walls.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Corder paced. Weeks earlier, the 22-year-old graduated
from Pepperdine University with two completed screenplays. "I know I
should make contacts," she said, "but the whole idea of schmoozing is
bizarre."</TE>
<TE>   The discomfort probably won't disappear, even for writers with
Oscars, Emmys and Pulitzers, said Dennis Palumbo, a former
scriptwriter and now a psychotherapist who counsels Hollywood's
creative minds. "All writers struggle," said Palumbo, author of
"Writing From the Inside Out." "All writers have problems. But the
best thing writers can do is write."</TE>

<HD>COLA Fizzes and Fizzles</HD>
<DH>Early look at Tim Miller's 'Us' provokes thought, but Hae
Kyung Lee's 'Silent Flight II' ends up feeling on the thin side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual COLA (City of Los Angeles) performance series began Friday
with new one-act works by performance artist Tim Miller and
contemporary choreographer Hae Kyung Lee on two stages in the Los
Angeles Theatre Center.</LD>
<LD>   In "Us," Miller said goodbye to Los Angeles just a few blocks from
the old Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions site where he made a
major breakthrough in 1984 with "Postwar." Since that LACE debut, he
has co-founded Highways Performance Space, taught for two local
universities, published two books, toured internationally and become
demonized as one of the so-called "NEA 4" who defied the conservatism
of the National Endowment for the Arts in a lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   Like "Postwar," his latest solo vehicle described growing up
scared in America, and the American flag again formed a central
symbol. At one point, in a thoughtful mime sequence, Miller used it
as a hangman's noose but eventually declared that it belongs with
him, wherever he goes, because "I somehow still have hope for us."</LD>
<TE>   His title "Us" referred to the U.S., to the American gay community
and to Miller's eight-year relationship with a young Australian. To
continue in that relationship, Miller is moving to London, for U.S.
immigration laws won't allow his partner to stay here after his
student visa expires later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Using an array of statistics, "Us" attacked the federal government
for allegedly treating gays and lesbians as second-class citizens,
but it also featured endearing reminiscences of Miller's boyhood
fantasies and two radically different self-portraits (one on
videotape). It's always fascinating to see how he redefines himself
as a stage character, and his latest incarnations leaven
truth-telling with sly self-parody.</TE>
<TE>   Since Miller described "Us" as a work in progress, critical
evaluation will wait until a finished version arrives. But Miller's
departure represents a real loss to the community, for he inspires
creativity and activism wherever he goes. L.A. won't be the same--and
neither, most likely, will London.</TE>
<TE>   If Miller emphasized conversational informality, Lee sought a
picturesque, ceremonial stylization in "Silent Flight II," performed
with exemplary control and concentration by her company (now in its
12th season), Hae Kyung Lee and Dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Part 1 found Claudia Lopez, Miguel Olvera, Kishisa Ross and
Sacheen Nehring wearing sarongs the color of unbleached muslin or raw
silk on a stage often virtually obliterated by smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Clustered together while slowly swaying and turning in the manner
of ancient Javanese court ensembles, they eventually began delicately
swirling strips of fabric a la classical Korean sleeve dances, and
then reclined, dragging the fabric along the floor.</TE>
<TE>   A richly textured score by Steve Moshier--performed live by his
seven-member Liquid Skin Ensemble and vocalist Anna Homier--supplied
plenty of atmosphere but no sense of where Lee's picture-perfect
designer ritual might be leading. Neither did the central solo for
James Kelly, all dreamy torso undulations and rippling hands.</TE>
<TE>   But just as the whole piece seemed to be evolving into a throwback
to the style of Ruth St. Denis, early in the last century, when the
Mystic East could be evoked for American audiences through glamorous
poses and billowing incense, all the quasi-spiritual rites ended and
Lee launched her hyperphysical finale. Here Lopez and Olvera climbed
the cloth pillars that had previously served as scenery and used them
to launch trapeze feats.</TE>
<TE>   So it turned out that "Silent Flight II" didn't resemble St. Denis
as much as "Dralion," a Cirque du Soleil production that garnished
displays of gymnastic skills with Asian mysticism--and Asian dance.
Yes, you could choose to interpret the Lopez and Olvera sequence as a
leap of faith, just as you might find a metaphysical interpretation
for the toe-dancers on eggshells in "Dralion."</TE>
<TE>   Hiding a showpiece inside a ritual is always a neat trick because
it inspires just this kind of double-think. Lee knew exactly how much
smoke and spirituality she needed to sell her flash act Friday, but
the result represented strong marketing and thin artistry: diet COLA.</TE>

<HD>Importing Latino Theater</HD>
<DH>Stage* Miami festival shares dramatic works from Brazil and
Spain at the Ford Amphitheatre. The show is also the start of a
three-year initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mario Ernesto was 15, in 1962, he left his native Cuba for the
United States as part of Operation Pedro Pan, which was based on
fears that Fidel Castro intended to ship male Cuban teenagers off to
the Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   The teen's first home in his new country: Helena, Mont. There
weren't many Cubans in Helena. There was a lot of snow. "Talk about
culture shock," recalls Ernesto. "To me, it was like a Hollywood
movie."</LD>
<LD>   He eventually found his way to warmer parts of the United States,
graduating from college in Miami. Twenty years ago, he founded Teatro
Avante in Miami, and in the mid-'80s he was part of the group that
began the International Hispanic Theatre Festival, which Teatro
Avante has administered annually since 1987.</LD>
<TE>   It has attracted a wide variety of theatrical productions, mostly
from foreign companies. Last year, for example, 16 shows from eight
countries were performed in six Florida cities, and a sampler from
the festival was performed in New York.</TE>
<TE>   A branch of the festival will visit Hollywood this month and,
later, Albuquerque. Local performances will take place at the Ford
Amphitheatre in the Cahuenga Pass, Friday through June 20.</TE>
<TE>   Not only will the festival bring a glimpse of international
theater, it also has inspired the launch of the Ford's Latino
Audience Initiative, which was created with a $450,000 grant from the
James Irvine Foundation to the county-owned Ford's private
fund-raising arm, the Ford Theatre Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The project began last year when Laura Zucker, executive director
of the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, noticed a listing in the
New Yorker of the Hispanic Theatre Festival events and asked the Ford
staff to inquire about the possibility of bringing something from the
festival to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry from L.A. was a blessing for the festival, because a
planned 2002 repeat of its 2001 New York extension was canceled in
the wake of fund-raising shortfalls after Sept. 11, Ernesto says. And
he felt it would be a pity to bring foreign troupes to the U.S.
without additional performances outside Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker and Martin Kagan, managing director of the Ford, at first
decided simply to bring two events from the Miami festival for one
year. But as they investigated funding sources, the program evolved
into the three-year Latino Audience Initiative, supported by the
Irvine grant.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the project impressed Ernesto. "I'm always concerned
that we may be token Hispanics. But they're very serious."</TE>
<TE>   Kagan said the Ford has booked some Latino-themed programming and
attracted some Latino audiences in recent years, but not enough in a
county with a population that's more than 40% Latino. The initiative
comes with a full-time program manager, Ralph Flores, and an advisory
committee from local Latino arts groups.</TE>
<TE>   The nationalities of the two international companies that will
launch the Hispanic Theatre Festival at the Ford may initially look
surprising, considering that the majority of L.A. County's Latino
population is Mexican American. The two companies are Pia Fraus
Teatro from Brazil, which will perform Friday through Sunday in
Portuguese with English supertitles, and Compania Marta Carrasco from
Spain, which will perform in Spanish with English supertitles.</TE>
<TE>   Flores says that it might be "a difficult task" to attract Mexican
American audiences to Brazilian and Spanish work, "but that's not to
say that the only thing they want to see is mariachi. They're a
wide-ranging population. Some of them want to see cutting-edge work."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Velasco, who hopes to turn Hollywood's Doolittle Theatre
into a Latino performing arts center for the Ricardo Montalban
Nosotros Foundation, says that in coming years, he hopes to see more
Mexican and Central American groups in the festival. Velasco is on
the festival's advisory committee, but he didn't attend the group's
only meeting so far.</TE>
<TE>   However, another committee member, Ruben Amavizca of Grupo Teatro
de Sinergia, says no one at the meeting has complained about the
nationalities of the groups. "It doesn't bother me that they're
bringing someone from other parts of the world," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There are no Mexicans in the Miami festival this year, Ernesto
says. A Mexican group he tried to import had scheduling conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   Ernesto, Kagan and Flores all say that the choice of groups for
L.A. was dictated by Ernesto's judgment on which groups would fare
best in the Ford, a 1,240-seat outdoor amphitheater. The Florida
venues are smaller and presented indoors. The Ford needed something
big and visually striking, Ernesto says. He says the Spanish and
Brazilian shows meet that requirement.</TE>
<TE>   And he doesn't think a production in Portuguese might deter
members of the Latino Initiative's target audience. "Farsa
Quixotesca" is based on the Don Quixote story, which many in the
audience already know, he says. The Brazilian company's other show,
"Bichos do Brasil," is a nonverbal family-oriented show. Furthermore,
he says, more than 60,000 Brazilians live in the L.A. area.</TE>
<TE>   Is there some particular characteristic that distinguishes
"Hispanic theater"? Laughing, Ernesto replies, "We're very
passionate, we scream a lot, we talk with our hands." But more
seriously, he says his kind of theater is "visual, physical,
metaphorical. It makes you think a little more than the realistic and
text-based theater we're used to in the United States."</TE>

<HD>Mozart Show Is Crossover Hit</HD>
<DH>The annual two-week festival, which offers shows both in
Baja California and the San Diego area, is a delight in any venue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 10 years the Mainly Mozart Festival, begun in San Diego by
British conductor David Atherton in 1989, has been binational. Three
concerts during the two-week event are given at different venues in
Baja California with Mexican sponsorship. On Thursday, the Mainly
Mozart Festival Orchestra became the Sinfonica Festival Binacional de
Mozart, when it appeared in the Catedral de Guadalupe in downtown
Tijuana.</LD>
<LD>   The cathedral, built in 1944 to replace a building destroyed by a
flood of the Tijuana River, is handsome but sparsely decorated. It
stands at a busy intersection amid urban decay. Cars and trucks roar
by. Acoustically, it sounds like a cavern. Two blocks away is the
Avenida Revolucion, where loud dance clubs attract boisterous and
sometimes ugly Americans. A sign advises that "A well-behaved tourist
is a welcome tourist."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mexican audience that filled the church on Thursday
was ideal. Colorfully dressed, gracious, curious, highly sociable and
sophisticated, they seemed like guests at a wedding. Socialites posed
before wandering picture takers. A local television station came to
get some clips for the news. There were a great many families. The
concert was listened to with attention unperturbed by the stifling
heat and street noise. Unlike at the typical American concert, there
were no coughs, no rustling candy wrappers or noisy fiddling with the
program. Cell phones did not ring. A sense of occasion was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   Mainly Mozart is the best-kept Mozartean secret in America. The
orchestra, whether it goes by its English or Spanish name, is a
remarkable ensemble, composed of top players from notable U.S. and
Canadian orchestras. The concertmaster for the first week of the
festival was Martin Chalifour, the Los Angeles Philharmonic's
concertmaster.</TE>
<TE>   Atherton, a former music director of the San Diego Symphony, is
best known as conductor of 20th century music (this spring he
conducted a lavishly praised performance of Benjamin Britten's "A
Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Metropolitan Opera), but he is also
an outstanding Mozart conductor, with a crisp, clean and
enthusiastically dramatic style.</TE>
<TE>   As it happened, the Tijuana concert was minimally, not mainly,
Mozart. The program began and ended with a "Brandenburg" Concerto by
Bach. It contained two seldom-heard pieces by Michael Haydn, the
younger brother of Franz Joseph Haydn and one of Mozart's teachers in
Salzburg. Mozart's contribution was his last two "Epistle" Sonatas,
brief upbeat pieces for string orchestra and organ that the young
composer wrote to be inserted in the liturgical Mass. With no
workable organ at the cathedral, Atherton rearranged the organ part
for harpsichord, which was barely audible.</TE>
<TE>   But never mind. The performances were all engaging. The soulful
solo violists in Bach's Sixth "Brandenburg" were Roland Kato from the
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and Joana Miranda from the Milwaukee
Symphony. There wasn't all that much that Kato and James David
Christie could do given Haydn's Double Concerto for Viola and
Harpsichord personality, but they made it perfectly agreeable.
Atherton did, however, turn Haydn's short Symphony in G Major, P. 8,
into a lively rocket. Bach's "Fifth" Brandenburg was notable for its
animated interplay between Chalifour and flutist Timothy Day. The
fantastical harpsichord solo pretty much vaporized in the hot, still
air, but Atherton maintained, throughout the evening, a sprightly
energy that kept everything else alive.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night, the orchestra resumed it's English name and moved to
Escondido. The change in atmosphere couldn't have been more
different. As in Tijuana, the concert was held two blocks away from a
busy main street clogged with noisy old cars. These, though, were
fetishistic collector's items, part of a rally in tribute to another
age, spewing pollution out of pride, not necessity.</TE>
<TE>   The nearby California Center for the Arts is a modern concert
hall, part of an architecturally bland, well-manicured complex that
includes the City Hall and an art museum.</TE>
<TE>   The audience for Friday's concert was considerably older on
average than that in Tijuana, less stylish and not demonstratively
curious (the art museum offered free admission to ticket holders but,
a half-hour before curtain, I saw only one other visitor at an
interesting special exhibition of Los Angeles video art). Throughout
the concert, there was, as in Tijuana, low-level noise, but it came
from inside, not out (regular throat clearing, candy wrappers
rustling, snores and the constant squeaking one restless man made
with his shoes).</TE>
<TE>   But again, the concert was exceptional. Escondido's hall may be
visually unimaginative, but it is an acoustic treasure, probably the
best-sounding auditorium on the West Coast in which to hear an
orchestra. The orchestra, larger than the ensemble in Mexico, was
polished and crackerjack.</TE>
<TE>   The novelty this time was the West Coast premiere of a bassoon
concert that Rossini might have written. The scholars won't commit,
and it is easy to hear why. The rhythms are pure Rossini. The bassoon
is buffoon, as if it were a comic bass from one of the composer's
comic operas. But missing is the sense of harmonic surprise or the
melodic turns of phrases that made Rossini unpredictable. Still, it
was a lot of fun witnessing Steven Dibner, from the San Francisco
Symphony, puff away at it with comic flair.</TE>
<TE>   The other concerto was Beethoven's second for piano with John Lill
as soloist. Lill had the advantage of solid technique and reliable
musicality but not of personality. For that, Atherton was the saving
grace.</TE>
<TE>   And in two Mozart works--the overture to the early opera, "La
Finta Giardiniera," which is actually a small symphony, and the
better-known early Symphony No. 31 ("Paris")--the conductor was
entirely in his bright, brisk element.</TE>
<TE>   The first movement of the "Paris" is what I will remember the most
from the concert; it burst forth from this strikingly precise and
exhilarating ensemble. But nothing in this performance was a letdown,
and I wonder if there will be a Mozart symphony performance to equal
it at any of the ubiquitous Mozart festivals around the continent
this summer.</TE>

<HD>He's Put Out Over Judging Playwrights by Output</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>D. PAUL THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a delight to see two feature articles about the theater in the
June 2 Sunday Calendar. What a disappointment to read one of
them--"Craftsmen of the Stage," by Steven Oxman.</LD>
<LD>   In all fairness, I am not a fan of this writer. My latest play,
"Serious Inquiries Only," received favorable reviews from everyone
except Oxman, the theater and television critic for Variety. Now with
that admission out of the way, I must confess that I was disturbed by
the patronizing inanity of this article long before I discovered the
personal connection.</LD>
<LD>   Oxman informs us that playwrights are like plants. Some are
"annual" playwrights; others are "perennial" playwrights. The annual
playwright "blossoms beautifully." The perennial "might not bloom as
spectacularly." Domestic perennial playwrights are rare. Home-grown
perennials such as Horton Foote, A.R. Gurney Jr. and Terrence McNally
are "not 'important' playwrights." They are "skilled, intricate
bricklayers." I prefer the "bricklayer" comparison, but soon we're
back in the proverbial garden: The perennial "develops a refined
polish that the flashiest of annual playwrights can't touch."</LD>
<TE>   As I strained to read on, I couldn't help but wonder how Oxman
would classify Eugene O'Neill--a perennial or an annual? Let's see,
he wrote many plays, so that would make him a perennial. Yet he is an
"important" playwright, so that would suggest he was an annual. He
was less prolific toward the end of his life, though some would say
more profound, so perhaps he was a perennial who had metamorphosed
into an annual. Or he may have been an annual all along who
experienced perennial bursts of creativity.</TE>
<TE>   Is all this sounding a bit silly ... and flowery? Of course it is.</TE>
<TE>   This need to categorize the playwright, to qualify and quantify
his or her work based on some botanical measure of fertility, is
irrelevant to the elusive and complicated art of the playwright.</TE>
<TE>   Playwrights are not like plants, unless we're discussing
endangered species. Playwrights are writers who are about the work of
writing plays, and the process and merit of that work defy such
simplistic classifications. Sometimes playwrights are prolific.
Sometimes they are dry. Sometimes they are brilliant. Other times
they are less than brilliant. Sometimes they write a play in a week,
a month--frequently a year or more. They are in fashion, out of
fashion, and the best of them don't give a damn about fashion--their
only imperative is to write--and write they do, often in obscurity.
Is David Hirson a household name to anyone, including Oxman?</TE>
<TE>   History alone will determine the "important" playwrights among us,
not a critic's criterion of whether one is an "annual" or a
"perennial."</TE>

<HD>A Father at 15? No Problem!</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lifetime's two-hour message movie, "Too Young to Be a Dad" (at 9
tonight), is as unsubtle and painfully earnest as an "Afterschool
Special." It's also twice as long, and despite a solid cast that
includes the usually noteworthy Kathy Baker and Bruce Davison, it
feels it, long before the happily-ever-after wrap-up.</LD>
<LD>   Baker and Davison are parents rocked by the revelation that their
15-year-old, straight-arrow, honor-student son Matt (Paul Franklin
Dano, personifying sweet vulnerability), is going to be a father.</LD>
<LD>   Pushed into a first-time sexual encounter that he wasn't ready for
by troubled classmate Francesca (Katie Stuart), Matt sees his
college-bound future derailed when that liaison leads to pregnancy.</LD>
<TE>   Distraught Francesca agrees with her parents' aggressive planning
to give up the baby for adoption, but Matt anguishes over the
decision as he accepts responsibility for the pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   When school policy dictates that both teenagers transfer to an
alternative school, Matt aces all the parenting classes. He gets a
part-time job and sells belongings to help his parents pay for their
share of Francesca's medical bills. His parents' disappointment turns
to pride; his rebel sister is inspired to rethink her own future.</TE>
<TE>   The cautionary messages about teen pregnancy and a father's
responsibility ring true, but the well-meant, rosy conclusion in
Edithe Swensen's teleplay is unintentionally contradictory: Matt
proves so nurturing and mature that fatherhood at 15 doesn't seem too
young after all.</TE>

<HD>Workers at Disney World Hotels Approve Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Striking workers at two hotels on Walt Disney Co.'s Walt Disney World
property approved a contract Sunday that will let many of them go
back to work.</LD>
<LD>   Teamsters Local 385, representing housekeepers, laundry workers,
seamstresses and public area attendants at Walt Disney World's Swan
and Dolphin hotels, declared the strike two weeks ago in one of the
rare labor disputes in Orlando's tourism industry.</LD>
<LD>   The contract covers 400 of the hotels' 2,000 workers. Workers
wanted a guaranteed work week, job assignments based on seniority,
wages to match inflation and no medical insurance cutbacks.</LD>
<TE>   Mike Stapleton, president of the union local, said the approved
contract makes it easier for workers to file a grievance if they
don't get a 40-hour work week and gives workers an extra holiday. "We
made changes that both sides can live with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Treva Marshall, a spokeswoman for the hotels, said the contract
was similar to one workers rejected twice previously with only "a
couple of minor tweaks." She refused to give details on the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Workers had been hired to replace the striking workers, and the
striking workers will be brought back on an "as-needed basis,"
Marshall said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the hotels are on Disney property, they are owned by
Tishman Hotel Corp. and managed by Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts
Worldwide Inc. They account for 2,267 of Orlando's 108,000 hotel
rooms.</TE>

<HD>Growth Likely to Slow in 2nd Quarter, Survey Says</HD>
<DH>Economy: A 2.9% pace is expected, down from 5.6% in the
January- March period. Personal consumption appears to be 'the major
soft spot.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy is expanding this quarter at about half the pace of
the first three months of the year, according to the latest Blue Chip
Economic Indicators survey released today.</LD>
<LD>   Growth from April to June probably will cool to an annual rate of
2.9% from a first-quarter pace of 5.6% that was the fastest in almost
two years, according to this month's consensus forecast of 52
economists. The forecast for the current quarter is down from the
3.1% predicted last month and marks the second consecutive drop in
expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer spending on services, which include everything from
haircuts to health care, slowed in April, the government reported
last month. And in May, Americans bought cars and light trucks at the
slowest pace since November 1998, the Blue Chip report said.</LD>
<TE>   Personal consumption expenditures, which account for two- thirds
of the economy, "look to be the major soft spot," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Such spending probably is increasing at a 2.6% annual pace this
quarter, down from 3.2% in the previous quarter and 6.1% in the last
three months of 2001, the report showed. The pace probably will pick
up, accelerating to 2.8% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth,
according to the survey.</TE>
<TE>   The economy probably will grow 2.8% this year, matching last
month's forecast. GDP will expand at a 3.4% annual pace in the third
quarter, up from a consensus of 3.3% last month, and at 3.7% from
October to December, up from expectations of 3.6% in May. The economy
grew 1.2% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Growth probably will accelerate to 3.6% in 2003, according to the
consensus, up from 3.5% projected last month.</TE>
<TE>   Although consumer spending appears to be cooling, "the outlook for
capital spending is brightening and the recovery in the manufacturing
sector continues to gather strength," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturing expanded in May at the fastest pace in more than two
years, buttressed by increases in new orders and production,
according to figures issued last week by the Institute for Supply
Management.</TE>

<HD>Retail Gasoline Prices Drop</HD>
<DH>Energy: The national average for fuel dips more than 2
cents to $1.40 per gallon in the last three weeks despite increasing
demand with summer travel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. average retail gasoline prices fell over the last three weeks,
as supplies were plentiful despite rising demand with summer
travelers taking to the road, according to a nationwide survey
released Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The national average for self-serve regular gas dropped more than
2 cents to $1.4034 a gallon in the three weeks ended June 7, about 29
cents below the level last year, according to the Lundberg survey of
8,000 gas stations.</LD>
<LD>   Prices at the pump rose rapidly in the early spring as tensions in
the Middle East raised crude oil prices. They have since leveled off
as heavy imports from Europe help to build up a big surplus compared
with last year.</LD>
<TE>   "The biggest factor in the price change over the past three weeks
is lower crude oil prices," Trilby Lundberg, editor of the survey,
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is also no shortage of gasoline to meet demand--there's
more than enough supply. If we had a shortage, the price would rise
even if crude oil prices were falling."</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline prices have spiked in the last two summers because of
increased consumption by vacationing motorists as well as more
stringent clean-air fuel requirements imposed during the summer at a
third of the nation's pumps to combat smog.</TE>
<TE>   Lundberg noted that industrial and agricultural trucking also
rises during the summer, boosting demand for gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   She said she does not believe prices will jump soon.</TE>

<HD>In Sluggish Job Market, Some Fields Still Are Hot</HD>
<DH>Labor: With their skills in high demand, many pharmacy,
accounting, nursing and education graduates have their pick of
offers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KYLE WINGFIELD</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Pete Nguyen has friends graduating with MBAs and PhDs, but they are
struggling to find work in a sluggish job market. His own job search,
though, was hardly a roll of the dice.</LD>
<LD>   Armed with a degree in pharmacy, he had so many job offers that he
and three friends from the University of Michigan pharmacy school
focused mainly on where they wanted to live, settling on Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   "When we were thinking about what city to go to and where to move
to--New York, L.A., Miami, Vegas--basically, whichever city we
decided to move to, we could pretty much be guaranteed a job as a
pharmacist," said Nguyen, a San Diego native who graduated last week.</LD>
<TE>   Pharmacy is among a handful of industries--including nursing,
accounting and education--that are starved for new college graduates
even though most businesses aren't hiring.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Colleges and Employers reports that U.S.
employers are expected to hire 36% fewer new college graduates this
year. Manufacturers are hiring less than half as many grads as in
2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking at a 36% drop in hiring, it's quite an adjustment," said
Camille Luckenbaugh, employment information manager for NACE, a
nonprofit consortium of colleges and employers.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone from people handing out their business cards at spring
break to students beating down the doors and trying to find jobs that
are available," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But graduates in high-demand fields are finding companies
competing for fresh talent.</TE>
<TE>   "Pretty much any time I put a resume in anywhere, they call me in
like a day or day and a half at most," said Traci Pelchat, who
graduates next week from the University of Washington's highly rated
nursing program. "The shortage is so bad right now, pretty much any
place that hires RNs is calling me."</TE>
<TE>   Pelchat said she's considering a handful of positions each
offering upward of $24 an hour--almost $50,000 a year for a 40-hour
workweek--and signing bonuses of about $2,500.</TE>
<TE>   Accountants are still in great demand as well, despite the turmoil
that has plagued that industry over the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   The nine or 10 accounting students at the University of Georgia
who accepted positions with Arthur Andersen had their offers
withdrawn when the firm was indicted on federal charges related to
the Enron Corp. collapse. But most of them have been able to find
work with other companies, university program coordinator Patti Hoyt
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think probably by the end of the summer they'll have something
lined up pretty easily," Hoyt said.</TE>
<TE>   School officials have not surveyed all accounting graduates from
this spring, but Hoyt said the placement rate should be close to last
year's, when only one graduate out of 60 didn't have a job within a
few months.</TE>
<TE>   Average starting salaries are up slightly to $45,000 to $46,000
this year from $43,500 last year, Hoyt said.</TE>
<TE>   A common explanation for the abundance of jobs in high-demand
fields is the time required to earn a degree in one of them. Many
undergraduate accounting students go on to earn master's degrees, and
pharmacy school often takes at least six years.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the biggest deterrents why people don't want to go into
pharmacy is the B.S. is five years, while the PharMD is another year.
And that other year makes a big difference," said Jin Yun, from
Saginaw, Mich., another of the Las Vegas-bound pharmacists.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Yun said, with all that schooling behind him--nine years
in his case--it's time to face the problems and challenges of the
real world.</TE>
<TE>   "I just gotta control the gambling urge," Yun said. "That's
probably going to be my biggest problem."</TE>

<HD>PR Firms Are Making a Pitch for Latino Market</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of ignoring the Latino market, the nation's top public
relations agencies are creating focused practices and urging
corporate clients to carve out bigger marketing budgets for the
sector.</LD>
<LD>   Burson-Marsteller is the latest giant to join top agencies such as
Weber Shandwick, Fleishman-Hillard Inc., Hill &amp; Knowlton Inc.,
Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, Ketchum and Golin/Harris
International in creating Latino market practices to generate more
money from the more than 35 million Latinos in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   To a degree, they are horning in on a field occupied for years by
smaller Latino public relations, marketing and advertising agencies.</LD>
<TE>   "Certain big PR agencies are hiring one or two [employees with]
Hispanic surnames, and then they say, 'We can do Hispanic PR,' " said
Benito Martinez, president of Los Angeles-based Acento Advertising
Inc., which specializes in Hispanic marketing and public relations.
"Our approach is different. We reflect our culture and issues in a
way the big firms would never understand."</TE>
<TE>   But global public relations firms said they understand the culture
and have the broader reach corporations are looking for.</TE>
<TE>   Burson-Marsteller announced in April a national Latino effort that
pulls some 20 employees and other resources from 10 U.S. offices.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the company's practice has secured accounts such
as Miller Brewing Co., Gatorade and Lincoln Mercury. Some clients
already were with the firm, and others joined just to reach the
Latino market, said Elena Stern, director of public affairs for
Burson-Marsteller's U.S. Latino practice.</TE>
<TE>   Miller hired Burson-Marsteller three months ago to increase the
visibility of its Miller Lite and Miller Genuine Draft products among
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a growing market. Any company that is not paying attention
to the Hispanic market is overlooking a huge opportunity," said
Miller spokesman Ron Acosta. "With the surge in population and
purchasing power, any company should be asking, 'Where do my products
fit in?' "</TE>
<TE>   Burson-Marsteller joins several other large public relations firms
investing in the Latino market. Weber Shandwick Worldwide has had a
public relations team focusing on the Latino market since late 1999,
said Armando Azarloza, director of Weber Shandwick/Latin.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the landscape, and most [Latino specialty] companies
were very regional. They had local resources to serve their accounts,
and we knew we could do it on a national level," Azarloza said.</TE>
<TE>   Weber Shandwick's Latino practice has grown to 11 continuing
clients, plus smaller project accounts, that combined will produce
more than $1 million in revenue in 2002, Azarloza said. The Latino
team coordinated a Spanish-language national media relations campaign
to help introduce M&amp;M's Dulce de Leche candies and put together an
event for Jaguar's new X series with salsa music star Celia Cruz in
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Manuel Valencia, partner of the Latino-owned public
relations firm Valencia, Perez &amp; Echeveste Inc., said his firm is not
worried about the competition.</TE>
<TE>   "They're outstanding agencies, but in the Latino market, when we
go up against the Hispanic division of a general market firm, our
track record shows that 70% of the time, we win," said Valencia,
whose Pasadena-based firm's clients include McDonald's Corp., AT&amp;T
Corp. and Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   The toughest competition for Latino agencies still comes from
corporate resistance to fully acknowledging the power of the Latino
market, Valencia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. of Hispanic Advertising Agencies released a report last
month indicating that nearly two-thirds of top U.S. companies
targeting Latino consumers have invested less than 3.2% of their
overall advertising budgets in that market over the last three years.
The percentage in the public relations field is at or below that
figure, said Ingrid Otero-Smart, president of the advertising
association.</TE>
<TE>   But public relations specialists said that is changing.</TE>
<TE>   At Fleishman-Hillard, corporate interest in Latino consumers has
grown rapidly in the last two years, said Rissig Licha, executive
vice president and managing director of Fleishman-Hillard in Miami,
the branch that houses the firm's national Latino practice. The
practice handles Procter &amp; Gamble Co. products such as Tide, Pampers
and Pledge.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the large firms fold their Latino market operations
into multicultural practices. Hill &amp; Knowlton began its ethnic market
operations in 1987, when Los Angeles clients asked for public
relations services with local Spanish media outlets, said Raul Garza,
the company's director of diversity communications.</TE>
<TE>   "That grew into Hispanic marketing and Hispanic advertising,"
Garza said.</TE>
<TE>   Latino-geared public relations agencies also are broadening their
offerings to capture more marketing-budget dollars.</TE>
<TE>   With public events, sponsorships, media relations and marketing
communications, public relations no longer means just corporate
spokespeople, said Esther Novak of Ketchum's multicultural practice,
known as Ketchum Vanguard.</TE>
<TE>   Fiesta Broadway drew nearly 250,000 Latinos to downtown Los
Angeles on April 28, and marketers are increasingly choosing to
promote their companies at such events because of the human
interaction.</TE>
<TE>   Events offer a face-to-face encounter with companies and their
products, and they usually include interaction with the Latino
leaders the community knows and trusts, Novak said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to create something culturally relevant to the local
Hispanic community," agreed Heidi Eusebio, senior account supervisor
for Edelman Diversity Solutions in New York. "That cultural profile
is the key, like having a Cuban spokesperson in Miami or a Mexican in
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Edelman created a large soccer program in Los Angeles as the basis
of a public relations campaign that markets the allergy medication
Claritin to Latinos, who suffer from outdoor allergies more than
other ethnic groups, Eusebio said.</TE>
<TE>   Eusebio acknowledged she may have to fight to keep the account as
competition grows from other large public relations agencies.</TE>
<TE>   But she said competition only makes the agencies better and
ultimately leads to the dream of all public relations firms: "higher
PR budgets."</TE>

<HD>TV News Viewership Stabilizes</HD>
<DH>Poll: A third of the public watches evening network
broadcasts, about the same as two years ago. Percentage of newspaper
readers falls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of people who watch network evening news on the three
major broadcast networks stabilized over the last two years, says a
poll that suggests increased news interest after Sept. 11 is at least
partially responsible.</LD>
<LD>   Despite that higher interest, the number of people who said they
had read a newspaper the previous day declined to 41%, down from 47%
in 2000, according to the poll by the Pew Research Center for the
People and the Press.</LD>
<LD>   Online news consumption grew only slightly during that period--a
sharp contrast from the rapid growth of the late 1990s. The number
who said they go online at least three times a week for news was 1 in
4. That was not significantly higher than two years ago and may
reflect the slower growth of Internet access.</LD>
<TE>   About a third of the public, or 32%, said they regularly watch the
evening news on ABC, CBS or NBC, the survey showed, roughly the same
percentage as in 2000. Twice that many said a decade ago that they
regularly watched the evening network news.</TE>
<TE>   The news audience that regularly gets its news from cable stations
remained about the same as network news, or 1 in 3, according to the
poll.</TE>
<TE>   "Increased interest in national news, and even some additional
interest in international news, has helped stem the steady loss of
network news viewers over the last decade," said Andrew Kohut,
director of the Pew Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   The number of people who said they follow national news closely
most of the time increased slightly, to 53% from 48%. The number who
followed overseas developments very closely most of the time also was
up slightly.</TE>
<TE>   "The poll suggests a kind of remarkable durability to evening
news," said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in
Journalism. "When you think that 30 million people still watch the
evening news at a time when fewer and fewer Americans are really
home, it's kind of a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Newspapers have been particularly hard hit by changing news
habits. Only a quarter of those younger than 30 said they had read a
paper the previous day.</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, much of the decline in newspaper readership
has come in the 35-49 age group. "These people are not growing up to
be loyal newspaper readers or network news viewers," Kohut said.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper readership among those 60 and older has been relatively
steady over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between younger and older Americans is particularly
noticeable in the viewership of television news, and especially
network news broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what they watched the previous day, people 65 or older were
nearly twice as likely as those younger than 30 to say they had seen
news on television.</TE>
<TE>   The poll of 3,002 adults was taken from April 26 to May 12 and had
an error margin of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</TE>

<HD>State's Workers Making Progress</HD>
<DH>Labor: Most of the lowest-paid Californians have improved
their fortunes over the long term, a study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Income inequality is growing faster in California than in the nation
as a whole. But research tracking the long-term progress of
individual California workers shows that even those on the bottom of
the economic ladder are moving up over time.</LD>
<LD>   Examining the earnings of more than 180,000 Californians from 1988
to 2000, researchers headed by the Sphere Institute, a nonpartisan
Bay Area think tank, found that the median annual earnings of the
sample group rose 24% after adjusting for inflation. Gains were
greatest for the lowest-paid workers, who saw their median annual
earnings more than double over the 12-year period.</LD>
<LD>   Though the research showed a sizable chunk of Californians mired
at the bottom of the pay scale, most were able to improve their lot
through some combination of experience, enhanced skills, better
education or migration to better-paying industries.</LD>
<TE>   "There are opportunities out there and people are taking advantage
of them," said Michael Dardia, vice president of the Sphere
Institute, which will be releasing the study this week. "No question,
some people are stuck.... But California has a dynamic labor market,
and people are moving up."</TE>
<TE>   The findings illustrate how different income inequality can look
depending on how you slice the figures. A number of studies have
shown that the gap between the rich and poor in California has
widened over the last two decades. This is due in part to tremendous
gains made by professionals in sectors such as technology coupled
with a huge influx of poorly educated immigrants into low-paying
jobs. A 1999 study by the Public Policy Institute of California found
that real wages for the state's lowest-earning male workers fell by
about 40% between 1969 and 1997, while those in the top echelon rose
13%.</TE>
<TE>   Such so-called cross sectional studies provide useful snapshots of
overall work force earnings at particular points. What they don't
capture is how specific individuals fare over the long haul and
whether those at the bottom are doomed to stay there.</TE>
<TE>   To get a better sense of whether workers earning the lowest wages
in the late 1980s made any progress over time, Dardia and a team of
researchers used payroll data from the state Employment Development
Department to track the individual earnings performance of 187,000
randomly selected Californians across the earnings spectrum from 1988
to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Over that 12-year span, median annual earnings for the group rose
by nearly 24% to slightly more than $49,000, while the lowest-wage
workers saw their take double to $27,000. That compares with a 7%
decline in real earnings for the entire California work force over
the same period.</TE>
<TE>   What that indicates, according to Dardia, is that the Californians
who were earning the least in 1988 aren't the same people at the
bottom today. As individual workers gain experience and move up the
economic ladder, their places on the lower rungs are being filled by
younger, less skilled, increasingly immigrant workers. The result is
that though California's overall income distribution continues to
look grim and intractable, individuals themselves are experiencing
fairly strong earnings mobility.</TE>
<TE>   "Just looking at [overall] income distribution, you'd think things
weren't so hot," Dardia said. "But if you follow individuals over
time, you find out that they aren't doing so badly."</TE>
<TE>   Comparing the sample against the entire California work force,
Dardia found that more than 80% of workers in the bottom earnings
quintile were able to move to a higher quintile over the 12-year
period. Comparing the sample workers against each other, more than
half of those in the bottom quintile moved up by 2000. These findings
are consistent with national research that has likewise found
substantial earnings mobility for individual workers over time.</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the gains reflect the natural tendency of earnings
to increase due to age, experience or general economic growth, the
report's authors also found that workers improved their fortunes by
switching industries. Earnings growth was higher for those leaving
jobs in low-paid sectors such as retailing and agriculture. Only in
durable-goods manufacturing did workers leaving the industry make
smaller wage gains than those who stayed.</TE>
<TE>   Dardia said his research underscores the resourcefulness of
California's workers in finding paths to upward mobility. But he said
that doesn't mean the state should simply ignore its growing income
inequality and burgeoning ranks of the working poor. Though the
majority of those at the bottom end of the pay scale appear to
advance over time, a good number don't. Likewise, some of the biggest
gains in the study came from workers who simply moved from part-time
employment to full-time jobs, which resulted in dramatic increases in
their overall earnings but not necessarily their wage rates.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bernick, head of the state Economic Development
Department, whose researchers contributed to the report, said the
state needs to continue targeting skills training and education at
workers having difficulty making the leap to better-paying jobs. He
said the study shows the long-term benefits of staying in the work
force and hopes it will help dispel the notion that entry-level
employment is a waste of time.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting work experience and building a job record does have
value," Bernick said. "This suggests that a lot of so-called dead-end
jobs can lead somewhere."</TE>

<LD>The world's biggest annual biotechnology conference opens this week
in Toronto, providing a forum for boosters as well as detractors of
an industry where stock prices have been hammered by regulatory
setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   The sector has had a tough year in terms of financial performance.
The American Stock Exchange biotech index closed Friday at 361.90, a
44% drop from where it stood 12 months earlier.</LD>
<LD>   This year, more than 12,000 representatives from health care,
agricultural, industrial and environmental biotechnology are expected
to attend the convention.</LD>
<TE>   The conference will feature several symposiums, including a
session today addressing ways to smooth the Food and Drug
Administration drug approval process. Topics such as when a company
should give up on an experimental drug and whether drug development
costs are justified will be the focus of other discussions.</TE>

<LD>U.S. economic data will be scant this week.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Wall Street will scrutinize the U.S. producer price
index for May for signs of whether inflation is a problem. Friday,
preliminary statistics on consumer sentiment from the University of
Michigan will signal whether the American public is continuing to
feel comfortable about spending.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve's "beige book," an anecdotal report on
regional and national economic conditions, also is expected this
week.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Commerce Department will report on retail sales
probably falling slightly in May, and a report Friday on business
inventories is expected to show a 0.2% decline in April from a 2
1/2-year low in March.</TE>
<TE>   Despite indications of an improving economy, widespread mistrust
of corporate management, fears of more violence in the Middle East
and sluggish corporate profit growth will probably continue to
conspire to drive stocks.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic data does not seem to be driving this market," Tim
Ghriskey, a fund manager for Ghriskey Capital Partners, said. Wall
Street "is more focused on the issues in Pakistan, India, Iraq and
the Middle East in general, and potential terrorism on U.S. soil.
Without something to distract investors from this, it will continue
to overhang the market."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Elan Corp., a Dublin-based drug maker whose shares have declined 88%
in the last year, plans to exit from businesses and cut its locations
by half in response to investor pressure, the Sunday Times reported,
citing Chairman and Chief Executive Donal Geaney.</LD>
<LD>   Elan today will say it plans to focus on two of its five product
areas, neurology and pain killers, and quit acute care, cancer
treatment and dermatology, the newspaper said. It will pare locations
to 16 from 32, and unwind many of its 55 research joint ventures, the
Times said.</LD>
<LD>   "Investors told us that they want a simpler, clearer structure,"
Geaney told the paper. "Our plans are not as big as they were a year
ago, but this is a much harsher environment for everyone."</LD>
<TE>   Geaney didn't return calls seeking comment on the report.</TE>
<TE>   Elan, already facing declining profit and an accounting probe by
U.S. regulators, is selling some investments to help pay about $3
billion in debt, analyst David Maris of Credit Suisse First Boston
said last week. Elan said Thursday it has enough cash to finance
operations and meet obligations.</TE>

<LD>Juors deliberating the fate of Arthur Andersen on charges of
obstruction of justice will resume this morning in Houston after
meeting over the weekend without reaching a verdict.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-man, three-woman jury, which is being sequestered, has
been deliberating since Thursday. They met on Saturday and on Sunday
at the federal courthouse.</LD>
<LD>   At one point Sunday they asked for a dictionary. U.S. District
Judge Melinda Harmon denied the request, telling jurors that if they
needed a word defined, she and attorneys would do so for them.</LD>
<TE>   Today will be the start of the sixth week of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is accused of shredding documents and deleting computer
records related to Enron Corp. audits in October and November last
year as the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an
investigation into the energy-trading company's complicated
accounting practices.</TE>

<HD>ImClone's New CEO to Face Lawmakers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harlan Waksal, tapped three weeks ago to take the reins from his
brother at struggling biotech ImClone Systems Inc., faces a week of
grilling from shareholders and lawmakers about whether company
executives defrauded investors while enriching themselves and those
close to them.</LD>
<LD>   Tuesday, shareholders at the company's annual meeting are likely
to take Waksal to task about ImClone's failure to alert them to
potential delays in getting its experimental cancer drug, Erbitux,
approved by regulators.</LD>
<LD>   Two days later, Waksal is set to appear before a congressional
panel that hopes to find out whether ImClone misled shareholders and
if top executives profited from illegal trading.</LD>
<TE>   Waksal was ImClone's chief operating officer until three weeks
ago, when his brother Samuel resigned from the top job amid renewed
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan agreed to cooperate with the congressional committee, but
Samuel is resisting. It is unclear whether Samuel will testify at the
hearing. Legal experts say he probably will take the 5th Amendment
against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Samuel said the ex-CEO and his lawyer still are
evaluating whether he will testify and respond to congressional
questions at the hearing. A spokesman for Harlan said the ImClone
chief will appear at both meetings.</TE>
<TE>   In the 48 hours leading up to the company's announcement Dec. 28
that the Food and Drug Administration had refused to review Erbitux,
citing flaws in the drug's clinical trials, five members of Samuel's
family, as well as former girlfriend and style guru Martha Stewart,
sold stock in ImClone.</TE>

<HD>Coffee Organization to Push Diversification</HD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The International Coffee Organization will present a plan to the
World Bank and Interamerican Development Bank this week to help
coffee growers diversify, the group's top executive said.</LD>
<LD>   ICO Executive Director Nestor Osorio said he will present a
specific diversification program to the banks, which, if approved,
will need only the signature of coffee authorities in producing
nations to be set in motion.</LD>
<LD>   Osorio said producers need to generate alternate forms of income
if they are to survive crises like the one that saw prices sink to
historic lows last October during a continued global coffee surplus.</LD>
<TE>   The idea of diversifying coffee farms was a hot topic in the 1970s
when another supply glut was depressing the global coffee market,
Nestor said. But, he added, the issue was swept onto the back burner
in the middle of discussions after a frost in Brazil, the world's top
producer, wiped out much of the surplus and prices rebounded.</TE>

<HD>PwC to Be Dubbed Monday</HD>
<DH>Consulting: The unit is changing its name to separate
itself from Pricewaterhouse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>PricewaterhouseCoopers said its consulting business will adopt the
name Monday in place of the current PwC Consulting as part of a
$110-million marketing effort to create a brand that's distinct from
the auditing firm.</LD>
<LD>   The name change will occur once the unit is spun off in an initial
public offering, planned for August, spokeswoman Sehra Eusufzai said.
PwC Consulting announced in March that it would change its name.</LD>
<LD>   The name Monday is "a real word, concise, recognizable," said Greg
Brenneman, chief executive of PwC Consulting.</LD>
<TE>   Pricewaterhouse and rival auditors are separating their consulting
units to eliminate perceived conflicts of interest after the collapse
of Enron Corp. Investors and lawmakers have charged that Arthur
Andersen was lax in overseeing Enron's books because Andersen didn't
want to jeopardize consulting fees.</TE>
<TE>   The $110-million marketing budget includes funds for advertising
and fees paid to Wolff Olins, the brand consultant that developed and
tested the name, Eusufzai said. While the firm asked partners and
other employees for name ideas, they were rejected in favor of
Monday, which Wolff Olins chose.</TE>

<DH>Games: The firm has staged a turnaround by creating
must-have titles that are in high demand by ex-rivals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sonic the Hedgehog is back.</LD>
<LD>   After pulling the plug on its money-draining Dreamcast console
last year, video game company Sega Corp. has rebounded with an
operating profit and a lineup of must-have titles that are turning
former rivals Sony Corp., Nintendo Co. and Microsoft Corp. into
suitors.</LD>
<LD>   Though it's too early to declare Sega a financial success,
analysts said Sega has transformed itself from a struggling
hardware-focused company to one of the industry's most important
software companies.</LD>
<TE>   "They're one of the best comeback stories of the year," said P.J.
McNealy, senior analyst for technology consulting firm Gartner Inc.
"They were able to pare off under-performing units and really
reposition themselves as a significant software player in less than
18 months."</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere was Sega's transformation more evident than at last
month's Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, the industry's biggest
trade show. At an after-hours event at Sega's relatively modest
booth, key executives from Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony buried
hatchets and paid homage. Gamers lined up to get autographs from Sega
developers, who passed out baseball cards instead of business cards
as Sega games ran on Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and
Nintendo's GameCube.</TE>
<TE>   No one mentioned the Dreamcast, least of all Sega executives, who
were painfully aware that the company poured more than $1 billion
into the console before discontinuing it in March 2001. The
experience left Sega with $1.5 billion in debt, nearly the same
amount as its annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to quit the hardware business after 15 years left
fans and investors with a bad taste. Many predicted that the company
would become irrelevant. Takeover rumors swirled, with reports that
Nintendo or Microsoft would purchase Sega. With Sega's future
clouded, speculation was rampant that the company's developers would
bolt. But Sega managed to hang on to most of its independence and
most of its key talent.</TE>
<TE>   The developers did not disappoint. In the first three months of
this year, Sega was the No. 1 independent publisher for GameCube,
selling 22% of the games for that console. It also was the No. 3
publisher for PlayStation 2 in the same period with 7% of all games
sold, boosted by strong sales of "Virtua Fighter 4" and "NBA2K2."
Last year, Sega's "Jet Set Radio Future" and "Super Monkey Ball"
bolstered the lineup of games at the launch of Xbox and GameCube.</TE>
<TE>   At E3 this year, Sega's games continued to garner buzz.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a fantastic lineup," said Geoff Keighley, a writer for
Gamespot, an online game site. "Sega is without a doubt one of the
most important third-party publishers for these consoles. You have
'Shinobi' on PS2. On Xbox, there's 'Panzer Dragoon,' based on their
classic franchise. And 'Sonic' is on GameCube. For gamers, these
franchises are huge."</TE>
<TE>   Sega's ability to recover lies in these franchises, which the
company has aggressively milked for revenue this last year. An
example of this strategy is "Sonic Adventure 2 Battle" for GameCube.
The game--essentially identical to "Sonic Adventure 2" for the
Dreamcast--sold 280,000 copies for the GameCube. Much of the revenue
was gravy since the title required only minor changes in the
Dreamcast version.</TE>
<TE>   "That's revenue we would not have otherwise seen," said Peter
Moore, president of Sega of America, the parent company's U.S. arm.
"We've been unleashed from the Dreamcast."</TE>
<TE>   Console makers, eager to get their hands on Sega's games, will be
in the position of helping their former foe by giving Sega extra
marketing and development dollars if it agrees to put games
exclusively on their consoles.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, bringing a character like Sonic to the GameCube was very
important to Nintendo," said George Harrison, senior vice president
of marketing for Nintendo.</TE>
<TE>   Financially, Sega is not out of the woods. Though the company saw
a $111.5-million operating profit for its fiscal year ended March 31,
a $258.3-million loss from stock market investments resulted in an
overall $140-million net loss.</TE>
<TE>   "When there have been profits or losses in the past at Sega, they
have been large," said Mark Cerny, president of Cerny Games in Los
Angeles and a former Sega developer. "It's easy to make or lose $50
million in this business. The trick is going to be consistency and
making the profits year in and year out."</TE>
<TE>   Never short on confidence, Sega declared at E3 that the company
aims to become North America's second-largest game publisher after
Electronic Arts Inc. by the end of the year. For its last fiscal
year, Sega's North American revenue was $201 million, compared with
EA's $952 million, Activision Inc.'s $308 million, and THQ Inc.'s
$280 million.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Sega achieved its goal, the company still would be a
distant second to EA, which is expected to top $1.2 billion in sales
in North America this year, according to estimates from UBS Warburg.
To catch up, Sega is shopping for studios and publishers.</TE>
<TE>   "Sega will pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy to further
reinforce its video game console publishing business," said Charles
Bellfield, Sega's vice president of strategic planning.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Sega saw 26.6% of its revenue from North America, 10%
in Europe and 61.6% from Japan, much of it from its arcade business.
But with Japan's economic doldrums and a weak arcade market, Sega is
looking to the U.S. for growth and profit.</TE>
<TE>   Sega's success or failure ultimately rests on continuing to crank
out killer games.</TE>
<TE>   "If they keep bringing the same quality of software they have in
the past," Harrison said, "they will easily be one of the top five
publishers in our industry for some time to come."</TE>

services to Europeans with high-speed Internet accounts.</LD>
<LD>   The company struck a deal last week with Freedomland, an Italian
company that specializes in interactive television and online
entertainment. Freedomland agreed to put more than $14 million into
the joint venture and acquired a minority stake in Intertainer for
about $9.4 million.</LD>
<LD>   For its part, Intertainer agreed to make its video-on-demand
technology available to the joint venture and to help acquire
content. The new service plans to offer a mix of programming from the
U.S. and Europe.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp., the leading maker of digital cameras, is making a major
push to grab the U.S. market for do-it-yourself retail machines that
help users instantly print snapshots taken with their digital
cameras, moving into a space dominated by Eastman Kodak Co.</LD>
<LD>   Sony said that since it began shipping its PictureStation
photo-finishing system to retailers two months ago, it has installed
100 of the devices, which range from an $8,000 countertop model to an
$11,000 kiosk that's 5 feet tall. Over the next three years, Sony
expects to set up about 20,000 units in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   To get their pictures, users can insert the memory card from their
cameras, adjust and select desired photos, pay and print their shots.</LD>
<TE>   Sony initially is banking on independent photo retailers to become
the first stop for consumers won over by the convenience and advanced
features of digital cameras but still uncomfortable with printing
their shots at home on a personal computer.</TE>
<TE>   Kodak dominates the U.S. market for kiosks, with more than 21,000
Picture Maker machines.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Universal Music Group has struck its most sweeping deal ever with an
independent online music company, letting Dallas-based Streamwaves
offer thousands of songs on demand for a flat fee.</LD>
<LD>   It's the first time the world's largest record company, a
subsidiary of Vivendi Universal, has licensed its entire catalog for
a subscription music service that it doesn't own. Universal also has
made its songs available to subscribers of Pressplay, an online music
venture it co-owns with Sony Music.</LD>
<LD>   The slow pace of licensing by some record firms has drawn scrutiny
from the Justice Department, which has launched an antitrust
investigation. Analysts also have criticized the labels for failing
to provide a legitimate alternative to the unauthorized services that
let consumers copy songs free.</LD>
<TE>   Streamwaves, which also has licenses from EMI Recorded Music and
top music publishers, offers unlimited access to an online jukebox
for $17 a month. Unlike Pressplay, however, Streamwaves doesn't let
subscribers download songs or record them onto CDs.</TE>
<TE>   Other online jukebox services include Listen.com's Rhapsody, which
has licenses from every major record company but Universal.</TE>

<LD>A year ago, investors were losing faith in Palm Inc. The once-

system--a crucial weapon in its battle to remain dominant in the
competitive hand-held market.</LD>
<LD>   Palm OS 5, analysts say, is a much-needed major upgrade from the
pioneer of personal digital assistants' earlier operating systems.</LD>
<TE>   The big leap is that OS 5 runs on more powerful ARM
microprocessors, which rival what is used by Microsoft Pocket PC
devices. The OS 5 platform is designed to be faster and more secure,
and can accommodate richer audio and graphics. The new operating
system also expands built-in support for wireless networking.</TE>

<HD>Trying a Different Approach to A.I.</HD>
<DH>Computers: Cyc is adding information to its database from
the public's knowledge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN BERGSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Day after day since 1984, teams of programmers, linguists,
theologians, mathematicians and philosophers have plugged away at a
$60-million project they hope will transform human existence:
teaching a computer common sense.</LD>
<LD>   They have been feeding a database named Cyc 1.4 million truths and
generalities about daily life so it can automatically make
assumptions humans make: Creatures that die stay dead. Dogs have
spines. Scaling a cliff requires intense physical effort.</LD>
<LD>   Though some critics question the potential of this painstaking
effort, the inventors believe that Cyc will form the brains of
computers with supercharged reasoning abilities--which could help us
work more efficiently, make us understand one another better and even
help us predict the previously unforeseeable.</LD>
<TE>   Cyc (pronounced "psych") already has helped Lycos generate more
relevant results on its Internet search engine. The military, which
has invested $25 million in Cyc, is testing it as an intelligence
tool in the war against terrorism. Companies use Cyc to unify
disparate databases and are examining a new application that warns
when computer networks have vulnerabilities hackers can exploit.</TE>
<TE>   This spring, the developers' company, Cycorp Inc., sent their
creation off for some higher education, creating a Web link to let
the public download Cyc's knowledge base and teach it things too.</TE>
<TE>   Cycorp's founder and president, Doug Lenat, believes that if
enough people log in to share the world's collective wisdom, Cyc will
become vastly more useful.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Cyc is just a few hundred megabytes that can be stored on
a single CD. Someday, Lenat envisions its becoming standard equipment
in computers or being placed on a network server to fuel dozens of
applications. It could annotate e-mails to put them in better context
for their recipients, serve as an instant language translator and
even offer humans advice from varying points of view.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most exciting time we've ever seen with the project.
We stand on the threshold of success," Lenat, 51, said recently in
Cycorp's offices in a quiet Austin, Texas, complex. "What people are
able to do on a day-by-day basis could be dramatically increased if
we are successful."</TE>
<TE>   Such hopes are not new in artificial intelligence, which has
produced more disappointment than marvel.</TE>
<TE>   As early as the 1940s, researchers envisioned computers that could
hold vast amounts of knowledge, learn from experience and reason for
themselves. The fantasy was most famously depicted by HAL, the
computer that operates a spaceship but turns murderous in "2001: A
Space Odyssey."</TE>
<TE>   Though early artificial intelligence showed promise, it was of
limited use beyond specific tasks. One 1970s program helped doctors
diagnose kinds of meningitis by asking for details about a patient's
condition. But the program also would determine that a burned-out car
had meningitis, because it could not know that was ridiculous.</TE>

<HD>Small Digital Camera Fills the Bill for Her</HD>
<DH>Photography: Nikon's Coolpix 2500 has a memory card that
lets it store 16 pictures at top resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMY BALDWIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My home shows how your average Gen-X techie lives. There's a new Dell
computer with high-speed cable Internet connection and CD burner. The
entertainment system is crowned by a DVD player. I have a cell phone
and a Palm hand-held. Next up: a digital camera.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, I am not a techie. My boyfriend selected and set up our
computer. He's burned CDs; I haven't. I rarely remember to carry my
cell phone, and I'm ashamed to say that my Palm, which came with the
computer purchased early this year, languishes unopened in its box.
So I decided to try out a digital camera before buying one.</LD>
<LD>   I began with the Nikon Coolpix 2500, which is being marketed to
the young and trendy and offers 2-megapixel top resolution.</LD>
<TE>   The Coolpix 2500 passed my first test: It is as easy to use as a
simple 35-millimeter point-and-shoot.</TE>
<TE>   Setting up the camera--plugging in a rechargeable lithium battery
and inserting a flash memory card--was a snap. Reviewing images on
the liquid crystal display screen and deleting unwanted pictures
proved uncomplicated as well.</TE>
<TE>   The camera also allows users to take video--a whopping 15 seconds'
worth on the 16-megabyte memory card that ships with the camera. But
I didn't bother with this somewhat useless feature.</TE>
<TE>   Along with offering all the ease of a standard point-and-shoot
camera, the sleek, silver-and-blue Coolpix 2500 has a unique
advantage: Just rotate the camera's inner swivel lens toward yourself
and you can take your own picture. That feature came in handy on a
hiking trip when my boyfriend and I didn't want to break our fellow
hikers' stride to snap our photo.</TE>
<TE>   The Coolpix 2500 also met my other criteria: size and price. About
the size of a minicassette recorder and weighing about 10 ounces with
the battery, it fit easily in my purse as well as the pocket of my
hiking shorts. With a price tag of $350, chances are non-techie users
like me won't suffer as much buyer's remorse as they might by
purchasing a more expensive model, with features they don't need.</TE>
<TE>   Still, I had some minor issues with the Coolpix 2500. There is a
long time lag between snapping and processing photos. And it was
difficult to compose pictures in darker settings because the camera's
LCD screen also serves as the viewfinder. I might have gotten around
that by using the camera's manual features or its night setting
option.</TE>
<TE>   Transferring pictures directly to the computer via Universal
Serial Bus connection, without having to remove the flash memory
card, was easy. The Nikon View 5 image management software, which is
included, worked fine, but the prompts for how to e-mail photos
weren't exactly intuitive.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, this camera has about what I need and little more. Though
its top resolution of 2 million pixels is less than half the quality
of cameras geared toward professionals and demanding hobbyists, it's
plenty sufficient for producing crisp snapshots, which is what I'm
after.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't matter to me that I would be unable to blow up pictures
larger than an 8-by-10, and that even at that size the resolution
might suffer.</TE>
<TE>   The Coolpix 2500 makes up for that with a 3X optical lens,
comparable to 37-millimeter to 111-millimeter, and a 4X digital zoom.</TE>
<TE>   The rechargeable lithium battery gives you about 60 minutes'
operating time. Though the 16-MB memory card stores only 16 photos at
top resolution, the camera will accommodate cards with much more
room.</TE>
<TE>   I'd consider purchasing the Coolpix 2500, after trying out another
digital camera or two. This camera does offer a personal selling
point: My boyfriend was impressed to come home to find I'd
transferred photos to our computer without his help. I haven't told
him how easy it was.</TE>

<HD>Racing's Online Bet</HD>
<DH>The chairman of the state horse racing board worries that
online wagering will lead to the sport's demise</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If horse racing is indeed the sport of kings, everyone in California
who has a home computer now lives in a castle.</LD>
<LD>   Internet betting on horse races became legal for California adults
in January. All types of track bets--including exacta, pick 6 and
daily double, as well as the traditional win, place and show--can be
placed online. The races also can be watched live on streaming video.</LD>
<LD>   Bets are placed and paid off through credit card accounts.</LD>
<TE>   As chairman of the California Horse Racing Board, veteran TV and
film producer Alan Landsburg has overseen the leap of the sport into
the digital world. A longtime horse owner, he was appointed to the
board by Gov. Gray Davis in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Landsburg, 69, whose TV credits include the "Undersea World of
Jacques Cousteau," "That's Incredible" and "In Search Of..." series,
did not willingly jump on the bandwagon. He was one of two board
commissioners to vote against the granting of Internet betting
licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What were your reservations about the move onto the
Internet?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I was not sure we were ready to take such an important
step. If it goes wrong and we end up lessening the on-site audience
for racing, it could threaten the very existence of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   We are already facing difficult times. Over the last 15 years or
so, there has been a definite graying of the audience, and no one has
figured out yet how to get around this. Millions have been spent on
all kinds of surveys and marketing. But on Sunday [June 2]--a
perfectly pleasant day to be out at the track--the attendance at
Hollywood Park was about 9,000. In the old days, that might have been
30,000 or 35,000.</TE>
<TE>   We don't want to cannibalize that number further by having some of
those people who came out just go onto the Internet. We have to do
this carefully.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What's the difference? The track and the horse owners still get
a cut, and it might increase the amount bet.</TE>
<TE>   A: Then you are in danger of eliminating the audience completely
and running the race in what is essentially a television studio with
the sound of hoofs and a simulated audience roaring as background.
That would be terrible.</TE>
<TE>   Q: With your long history in production, you would be the man for
the job.</TE>
<TE>   A: I would definitely not come out of retirement for that.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with sitting at home, alone, and making a bet is that
when you win there is no one to poke in the ribs and say, "I did it!"
Don't go thinking that is not the most important part of being at the
racetrack. It is a social thing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Could Internet betting boost interest in the sport and thus
track attendance?</TE>
<TE>   A: That is the hope. And I think it could work if we go after two
extremely important classes of potential customers: the lapsed bettor
and the new bettor. It should be a carefully conceived campaign by
hard-nosed marketers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where do you find a new audience for the sport?</TE>
<TE>   A: If we are to have a future, we will have to start to pay
attention to the 15-and-younger crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Q: But they can't bet.</TE>
<TE>   A: If you ask most people my age how they got involved in horse
racing, they will tell you, "My dad took me" or "We used to go as a
family." This is not something that you just get interested in all of
a sudden. Horse racing is more complicated than the stock market--no
one should go into it casually.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are the upsides of betting online for the serious bettor,
besides not having to get dressed and go to the track?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is so much information available for quick reference by
computer. It should be like the fantasy sports leagues that got such
a boost from being online.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What is it going to take to re-energize horse racing if online
betting does not work out?</TE>
<TE>   A: Wagering is the lifeblood, but it's not enough anymore. Vegas
realized that and they overcame it with gaudy shows. You have to try
and make it more entertaining. If you just rely on wagering, horse
racing will go the way of the street craps game.</TE>
<TE>   We have to find a way to give people another reason to come out to
the track for a fun afternoon. Racetracks, themselves, have done
little or nothing about this because they can't see beyond today's $2
wager.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Does online wagering provide a dangerous opportunity for
problem gamblers?</TE>
<TE>   A: The number of people addicted to gambling and involved in horse
racing is a lot smaller than those who go to Vegas and go bust on
emotional betting. But to the addict, gambling in any form is a lure.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the regulations set by the board, no one is allowed to
make more than one deposit, per day, into the account they use for
racing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: There is no limit on how much they can deposit, however.</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, but they can't go higher than their credit card limit.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you made online bets?</TE>
<TE>   A: Just three times to try it out.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Was it fun?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not really. I didn't have any trouble because I have been using
computers for 15 years and I know my way around the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   But for me, simply making a bet is not what it's about. I have to
see the whole panorama of the race--I want to see the horses walk by
on parade, warm up and get into the gate. I want to see if they are
showing pride or fear, how their legs look, their ankles.</TE>
<TE>   You can't really see all that on a computer screen.</TE>

<HD>Trade Via L.A. to Rise Modestly This Year</HD>
<DH>Economy: Most of the growth is expected to be in imports
because of strong spending by U.S. consumers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>International trade moving through the Los Angeles area is expected
to increase by a modest 3.6% to $220.2 billion in 2002, reflecting a
sluggish economic recovery, according to a forecast being released
today by the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.</LD>
<LD>   That's still well below the record $230 billion in 2000, but it
would be an improvement over last year, when a slowing economy and
the Sept. 11 tragedy saw two-way trade slide 7.6%. The Los Angeles
Customs District includes the ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles and
Port Hueneme as well as Los Angeles International Airport, Ontario
International Airport and McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the growth will be in imports, projected to increase 4.2%
to $149.4 billion, reflecting continued strong spending by U.S.
consumers. But weak foreign economies and a relatively strong dollar
continue to bedevil U.S. exports, which are expected to grow only
2.5% to $70.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The big wild card this year is the possibility of a West Coast
dockworkers strike that could shut down the ports of Los Angeles,
Long Beach, Oakland and Portland, Ore. Tensions are running high
between the International Longshore and Warehouse Union and the
Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shippers and cargo
distributors. The longshore workers' contract expires June 30.</TE>
<TE>   A strike would hit hard in Southern California, which employs more
than 400,000 workers in international trade. But the effects would be
felt nationwide. Estimates of damage to the U.S. economy range from
$1 billion to $2 billion a day if there were to be a halt in the flow
of goods through Los Angeles-Long Beach, the nation's largest port
complex. Such an event would be a blow to an economy just beginning
to recover, said Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing couldn't be worse," Kyser said.</TE>
<TE>   Japan remained the L.A. area's top trading partner in 2001, with a
total of $45.6 billion in merchandise moving back and forth through
the region's seaports and airports.</TE>
<TE>   But China was a close second at $44.9 billion and is expected to
move into the top spot this year. China already is the largest source
of imports moving through the Los Angeles Customs District at $39.3
billion last year.</TE>

<HD>TriStar in Talks to Buy Kirch Assets</HD>
<DH>TV: The studio would join with WAZ Gruppe and Commerzbank
in acquiring entertainment unit, a source says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sony Corp.'s Columbia TriStar is planning a joint bid with Germany's
third-largest bank and a German publisher for KirchMedia, the main
entertainment unit of the insolvent German media giant Kirch Group, a
source with knowledge of the talks said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   German bank Commerzbank and WAZ Gruppe, a newspaper group said to
be close to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Socialist
Democrats, were in talks with Columbia TriStar to acquire the
KirchMedia assets, said the source, who would not comment on
financial terms or how control of the assets would be divided.</LD>
<LD>   Reuters reported that the two German parties each are interested
in 40% of the company and Columbia TriStar would acquire the
remaining 20%.</LD>
<TE>   Kirch Group is trying to find buyers for the businesses of
KirchMedia as well as its other entertainment unit, KirchPayTV.
Prospective bidders have until the end of the week to express
interest in all or part of KirchMedia, the film unit whose main asset
is a 52.5% stake in Germany's biggest free-television broadcaster,
ProSiebenSat.1 Media.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction involving Sony, if completed, would give the
Culver City-based studio a stronger presence in Europe's largest
television market and ensure air time for TriStar programs such as
"Jeopardy," "Dawson's Creek" and reruns of "Seinfeld." TriStar
already provides KirchMedia's broadcasting unit with its Friday night
lineup of comedy programming.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed consortium, which would have German companies
controlling the majority of the concern, probably would blunt
political opposition over the involvement of a foreign media company.</TE>
<TE>   ProSiebenSat.1 controls about a third of the German television
market in terms of viewership. KirchMedia also has an extensive film
library as well as broadcast rights to popular sports, including
soccer, and a money-losing sports channel. The company transferred
this year's World Cup soccer rights to a Kirch Swiss subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   ProSiebenSat.1 has a current market value of about $950 million.</TE>
<TE>   KirchMedia was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in April
after it failed to win the backing of existing investors, including
Rupert Murdoch. Kirch's bankruptcy lawyers have said KirchMedia needs
about $940 million to reorganize and hold on to the main film and
television business. The proceedings were triggered in part when
Kirch missed a $132-million payment to Columbia TriStar for
programming.</TE>
<TE>   KirchMedia is reported to have $1.7 billion in liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many stumbling blocks potential investors face, like,
for example, the valuation of film rights," Lorne Campbell, head of
equity research at CAI Chevreux in Frankfurt, told Bloomberg News.
"You just don't know what you're getting into with KirchMedia."</TE>
<TE>   Kirch representatives were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   KirchMedia's reorganization plan includes selling units, cutting
prices for film contracts with Hollywood studios and focusing on
broadcasting and film and sports rights. The company hasn't said how
much money it lost last year.</TE>
<TE>   If the KirchMedia deal with Sony's TriStar is accepted, WAZ Gruppe
probably would manage the operations.</TE>
<TE>   The management board of Commerzbank, one of KirchMedia's major
creditors, is expected to vote on the proposal this week. Though the
new chief executive of KirchMedia, Wolfgang van Betteray, has had
talks with Commerzbank, Columbia TriStar and WAZ Gruppe, the
consortium was not granted exclusivity, and other offers may be
considered.</TE>
<TE>   KirchMedia managers hired UBS Warburg to auction off the company's
assets. UBS Warburg sent more than 60 interested companies a 40-page
description of KirchMedia's more than two dozen divisions. Other
large U.S. companies, including AOL Time Warner Inc., have been
rumored to be interested.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters, quoting bank sources, said there was no other serious
bidding consortium for KirchMedia.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, KirchMedia minority shareholders, which together
control about 20% of the company, have been separately trying to
piece together a refinancing plan to prevent a breakup of the
company's holdings. Minority shareholders include Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset.</TE>
<TE>   Kirch Group, whose other main business is KirchPayTV, also filed
for bankruptcy protection this year. The holding company has more
than 70 subsidiaries and debt of about $5.7 billion. Germany's
second-biggest media company is disintegrating after about $4 billion
worth of acquisitions by founder Leo Kirch, 75, led to ballooning
debt and mounting losses.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi to Sell Unit to News Corp.</HD>
<DH>Media: Deal will cut debt for Messier. Murdoch to merge
Stream with Telepiu as Italy's only pay-TV operator, with 2.35
million subscribers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. agreed to buy an Italian television
business from Vivendi Universal for $700 million in cash, plus debt,
to become Italy's only pay-TV operator.</LD>
<LD>   The price includes $700 million of assumed debt and $700 million
in cash, said Jean-Louis Erneux, a spokesman for Canal Plus,
Vivendi's pay-television unit. Vivendi expects the transaction will
cut its debt by about $1 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier is under pressure to
sell assets to cut $30 billion of debt after he spent $100 billion
turning a water utility into the world's second-biggest media
company.</LD>
<TE>   Murdoch will merge Telepiu with his Stream unit, almost tripling
News Corp.'s Italian subscribers to 2.35 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything that cuts Vivendi's debt and increases its cash flow
is good news," said Jacques Falzon, an analyst at KBC Securities in
Paris, before the announcement. He rates Vivendi shares "buy."</TE>
<TE>   Telepiu, which has 1.5 million subscribers, has been losing money
since it was created in 1997 by Canal Plus, Europe's biggest pay-TV
company. The unit accounted for most of Canal Plus' $350-million loss
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Stream has been losing money because of the rising cost of buying
sports and movie broadcasting rights. Analysts say Italy's high
piracy rate is hurting both companies. Stream has 850,000 clients.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the purchase, News Corp. will pay $465 million to
reimburse Italian Serie A soccer rights as well as broadcasting
licenses, News Corp. spokeswoman Alison Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of Telepiu puts an end to about a year of talks--and
disputes--between Messier and Murdoch over who will control the
Italian pay-television market. It also marks a reversal for Vivendi's
strategy to expand in Europe after losses at Canal Plus mounted.</TE>
<TE>   "The sale of Telepiu, which accounts for only 10% of our
subscribers in Europe, is a first demonstration of our willingness to
bring Canal Plus back on track for profit and growth and focus on the
most promising markets," Messier said in a release. Three weeks ago,
Messier dropped a plan to buy Stream from News Corp. and merge it
with Telepiu.</TE>
<TE>   Italian regulatory authorities must approve the agreement. Both
companies said they would drop lawsuits filed against each other once
the purchase is completed. No timetable was given.</TE>
<TE>   Murdoch and Messier have been vying for control of Europe's pay-TV
market since 1998. Tension between News Corp. and Vivendi increased
when Messier started building a stake in BSkyB in 1999 without first
consulting Murdoch. That ended discussions to merge BSkyB with Canal
Plus. Last month, Vivendi completed the sale of its stake in BSkyB.</TE>
<TE>   Canal Plus in March filed a $1-billion piracy suit against News
Corp.'s NDS Group, accusing it of pilfering its "smart card"
technology, which enables viewers to access pay-per-view digital
television programs in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Messier dropped a plan to buy Stream the day after Vivendi got
clearance to do so from Italian authorities, saying the regulators
had imposed new conditions on the purchase. Murdoch objected and said
he wouldn't let Messier walk away from the agreement.</TE>

<HD>HMOs Stalk Patients' Rights</HD>
<DH>The industry must not be allowed to wiggle its way out of
accountability to the ailing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE COURT</AU>
<BD>Jamie Court is executive director of the Santa
Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. E-mail:
Jamie@consumerwatchdog.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California HMOs are slyly attacking the new patients' rights laws
touted by Gov. Gray Davis as the toughest in the nation. The industry
can't be allowed to undermine the two pillars of HMO patients' rights
it has targeted: effective state regulation and legal accountability.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest assault, Kaiser Permanente convinced an
administrative law judge to rule that the state's HMO regulator could
not intervene in most patients' quality of care problems.</LD>
<LD>   The dangerous reasoning grew out of Kaiser's aggressive legal
opposition to a $1.1-million fine levied against it after three
patients with ruptured abdominal aortal aneurysms died after their
access to treatment was blocked by Kaiser's unresponsive telephone
call system or its over-capacity emergency rooms.</LD>
<TE>   Newly uncovered internal documents have proven the systemic nature
of Kaiser's problems, although these were not introduced as evidence
in the case. In a program Kaiser claims to have ended, the company's
telephone clerks who handled patient calls were paid financial
bonuses to limit doctor appointments, to not transfer calls to nurses
and to hang up quickly. For its part, Kaiser has contended that its
patients' quality of care is its doctors' problem, not the HMO's.</TE>
<TE>   The state medical board, which regulates doctors, says it has no
authority to address systemic quality of care and access to care
problems at HMOs or in doctor-run medical groups; the board leaves
those problems to the HMO regulator, the Department of Managed Health
Care.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser now is seeking to turn this crack in the law--the lack of
regulation of doctor-run medical groups--into a gaping loophole.</TE>
<TE>   For the largest HMO in the nation to hide behind its doctors, who
work only for Kaiser, is like an auto manufacturer claiming it is not
responsible for the design of its exploding gas tanks because its
workers built them.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the Department of Managed Health Care rejected the
administrative law judge's decision, saying, "California's reforms
are a beacon to the nation and we will not turn back the clock."
Department Director Daniel Zingale also urged Kaiser to reconsider
its "legal strategy of arguing that limitations on patient protection
laws render this case unenforceable."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Kaiser can decide whether to pursue its case in state
Superior Court, where a similar ruling could undermine the authority
of the agency created in 2000 specifically to enforce the California
HMO reform package.</TE>
<TE>   Kaiser and other HMOs supported much of this reform legislation to
quell a public backlash at the time; now they must begin to live
within those laws rather than continually try to obstruct them.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Kaiser's litigiousness over the company's rights
contrasts starkly with HMOs' evisceration of the legal rights
extended to their patients in 1999. The mandatory binding arbitration
agreements HMOs have forced their patients into as a condition of
enrolling have become a means of disemboweling the HMOs' legal
accountability to the individual.</TE>
<TE>   Until the state's "right to sue" law, most patients could not
recover damages when HMOs harmed them. Effective in 2001, the
liability law gave all patients that right when their HMO interfered
with the quality of their care but did not specify in what forum.
Currently, there is no public record of any patient using the law.
Forced arbitration has prevented cases from coming before judges,
which keeps case law beneficial to patients from developing.</TE>
<TE>   Without such precedents to determine the scope of HMOs' liability,
the industry is evading accountability on yet another front.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators must focus their attention on the efforts by HMOs to
weaken the state's patients' bill of rights--even the sneak attacks.</TE>

<AU>PETER DREIER and SARAH POPE</AU>
<BD>Peter Dreier, a professor of politics at Occidental
College, is the coauthor of "Place Matters: Metropolitics for the
21st Century" (University Press of Kansas, 2001). Sarah Pope is a
researcher at the Center for Food and Justice at Occidental.</BD>

<LD>Some families lose their homes when they lose their jobs, others get
evicted when landlords raise rents, and some are bulldozed out of
their homes to make way for sports complexes and convention centers.</LD>
<LD>   Now a new study reveals that almost 100,000 families across the
nation--more than 9,000 in the Los Angeles metropolitan area--have
lost their homes in part because of unscrupulous lenders, appraisers
and private real estate agents who are not properly overseen by the
Federal Housing Administration. Many other homeowners are at risk of
losing their homes.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, an FHA program created to help working families
purchase affordable homes often ends up being the means to evict
them.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles has more FHA properties facing imminent foreclosure
than any other urban area in the country, according to a study by the
Chicago-based National Training and Information Center. This is
particularly a problem in minority and lower-income neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The epicenter for this national problem is a census tract in
South-Central Los Angeles, where 40% of all families with FHA-insured
loans are either at risk of losing their homes or have already lost
them.</TE>
<TE>   The FHA works like an insurance company for banks and mortgage
companies--if a family with an FHA-insured loan falls too far behind
in its mortgage payments, the federal government comes to the
lender's rescue.</TE>
<TE>   Some lenders will not make mortgages in inner-city neighborhoods
unless they are no-risk, FHA-insured loans.</TE>
<TE>   The downside is that too many lenders make bad loans, often using
unscrupulous practices, such as falsifying a family's financial
records and selling homes at inflated prices. In the last 34 years,
the FHA has spent billions of dollars bailing lenders out.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the FBI uncovered one ring of FHA fraud in Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties involving 30
real estate agents and mortgage brokers. Many families lost their
homes. This $10-million scam, which is just the tip of the iceberg,
reveals a clear double-standard in a program that is supposed to help
lower-income people become homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   It was the FHA that, after World War II, helped turn the U.S. into
a nation of homeowners. From the 1940s through the 1960s, the FHA
played a major role in enabling working families to purchase homes in
booming suburbs--including the San Fernando Valley--by allowing
lenders to make low-interest, low down-payment loans.</TE>
<TE>   During that period, however, FHA loans promoted racial segregation
by approving mortgages only to whites in the suburbs and primarily to
minorities in the central city. FHA thus exacerbated "white flight"
from the cities.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Congress told the FHA to help minority, working-class
families buy homes in urban neighborhoods where banks had
historically discriminated against them. But for many of these
families, much-vaunted home ownership has turned into a nightmare
because the FHA has become a passive player rather than an active
regulator.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, lenders are allowed to approve mortgages on
homes that may require substantial repairs, unbeknownst to the buyer.
Also, because the FHA insures the entire amount of the loan, lenders
have no incentive to work out a payment plan to keep families in
their homes. In addition, the FHA too often looks the other way while
private real estate firms that it hires harass families and violate
tenant rights laws to get them out.</TE>
<TE>   Change is clearly needed. Congress must require the FHA to do
better at monitoring lenders, appraisers and real estate brokers and,
once the agency has identified where abuse is prevalent, punish those
who participate in these practices by removing them from the program.
As consumer groups such as the National Training and Information
Center and ACORN, a national anti-poverty group, have suggested, the
FHA must also work with homeowners--particularly those who have been
subject to abuse by lenders--to help them stay in their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, where foreclosure is unavoidable, the FHA should work
with community-based organizations and local governments to ensure
that vacant buildings are quickly turned into affordable housing
opportunities rather than be allowed to contribute to blight and
neighborhood decay.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a program like this existed until recently in L.A., where
the Enterprise Foundation was working with several nonprofit
community organizations to repair more than 1,700 FHA-foreclosed
homes and sell them to qualified working families. The Bush
administration, which pulled the plug on this program a few months
ago, should reinstate this program.</TE>
<TE>   In short, the federal government must help rather than hinder
homeownership in minority and low-income areas, and Congress must
make sure the FHA lives up to this mission.</TE>

<HD>Don't Freeze Us Out on Drilling</HD>
<DH>We Alaskans resent outsiders telling us what to do with our
land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARL FRANCIS</AU>
<BD>Karl Francis, an advisor to the city council of
Kaktovik, Alaska, on environmental, oil and gas issues, is a former
professor of northern affairs at the University of Toronto.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was reminded the last time I drove the Alaska Highway that
Fairbanks is a long way from Los Angeles, about 4,000 miles. But that
is hardly an excuse for the recent spate of articles, editorials and
letters about Alaska and its people in the debate over drilling for
oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</LD>
<LD>   The good people of Alaska have been portrayed as pawns of the oil
industry, bought off by dividend checks that are somehow profane. To
the contrary, those checks from the Alaska Permanent Fund are one of
the Alaska Legislature's wisest and most socially responsible acts.
By paying every Alaskan a modest return on the investment of oil
revenue that belongs to them, the state has ensured the long-term
interest of these people.</LD>
<LD>   No other oil province, nation or state has been so successful in
protecting its future. Rather than an incentive for more drilling,
this fund protects the investments already made from oil already
found.</LD>
<TE>   In a sense, the dividends are progressive taxes. They return money
to every Alaskan--man, woman and child--in equal amounts. A family of
eight gets twice as much as a family of four. In rural Alaska, that
makes a big difference to what President Kennedy's domestic poverty
program chief Sargent Shriver once described as the "poorest place in
America." Life is much better now. People are not rich, but they are
surviving and making progress toward decent lives.</TE>
<TE>   For those in the other 49 states who think they love and know best
how to manage Alaska, I would ask this: Where were you last winter? I
was on the Arctic coast with my friends and neighbors. We were there
because it is home. It is the source of all meaning and beauty, the
very core of who we are. We don't make our living someplace else and
then vacation here for one week in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   In order to live there, I once managed a huge environmental
research program for a consortium of companies that proposed to build
a 48-inch gas line from Prudhoe Bay, 6,000 miles across Canada to
both coasts of the contiguous United States. Mostly we studied the
creatures of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Our investigators
were some of the finest scientists in North America, including people
we borrowed from state and federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   We planned to have little or no impact on caribou or anything
else. The federal environmental impact statement said as much, as did
the federal administrative law judge who reviewed it. We planned to
bury the refrigerated line in permafrost in the winter. By spring we
would be gone. By the end of the summer the surface would have fully
re-vegetated, with our help.</TE>
<TE>   As important, we planned to clean up much of the mess left by
various federal projects. Once done, the land would have been nearly
as pristine as some proclaim it now to be.</TE>
<TE>   There is much more. Alaska's North Slope is a big place with much
history. It has a people, the Inupiat, the native people of this
place. It is their homeland we are talking about in the drilling
debate. They just want their rights and their homeland respected.</TE>
<TE>   Ask them what they think about all this, about what is best for
them, for their homeland, for the caribou and for their people. There
is a terrific story in this if someone would look for it and not just
parrot romantic but ill-begotten rubbish written by people who want
to make this land into something it has not been--at least not for
many thousands of years--a wilderness. People who live here, work
here and live off the land are offended by the notion that their home
is a wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   The North Slope of Alaska is full of people, as full as it can be.
To call it wilderness is the height of arrogance and disrespect for
the people whose homeland it has been for millenniums.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the United States Catholic Bishops Conference starts today in
Dallas, many of us lay Catholics will be figuratively standing
outside, ready to nail a few demands on the conference door.</LD>
<LD>   What do we want?</LD>
<LD>   Anything that will bust down the doors of the good-old-boy Roman
Catholic hierarchy. Married priests. Women priests. Women bishops.
And of course, the abolition of mandated celibacy.</LD>
<TE>   We want a new theology of sexuality, one that does not shame
Catholics with puritanical teachings that inevitably lead to a
stunted sexual development among our pastors.</TE>
<TE>   We want priests who have to do what most employed adults need to
do: Get in the employment line. Fill out the application. Apply for
the pastoral position. Be responsible in order to keep their jobs.
Take the evaluations. Pay their bills.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: We want our church to grow up.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what we don't want: Our gay brethren blamed for the
pedophilia rampant in the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   As the bishops gather in Dallas, they should keep in mind the mood
of the Catholic community. They should keep in mind stories like
mine.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, as an undergraduate college student, I entered the Roman
Catholic seminary, the academic and theological training ground for
priests. There I witnessed the best and worst of priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   My fond memories are of scholarly work, learning biblical
exegesis, the study of the history of Christianity.</TE>
<TE>   But as a seminarian, I also had access to a world that I had never
seen among the laity, a world where supposedly celibate men (how many
kept that vow?) had secrets, ones never shared with the congregation.</TE>
<TE>   In the seminary, something happened to me and to a few other
students that, at the time, seemed anecdotal, an anomaly in a world
of holy men.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the incident becomes another report in a thickening file.</TE>
<TE>   This priest liked his sex partners young. Most were younger than
me. I was 19, "legal" in the eyes of the law.</TE>
<TE>   I should have seen the warning signs: the teen pornography stacked
in the closet of his rectory apartment, the strange videos, the
alcohol that he kept offering me.</TE>
<TE>   Correction: I did see the signs; but he was a priest. His
spiritual rank had more power than my deductive logic.</TE>
<TE>   After telling me about his affair with a 15-year-old at a local
high school, and telling me how he sent the teenager off to juvenile
detention for threatening to tell the authorities, the priest asked
if I wanted to take a shower with him. Finally, an alarm went off. I
declined.</TE>
<TE>   I learned later that he had pulled this same ploy with some of my
classmates.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after this incident, I decided not to be a priest. But before
I left the seminary, I and some others reported the priest who had
approached us.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of handing him over to a civil authority, however, our
bishop took it upon himself to deal with the problem by moving him to
another part of the diocese.</TE>
<TE>   My story is not unique. And as more people talk about what once
happened to them or to their loved ones, we question more deeply that
which was once unquestionable: the hierarchy.</TE>
<TE>   These days a Catholic looks twice at the collection basket,
wondering if her weekly check written to her local parish for the
last two decades has gone to fill the hush-money line item of the
ecclesial budget.</TE>
<TE>   What would happen if she held back a percentage? Just part of it,
maybe 25%. That might cover the amount that has gone to buy silence
from decades of sex-abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   How would that influence the theological conversations held in
Dallas this week?</TE>
<TE>   With so many men defrocked and hauled to jail, the priests who
have done nothing wrong stand before us on Sundays, wondering how to
talk to a suspicious congregation. It's a rough time. A really rough
time to be Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   Thank God, at least for those of us who want the church to change.</TE>
<TE>   What will happen in Dallas? Will it be the beginning of
fundamental policy changes? Will something radical occur? Or will
this Catholic nightmare be too much for us? Will we lay people get
quiet again and turn away from the media, which will then turn to
another story?</TE>
<TE>   Many don't want that to happen. Some laity and clergy see this as
the beginning of a Catholic civil rights movement. It's time, once
again, to stand at the door and nail up some demands.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gang violence is of life and death importance, but is it worth $9
million a gangbanger to stop? Gov. Gray Davis seems to think so,
since when he revised his budget in May he protected his pet project,
a boot-camp type school in San Luis Obispo that for its first six
months enrolled a single cadet--dubbed the $9-million kid for the
state dollars spent to open the academy.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, Davis seems not to care much about gang violence. His
budget, after all, kept intact money earmarked for police--that's
imperative--but axed the matching amount for prevention.</LD>
<LD>   This, despite growing evidence that the most effective way to
combat gangs is to hammer their criminal activity while trying to
head it off by offering a societal lifeline to the children most
vulnerable to the thug life's allure.</LD>
<TE>   Think of gang violence as a cancer ravaging neighborhoods. Police
and prosecutors are the surgeons and oncologists. Researchers have
yet to find a magic cure. But they know something about how to
prevent the disease. In 2000, the Legislature passed the
Schiff-Cardenas Crime Prevention Act, allocating an extra $121
million for police and sheriffs to hire officers and buy equipment.
It included an equal amount for mental health counselors,
school-based probation officers, mentors and job-training programs.</TE>
<TE>   It is the juvenile-justice equivalent of a campaign to urge people
to quit smoking, get mammograms, eat vegetables and exercise. And
Davis, in essence, has said that he wants to keep open the state's
hospitals and morgues but sacrifice checkups, flu shots and other
preventive care.</TE>
<TE>   California's deficit is huge and requires huge cuts. Davis'
stubborn allegiance to the boot-camp boondoggle--only two dozen
bad-boy cadets have completed the program since it opened last year,
bringing the cost per student to about $500,000--isn't good
economics. Besides, studies show that yell-and-drill programs don't
deter crime.</TE>
<TE>   Too bad the governor didn't attend a conference on crime last week
in Sacramento, where he would have heard researchers from around the
country talk about ways to evaluate gang programs to make sure they
actually work--to quantify results by something other than the
twinkle in a child's eye, and to measure how much that twinkle cost
and how many crimes it prevented.</TE>
<TE>   By jointly sponsoring the conference, state Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer and Health and Human Services Secretary Grantland Johnson
showed that they understood the philosophy behind the Crime
Prevention Act, which the Legislature had the good sense to pass.
Lawmakers are already working to return the balance in how the money
is spent, knowing that this proven approach succeeds only because it
links law enforcement with effective community-based social services.</TE>
<TE>   If Davis is serious about stopping gang violence--and doing it
economically--he'll invest in what works.</TE>

<HD>'Organic' Marketing Ploy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The organic food industry has gone mainstream, with revenue to match.
Sales were more than $4 billion nationally in 2000, up from $173
million in 1980. Fertilizing the boom is consumers' understandable
eagerness to steer clear of the chemicals that are sprayed and dusted
in increasing amounts on conventionally grown crops. In 1998, more
than 50 million pounds of fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and
soil fumigants were applied to California farm fields--3 million
pounds more than in 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Federal regulators, trying to bring some discipline to what
"organic" means, proposed the first national standards for defining
organic fruits, vegetables and meat in 1997. They are slated to go
into effect this fall.</LD>
<LD>   Now, before the system has even had a chance to work, Agriculture
Secretary Ann M. Veneman is considering weakening the federal
standards in a way that could reduce the term "organic" to marketing
hooey.</LD>
<TE>   Supported by a powerful delegation of Southern members of
Congress, Baldwin, Ga.-based Fieldale Farms Corp. has asked Veneman
to allow it and other companies to label their livestock organic,
even if the animals eat nonorganic feeds and are thus exposed to a
variety of chemicals in their diet.</TE>
<TE>   Fieldale claims there isn't enough organic feed produced in the
U.S. to feed the 300,000 organic chickens it wants to turn out each
week. That claim is hokum. As organic farm owners and large grain
companies recently pointed out, there is more than enough
pesticide-free grain available to meet Fieldale's and other
companies' demands--just not at a price Fieldale wants to pay, since
organic corn and soybeans cost two or three times more than
conventionally produced grains.</TE>
<TE>   Even if it were true that Fieldale couldn't secure enough feed to
expand production, the only honest course would be to cancel the
expansion, not make a mockery of the term "organic."</TE>
<TE>   If Veneman grants the waiver for livestock, it would affect not
just meat but eggs, milk and butter, as well as packaged products
that contain dried versions of these foods.</TE>
<TE>   National organic standards are largely based on ones crafted in
the 1990s in California. Veneman, who served as California's
secretary of Agriculture in the late 1990s, supported strong
organic-labeling standards back then. For example, in 1998, just
after President Clinton's Agriculture secretary, Dan Glickman, had
proposed expanding the federal definition of organic to embrace
genetic engineering and the use of recycled-sewage fertilizer on
organic food, Veneman wrote a letter to Glickman, imploring him to
"revise the rule to ensure a strong organic program." Now that
Veneman is in the hot seat, she shouldn't repeat Glickman's mistake.</TE>

<LD>Sen. Conrad R. Burns (R-Mont.) can't see spending $1.6 billion on a
joint state-federal water program in California--much of it to
protect the environment--if he can't get some money for his state,
too. "I'm not too concerned about sucker fish," he said last week.
"I'm concerned about the breakfast table."</LD>
<LD>   Hold on, senator. This isn't about sucker fish. But it certainly
is about the destruction that state and federal pumping has done to
the environment of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta over the last 50
years. That does include whole salmon populations.</LD>
<LD>   If we're going to put food on breakfast tables, how about keeping
the water flowing to millions of acres in the San Joaquin Valley, the
anchor of California's $27-billion-a-year agricultural industry? The
delta also is a chief source of water for 22 million Californians,
including all of coastal Southern California.</LD>
<TE>   Despite Burns' opposition, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee finally has approved S 1768 by Sen. Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.) to reauthorize federal participation in the Cal-Fed
program to restore the delta--the cleansing maze of sloughs and
channels through which the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers flow en
route to the Pacific Ocean. The delta is where water from the north
is sucked up by the pumps and sent to the San Joaquin Valley and
Southern California via state and federal canals.</TE>
<TE>   Pumping and other actions have devastated salmon runs. Farm runoff
is polluting the water. Poorly maintained levees could collapse in an
earthquake and disrupt a major share of Southern California's water
supply. Feinstein's measure authorizes spending $1.6 billion in
federal money over the next three years, scaled back from $2.4
million over five years to win the needed support. The state has put
up $1 billion in the last several years.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) has a rival House bill that tilts
toward farmers' interests. But Feinstein says the state's major farm
water districts back her bill, which should be the model for the
final legislation. If Cal-Fed fails to pass, it could cause long-term
harm to the economy as water shortages, maldistribution and
environmental damage multiply.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration says it supports Cal-Fed, even though
President Bush's budget managers are said to be unhappy with the
cost. If the White House wants to keep this deal alive, it could help
by sending Secretary of the Interior Gale A. Norton out to join
Feinstein in her uphill fight.</TE>

<LD>Re "Lindh Knew of Attack Plans Worse Than 9/11, Prosecutors Say,"
June 5: Earlier reports by The Times and other U.S. media indicated
that the terrorists who carry out terrorist activities--including
9/11--are customarily not informed of their missions or targets in
advance. How come prosecutors in John Walker Lindh's case are now
saying that Lindh knew of an alleged 20 suicide operations involving
50 operatives?</LD>
<LD>   What is Lindh's real rank in the Taliban or Al Qaeda network? It
just doesn't add up that he wields this much power.</LD>
<LD>   Kofi Paraocha</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to the Justice Department, Lindh, a
U.S.-born-and-educated student, left his school two years ago, hopped
on a plane and flew to Afghanistan--where he was immediately given
all the intimate details of the plan to commit future terrorist
attacks. He even got some of the information personally from Osama
bin Laden. If this low-level flunky could get this kind of top-secret
information with such minimal effort, how is it that the
multibillion-dollar U.S. intelligence agencies had no idea about
9/11?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Barred Travelers Charge 4 Airlines With Race Bias," June 5: The
discrimination suits by the five men who were barred from flying post
9/11 are nearly meritless. If the men fit the profile of the
hijackers, why is it discrimination? What is ridiculous is the
searching of grandmothers and infants--and persons in between--who
have no criteria to indicate they are terrorists but are still
randomly selected.</LD>
<LD>   The taking of penknives, crochet hooks, nail clippers, medals of
honor and the like is ridiculous and downright stupid. These small
items, which I suppose could be utilized as weapons, are so unlikely
to be used for hijacking and are causing more angst when commandeered
from their owners than the threat warrants.</LD>
<LD>   Why not take effective measures to prevent another incident rather
than making up insufficient and inane rules? Why not utilize racial
profiling, if that is the best method of catching criminals? Some
innocents will be singled out by mistake, but what about all the
innocent people being hassled who don't fit the profile?</LD>

<TE>   Since 9/11, air travel has certainly changed. In this context, the
case of the five men who were refused passage and are now suing the
airlines will be worth watching.</TE>
<TE>   Consider this: A 72-year-old woman in a wheelchair is searched,
wanded and required to take off her shoes for inspection before
boarding a plane for Chicago. The woman is my wife. She did not
object to the search, although it caused her some pain. Our return
flight was delayed, and her wheelchair was not there when we arrived.
We waited for it, and the pilot, conscientious, waited with us. We
struck up a conversation. The subject inevitably turned to security.
The pilot observed that everywhere else in the world the authorities
know who the likely suspects are and concentrate on them. In this
country we are afraid to offend anyone, so we avoid profiling. As a
result, we penalize seniors in wheelchairs and risk letting real
culprits get through.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics prove that potential danger doesn't come from
Buddhists, Baptists, Bahais or Hasidim. It comes from Muslims.
Emergencies call for emergency measures.</TE>
<TE>   If those measures caused hardship for five innocent passengers,
the passengers should receive some compensation. But the measures
themselves are vital, regardless of the inconvenience and frustration
they cause.</TE>

<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein's comment that, to prevent terrorism, "one
isn't going to look for blond Norwegians" (quoted in Robert Scheer's
June 4 commentary) deserves a historic reminder: Vidkun Quisling, who
helped Hitler prepare for the conquest of Norway. His name became
synonymous with the word "traitor." Racial profiling was bad enough
for Europe; it would be a disaster in our country.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bush Proposes Cabinet-Level Homeland Security Department," June
7:</LD>
<LD>   FBI agent Coleen Rowley testifies that bureaucracy is crippling
the FBI, and President Bush announces at the same moment that he's
creating ... more bureaucracy! Republicans have always claimed that
they cut fat from government, but the Bush diet plan is carbo-loading
on a massive, suicidal scale.</LD>

<TE>   The Bush administration's proposal to create a new Department of
Homeland Security is well justified and long overdue. Sen. Joseph
Lieberman (D-Conn.) and other prominent Democrats have been
advocating such a Cabinet position for several months. Hopefully,
Bush will be able to persuade many of his fellow Republicans to come
aboard. Our national security depends on it.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Teigan</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the statement that "freedom and security need not be
incompatible" (editorial, June 7) the editors are not really looking
forward. In the end we will have to give up certain freedoms to make
ourselves secure. Each day we stand in lines at airports, are
searched before entering certain areas, and we divert funding to
security, thereby limiting other government programs. Reforming
agencies into larger government bodies will not work.</TE>
<TE>   We will eventually come to the realization that we will have to
use sophisticated identification cards. We will eventually do it. We
have enjoyed so much freedom that we just can't bring ourselves to
the realization that we will have to place some limits on our
freedoms.</TE>

<TE>   There used to be a Department of Homeland Security: It was called
the U.S. Army. Wouldn't one group under Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld do a better job than a gaggle of bureaucrats under Bush?</TE>
<TE>   I'd sure sleep a lot better knowing Rummy was on top of it. Bush
is absolutely frightening.</TE>
<TE>   Robert W. Lovell</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>

<TE>   With Bush's sudden proposal that the position of homeland security
chief be elevated to a Cabinet-level post, another diversion has been
created to take our attention from the troubling questions about his
prior knowledge of 9/11. It's time for him to stop employing the
"Bush dodge" and start giving us some answers.</TE>
<TE>   The craven secrecy and subterfuge are just more dirty tricks from
an administration that continues to act with a complete lack of
ethics or a sense of responsibility. Its pursuit of power and oil at
all costs has cost us all too much already.</TE>

<TE>   I'm happy to know that the president and the government are making
such great efforts to protect us from the danger from terrorists.
Will they be able to do this effectively, since they don't seem to be
able to prevent thousands of illegal immigrants and tons of
marijuana, cocaine and other drugs from entering the country? How,
then, can they stop a relatively few terrorists, with their
destructive equipment?</TE>

<TE>   Does no one else notice the ironic contradiction between two
front-page articles? FBI agent Rowley asserts that an "ever-growing
bureaucracy" hampers agents' ability to function. Meanwhile, in a
news analysis, Doyle McManus writes, "In creating a giant new Cabinet
department to defend the nation from terrorist attacks, President
Bush is hoping to solve several problems at once--some real, some
bureaucratic, some merely political."</TE>
<TE>   Where else but Washington could the creation of a giant
bureaucracy be perceived as resolving bureaucratic inefficiencies?</TE>

<HD>Release on Mahony Followed New Policy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mahony Is Falsely Accused in PR Snafu" (June 5) was unfair and
crossed the line of objective reporting. On June 4, the Los Angeles
Archdiocese issued a press release disclosing that its lawyers had
received an allegation of misconduct by Cardinal Roger Mahony some 20
years ago in Stockton. Even though the allegation was preposterous
and the cardinal emphatically denied that he had ever met or even
heard of the person making the allegation, the archdiocese did what
it has publicly said it was going to do: It disclosed the allegation,
began an investigation and reported it to the proper authorities.</LD>
<LD>   As it turns out, The Times got to the individual before the police
or archdiocesan investigators did and, under questioning, the
individual recanted what was reported to the archdiocese. He, in
fact, confirmed the cardinal's denials. Instead of simply reporting
the facts--that the publicity that now surrounds the Catholic Church
continues to bring forth claims that are sometimes wildly false, and
that the archdiocese had nevertheless adhered to its policy, even
though it knew the allegation was false--The Times characterized what
happened as a "PR snafu," saying that Cardinal Mahony's "spin
machine" had "spun out of control."</LD>
<TE>   There was spin in that story all right, but it came from The
Times, not us. The church has taken a lot of criticism of late from
The Times for protecting itself from public scrutiny or from
inquiries by law enforcement. Some of this criticism is deserved.
Now, however, The Times takes aim at us for publicly following the
policies we said we would follow. It is easy to imagine that if The
Times had been the first to surface this allegation, it would have
been the first to criticize the archdiocese for not disclosing the
information.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Mahony and the archdiocese will continue to do all that
is possible to protect our children and to deal openly, fairly and
decisively with all allegations of clergy sexual abuse.</TE>

<TE>   "L.A. Archdiocese Enlists Services of Top PR Firm" (May 30)
reported that the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles had hired
Sitrick &amp; Co. to bolster the public's image of the church. I was
disappointed to read the advertisement on June 6. There is nothing
wrong with what they say they will do. However, Sitrick and Cardinal
Mahony missed the three most important statements they could make: We
made unconscionable mistakes; we are sorry we made them; and we won't
let them happen again.</TE>

<TE>   A bishop's crosier symbolizes his role as a shepherd leading his
sheep to verdant pastures. However, time and time again, the
modern-day flock realizes it must find its own moral direction,
leaving the shepherds in the rear. Unless dramatically transformed,
the church will soon find itself a cultural anachronism, with a
clergy presiding over ceremonies and rituals but lacking all
influence and power.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's public relations campaign attempts to assure the flock
that, despite decades of moral trespass, the shepherds now know the
way. That way, of course, had already been mapped out by the sheep.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Urged to Step Up Action to Keep Peace in
Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Experts warn that the nation's future and success of
grand council are threatened by ethnic tensions, warlords, poor
security and lack of aid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS and ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Eight months after launching a lightning military campaign in
Afghanistan, the United States is in danger of losing the peace
unless it takes swift action to defuse ethnic rivalries, limit the
powers of warlords, ensure wider security, improve aid distribution
and cope with the flood of returning refugees, warn an array of
officials and experts.</LD>
<LD>   As a loya jirga, or grand council, convenes here in the capital
today to choose new leaders for the nation, many Afghans are
increasingly concerned that their country's needs are being shifted
to the back burner as the U.S. moves its diplomatic focus to crises
elsewhere in South Asia and in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Doubts about the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan permeate the
gratitude felt by the millions being fed, educated, employed and
advised by programs funded by Washington. Bitter memories of the
brutality that took hold after the Soviet Union withdrew from the
country in 1989--and the United States also began to disengage its
aid and political involvement--have left Afghans wary of U.S.
promises.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of Afghan people are still not sure if the United States is
sincere this time or will again disappear after a year or two when
the first part of its goals are achieved," said Abdul Azimi, a law
professor and Afghan liaison for U.S. education aid.</TE>
<TE>   Even as it helps, the Bush administration is pushing Afghanistan
to assume more responsibility for its own needs.</TE>
<TE>   "We want Afghanistan to be self-reliant, to stand on its own feet,
to do the things for itself that it now relies on outside forces
for," said Zalmay Khalilzad, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen who serves
as President Bush's special envoy to the country. "We don't want
Afghanistan to be a security welfare state."</TE>
<TE>   But many Afghans and international aid groups say Afghanistan is
still many years away from any form of self-sufficiency--and actually
needs even more assistance to face new obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we have our own national army and the country is so
thoroughly rebuilt that people cannot conceive of returning to a
Kalashnikov culture, the Americans have no right to leave," Afghan
Reconstruction Minister Mohammed Amin Farhang said.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan officials and others agree that the most immediate threat
to rebuilding the nation is the failure to establish security beyond
Kabul. This lack of security, in turn, hinders food and aid delivery
and efforts to reshape the local balance of political power, warns a
new report by the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based
independent watchdog group on conflict prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "In the absence of that security presence [throughout the
country], fear that the U.S. and the international community are
disengaging and that extremists offer the only alternative for
protection is already resurfacing in popular consciousness," said
Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland and now the chairman
of the International Crisis Group.</TE>
<TE>   Ahtisaari compared the current delicate stage in Afghanistan to
turning points in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda, where the
international community failed to prevent massacres or political
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   He said recent clashes in southeastern, northern and central
Afghanistan indicate that the security situation is deteriorating.</TE>
<TE>   The warlords and militias that divided up the country in 1992,
precipitating the civil strife that allowed the Taliban to take
control in 1996, are once again assuming control, warns Human Rights
Watch, an international monitoring group based in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Human Rights Watch and others say the U.S.-led coalition in
Afghanistan opened the door for the reemergence of the warlords when
it opted not to extend the peacekeeping International Security
Assistance Force beyond Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Human Rights Watch charge that some warlords are
making a grab for power by "brazenly manipulating" participation in
the loya jirga. The warlords are drawing up their own lists of
delegates for the gathering--which will decide who will rule
Afghanistan until elections expected in 2004--and forcing the local
populations to accept them, the rights group asserts.</TE>
<TE>   "If they succeed, Afghans will again be denied the ability to
choose their own leaders and build civil society," said Sam
Zia-Zarifi, the Human Rights Watch senior researcher in Afghanistan.
"This is a make-or-break time for Afghanistan's future."</TE>
<TE>   The United States is helping to assemble an Afghan army, training
the first 500 men for a force targeted to reach 60,000. But even if
all goes well, the army isn't expected to be at full force for five
years.</TE>
<TE>   And unless the Bush administration and its allies do more to deal
with the internal political tensions, a new military is likely to
crumble into rival and warring factions, regional experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   Worsening ethnic tensions further complicate the situation.
Disillusionment with the way power has been distributed among the
Pushtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras and other ethnic groups since the
so-called Bonn Agreement outlined a new political structure for
Afghanistan in December has sparked "deepening factional and ethnic
tensions" in most areas outside Kabul, the International Crisis Group
says.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans, meanwhile, complain that U.S. aid so far has done too
little to repair the physical wreckage of 23 years of war and that
the international community has hesitated to invest heavily in
housing or infrastructure before peace is more secure.</TE>
<TE>   The problems are reflected on the streets of Kabul, a city teeming
with squalid new camps created by hundreds of thousands of refugees
who have flocked back from neighboring Pakistan and Iran and who feel
unsafe anywhere but in the capital. Many are once again stranded,
living under tarpaulins spread over shattered walls.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the United States] had provided more assistance in the first
days of the interim administration, the political benefits of peace
would have been more obvious to the average Afghan citizen," Farhang
said, referring to the six-month term of acting Prime Minister Hamid
Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. aid officials tend to agree that the delivery of relief has
been ponderous, but they argue that the delays were unintentional.
They also insist that the benefits of a widening presence are
visible, even if indirect.</TE>
<TE>   But the instability has crippled several aid efforts, with relief
workers facing kidnapping, robbery and even death. And relief efforts
often come second to the effort to eliminate remnants of the Al Qaeda
terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "Military priorities so overshadow humanitarian ones that
insufficient attention is being paid to the critical funding
shortfalls facing relief agencies," said Roberta Cohen of the
Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. "The World Food
Program still needs to deliver emergency food to 9 million
Afghans--about 40% of the population--but it's 40% to 50%
underfunded. Food distribution could come to a halt by the end of
this month."</TE>

<HD>Arafat Yields, Pares Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The Palestinian leader appoints outsiders to head
finance and security and trims 10 positions. Some dismiss the moves
as superficial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Under tremendous pressure from the international community--not to
mention from his own people--to make some gesture of reform,
beleaguered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday announced a
leaner, slightly redesigned Cabinet.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement in the West Bank city of Ramallah, where the
Palestinian Authority president is based, came as Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon arrived in Washington for his sixth meeting
with President Bush on the intractable Mideast conflict. Bush has yet
to invite Arafat to the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Hours after the Palestinian leader shuffled his government, his
headquarters compound was ringed by Israeli soldiers, tanks and
bulldozers. The army stormed into Ramallah a few hours before sunrise
today, clapped the city, suburbs and refugee camps under a tight
curfew and rounded up suspected militants. Army spokesmen said the
blockade around Arafat's compound was meant to keep fleeing radicals
from hiding within.</LD>
<TE>   One Palestinian, 31-year-old Yasser Sawalha, was reported killed.
Arafat remained unharmed within the remaining walls of his compound,
most of which was demolished by Israeli dynamite and bulldozers last
week.</TE>
<TE>   Amid growing complaints of corruption and autocracy, the
Palestinian leader Sunday cut the number of ministers from 31 to 21.
He also placed a pair of relative political outsiders in charge of
finance and security, two of the most important--and
scrutinized--limbs of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, the changes were light-handed. In a season when the cry
for deep, systematic Palestinian reform has sounded from
international meetings to the markets of the West Bank, Arafat's
moves were roundly dismissed as superficial tweaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's the change people are asking for,"
acknowledged Jihad Wazir, a deputy minister and the son of an
assassinated Palestinian military leader. "It's not so much a reform
as a readjustment. But it's one step."</TE>
<TE>   In the most striking move, economist Salam Fayyad was named
finance minister. The choice of the former International Monetary
Fund representative appeared to be an attempt to counter the
accusations of corruption and financial mismanagement that have
dogged the Palestinian government. Israeli officials have long
accused it of funneling cash and guns to radical groups.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat also named the Palestinian Authority's first interior
minister, retired military commander Abdel Razak Yehiyeh. The
expected appointment of the 73-year-old Yehiyeh had been raising
eyebrows since word of his likely new job title leaked out last week.
He trained in Syria, worked most of his career with an exiled army in
Jordan and still spends much of his time outside the Palestinian
territories, tending to his ailing wife.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, Yehiyeh will be charged with reforming the Palestinian
security forces--a change that the United States and Israel have
urgently sought. But the choice of the aging soldier was generally
understood as an indication that Arafat has no intention of
relinquishing control.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh "comes from the outside, but he knows how to take orders,"
Palestinian political scientist Khalil Shikaki said.</TE>
<TE>   The new Cabinet will steer the government until January, when
Palestinians will have the first chance in seven years to vote in
presidential and parliamentary elections, Arafat spokesman Yasser
Abed-Rabbo noted.</TE>
<TE>   Abed-Rabbo's remarks came at a moment of intense Israeli
indignation: Last week, 17 Israeli bus passengers burned to death in
a suicide bombing engineered by Palestinian militants. Before sunrise
the next day, Israeli troops had stormed to Arafat's headquarters,
demolished almost all of the buildings and shelled his bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Palestinian police in Gaza City arrested Sheik Abdullah
Shami, a leader of the radical Islamic Jihad organization, which
claimed responsibility for the bombing. But it was unclear whether
his arrest signaled the start of a crackdown on militants.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Shami has been arrested by Palestinian police--and
released--on several occasions. He has spoken out recently against
Arafat's authority.</TE>
<TE>   All told, this is a low moment for the Palestinian leader.
According to polls, his approval rating among Palestinians stood at
about 35% three weeks ago. Two years ago, before the peace process
gave way to renegade attacks and Israeli army occupation, he was
backed by nearly half of his people. And in 1996, his popularity hit
75%.</TE>
<TE>   "Palestinians want clean government. They want somebody to clarify
what the intifada is all about, bring back the negotiations with
Israel and put an end to the occupation," Shikaki said. "Arafat lacks
leadership at a time of extreme need, and people are angry with him.
Even when forced to move, he tries as much as possible to make
cosmetic changes."</TE>
<TE>   It's been 20 months since the peace process fell apart, and the
violence has been escalating, with bombings, sieges and funerals
succeeding one another at a brutal pace.</TE>
<TE>   Inflamed by a continuing spate of attacks on Jewish civilians,
Israel has insisted that the Palestinian government tame its radical
groups and reinvent itself through profound reforms--preferably
without Arafat. Otherwise, Israel says, there will be no peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon reiterated that position Sunday in an article on the op-ed
page of the New York Times, asserting that an "elementary commitment
to permanently renouncing violence in the resolution of political
differences has un- fortunately not been kept by the present
Palestinian leadership."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Palestinians have watched their villages and
towns endure weeks of harsh curfews, house-to-house searches and
interrogations. The Israeli army has clamped down so hard on the West
Bank that its economy has all but ground to a halt, and moving from
one town to the next is often impossible for Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Israeli television commentators smirked and rolled
their eyes when they spoke of Arafat's changes. Politicians were
openly scornful.</TE>
<TE>   "We're skeptical. We've seen so-called reforms before," said Arie
Mekel, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. "At the end, it's the
same thing: Arafat running things in the most totalitarian way."</TE>
<TE>   If the Israelis were unimpressed, they weren't alone. Mahmoud
Zahar, a leader of the radical Islamic movement Hamas, scoffed at
Arafat's Cabinet reshuffle.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Islamic Jihad, the radical Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, Hamas refused invitations to join the Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing will happen" with the new Cabinet, Zahar said. "Even a
minor change won't happen."</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian people are grappling desperately--and without
guidance--to come up with a workable political philosophy, Zahar
said. International complaints about Palestinian security, he said,
do not address the issue of whether the military police ought to
protect Israelis from militant attacks, protect Palestinians from
Israeli sieges or strive for the former in hopes of achieving the
latter.</TE>
<TE>   Zahar ticked off his complaints about the Palestinian government:
corruption, the forfeiture of land, a flawed justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "We were hoping for a real reform. We've been waiting for it," he
said. "The people are not looking to be controlled by one idea or one
man. It's not enough to appoint this minister or that."</TE>

<HD>Traces of Nerve Gas Found at Uzbek Base Used by U.S.</HD>
<DH>Military: Sabotage theory is discounted. About 5,000
American troops have been at the facility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A routine environmental inspection turned up traces of nerve and
mustard gas at a military base in Uzbekistan that about 5,000 U.S.
troops have passed through since fall, military spokesmen here
disclosed Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Although the origin of the contaminants remained a mystery, Bagram
headquarters spokesman Col. Roger King played down the possibility
that they might be evidence of terrorist sabotage. He suggested
instead that the gases emanated from spills or chemical weapons
leakage at the base, which was long used by the Soviet army.</LD>
<LD>   Still, all U.S. personnel were evacuated from the areas near the
discovered traces, and inspections by the U.S. Army Center for Health
Promotion and Preventative Medicine, based in Landstuhl, Germany,
have been ordered for all coalition locations in the region,
including this sprawling command post north of the Afghan capital.</LD>
<TE>   No U.S. soldiers have reported symptoms that would alert medical
personnel to illness from exposure, said Col. Doug Liening, chief
surgeon for the Coalition Joint Task Force, which has as many as
17,000 military personnel deployed in and around Afghanistan for the
war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   But further testing and inspections at the Uzbek facility will be
necessary to determine how the contaminants got there, including a
hangar in which the base headquarters staff works, the officers said.</TE>
<TE>   The base, in the village of Karshi Khanabad, is being used by
coalition forces as a staging ground for regional operations. It was
reportedly swept last fall by U.S. environmental experts who failed
to discover any hazardous elements.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no proof that it was placed there recently," Maj. Chet
Kemp, Bagram's deputy chief planner for nuclear, biological and
chemical hazards, said of the nerve agents. Traces that were not
detected in the autumn inspection might be detectable now because
gases are dispersing in the intense seasonal heat of Central Asia, he
added. Daytime temperatures across Afghanistan and in the parched
Uzbek territory to the north regularly reach 120 degrees at this time
of year.</TE>
<TE>   "The central concern now is to identify possible hazards to U.S.
troops," Kemp said, conceding that he would "have a little concern"
about the potential health risks to anyone exposed to the nerve
agent.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any patients from this exposure," Liening said. "No
one, to the best of our knowledge, has gotten sick."</TE>
<TE>   The first nerve gas traces were detected in an unused bunker at
the Karshi Khanabad base on Friday, and more extensive inspection of
the former Soviet site turned up contamination at the hangar that has
been reconstructed to serve as office space, King said. Mustard gas
traces were detected in another hangar at the base Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   King and the medical and hazardous-substance experts sought to
tamp down fears of terrorist involvement, with Kemp noting that the
discoveries were made in secure areas. But with determined Al Qaeda
terrorists openly targeting U.S. forces in the hostile aftermath of
Sept. 11, none of the officers was willing to rule out the
possibility that the nerve agents were planted to endanger U.S.
personnel.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Soviet troops were notoriously lax in
safeguarding even the most dangerous weapons and compounds and left
behind toxic wastelands at many of the bases they occupied during the
Communist era. The Karshi Khanabad base was used by Soviet troops as
a launch pad for their 1979-89 occupation of Afghanistan, during
which they were accused of using chemical weapons against resistance
forces.</TE>
<TE>   How much of the substances are present at the base is unknown,
said Kemp, who added that the vapors could be coming from buried
chemical weapons that are leaking. Coalition forces were attempting
over the weekend to find Soviet and Uzbek officers who might know
more about what was stored at the base before U.S. troops took it
over in October.</TE>
<TE>   Liening said that too little is known about the risks of low-level
exposure to such compounds, but he speculated that "the effects would
be more pronounced after exposure" than months or years later.
Symptoms would probably first be similar to those of the common cold,
he said, but could escalate to include dilated pupils, muscular
twitching and shortness of breath.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he feared a recurrence of the still-unexplained Gulf War
syndrome, which has afflicted some veterans of that 1991 conflict
with comparable symptoms of chemical or biological substance
exposure, Liening dismissed the claims of a systematic problem as
just "theories."</TE>
<TE>   King said that the exact size of the U.S. deployment at Karshi
Khanabad is classified but that the troop strength peaked at about
1,000 and is now slightly lower. Many of the personnel sent to the
Uzbek base spent only a few weeks there before moving on to units
elsewhere in the war theater.</TE>
<TE>   In another indication of dangers still facing coalition troops
waging war against the remnants of Al Qaeda and the deposed Taliban
regime, U.S. troops arrested six heavily armed men before dawn Sunday
in a village in Afghanistan's volatile southeastern region.</TE>
<TE>   Two vehicles carrying the men, plus loaded AK-47 assault rifles,
pistols, rocket launchers and ammunition, were stopped at a roadblock
at 3 a.m. near the village of Shkin, King said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops were trying to identify the men and determine their
motives, King said.</TE>

Life of a 'Martyr'</HD>

<DL>GAZA CITY</DL>
<LD>The three 14-year-olds were ranked No. 1, 2 and 3 in their
eighth-grade class. Smart boys, sharp. Ismail abu Nadi helped friends
with their homework. He always knew the answers.</LD>
<LD>   Ismail and his two classmates, Yusuf Zegout and Anwar Hamdouna,
stole from their Gaza City homes one night this spring and crept
toward a heavily fortified Jewish settlement nearby. The boys--armed
with knives, a small homemade pipe bomb and a hoe to dig under the
settlement's fence--were spotted from a distance by Israeli soldiers
and shot dead.</LD>
<LD>   Ismail and his friends were not alone. On that same late-April
night, six other boys of similar age also set off to attack the
Netzarim settlement. They were stopped by Palestinian police. And a
few days earlier, a boy attempting to attack a different settlement
was shot dead by Israeli soldiers, while a 14-year-old friend with
him turned back at the last minute and was spared.</LD>
<TE>   Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Palestinians have proclaimed their
willingness to become "martyrs," to die in the pursuit of killing
Israeli Jews. In a society increasingly supportive of suicide
bombings and similar attacks, what these children did should not have
been particularly surprising. Still, for a time, it gave pause.</TE>
<TE>   Gazans condemned the boys' deeds. Hamas, a Gaza-based radical
Islamic organization that normally extols the virtues of dying in the
struggle against Israel, branded the acts as futile and banned boys
from such missions, though it was doubtful the group took any action
beyond its statement. It wasn't the attacks per se that angered Hamas
leaders but the performance of them by boys too young to know what
they were doing and how to do it effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail, Yusuf and Anwar left behind classmates at Salahudeen
School in a middle-class Gaza City neighborhood who, at least
publicly, professed horror at how the boys died.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe when we are old enough we can do these things, like when we
are 20," said Riad Muhemar, 14. "Now we should be educating
ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why Ismail did this," added Saleh Haib, 15. "He
never told me what he was going to do, and I would have told him not
to do it if he had. It drove me crazy when I heard."</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen-year-old Mohammed Bamer sat next to Ismail in class for
the last three years. "Of course a martyr is something good, but it's
not for us," Mohammed said. "Certainly he was under a lot of
pressure. But if he had thought more about it, he wouldn't have done
it."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever revulsion was triggered in Gaza by the deaths of Ismail
and his friends was short-lived. The bomber who blew himself up last
month at a park in the Israeli city of Rishon Le Zion, killing two
Israelis, was reported to have been 16. Another 16-year-old was
stopped by Israeli soldiers at a roadblock in the West Bank a couple
of days later and was found to be wearing a belt of explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians are volunteering at an increasing rate to serve as
suicide bombers or to carry out other deadly attacks against
Israelis. The groundswell is fed by outrage over what Palestinians
see as Israeli atrocities against Palestinian civilians, by the
grinding frustration over torturous roadblocks and checkpoints
erected by Israeli forces to impede Palestinian attacks, and by
despair over the future. A person who dies in an act of "resistance"
is assured a place in heaven, as is his or her family, many
Palestinians believe. And that's not to mention economic benefits
paid to survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Gazan psychiatrist Eyad Sarraj, however, believes that another
phenomenon is giving rise to the increase: society's glorification of
the "martyr," the person who dies fighting Israel, be it in a simple
act of throwing a stone or in detonating a bomb in a crowded
discotheque.</TE>
<TE>   With martyrdom, said Sarraj, come status, societal approval and
power. And nowhere is that equation more oversimplified than for the
young.</TE>
<TE>   "We have here a cultural glorification of martyrs in the eyes of
children," Sarraj said. "If you asked children 20 years ago what they
wanted to be when they grew up, they'd say a doctor or an engineer.
Now they say they want to be a martyr."</TE>
<TE>   Celebration of Martyrs</TE>
<TE>   Martyrs are given status unparalleled in Palestinian society,
Sarraj noted. Their pictures are plastered on public walls, their
funerals are emotional celebrations, their families often receive
visits from state officials. They become almost holy, praised by
imams at mosques or over loudspeakers at rallies, where children are
often dressed as shrouded dead or as pint-sized suicide bombers. A
game called shahid, or martyr, is popular among Gazan children. Many
teens have become experts in crafting homemade pipe bombs using
elbow-shaped pieces of plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   Many Palestinian children also receive rudimentary weapons
training at summer camps sponsored by Hamas or mainstream Palestinian
organizations. It was unclear whether Ismail and his classmates
received such training, though their crude weapons were easy to
obtain or assemble from household goods.</TE>
<TE>   "A child likes to identify with heroes, heroes who commit heroic
acts, heroes who represent power," Sarraj said. "The martyr is
fitting that model for the child."</TE>
<TE>   Sarraj, whose iconoclastic views often get him in trouble with
Palestinian authorities, does not discount other motivations for the
child who undertakes a suicide mission: hatred and the desire for
revenge; an opinion, reinforced in Islamic teachings, of death not as
an end but as a passage to a better life.</TE>
<TE>   Most Palestinian children have had to watch their fathers
humiliated at checkpoints by Israeli soldiers, or have heard the
tales of their uncles' time in Israeli prisons. In Ismail's class of
about 35 boys, 15 raise their hands when asked if a close relative
has been killed in the current 20-month-old uprising, or the earlier
intifada that lasted six years and ended in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   But Sarraj sees the child's quest for approval in a culture that
values martyrdom as the overriding motivation, and a phenomenon with
potentially disastrous consequences for Palestinian society in the
long run.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed Nasser, a veteran Gaza-based activist in the Fatah movement
of Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, was alarmed to
learn recently that his 11-year-old son was going around telling
people he wanted to become a martyr.</TE>
<TE>   "My associates were saying to him, so, you'll grow up to be a
Fatah leader like your father," Nasser recalled in his Gaza City
office. "And he said, no, I want to be a martyr. It's the quickest
way to fight for Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   'He Is Still a Child'</TE>
<TE>   Nasser blames the entire environment, from the military actions of
Israel to the endless, violent images on Palestinian television.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of events stamped in his head that make him think
this way," Nasser said of the boy. "I tried to convince him that he
is still a child, that he should wait until he understands the whole
picture. And then when he is old enough he can decide for himself.
But a child cannot make these decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Um Nidal Farahat, a Gazan mother of four, has a very different
attitude. She says she encouraged her sons, from a young age, to
attack Israeli targets and become martyrs.</TE>
<TE>   One son, Mohammed, 17, was killed in March when he attacked
Atzmona, a Jewish settlement in the southern Gaza Strip, and killed
five youths there. Mohammed had been active with Hamas' military wing
since he was 7, Um Nidal told the Saudi newspaper Asharq al Awsat
last month.</TE>
<TE>   "In this atmosphere, Mohammed came to love martyrdom," she said.
"As a mother, I re-enforced this love for martyrdom in the mind of
Mohammed and of all my sons."</TE>
<TE>   She said she discussed the Atzmona operation with Mohammed before
he embarked on it and posed with him for keepsake photos.</TE>
<TE>   According to Israeli researchers, the average age of the suicide
bomber has declined slightly from 22 in the 1990s to about 20 or 21
now.</TE>
<TE>   Bassem Wahidi, the headmaster at Salahudeen School, said he and
the staff will call the police, and then a boy's parents, if they
learn that the boy is planning a suicide attack.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't blame them for doing this, what with everything they
see on TV, but we oppose it because they have a future," Wahidi said.
"They can be a doctor, an engineer, a soldier to kill Israelis. But
at this age they should be educating themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Ismail's father, Mohammed abu Nadi, a 47-year-old civil engineer,
cannot see beyond blaming Israel and its policies for his son's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail, he recalled, was an extremely bright child who spoke
English and wanted to be an engineer and earn a doctorate. Ismail's
bedroom in the large apartment he shared with his parents and four
siblings is well-stocked with a computer, photo scanner and printer.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to take my heart from my body when I learned the news,
because he is more valuable than I am," Abu Nadi said. "On the other
hand, he chose his way, to be a martyr and go to paradise."</TE>
<TE>   The father said the son grew especially angry when the family
attempted weekly visits to Ismail's grandfather in the town of
Mughazi, several miles south of Gaza City. Palestinians traveling
Gaza's main north-south road are often forced to wait for hours while
a single settler, or an army patrol, passes on the east-west road
that cuts across the Gaza Strip to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim.</TE>
<TE>   "He often said he wanted to remove that settlement, and he asked
why it had to be there," Abu Nadi said.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail, like his two companions, left behind a letter for his
parents. He asked that Hamas "adopt" him in death and supervise the
mourning over him, and he urged his brothers to obey the rules of
Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, Dad," Ismail wrote. "Those are the two words that a child
speaks when he starts his life, and so I say them now. I want you to
be happy with me. After I die in this operation, do not be sad,
because I will be a martyr, God willing. Your son, Ismail."</TE>

<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>A leading Indian Kashmiri separatist leader has been detained under a
tough new anti-terrorist law over allegations of funding "terrorist
organizations," police said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Police seized Syed Ali Shah Geelani at his house in Srinagar,
summer capital of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmir region
is at the root of a standoff between nuclear-armed India and
Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   Geelani, 72, is a former head of the All Party Hurriyat (Freedom)
Conference, an alliance of separatist groups in the Himalayan state,
where a revolt against Indian rule has raged for more than a dozen
years.</LD>
<TE>   Hurriyat denounced Geelani's detention as a move to "derail the
ongoing peace process" between India and Pakistan and called a
general strike for Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Geelani, who was taken to a jail in Ranchi in the eastern state of
Bihar, said he did not know why he had been detained. The leader said
he had been striving to defuse tension between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry condemned the arrest, saying it showed
India's disregard for civil liberties.</TE>

<HD>Retirees Balk at Beijing's Bitter Pill</HD>
<DH>China: Upset by unpaid pensions and meager benefits,
seniors are joining labor protests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>BEIJING -- Wang Qianzhan feels entitled to a comfortable retirement,
a golden twilight measured out in meals with friends and hours spent
doting on her only grandchild. It's what she deserves, Wang says,
after toiling for 28 years at a state-owned auto factory in eastern
Beijing.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, what Wang has reaped from all that hard work is a harvest
of worry and anger. Armed with her grievances, this sweet-faced
grandmother has become an unlikely warrior in an army potentially
more dangerous to China's Communist regime than any hostile foreign
force.</LD>
<LD>   Wang, 67, is one of China's millions of disgruntled workers who
once thought themselves the pride of the nation but now see
themselves as victims of it.</LD>
<TE>   A wave of labor unrest is sweeping the nation, whipped up by
discontented workers who gather by the dozens, hundreds and sometimes
thousands to protest the loss of their "iron rice bowls," the welfare
system smashed by China's shift to a market economy.</TE>
<TE>   Their ranks include not just men and women in the prime of their
working lives but a sizable proportion of people like Wang:
silver-haired retirees willing to trade in their knitting needles and
mah-jongg tiles for some gritty street activism.</TE>
<TE>   Angry over unpaid pensions, meager retirement benefits and rampant
corruption, more and more of China's elderly are marching on city
hall. They chant slogans, stage sit-ins and even lie down in traffic,
counting on traditional Chinese respect for age to make their voices
heard--and to shield them from violent suppression.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody pays you any heed if you're on your own," Wang, a veteran
of nearly a dozen sit-ins, said, jabbing a finger for emphasis. "They
only pay attention to a big group."</TE>
<TE>   Such groups have been making headlines recently. Tension among
workers has boiled over into protests across the country, causing
major concern among China's Communist rulers, who prize social
stability above all else and hate challenges to their authority.</TE>
<TE>   In March, huge demonstrations shook the northeastern cities of
Daqing and Liaoyang, where thousands of workers--including a
contingent of retired employees--turned out to vent their anger at
the government over inadequate welfare payments, overdue wages and
scaled-back benefits.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, the streets of Guiyang, a provincial capital in
southern China, were besieged by more than 1,000 former steel
workers. Witnesses described the demonstrators as grandmothers in
their 60s and 70s who blocked roads and forced officials to come out
and listen to their complaints.</TE>
<TE>   And here in Beijing, about 200 of Wang's fellow retirees from the
Beijing United Automobile and Motorcycle Manufacturing Co. staged
their own modest protest March 27. The brigade of demonstrators,
including a few who shuffled with age and infirmity, managed to bring
traffic to a halt on one of the city's busiest ring roads. "There
weren't any younger people there," Wang said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the workers of her generation, who have watched their
benefits shrivel and their social standing plunge, the sense of
betrayal by the government is particularly acute because many still
remember how the Communist Party was propelled to power in 1949 with
their help.</TE>
<TE>   For decades afterward, the party extolled workers as the "leading
class" of the revolution. To be a member of the proletariat was to be
a hero.</TE>
<TE>   But the teachings of Marx have given way to the often bitter
lessons of the market over the last 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we were the masters [of the nation] during Mao's time. We
were respected, and it was glorious to be a worker," said Kang
Fengying, 65, who retired from her job at a food-processing factory
outside Beijing 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she lamented, "we have the lowest status in society."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the new heroes are those previously denounced as
"exploiters": the entrepreneurs who represent the most dynamic
segment of China's economy. Repudiating--at least in practice--what
it once stood for, China's Communist Party now welcomes entrepreneurs
into the fold.</TE>
<TE>   In an almost absurd twist May 1, International Labor Day, the
Chinese government inducted four private businesspeople into its hall
of fame of "model workers," the first time it has bestowed such
honors on its former "class enemies."</TE>
<TE>   Economic planners here have their fingers crossed that the private
sector will absorb many of the legions of unemployed and laid-off
workers from moribund state industries.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the urban jobless rate is less than 4%, but privately,
economists put the figure somewhere between 7% and 10%. A government
report in April, addressing a politically sensitive issue with
unusual candor, warned that the number of jobless in China could top
20 million in four years.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing regime is all too aware of the danger latent in a
population brimming with disaffected workers. The specter of a mass
movement along the lines of Solidarity, which helped end Communist
control of Poland, hovers uncomfortably. In 1989, the formation of an
independent union by protesting workers helped trigger the
government's decision to send tanks into Tiananmen Square to crush
student demonstrators and their sympathizers.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Beijing has opted for a carrot-and-stick approach to
keep events from getting out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   That approach was on display during the protests in Liaoyang and
Daqing, up in China's northeastern rust belt, home to a glut of
bloated and dying state enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   After days of escalating street demonstrations, authorities acted
by nabbing some of the protests' leaders yet also acceding to some of
their demands on unpaid wages and severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the government has largely been able to put out fires
across the country like this before they spread, join up and turn
into one giant conflagration of unrest. Labor protests in China,
though numerous, tend to be scattered and short, too brief and too
localized to coalesce into something greater and more threatening.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that the government is at a point yet where it's in
danger," said Dorothy J. Solinger, an expert on political economy at
UC Irvine. "I don't think it's beyond their control."</TE>
<TE>   Yet the effect has also been to encourage workers to view group
action as a tactic that produces results.</TE>
<TE>   Older workers often see themselves as particularly suited to the
task. In a society that still pays great deference to age, many
retirees bank on the reluctance of young police officers and
officials to resort to violence against their elders, especially the
women who could be their grandmas.</TE>
<TE>   "Beating younger [people] is easier than older, and beating men is
easier than women," said Han Dong-fang, a Chinese labor activist
exiled to Hong Kong after the Tiananmen Square massacre. For
fresh-faced police guards to swing their clubs and knock down senior
citizens would be to commit a major social sin.</TE>
<TE>   After four organizers of the protest in Liaoyang were arrested, a
wheelchair-bound older worker allowed other demonstrators to push him
forward and call him their leader, daring the authorities to lay
their hands on a sick old man, Han said.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, many workers in their 30s and 40s feel they have too
much to lose by taking to the streets and risking retaliation by the
government, which could easily deprive them of their livelihoods.</TE>
<TE>   "If we 40- to 50-year-olds organized and kicked up a fuss, we'd
get thrown in jail," said Wu Yanding, 47, a laid-off factory worker
who lives near Liaoyang. Wu now sells stockings to passersby on the
street.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Beijing, Wang, the retired auto factory employee, doesn't
bear such responsibilities anymore. So she has few qualms about
agitating for the things she and her former co-workers believe are
theirs by right.</TE>
<TE>   She wasn't involved in the March 27 protest that stopped traffic,
but she participated in an onslaught of sit-ins before that, with 400
to 500 other old colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Together, they presented factory officials with three demands:
reimbursement of their medical bills, which hadn't happened for
several years; payment of a small housing allowance due them every
month; and elimination of the fee for using the factory's bathhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "We built that bathhouse ourselves back when I was an employee,"
Wang said. "They shouldn't charge us to use it."</TE>
<TE>   The factory honchos listened politely but did nothing about their
demands. So the retirees chose representatives among their ranks,
went back again and overran the factory's conference room. "Some sat
on tables; others sat on chairs," Wang recalled.</TE>
<TE>   That sit-in produced some dialogue, but again no action.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, emboldened a bit each time, the group staged 11
sit-ins, and finally the bosses caved. "I went all 11 times," Wang
said.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the factory bow to all their demands, but the
geriatric jousters wrung another concession that would make many
Americans envious: The retirees were allowed to go to any doctor and
hospital they chose, not just the company's designated health-care
provider.</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty good," Wang said in a satisfied tone. "What more do
you want?"</TE>

<DH>Health: Religious leaders can become the new voice for
millions of children left parentless by the disease, activists say at
Nairobi gathering.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>By 2010, the United Nations expects 20 million children in
sub-Saharan Africa to be so-called AIDS orphans, their parents having
succumbed to the deadly disease.</LD>
<LD>   The AIDS pandemic has already left 14 million African children
parentless. Many are now cared for by aging grandparents. Others,
barely able to care for themselves, are heads of households, minding
younger siblings. And hundreds of thousands more live on harsh
African streets.</LD>
<LD>   As HIV infection has laid waste to communities across Africa,
however, the continent's religious leaders have remained largely
silent. But Sunday, some of Africa's top clerics gathered in this
capital to discuss how the religious community could make up for lost
time and become a new voice for the legions of children devastated by
AIDS.</LD>
<TE>   "Through our silence and denial, we have contributed to increased
stigma and exclusion of people living with HIV/AIDS and their
families," said Twaib Mukuye, a leader of Uganda's Muslim community.
Now "we are here to launch a continent-wide jihad on AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting leaders of various religious denominations--from
traditional healers to Roman Catholic priests--has become a key
strategy for U.N. officials and community leaders lobbying on behalf
of the 25 million people in sub-Saharan Africa living with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Sunday, UNICEF Director Carol Bellamy said
religious groups are uniquely suited to address social problems
involving AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Through their churches, mosques and temples, Bellamy said, leaders
could disseminate information about how the disease can be treated
and prevented. Many religious groups also have at their disposal
networks of schools, hospitals and social service organizations that
could be used to help AIDS patients and their families.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as HIV/AIDS remains a shameful disease, it will not be
taken on fully," Bellamy said.</TE>
<TE>   Some African clerics have campaigned for affordable AIDS drugs.
Others, including Catholic priests, have challenged the Vatican's
opposition to birth control, including condoms. But for the most
part, clerics have been reluctant to preach about AIDS and
prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "We still hear sermons from preachers who say people who are
infected deserve that," said Ludfine Opudo, who heads the Kenya
chapter of the Society for Women and AIDS in Africa, an advocacy
group.</TE>
<TE>   "These same people can do immense good if they speak with one
voice about people who lose their jobs because they have AIDS, or
about children who are disinherited after their parents die, or talk
about the general stigma of having AIDS in a developing country,"
said Opudo, who is HIV positive and the mother of an 8-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   In Africa, the burden of caring for AIDS orphans has fallen mostly
on nongovernmental organizations, along with relatives and friends of
the deceased.</TE>
<TE>   During the last three years, Leonora Obara has seen her family
grow to 10 children, thanks to the five AIDS orphans she has taken
into her small home in the Umoja estate, about 15 miles outside
Nairobi.</TE>
<TE>   After her husband's brother and his wife both died within the last
eight months, Obara faced the prospect of watching two nephews and a
niece join thousands of Nairobi street children who have nowhere to
go.</TE>
<TE>   But three years ago, Obara, a 39-year-old social worker, had
already brought home two young children who became orphans when one
of her clients died.</TE>
<TE>   At first, her husband objected to her taking in the orphans,
saying their meager annual income--a little more than $10,000--was
already stretched thin. He agreed when Obara, a devout Seventh-day
Adventist, pointed to scriptures extolling the virtues of caring for
widows and orphans.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to take in the orphans meant that the Obaras had to
rent another room adjacent to their small two-bedroom apartment,
which is constructed of concrete blocks. Now, eight girls, ranging in
age from 2 to 12, sleep in a small kitchen that has been converted to
accommodate five bunk beds. The two boys sleep in a separate room.</TE>
<TE>   Her rent, grocery and education bills have increased dramatically,
but Obara said she manages to survive without help from anyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a lot of money, but we have a little compassion for
these children," she said softly.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the 120 clerics attending the three-day gathering here on
children and HIV/AIDS will visit orphanages run by nongovernmental
organizations, church groups and individuals to see how they could be
replicated in their own countries.</TE>
<TE>   Clerics will also be given tutorials on caring for and supporting
AIDS orphans and developing national strategies to lobby on behalf of
AIDS patients.</TE>
<TE>   Mercy Manci, a traditional healer from Pretoria, South Africa, who
is representing an association that promotes traditional African
medicinal systems, said the various religious groups have to forget
their theological differences and implement a coordinated plan to
help AIDS orphans.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes, she said, are high.</TE>
<TE>   "Because society has been late in stopping the deaths of their
parents, we have to work quickly to save the next generation--before
it's too late," she said.</TE>

<HD>Hostage Survivor Backs Manhunt</HD>
<DH>The Philippines: Gracia Burnham praises rescuing troops.
The missionary condemns her captors, the Abu Sayyaf, as criminals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Kansas missionary Gracia Burnham, who lost her husband and a year of
her life as a hostage in the Philippine jungle, left for the United
States today saying the Islamic rebels who kidnapped them "should be
treated as common criminals."</LD>
<LD>   "During our ordeal, we were repeatedly lied to by the Abu Sayyaf,
and they are not men of honor," she told reporters at the Manila
airport. "We support all efforts of the government in bringing these
men to justice."</LD>
<LD>   Burnham and her husband, Martin, were kidnapped more than a year
ago by the Abu Sayyaf. He was killed Friday and she was shot in the
leg during a rescue attempt by the Philippine army that went awry.
Hostage Deborah Yap, a Philippine nurse, also died.</LD>
<TE>   Burnham, sitting in a wheelchair, appeared calm and relaxed, but
her voice trembled at times as she read a statement to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "We especially want to thank the military men, the Americans, the
Filipinos who risked and even gave their lives to rescue us," she
said. "Part of my heart will always stay with the Filipino people."</TE>
<TE>   With the death of Martin Burnham and Yap, the Philippine
government has sworn to destroy the Abu Sayyaf gang, which has
kidnapped dozens of people in the southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   But as the Islamic extremist group has repeatedly proved,
eradicating the rebels from the rugged islands where they enjoy
popular support is no easy matter.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, the United States has deployed more than 1,000
troops to the region to train and assist the Philippine army. Last
month, the U.S. offered a $5-million reward for the capture of Abu
Sayyaf leaders. The Pentagon has given the Filipinos sophisticated
military equipment and used high-tech surveillance methods to track
the rebels' movements.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even with U.S. military help, the Philippine army is no closer
to crushing the Abu Sayyaf than it has been since the group was
formed a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Philippine troops were pursuing 50 members of the gang
through the dense jungle of Mindanao island, but no sightings or
clashes have been reported since the shootout Friday. Officials said
the rebels had split up into small groups and escaped into the dense
undergrowth after the battle in which Martin Burnham, Yap and four
rebels were killed.</TE>
<TE>   Officers initially said the two hostages were executed by the
kidnappers. But Gracia Burnham has told relatives that they were shot
in the cross-fire after Philippine troops attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated Philippine soldiers had been trying to find and rescue
the Burnhams and Yap since they were kidnapped. Critics questioned
Sunday whether the $5-million reward for the Abu Sayyaf's leaders had
prompted the soldiers to become trigger-happy, leading to the two
hostages' deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Burnham expressed no bitterness toward the soldiers. U.S.
officials say they blame only the rebels and will not seek an inquiry
into the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear to us Martin was killed by the Abu Sayyaf," U.S.
Ambassador Francis Ricciardone told reporters at the airport. "They
are criminally culpable."</TE>
<TE>   Top Philippine officials were unwilling to discuss their strategy
now in pursuing the Abu Sayyaf on Mindanao. But experience shows that
the rebels are elusive and unpredictable jungle warriors who are
likely to kidnap new victims as they travel.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, they were able to slip away last month from Basilan
island, where the Philippine army believed it had them cornered. The
rebels took their hostages on small fishing boats to much larger
Mindanao despite a Philippine army cordon and U.S. surveillance
flights.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf, which means "Father of the Sword," was founded by
Abdurajak Abubakar Janjalani, a Muslim who fought in Afghanistan
against the Soviet Union and espoused the creation of an Islamic
state in the southern Philippines. After he was killed by police in
1998, the group drifted from its Islamic dogma and became a brutal
kidnap-for-ransom gang.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1995, the group maintained links to Osama bin Laden, whose
allies were active in the Philippines. Today, the U.S. government
says the gang is still tied to Al Qaeda, although little evidence of
a connection has surfaced publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Sept. 11 attacks and the start of the U.S. war against
terrorism, Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo played down
the group's ideological roots and portrayed it as "a bunch of
bandits." But since the attacks on New York and the Pentagon, she has
branded the group an international terror organization.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has given the Philippine government $100 million in
aid to fight the rebels and sent the U.S. troops, including 160
Special Forces, to train and assist the Philippine army until July
31.</TE>
<TE>   The Abu Sayyaf appears to be a loosely structured organization
with separate forces operating under autonomous commanders on at
least three islands. The main body of about 500 rebels is on Jolo
island, about 60 miles from Basilan and Mindanao, the islands where
the Burnhams were taken and where the U.S. troops are stationed.
Authorities say at least 70 armed rebels remain on Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Maj. Richard Sater said that Friday's rescue mission was
conceived and executed entirely by the Philippine armed forces. After
the firefight, U.S. helicopters helped evacuate Gracia Burnham, and
U.S. military medics treated her wound, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. troops in the southern Philippines are armed and
may fire in self-defense, Philippine law prohibits them from engaging
in combat operations.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're doing here until we depart at the end of July is
advising and assisting them to hone their skills to combat
terrorism," said Sater, who is based in Zamboanga City on Mindanao
island.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he said, the U.S. trainers are focusing on basic
skills such as marksmanship and first aid.</TE>
<TE>   Now, without any hostages in the picture, the dynamic of the
government's military operation has changed.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels fleeing from the troops can no longer use the hostages
as shields and will be more vulnerable to attack. At the same time,
they will be able to move more quickly through the jungle and will be
able to blend in with the local population. Indeed, if they stash
their weapons and shed their camouflage uniforms, they will be all
but indistinguishable from the island's local population.</TE>
<TE>   Since the death of the hostages, the Philippine army has poured
thousands of troops into the area to search for the rebels. Regional
military commander Maj. Gen. Ernesto Carolina declared, "We will not
let them get away with this."</TE>

<HD>Soccer Fans Riot in Moscow</HD>
<DH>Sports: One person is slain after Russian team loses to
Japan in the World Cup. Police are faulted for lax security at
outdoor TV viewing site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAURA REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Soccer fans went on a rampage in the heart of Moscow on Sunday,
torching cars, breaking windows and battling police while watching
Russia lose a World Cup soccer match to Japan on an outdoor TV screen
just outside the Kremlin. One person was fatally stabbed and at least
two dozen were injured.</LD>
<LD>   The unrest was the worst in the Russian capital since an uprising
in parliament in 1993.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday's riot broke out during the second half of the game, when
Japan scored the contest's only goal. Drunken fans took out their
anger on vehicles parked near the viewing site, in Manezh Square at
the northern entrance to Red Square, setting more than half a dozen
ablaze, overturning others and smashing the windows of dozens more.</LD>
<TE>   They also threw beer bottles at one another and through windows of
Russia's lower house of parliament, across the street from Manezh
Square. Then, dispersing onto radiating streets, the rioters smashed
the windows of half a dozen Japanese and Chinese restaurants and
attacked five Japanese citizens, injuring one.</TE>
<TE>   Riot police arrived an hour and a half after the melee began,
according to state television. Sixty people were reported detained.
Reports of those injured ranged between 20 and 100; of the injured,
11 were reported to be police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei K. Volin, the government's deputy chief of staff, called
the violence "an insult to the millions of people who supported the
Russian team."</TE>
<TE>   At least some of the rioters appeared to be skinheads. They were
heard chanting, "Onward, Russia" and "Victory to skinheads"--slogans
associated with Russian neo-Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   Yuri Korchagin, manager of the Ginno Taki Japanese restaurant,
said rioters shouted anti-Japanese slogans as they hurled bottles and
metal bars through five of his eatery's six large glass windows.</TE>
<TE>   Diners scurried out of the way of the flying glass, and no one was
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not know whether it was a setup or not, but I am afraid that
the same outcome could have been possible even if the Russian team
had won the game," Korchagin said. "These idiots in the mob would
still have decided to 'kick some ass'even if they were happy about
the victory. They are totally unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   Criticism quickly focused on the police. A state television anchor
described the official presence near the outdoor TV screen as
woefully inadequate, amounting to just 10 mounted police officers.
But Moscow Police Chief Vladimir Pronin defended his force's
performance, saying that many more fans had turned out to watch the
match than the 500 expected. He said the number of viewers might have
topped 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   Police provided little information about the one reported death;
an Associated Press photographer who saw the body described the
victim as white and apparently in his 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Five Japanese citizens who were in town to attend the world-famous
Tchaikovsky music competition were accosted by drunken fans as they
walked near the Moscow Conservatory, said Tsuyoshi Kurihara, a
spokesman for the Japanese Embassy. A man in the group was struck on
the head and slightly injured, but the rioters did not touch his four
female companions.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the game, we were concerned about the safety of Japanese
citizens living in Moscow and advised all of them not to appear in
the streets," Kurihara said.</TE>
<TE>   The World Cup loss to Japan was a serious blow to the Russian
team, whose star player has been sidelined by injuries. But the
defeat did not knock Russia out of the tournament, and it is
scheduled to play Belgium on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A Moscow city spokesman said plans to broadcast subsequent World
Cup matches on large outdoor screens have been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Tunisia's 2 Faces of Progress</HD>
<DH>The North African nation is a model of development and
stability. But dissent is quashed, and an Islamist movement is
growing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TUNIS, Tunisia</DL>
<LD>The men pounced, their beefy hands grabbing, pushing, shoving. There
were a dozen of them, at least, and they hurled themselves at anyone
in their way. Others banged bottles on a car, menacing a group of
women as they tried to flee.</LD>
<LD>   The assailants didn't identify themselves, but here, as in much of
the Arab world, there was no need. It wasn't so much the clothes,
which were casual, as much as it was the attitude: These men could do
whatever they wanted, whenever they felt like it. They were the
police.</LD>
<LD>   In this case, they'd been dispatched by the government to stop a
group of human rights activists from demonstrating for the release of
political prisoners.</LD>
<TE>   "Tunisia presents itself as this good student to the international
community," said Omar Mestiri, the founder of a banned human rights
monitoring group who sported a deep purple bruise under his eye after
the recent fracas. "It's very progressive in economic matters, and it
says it is working on human rights. That's the face of it. But on the
inside, it is a police state."</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia's general-turned-president, Zine el Abidine ben Ali,
promised democracy when he came to power in 1987 in a bloodless coup.
He instituted the usual trappings, allowing for opposition press,
freeing some political prisoners and even abolishing the post of
president-for-life.</TE>
<TE>   But all it takes is a quick stroll down most any street here in
the capital to experience what it's like to be followed by agents who
make little attempt to stay hidden. The system is designed to
intimidate--and to keep the ruling group in power. Just last month,
the president pushed through a constitutional change that will, in
effect, allow him to serve as president for life.</TE>
<TE>   Like many regimes in the Arab world, Ben Ali's government is
sitting on a volcano of popular discontent stoked by religious fervor
and international events such as the Palestinian intifada. Tunisians,
like many Arabs in the Middle East, are also immensely frustrated
with their own entrenched leadership, limits on democracy and the
widespread use of force and intimidation to silence political
opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia is a stable country in North Africa, sandwiched between
two volatile and even more oppressive neighbors, Algeria and Libya.
Its capital, Tunis, is a cosmopolitan city, with a European flair and
majestic palm trees lining the main boulevard. Tunisia does more than
70% of its trade with Western Europe, spends more than 50% of its
budget on social and developmental programs and reports that 85% of
the population owns a home.</TE>
<TE>   Its streets are clean, its shops are filled, and it is eager to
present itself as a modern, secular state.</TE>
<TE>   Fear of Speaking Out</TE>
<TE>   The government rejects the notion that the nation is a police
state, but from Tunis to the coastal resort towns of the south, many
Tunisians--shopkeepers and homemakers, nurses and senior
citizens--speak of a regime that relies on fear and intimidation to
keep everyone, not just Islamists, in line. Speak out against the
regime, and your mother might be harassed. Join a banned
organization, and your children might be thrown out of school. Your
phone lines might be cut. Your cars stolen. Offices ransacked.
Passports confiscated. Jobs taken away.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir Abeid, 34, is a typical example of what happens when
someone gets involved in activities the government doesn't condone.
He was studying general history more than a decade ago when he became
a student leader calling for better conditions for students and
prisoners. Over the years, he's been arrested, held in prison and had
his passport taken away, though it was returned.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, he says he has been repeatedly tortured, charges that have
been supported by independent human rights groups. The authorities,
he says, shocked him on his genitals, manacled his wrists behind his
ankles and beat him while suspended from a rod. He says he was hanged
from his neck, dropped in a vat of urine and kept awake for days at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   "I have chosen this path, and these are the consequences," he
said. "It is not easy fighting a police state."</TE>
<TE>   The modern state of Tunisia was fathered by Habib Bourguiba, a
French-trained lawyer who led the country to independence from France
in 1956. His was a dictatorship, but a relatively enlightened one for
the region. He granted unparalleled rights to women, including the
right to vote and serve in government, to sue for divorce and to have
an abortion. Polygamy, permitted in the Koran, was outlawed.</TE>
<TE>   Roots of Repression</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the Bourguiba regime concluded that the Islamic
movement Nahda had gained too much power. Motivated by the success of
the Islamic revolution in Iran and financed by Persian Gulf states,
Nahda, according to government officials, was planning to overthrow
the regime. Islamists were rounded up en masse and thrown in prison,
and the party structure was dismantled.</TE>
<TE>   So-called moderate regimes such as those in Egypt and Tunisia have
succeeded in minimizing the influence of Islamic-based opposition
groups with strict security measures.</TE>
<TE>   In Tunisia, government critics say the iron-fisted approach has
turned a moderate Islamic movement with limited support into a
radical underground with widespread sympathy. They say the April
suicide bombing at an ancient synagogue on the island of Djerba is a
sign of such a backlash. The explosion left at least 16 dead and has
been linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of democracy, the lack of a political process and the
lack of pluralistic society brings Islamists together and will make
all or most of the opposition go toward the Islamists," said Mokhtar
Yehyaoui, a Tunisian magistrate who was thrown off the bench when he
appealed to the president for judicial independence last year.
"Religion is the only tool left that will integrate society together
.... It is this emptiness that makes everyone turn to Islam as the
last resort."</TE>
<TE>   Radiha Nasraoui, a prominent human rights lawyer and wife of a
now-imprisoned opposition leader, belongs to a political class that
initially supported the crackdown on the Islamists. These were people
who wanted Western-style democracy, who looked to Europe as a model,
not to Tunisia's Arab neighbors. The thought of an Iranian-style
republic terrified them.</TE>
<TE>   Three years after Ben Ali came to power, Nasraoui defended an
opposition political leader who had been charged with a crime. When
she entered the courtroom, she was arrested and held in prison for
many days.</TE>
<TE>   "Bourguiba was a dictator," she said recently, "but he never
arrested a lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Sihem ben Sedrine, another activist who has been beaten, harassed
and jailed for her human rights work, said: "What we realized was he
was not just crushing the Islamists. He was crushing democracy and
civil society too."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Ben Sedrine, Nasraoui and others of their political leaning
find themselves pressing for Islamists to be allowed to join the
political process and for all of the approximately 1,000 political
prisoners held by the state--the majority of whom are Islamists--to
be granted amnesty. They may not support the Islamists' agenda, but
they support their right to pursue that agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years after the coup, Ben Ali is still in power. The
constitution, however, permitted only three five-year terms in
office. Ben Ali and his ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally party
had other ideas, and he presented the country with a referendum. It
would change the constitution to allow the 65-year-old president to
run again in 2004 and in 2009. If he should live so long as to lose
power, the referendum granted him immunity from prosecution for life.</TE>
<TE>   Attempt to Infiltrate</TE>
<TE>   Nasraoui and her colleagues in the democracy movement wanted to
discuss the referendum, so they gathered two days before the May 26
vote in a tiny two-room office on the second floor of a Tunis
walk-up.</TE>
<TE>   When they arrived for the meeting, a crowd of men was standing
outside, bunched together in a knot, staring at everyone who went in,
following some as they left.</TE>
<TE>   Taha Sassi was sitting on the steps outside the office when he
spotted a man in a green suit, smoking a cigarette, trying to mingle
with the crowd. Sassi jumped up, grabbed the man's lapels and hurled
him down the stairs. He said he knew that the man was an informant.</TE>
<TE>   Sassi, a 27-year-old philosophy student, had already spent more
than a year in jail because of informants, and he had no tolerance
for them.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, he sat in a cafe talking about the incident when two
large men entered the nearly empty restaurant and sat right beside
him. The men sat for a few minutes, stared at Sassi and his friends,
then left.</TE>
<TE>   "You can only guess who is secret police," he said, reflecting the
paranoia many Tunisians live with.</TE>
<TE>   Leader's Term Extended</TE>
<TE>   Two days after Nasraoui and her colleagues met, the polls opened
for the approximately 3 million Tunisians eligible to vote on the
referendum. When a government official was asked how soon vote
results would be available, he said, "Officially, we expect this to
pass."</TE>
<TE>   Although voters stood behind a black curtain to cast their
ballots, secrecy was virtually impossible. "Yes" ballots were white;
"no" ballots were black and could clearly be seen through the thin
envelopes. Even if attendants couldn't see, they reportedly asked for
the unused ballots back.</TE>
<TE>   For all the criticism, the government pointed out that this was a
major step toward democracy for Tunisia because it was the first time
the constitution had been amended through a public vote.</TE>
<TE>   The government was eager for a large turnout, hoping to give the
president some cover for staying in office, but apathy on the streets
appeared widespread and polling stations in several towns were empty
during the day. One Western diplomat said he expected no more than a
50% turnout.</TE>
<TE>   But when it was all over, the headline on the Tunisian daily La
Presse said, "A Giant Yes." The government reported 96.15% voter
turnout--and a whopping 99.61% "yes" vote.</TE>
<TE>   The results, Interior Minister Hedi M'Henni said at a news
conference, "surprise only those who do not know Tunisia."</TE>

<HD>California Courts Sentencing Fewer Killers to Death Row</HD>
<DH>Justice: The decline comes as violent crime falls. D.A.s
are more selective in capital cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of defendants sentenced to death in California is falling
at its most rapid pace since the state reinstituted the death penalty
25 years ago, according to an analysis of state records.</LD>
<LD>   The drop in death sentences between 1999 and 2001--from 43 to
21--came as violent crime also plummeted. But the falling crime rate
explains only part of the decline in death sentences. Publicity about
innocent people freed from the nation's death rows and reluctance by
prosecutors to pursue a penalty that may never be imposed have
reduced the number of cases, attorneys and legal experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "The D.A.s are becoming more discriminating in seeking the death
penalty," said Gary Schons, an assistant attorney general who
oversees death-penalty appeals in several Southern California
counties.</LD>
<TE>   "They have had the benefit of having lived with this law for
nearly 25 years," Schons added. "They have also seen the tremendous
cost of getting cases through the system, both in fiscal costs and
the emotional costs to the survivors."</TE>
<TE>   California is home to the nation's largest death row, with more
than 600 convicted murderers awaiting execution. The state has
executed nine people since reinstating capital punishment in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Although district attorneys said they have not changed their
criteria for deciding whether to seek death, state records indicate a
greater proportion of defendants eligible for death are receiving
life in prison instead. In 1999, 19.3% of defendants convicted of
capital murder received death sentences. By 2001, the number had
fallen to 12.6%.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego County, for instance, none of the 27 people convicted
of capital murder in 2000 and 2001 were sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of it may be the fact that it's so difficult to execute
someone," said San Diego County Public Defender Steven J. Carroll.
"It takes so much time and money, the decision-makers may be deciding
it isn't worth it to try unless it's a really aggravated case."</TE>
<TE>   The same pattern can be seen in other urban counties. In Los
Angeles County, 15 defendants were sentenced to death in 1998--14% of
those who were potential capital cases. Last year, the number of
death sentences fell to seven, or 9%.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, where seven killers were sent to death row in
1997, only one defendant received death last year--a Santa Ana gang
member convicted of shooting a man in the back of the head during a
street robbery. Prosecutors sought the death penalty in one other
case--a Santa Ana man who intentionally drove his car onto a
preschool playground and killed two children. The man's attorneys
argued he was mentally ill, and the jury recommended a sentence of
life in prison without parole.</TE>
<TE>   One of the state's largest shifts has occurred in Riverside
County. In 1998 and 1999, prosecutors obtained 13 death sentences out
of 24 eligible cases. In 2000 and 2001, they obtained five death
sentences out of 35 eligible cases, according to records.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County Dist. Atty. Grover Trask said that despite the
numbers, his test for what makes a death-penalty case remains the
same: Is the death penalty appropriate, given all the circumstances,
and would a jury be likely to return a death verdict?</TE>
<TE>   His approach has changed through the years. For instance, Trask
said he has learned that juries in his county are less likely to
return death verdicts when the defendant is young or the crime is
committed among family members.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand the costs and other issues. We obviously do not
want to go forward on cases where there's no reasonable likelihood a
jury will return a verdict of death," Trask said.</TE>
<TE>   California's experience mirrors a national trend. The 214 death
sentences imposed in the United States in 2000 were the lowest since
1980, according to a U.S. Justice Department report.</TE>
<TE>   The drop in death sentences in California corresponds with a big
fall in murders across the state. The number of homicides in
California dropped from 3,876 in 1992 to 2,074 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The declines also come as the death penalty is under increased
scrutiny. There have been highly publicized reports of wrongly
convicted inmates freed from death rows and allegations of racial
bias in application of the death penalty. Illinois and Maryland
imposed moratoriums on capital punishment. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals has reversed eight California death sentences since
November.</TE>
<TE>   Several polls have found that support for the death penalty in
California and the nation is declining, although a majority still
supports it. A 2000 Field Poll found that most Californians would
support a moratorium on the death penalty until its fairness is
studied further.</TE>
<TE>   Although the death penalty might not be as popular as it once was,
prosecutors point to other factors as reasons for the declining
numbers. Many gang leaders who caused the spike in homicides in the
early 1990s are behind bars, resulting in fewer of the killings that
could warrant the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "There's public sentiment moving away from the death penalty ...
but that's not the big factor," said Santa Clara County Dist. Atty.
George Kennedy, whose office obtained just one death sentence in the
last three years. "We've been lucky during that time period not to
have the kinds of cases that jurors will return death on."</TE>
<TE>   District attorneys in many counties--Los Angeles, Riverside and
Orange among them--have established committees of veteran prosecutors
to help decide whether to pursue death sentences. They review
available evidence and invite comment from defense lawyers before
making the choice.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll, the San Diego public defender, said his attorneys start
investigating the backgrounds of murder defendants as soon as
possible--exploring a defendant's family history and psychological
background--so they can make a powerful argument against the death
penalty to San Diego County Dist Atty. Paul Pfingst.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't go in and try to prove our client innocent to the D.A.
What we try to do is convince him a death decision is not
appropriate," Carroll said. "We've had tremendous luck in doing it.
So we've had much fewer death cases going through."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Ray F. Herndon and Doug Smith contributed to
this report.</TE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>A ferocious and unpredictable wildfire continued to burn out of
control near the resort town of Glenwood Springs on Sunday, and for a
second day a capricious wind bedeviled all efforts to battle the
blaze from the air.</LD>
<LD>   The fast-moving fire--which destroyed 25 homes and consumed more
than 7,500 acres in 24 hours--was one of a dozen that erupted in
Colorado over the weekend. A second major blaze that began burning in
the Pike National Forest 50 miles southwest of Denver devoured 25,000
acres of pine trees and moved rapidly toward the city, causing
evacuations as it blasted through an area thick with summer cabins
and mountain homes. No structures were lost.</LD>
<LD>   Both fires were at zero containment, and both flared anew as winds
kicked up in the afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   Thick clouds of smoke covered the region, traveling as far as
southern Wyoming. By midafternoon Sunday, Denver's skies turned dark
and wind-borne ash fell in parts of the city; the plume of smoke from
the Pike fire rose to 15,000 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens likened the sight to a "nuclear winter."</TE>
<TE>   Hospitals were handling scores of cases of respiratory distress
and anxious residents' calls swamped emergency lines. The state
health department advised residents to stay indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Still another blaze in southwest Colorado had burned 2,000 acres
near Durango. Several hikers were airlifted out of the area.</TE>
<TE>   In the same part of the state, another blaze was threatening oil
and gas fields. Yet another group of fires that had been burning for
more than a week continued to scorch upward of 30,000 acres in the
southern part of the state. Six of the wildfires were being fought by
federal crews.</TE>
<TE>   A 70-mile section of Interstate 70--the state's major east-west
highway--was closed most of the day Sunday, stranding thousands of
travelers and truckers. Guardrails and road signs were burning along
the highway, as were railroad ties on the Southern Pacific line.</TE>
<TE>   Glenwood Springs already has been declared a federal disaster
area, and most of Colorado was on extreme fire alert Sunday. Earlier
this month the state was declared a disaster area because of the
persistent drought. Despite a statewide ban on open fires, the blaze
south of Denver is thought to have been started by a campfire.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe the Glenwood Springs blaze broke out when a
fire smoldering in an underground coal seam broke through the ground
and ignited dry oak brush Saturday afternoon. The coal fire has been
burning for about 30 years, officials said, and has been responsible
for a number of fires.</TE>
<TE>   Glenwood Springs--a town of about 7,700 perched at the mouth of
the spectacular Glenwood Canyon--was bisected by the fire. Many
residents were caught away from their homes and could not cross the
fire line; visitors were unable to leave. A vintage railroad that
ferries tourists through the canyon to the hot springs was shut down
out of concern that sparks from the train could ignite a fire.</TE>
<TE>   The historic downtown was spared but remained surrounded by fire
Sunday. Most hotels were evacuated--along with 2,000 residents--and
many businesses were closed. Dozens of onlookers lined the bridge
that spans the Colorado River and watched as trees exploded in
fireballs.</TE>
<TE>   Susan O'Connell stood watch over her empty hotel Sunday, keeping
an eye on the flames advancing across a ridgeline.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two walls of fire around us," she said, looking out her
window. "We are in the middle.... We're just praying."</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 National Guard troops were dispatched to assist the
Garfield County sheriff with security. No injuries were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The fire began in the same area as the 1994 blaze on Storm King
Mountain that killed 14 firefighters. The current fire started on the
lower slopes and quickly engulfed residences at two mobile home
parks. It was reported around noon Saturday in the village of West
Glenwood Springs, and within hours the hills were ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of menacing smoke and flames, residents and visitors
rushed to evacuate long before authorities made the call.</TE>
<TE>   Richard M. Pappas described the scene: "Heavy smoke was coming in,
emergency vehicles were everywhere, the interstate was shut down and
traffic in town was bumper to bumper. No one knew which direction to
go. People just got out of their cars and began walking.... It was
panic."</TE>
<TE>   Pappas, the chief of security for the Hotel Colorado, said he
evacuated all of the hotel's 250 guests into city buses at 1:30 a.m.
Sunday. Pappas, a desk clerk, the head of housekeeping, two maids and
a chef remained to stand guard.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a place to sleep and the chef will cook for us," Pappas
said. "We're better off than most."</TE>

<HD>Ice Hockey Is Smokin' on Tobacco Road</HD>
<DH>Sports: The Carolina Hurricanes' trip to the Stanley Cup
finals has only strengthened the transplanted team's bond with fans
in Dixie.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>No, they don't think icing is something you drag your finger through
on a piece of cake.</LD>
<LD>   And you're not going to hear folks hanging around the arena
talking about hoisting a pig up on a spit during "halftime."</LD>
<LD>   Because here in the steamy heart of the Carolinas, land of
tobacco, NASCAR and college hoops, people get ice hockey--and like
it. And as Carolina's National Hockey League team, the Hurricanes,
vies for the Stanley Cup, the Snow Belt sport is shattering
stereotypes and winning converts. Thousands of them.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a woman, I'm a Southerner and I'm a Carolina fan," Raleigh
native Lucy Kindsvatter yelled above a cheering din as she waited for
the third game in the series to begin Saturday night. (The Detroit
Red Wings went on to win, 3-2, in triple overtime.) "But I love ice
hockey. It's doggone beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   All Hurricanes playoff games have sold out here. The city's
Entertainment and Sports Arena is generating the loudest crowds--and
the best tailgating--in the league. Southern kids are picking up
hockey sticks.</TE>
<TE>   And in a place with tribal-like loyalty to college basketball
teams, there's a growing acceptance of Canada's national pastime as a
real sport.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to get confused watching those guys on TV," said Raleigh
truck driver Ronald McClaim, "fighting for that, that ..."</TE>
<TE>   Puck?</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, puck. But you know, now I kinda like it."</TE>
<TE>   This pro sports success story springs from shrewd marketing, a
talented and spirited team and, more than anything else, a new
reality in the South: Yankee-fication.</TE>
<TE>   As good jobs and industries flow South, so do Northerners. Few
places exemplify this more than the Research Triangle area of
Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, where half the residents come from out of
state.</TE>
<TE>   The area is home to three major universities, a well-established
high-tech sector led by IBM and more PhDs per capita than just about
anywhere else in the country. "The Triangle" has attracted more
transplants than any Southern community except metro Atlanta (which
is twice its size).</TE>
<TE>   Cary, a Raleigh suburb, is so full of new faces that good ol' boys
say the name is short for Containment Area for Relocated Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   But when down South, the transplants do as Southerners do.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, there was an eerie lack of traffic leading into
Raleigh's arena in the hour before the game. Everybody was already
there.</TE>
<TE>   It was a spectacular day: 80 degrees, slight breeze, a Carolina
blue sky. And the parking lot was filled with thousands of
red-shirted Hurricane fans--from the North and South--eating chicken
wings, boiling clams, swigging Budweiser, blasting Lynyrd Skynyrd
from their stereos, whooping and hollering and splashing around in
kiddie swimming pools balanced in the beds of enormous pickup trucks
with "I am a Caniac!!!" painted on the sides.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a college atmosphere out there," said NHL Commissioner
Gary Bettman.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a sense of Southern manners. Many fans told stories
of chatting with their favorite players. The other day, Sherry
Hollcraft, who runs a house cleaning business in Raleigh, visited
with team captain Ron Francis and his wife in the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a lot of vegetables," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Gagnon, a newly minted hockey fan, went to the airport
Friday morning to welcome the team back after it lost Game 2 in
Detroit. There were 150 people waiting for the plane. No matter that
it was 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "They still signed autographs," Gagnon said. "Bless their hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Hockey stars as a whole have a reputation for being pretty down to
earth. Save for Wayne Gretzky, most are hardly blinked at outside
their hometowns.</TE>
<TE>   But for their part, the Hurricanes--whose logo features a puck as
the eye of the storm--have provided an excellent lesson in community
relations.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the Fans Happy</TE>
<TE>   The team markets special ticket packages for families, players
volunteer at charity events and management came up with a "contract
with fans," acknowledged as a little hokey but still successful. (The
contract outlined arena improvements and added foot-long hot dogs to
the concession stand menu.)</TE>
<TE>   This year, the team put up video screens in the parking lot so
fans without finals tickets (going for as much as $1,300) could watch
the game together for free.</TE>
<TE>   And so for the moment, the glaring dollar signs of professional
sports fade away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a cultural exchange out there," said Raleigh Mayor
Charles Meeker. "When we played Toronto [in the playoffs] we had
people cooking hot dogs together, drinking beer, learning the words
of the Canadian national anthem."</TE>
<TE>   The Hurricanes, who moved from Hartford, Conn., to North Carolina
in 1997, are trying hard to avoid the fate of the Charlotte Hornets.
Somehow, in an area known for great basketball, the state lost its
only NBA franchise after relations soured among owners, fans and city
leaders. The Hornets once boasted the best attendance in the league.
This year, they held playoff games in a half-full arena. Next season
they're off to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the Caniac spirit is that they're underdogs. They're down
2 games to 1 to the heavily favored Red Wings. But just getting to
the finals has been deemed a miracle for a team ranked 15th in the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the parking lot was sizzling with burgers, humming
with music and overflowing with a sun-sweetened spirit that seemed to
belong squarely in the South.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Jacques!" one guy yelled to a French Canadian TV journalist
doing a stand-up report. "Wanna brew?"</TE>
<TE>   The journalist smiled and shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen anything like this," said the journalist, whose
name is actually Rene Pothier, in a silky French accent. "We could
never have this in Montreal, this spirit, this much ambience."</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher John Beckham contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>In N.H., a House Divided Over GOP Senate Contest</HD>
<DH>Primary: Stakes are high because the outcome could decide
which party controls the chamber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>weekender/Williams</BD>
<DL>MANCHESTER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>A Republican family feud is ablaze in New Hampshire, and its sparks
are flying far beyond the tiny state.</LD>
<LD>   From Mississippi to Manhattan, well-known GOP politicians are
choosing sides in one of the year's most bitter Senate primaries.
Former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has weighed in. So has
former President Bush. His son, the current president, is sending
mixed signals: His chief political advisor is on one side, his chief
of staff on the other. Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.)
has a foot in both camps.</LD>
<LD>   The focus of all the fuss: Sen. Bob Smith, who is seeking a third
term, and Rep. John E. Sununu, a three-term House member trying to
grab the GOP's Senate nomination from Smith. Helping fuel Sununu's
challenge is anger at Smith among Republicans caused by his decision
to quit the party in 1999 to run for president as an independent.
Smith's bid quickly sputtered and he rejoined the GOP.</LD>
<TE>   The primary race is drawing national attention because New
Hampshire voters--who are accustomed to being kingmakers every four
years with their first-in-the-nation presidential primary--could well
decide in November which party controls the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, who hold the chamber by a single seat, see New
Hampshire as their best shot at ousting an incumbent Republican and
padding their margin. Conversely, holding on to the New Hampshire
seat could prove essential to GOP hopes of winning back control of
the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that the decision of a
few hundred thousand New Hampshire voters could determine the
national agenda for the next two years," Democratic National
Committee head Terry McAuliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats have a strong candidate in New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne
Shaheen, who faces no opposition for her party's nomination. The GOP
spat, meanwhile, won't be settled until a Sept. 10 primary--less than
two months before the general election.</TE>
<TE>   The choice between Smith and Sununu does not hinge on ideology:
Both are conservatives with similar voting records on most issues.
Instead, many Republicans here are focusing on who is best equipped
to win in November.</TE>
<TE>   "The real question is who is going to be more effective in the
race against Shaheen and in bringing the party together after the
primary," said lawyer Scott Earnshaw, an undecided voter who took
time on a recent Saturday to attend a barbecue to meet Sununu.</TE>
<TE>   Polls consistently have shown that Sununu would be the stronger
candidate against Shaheen, and that he is the favorite to win the
primary. Smith supporters dismiss poll numbers this far from the
primary and point to other measures of candidate strength.</TE>
<TE>   Smith has vastly outdistanced Sununu in campaign fund-raising. And
he has a core of committed supporters--especially among conservatives
drawn to his ardent defense of the rights of gun owners and his
opposition to abortion.</TE>
<TE>   "What does it take to win in New Hampshire? Grass roots and
financial resources," said Corey Lewandowski, Smith's campaign
director. "Bob Smith is the only candidate who has both."</TE>
<TE>   Winning back Republican control of the Senate is key for President
Bush, who has seen major elements of his agenda sail through the
GOP-run House only to bog down in the Senate. That's why he has been
aggressive this year in recruiting and campaigning for GOP candidates
for Senate seats.</TE>
<TE>   In some states, he has not hesitated to embrace a well-known
candidate facing long-shot opponents in a GOP primary--for example,
his backing of Elizabeth Hanford Dole, who is seeking an open Senate
seat in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   But in New Hampshire, the political calculations are far more
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Tradition would dictate that the White House and national party
officials support an incumbent seeking reelection. But the White
House and the GOP establishment have been sending mixed signals about
Smith. One complication involves family ties: Sununu's father was
chief of staff to Bush's father--although he was controversial and
eventually was fired.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's father threw his weight behind the younger Sununu last
summer, when he came here for a fund-raiser. And last month, Andrew
H. Card Jr., the current White House chief of staff, told local
reporters he favors Sununu.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had a long and close relationship with the Sununu family,"
said Card, who had been deputy to Sununu's father in the first Bush
administration.</TE>
<TE>   But weighing in for Smith has been Karl Rove, Bush's chief
political aide who traveled to New Hampshire last year to raise money
for the senator and proclaim the White House's commitment to
incumbents. More recently, Christie Whitman, head of the
Environmental Protection Agency, spent a day touring the state with
Smith, who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and
Public Works Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "For our agenda, he has been very important," Whitman said after
joining Smith to open a stretch of hiking trail.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Republicans also are split. Many have contributed to Smith;
most recently, Sen. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois sponsored a
fund-raiser for Smith in Chicago. But in an unusual departure from
the support lawmakers usually provide their colleagues, four GOP
senators this spring held a fund-raiser for Sununu at a Washington
restaurant. One of them was Lott, although he also has lent financial
support to Smith.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest splash was made by Giuliani's endorsement of Smith.
"He's experienced, effective and always puts principle before
politics," the former mayor said in a radio advertisement.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith's 1999 resignation from the party continues to rankle
some Republicans, especially those who recall the acrimonious speech
he made at the time. Accusing the GOP of abandoning core values, he
said, "The Republican platform is a meaningless document that has
been put out there for suckers."</TE>
<TE>   Smith came back to the GOP when he had the opportunity to become
chairman of the environment committee.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disillusioned," said Kevin Chalbeck, a former Smith
supporter who now backs Sununu. "I always thought he was principled."</TE>
<TE>   In his pitch to GOP voters as he campaigns around the state, Smith
emphasizes the importance of his Senate seniority and argues that it
is a "serious matter" for another Republican to throw him out.</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be a pretty good reason," Smith said at a recent
candidate forum in Manchester. "What have I not done? Where have I
not been there for you?"</TE>
<TE>   Sununu followed with his response. Without mentioning the
candidate by name, he implied that Smith was less likely to win.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot advocate [Bush's] priorities unless we have a
Republican majority in the Senate," Sununu said. "When I defeat
Jeanne Shaheen on Nov. 5, that's exactly what we are going to have."</TE>
<TE>   The forum also provided a glimpse of the rivals' contrasting
styles. Smith, 61, spoke in booming, emotional tones, citing his
support for antiabortion and pro-gun views. Sununu, 37, was more
low-key in his manner and presented himself as a pragmatic
problem-solver.</TE>
<TE>   Sununu's appeal to many voters reflects, in part, New Hampshire's
changing demographics. The state has been transformed by an influx of
younger, more moderate voters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the crusty, flinty, conservative Republican state that
it used to be," said Charles Cook, a Washington-based nonpartisan
political analyst.</TE>

<HD>Knowing Hard Choices Can Be Painful, Bush Dodges Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>

<LD>Nothing in politics is more difficult than taking the long view. For
politicians, distant gain is rarely a persuasive reason to endure
immediate pain. Political scientists would say the system has a bias
toward the present over the future. Parents might say politicians
behave like perpetual teenagers.</LD>
<LD>   The problem, for politicians as much as teenagers, is that the
future has a pesky habit of arriving. And, in politics as in life,
decisions deferred usually grow more difficult.</LD>
<LD>   That isn't exactly a state secret; almost everyone in Washington
understands it. Yet they rarely act on it. Politicians facing
election in two, four or six years don't have much incentive to
accept the pain of difficult decisions today when the consequences of
inaction won't come due for years--possibly on someone else sitting
in the chair they now hold.</LD>
<TE>   That mismatch between (short-term) costs and (long-term) benefits
largely explains why Washington has failed to act on slowly
compounding problems such as global warming or the unsustainable rise
in the cost of Medicare and Social Security. All would be easier to
confront if we imposed gradual changes today. But politicians have
recoiled from even modest steps that might incite a backlash today
and only produce benefits much later.</TE>
<TE>   That same reluctance to accept short-term pain has been shaping
the response to two other challenges confronting Washington: the
pre-Sept. 11 failures by the intelligence community and the fallout
from the collapse of Enron Corp. In each case, President Bush in
particular has appeared to place the highest priority on minimizing
his near-term political headaches. But in these instances, that
calculation may serve neither the national interest nor Bush's
self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   When problems gestate slowly enough--like global warming--the
national interest and political self-interest can diverge. The
country rarely benefits from delay, but politicians looking to
maximize their own chances of reelection often do.</TE>
<TE>   The difference on intelligence reorganization and corporate reform
is that the consequences of inaction could come due much quicker. It
could easily be Bush, not some future president, who pays the
heightened price of procrastination--a price measured in continued
vulnerability to terrorist attacks or sustained downward pressure on
the stock market. On intelligence reform, there were signs last week
that the White House was coming to understand this. On corporate
reform, it still appears to be missing the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since the first suspicions surfaced about FBI and CIA
failures before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the White House
response has been consistently myopic. Its instinct has been to view
the questions as the political threat to the president. So as the
first revelations of missed clues and miscommunication emerged, the
White House reserved its greatest outrage for the questioners. Vice
President Dick Cheney, showing a passion he hasn't yet mustered over
the breakdowns between the CIA and the FBI, denounced the most
pointed questions as "thoroughly irresponsible and totally unworthy
of national leaders in a time of war."</TE>
<TE>   What's become increasingly apparent, though, is that the threat to
the president isn't the questions but the intelligence failures that
provoked them. Polls don't give any indication that the missed clues
at the CIA and the FBI have appreciably undercut Bush's support. But
ultimately, the public--and history--are likely to judge Bush by his
success at preventing future attacks. And, while Americans have been
understandably reluctant to blame Bush for missteps occurring so soon
after he took office, voters in 2004 could be much less forgiving if
another attack exposes a failure to take sufficient steps after these
initial disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why, even on political grounds, focusing on the short
term may not make much sense for the White House. For the last month,
the dominant White House political goal has been to reduce the
visibility and scope of investigations focusing on pre-9/11
intelligence gathering. It has been especially determined to block
the appointment of an independent blue-ribbon commission.</TE>
<TE>   Does that really serve Bush's self-interest? It's true that the
more narrow and constrained the investigations, the smaller the
chance that the White House will face immediate turbulence over
embarrassing revelations. But the widest possible inquiry is arguably
in Bush's long-term interest because it has the greatest chance of
unearthing the problems that could contribute to another attack--and
creating a political climate in which it's possible to correct them.
Already, without the revelations of failures at agencies from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to the FBI, it's difficult to
imagine that Bush would have a chance at passing a reorganization
nearly as bold as his new proposal to create a Cabinet-level
Department of Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   On Enron-related issues, the administration has been equally
shortsighted, with active encouragement from the business community.
Last winter, when Enron was dominating the headlines, Bush joined the
chorus of outrage and promised reform. But the administration's
accounting and corporate governance proposals were tepid, and it
hasn't lifted a finger as intense business lobbying has reduced the
odds that Congress will pass any changes to discourage more
balance-sheet manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   Deadlock might be a short-term victory for an administration
resistant to new government regulation. But it ignores a larger cost
to the country and to Bush. Over the last week, the chief executives
of IBM and the investment bank Goldman Sachs have warned that
flagging faith in corporate honesty was spooking investors and
depressing the stock market. "I cannot think of a time when business
overall has been held in less repute," said Henry M. Paulson Jr. of
Goldman Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   Putting his shoulder behind serious corporate and accounting
reform would undoubtedly create short-term tensions for Bush with his
business allies. But he probably has more to fear from a sustained
slump in the stock market that erodes voter optimism about the
economy, just as he has far more to fear from future intelligence
failures than from the excavation of old ones. As he charts his
course on intelligence reorganization and corporate reform, Bush may
well find that avoiding pain now is the best way to guarantee it
later.</TE>

<LD>Hundreds of thousands of people turned out Sunday along Manhattan's
Fifth Avenue to express their Puerto Rican pride mixed with American
patriotism in honor of those killed Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   In a city with a Puerto Rican population of nearly 800,000,
politicians were among many dignitaries who participated. This year,
the parade's grand marshal was Nicholas Estavillo, who is Puerto
Rican and chief of patrol for New York City police.</LD>
<LD>   "They are commemorating the parade to the victims of the World
Trade Center," he said. Angel Gonzalez, 25, said he lost a friend in
the attack and wanted to attend the parade in part to honor
firefighters and police officers.</LD>
<TE>   "It's more important now than ever," said Gonzalez, wearing a
bandanna in the design of the Puerto Rican flag.</TE>
<TE>   No incidents were reported as the parade was underway.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Was Job 4 in Phoenix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Months before an FBI agent here warned of extremists attending U.S.
flight schools, anti-terrorism efforts in the Phoenix office had
virtually ground to a halt when a surveillance unit was disbanded and
agents assigned to counter-terrorism were diverted to an arson case,
according to current and former FBI agents.</LD>
<LD>   The actions reflected the low-priority status given by FBI
management here to anti-terrorism investigations before the Sept. 11
attacks on the East Coast, agents said in recent interviews.</LD>
<LD>   Even now, some say, the office's attention and resources to
preventing terrorism remain inadequate.</LD>
<TE>   "If people only knew," said one agent who spoke on condition of
anonymity. "They think [agents] are really out there making progress,
but they are not being allowed to do what they need to do."</TE>
<TE>   Guadalupe Gonzalez, special agent in charge of the Phoenix FBI
office, acknowledged Friday that, before Sept. 11, international
terrorism ranked fourth in his office's list of priorities behind
organized crime and drugs, white-collar crime and crime on Indian
reservations. That clearly has changed since the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, with international terrorism
seen as the priority, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Gonzalez rejected the notion that his office's anti-terrorism
efforts have been compromised by staffing decisions involving
surveillance or the local arson case.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think those events were detractors in any way from what
we were able to do in Phoenix," Gonzalez said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent interviews, however, current and former FBI agents
criticized the decision to assign the office's international
terrorism squad to the full-time investigation of an "eco-arsonist"
who torched luxury homes in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas from
April 2000 to January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not terrorism," one agent said. "This was some [guy]
burning down homes."</TE>
<TE>   Among the half a dozen or so international terrorism agents
assigned for months to the arson investigation was Kenneth Williams,
who wrote the July warning memo to FBI headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Although Williams declined to comment Friday, sources say his memo
last year was the result of months of monitoring Islamic extremists
attending flight schools in Arizona beginning in early 2000. Records
and interviews also show that at least one of the 19 Sept. 11
hijackers, Hani Hanjour, was living in the state as early as 1996 and
returned in January 2001. At that time, the arson investigation still
was underway.</TE>
<TE>   Current and former agents say it was stunning that agents assigned
to international terrorism--or IT, as they call it--would be diverted
to an arson investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Kenny's expertise is in international terrorism, not arson or
general property crimes," former agent Jim Hauswirth said. "And it is
just unbelievable that we would take one of the premier IT
investigators in the bureau and put him on a local arson case with
the history of Islamic terrorism here in Phoenix."</TE>
<TE>   A current agent added: "There were no terrorism investigations
taking place for several months during 2000 and 2001. Cases were
open, but nothing was being done."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez insisted Friday that the Joint Terrorism Task Force
agents assigned to the arson case were not prevented from continuing
work on their other cases.</TE>
<TE>   "They were part of our counter-terrorism squad and that is what
the squad does," he said, describing the arson case as a type of
counter-terrorism investigation into what was a "very significant
crime."</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that Phoenix FBI management also erred in
disbanding its so-called Special Operations Group surveillance squad
in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, surveillance of potential terrorists resumed,
using agents borrowed from Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a surveillance team, it is traditionally assigned to
headquarters division," said former agent Hauswirth, who spent 16 of
his 27 years with the FBI assigned to Special Operations Groups in
Phoenix and Philadelphia. "And it doesn't make sense not to have your
surveillance assets assigned to the headquarters."</TE>
<TE>   In December, Hauswirth wrote a scathing letter to FBI headquarters
in Washington complaining that management of the Phoenix office had
given anti-terrorism "the lowest investigative priority."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez defended the decision to disband the Phoenix surveillance
team, saying that budget cuts last year forced the office to reduce
staffing by 10 positions.</TE>
<TE>   Critics counter that the FBI has been spending thousands of extra
dollars a day to house and feed the agents from the Tucson office.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since 9/11, these poor guys have been taken out of Tucson,
moved away from their families, and assigned to Phoenix at great
expense to the taxpayers," said Susan Via, a former assistant U.S.
attorney in Arizona whose husband is an FBI agent.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not saying they should always have kept the surveillance
team intact. But once Sept. 11 happened and it became apparent they
would need a full-time surveillance team back, why would you drag up
agents from Tucson to work that assignment?" said Via, who began her
career as a federal prosecutor in Boston with now-FBI Director Robert
S. Mueller III.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said he doesn't believe that the decision to do away with
the surveillance team hurt counter-terrorism efforts in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, the Phoenix surveillance squad may be reassembled
soon.</TE>
<TE>   Several current and former Phoenix agents say it will take far
more to turn the office around.</TE>
<TE>   "The morale here is as bad as I've ever seen it anywhere," said a
veteran FBI agent who also spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>

<HD>Senators Urge Flexibility in Bush's Plan to Expand Cabinet</HD>
<DH>Politics: His proposal for homeland security must foster
cooperation among agencies, Lieberman says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers on Sunday warned President Bush that his
plans for a new Homeland Security Department may need extensive
revision and said more would have to be done to improve
intelligence-sharing between the FBI and the CIA.</LD>
<LD>   The president's plan does not address problems at the two
agencies, said Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior
Republican on the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, which
has been probing intelligence failures that occurred before the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks. "Absolutely not," he said. "It doesn't address
those.... We are going to need the help of this administration to
change a lot of things structurally and otherwise with these huge
bureaucracies that I believe are not agile--do not, in all occasions,
serve us well today."</LD>
<LD>   "I think we need something stronger" to force more cooperation
between the FBI and CIA, said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.),
chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. He said that
"what most infuriates and aggravates us ... is the absolute failure
of the intelligence community to share information with the law
enforcement community, and vice versa. If that had happened, I still
think we had a chance to prevent Sept. 11."</LD>
<TE>   Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), chairman of the intelligence committee,
warned that "if the administration takes the stonewall position that
every word in their plan is biblical and if you change it you're
unpatriotic, I think that will be a very serious error."</TE>
<TE>   Bush last week called for a new Cabinet-level Department of
Homeland Security, an idea also proposed by several members of
Congress, including Lieberman. The department would include several
border control agencies--including the Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs
Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service--as well as
other security-related offices, such as the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory, the Secret Service and the newly created
Transportation Security Administration. It would have almost 170,000
employees and a budget of more than $37 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers' comments came as the White House continued its
public relations offensive Sunday to win support for the new
department. Tom Ridge, the president's chief of homeland security,
appeared on three talk shows, while chief of staff Andrew H. Card Jr.
was on two.</TE>
<TE>   The new department would analyze intelligence from the FBI and the
CIA, although it would not gather information itself. Neither agency
would be part of the new department. Critics have said the agencies
failed to "connect the dots" of data uncovered by their own agents
that, pieced together, might have given clues to the coming Sept. 11
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the FBI has been embarrassed by reports that as early
as July, an agent in Phoenix wrote a memo stating concerns about
possible agents of Osama bin Laden taking lessons at American flight
schools. A Minneapolis agent, Coleen Rowley, told Congress last week
that FBI officials in Washington had hampered efforts by field agents
in her office during the summer to investigate one such
suspect--Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   Graham and Shelby, appearing on CBS' "Face the Nation," said their
inquiry was turning up additional CIA and FBI intelligence lapses
that preceded Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already getting significant numbers of people coming to
us, either in person or with materials that hadn't previously been
known," Graham said. "I think the testimony of Ms. Rowley has given
encouragement to folks" who have information about the performance of
the intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby said that more examples of the agencies' failure to share
information would become public. "And I would add to that NSA and
other members of the intelligence community," he noted, referring to
the National Security Agency, which collects foreign communications
and signals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to find that there's a lot of missed opportunities,
and a lot of it will go back to lack of sharing of information," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bush administration officials said the Homeland Security
Department would aim to ensure that important intelligence did not
get lost in the federal bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Card said on "Fox News Sunday" that if the proposed department had
been in place, "I think there would have been a better chance" that
hints of the attacks might have surfaced. "It would be good to have
... another place where people can look at the dots to see how they
might be connected."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the new department, Lieberman, on the same show,
recommended establishing a counter-terrorism advisor to the president
to coordinate the intelligence work of the FBI, CIA, State Department
and Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge said administration officials had considered creating a role
for the FBI within the new department, "but ultimately the decision
was made that it should remain a critical component of the attorney
general's office" because of its law-enforcement responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI does more than worry about terrorist attacks," Card said
on ABC's "This Week." "And besides, we did not want to create a
Homeland Security Department that would look like the old Soviet-era
... ministry of the interior. This is a Homeland Security Department
that will secure the homeland."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers said they presumed that Ridge would lead the new
department, although Bush has not announced his choice.</TE>

<HD>Space Fills Void Aerogel Created</HD>
<DH>Material: The light, strong compound was born in the 1930s.
Now extraterrestrial projects will put the 'solution waiting for a
problem' to test.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Able to stop a speeding bullet! More insulating than ordinary
fiberglass! So lightweight it's almost as light as air!</LD>
<LD>   For some space applications, scientists can't rely on man or
steel. Instead, it's aerogel to the rescue.</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes called "solid smoke" because of its extraordinarily low
density and the bluish cast it takes when light shines on it,
aerogels once were little more than a scientific curiosity.</LD>
<TE>   The material, created in the 1930s, is made of silicon dioxide,
the basic material in glass. It is extremely light and strong--able
to support more than 4,000 times its own weight. One variety of
aerogel developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory holds the Guinness
record for world's least dense solid, weighing in at 3 milligrams per
cubic centimeter.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, aerogels are excellent thermal insulators, can
withstand wild temperature fluctuations and resist the effects of
ultraviolet light.</TE>
<TE>   "It has all these unique properties all wrapped up into one
material all at once," said Steven Jones, the scientist at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory who developed the Guinness record version.
"It's a solution waiting for a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Space exploration has supplied the problems. The characteristics
of aerogel, to take one example, make it the perfect candidate to go
where no space mission has gone before: to the tail of a comet.</TE>
<TE>   Stardust, an unmanned spacecraft launched in 1999, will use
aerogel to capture fragile dust from the tail of Comet Wild-2 in
2004. Scientists predict the aerogel will trap particles as small as
1/50 the width of a human hair moving six times faster than a rifle
bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Aerogels have other uses in space exploration. Consider
insulation. When engineers set out to design a rover to survey the
surface of Mars, they found the machine was several kilograms too
heavy. Using lightweight aerogels for the insulation solved the
problem. The materials also will be used on two larger Mars vehicles
that are planned.</TE>
<TE>   What is it about aerogel that gives it those amazing properties?</TE>
<TE>   It's a solid foam, said Sidney Perkowitz, professor at Emory
University in Atlanta and author of "Universal Foam: From Cappuccino
to the Cosmos" (Walker &amp; Co., 2000).</TE>
<TE>   A foam, says Perkowitz, is simply open spaces of one kind of
material embedded in another material. Swiss cheese, for example, is
a solid foam. Meringues and souffles also owe their light and airy
textures to a foamy structure.</TE>
<TE>   Foams have unique properties that are different from their
individual parts, Perkowitz said. Soap suds offer an example. "Air is
transparent, water is transparent," he said. "You mix both together,
and light behaves differently."</TE>
<TE>   Aerogels have a microscopic ''open-pore'' design, reminiscent of a
sponge or a net, which makes the materials only slightly denser than
air.</TE>
<TE>   To make aerogels, scientists mix liquid silica with a solvent to
form a Jell-O-like solid. Scientists then remove the solvent using
extreme heat and pressure to preserve the gel network.</TE>
<TE>   The structure of aerogel interferes with the way the substance
transfers light, sound and thermal energy. Although 99% of the mass
of an aerogel is made of air filling its empty pores, each individual
pore is so small it prevents the air molecules within it from
interacting with other molecules.</TE>
<TE>   On Stardust's mission to Wild-2 (pronounced "vilt," after its
Swedish discoverer), blocks of aerogel arrayed in a honeycomb-like
tray on a collector shaped like a tennis racket will trap dust
particles from the comet's tail. After making a couple of swings
around Earth, Stardust will fly within 93 miles of Comet Wild-2 in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   The aerogel will act like shrink-wrap to preserve the particles'
original "fluffy" shape and chemical composition, said Peter Tsou, a
deputy investigator for the project.</TE>
<TE>   Each bit of dust will carve a track shaped something like a carrot
into the block of aerogel, melting the material and encasing itself
in a little glass shell. Other cushiony materials such as polystyrene
would disintegrate into a powder when exposed to ultraviolet light in
space, Tsou said.</TE>
<TE>   When Stardust returns home in 2006, researchers will extract the
particles for study.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining the original structure and composition is important,
Tsou said, just as they are to an archeologist excavating a site. If
you were a researcher, "would you prefer a chip of a vase or a bottle
of atoms of a vase?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Comets essentially are hunks of ice and rock that are left over
from the solar system's formation, so analyzing the comet dust "will
tell us about the start of the solar system," said Donald Brownlee, a
University of Washington professor and the primary investigator of
the mission.</TE>
<TE>   But not just any comet dust will do.</TE>
<TE>   "More importantly, we want fresh comet," Tsou said.</TE>
<TE>   Kept in the deep freeze far away from the sun, comets retain their
original primordial compositions. But when some gravitational
disturbance knocks them out of their distant orbits and sends them
plunging toward the sun, each pass they make through the inner solar
system melts some of the solids and ice. Wild-2 is ideal for the
mission, as it has made only a few orbits.</TE>
<TE>   The aerogel collector also will bring back clues about stars
outside of our solar system by collecting interstellar dust.
Scientists believe tons of the stuff rains down on the planet every
year, but its composition changes as it burns through the atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   While aerogel is invaluable for such scientific missions, the
materials, as yet, have few commercial applications.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers have studied aerogels' potential use in windows. The
foam diffracts light, however, bending rays rather than allowing them
to pass straight through as glass does.</TE>
<TE>   Also, aerogels need to be handled with care. Although able to
support great weights, the material is fragile enough to shatter in
the grip of a human hand unless pressure is applied evenly.</TE>
<TE>   It also is difficult to mass produce, Jones said. "You can't make
it on a conveyor belt."</TE>
<TE>   One company, Boston-based Cabot Corp., plans to launch custom
insulation products this fall using a particle version of aerogel.
The material could be used to fill the space between double-pane
glass, for example, providing diffuse light with as much insulation
as an opaque wall.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of interest in energy-efficient ways to bring
daylight into places," said David Kaul, manager of Cabot's aerogel
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Aspen Aerogels in western Massachusetts developed aerogel blankets
with a number of uses, including insulation for wrapping pipes or
even to reduce the infrared emissions of Army helicopters, said Chris
Blair, director of sales and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   It also is used for extreme-weather clothing. Corpo Nove, an
Italian clothing design company, began using Aspen blankets to line
jackets in 1999, said Susan Clowe, spokeswoman for the company. The
lining provides three times the warmth of Thinsulate, but the jackets
cost more than $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   And don't think you'll want to snuggle directly under an aerogel
blanket any time soon. The material has many amazing properties, but
comfort is not one of them. A blanket of aerogel "leaves a horrible
feeling on your skin," Clowe said. "It has to be encased between two
other layers."</TE>

<LD>Question: Why do you have to use different appliances for natural gas
and liquid petroleum gas?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Natural gas, which is drawn directly from the ground, is
almost pure methane. LPG, which is produced in the distillation of
crude oil, contains mainly propane, which has a much higher energy
density. A cubic foot of natural gas yields about 1,000 BTUs of
energy, while a similar volume of LPG yields about 2,500 BTUs. The
burners for appliances using LPG must thus have smaller holes to
achieve the same amount of heat release. If LPG is used in appliances
designed for natural gas, the appliances will overheat, with
potentially disastrous results.</LD>

<LD>El Nino, the weather phenomenon that can trigger deadly droughts and
floods, could arrive as early as July and reach its full devastating
intensity by the end of the year, according to a U.S. government
weather expert. Telltale signs of a nascent El Nino already can be
seen in South America, where the worst storms in 100 years hit Chile
last week.</LD>

<HD>Transplant Drug Helps Keep Arteries Clear</HD>

<BD>Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A transplant drug called sirolimus can prevent newly cleared arteries
from reclogging--at least for six months, according to French
researchers. When clogged arteries are reopened using balloon
angioplasty, surgeons typically insert stents--coiled wires--to keep
them open. The stents help, but they are not 100% effective. The
French team used a new stent that is coated with sirolimus, which has
been shown to inhibit cell division and suppress an immune response.</LD>
<LD>   The team from Institut Cardiovasculaire Paris Sud reported in the
Thursday New England Journal of Medicine that it performed
angioplasty on 238 patients; half were given uncoated stents and half
were given stents coated with sirolimus. After six months, the
arteries had reclogged in 27% of the patients receiving the uncoated
stents, but in none of those receiving the coated ones.</LD>

<LD>Cholera bacteria appear to become even more infectious as they pass
through the human intestinal tract, a finding that could help explain
why the Third World disease spreads so quickly, researchers say. At
the same time, the finding complicates efforts to develop a vaccine,
since most research uses laboratory-grown strains that are apparently
less infectious than those that have gone through a person, said Dr.
Andrew Camilli of the Tufts University School of Medicine, who
reported the finding in the Thursday issue of Nature.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks ago, I received a voicemail message that put a smile on
my face a light-year long. The words tumbling out of the machine
could barely contain my friend's excitement; he sounded, in fact, a
lot like a child who had just got home from school and couldn't wait
to tell you that butterflies come from caterpillars or that worms can
grow their heads back after you cut them off.</LD>
<LD>   Except that my friend is 90 years old, today, and Walter wasn't
calling about worms. He was calling about images he'd seen in The
Times from the newly refurbished Hubble Space Telescope.</LD>
<LD>   "They have actually made a picture 120 million light-years away!"
he said in a voice still charmingly tinged with his native Vienna.
"That's enough to floor you. It takes my speech away. It's the most
important thing that happens today. I'm very happy to have heard
this."</LD>
<TE>   I too had seen the Hubble pictures. But until I heard from Walter,
I had forgotten to be properly amazed.</TE>
<TE>   There ought to be a law, I thought. One simply shouldn't be
allowed to take such things for granted. Perusing the week's papers,
I quickly found a whole new collection of compulsory jaw droppers.
Some scientists discovered fossil footprints of foot-long "bugs" that
had crawled onto dry land from the sea 480 million years ago; others
found a new form of life a mere 400-billionth of a meter in diameter,
existing improbably in a roiling undersea vent; still others
discovered what they think might be a huge reservoir of water on
Mars. If there's water, was there life? Is Mom a Martian?</TE>
<TE>   A study showed that, genetically speaking, mice and men are barely
distinguishable. A telescope produced a detailed image of the
universe as it looked 14 billion years ago. The cover of the journal
Science featured an image of four-dimensional sheets of space-time
floating toward each other like tissues in the wind, preparing to
collide and create a universe.</TE>
<TE>   The universe seems to demand that we stay in a state of continual
astonishment. Certainly it is an important quality for scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Take the case of another man who celebrates his 90th birthday this
year, Princeton physicist John Archibald Wheeler. He coined the terms
"black hole" and "quantum foam" and now spends his days working on
the question of why the universe exists.</TE>
<TE>   Talking with a reporter recently, he stopped in the midst of
contemplating the connection between reality and thought to ponder a
rock. "That rock is about 200 million years old," he said. "One
revolution of our galaxy."</TE>
<TE>   It's harder than you might think to keep such things in proper
focus, given the way our minds work. Anything we look at long enough
tends to disappear. This can be a difficult effect to notice, because
our eyes constantly jitter around, shaking up images imperceptibly,
creating a kind of continual visual surprise. If your eyes stayed
fixed, the visual world would begin to melt into a blurry palette of
vague shapes.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of other senses. Whatever drones on long enough
goes unheard (if it doesn't put you to sleep first). We don't feel
our shoes until we take them off. The bathtub water stops feeling
hot, and we stop noticing (if we're lucky) the power lines in the
yard.</TE>
<TE>   It's called adaptation, and we're pretty good at it.</TE>
<TE>   It keeps us from getting overwhelmed with information, but it also
can make us blind. Before we know it, even science writers forget
just how remarkable it is to take a picture of an object in the sky
millions of light-years away. Whatever it is, is much changed
now--whatever "now" means at such a distance.</TE>
<TE>   It occurred to me (and I'm certainly not the first) that
scientists can be a surprisingly childlike species. Walter is a
retired inventor and engineer who dreamed up some of the fancy
optical devices used at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the subject is stars or bones or molecules or
10-dimensional space-time or just great big beautiful machines,
scientists are just like kids showing off--sometimes shoving in front
of the other kids to get attention. (Beyond getting a driver's
license, what's the point of growing up, anyway?)</TE>
<TE>   Don Herbert, television's Mr. Wizard, once told me that he had to
use younger and younger children for his program, because once they
hit puberty, they become too self-conscious to let their curiosity
just hang out. As they get older, it becomes hard for them to ask
those deceptively innocent questions, such as the ones Wheeler
wonders about: Is the universe here (or there) when nobody's looking
at it? Wheeler thinks not. What's more, he thinks that the act of
looking is what brings the universe into existence.</TE>
<TE>   So, here's looking at you, Walter.</TE>
<TE>   And happy birthday.</TE>

<LD>By the time David Eckstein reached second base, he was in the Angel
record book, this time for hitting baseballs instead of getting hit
by them.</LD>
<LD>   By the time he looked up and saw third-base umpire Paul Schrieber
twirling his finger, singling home run, on-deck batter Darin Erstad
was shaking his head.</LD>
<LD>   By the time Eckstein got back to the dugout, the Angels were
massed at the steps, waiting to congratulate him on his 331-foot chip
shot.</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein's second-inning grand slam--his major league high third
this season--put the Angels on the road to a 7-4 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds to again move within a game of first-place Seattle in
the American League West.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis gutted out 6 1/3 innings. Adam Kennedy continued
his hot hitting with a two-run triple. The bullpen teetered, with Al
Levine giving up three runs in the ninth, and Troy Percival had to
come in to restore order, picking up his 13th save.</TE>
<TE>   But what the 35,501 at Edison Field will remember is one swing by
the Angels' diminutive shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't say enough about how that guy plays the game,"
Erstad said. "The only thing I don't like is there are no baserunners
left when I get up."</TE>
<TE>   The three grand slams tied an Angel single-season record, set by
Joe Rudi in 1978 and 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Eckstein looks more "Rudy" than Rudi.</TE>
<TE>   If there is one player in baseball above suspicion in the growing
steroid debate, it's Eckstein. He is generously listed as being 5
feet 8 and 170 pounds. His skills lean more toward getting on base by
any means necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe if I start hitting them 20 rows up, then you can start
questioning me about that," said Eckstein, as he flexed his right
arm.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein set an Angel and major league record for rookies by being
hit by 21 pitches last season. He is the American League leader this
season, having been hit 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein got the Angels started Sunday in the first inning. He
sliced a triple into the right-field corner, then scored on Erstad's
ground out. In the second, Tim Salmon singled, then was forced out on
Orlando Palmeiro's ground out. Bengie Molina singled and Kennedy
walked, setting the stage for Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   With the count 1-and-1, he broke his bat fouling off a pitch. He
sent pitcher Joey Hamilton's next pitch down the left-field line,
where it was caught by a fan in the first row.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't surprised that he hit a home run," Hamilton said. "It
doesn't take a power-hitter to hit a hanging slider out down the
left-field line."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, though, was surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I was rounding second base and looked up and saw the umpire
motioning," said Eckstein, who has three hits in seven at-bats with
the bases loaded. "I didn't know if it was a home run or a
ground-rule double.</TE>
<TE>   "Any home run I hit is by accident. I'm definitely not up there
trying to hit one.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to get a hit in that situation."</TE>
<TE>   The view from the dugout was different.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit the ball and you knew," Schoeneweis said. "He gets that
inside pitch and he takes his shot. He works so hard that good things
happen for him. Last year, we all talked about how he was the perfect
rookie."</TE>
<TE>   Perfect was hardly the word for Schoeneweis on Sunday, yet he came
away with his fourth consecutive victory.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis labored from the start Sunday. Barry Larkin singled
and Juan Encarnacion walked to start the game. But Schoeneweis got
Sean Casey to ground into a double play and Adam Dunn to fly out.</TE>
<TE>   It was that way much of the game for Schoeneweis, yet he gave up
only one run. The Angels helped out with three double plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I made good pitches when I had to," Schoeneweis said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are days when you don't have your best stuff out there.
Those are the days that make or break your season. You have to dig
deep."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was a little easier when Eckstein goes deep.</TE>

<HD>Bullpen Has Tough Time Closing the Deal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The dark lining in the Angels' silver cloud Sunday was their bullpen.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels took a 7-1 lead into the ninth inning, but reliever Al
Levine couldn't close the game. He gave up three runs and left with
runners on first and second with two out. Closer Troy Percival,
pitching for the fifth time in seven days, had to finish, but even he
gave up a two-run single.</LD>
<LD>   Levine, Ben Weber and Lou Pote have struggled in recent outings.</LD>
<TE>   "We have had some guys get nicked up lately, but it is not a major
concern for us," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "We have a lot of
confidence in our bullpen. We have some guys down there scuffling
right now. But they will get it back."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the bullpen is one area General Manager Bill Stoneman may
look to upgrade to help the Angels challenge the Seattle Mariners for
the West Division title. Another bat for the bench or a first baseman
with some power also could help. But seeing needs and filling them
are different things entirely.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more money is getting in the way," Stoneman said. "You
don't see the deals where you trade three young players for an
established player as much. You trade contract for contract."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, who sat out the previous two games with a mildly
strained right hamstring, returned to the lineup and played right
field.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon beat out an infield hit in his first at-bat. He doubled in
the sixth inning and was removed for pinch-runner Julio Ramirez.</TE>
<TE>   "If felt all right," Salmon said. "I didn't expect to be 100%. You
choose situations carefully. The only play I was tested on was the
base hit and I governed it a little."</TE>

<HD>Rangers Decide They Need Rocker Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Rocker was called up from the minor leagues by the Texas Rangers
and was in uniform for Sunday night's game against his former team,
the Atlanta Braves. However, he was not used in the Rangers' 9-3
loss.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker was promoted a day after Ranger closer Hideki Irabu gave up
Andruw Jones' three-run home run in the 10th inning of a 6-3 loss.
Irabu has yielded seven homers in his last four games.</LD>
<LD>   "I was pretty mad when they told me to go down to work on some
stuff," Rocker said. "Looking back, it was probably the best thing
that could happen. Gradually over a two-week period, I was able to
piece it back together, a 180-degree turnaround. My confidence is as
high as it's ever been."</LD>
<TE>   Rocker was 0-1 with a 7.53 earned-run average and one save in 17
relief appearances with the Rangers before he was sent to triple-A
Oklahoma for the second time this season May 21. While there, he was
1-0 with a 0.00 ERA in 8 2/3 innings, striking out 14 and walking
two.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Manager Jerry Narron didn't declare Rocker the closer,
saying instead he planned a bullpen-by-committee approach based on
matchups.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees put rookie outfielder Juan Rivera, who has a
fractured right kneecap, on the 15-day disabled list and said that
closer Mariano Rivera could follow in the next few days because of a
strained right groin.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star reliever was not available to pitch Sunday, and Steve
Karsay saved the 4-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Yankee
Manager Joe Torre said Mariano Rivera, who is not related to Juan,
will sit out a three-game series against Arizona that starts tonight.
But Torre wasn't sure if his closer would be put on the disabled
list.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now I think we're going to give it three or four days and
see what happens," Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Rivera ran into a golf cart while shagging flies during
batting practice Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Cubs traded catcher Robert Machado to the Milwaukee
Brewers for minor league outfielder Jackson Melian. The Cubs
announced the deal after a 5-1 victory at Seattle. Machado did not
play in the game. He hit .276 with one home run and five runs batted
in in 58 at-bats this season. He also threw out nine of 18 runners
who tried to steal against him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Luke Prokopec of the Toronto Blue Jays will skip his
next start because of a sore right elbow. Right-hander Brandon Lyon
will replace Prokopec in Tuesday's game against San Francisco.
Prokopec, acquired in the off-season from the Dodgers for reliever
Paul Quantrill and infielder Cesar Izturis, is 2-7 with a 5.86 ERA.</TE>

<HD>Safeco Field No Problem for Sosa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't take Sammy Sosa any time to figure out Seattle's Safeco
Field.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa hit his major league-leading 22nd home run and Jon Lieber
pitched the Chicago Cubs past the Seattle Mariners, 5-1, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa played for the National League All-Stars last summer at
Safeco Field, which has a reputation for being a pitcher's park.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a beautiful ballpark and these are great fans," Sosa said.
"This is one of the places that I feel very, very comfortable in. The
gaps are a little deep, but the balls jump down the line."</TE>
<TE>   Lieber (4-4) blanked the Mariners until Desi Relaford hit a
run-scoring single with two out in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs held Ichiro Suzuki, who leads the majors with a .369
batting average, to one hit in 12 at-bats in the series. His batting
average dropped 15 points in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 8, New York Mets 3--Rookie Ryan Drese (6-4) shut out the
Mets for 5 2/3 innings and Omar Vizquel had two more runs batted in
to help the Indians salvage the finale of a three-game series at
Jacobs Field. Vizquel had a two-run single in a five-run fourth,
giving him 39 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago White Sox 13, Montreal 2--Magglio Ordonez drove in six
runs to tie a career high, leading Mark Buehrle (9-4) and the White
Sox at Comiskey Park. Ordonez had three hits, including two doubles,
as the White Sox finally got offensive. They averaged three runs in
their last 13 games.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 3, Colorado 2--Rookie Joe Lawrence's sacrifice fly capped
a two-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Blue Jays
completed a three-game sweep and improved to 6-1 under new Manager
Carlos Tosca. The Rockies fell to a major league-worst 25-42 in six
seasons of interleague play, including 8-27 away from Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 9, Tampa Bay 6--Julius Matos hit his first major league
home run and drove in four runs to lead the Padres at St. Petersburg,
Fla. He had a three-run homer in the second--in only his 11th big
league at-bat since being called up from triple-A Portland on May 30.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 7, Detroit 5--Brandon Duckworth (3-4) won for the
first time in six starts and Pat Burrell drove in two runs with a
double and a triple as the Phillies completed their first road sweep
of the season, winning three in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 3, St. Louis 2--Raul Ibanez led off the bottom of the
ninth inning with a home run into the right-field bullpen against
reliever Mike Timlin (1-3) and the Royals avoided their first series
sweep by the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 7, Houston 6--Miguel Tejada hit a tiebreaking home run in
the bottom of the eighth inning and the Athletics completed a
three-game sweep of the Astros. Tejada drove in four runs as the
Athletics won their fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 9, Texas 3--Javy Lopez drove in four runs, one more than
he had in his last 19 games, and the Braves extended their
season-best winning streak to six games. The Braves became only the
second NL team to sweep a series in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 6, Minnesota 3--Derrek Lee homered twice and Mike Lowell
drove in three runs as the Marlins avoided a three-game sweep at the
Metrodome.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Milwaukee 4--The Pirates swept the three-game series
and are 6-0 against the Brewers this year. They are 12-1 in two
seasons at PNC Park against Milwaukee and have beaten the Brewers in
nine consecutive games overall.</TE>

<HD>Time to Savor Sarava</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: McPeek has never saddled a winner who paid as
much as improbable Belmont victor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Asked Sunday morning at Belmont Park whether he placed any bets
Saturday on Sarava, trainer Ken McPeek turned sheepish and
acknowledged a small $10 win-place wager.</LD>
<LD>   That's a ticket that's worth $962.50, but it's money that's going
to stay with the track.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think I'll ever cash it," said McPeek, who checked out
his longshot Belmont Stakes winner and shipped him back to his barn
at Churchill Downs. Paying $142.50, $50 and $22.40 across the board,
Sarava accounted for the highest win price in Belmont Stakes history
and gave McPeek his first Triple Crown win.</LD>
<TE>   McPeek may have lost Harlan's Holiday, who was sent to another
trainer, Todd Pletcher, three days before the Belmont, but he still
goes into the second half of the year with a double-barreled threat.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek's other top colt, Repent, won the Louisiana Derby before an
ankle chip knocked him out of the Triple Crown. Repent will be back
soon, either next month in the Haskell at Monmouth Park or in August
in the Jim Dandy at Saratoga.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek indicated that he would try to keep Sarava and Repent--who
have different owners--apart as much as possible.</TE>
<TE>   McPeek said that he has never saddled a winner who paid as much as
Sarava to win. Before a record Belmont Park crowd of 103,222, Sarava
dismantled the Triple Crown aspirations of War Emblem, whose
stumbling start led to an eighth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   "War Emblem's still done an awful lot, winning the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness," McPeek said, when asked about the status of the
3-year-old division. "We probably won't know about the [3-year-old]
championship until these horses start running against older horses
later in the year. But I've got a couple that might be able to knock
off War Emblem again."</TE>
<TE>   Sarava had run seven times--three in England, four in the
U.S.--before making his stakes debut with a win in the Sir Barton, a
minor race at Pimlico, on Preakness day three weeks ago. The
$1-million Belmont was his first attempt in a graded race.</TE>
<TE>   "He had never danced this big of a dance," McPeek said. "It was as
if I tossed him into the deep end of the pool and said, 'Hey, kid,
swim or sink.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bob Baffert, who trains War Emblem, is likely to give his horse a
rest before turning his attention to the second half of the campaign.
The Belmont was War Emblem's fourth important race in two months.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope to reload and be back [in the Triple Crown] next year,"
Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   Baffert had won four consecutive Triple Crown races--last year's
Preakness and Belmont with Point Given, this year's Derby and
Preakness with War Emblem--before the streak ended.</TE>
<TE>   "My record's safe," trainer Wayne Lukas said Sunday. Lukas won six
consecutive Triple Crown races with four horses.</TE>
<TE>   Lukas finished fifth Saturday with Proud Citizen, who suffered a
cracked shin in the race and will be shelved for three or four
months. Both he and McPeek, typical of most trainers, are already
lining up their candidates for next year. McPeek won a maiden race
Saturday at Churchill Downs with Risky Cat, who ran five furlongs in
a blazing :57 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got some breeding," McPeek said. "By Storm Cat out of an
Affirmed mare."</TE>
<TE>   Lukas thought that besides the Sarava connections, the other big
winner Saturday was Belmont Park's management. The on-track handle of
$12 million broke the record by about $1.5 million. Overall $90
million was bet on the 12-race card, breaking that record by about
$22 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem's unsuccessful Triple Crown attempt in Saturday's
Belmont Stakes generated the highest overnight rating for any horse
race since 1992--a 9.2 with a 21 share.</TE>
<TE>   The previous high was a 9.5/26 overnight for the 1992 Kentucky
Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Charismatic's Triple Crown attempt in the 1999 Belmont drew a
6.6/17.</TE>
<TE>   West Palm Beach, Fla., had the highest rating for Saturday's
Belmont, a 17.5. Los Angeles earned a 9.8/22.</TE>

<LD>Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times says Shaquille O'Neal's talents
are often taken for granted:</LD>
<LD>   "The Superman tattoo on his arm can't help him. He is doomed to a
life of grudging appreciation. It doesn't matter how many points he
scores, titles he wins, warm-and-cuddly TV ads he makes or goofy
jokes he cracks.</LD>
<LD>   "O'Neal, rather unfairly, always will be the bully who should
dominate basketball games.</LD>
<TE>   "He can't win this time, either. When Shaq excels, we expect it;
when he doesn't, he gets ripped.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost enough to make you feel sorry for him."</TE>
<TE>   Higher education: Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News points
out that O'Neal is giving lessons, sometimes painful ones, to
Stanford graduates Jason Collins and Mark Madsen:</TE>
<TE>   "[Collins and Madsen] already had much in common. Now they can
compare similar O'Neal-sized welts all over their arms, shoulders,
hearts and minds.</TE>
<TE>   "Madsen, finishing his second season as O'Neal's teammate, gets
pounded and hurtled through the air every day in practice. Collins,
even as a rookie, is New Jersey's best post defender, so he [gets to
guard] O'Neal in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   "Collins and Madsen aren't teammates anymore, but this is the kind
of thing that should bring alumni together."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only player to win basketball titles at
the Los Angeles City Section, NCAA and NBA levels?</TE>
<TE>   Commercial property: Randy Galloway of the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram, bemoaning the advertising glut at the Texas Rangers'
home field:</TE>
<TE>   "Our once beautiful yard has been transformed over the last few
seasons into 'The Billboard in Arlington,' meaning a constant
NASCAR-type advertising blur, where every available space except
Pudge Rodriguez's butt has been sold, and Preparation H is reportedly
making a bid on that.</TE>
<TE>   "What was once a cathedral for baseball now has the look of a
seedy truck stop."</TE>
<TE>   Going too far: Jason Kidd, predicting a turnaround for the New
Jersey Nets before this season: "We're going to turn this team around
360 degrees."</TE>
<TE>   Vote of confidence: Glenn Dickey of the San Francisco Chronicle
says Terry Donahue is making the right moves as general manager of
the 49ers:</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't easy following a legend, but Donahue has been growing
into his job, and the transition from Bill Walsh has been seamless.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't surprise anybody who knows Donahue, who thrived in a
very tough market in 20 years as head coach at UCLA, earning a spot
in the College Football Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   "He has applied the same intelligence that led to his coaching
success to his work as an executive."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Gail Goodrich, with Sun Valley Poly High, UCLA and
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tom Watson always brought three big weapons to golf
tournaments--a powerful driver, a deft putting stroke and an
imagination--says Dave Hackenberg of the Toledo Blade.</TE>
<TE>   Now you can add a fourth weapon, Watson told the columnist. A
bottle of Advil.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me, at 52 the wheels are definitely getting rusty," Watson
said before playing in the Senior PGA Championship this weekend. "You
have to keep 'em oiled. The Advil makes it easier to play golf."</TE>

<LD>   What: "This Gracious Season"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Josh Suchon</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Winter Publications</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.99</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds plans to release his autobiography later this year. In
the meantime, here's a book that provides an inside look at Bonds'
record-setting season last year, when he hit 73 home runs. The author
is the San Francisco Giant beat writer for the Oakland Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   In the acknowledgments Suchon writes, "This book is unauthorized,
but I believe this is a book Barry would want on his bookshelf at
home."</TE>
<TE>   Although this 390-page book is certainly not all puff--"I simply
wrote what I witnessed and lived for one year," writes
Suchon--Southern Californians who don't like Bonds may view it as
slanted toward the positive.</TE>
<TE>   The book opens with Bonds tying Mark McGwire's record of 70 home
runs, then reverts to spring training in 2001, where there is much
discussion of pending contract negotiations, because Bonds is in the
last year of his deal. His record-setting 71st home run against the
Dodgers is discussed toward the end of the book.</TE>
<TE>   The epilogue provides details of the five-year, $90-million
contract Bonds signed in January.</TE>

<LD>Managers of a World Cup stadium in Suwon have criticized FIFA

friendly match there despite possible damage to the grass, a local
report said.</LD>
<LD>   Fifteen FIFA officials and 20 Korean officials played the match at
the stadium in Suwon, despite appeals by stadium managers, Yonhap
news agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Stadium managers told the officials that it takes four days for
the grass to recover before another match, Yonhap quoted an
unidentified stadium employee as saying. Matches are scheduled
Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't understand their holding this match two days ahead of a
World Cup match," the unnamed stadium official said. "I think it

<LD>The Danish linesman who disallowed two Italian goals during the Group
G game against Croatia that led to a disputed 2-1 defeat for Italy,
reportedly is "very saddened" for having disallowed the goals.</LD>
<LD>   Jens Larsen admitted that striker Christian Vieri was not offsides
when he headed the ball into the Croatian goal, according to the
World Cup correspondent with Denmark's public radio DR. Larsen also
has said that he was wrong when he later signaled a foul by an
Italian forward seconds before Italy scored again, the radio
reported. That goal too was disallowed.</LD>
<LD>   "Both players and referees make mistakes, all human beings make
mistakes," an unidentified FIFA spokesman was quoted as saying by the
DR radio that didn't name the world soccer body official.</LD>

<HD>Great S-cape for Gagne, Dodgers</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Closer works out of jam in ninth to nail down
21st save and 2-1 win at Baltimore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>There are saves, there are "tough" saves, and there are saves that
defy all logic. Some statistical organization may have to find a new
label to classify Eric Gagne's escape act Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   With a runner on third base and no outs in the bottom of the ninth
inning, the Dodger closer struck out Melvin Mora and Brian Roberts
and got Chris Singleton to fly out to left field to preserve a 2-1
interleague victory over the Baltimore Orioles before 38,569 in
Camden Yards.</LD>
<LD>   Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez spun eight masterful innings,
giving up one run and four hits and striking out 10. Right fielder
Brian Jordan knocked in runs with a first-inning double and a
third-inning sacrifice fly, and the Dodger infield turned three
double plays, helping the team stay two games behind Arizona in the
National League West.</LD>
<TE>   But the real drama didn't begin until the ninth, when Oriole
pinch-hitter Gary Matthews led off with a double, ending Gagne's
string of 13 consecutive batters retired dating to May 29, and took
third on a botched pickoff play.</TE>
<TE>   A grounder through a drawn-in infield or a fly ball to the
outfield--or perhaps a suicide squeeze--would tie the score, and as
Matthews stood at third, "I thought we had it," he said. "I thought
it was a no-brainer."</TE>
<TE>   Then Gagne, the right-hander who has a major league-leading 21
saves in 22 opportunities, who has a 1.39 earned-run average and has
been almost untouchable all season, dialed his game up to a level few
figured existed.</TE>
<TE>   First, he struck out Mora on an 88-mph changeup. After falling
behind Roberts, 3 and 0, Gagne came back with three strikes, using a
changeup for strike two and whiffing Roberts with a 98-mph fastball.
The Dodgers exhaled, infielders retreated to normal depth, and Gagne
retired Singleton on a lazy fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Having Gagne out there ... you feel a little uneasy in that
situation, but you're not worried, and there's only a few teams in
baseball who can feel like that," Dodger right fielder Shawn Green
said. "He's the biggest reason we're where we are right now.</TE>
<TE>   "He's shortened the game, and he makes everyone's job easier, the
bullpen and the rotation. As a lineup, you know if you get a lead
late in the game, most times it's over. That's something the Yankees
have had over the last seven years, something the Giants and Padres
have had, but not many teams can say that."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne came of age as a closer April 11, when the
starter-turned-reliever struck out Jeff Kent and retired Reggie
Sanders on a fly ball with runners on first and third and one out to
preserve a 4-3 victory over San Francisco. But Sunday's save may have
put him in another class.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone had any questions about Gagne, you can dismiss them
now, because it just doesn't get any better than that," Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said. "I don't know what else you can ask him to do
to be considered one of the dominant closers in the league."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan went one step further.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played with Dennis Eckersley, with Lee Smith, some of the
best closers in the game," he said. "I tell you what. If he stays
healthy, he'll rank right up there when his career is over."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne's career as a closer didn't begin until this spring, when
the Dodgers, unable to trade for an established closer, gave him the
job, almost by default.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy talked about employing a closer-by-committee system, but it
was clearly evident that Gagne had the best stuff of any reliever,
and the only question was whether he had the mental makeup to handle
the role.</TE>
<TE>   But Gagne has bounced back from his only blown save of the season,
at Atlanta on May 7, by converting 11 consecutive save opportunities,
and any doubts about whether he'd wilt under pressure have been
erased. Closing seems to suit Gagne's mentality, as evidenced by his
reaction to Sunday's predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun," Gagne said. "I was pumped because Odalis pitched a
great game, and I didn't want to mess it up. I didn't back down. I
stayed positive, stayed aggressive and tried to work myself up."</TE>
<TE>   Gagne so baffled the Orioles that Manager Mike Hargrove and
several players marveled at his "nasty split-fingered pitch." Gagne
doesn't throw a splitter; that was a changeup. There is no question
about his fastball, though. It reaches 98 mph, and few have been able
to catch up to it.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope the hitters are [intimidated]," Gagne said. "I want to
make them feel uncomfortable. That makes it easier for you."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Perez Regains the Upper Hand on Hitters</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>It seemed the hitters had caught up to Odalis Perez in his previous
three starts, when the Dodger left-hander who was so effective in his
first nine games began to look more ordinary than extraordinary.</LD>
<LD>   But Perez, who in those three games gave up nine earned runs and
25 hits in 17 innings, got his groove back Sunday, shutting down the
Baltimore Orioles during an eight-inning, 98-pitch gem in which he
allowed one run and four hits, struck out 10 and walked one to
improve to 6-3.</LD>
<LD>   Perez, who came within one bad-hop single of throwing a perfect
game against the Chicago Cubs on April 26, faced 26 batters, two over
the minimum, and was backed by superb defense up the middle, as
shortstop Alex Cora and second baseman Mark Grudzielanek turned three
double plays.</LD>
<TE>   The Orioles scored their only run in the third, when Marty Cordova
doubled and Brook Fordyce singled to left. Perez faced only three
batters in seven of eight innings and capped his performance by
striking out Tony Batista, Cordova and Fordyce in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a much more effective changeup and did a real good job of
setting it up by pitching inside effectively," Manager Jim Tracy
said. "He threw some phenomenal changeups today."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Eric Karros has five home runs in the Dodgers' first
62 games, a 13-homer pace that is far off the 30-homer seasons he put
up five times between 1995 and 2000, but production hasn't been a
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Karros is batting .308 and ranks second on the team with 32 runs
batted in despite his transition from slugger to contact hitter.
Karros has cut down on his swing and is hitting more balls to the
opposite field, an approach that has resulted in only 26 strikeouts,
a 70-strikeout pace that would be a career low.</TE>
<TE>   He's batting .339 with runners in scoring position and .297 with
two strikes. He's also hitting .500 (nine for 18) with three doubles,
a homer and six RBIs when the game is close and late--within two runs
in the seventh inning or later.</TE>
<TE>   "His at-bats in critical situations have been exceptional," Tracy
said. "That line drive with the bases loaded is just as pretty as the
ball hit halfway up the seats."</TE>
<TE>   Karros has recovered from chronic back problems that hampered him
in 2001, when he hit a career-low .235 with 15 homers and 63 RBIs.
But does he still have the power to hit 30 home runs in a season?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if he does or not, but I don't know if it's
necessary," Tracy said. "If he hits less than 30 homers but there's a
lot of quality at-bats in between, I'll take that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The fluid-filled bumps on the back of Grudzielanek's right hand,
which had to be drained in May, have returned, and the second baseman
may need them drained again this week. The condition, probably caused
by a minor tendon tear, bothers the second baseman when he's
hitting.... Eric Gagne, who recorded his 21st save Sunday, has 44
strikeouts in 32 1/3 innings.</TE>

<TE>   Update--After a three-game series in one of baseball's most
picturesque settings, Baltimore's Camden Yards, the Dodgers will
experience the opposite end of the stadium spectrum--the dreary,
catwalk-filled, artificial turf-covered dome that the Devil Rays call
home. Tampa Bay is the worst team in baseball, an offensively
impaired club with an American League-low .236 average, and anything
less than a sweep for the Dodgers should be considered a
disappointment.</TE>

<HD>Channel Surfers Finally Catch the Perfect Wave</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five-hundred and fifty cable channels and not a thing to watch over a
sports weekend except:</LD>
<LD>   Two NBA Finals games, the Stanley Cup finals, the Williams sisters
on red clay at the French Open, War Emblem chasing (and we mean
chasing) the Triple Crown at the Belmont Stakes, Mike Tyson versus
Lennox Lewis, the Senior PGA golf championship, around-the-clock
World Cup action on ESPN, the Dodgers at Baltimore for the first time
since getting swept in the 1966 World Series (Dave McNally beat Don
Drysdale in Game 4), upper-body Barry Bonds blasting an upper-deck
home run at Yankee Stadium, Curt Schilling over Pedro Martinez, Pete
Weber bowling in sunglasses and a fascinating public television
documentary on hand fishing in Oklahoma--Look ma, no hooks!</LD>
<LD>   We muddle on.</LD>
<TE>   News item: Lewis knocks out Tyson to retain heavyweight boxing
title.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Yep, we fell for it again--crook, line and
stinker. We got conned by an ex-con so down on his luck and desperate
for cash he manipulated masses into thinking he was still so crazy
after all these years you had to shell out the money just in case he
took Michael Buffer hostage at center ring.</TE>
<TE>   The Memphis Mauler turned out to be Lewis, of course, not Mild
Mike. If you read the smart boxing writers, this was the way it was
always going to turn out, yet promotions have a way of always and
incurably sucking you back into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, after Lewis sliced and diced him, Tyson cowered like a
puppy recently whacked across the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.
The man who once threatened to eat Lewis' children (if he had any)
was afterward seen pathetically wiping sweat off his opponent's brow
and begging for a rematch. At that moment you could almost picture
Tyson ringing a bell for the Salvation Army on Christmas morning.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson admitted he wasn't prepared for the fight, was only in it
for the payday and acted like a jerk (this time) only for the
purposes for promotion.</TE>
<TE>   No fair telling us ahead of time, huh?</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, we contributed to this farce at $54.95 a pop, a chunk
of which goes to Tyson as if tossed into the vagrant's cup.</TE>
<TE>   You know those advertisements boxers are now taking out on their
backs?</TE>
<TE>   Mine is up for rent for IMACHUMP.com.</TE>
<TE>   News item: War Emblem loses Belmont Stakes and bid for Triple
Crown.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: If you believe (Kobe Bryant does) that horses are
athletes, and we get on athletes for not running out ground balls,
was it OK for me to boo War Emblem for loafing it down the stretch?</TE>
<TE>   You got the feeling after he stumbled out of the gate that War
Emblem, a tempestuous type who prefers to run from ahead, got tired
of getting mud kicked in his eyes and allowed his mind to drift
toward that giant chocolate hay sundae that awaited him back at the
paddock.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Serena Williams defeats older sister Venus to win
French Open.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: A truly incredible scene when you allow yourself
the inconceivable thought of John McEnroe, after his wrenching 1984
finals defeat, pulling out his pocket camera and taking pictures of
Ivan Lendl on the podium.</TE>
<TE>   McEnroe: Ivan, I think I got a good shot of you hoisting the
trophy you took from me in five sets although some jerk in the
background made a peace sign over your head with his fingers.</TE>
<TE>   News item: The U.S. upsets Portugal in World Cup group play.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: A huge win for U.S. soccer, although ESPN
announcer Jack Edwards' final-seconds call, "Mine eyes have seen the
glory!" was about as over-the-top as Niagara Falls. He might have
opted for something a tad less scripted: "We the people of the United
States, in order to form a more perfect union, have port-holed
Portugal!" or, perhaps, "Glory be, the funk's on me!"</TE>
<TE>   Also, this just in off the futbol wires: France and Jerry Lewis
now have another thing in common--neither has scored a goal yet in
World Cup action.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tom Tolbert, Bill Walton and Charles Barkley share the
same NBC stage during NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The boys in research are checking to see if any of
these "Windtalkers" is of Navajo decent.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Jose Canseco admits to book publishers that he took
steroids.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: We've duly filed this in our "shocking
revelations" cabinet next to "Pat Boone drinks milk."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Minute Maid takes over naming rights for the former
Enron Field in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This makes up for all the juice baseball lost when
Canseco hung up his syringe.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Consumer advocate Ralph Nader asks the NBA to review
Game 6 of Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Sources say Nader's manifesto to the NBA office
was titled "Lakers: Unsafe at Any Lead."</TE>
<TE>   So, Nader thinks the officiating in Game 6 smelled of pickled
herring on August asphalt? We suspect the former Green Party
presidential candidate is a closet Celtic fan, otherwise Nader would
have taken an equal interest in the Kobe cheeseburger conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   Nader's next crusade against Lakers: why aren't bench players
wearing seat belts?</TE>
<TE>   News item: Walton keeps saying on the air, "Down it big man, down
it."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I keep saying, "Stop saying that, big man, stop
saying that."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Boston Red Sox consider putting 500 seats atop Fenway
Park's "Green Monster."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The nosebleed seats are being creatively marketed
as "fall-out-of-the-sky boxes."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Shaquille O'Neal says, "I can't go a day without
someone saying something negative about me."</TE>
<TE>   Second (negative) thought: I'd like to see Shaq shed about 40
pounds and lay off that fall-away bank shot.</TE>
<TE>   News item: PBS airs documentary on hand fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: They call it "Noodling" and it works like this:
guys without lives from Oklahoma, dressed in jeans and tennis shoes,
wade in muddy-watered bogs and snag 40-pound catfish with their bare
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Noodles for brains, I say.</TE>

<HD>Costa Goes Route on 66th</HD>
<DH>French Open: After 65 tournaments without a title, Spanish
veteran doesn't let countryman get in his way in final.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The temptation is to say that Albert Costa is simply Thomas Johansson
with a better story.</LD>
<LD>   Within moments of Johansson's surprise title a few months ago at
the Australian Open, commentators said the Swede had better enjoy it,
because it would probably be his last Grand Slam title. A journeyman
finally had his moment.</LD>
<LD>   Sunday, those words were not said about Spain's Costa, the
20th-seeded player who turned in a masterful clay-court performance
in his first Grand Slam final, defeating his countryman, 11th-seeded
Juan Carlos Ferrero, 6-1, 6-0, 4-6, 6-3, in 2 hours 30 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   He took advantage of a 25-minute rain delay and returned from the
break to win 11 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Costa, 26, has played like this before, only to have his nerves
take over at crucial moments. But the birth of his twin daughters
last year calmed him, and work with a sports psychologist prevented
him from dwelling on the fact he had gone 65 tournaments without a
title, since August 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-six was the magic number for the humble Spaniard.</TE>
<TE>   When Ferrero double-faulted on match point--his second serve
sailed long--Costa dropped onto his back and nearly completed a
backward somersault. Ferrero went over to Costa's side and hugged
him.</TE>
<TE>   It was not like Johansson, who barely cracked a smile when he beat
Marat Safin in the Australian final in January. Sunday was an
emotion-filled day for Costa. Before receiving the winner's trophy
from former champion Guillermo Vilas of Argentina, Costa went into
the stands, wisely using the stairs underneath the stadium, and
hugged and kissed his entourage, holding up his infants, Claudia and
Alma.</TE>
<TE>   Costa is getting married Friday to the mother of his girls,
Cristina, who beamed with pride Sunday as some other supporters cried
for joy. "I couldn't tell them anything, I just raised them in the
air so that everybody could see them," Costa said of his babies.</TE>
<TE>   It is the fifth time a Spaniard has won a Grand Slam tournament in
the Open era, preceded by titles by Andres Gimeno (1972 French Open),
Manuel Orantes (1975 U.S. Open), Sergi Bruguera (1993 and 1994 French
Open) and Carlos Moya (1998 French Open).</TE>
<TE>   For years, Costa has been the best friend in waiting, watching the
other Spaniards take the lead, win titles and garner headlines.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 1994 final, Costa said: "I was watching Alberto Berasategui
that day and Bruguera; I was so young. I was 18 years old. I was
practicing with Alberto, and I said, 'OK, if he's in the final, why
cannot I be in the final?' I play good. I play almost like him."</TE>
<TE>   Those thoughts went through his mind again when Moya beat Alex
Corretja (who will be Costa's best man).</TE>
<TE>   "Why not for me?" Costa asked.</TE>
<TE>   He kept putting pressure on himself, and his ranking dropped from
No. 26 at the end of 2000 to 40th at the end of last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I was getting completely crazy in the court," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His attitude changed when his daughters were born.</TE>
<TE>   "You start to think of other things," he said. "Before tennis was
100% of my life, and now it is not. Now I have my two little babies
that I love a lot. Sometimes when I lose a match, I think, 'OK, I'm
going home. I'm going to see my little babies, and I don't get that
drama, no?' "</TE>
<TE>   Many assumed Costa would succumb to his nerves because it was his
first Slam final. This was supposed to be time for the kid,
22-year-old Ferrero, to step forward.</TE>
<TE>   But the other Slam final newcomer, Ferrero, was the shaky one,
losing the first two sets in 46 minutes. Commentators began talking
about this being one of the worst Slam finals.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ferrero pulled himself together and turned it into a match.
He won the third set and had opportunities to make the fourth
interesting when he broke Costa to pull to 3-3. But Costa broke
Ferrero's serve at love in the next game, and Costa won the next two
to close out the final.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, Ferrero mentioned his right ankle as a reason for
not performing to his capability. He sprained it in practice before
the second round, needing injections to continue although he hardly
appeared bothered against Andre Agassi or Safin.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel some pain in my legs, abductor and also my abdominal
[muscles]," Ferrero said. "... I think this is all coming from my
ankle because my ankle was not very good during the two weeks. I
think this was the reason of all my pains."</TE>
<TE>   Costa's drop shots--seven for winners--and tactical play may have
been a reason for the world of pain. For Costa, it was the best match
of his life. Humorously, he refused to trot out cliches.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to believe, but I feel very proud of myself," he said.
"And I'm very happy. I don't like to say 'dream come true' because
everyone says the same thing. But sometimes you think, 'Oh, am I
going to win or not? What's going to happen?' And now I did it. I'm
convinced that I won in Roland Garros."</TE>

<HD>Clemens Gets Walkover on Bonds</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Roger Clemens didn't give Barry Bonds anything to swing at Sunday.
Instead, the Yankee ace hit him--just as he hinted--and left San
Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker questioning the pitcher's
courage.</LD>
<LD>   "I've got a lot of respect for Roger as a pitcher," Baker said.
"What do they call him, the Rocket? Maybe Roger the Dodger, that's
good enough."</LD>
<LD>   Clemens plunked Bonds with a pitch on his protective arm guard and
walked him three times as the Yankees pitched around the slugger and
defeated the Giants, 4-2.</LD>
<TE>   The matchup of future Hall of Famers--perhaps the best hitter of
this generation facing perhaps its most dominant pitcher for the
first time in the regular season--was a letdown for fans. Clemens got
his 288th career victory; Bonds took only two swings.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens (8-2) came inside with a third-inning fastball that hit
Bonds' large plastic arm guard just above the elbow. Bonds stood at
the plate for a bit with a smirk before heading to first base.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens had said he might throw inside to Bonds and wanted to
"even things out" by getting him to take his armor off.</TE>
<TE>   "He's right up on top of the plate," Clemens said. "That elbow
guard is almost sticking in the zone, so it's tough."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds did not talk to reporters after the game, but Baker had a
comment on Clemens' actions.</TE>
<TE>   "You can be bold over here in the American League and get away
with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens is scheduled to make his next start Saturday against the
New York Mets at Shea Stadium. It would mark the first time Clemens
has to bat against the Mets since beaning Mike Piazza and later
throwing the barrel of a broken bat in his path during the 2000 World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds drew four walks, tying a major league record with three
intentional walks in a nine-inning game. He reached base in 11 of 14
plate appearances in the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not here to entertain people, I'm here to try to win
ballgames," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "I said we'll pitch to
him, but if there's a base open and the game is in the balance, I'm
walking him."</TE>
<TE>   Nick Johnson's two-out, two-run double against closer Robb Nen in
the eighth inning gave the Yankees a 3-2 lead, and Rondell White
followed with a run-scoring single. New York took two of three in the
interleague series.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds came to the plate with a runner on first and two out in the
ninth, bringing the Yankee Stadium crowd of 55,335 to its feet. But
after reliever Steve Karsay fell behind on the count 3-and-1, he
walked Bonds intentionally to put the tying run on base.</TE>
<TE>   "When it got to 3-1, I ran out of guts," Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   Benito Santiago then hit a short-hop shot to third baseman Enrique
Wilson, who made a nice play and got a forceout for the third out.</TE>
<TE>   One day after hitting a home run 20 rows deep into the right-field
upper deck, Bonds didn't get much to hit.</TE>
<TE>   The first two times he was intentionally walked, he tossed the
guard away after two pitches.</TE>
<TE>   When Russ Ortiz threw high to Jason Giambi in the bottom of the
third, plate umpire Joe West warned both dugouts, bringing an
argument from Baker.</TE>
<TE>   The sellout crowd was buzzing when Bonds stepped to the plate to
face Clemens in the first inning. But the fans booed when he walked
him on five pitches, and by the seventh inning, when Bonds came up
with two out and an open base, they were booing before he even got
near the plate, knowing he would be walked intentionally.</TE>

<HD>Zoeller Gets First Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AKRON, Ohio</DL>
<LD>The drought is over for Fuzzy Zoeller--and maybe it is for the Senior
PGA Tour, as well.</LD>
<LD>   Zoeller made several daring escapes for par coming down the
stretch to win the Senior PGA Championship on Sunday, his first
victory since joining the senior tour this year.</LD>
<LD>   Zoeller closed with a two-under-par 68 to finish at two-under 278,
two strokes better than third-round leader Bobby Wadkins and
three-time Senior PGA Championship winner Hale Irwin.</LD>
<TE>   The major championship victory might have given the senior circuit
a major shot of adrenaline. Zoeller is seen as a savior for the
Senior PGA Tour, which is desperate for a player with personality to
counteract declining TV ratings and sagging attendance.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just one person. We're doing a lot of positives for the game
of golf on the senior tour," he said. "We don't want people to think
we're clones. We want to show them we're human. I know I am."</TE>
<TE>   Zoeller collected $360,000--his largest check in 27 years as a
pro.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was Zoeller's first in any tournament since winning
the Anheuser-Busch Classic 16 years ago on the PGA Tour. The 1979
Masters and 1984 U.S. Open were among his 10 tour victories, but he
never won a PGA title, finishing second to Larry Nelson in the 1981
PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure I'd ever win again," he said. "Every time I got
close, somebody seemed to play a little better."</TE>

<HD>Tucson Driver Dies at Irwindale</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Baker killed in Featherlite race when car
appears to be brushed and slides into wall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Baker, a redheaded journeyman stock car driver from Tucson who
was killed Saturday night at Irwindale Speedway in a NASCAR
Featherlite Southwest Series race, was a veteran of six years with
the West Coast series.</LD>
<LD>   Baker, 49, apparently lost control of his Chevrolet Monte Carlo on
Lap 36 of the 150-lap K&amp;N Filter-sponsored race while battling for
10th place with Greg Voigt of Santa Barbara, who had the inside line
coming off the Turn 2. The cars appeared to brush, Baker's car
sliding up the track into the outside wall almost headfirst.</LD>
<LD>   Former series champion Sean Woodside of Saugus, running behind
Baker, was one of a number of drivers who took evasive action to try
to miss the sliding car, but as Baker came down off the wall his car
clipped Woodside's Chevrolet.</LD>
<TE>   Voigt, whose car was not damaged, went on to finish fourth.
Woodside, who lost several laps while his damaged car was being
repaired, wound up 26th.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was transported by ambulance to Kaiser Permanente Medical
Center in Baldwin Park where he was pronounced dead on arrival,
according to Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedic John
Denton. Baker's wife, Robin, was with him.</TE>
<TE>   The fatality was not announced to the near-sellout crowd of 6,160.</TE>
<TE>   Baker had started first, having won the pole with a speed of
100.660 mph around the half-mile paved oval. He also won the pole at
Irwindale last year with a 101.632-mph lap.</TE>
<TE>   "John loved racing and was a fun guy to be around," said Craig
Raudman, last year's series champion from Bakersfield and one of
Baker's closest racing buddies. "He was the hardest working guy I
ever knew, I always respected him because he made all his own money
hauling heavy equipment, he never had anything handed to him. And he
loved to spend it on his race car.</TE>
<TE>   "Tracy Norman, his crew chief, ran my team last year when we won
the championship and also supervised Baker's out of the same shop in
Bakersfield. This year, when my team dropped out of the series,
Norman went to work for John.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to hang out a lot together when we went on three-day
racing trips, and he was always joking around, a guy who could make
you laugh. It's a terrible loss."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Hunter, NASCAR vice president of communications, said that
Baker was wearing a Hutchens head-and-shoulder device and an
open-face helmet. Head-and-shoulder restraint equipment was made
mandatory for NASCAR touring series this year.</TE>
<TE>   Baker drove the No. 18 Chevrolet for Mid-States Truck and Rigging
Inc., the company he owned. After five races this year, he was 13th
in Featherlite points with a best finish of eighth last month at
Stockton Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   In six years, Baker competed in 31 Southwest Series races with a
best finish of fourth last year at the Bullring at Las Vegas. His
career earnings were $32,215. He also had competed occasionally in
Winston West races. Before joining the Southwest Series, he drove
late-model stock cars at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   According to NASCAR officials, it was the first fatality since the
series was formed in 1986. This year there are 14 races in
California, Arizona and Colorado. Irwindale was No. 6. Irwindale and
Featherlite series officials refused to answer questions about
Baker's career or the accident, referring all inquiries to NASCAR
corporate officials in Daytona Beach, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Featherlite series cars are slightly smaller versions of those
driven in Winston Cup, 1998-2002 versions of U.S.-made, steel-bodied
passenger-car production sedans. The cars weigh a minimum of 2,900
pounds, compared with 3,400 pounds for a Cup car, with a wheelbase of
between 101 and 105 inches, powered by 350-358 cubic-inch V8 engines.</TE>
<TE>   The race was won by David Gilliland of Riverside, who took the
lead after Raudman, driving in his first series race this year, had
his right front tire go flat on Lap 138.</TE>
<TE>   In support races, Rip Michels held off Ben Walker to win the
NASCAR super late-model, and Michael May won his fifth American Race
Truck event.</TE>

<HD>Japan's Success Raises Bar</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Inamoto's goal gives his team a 1-0 victory over
Russia and his country its first victory in World Cup to the delight
of fans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after scoring the goal that gave co-host Japan its first-ever
World Cup victory Sunday, Junichi Inamoto offered his team and
country a rather reasonable piece of advice.</LD>
<LD>   "The important thing," Inamoto said, "is not to get carried away."</LD>
<LD>   Sorry, Junichi. Way too late.</LD>
<TE>   Inamoto, a 22-year-old midfielder who plays professionally for the
English club Arsenal, set off wild celebrations across the land of
the rising decibel level with his 51st-minute goal, securing Japan's
1-0 triumph over Russia at Yokohama International Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night television news programs in Japan overflowed with
footage of delirious fans screaming "Nip-pon! Nip-pon!" in the
streets, hugging and dancing on pub tables, even jumping off small
bridges into water.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a huge moment for football in Japan that we are living
right now," Japan Coach Philippe Troussier said. "This is important
for Japanese football and the nation."</TE>
<TE>   It is particularly important in that it keeps Japan undefeated in
a tournament it is co-hosting with South Korea, which won its opener
while Japan tied its first game--and had been lording it over the
Japanese in the days since.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Japan has broken into the World Cup victory column, and at
1-0-1 in Group H, it can clinch passage to the second round with a
victory over Tunisia on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In a fast-paced match, the deciding goal was created when Atsushi
Yanagasiwa handled a long left-sided cross from Koji Nakata and
played it to an onrushing Inamoto, who slithered his way into the
Russian penalty area and lofted a precise shot over the reach of
goalkeeper Ruslan Nigmatullin.</TE>
<TE>   Russia nearly equalized six minutes later when substitute Vladimir
Beschastnykh drew Japan goalkeeper Seigo Narazaki off his line,
carried the ball around him but somehow missed the open
goal--knocking his shot against the side netting.</TE>
<TE>   Russia had another scoring opportunity denied when Igor Semshov
was taken down in the box by Kazuyki Toda, but no foul was called.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it was a penalty," Russian midfielder Alexander
Mostovoi said. "If it had been given as a penalty, who knows what
would have happened?"</TE>
<TE>   Troussier, however, maintained that Japan's victory "was fully
merited.... We had a lot of pressure on our shoulders and tonight, we
saw a brilliant Japanese side play."</TE>
<TE>   Russia (1-1-0) probably will need a victory over Belgium in its
final group game to advance to the next round.</TE>

<HD>Da Matta Too Slick for Field</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Despite qualifying controversy, he dominates
race and wins Grand Prix of Monterey.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTEREY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>All the whining by Chip Ganassi wouldn't have mattered. If Cristiano
da Matta had been thrown out of the Championship Auto Racing Teams
series, as Ganassi had suggested after Da Matta oiled the track
during qualifying, the diminutive Brazilian still would have found a
way to win.</LD>
<LD>   That's how good Da Matta was Sunday on the 2.238-mile layout at
Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.</LD>
<LD>   Driving a dominant car and leading 82 of 87 laps, Da Matta
annihilated the field in the 20th Bridgestone Grand Prix of Monterey
featuring the Shell 300, finishing more than 19 seconds ahead of
second-place Christian Fittipaldi, his teammate for team owners Carl
Haas and Paul Newman.</LD>
<TE>   It was Da Matta's sixth career victory and fourth in the last
seven races dating to last season. It came the first time Da Matta
started from the pole position, one that drew controversy. Da Matta
blew his Toyota engine late in the Saturday qualifying session and
failed to get off the racing line, fearing that he might bring out a
red flag stoppage and lose his best lap time if he parked the car.
Ganassi claimed the oil on the track prevented his driver, Kenny
Brack, from winning the pole.</TE>
<TE>   CART fined Da Matta $10,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct, and will
enact rule changes that allow a driver to get off course without
causing a red flag. If Da Matta had lost his best time from that
session, a condition for bringing out a red flag, he says he still
would have started fourth.</TE>
<TE>   But even on a day when passing was difficult, it probably would
not have mattered. Da Matta finished 19.087 seconds ahead of
Fittipaldi, who started fifth in the 19-car field. Brack finished
third.</TE>
<TE>   The only time Da Matta trailed came after pitting upon
encountering lapped traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been very tough to get it away from me," Da Matta
said of his victory.</TE>
<TE>   Even Brack admitted Da Matta was dialed in.</TE>
<TE>   "On speed, he was faster, but to pass on this track is pretty
difficult," Brack said.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't have mattered, Da Matta countered: "I would have passed
him in the pits. We had the same situation in Mexico when I had the
best car but had problems in qualifying and started fifth."</TE>
<TE>   Coupled with a fourth-place finish by another Ganassi driver,
Bruno Junquiera, it gave Toyota the top four positions, and provided
the manufacturer's first sweep in the series. Toyota powered six of
the top seven finishers. Patrick Carpentier, in a Ford-powered
Reynard, broke up the sweep with a fifth-place finish. He did so by
making one of the few on-track passes, slipping underneath another
Ganassi driver, sixth-place Scott Dixon, on Lap 68.</TE>
<TE>   While the racing was reminiscent of a parade, Fittipaldi said it
was OK with him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what racing's all about, the quick cars win and the slow
cars don't win," he said. "With all due respect, [defending race
winner Max Papis] is a great driver, but last year he started dead
last and didn't pass one guy on the track and he won the race [with a
fuel economy strategy]."</TE>
<TE>   With his victory, Da Matta moved into the championship series lead
with 51 points.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the top four drivers going into the race scored a
point, previous leader Michel Jordain Jr., who finished ninth and is
in second place in the standings with 46 points. Fittipaldi moved to
third with 43 points, followed by Junquiera with 38 and Dario
Franchitti with 35.</TE>
<TE>   Franchitti failed to get through the second turn before his day
ended. He and Adrian Fernandez--making his 150th start--were
casualties in the Andretti Hairpin. Jordain was tapped by Fernandez
and slid crossways in traffic, and Bell, Mario Dominguez and Jimmy
Vasser were collected in the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tracy, who won last week at Milwaukee and finished second a
week earlier at the Indianapolis 500, brought out the second--and
last--yellow flag on Lap 17 when he lost his right rear wheel after
exiting the pits.</TE>
<TE>   Papis, tied for third place with Tracy going into to race,
finished a lap down, in 13th place, the first of the non-scoring
positions, and is tied for sixth overall in the series.</TE>

<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>The LPGA Championship was one for the ages, all right.</LD>
<LD>   Only not for 45-year-old Beth Daniel.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel's bid to become the oldest major champion in LPGA history
buckled under relentless pressure from Se Ri Pak, who turned a
four-shot deficit into a three-shot victory Sunday and set a record
she knew nothing about.</LD>
<TE>   The 24-year-old South Korean became the youngest woman to claim
four majors, surpassing Mickey Wright, who was 25 when she won her
fourth of 13 majors at the 1960 LPGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't have any idea I made a new record," she said.
"Thank God I didn't know."</TE>
<TE>   Pak had enough on her mind during another difficult day at DuPont
Country Club--like staying in the short grass, hitting the greens and
avoiding big numbers.</TE>
<TE>   She handled it with ease, living up to her reputation of playing
her best under the toughest conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Pak closed with a one-under 70, the second time she has come from
four strokes behind in the final round to win a major.</TE>
<TE>   "She did everything she needed to do to win this tournament,"
Daniel said. "She hit fairways, she hit greens, she made putts--and I
did none of it."</TE>
<TE>   It was a tough loss for Daniel, a Hall of Famer with 32 victories,
but none since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She was poised to become the oldest woman to win a major,
surpassing Babe Zaharias, who was 42 years 11 months when she won the
1954 U.S. Women's Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the ghost of Babe Zaharias stepped on my ball," Daniel
said.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Shows That It Can Do</HD>
<DH>World Cup: Team shakes off early lapse on defense and
defeats Ecuador, 2-1, to take sole possession of first place in Group
G.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIYAGI, Japan</DL>
<LD>Mexico's slogan for this unlikely World Cup campaign, Si Se Puede,
has always been an iffy proposition at best--and an invitation for
disaster at worst.</LD>
<LD>   The rough English translation, "Yes We Can," was once the battle
cry for a certain Anaheim baseball team, and if Mexican soccer
federation officials are a little foggy on their Angel history, maybe
it's wise not to tell them that when the pressure's on, the Angels
can be counted on to kick the ball with the best of them.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe the Mexican team should just press forward in its blissful
ignorance, because what these players don't know hasn't hurt them
yet. What they do know--they own sole possession of first place in
Group G with one round-robin game left--ranks as one of the most
surprising developments in a very surprising World Cup.</LD>
<TE>   "We are lucky," Mexico backup goalkeeper Jorge Campos said after
his team rallied to defeat Ecuador, 2-1, before 45,610 at Miyagi
Stadium, and that's certainly putting a new twist on that borrowed
slogan.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Mexico has been lucky. Lucky that Croatia upset group
favorite Italy on Saturday. Lucky that Alex Aguinaga, Ecuador's
captain and playmaking midfielder, was limited to 33 minutes Sunday
because of a thigh injury. Lucky that 75 minutes of efficient soccer
continue to get the job done in a tournament where nothing less than
90 usually is required.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico fell behind Ecuador in the fifth minute, falling asleep in
the back while Agustin Delgado slipped behind Rafael Marquez for the
go-ahead header, and was in full-emergency alert during the last 10
minutes, wincing every time Ecuador substitute forward Carlos Tenorio
touched the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Tenorio, loaded with energy and the fastest man on the field,
terrorized the Mexican defense after his entry in the 52nd minute. He
almost scored twice in the last 10 minutes--denied first by an
outstanding save by Mexico goalkeeper Oscar Perez, then missing by
inches with a running blast from just outside the area.</TE>
<TE>   "As with the game against Croatia, we were very cold the last 10
minutes of the game," Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre said. "The first
five minutes, we were bad. The last 10, terrible. Today, we played
just 75 minutes. We need to correct that."</TE>
<TE>   And in a hurry. Mexico, at 2-0-0, may lead Group G with six
points, three ahead of Italy and Croatia, both 1-1-0. But Aguirre
knows that could be a temporary condition, dependent largely on how
Italy feels about matters. Mexico closes group play Thursday against
Italy in Oita--and Italy needs a victory to salvage a berth in the
second round, along with its reputation after the Italians' 2-1 loss
to Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico, meanwhile, has clinched nothing yet. A victory or tie
against Italy will send Mexico through. But a loss, coupled with a
Croatia triumph over Ecuador and the goal-differential tumblers
falling the right way, could send Mexico home by the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very hard," Aguirre said of the Italy match.
"They have a lot of good players there--Inzaghi, Del Piero, Totti,
Vieri ... "</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre could have continued, but he had made his point.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to play better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   How much better?</TE>
<TE>   "A perfect game."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico made things difficult for itself early when Ecuador's
Ulises de la Cruz freed himself down the right flank and crossed to
an unmarked Delgado, who headed high into the net off Perez's
outstretched hand.</TE>
<TE>   Five minutes in, Ecuador had its first World Cup goal, and Mexico
its first deficit of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   It lasted 23 minutes. Jared Borgetti equalized when he met Ramon
Morales' left-wing cross with a running volley, slicing the ball with
the inside of his left foot past Ecuador keeper Jose Cevallos and
against the inside netting.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the half was dominated by fouls, falls and some
bad Ecuadorean play-acting--the most glaring example being Raul
Guerron clamping both hands to his face and crying out in apparent
agony after being bumped in the chest by Mexico midfielder Joahan
Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico took the lead on a 57th-minute give-and-go between Borgetti
and central midfielder Gerardo Torrado, freeing Torrado for a
left-footed strike that beat Cevallos from just outside the penalty
area.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the match, with Tenorio running rampant, Mexico
retreated into pile-the-sandbags mode. For Mexico, the last 10
minutes were so unnerving, Aguirre brought on a fresh midfielder,
Gabriel Caballero, for the last four minutes and added an extra
defender, Sigifredo Mercado, for the last 60 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We did sweat a lot," Aguirre said. "It was a serious match, it
was what we had hoped for. But it did turn into an uphill struggle."</TE>
<TE>   From here, the climb for Mexico only gets steeper. Waiting for the
Mexicans in Oita will be an angry Italian team desperate for three
points.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope that Mexico plays its best match of the World Cup against
Italy," Aguirre said. "We have to be very clever, very patient, very
strong, very confident."</TE>
<TE>   And very lucky. But when it comes to Mexico and this World Cup,
that goes without saying.</TE>

<HD>Jarrett Wins Pocono 500, Ends Drought</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dale Jarrett was starting to wonder when his slump would end. He knew
luck played a part when that finally happened Sunday at Pocono
Raceway in Long Pong, Pa.</LD>
<LD>   Certain to be beaten by at least one driver who could have
stretched his gas to the end, and being outrun by Ricky Rudd, Jarrett
figured the Pocono 500 would be another loss even though he was
running well.</LD>
<LD>   "That last yellow, that's when you know that prayer works,"
Jarrett said. "When that caution came out, I knew we'd have a
chance."</LD>
<TE>   Jarrett ended a 30-race losing streak and won for the third time
in his career at Pocono.</TE>
<TE>   He passed Rudd, his Robert Yates Racing teammate, on the 195th of
200 laps, then won under caution after Rudd hit the wall with one lap
to go. Rudd had a late tire problem that made it easy for Jarrett. He
finished 17th</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the first for 1999 Winston Cup champion Jarrett
since July at Loudon, N.H. It was his 29th victory.</TE>

<TE>   Michael Schumacher insists victories and championships are no
longer his main goals.</TE>
<TE>   "I said in 2000 that from now on, I just race for the pleasure,
whether I win too many races or not, or championships," he said after
winning the Canadian Grand Prix at Montreal, his 59th victory, and
making a record-tying fifth Formula One championship a virtual
certainty with half a season left.</TE>
<TE>   He took the lead for good when pole-winner Juan Pablo Montoya made
his second and final pit stop on Lap 51 of the 70-lap event.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya moved back to second place when Schumacher's Ferrari
teammate, Rubens Barrichello, pitted. But his challenge ended on Lap
56 when smoke began pouring from the engine on his Williams BMW and
he pulled off the track.</TE>
<TE>   David Coulthard inherited second place in his McLaren Mercedes and
fought off Barrichello.</TE>

<HD>Larionov Still Amazing Them</HD>
<DH>Stanley Cup finals: Even at 41, Red Wing forward practices
what he always preaches with impressive patience on winning shot in
Game 3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RALEIGH, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Grueling. Demanding. Exhausting. Tiring.</LD>
<LD>   Those are some of the words that best describe Saturday night's
Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals. The veteran Detroit Red Wings
outlasted Carolina with a three-overtime, 3-2 victory over the
younger Hurricanes in the third-longest game in finals history.</LD>
<LD>   Less than 15 hours after the five-hour game ended, the main topic
of conversation was Detroit's ageless wonder Igor Larionov, who at 41
was the oldest player on the ice. Larionov scored the game-winner
with his second goal of the game.</LD>
<TE>   "He knows his game," Detroit winger Darren McCarty said. "He
always preaches patience, and I think last night's goal is a classic
example. I think most of us would have shot it, but not Igor. I think
most people thought he was going to pass ... but he was patient
enough to wait out the defensemen, and he waited until the goaltender
went down, and he ho-hummed it to the top of the net."</TE>
<TE>   Just that Larionov is still playing is a story itself. At 21,
Larionov began playing on the Central Red Army team and played eight
seasons for the elite Russian team.</TE>
<TE>   He was selected the Soviet player of the year once and picked to
the first-team all-stars four times. He won Olympic gold medals with
the Soviet Union in 1984 and 1988, and he won gold at the 1983 World
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Larionov did not make the jump to the NHL until 1991 but he
doesn't regret that it took so long.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to play in big [events] like [the] Canada Cup in '81;
that was my first official tournament '81," Larionov said. "We played
against Team Canada in the finals, when Scotty Bowman was the coach
with Team Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "First time I came over to North America, I was very impressed by
the people and the game itself. I was dreaming to play in the
National Hockey League, but that time, '81, was Cold War and invasion
to Afghanistan, so it wasn't possible. I didn't want to leave my
family and my parents, and my teammates.''</TE>
<TE>   "I spent eight seasons with the Red Army and had huge
accomplishments there with my teammates and team. When Gorbachev took
over in '85, the doors finally started to open up and we had a chance
to play. Most of the guys who I played with, three or four years
older than me, didn't have the chance because they retired age 30,
31."</TE>
<TE>   Larionov had stops with Vancouver and San Jose before he arrived
in Detroit, two months before he turned 35.</TE>
<TE>   He played five seasons with the Red Wings, including championship
teams in 1997 and 1998, before leaving as an unrestricted free agent
to sign with Florida in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Larionov never fit in with the Panthers and the Red Wings made
a trade to bring him back to Detroit on Dec. 28, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a big mistake when [the Red Wings] didn't offer
him a contract or whatever it was," Detroit Coach Scotty Bowman said.
"[Larionov] was pretty miffed about it. I don't blame him. But I
wasn't doing the contracts at that time. I am glad I wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Fellows like Steve Yzerman knew what he was like, and [that] we
were missing him ... We were fortunate to get him back. He has been a
great player for this organization ever since we got him from San
Jose.''</TE>
<TE>   After scoring the biggest goal of his career, Larionov got up
early Sunday morning to watch Russia lose to Japan in the World Cup
and the riot that followed in downtown Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really disappointed," said Larionov, who spoke to his
parents in Russia after the soccer disturbance. "I went to bed at 5
and got up at 8:15 to watch the second half, and we lost.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a democracy now in Russia. Twelve years ago, we didn't have
big screen TVs in downtown Moscow ... I am not like blaming
democracy, don't get me wrong, I like that and I came to this country
because I liked freedom. But sometimes, people watching hockey games,
soccer matches; they go wild. I don't think it's good for the society
... there's a lot of good people, innocent people getting disturbed
by that and to destroy so many businesses in downtown Moscow."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Detroit's Brett Hull, who scored the tying goal to
send Game 3 into overtime, the Red Wings' veteran players were the
difference Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Youth and enthusiasm will take you only so far," said Hull, who
scored the game-winning goal in the second-longest game in finals
history when Dallas defeated Buffalo in Game 6 in 1999. "But if you
look at the people that are mixed in with it, [Pavel] Datsyuk, [Boyd]
Devereaux, [Kris] Draper and [Kirk] Maltby, McCarty, they are not old
guys. You also have [Mathieu] Dandenault and [Jiri] Fischer on
defense. It's such a nice mix of age with inexperience and enthusiasm
and I think that really helps us when you are in a tight situation.''</TE>
<TE>   Hull gives a lot of credit to Yzerman's leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "When he talks, it's like he's about to fall asleep," Hull said.
"He's so calm, but he's so [powerful]. His words just ring loud with
everything he says, and I mean, it's a huge help for the whole
group."</TE>

<KH>U.S. OPEN THURSDAY-SUNDAY, BETHPAGE BLACK COURSE</KH>
<HD>Black Bear</HD>
<DH>Public opinion says this course is as tough as any Open
layout</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>It's big (the longest course in U.S. Open history) and it's bad (the
only course in the world with an actual warning label), but there's
also an element of mystery cloaking Bethpage Black, where the 102nd
Open will be played beginning Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   In a normal U.S. Open setting, you can usually round up the
players who actually have a chance to contend for the title and fill
up maybe two or three golf carts. That's because of the typical Open
course setup is about as heartless as you can get. It is narrow
fairways, tall rough, steep bunkers and greens so hard they make
cement look like cookie dough. Only a few players can successfully
navigate such dire straits.</LD>
<LD>   This is the debate at Bethpage, where for the first time in a long
time, it's shaping up as a wide-open Open.</LD>
<TE>   And that's not just because few really know the layout, a public
course so difficult that there is a sign on the patio behind the
first tee that reads, "Warning: The Black Course Is An Extremely
Difficult Course Which We Recommend Only For Highly Skilled Players."</TE>
<TE>   Rest assured the highly skilled will have their say about that.
Many of the best players come into an Open in top form.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what they will face: Bethpage Black is 7,214 yards, it has
the two longest par fours in U.S. Open history--the 499-yard 12th and
the 492-yard 10th--and it's a par-70 course.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, who played a practice round at Bethpage Black with
Mark O'Meara on May 28, said it's the hardest par-70 course he has
seen. Woods took the last two weeks off after he tied for 22nd at the
Memorial and made his comments on his Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who thinks the winning score will be in double digits
[under par] is crazy," Woods said. "On a couple of holes, you have to
carry the ball 270 yards to reach the fairway. Plus, the fairways are
pretty narrow and the rough is about three inches. It's going to be a
hell of a test. I had a hard time getting to the green from the
rough."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this is music to the ears of the USGA. But if it's hard
for Woods, how hard is it going to be for everyone else?</TE>
<TE>   That sort of revelation levels the playing field, which already is
flat enough.</TE>
<TE>   But while Woods says how difficult the course is, the USGA's own
director of rules and competition, who set up the course, says he
thinks the winning score could be as low as eight under.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Meeks said he was surprised at Woods' comments.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying it's not true [but] maybe I'm underestimating
Bethpage," he said. "I'm not challenging what he's saying, but
players say different things. Sometimes it's to be nice, sometimes
it's sincere, sometimes it's just telling us what we want to hear."</TE>
<TE>   The Bethpage mystery deepens ... Pulverizer or Pushover?</TE>
<TE>   All we know for sure is that it has acquired a reputation worse
than Jack the Ripper, and the main contenders lining up to challenge
the place are at the top of their games.</TE>
<TE>   As a legitimate sports test, this one ranks pretty high.</TE>
<TE>   Woods leads the money list and has the lowest scoring average on
the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Ernie Els is second in putting and fifth in scoring average.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Mickelson is second in earnings, sixth in scoring, ninth in
driving and 10th in putting.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Maria Olazabal is fourth in earnings, second in scoring and
ninth in fourth-round scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Vijay Singh is fifth on the money list, third in scoring and sixth
in reaching greens in regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in players such as David Toms, Colin Montgomerie, Nick
Price, Jim Furyk and even Justin Leonard, Davis Love III and David
Duval, who all seem to be finding their games at the right time, and
chances of picking a winner look harder than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Furyk, who missed the cut two weeks in a row and then
shot 14 under par to win the Memorial with a final-round 65.</TE>
<TE>   Furyk hasn't missed a cut in seven U.S. Opens and has two top-10
finishes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a big confidence builder," Furyk said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Duval, he started with a 75 at the Memorial, but put
together rounds of 69-67-66 to tie for fourth. It was his first
top-10 finish this year. Not long ago, Duval called his year a "train
wreck" but there's a light at the end of the tunnel now.</TE>
<TE>   "I was grinding myself to death," he said. "I'm very much into
quality. I'm just trying to get back to simplicity."</TE>
<TE>   Duval said he was excited to be in a position to win at the
Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a natural feeling," he said. "I felt like I was in the
right place again, the place I expected to be."</TE>
<TE>   Retief Goosen is the defending champion, having defeated Mark
Brooks in an 18-hole playoff at Southern Hills last year. Goosen says
regardless of Bethpage Black's difficulty, he feels ready to go for
it again.</TE>
<TE>   "I see myself as having more of a chance of winning the Open this
time than I did last time," Goosen said. "By winning the Open last
year, I know now that I can play and win under that sort of pressure.
I'm looking forward to what's ahead."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced Bethpage Black is going to be that
tough. Golf Magazine ran a story that questioned its severity with
the teaser headline: "Is Bethpage Too Easy?"</TE>
<TE>   The reasoning behind such a theory is that the greens don't have a
lot of contour. Woods agreed that they're generally flat, but said
they are very difficult to read.</TE>
<TE>   "First, it looks like it breaks one way, then when you walk to the
other side of the hole it looks like it breaks another," he said. "If
the USGA gets them to 13 on the Stimpmeter, which I'm sure they're
planning to do, it's going to be very interesting."</TE>

<HD>Smith Breaks Through at Buick</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARRISON, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Chris Smith wrapped up two long journeys with a breakthrough victory
in the Buick Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, 33, playing the last of six consecutive tournaments, won
his first PGA Tour title Sunday, shooting a one-under-par 71 for a
two-stroke victory.</LD>
<LD>   "It's an awesome feeling," said Smith, tears welling in his eyes
as he walked off the 18th green. "I've struggled all year. My putter
held me in there."</LD>
<TE>   Smith had a 12-under 272 total on the Westchester Country Club's
West Course. The five-time Buy.com Tour winner earned $630,000 and a
tour exemption through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The long-hitting Smith, the ninth first-time winner this year, hit
only four of 14 fairways, but still managed to reach 14 greens in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   David Gossett, Pat Perez and Loren Roberts tied for second, with
Perez shooting a 70, and Gossett and Roberts each shooting a 71.
Stewart Cink (68) and Ian Leggatt (71) finished three strokes back.</TE>

<HD>Diamondbacks Prove Their Worth to Red Sox</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The World Series champions used power and pitching to complete their
sweep of this year's most successful team.</LD>
<LD>   Junior Spivey hit an inside-the-park homer--one of four solo
homers by the Arizona Diamondbacks at Fenway Park--and Rick Helling
pitched them to a 7-3 win Sunday over the Boston Red Sox.</LD>
<LD>   "For three games in a row, this is probably our best streak,"
Diamondback Manager Bob Brenly said.</LD>
<TE>   "Against that lineup, we pitched as well as we could pitch and we
made the plays."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox lead the majors with a .290 batting average, but had
only 22 hits in three games started by Miguel Batista, Curt Schilling
and Helling. They lost, 7-5 and 3-2, then gave up single runs in
seven innings in the finale.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't have come into a season expecting not to lose three
in a row or four in a row or five in a row every once in a while,"
Red Sox Manager Grady Little said.</TE>
<TE>   "But we have a good club. We are 20 games over .500."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its first three-game losing streak of the season and a
15-14 home mark, Boston (40-20) still has the best record in the
majors.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Martinez on Saturday and John Burkett on Sunday each fell to
7-1. They were the last two unbeaten regular starters in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   "Against two undefeated pitchers, to come in and sweep this series
is a lot more than we expected," Mark Grace said.</TE>
<TE>   Spivey hit a ball to left-center field in the seventh that bounced
off the wall as center fielder Johnny Damon crashed into the wall and
fell down.</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Daubach raced to retrieve the ball, but he
slipped.</TE>
<TE>   Daubach's throw was up the third base line and Spivey missed the
plate as he ran by it.</TE>
<TE>   But he went back to touch it for his eighth homer before catcher
Jason Varitek could tag him.</TE>
<TE>   Spivey said he didn't see Daubach slip but did see third base
coach Eddie Rodriguez wave him home.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was going higher off the wall," Spivey said. "I was
going hard all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Gonzalez, Damian Miller and Erubiel Durazo hit solo homers,
and Gonzalez and Grace each doubled in a run.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody would have beaten us today. We didn't play well,"
Boston's Lou Merloni said.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks lead the National League with a 39-23 record and
open a three-game series tonight at Yankee Stadium against the team
they beat in last year's World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Helling said he doesn't look at that series or the Boston series
as a measuring stick.</TE>
<TE>   "We know we have a good team," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we got swept, it wouldn't have meant anything."</TE>
<TE>   Helling (6-5) gave up three runs, seven hits, one walk and struck
out four in 7 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, Helling and Burkett were members of the Texas
rotation in 1998 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   While Burkett revived his career the last two seasons with
Atlanta, Helling had earned-run averages of 4.48 and 5.17 with the
Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Spivey's homer came off reliever Chris Haney with two out in the
seventh and made it 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona took a 1-0 lead in the second on doubles by Spivey and
Grace and made it 2-0 in the third on Gonzalez's leadoff homer, his
13th.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks scored with no out in the fifth on a single by
David Dellucci, who went to third when the ball eluded right fielder
Trot Nixon for an error, and a double by Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona got a run in the sixth when Tony Womack singled, stole
second and scored on a single by Craig Counsell.</TE>

<HD>Kostecki Makes a Winner Out of Illbruck</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICH ROBERTS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KIEL, Germany</DL>
<LD>Illbruck, a German boat with an American skipper, won the eighth
running of the Volvo Ocean Race on Sunday by finishing second behind
the surprising Norwegian winner on the last of nine legs from
Gothenburg, Sweden, to this lively port on Germany's Baltic coast.</LD>
<LD>   And now that John Kostecki, Olympic silver medallist and winner of
10 world sailing championships, has reached a new peak in his career,
what's next?</LD>
<LD>   "Uh, couch potato," he replied.</LD>
<TE>   It has been a long 8 1/2 months since Kostecki, 37, and crew set
out in their 64-foot sloop from Southampton in southern England in
the sport's premier offshore event.</TE>
<TE>   Forgive him if he kicks back a while to, oh, go sailing. He needs
time to reflect on a finely tuned effort that made him the second
consecutive American skipper to lead such a victory, following Paul
Cayard's success with Sweden's EF Language in 1997-98.</TE>
<TE>   "The second San Franciscan!" Kostecki corrected a reporter. But he
also has become one of Germany's most popular sports figures. The
people aboard the hundreds of spectator boats and another estimated
120,000 lining the shore won't give him up easily.</TE>
<TE>   Like Cayard, Kostecki was the only American in a multinational
effort, in Kostecki's case a German boat that had only one
German--bowman Tony Kolb--but half a crew of New Zealanders and a
Spanish navigator, Juan Vila. The program, sponsored by the German
company that produces materials for the construction industry, was
built on a year and a half of training, testing and sail development
that launched illbruck to an early commanding lead that proved
insurmountable to some capable rivals--most notably, Assa Abloy.</TE>
<TE>   Over the 32,700 nautical miles that included two romps through the
turbulent Southern Ocean, two boats--SEB, of Sweden, and Amer Sports
Too--lost their masts, while SEB and Bermuda's Tyco broke their
rudders. Even illbruck almost sank in rough seas when a bow hatch
cover broke the first night out of Cape Town in November.</TE>
<TE>   Illbruck recovered to win that leg, as well as three others, and
was the only boat of the eight with no finish worse than fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The all-woman crew of Amer Sports Too finally gained some glory
Sunday by finishing fourth on the last leg--the first time they had
finished ahead of anyone.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Assa Abloy, which won three legs, was the only boat
illbruck had to worry about. The boat backed by the Swedish lock
company had the most American crew with three Yanks: navigator and
co-skipper Mark Rudiger, also of San Francisco; tactician-helmsman
Chris Larson of Annapolis, Md., and all-round veteran Mike Howard of
Malibu. Assa Abloy outsailed illbruck on the race's shorter legs
before it fell short on the shortest of all, finishing third and
nearly two hours behind illbruck.</TE>
<TE>   The 220 nautical miles from Gothenburg to Kiel was ripe for
surprises, with its light and shifty winds and swirling tidal
currents, but it was home waters to Norway's djuice.</TE>
<TE>   The pink-and-black boat hadn't beaten anyone but the women on six
of the eight earlier legs but, heeding forecasts for light wind,
removed three of its 12 crew members and all excess sails and
equipment to lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed to pay off. Skipper Knut Frostad said, "The night before
I had some dreams about winning. We were just so fast it was
unbelievable. For the first time in the race we were the fastest
boat!"</TE>
<TE>   It was also satisfying for the women to beat Amer Sports One,
their partner in the Nautor program, by about 250 meters.</TE>
<TE>   Skipper Lisa McDonald said, "It was a nice way to finish for the
team because we always knew we had it in us."</TE>

<HD>FIFA Can't Hide From Failings</HD>

<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Children are an integral part of Asia's first World Cup, just as they
have been in the last several tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   Before each of the 64 matches in Korea/Japan '02, it is children
who carry the yellow Fair Play banner onto the field, and it is
children from around the world who stand in front of the players as
they line up for the national anthems.</LD>
<LD>   Children are something useful for FIFA to hide behind. Children
project an image of innocence. There is nothing corrupt about
children, so therefore there must be nothing corrupt about world
soccer's ruling body.</LD>
<TE>   Sadly, the truth is just the opposite.</TE>
<TE>   The latest World Cup is not yet two weeks old and already the ugly
side of FIFA has been seen, albeit briefly, when the public relations
facade was peeled back and the truth was revealed by FIFA's actions,
not by its words.</TE>
<TE>   First there was the matter of the pirated television images of
World Cup games being shown in North Korea. No one is sure how the
North Koreans got the videotapes, but FIFA demanded an investigation.</TE>
<TE>   It wanted impoverished North Korea, a land where another corrupt
regime holds sway, to be financially accountable--in other words, to
pay for broadcast rights. That simply would not happen.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of seeing the opportunity to use sport to open doors that
politicians have failed miserably to open, the money-grubbing men of
FIFA saw only lost revenue. Shame on them.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the matter of Rivaldo, the Brazilian forward who
made a mockery of fair play during Brazil's game against Turkey. When
a Turkish player fired the ball at Rivaldo, who was waiting to take a
corner kick, it was clear to everyone that the ball hit his leg.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Rivaldo crumpled backward clutching at his face and remained
on the ground, feigning injury. South Korean referee Kim Young-Joo
bought it and ejected the Turkish player, Hakan Unsal, meaning that
the Turks had to play a man short and that Unsal would miss the next
game.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Rivaldo admitted that he faked injury intentionally to
get Unsal red-carded. Fair play? You bet.</TE>
<TE>   "[FIFA] told us that any action designed to fool a referee would
be punished, but it's our players who are being punished," said Haluk
Ulusoy, president of the Turkish soccer federation.</TE>
<TE>   The outrage caused by the incident was widespread--everywhere but
in Brazil, naturally--and FIFA was widely expected to suspend
Rivaldo, thus handing him the same punishment his unsportsmanlike
behavior had inflicted on Unsal.</TE>
<TE>   Not a chance. FIFA buckled under the pressure of not wanting to
harm the four-time world champions and Rivaldo was given a $7,350
fine. The amount is pocket change to a millionaire player.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, FIFA served its image, not the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, and most odious of all, there is the matter of Mohammed
Bin Hammam, a FIFA executive committee member from Qatar and a key
ally of FIFA President Joseph "Sepp" Blatter in his recent successful
reelection bid.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that World Cup tickets that Bin Hammam had purchased
for the upcoming Sweden-Argentina game somehow ended up on the black
market, where they were bought for $500 over their face value.</TE>
<TE>   Five hundred dollars might not seem like much except for the fact
that FIFA executive committee members are allowed to buy as many
tickets as they want at face value. The guideline says there is a
limit of 10, but it is only a guideline, not a rule.</TE>
<TE>   Bin Hammam has left the World Cup and returned to Qatar, where he
has been supplied the serial numbers of the tickets in question and
has been asked to investigate how they might have shown up on the
black market.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, he has been given time to concoct a story that
FIFA can pass off as the truth. The groundwork already has been laid.</TE>
<TE>   "The general secretary has been in touch with Bin Hammam and he
was totally, genuinely shocked and amazed; totally at a loss to
understand it," FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   The general secretary, of course, is Michel Zen-Ruffinen, the man
who maintains that corruption is rife within world soccer's ruling
body and who, because he tried to expose that corruption, has been
fired by Blatter, effective July 4.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer is a beautiful sport, one that has aroused passions around
the globe for three-quarters of a century. Because of the huge
interest, the sport is a money-spinner for those who control it.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, those who control it are more interested in lining
their own pockets than in the sport itself. Yet soccer prevails.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, thousands of fans lined up outside the World Cup
Stadium in Daegu, waiting for the chance to buy one of 5,000 tickets
that were to be made available at 6 a.m. Monday for the South
Korea-United States game.</TE>
<TE>   Their number included many children, innocent, every one. And each
one with more moral fiber than all of FIFA's leaders combined.</TE>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>This may seem hard to believe now, but Andre Agassi once had problems
with the media, an eon ago.</LD>
<LD>   He was fairly cooperative in his post-match news conferences but
drew extremely harsh criticism from the national media for lack of
access and other assorted perceived sins.</LD>
<LD>   It got nasty, at times. So when Agassi had a highly publicized
spat in his match against Petr Korda at the U.S. Open in 1990,
spitting at chair umpire Wayne McKewen, he had no reservoir of
goodwill to rely on, and got crushed by the media in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Something changed shortly thereafter. Suddenly, Agassi became
available in Las Vegas, even picking up columnist Scott Ostler at the
airport and introducing himself. Whether it was Agassi's personal
decision or one by his then-management company, the openness slowly
started to change his image.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, Agassi has converted nearly all of his media critics,
and it has helped immensely that he has grown up and matured into a
special person. Of course, no athlete is going to have a perfect
batting average in these dealings.</TE>
<TE>   This remarkable image-changing effort came to mind in a recent
situation. The problems Venus and Serena Williams have dealt with had
more to do with their colleagues on the tour, and last year, with the
public at Indian Wells. The family was booed during Serena's final
against Kim Clijsters, triggered by the fans' lasting anger over
Venus' last-minute withdrawal (because of a knee injury) about five
minutes before her scheduled semifinal against Serena. The Williams
sisters haven't gone back to Indian Wells. Serena had indicated that
there might be a chance, but her mother and coach Oracene has seemed
more doubtful, wanting to hear directly from tournament officials,
presumably Charlie Pasarell and Ray Moore.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian Wells experience did change things, however. When Venus
withdrew from the Italian Open shortly before a scheduled night match
against Anna Kournikova this spring, she defused the controversy by
explaining the situation, answering about three questions from the
tournament director who translated her answers into Italian for the
crowd. There was polite applause.</TE>
<TE>   Here, not only did Venus take pictures of the champion Serena
after their final on Saturday at the French Open, but she sat in the
WTA media center with a few American reporters after the loss,
answering questions for about 15 minutes. This would have been
unthinkable after previous defeats.</TE>
<TE>   Venus spoke about how difficult her initiation was on the tour.
Talented newcomers often get treated poorly, almost hazed by the
other players--remember how it was for Steffi Graf and Monica
Seles?--but Williams had it particularly rough.</TE>
<TE>   "At the beginning, it was a little bit difficult because they were
always saying, 'They're this and they're that,' " Venus said. "It was
hard. I don't even try to counteract what the next person says
because it's not possible. There were a lot of people out there
formulating opinions without actually knowing Serena and I, which I
find difficult to do unless you know that person.</TE>
<TE>   "So, I think I've learned a lot from that not to judge people just
from my own life."</TE>
<TE>   She has had Serena as an ally, but the sisters didn't seem to make
an effort with the players or the media in the early days. One
reporter remembered that Venus and Serena were hardly responsive in
an interview in Australia a few years ago, handing a magazine back
and forth to one another and blowing off legend Evonne Goolagong.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, it doesn't take much to build media goodwill. Andy
Roddick received some negative press at last year's French Open, and
instead of boycotting certain writers, he held a session with the
media and cleared the air. Whether it was solely his decision, the
ATP's or his management agency, it was a move that should be followed
more often.</TE>
<TE>   Serena also met with the media after her victory on Saturday and
talked about the different perception. Earlier, she joined the crowd
and applauded Jennifer Capriati when Capriati walked off the court
after her three-set semifinal loss to Serena. Additionally, she took
a leadership role on the tour, speaking out against the decision of
French Open officials to put the women's quarterfinals on a secondary
venue, Court Suzanne Lenglen.</TE>
<TE>   "It has changed," Serena said. "People realize that not only are
we good players, but we're really gracious."</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was muted in its support in the final between Venus and
Serena, not sure how to react to the sloppy match. It might take a
few more Grand Slam finals, or a decent match between the sisters, to
engage the fans. The emergence of the sisters as individuals, not
being viewed solely as a unit, will likely help.</TE>
<TE>   "When we first played, it was, 'Go Williams,' " Serena said. "Now,
it's like I heard a lot of people yelling for Venus today and for me
too. I think people could relate to whichever personality fits them
best and what game they like more."</TE>
<TE>   Serena joked that she also had problems separating herself from
Venus.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to think I was Venus," she said. "I used to do everything
she did. I thought I liked the things she liked. Then I realized, 'I
don't like tomatoes. I don't like mushrooms.' I had to realize I was
a different person. I'm not eating them anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It all has to start somewhere, right?</TE>
<TE>   "From little things like that to big things," Serena said. "I
realized I'm totally different than she is."</TE>

<HD>Parks Saves Costa Rica</HD>
<DH>Soccer: His late goal ties Turkey, 1-1, leaving both teams
with visions of advancing to the second round. Brazil clinches its
spot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With one shot, Winston Parks set off celebrations in two countries
Sunday as his goal for Costa Rica four minutes from the end of its
game against Turkey earned the Central Americans a 1-1 tie and, at
the same time, secured Brazil its place in the second round.</LD>
<LD>   The Turks, who had lost their opener controversially to Brazil on
a late penalty kick, appeared headed for victory in the Group C game
played in front of 42,299 in Incheon, South Korea.</LD>
<LD>   Midfielder Emre Belozoglu gave Turkey the lead in the 56th minute,
taking a pass from Hasas Sas and, with his second attempt after the
first shot was blocked, beat Costa Rica goalkeeper Erick Lonnis.</LD>
<TE>   Costa Rica Coach Alexandre Guimaraes, whose team had defeated
China in its opener, sent Park into the game for Wilmer Lopez in the
77th minute and the substitution paid dividends nine minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo Wanchope rose to win a head ball and in the scramble that
followed Parks hammered a shot past Turkish keeper Rustu Recber to
earn Costa Rica a precious point.</TE>
<TE>   A tie against Brazil on Thursday or failure by Turkey to win its
finale against China will push Costa Rica into the round of 16.</TE>
<TE>   "My team played a beautiful game tonight, with so much power and
aggression," Guimaraes said. "Every player wants to play Brazil at a
World Cup, and now that we have four points and are in a good
position, we are going to do our best to get another point and reach
the next round."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's chances are very much alive, however. It is a stronger
team than China and if it can score enough goals it can overtake
Costa Rica and grab second place on goal difference, assuming Costa
Rica loses to Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   "We are confident we are going to beat China and wait for the
right result [from the other game] and we can go through," said
Turkey Coach Senol Gunes.</TE>

<DL>DAEGU, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Cracks are appearing in the ranks of the United States' third World
Cup opponent, Poland. A 2-0 upset loss to South Korea left the
players questioning one another's commitment and Coach Jerzy Engel's
instructions.</LD>
<LD>   "If we want to win, we have to change our tactics," midfielder
Marek Kozminski said.</LD>
<LD>   The criticism is not limited to those Poles in Korea. Several at
home have voiced their displeasure too.</LD>
<TE>   "We got what we deserved," former national team goalkeeper Jan
Tomaszewski told the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. "The form we
showed was the result of eight months of antitraining.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had played against Korea the way we did in qualifying, I
wouldn't mind. Then, we had a team and now we don't because it has

<DH>Volleyball: Hannemann, Nygaard win their initial title in
only their second tournament together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It had been a while since Albert Hannemann won a tournament on the
Assn. of Volleyball Professionals tour.</LD>
<LD>   Like, forever.</LD>
<LD>   In his 10th AVP season and 158th pro tournament, Hannemann finally
broke through, winning a scintillating final Sunday at the Hermosa
Beach Open with partner Jeff Nygaard.</LD>
<TE>   It took a monumental effort--Hannemann and Nygaard fought off nine
match points in the third game--but in the end, they pulled off an
18-21, 29-27, 27-25 victory over top-seeded Kevin Wong and Stein
Metzger, enthralling a standing-room only crowd that lined up seven
or eight rows deep at the entryways to center court.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got so many chills, every time we made a great play," said
Hannemann, who played at UCLA in 1988 and 1989 before transferring to
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Nygaard, a former middle blocker at UCLA and two-time member of
the U.S. Olympic indoor team, ended the match with a kill that gave
the newly formed duo their first title in only their second
tournament together.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, are you kidding me?" Hannemann said. "This was great."</TE>
<TE>   That Hannemann and Nygaard were in the championship match was
somewhat surprising ... and perhaps a trifle lucky.</TE>
<TE>   Hannemann and Nygaard were losing to Scott Ayakatubby and Brian
Lewis in the semifinals when Lewis injured his right quadriceps while
jumping to hit the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis and Ayakatubby had won the first game, 21-15, and were
trailing the second, 9-7, but they had to forfeit because Lewis could
not continue.</TE>
<TE>   "Haley's Comet was aligned perfectly around Jupiter and my
astrological sign was saying it was going to be a good day for me,"
Nygaard quipped. "I'm not going to say we weren't lucky, but it took
a lot of heart for us to win this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said it was doubtful he would play in the Santa Barbara
Open, which begins Friday with qualifying rounds.</TE>
<TE>   After a solid Saturday, Karch Kiraly and Brent Doble faded Sunday,
losing to Hannemann and Nygaard in the winners' semifinals and
getting bounced from the double-elimination tournament by Eduardo
Bacil and Frederico Souza in the consolation bracket. Kiraly and
Doble tied for fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "We played a little better [Saturday] than we did today,
unfortunately," Kiraly said.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Fonoimoana and Dax Holdren also had a rough day, losing to
Ayakatubby and Lewis in the consolation bracket. Fonoimoana and
Holdren could do no wrong two weeks ago in winning the Huntington
Beach Open, but they faltered at Hermosa and tied for fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "We had very few blocks this week," Fonoimoana said. "If that's
going to happen, we need to have a lot of digs and that didn't
happen."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Holly McPeak and Elaine Youngs won the women's tournament, as
expected.</TE>
<TE>   They've been together barely a month, but McPeak and Youngs
dominated their second consecutive AVP event, going 5-0 and defeating
Barbra Fontana and Dianne DeNecochea, 21-15, 21-14, for the
championship.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, McPeak and Youngs needed three games to defeat
Fontana and DeNecochea for the Huntington Beach Open title.
Perfection has come quickly for McPeak and Youngs, who have lost only
that one game in 10 AVP matches together.</TE>
<TE>   "We were disappointed with the way we played [at Huntington] a
little bit," Youngs said. "Holly and I wouldn't be where we're at
without being perfectionists."</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs spent the last two weeks working on their
serving and their approach to the net while hitting. They felt they
attacked too tentatively at Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Not so much Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We were way more aggressive," McPeak said. "I felt much more
comfortable."</TE>

<TE>   On Saturday afternoon, Oxnard cousins Miguel Angel
Naranjo-Sanchez, 40, and Juan Carlos Rodriguez-Puente, 18, were
killed when their Subaru station wagon was hit head-on by a Chevy
minivan on 5th Street, near Camarillo Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The two died of blunt-force head injuries, said Mitch Breese,
county senior deputy medical examiner.</TE>
<TE>   Naranjo-Sanchez and Rodriguez-Puente, who were farm workers, lived
across the street from each other, Breese said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Solano, 25, and Maria Magallanez, 30, of Los Angeles and
their four children were injured in the collision. Magallanez was
listed in critical condition at Ventura County Medical Center, where
Solano was being treated for moderate injuries.</TE>

Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth child was released Sunday from St. John's Regional

<HD>County Seeks to Restore Public Trust</HD>
<DH>Corruption: San Bernardino officials hope that a civil
trial will finally put to rest a scandal that began with trash
contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At times, the San Bernardino County corruption scandal has seemed
downright silly, like when court documents showed one political
operative hunting for a "marginally honest" private investigator to
assist an election campaign.</LD>
<LD>   But in the beginning it was about trash--and it was very serious.
Corruption in San Bernardino County's halls of power was so common
that many considered it a part of everyday business, as natural as a
power lunch.</LD>
<LD>   A series of kickback scandals, starting when a trash executive
bribed a county bureaucrat to win an exclusive landfill contract,
severely tarnished public trust in government.</LD>
<TE>   This week, a new wave of county officials bent on reform will go
to court to get that trust back. Frustrated that criminal proceedings
have yielded only minor sentences for even major players, they will
embark on a monthlong civil lawsuit against 13 businesses, executives
and former county officials.</TE>
<TE>   They know the trial, moved to Ventura County because of heavy
publicity back home, will dredge up painful memories of those years
of corruption. And they hope the case will put those memories out to
pasture once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing has been a burden on just about everybody in the
county, from the Board of Supervisors to the employees, since it came
to light in 1999," said Chief Deputy County Counsel Michael Sachs.
"We're looking forward to finally getting it resolved and behind us."</TE>
<TE>   The county, if it succeeds in proving its complicated case, is
expected to demand damages of more than $6.5 million, officials said.
But ultimately the reward may be less tangible than a check. It may
be old-fashioned revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The county initially sued 22 individuals and businesses in June
2000 to recoup money lost to corruption over the years, then filed
additional lawsuits later. Various defendants in those suits have
reached out-of-court settlements totaling about $21 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Icing on the Cake'</TE>
<TE>   Many of the remaining defendants, including former county
officials, say they have no money.</TE>
<TE>   "There is little likelihood that they currently have any assets to
satisfy any judgment," Sachs said. "In our mind, we've already got
the money that we were able to get. This would be icing on the cake.
At a minimum, these folks whom the county thinks did not get their
just deserts in the criminal arena may have significant judgments
hanging over their heads for the rest of their lives."</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the county's corruption investigation has spun
off a series of new, loosely related charges: that San Bernardino
County Dist. Atty. Dennis Stout secretly aided a candidate
challenging a political rival, for example, and that county
Supervisor Jerry Eaves' relatives and aides received free junkets to
the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Though serious, the newer charges were seen by many as politically
driven--and hardly of the same caliber as the initial allegations
produced by an extensive probe involving local and federal
investigators. The case will focus largely on three separate
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   According to the county, between 1996 and 1998, former Chief
Administrative Officer Harry Mays and businessman Kenneth James Walsh
paid $227,000 to bribe Mays' successor as the county's top
bureaucrat. The bribes, county attorneys say, ensured that Walsh's
business, Norcal Solid Waste Systems Inc., would have an exclusive
contract to operate county landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Mays then billed Norcal $4.3 million for his services, Sachs
said--and kicked back $1.5 million to Walsh. The Norcal contracts
were worth as much as $50 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "Mays' compensation was tied to the performance of the Norcal
contract," Sachs said. "Mays perceived Walsh as the one who was
essential to making Norcal a success. He paid Mr. Walsh to keep him
around, to keep him happy."</TE>
<TE>   In a related deal, Sachs said, a dirt hauler paid Walsh, Mays and
Mays' successor, James Hlawek, a total of $220,000 to retain
subcontracting work from Norcal and the county. And Hlawek forced the
county to buy out another contractor for $4 million--money the county
should not have had to spend, Sachs said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Focus on Leases</TE>
<TE>   The county also will focus on two controversial leases. Hlawek has
admitted in sworn testimony that Mays offered him $60,000 in cash to
usher through a contract requiring the county to lease a former Kmart
in Rialto.</TE>
<TE>   The building, which the county turned into a mental health clinic
in 1998, was leased for $26 million--but the lease was never
subjected to competitive bids, and cost far more than the market
dictates in that area, officials contend. Mays was an owner of the
building, county attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   The county also paid $7.6 million to lease a building owned by
Dionysius Properties, another company with ties to Mays that is a
defendant in the case. That lease was also tainted by bribes, the
county alleges.</TE>
<TE>   The county claims that an Orange County businessman, W. Shepardson
"Shep" McCook, paid Hlawek $35,000 as part of a deal to alter a lease
connected to a series of giant billboards in Colton, near Interstates
215 and 10. In 1997, McCook's company, Oakridge Corp., netted $4.3
million through a related transaction that county officials believe
was tainted by the payment to Hlawek, Sachs said.</TE>
<TE>   Most defendants and their lawyers either could not be reached or
did not return telephone calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, questioned whether the county's charges will stick.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Schaefer, a San Bernardino lawyer who represents McCook,
pointed out that a judge has already tossed out part of the case
against his client. The judge suggested that the county did not
suffer a financial loss through the billboard deal--and therefore
could not recover damages.</TE>
<TE>   Schaefer said he expects to argue the same point in the lawsuit.
He said the alleged bribe is an issue for criminal court. In civil
court, the county's arguments must focus entirely on money taxpayers
lost because of corruption--and in this case, taxpayers lost nothing,
Schaefer said.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if he paid the money to Hlawek, the county is not entitled
to get a check from McCook," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the principals who have pleaded guilty to related criminal
charges have been given light sentences, county officials say. Walsh,
for example, considered a key player in the scandal, could have been
sentenced to a five-year prison term and a $250,000 fine. Instead, he
got 18 months; he served 16 months before his release in February and
was not fined.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal courts have been lenient on these guys," said county
Supervisor Fred Aguiar. "We're hoping that in a civil court, justice
will be served."</TE>
<TE>   Aguiar also expressed relief that the case is coming to trial.</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, question the commitment to ridding San Bernardino
County of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Critical of County</TE>
<TE>   Ed Scott, a former candidate for county supervisor who helped
expose what critics have called corruption in the district attorney's
office, criticized the county's recent decision to remove four
veteran sheriff's investigators from an anti-corruption task force.</TE>
<TE>   "I think, unfortunately, the county hasn't regained the public
trust," said Scott, a Republican candidate hoping to unseat
Assemblyman John Longville (D-Rialto).</TE>
<TE>   "The recent removal of the sheriff's officers out of the task
force is just further proof that the county is not interested in
cleaning up corruption."</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, said Mike Cardwell, deputy chief of the San
Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, the decision to reassign the
officers is a sign that the investigation is winding down.</TE>
<TE>   "That is not to say, unfortunately, that there is no more
corruption in the county," Cardwell said. "... The remaining cases
that could be investigated are fewer and less significant than the
array of cases we were looking at three years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators will be freed up any time a development comes along,
Cardwell said.</TE>

<LD>   What's good for the goose is good for the gander. We're not
talking here about farm geese, but farm workers.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, we're also talking about money and how it influences
politicians. This episode has all the markings of a classic case.</LD>
<TE>   The principal difference between the goose and the gander--two
distinct groups of farm workers--is that one gives politicians money
and the other does not.</TE>
<TE>   Let's begin by turning back several pages.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985, government officials investigated California racetracks
and found that backstretch workers--grooms, manure shovelers--were
being cheated out of overtime pay. Horse trainers were ordered to pay
back wages.</TE>
<TE>   But the horse-racing industry was a big-time player in Sacramento,
a major donor of campaign money. It pushed through legislation
reclassifying the stable hands as agriculture workers, thus
effectively exempting them from overtime pay.</TE>
<TE>   Now skip ahead to 2000. The dusty, cramped, unsanitary conditions
of underpaid backstretch workers--who live on the job--have
deteriorated even further. Meanwhile, track profits have sunk to
dangerous lows because of increasing competition from Indian casinos
and card clubs.</TE>
<TE>   The solution: a union for the stable hands; Internet and telephone
betting for the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Bingo. That bill sails through the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   But it's vetoed by Gov. Gray Davis, who fears "a significant
expansion of gambling." The governor says, however, he'd sign a bill
if it only protected track workers "from being subjected to dismal
living and working conditions."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, labor and tracks unite again. They sponsor a bill to
permit collective bargaining--and binding arbitration if there's an
impasse--coupled, once more, with Internet and telephone wagering.</TE>
<TE>   There's scarcely a no vote in the Legislature. Davis signs the
bill, explaining that a new federal law already has expanded gambling
and this measure merely protects California's interests.</TE>
<TE>   But let's be honest: It's also a fact that some interests had been
betting wisely on certain politicians. The horse-racing industry had
donated at least $189,000 to Davis since he took office and poured
money all over the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The Service Employees International Union, representing the stable
hands, had donated $1.2 million to legislative candidates during the
2000 elections. Three days before Davis signed the bill on Aug. 13,
2001, the SEIU gave him $100,000. It added another $200,000 in
December.</TE>
<TE>   Return to the present.</TE>
<TE>   The United Farm Workers union has been watching all this. If those
racetrack "farm workers" can get binding arbitration--a coveted
bargaining tool--why can't the real farm workers? Field hands often
face even more "dismal living and working conditions"--to quote
Davis--than do stable hands.</TE>
<TE>   Good for the goose, good for the gander.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW, founded by the late Cesar Chavez, believes that binding
arbitration would force growers into labor contracts. Since 1975,
when agriculture workers were given the right to unionize and
collectively bargain, there have been 428 employee elections to join
the UFW and negotiate a contract. But only 185 contracts have been
signed.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW blames foot-dragging growers, many negotiating in bad
faith. Some talks date back to the '70s.</TE>
<TE>   The farm lobby concedes a handful of growers may be guilty, but
insists this doesn't justify punishing an entire industry with a
draconian measure that exists in no other private enterprise. Except,
of course, horse racing.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW solution was dreamed up by political consultant Richie
Ross, a onetime strike organizer for Chavez. A bill by Senate leader
John Burton (D-San Francisco) was amended to simply grant all farm
workers--track and field--the same binding arbitration rights.</TE>
<TE>   The bill barely passed the Senate, 21-13. Most Democrats voted for
it, Republicans against. It's now in the Assembly, unnerving moderate
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The centrist governor, who tries to walk both sides of the farm
fence, has sent signals he'll probably veto the bill if it passes.
But he'd rather it just disappear while he's running for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   The agriculture industry is circling the wagons. "We're not going
to tolerate this," says Roy Gabriel, lobbyist for the California Farm
Bureau Federation.</TE>
<TE>   "Horse racing got off-track betting as a trade-off. What do we
get?"</TE>
<TE>   Good point. On the racetrack bill, employers and employees were
united because they both benefited. That's one difference.</TE>
<TE>   But the other difference is that the UFW--unlike the SEIU--does
not contribute campaign money. The farm lobby does.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see whether the goose and the gander are equal in the eyes
of politicians.</TE>

<DH>Church: For some lay Catholics, allegations against priests
signal a huge shift. Others say they have seen worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mary Ellen Burton-Christie is angry about the way Roman Catholic
leaders have handled the church's sex scandals, and she used her
weekly offering Sunday to express her displeasure: She wrote "parish
only" on her check, withholding her money from the Los Angeles
Archdiocese in an attempt to spark change in the church hierarchy.</LD>
<LD>   Salvador Hernandez said he was saddened, not angered, by the
scandals and would not take it out on the archdiocese. Instead, he
helped organize a massive rally Saturday that drew hundreds of Latino
Catholics into downtown Los Angeles streets singing hymns and waving
signs proclaiming support for their faith, their priests, the abuse
victims and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony.</LD>
<LD>   Burton-Christie, who is white, and Hernandez, a Latino, are
faithful Catholics who express deep love for their church and
distress over its woes. But their responses underscore dramatic
differences in how the archdiocese's 5 million Catholics are reacting
to the crisis. These differences are often visible through three
prisms: whites versus Latinos, immigrants versus U.S. natives, and
the affluent versus the working class.</LD>
<TE>   Catholics in some largely white, affluent congregations report
moves in their churches to withhold offerings, boycott Mass, demand
more lay input in selecting priests and other attempts at change.
Many describe themselves as part of an awakened laity that is
demanding equal status with clergy, rather than being "spoon-fed"
church policy.</TE>
<TE>   "This may mark another seismic shift in the rise of the laity,"
said Claire Henning, pastoral coordinator for St. Paul the Apostle
Church in Los Angeles. She likened the moment to 1968, when American
Catholics widely rejected church teachings by disregarding a new
papal encyclical that reaffirmed the church's ban on artificial birth
control.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Paul the Apostle, which Henning said has sponsored three
forums on priestly abuse in the last few months, the most significant
outcome so far has been the outpouring of conversation about the need
to challenge church hierarchy on everything from financial
accountability to rules barring married priests and women clergy.
Contributions have dipped 3% to 4%, she said. Lay leaders in other
churches report cuts as deep as 20%, along with demands to allocate
money to the parish and not the archdiocesan hierarchy, or to nuns
and not priests.</TE>
<TE>   Burton-Christie, a parish council member at St. Agatha Church in
Los Angeles, said she began to withhold her Sunday offerings from the
archdiocese--which takes out 8% of parish collections--because "it's
one of the few tools I have to get my message across."</TE>
<TE>   She envisions a church in which leaders such as Mahony start
treating the laity as "equal brothers and sisters." She said she is
perturbed that Mahony has written at least two letters on the scandal
to "my brother priests," leaving out the laity. Partly in response,
she is drafting a letter inviting Mahony to embrace the laity as well
by appearing for a discussion on the issue at St. Agatha.</TE>
<TE>   "If Mahony came to a meeting and sat with the people and
apologized to the people, it would be transformative in our
relationship with the hierarchy in the church," said Burton-Christie,
a longtime community organizer and spiritual director who, like
Henning, is pursuing a master's degree in pastoral studies at Loyola
Marymount University.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Agatha, a small group of parishioners has started
boycotting Masses. But Burton-Christie said widespread goodwill has
also been voiced, along with an eagerness to engage the church
hierarchy in moves to make the church more open, accountable and
faithful.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rallies and Vigils</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos, who make up 70% of the Catholics in the Los Angeles
Archdiocese, the general response seems strikingly different. Since
the scandal broke in January, the community has held rallies, marches
and vigils in support of the church--including Saturday's march
sponsored by the evangelical Latino organization El Sembrador.</TE>
<TE>   Latino priests in immigrant and Americanized churches say they
have seen no moves to withhold contributions, boycott Mass or demand
engagement with church leaders on issues such as celibacy or women's
ordination. At the march, several Latinos said they were saddened and
disappointed by the scandals, but they did not voice anger.</TE>
<TE>   And although many supported the idea of zero tolerance--ousting
from the priesthood anyone found to have abused minors--not one
focused blame for the problem on the church hierarchy, pointing
instead to wayward individual priests.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Govea, a 39-year-old Mexican native and foreman at a Southgate
floor-mat firm, said he did not know why church authorities handled
the problem as they did, and "those who don't know shouldn't talk."</TE>
<TE>   "They have their motives," he said. "Although I can't support the
priests who molested the children, it's not right to judge or point
fingers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't follow the priests," he said. "I follow Jesus Christ. I
don't follow man because men are not perfect."</TE>
<TE>   According to Father Vicente Lopez of St. Raphael Church in Los
Angeles, many Latino faithful, especially immigrants, continue to
defer to church leadership as an extension of a paternalistic
culture, embrace even fallen priests as family, and see the furor as
an attack on their faith reminiscent of the long years of persecution
against the church in their ancestral Latin American homelands.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fighting Persecution</TE>
<TE>   Humberto Ramos, who served for 15 years in the archdiocesan
Hispanic ministry, said that feeling of persecution is particularly
strong among Mexicans from Jalisco and other central plateau states,
which provide large numbers of immigrants to Los Angeles. In the
1920s, he said, the region's Catholics took up arms to defend the
church against government persecution, producing 25 martyrs who were
canonized as saints two years ago. Today, he said, many of them see
the same need to take action to support their besieged church.</TE>
<TE>   Ramos said rural Latino immigrants have long learned to maintain a
religious life without priests. In some rural Mexican communities, he
said, priests manage to visit and celebrate Mass only three times a
year--helping to produce a religious life based more on lay prayer
gatherings and feast day celebrations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet here, too, American assimilation complicates the response.</TE>
<TE>   In the Sandoval family of Corona, opinions diverge between mother
Maria, a Mexican immigrant, and daughter Maria, an American-born
junior high school teacher. Both women, who attended the Saturday
rally with the rest of their family, said they would not consider
withholding donations or boycotting Mass, and retain trust in Mahony
and other leadership.</TE>
<TE>   But daughter Maria said she fully supported ousting abusive
priests, while mother Maria did not, saying they should be treated
with therapy and returned to ministry after repentance and recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very upset that people are making the scandal bigger than
it is, and people are accusing innocent priests," mother Maria said.</TE>
<TE>   At St. Anne Church in Santa Monica, Father Michael Gutierrez said
some immigrants in the largely Latino congregation still retain
traditional attitudes of not challenging church authority. But
Gutierrez, a U.S. native, said he learned to speak out growing up in
the largely white community of Diamond Bar and is teaching his
congregation the need to do the same. He said, however, that issues
of church authority and hierarchy probably rank "fifth or sixth" on
his congregation's list of priorities.</TE>
<TE>   African American Catholics pose another cultural complexity.
Father Gregory Chisholm, a black Jesuit priest who leads the
predominantly African American church of Holy Name of Jesus in
South-Central Los Angeles, said the most prevalent emotion among his
flock was distress that the scandal has made Catholicism seem yet
again a strange cult to their overwhelmingly Protestant black
community.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Life on the Cusp</TE>
<TE>   Many non-Catholic blacks, he said, are openly skeptical about the
Roman rites, devotions and practices of priestly celibacy. The
scandal has placed many of his congregants in a defensive position,
as they "live on the cusp" between Catholics and the black community.</TE>
<TE>   Blacks, like Mexicans, also remember far worse times in the church
that help them place the current scandal in perspective. While the
scandals may pose the biggest crisis in modern times to white
Catholics, Chisholm said, blacks have long suffered more direct
iniquities, such as church support of slavery and Jim Crow laws. In
the 1930s, he said, his own parents were met at the door of a Harlem
church by the white priest and told to go worship with the black
congregation down the street.</TE>
<TE>   "To be [black] Catholics in light of the history of this racism
means we've had to go through much worse than bishops not doing what
the gospel calls us to do," Chisholm said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the church's religious services are as exuberant as
ever and that pledges to the archdiocesan "Together in Mission"
annual fund-raising appeal have actually increased since February.</TE>
<TE>   Such diversity has long defined the Roman Catholic Church. The
European immigrants who made up the early American church brought
with them a tradition of unquestioning support of clerical
authorities. This eventually gave way to American offspring who
challenged church policies.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Latin American immigration--which is projected to boost the
American church's Latino population to 50% by the year 2050,
according to one national study--is reshaping the church yet again.
To complicate matters, the church is also experiencing a rising surge
of traditionalists who want to return to Latin liturgies and faithful
conformity to Vatican authority--as opposed to liberals who are
calling for women's ordination and other dramatic changes.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really understands what the laity is now, because the
spectrum is so broad," Henning of St. Paul the Apostle Church said.
But unified by the scandal, she said, "a lot of people seem to think
that the church will never go back to being the same again."</TE>

<HD>Copper Wildfire Nearly Doused</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fire crews came close Sunday to containing a fire that charred 23,500
acres near Santa Clarita, but they had more difficulty with a second
blaze near Ojai that has consumed nearly 21,000 acres of the Los
Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   And about 150 homes were evacuated Sunday in Mooney Flat, in
Northern California, as winds fanned a 1,000-acre wildfire closer to
the structures.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they expect to fully contain the fire in the
Green Valley in northern Los Angeles County by this evening. In five
days, the Copper fire destroyed nine houses and came perilously close
to dozens more. It was named after the street where a welder's sparks
set off the blaze Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "It had attitude," said U.S. Forest Service firefighter Aaron
Lawson, one of nearly 2,000 personnel called to the wildfire. "It
took off and burned like the best of them. We got ahead of it and put
it out."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the cost of battling the Copper fire had surpassed $3.7
million and was projected to reach $4.5 million. Eight firefighters
sustained minor injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Dry brush throughout the region will almost certainly fuel more
fires in the summer and fall.</TE>
<TE>   As fire engines pulled out of Green Valley, a neighborhood of dirt
roads, horse corrals and ranch homes, residents returned after
evacuating. On one street, neighbors were planning a "survival party"
to celebrate their good fortune. The hillside abutting their homes
was charred, but the flames stopped there.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than evacuate her house with all its mementos, Faith Burton
chose to watch it all.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was going to go," the actress said, "I wanted to see it go
myself and wish it well."</TE>
<TE>   Surveying the ashen hills in San Francisquito Canyon, Burton said,
"It's like a moonscape."</TE>
<TE>   Weary crews near Ojai battled the so-called Wolf fire for the
ninth day Sunday, allowing only a 55-acre growth in the blaze. But
the job is far from over, as containment remained at 40% for the
second day.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 2,000 firefighters from a dozen county, state and federal
agencies have attacked the blaze from land and air since it began
June 1.</TE>
<TE>   Forest service officials had anticipated major progress in
containing the wildfire after three straight days of milder
temperatures and marine-layer moisture, but that did not materialize
as of Sunday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we are building a line, we're not confident enough
about whether the line will hold to be able to say we're getting
extra containment," said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Crews have been able to keep the fire from burning over the north
side of the Pine Mountain ridge and from creeping south of Sespe
Creek, said Barry Peckham of the U.S. Forest Service. The threat to
structures would have been much greater had flames crossed those
barriers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yuba County fire started about 3 a.m. Sunday after high winds
knocked power lines into a tree, a spokeswoman for the California
Department of Forestry told the Associated Press. Winds pushed the
fire southeast in the direction of Mooney Flat, about 60 miles
northeast of Sacramento, where the evacuation of 150 homes was
ordered. The fire was 30% contained Sunday evening and no injuries
were reported, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last week, the fire charred 20,850 acres of thick,
extremely dry chaparral brush and pinyon pines. So far, it has cost
federal, state and county agencies $8.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the blaze is still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Several roads and recreation areas, including the entire Sespe
Wilderness, remain closed. California 33 is open, however, as is
Wheeler Gorge campground, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Scholar Urges Delay in City's Redistricting</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Entering the city's fractious debate over the redrawing of council
district lines, a USC law professor is advising Los Angeles officials
to delay implementation of the new boundaries, which would allow
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter to finish her term in her coastal
district.</LD>
<LD>   Erwin Chemerinsky said he believes the push to carry out any
changes immediately would compromise the democratic process.</LD>
<LD>   "Common practice throughout the country is that new election
districts are implemented as of the next election and the next term
of the legislative body," said Chemerinsky, who helped draft the
city's new charter.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a strong policy reason for this: It allows constituents
to be represented by the elected official that they chose.</TE>
<TE>   "Implementing new districts immediately undermines this important
value of democracy in that it means that some or many voters are no
longer represented by the council member that they elected."</TE>
<TE>   The council is set to vote Tuesday on a new map of the city's 15
council districts, redrawn to reflect population changes in Census
2000. Nearly all the districts show some revisions, but the most
drastic would be the elimination of Galanter's coastal district.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal calls for setting up a new district in the San
Fernando Valley by moving Galanter's 6th District, which now includes
parts of West Los Angeles, Venice and the Crenshaw district, to the
East Valley. In turn, Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski's district would
be extended to pick up much of Galanter's coastal area.</TE>
<TE>   Galanter is urging her colleagues to delay implementing the
changes until after she finishes her term next year, even though
Assistant City Atty. Anthony Alperin has warned lawmakers that they
would need a "sufficiently compelling" reason not to implement the
new districts immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to bolster her position, Galanter asked Chemerinsky to
study whether the council could legally delay the implementation
date.</TE>
<TE>   The law professor on Friday issued a letter on his findings.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no legal authority that requires that new council
districts be put into effect immediately," Chemerinsky wrote. "Nor is
there clear authority prohibiting this. After carefully researching
the issue, I believe that the better approach under the law is having
new districts go into effect for the next election of council members
and then for the terms beginning after that election."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to deciding whether to delay implementation of new
boundaries, the council must settle several turf battles over which
lawmakers will represent key parts of downtown and south Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Dunn Made for Post as Leader of Energy Probe</HD>
<DH>Profile: State senator, whose investigation of
price-gouging is striking pay dirt, has formidable legal skills.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The clout of the state Senate investigation into alleged
price-gouging by California electricity generators was evident Friday
when Sen. Joe Dunn took his seventh phone call in three days from H.
Ross Perot.</LD>
<LD>   The former presidential candidate and chairman of Perot Systems
Corp. first called Dunn's office Wednesday after the legislator made
public the company's 44-page PowerPoint presentation detailing how to
manipulate California's electricity market to control prices. Perot's
firm designed the market's computer systems.</LD>
<LD>   The Perot primer, which outlined "holes" in California's
electricity bidding process--allegedly for electricity producers in
the late 1990s--was delivered to Dunn's office buried in a shipment
of documents from Reliant Energy Co. Four weeks earlier, documents
obtained by Dunn's Senate Select Committee on Price Manipulation of
the Electricity Market revealed the catchy names Enron gave its
California trading strategies: Death Star, Get Shorty and Fat Boy.</LD>
<TE>   The revelations focused national attention on the Santa Ana
Democrat's quest, begun quietly 17 months ago, to delve into
allegations that manipulation of California's energy market led to
price spikes, and electricity shortages in the spring and summer of
2000, and finally rolling blackouts in December 2000. The committee's
findings will help determine whether California can recoup $9 billion
for alleged overcharges and change the terms on $42 billion in
contracts to buy future electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Dunn, 43, is perfectly poised for the task. Born and
raised in St. Paul, Minn., he was the youngest of five boys in a
family with three generations of laborers. He earned a law degree
from the University of Minnesota and went to work for a consumer
advocacy firm. In 1985, he moved to Orange County and went to work
for Robinson, Calcagnia &amp; Robinson, whose founding partner, Mark
Robinson, is a major Democratic donor and former president of the
Consumer Attorneys of California. Dunn represented Los Angeles County
in litigation against the tobacco industry. He also oversaw
plaintiffs suing over faulty breast implants, was the lead attorney
in a lawsuit over defective artificial-heart valves and coordinated
lawsuits against the makers of the diet drug fen-phen.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Dunn moved to central Orange County to challenge
then-state Sen. Rob Hurtt of Garden Grove, a major donor to
Republican and conservative causes whose district had edged into
Democratic territory. Dunn and his wife, Diane, and children--Sarah,
10, and John, 8--live in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's meticulous style, honed by years of complex trial work, was
evident even before his election: He and his campaign staff
hand-delivered mums--20,000 in all--to every female voter in the
district older than 60.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for my background, I don't think I would have been
able to do this," Dunn said of his committee's work, which involves
sifting through hundreds of thousands of pages of documents.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn and his committee spent months demanding that private energy
documents be turned over for public inspection, even citing Enron for
contempt on a unanimous, bipartisan vote. Last month, Enron's board
of directors waived the company's attorney-client privilege, the last
logjam to disclosure. The Enron "Death Star" memo arrived soon
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said no one
knew what would be uncovered by the Senate Select Committee on Price
Manipulation of the Electricity Market.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe's ... very thorough and he's been building the facts," Burton
said. "He's very tenacious."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Bill Morrow, the ranking Republican on the seven-member
select committee, said he and Dunn are polar opposites on issues such
as tort reform, but share a common goal for the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the plaintiff's attorneys' golden child," said Morrow of San
Juan Capistrano. "He's the poster boy for their agenda. I'm on the
opposite side of that coin. We butt heads all the time. Having said
that, while we disagree on so many of these issues, we can walk away
and go have a beer together."</TE>
<TE>   Morrow and Dunn agreed not to let partisanship undermine the
committee work or grandstand its findings. "There are much higher
interests at stake," Morrow said. "Neither one of us has been
unmindful of the political sensitivities we face. But whatever
breaks, breaks--no matter who it might be embarrassing to."</TE>
<TE>   He joined another GOP conservative, Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks), to halt a program that required drivers to pay
additional fees for registering vehicles, then wait for a rebate by
mail.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Dunn's freshman year, he was dubbed the Senate's Ralph
Nader for investigating Caltrans over faulty work on bridges in the
three-freeway Orange Crush interchange in Santa Ana and Orange, and
for oversized trucks being misrouted and hitting bridges too low for
clearance.</TE>
<TE>   The energy pricing investigation will continue past the
Legislature's Sept. 1 adjournment and into next year, Dunn said.
He'll take time out to campaign for reelection in November, when he
faces Republican Araceli Gonzales, a former member of the Cudahy City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to get to the truth of this and we're going to make
the truth known," he said.</TE>

<TE>   In Orange County, Dunn pushed for state legislation by Assemblyman
Lou Correa (D-Santa Ana), signed by Gov. Gray Davis last year, that
forced the city of Tustin to turn over land at the closed Tustin
Marine base to two Santa Ana school districts. The bill at one point
died after Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) filibustered to keep it from
a vote; the act so flustered Dunn that he responded with a tearful
plea on behalf of Santa Ana schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation into California's energy crisis will continue
past the Legislature's Sept. 1 adjournment and into next year, Dunn
said. He'll take time out to campaign for reelection in November,

<HD>Johnny Kimberley, 78; British Earl Known for Glorious
Failures</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Kimberley, the fourth Earl of Kimberley, 78, a glorious
failure in a variety of private and public endeavors including the
posts of Liberal spokesman in the British House of Lords and chairman
of Britain's National Council on Alcoholism, has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Kimberley died May 12 of renal failure in Wiltshire, England.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, Lord Kimberley had sold real estate in Jamaica,
operated his London public relations firm and served as a Guards
Armored Division officer in World War II. He also had been a member
of Britain's national bobsled team, a championship tiddlywinks
player, a breeder of prize pigs, and an amateur steeplechase jockey
and shark fisherman.</LD>
<TE>   But he may be best remembered for his lack of luck in marriage.
Married six times (and divorced five), he held the unenviable record
as the most married man in the British peerage.</TE>
<TE>   He reportedly was even more unlucky in gambling than in marriage,
being forced to sell his family's immense properties over the years
to pay his debts.</TE>
<TE>   His career in the House of Lords began its downward turn when he
was fired as a Liberal Party spokesman in 1979 when he called upon
the public to vote for the Conservative Party in the coming general
election. However, he continued to serve on the Lords' All Party
Defense Study Group and was that body's president from 1992 to 1999.
He had been a delegate to the North Atlantic Assembly from 1981 to
1993.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Kimberley considered himself an authority on defense, foreign
policy, aviation and UFOs. A member of the Lords' All Party UFO Study
Group, he once gave such a rousingly singular speech on UFOs in the
Lords that the official record of the speech was sold out within 24
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Kimberley failed to win election to the newly organized House
of Lords in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some years earlier, he was fired from the chairmanship of the
National Council on Alcoholism by the British health minister after
publicly maintaining that alcoholics need not abstain from drink.
Lord Kimberley explained that although he was an alcoholic, he
continued to drink a bottle of white wine a day and was none the
worse for it.</TE>
<TE>   He contrasted his present state of health to that of his "insane"
years of drinking, explaining that by "insane" he meant "no normal
person would try to drive a car up the steps of the Grand Hotel in
Brighton," as he had once done.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Kimberley's father had been a World War I hero and former
member of the House of Commons. His godfather was the statesman
Winston Churchill and a cousin was the humorist P.G. Wodehouse.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Eton, Lord Kimberley briefly attended Cambridge
University's Magdalene College. His education ended, according to
London's Daily Telegraph, when he got drunk during a night on the
town and "accidentally enlisted in the Grenadier Guards."</TE>
<TE>   He landed in Normandy shortly after D-day and fought his way
across Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, he embarked on the first of his disastrous marriages when
he wed a daughter of the master of the King's Household. The marriage
took place in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The queen and
the two princesses attended the ceremony, and King George VI toasted
the bride and groom.</TE>
<TE>   His divorces, as well as gambling debts and high living, led to
the liquidation of his inherited wealth.</TE>
<TE>   He made some money back in the 1950s with his PR firm, whose
clients included Gregory Peck and Elizabeth Taylor, and later with
his real estate sales operation in Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   Lord Kimberley had used a wheelchair since suffering a stroke in
the 1990s. Last year, he published a racingly readable volume of
memoirs, "The Whim of the Wheel."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his sixth wife, the former Janey Consett, and
four sons.</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Looks at Jails as Key to New Funds</HD>
<DH>County: Panel report suggests selling land near detention
facilities and renting unused cells to other counties as two methods
to raise money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County should consider consolidating some of its facilities
to save money, selling excess land at its jails and renting unused
jail beds to other counties, according to a new grand jury report.</LD>
<LD>   With more than $1 billion worth of land, title to 136 buildings
and about $6 million in annual rent payments, the county should
develop a coordinated strategy for managing its real estate, the
citizens panel suggested.</LD>
<LD>   On any given day, three of 10 jail beds are unfilled. Even with a
Sheriff's Department forecast of maximum jail needs through 2015, the
report found more than 100 beds would remain empty daily.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff Bob Brooks said his department already collects $1.65
million a year from the state and federal governments by renting
empty cells to temporarily house their prisoners who have been
arrested in this county. Reimbursement for people subject to
deportation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service brings in
an additional $1.7 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks said he has approached other counties about handling jail
overflow, but their limited budgets prevent expanding the practice.
''They'd be happy to give us inmates, but they don't want to pay,''
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury report focused on the land surrounding the Todd
Road Jail, near Santa Paula, and the Ojai Women's Facility, saying
that only a small portion of the 141 acres in Ojai are needed to
accommodate an average of 156 prisoners a day there.</TE>
<TE>   Adjacent to the 20-acre Todd Road Jail complex is a 137-acre,
county-owned lemon orchard expected to generate about $300,000 for
the county's general fund this year. The report suggests assessing
whether this land should be sold or developed.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks cautioned that the Ojai land may not be very desirable
because it lies near an earthquake fault in a flood plain and its
soil is contaminated with nitrates from an inmate-run pig farm that
was discontinued several years ago. Also, zoning issues and concerns
about safety would make developing either site difficult, the sheriff
added.</TE>
<TE>   ''There's the reality that you can't put anything that close to a
jail,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury said the county owns approximately 11,000 acres in
about 900 separate parcels.</TE>
<TE>   County properties include thousands of acres that always will
remain in public use, such as Channel Islands Harbor, Camarillo
Airport, Ventura County Government Center, 3,700-acre Happy Camp
Canyon Regional Park near Moorpark, golf courses and other
recreational facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The General Services Agency staff oversees about 2.6 million
square feet of space used by the county in 154 buildings, of which 18
are leased. The county leases extra space in about 70 other
buildings. In all, the county spends about $500,000 a month to lease
480,000 square feet, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Most of that space is leased on behalf of the Human Services
Agency and the Health Care agency, which operate welfare offices and
health clinics throughout the county along with the Ventura County
Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to have locations spread out around the county, so they
can be where their clients and patients are," said Sean Payne, the
GSA's manager of real property services. "Consolidating doesn't
necessarily work."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston is expected
Tuesday to recommend that the Board of Supervisors adopt a policy
calling for an inventory of the county's capital assets and having a
committee of senior department heads assess the continued need for
these assets--ideas also suggested in the grand jury report.</TE>

<HD>Slaying at Gay Bar Probed as Hate Crime</HD>
<DH>Riverside: Police are looking for a group of apparent
skinheads who yelled slurs before the attack. A second man was hurt.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An attack outside a popular gay bar in downtown Riverside that left
one man dead and another man wounded has been labeled a hate crime by
police.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities said they are still looking for a group of apparent
skinheads who instigated the melee by yelling homosexual slurs at the
victims before stabbing them.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a hate crime, absolutely," Riverside Police Chief Russell
Leach said of Thursday's attack outside the Menagerie nightclub.
"Here we are in 2002 and still such a long way off from acceptance."</LD>
<TE>   Moreno Valley resident Jeffery Owens, 40, died of multiple stab
wounds to the back. At the time of the attack, Owens was trying to
come to the aid of friend Michael Bussee, 48, who had been slugged in
the face and stabbed as he chatted with friends in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "You want some trouble ... fag, here it is," the attacker yelled
at Owens before jabbing a knife into him, police said.</TE>
<TE>   No arrests have been made. Police are looking for four to six men
with shaved heads.</TE>
<TE>   Shocked by the attack and grieving for the loss of Owens, a
regular who until recently worked for an AIDS education program,
friends have continued to gather at the bar each night hoping to keep
their own hate in check.</TE>
<TE>   "Mostly people are just angry," said David St. Pierre, owner of
the Menagerie. "People just want to do something, but they don't know
what to do."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, St. Pierre tried to fill that void with a vigil
for Owens in the bar's parking lot, where friends and strangers have
left a growing mound of cards, candles and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside's mayor and the police chief were scheduled to attend,
to pay their respects to Owens and show their support for the town's
gay community.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of this is a peace rally, to have the community come
together," Leach said. "And we want to be there to ensure the
community their law enforcement is serious about prosecuting crimes
motivated by hate."</TE>
<TE>   Police said the attack on Owens and Bussee seemed to come out of
the blue.</TE>
<TE>   Both men, who had come to the bar to celebrate a friend's
birthday, left with their partners about midnight Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Owens, an avid photographer, had a stack of photos from a recent
trip to Joshua Tree National Park in his van and invited everyone
over to take a look.</TE>
<TE>   As he retrieved the pictures, a man standing with a group of
people in the parking lot approached Bussee and punched him before
stabbing him in the back, the bar owner said.</TE>
<TE>   As Bussee slouched into his friend's van, Owens demanded to know
what was happening and was then stabbed about four times in the back,
although he didn't realize it at the time, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither man knew how badly he was hurt, and they began to drive
toward Moreno Valley. Soon, Owens told his friends he had pain in his
back and thought maybe he had broken a rib.</TE>
<TE>   They decided to stop at the county hospital in Moreno Valley. It
was only as he stepped out of the van that friends saw his seat
soaked in blood.</TE>
<TE>   After two operations, Owens died about 8:30 a.m. Thursday, police
said. Bussee, a marriage and family therapist, was released after
being treated for the wound to his back.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the area surrounding the Menagerie, sandwiched between
a couple of straight bars and a coffeehouse, is usually trouble-free.</TE>
<TE>   Problems have occasionally erupted on Wednesdays, however, at the
nearby city-sponsored Market Night, a collection of food and craft
booths downtown. Fights and loitering by gangs and teens had forced
city officials to halt Market Night for a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the attack, St. Pierre said he considers Riverside to be a
tolerant community. It's only every now and then that patrons at
surrounding bars or shops may shout a slur as customers hustle in and
out of the Menagerie, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everybody is completely accepting," St. Pierre said. "But
then again, this bar has been here 20 years, and we've never had an
incident to this extreme. And the local government is completely
supportive of the gay and lesbian community."</TE>
<TE>   St. Pierre said his business has not been affected by the slaying.
He had a full house over the weekend. Even Bussee dropped in to see
his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like terrorism," St. Pierre said. "If you stop doing what
you normally do, then they've won."</TE>

<HD>Latinos Spread Their News on the Web</HD>
<DH>Culture: Feeling ignored by mainstream media, young
journalists turn to the Internet. It's a forum to discuss 'who we
are,' one writer says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Latino twentysomethings in Orange County is putting such
tantalizing headlines on the Internet as "Blood and Oranges,"
"Putting a Brown Face on Orange County" and "Beer Bottles, Blood
Money, and Other Cinco de Mayo Party Favors." These are titles of
articles posted on a Web site, www.oclatino.net, one of several
recently launched news sites aimed at Latinos in Orange County. Its
young founders, graduates of local colleges who participated in
Latino student groups, said they hope it will be an alternative forum
for people, like themselves, who feel ignored by mainstream media.</LD>
<LD>   It is just one example of ethnically oriented "zines" popping up
on the Internet, where it is easy to reach a potentially large
audience, even without advertisers.</LD>
<LD>   Started in March, the Orange County Latino site has received 4,000
hits without any publicity, said founder Pablo Serrato of Placentia,
who attends UC Berkeley. The site resembles latinola.com, which
concentrates on Latino happenings in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County activist Zeke Hernandez is sending out a Web
newsletter he calls "Apples and Oranges con pico de gallo," a
reference to the spice used on fruit sold on street corners in Mexico
and in U.S. Latino enclaves. Like the spice, he hopes the information
will pique people's interest.</TE>
<TE>   Another Internet entry is www.rocketeria.com, a Santa Ana-based
Web site that reports on Latin concerts in Orange County and
elsewhere. The site was started three years ago but recently was
taken down for an overhaul. It is expected back online in a matter of
days, organizers said.</TE>
<TE>   These Internet venues show how English-dominant, educated Latinos
are trying to express themselves in an increasingly diverse county of
more than 2.8 million people that is struggling to differentiate
itself from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help Latinos forge their own identity and declare
their independence from Los Angeles," said Gustavo Arrellano, a
23-year-old Chapman University graduate who writes for oclatino.net.</TE>
<TE>   Another oclatino.net writer, 24-year-old Adriana Alva Sanchez,
added: "We are at a pivotal point in California history. Latinos ...
are becoming a larger and larger part of the population in Orange
County, and there's no forum to discuss who we are."</TE>
<TE>   The appearance of these Web projects interests media watchers such
as Jeffrey H. Brody, associate professor of communications at Cal
State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Brody said Latinos and other minorities have lost representation
as the number of mainstream media outlets have decreased.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has lost five daily newspapers since 1984, Brody
said. The county's population has grown to the size of some Latin
American countries. At the same time, the number of Latinos has grown
to 30.8% of Orange County's population, according to the 2000 census,
up 55% from 1990.</TE>
<TE>   To fill the gap, Serrato called in four fellow Chapman University
grads to help him launch a Latino news outlet. The group meets twice
a month. It accepts articles from friends and others if the material
is considered relevant to Orange County Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Group members volunteer their time but would like to find
advertisers or sponsorship, provided it wouldn't squelch the voice of
the writers, Serrato said.</TE>
<TE>   The "Apples and Oranges con pico de gallo" newsletter began about
two years ago, when Hernandez decided someone had to publicize
community events not listed elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, president of the local chapter of the League of United
Latin American Citizens, e-mails the newsletter of short items about
issues in one community that he believes might inspire activism in
another.</TE>
<TE>   About 750 people are on his e-mail list, but anyone who wants to
receive the newsletter can request it from Hernandez at
zekeher@juno.com.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't expect a lot of information in mainstream media,"
Hernandez said. "Mainstream media may see what I have and then they
may pick it up. And that's important too."</TE>
<TE>   The newsletter comes out mostly on Fridays, but Hernandez said he
does not maintain a strict schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Cesar Arrendondo, editor and writer for rocketeria.com, said the
Web site also reflects the lack of media outlets and businesses that
address young Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our peculiar tastes," Arrendondo said of his readers. "We
are Americans with connections to the cultures of our countries.
Marketing does not know how to address us. The infrastructure is not
there."</TE>
<TE>   rocketeria.com was created to cover alternative international
Latino rock, but because the Web site is in Santa Ana, local events
also are featured, including concerts at Latin music hotspot JC
Fandango in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Among the writers and photographers are students from UC Irvine,
Santa Ana College and Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   oclatino.net's Serrato said many young Latinos are thrilled to
have a place where they can contribute because they are intimidated
by mainstream media.</TE>
<TE>   The oclatino.net site changes content monthly. May's edition
includes commentary about the commercialism of Cinco de Mayo, a
feature about a new organization for those with Indian ancestry and
information about laws cracking down on Santa Ana street vendors.</TE>
<TE>   A piece in the April issue, "Putting a Brown Face on Orange
County," talked about the barrios orange pickers call home.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a community service," said Serrato. "We're challenging
the idea of being a monolithic race, or the orthodoxy of being
Latinos. Latinos in Orange County have many identities and we hope we
can demonstrate them."</TE>

<HD>UFW Member Total Is Questioned</HD>
<DH>Labor: The union says its accuser is basing the accusation
on incorrect set of numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reigniting a debate over the clout of the United Farm Workers union,
a farm industry attorney is accusing the UFW of overstating its
membership in an effort to bolster the union's reputation and help
win converts in the fields.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural
Assn., has long accused the union of inflating its numbers, but he
now believes he has proof in the form of an amended federal document
in which the UFW lowers its membership estimates by nearly 80%.</LD>
<LD>   From 1995 to 1999, the UFW claimed membership of 26,000 on reports
filed annually with the U.S. Department of Labor. The union upped
that figure to 27,000 in 2000. But last month, in response to an
inquiry by the Labor Department, the union revised its membership to
5,945, according to the amended report.</LD>
<TE>   "Here they are portraying themselves as the voice of California
farm workers, and yet they represent less than 1%," said Roy, who
fired off a letter in February prompting the Labor Department probe.</TE>
<TE>   However, union officials say the lower number represents only
those laborers working under UFW contract at the end of the year, and
not the total number of members who work under contract on a seasonal
basis at least one day during the year.</TE>
<TE>   UFW President Arturo Rodriguez said labor officials directed the
union to use the year-end number, although they were told it
reflected only a fraction of those on the union's membership rolls. A
Labor Department official in Los Angeles confirmed that the UFW, like
all labor organizations, was instructed to report only those members
working at year's end and acknowledged that seasonal employment could
cause that number to fluctuate.</TE>
<TE>   For the UFW, Rodriguez said the year-end number is particularly
misleading because it only counts union members working under
contract on Dec. 31, a traditionally slow time in agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Roy's contention that the amended number is close to
accurate, Rodriguez maintains that the number of rank-and-file,
dues-paying members stands at 27,000, a total boosted in recent years
by an organizing drive that has put thousands of laborers--from
Washington state to Florida--to work under the UFW's banner.</TE>
<TE>   "The union is anything but dying at this point," said Rodriguez,
who became UFW president after the death of founder Cesar Chavez in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   Growers for years have challenged the validity of the UFW's
membership claims, a spinoff of the bitter and often brutal battles
that have marked the union's struggle for better wages and working
conditions for America's poorest working class.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the union's strength and influence in the fields have
waned over the years, yet UFW officials continue to lean on Chavez's
legacy, often as a way of drawing donations from independent
benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   Union dues totaled $1.8 million in 2000. Citizen contributions
totaled nearly twice that.</TE>
<TE>   UFW leaders say the union has made great strides since 1994, when
Rodriguez, as new UFW president, pledged to rebuild the struggling
organization by returning to field organizing.</TE>
<TE>   Once a formidable national presence, with upward of 80,000 members
at its peak in 1973, the union had suffered decades of declining
membership and was barely at 20,000 members when Chavez died 20 years
later.</TE>
<TE>   Since that time, UFW leaders say the union has won 21 elections,
including votes at the Chateau St. Michelle Winery in Washington and
at Quincy Farms in Florida, that state's top producer of fresh
mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The union also has picked up its organizing work across
California, producing historic victories at Gallo of Sonoma and at
Coastal Berry Co. in Oxnard, where more than 750 pickers are covered
by a landmark contract that gives the UFW its first major stake in
the state's tough-to-organize strawberry industry.</TE>

<HD>County, Child Activists Wage Court Battles</HD>
<DH>Services: Legal fees rise as the combatants grapple over
issues involving field trip volunteers, shelter access and health
reporting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A series of court battles between children's advocates and Los
Angeles County is running up legal fees and causing some of the
advocates to complain that the county is protecting its legal rights
at the expense of children's welfare.</LD>
<LD>   In one case, county lawyers are resisting efforts to allow
volunteers to take abused and neglected children on short field trips
from the county's MacLaren Children's Center. In another, they argued
unsuccessfully that the county should not be punished when social
workers fail to report when a foster child is hospitalized, injured
or moved.</LD>
<LD>   And in a third, government officials initially said children's
advocates should not be allowed to visit the county shelter or see
its blueprints--an argument they later reconsidered, allowing the
visits. The county said that its efforts are meant to defend
children, protecting them, for instance, from volunteers who might
harm them while on the short excursions from MacLaren.</LD>
<TE>   In court papers, county lawyers laid out a list of requirements
that they said the judge should make of volunteer advocates, who act
as guardians for foster children in difficult cases, before renewing
a roughly 7-year-old blanket order allowing the trips.</TE>
<TE>   The most contested point is a county requirement that volunteers
who have been convicted of anything other than minor traffic
violations must get a waiver from the state before they can be left
alone with children.</TE>
<TE>   County officials said the added scrutiny became necessary after
another group of child advocates won a legal battle requiring the
shelter to meet the same standards as other group homes.</TE>
<TE>   But Sharzad Talieh, director of the Court-Appointed Special
Advocate program, complained that those rules apply only to employees
of the group homes, not the advocates, who work for the court. No
other county group home has set up those barriers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The 25-year-old court program makes extensive criminal background
checks on its volunteers, she said, and has its own policy for
waiving minor or irrelevant past transgressions.</TE>
<TE>   She claimed that the county's real motivation is to restrict
access to MacLaren, long the subject of complaints of abuse and
overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a control issue," Talieh said. "The big story is: Why is the
county counsel--who's supposed to be representing the interest of the
public--being paid our taxpayer dollars to fight what's good for
children?"</TE>
<TE>   Presiding Juvenile Judge Michael Nash will hold a hearing on the
issue this week.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Bock, head of the county's child welfare department, said
that each case was an individual, reasonable objection and that
advocates are reading too much into them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a fight. It's a legal process. That's how disputes get
resolved," she said. "This is quintessentially what makes America so
great. You go in and make your argument and the judge rules."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant County Counsel Ada Gardiner, one of three high-ranking
officials who supervise the dozens of attorneys who represent the
county Department of Children and Family Services, said her office
helps child advocates when it can, but also is determined to protect
the county's legal interests.</TE>
<TE>   "We, as lawyers for the county, have to represent the county and
take their position in court. That's our job," she said. "If funds
were limitless, maybe things would be different."</TE>
<TE>   The head of the Juvenile Court said he thinks that the county is
reasonably defending its legal rights on complex issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I have from Day 1 around here encouraged the use of the legal
system to resolve disputes," said Nash. "I can't say that they didn't
have an arguable position in anything that I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   But some advocates said the county simply fights too much, too
long.</TE>
<TE>   They cited its protracted efforts to keep the courts from meddling
with social workers' policies of deciding how often to visit foster
children.</TE>
<TE>   State law requires monthly visits, but allows a waiver if the case
meets specific standards that show that the child is in a safe,
stable home and has been doing well for some time.</TE>
<TE>   A number of reports over the years criticized Los Angeles County's
internal visitation waiver process as overused and dangerous. Two
years ago, the county could not say how many children were on
waivers, and judges and lawyers complained that it rarely informed
the court when it decided to reduce visits to children.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the nonprofit Alliance for Children's Rights asked
the court to force reforms, leading to an order by then-Presiding
Juvenile Court Judge Terry Friedman that judges hold hearings in each
case in which a social worker says fewer visits are appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   Despite having stated publicly that more visits would be
beneficial to children, the county fought the advocates' request to
Friedman and then appealed the case up to the state Supreme Court,
losing at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   The issue, the county argued, was whether a judge can set social
worker policy--especially when that policy costs the county money by
requiring more staff.</TE>
<TE>   After its last loss, the county said it is preparing to comply
with the order, but its lawyers are seeking a modification to make
the hearings optional rather than mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   "I do see a trend of spending Los Angeles County money litigating
issues that are not in the best interest of the children," said Amy
Pellman, head of the Alliance for Children's Rights, the nonprofit
group that won the visitation reforms.</TE>
<TE>   "The irony is: If they took the money they spent litigating this
case to hire more social workers, then their whole argument that it
was a budget issue would be moot," Pellman said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, one of two supervisors who objected to
appealing the child visitation order, said that he has seen the
department put up legal roadblocks to reforms, and that the
department is resisting his attempts to ask questions.</TE>
<TE>   "A kind of disease of bureaucratic defensiveness has set in where
every single inquiry becomes a cause celebre--becomes, to quote [Los
Angeles Mayor] Jim Hahn, an issue of biblical proportions," said
Yaroslavsky. "To me, it's unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Others on the board disagreed. Supervisor Gloria Molina defended
the county's decision to fight the visitation order.</TE>
<TE>   She agreed with the advocates that not enough children were being
visited, but she did not think that the court should be involved in
every waiver, her staff said.</TE>
<TE>   "The way they wanted it done was inappropriate, in our opinion,"
said Molina spokesman Miguel Santana.</TE>
<TE>   But he said such disputes are not uncommon because of the nature
of the relationship between the government and advocacy groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Oftentimes, the county and advocates have the same goal in mind,"
he said. "The problem becomes: How do you get there? There's always
going to be points of contention."</TE>

<HD>Irvine 'Sub-City' Plan Attacked</HD>
<DH>Land use: Neighbors feel broadsided by housing development
that would wipe out farmland. Officials, who will vote Tuesday, say
plan matches city goals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA and EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's pitched as the glorious final chapter for one of America's most
manicured communities, one that will fill other cities with envy.</LD>
<LD>   The blueprints approved unanimously by the Irvine City Council
last week call for squeezing a sub-city of 35,000 residents--about a
fourth of the city's current population and roughly the size of San
Juan Capistrano--into one of the busiest sections of Southern
California, near the high-rise corporate campuses of Irvine Spectrum.</LD>
<LD>   But the plan, which goes before the council for its second reading
and vote Tuesday, has run into objections from city residents and
environmentalists. They complain that the city will lose too much of
its agricultural heritage in this buildup, and that there is no room
for another chapter of mega-growth in their model city.</LD>
<TE>   The "villages" that would make up the Irvine Co.'s so-called
Northern Sphere would be packed into about five square miles wrapped
around the former El Toro Marine base. County voters recently killed
a plan for a major international airport on the land.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   250,000 Trips Per Day</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are staggering. Cars would be making as many as
250,000 trips every day on already-clogged freeways and surface
streets, tens of thousands of trips more than an airport would bring.</TE>
<TE>   About six square miles of parks and preserves would be set aside
as part of the deal. But much of the city's remaining farmland--about
four square miles that include citrus groves, row crops and the
450-acre Hines Horticulture Inc. nursery--would be wiped out. It's
all too much for some residents, who see the project as epitomizing
the urban ills they moved to Irvine to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Some decry the "Los Angelization" of the orderly city, noting that
the conveniences they sought in Irvine are rapidly disappearing.
Once-clear intersections are jammed. Long lines at businesses and
public offices are a routine inconvenience.</TE>
<TE>   Now this.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors feel broadsided. They complain that approval was moving
forward for this massive development while their attention was
focused on fighting the airport. What especially irks many who live
nearby is that the Irvine Co. is using thousands of development
"credits" it gained by not building homes approved in other, often
wealthier, parts of town. Those credits are now being cashed in the
northern part of the city.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Caught in Shell Game'</TE>
<TE>   "We're caught in a shell game," said Richard Deskin, a 22-year
resident of Irvine who sat on a citizens advisory panel to the
project. "They're taking 8,000 homes that were supposed to go in
other places and dumping them here."</TE>
<TE>   City and company officials say the banking of units is consistent
with long-range goals drafted years ago. They offer charts showing
the Northern Sphere will be no more dense than other neighborhoods in
town.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doing something that's greatly different than in other
areas," said Anthony Dragun, chairman of the city's Planning
Commission.</TE>
<TE>   He and others say the project will generate jobs and sorely needed
housing, preserve an impressive swath of open space and bring in $5.7
million in annual sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   As for the farmland, city officials say there is no sense in
saving the bulk of the 3,100 acres that will be used by the project.
Large-scale agriculture operations are not the highest and best use
for land in the middle of an urban environment--especially when the
land can be used to ease the county's housing shortage.</TE>
<TE>   About 1,700 agriculture jobs would be lost. They would be replaced
by about 17,660 jobs inside office buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a rapidly eroding supply of land for agriculture in
Orange County as you see all the development going in around the
county," said Don Dressler, president of Western Growers Assn.'s
insurance services division. "Also, we have some unique soil and
climate conditions, particularly in the Irvine area, that are hard to
produce in other areas. Tomatoes, peppers, green beans--they're all
crops that can't be produced elsewhere in the same amount of time
that they are here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City Rebuked in Past</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether courts will uphold the argument that
farmland isn't worth saving.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Irvine made that case, the city was sued by
environmentalists, then rebuked by the state Superior Court. That
conflict involved 600 acres of strawberry and bean fields on which
the company planned to build offices as part of an expansion of the
Irvine Spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Judge William McDonald's ruling in January noted that the city's
general plan had a stated goal of agriculture preservation, yet the
proposed Irvine Spectrum expansion involved agricultural land being
destroyed with little effort to mitigate the loss.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald wrote that it was unacceptable for the city to write off
alternatives that would preserve farmland because the Irvine Co.
wouldn't accept them.</TE>
<TE>   "The desires of the Irvine Co. do not govern the [California
Environmental Quality Act] requirements for the project," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to avoid such a setback again, the Irvine Co. has agreed to
donate 300 acres of farmland to be preserved under a city heritage
program. Officials from Defend the Bay, the Newport Beach nonprofit
group that filed the last challenge, call that a token offer.</TE>
<TE>   "This project has all the same problems as the other one," said
Robert Caustin, director of the group. "Rather than preserving the
history and heritage of the area, they are saying it is not feasible
because the land is worth $2 million an acre."</TE>
<TE>   Caustin would not say whether his group intends to file another
lawsuit, but he and other opponents note the city is moving ahead
with a massive project that will surround the El Toro base while the
future of the 4,700-acre property remains in question.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine is promising to turn the base into a park, but the U.S.
Navy is threatening to sell it to the highest bidder, which would
probably be a developer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plan Considered a Ploy</TE>
<TE>   Some residents say they originally considered Northern Sphere
planning a ploy to zone as many houses and offices within the
federally mandated safety zone under the El Toro flight path in an
effort to block the airport. After the airport was defeated in March,
they figured the city would scale back the project. Instead, it
steamed to approval.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a project that will generate more trips and more
pollution than an airport," Irvine resident Chuck DeVore said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Bollens, chairman of Urban and Regional Planning at UC
Irvine, said the approval comes as no surprise to him because the
city long ago declared how many houses it intended to ultimately
approve.</TE>
<TE>   The sticking point for him is low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   He wants the Irvine Co. to make good on a promise to build 1,800
low-income units, including at least 600 homes for families of four
with an annual income of less than $37,800.</TE>
<TE>   The company has balked at committing to that in writing but has
assured the city it intends to build the income-restricted units.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank J. Taglienti, 73, a candy salesman who introduced Americans to
the gummi bear, died June 4 of lung cancer in a Baltimore hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Gummi bears were created in 1922 by a German candy maker. By the
start of World War II, the candy maker's company, Haribo, was
cranking out 22,000 pounds of gummi bears a day.</LD>
<LD>   With a texture described as a cross between month-old Jello-O and
rubber bands, gummi bears are staples at discount stores and
supermarkets across the country.</LD>
<TE>   But the candy was little known before Taglienti started selling it
out of Haribo's Baltimore office in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1985, People magazine reported that Americans were chewing
more than 465,000 gummi bears a week.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Newark, N.J., Taglienti, graduated from Seton Hall
University with a degree in business administration and began his
career at Nestle Foods. Before joining Haribo, he peddled some of the
most recognizable names in American candy, including Nestle's Crunch,
Bit-O-Honey, Raisinets and Goobers.</TE>
<TE>   After two years as Haribo's chief salesman, he was appointed the
firm's U.S. president, a post he kept until his retirement in 1997.</TE>

<LD>As one of the San Fernando Valley's top political consultants, James
Acevedo played a key role in changing the political landscape of the
Valley, helping to elect state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar),
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City) and Los Angeles City
Council President Alex Padilla, all three of whom have achieved
"firsts" in California Latino politics.</LD>
<LD>   But since then, Acevedo and Alarcon have had a falling out, and
Cardenas has lost a costly election campaign to join Padilla on the
City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Acevedo said last week that he has decided to get out of the paid
political tactician business and focus his efforts on building
shopping centers and other projects.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm tired," Acevedo said. "I just turned 50. This is like the
third part of my life, because I was a hospital administrator before
[political consultant]. I want to make a living for my family now."</TE>
<TE>   Acevedo still hopes to play a role as unpaid advisor when one of
his allies needs help, but he has opened a downtown office for his
firm, Grapevine Development, and spends most of his time there now.</TE>
<TE>   "I will miss it," he said of the political work. "I set out on a
task of trying to get people in our community to step up and run, and
they did it at a time when there weren't a lot of people from our
community in office. Now we have Latinos running against Latinos. I'm
really happy about that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Net Gain Either Way</TE>
<TE>   The bets are down between California Gov. Gray Davis and New
Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey over who will win the NBA championship.</TE>
<TE>   If the Los Angeles Lakers win the best-of-seven series, McGreevey
has offered Davis a weekend on the Jersey shore and a bushel of corn
and tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   If the New Jersey Nets prevail, Davis will provide his East Coast
counterpart a case of Robert Mondavi wine, some California
artichokes, avocados, strawberries, a CD of the song "I Love L.A."
and two tickets to Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   In a satellite hookup between the two govs, Davis said the Lakers'
recent Western Conference finals victory over the formidable
Sacramento Kings "proved ... that they played with heart and showed
people why they are the reigning NBA champions."</TE>
<TE>   The California Republican Party couldn't resist jumping in with
its own partisan suggestion on what Davis should have offered to send
to New Jersey, including "$95 million worth of useless Oracle
software," "$40 billion of lousy energy contracts" and "$24 billion
in general fund debt."</TE>
<TE>   The odds are good that Davis did not think the GOP suggestions
were funny.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Compromising Positions</TE>
<TE>   How much fund-raising does a lobbyist have to do for an elected
city official before the public sees the official as compromised?</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles--where an elaborate campaign finance system,
complete with tight contribution limits and public financing for
those that obey them--that's the question at the center of a dispute
between the city's ethics czar and the City Council's top advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The city Ethics Commission recommended that City Council members
be required to recuse themselves from any action involving a lobbyist
who has made or delivered $1,000 in contributions to the elected
official in the previous 12 months. The elected official also would
have to avoid acting when a lobbyist conducts fund-raising for the
official.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton, the council's top advisor,
calls the new rules "overly restrictive."</TE>
<TE>   Deaton has suggested that the council require elected officials to
recuse themselves only if a lobbyist has made or delivered
contributions of more than $7,000 to the official, or if a lobbyist
conducts fund-raising that brings in $15,000 for a council member and
$25,000 for the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   LeeAnn Pelham, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said
setting the threshold at $15,000 does not make sense when the city
limits individual contributions in council races to $500.</TE>
<TE>   "That seems ridiculous," Pelham said of Deaton's proposal. "It
seems far too high when you consider the average contribution in a
city election is $250."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dumping on Dianne</TE>
<TE>   There are a few things politicians probably want to avoid in life,
and apparently challenging the water held by folks in the Imperial
Valley, who occupy California's arid southeast corner, is one of
them.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Sen. Dianne Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   She suggested in a letter that the Imperial Irrigation District
take some land out of agricultural production to bank water for San
Diego County or risk losing water rights without compensation.</TE>
<TE>   That drew a nasty comment from district director Bruce Kuhn, made
during an interview with the Imperial Valley Press.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government may make a grab for the water but they're
not going to do it without getting [sued]," Kuhn said. "I would
expect nothing less from Feinstein, being the bureaucratic gasbag,
pig-eyed sack of crap that she is. They will not take the water
without a long protracted legal battle."</TE>
<TE>   Is that any way to talk about California's senior senator and a
rumored presidential candidate?</TE>
<TE>   Kuhn later wrote a letter to the paper apologizing for his choice
of words but not the sentiment behind them.</TE>

<TE>   High-Anxiety Policy</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County supervisors entered unfamiliar territory last week
as they debated guidelines on the use of medicinal marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials suggested a policy that allows medicinal
users to possess six plants or one pound of dried pot. But
supervisors weren't sure if that was too little or not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Does one plant give us a pound--or does it give us an ounce?
That's what we need to know," said Supervisor Steve Bennett of
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors decided to get more information from the county's
public health officer, a farm advisor and the people who best know a
thing or two about growing weed--the medicinal users.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Schwarz, who has a doctor's prescription to smoke marijuana
for chronic pain, thanked the board for including people like her.
Schwarz contends six plants is not enough for the average patient.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult and tedious to grow," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Kathy Long said a policy is long past due. Proposition
215, which legalized marijuana for medicinal use, was approved by
state voters in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "As difficult as it is for those who voted no, it is now the law,"
the Camarillo supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, You're No Hahn</TE>
<TE>   Former Santa Clarita Mayor Carl Boyer recently offered an
unflattering comparison between current Los Angeles Mayor James K.
Hahn and his late father, former county Supervisor Kenneth Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Boyer, who headed a committee that won cityhood for Santa Clarita
in the mid-'80s, juxtaposed them during a recent public meeting on
San Fernando Valley secession, which Hahn unsuccessfully sought to
keep off the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "By contrast, his father, Kenny Hahn, got out of his sickbed for
the first time in eight months to cast the deciding vote to put Santa
Clarita on the ballot promptly," Boyer recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, Kenny Hahn did not face the dubious distinction of
being the mayor of a city threatened with being broken apart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Rodney Dangerfield, the comedian with the catch phrase "I get no
respect," will get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but not
before a little dissing. The Los Angeles City Council vote to
authorize the star was 13 to 2. Councilmen Eric Garcetti and Jack
Weiss voted against Dangerfield in a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment
of the comedian's claim to fame. "I thought at least a couple of us
should vote against it to make sure he gets no respect," Garcetti
said.</TE>
<TE>   * The Los Angeles City Council agreed last week to spend $10,000
to offer tattoo removal services at a local hospital. The vote was
taken moments after the council approved a star on the Hollywood Walk
of Fame for British rock star Ozzy Osbourne, who has more tattoos
than an Australian sailor.</TE>
<TE>   * Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon gave a speech to
the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation at the Jonathan Club last week,
but reporters were asked not to say in their stories where the event
was held. "Those are their rules. That was a condition of us going
there," said one Simon aide, who passed the request on to reporters,
some of whom agreed to it. The club has long shunned publicity, even
before it opened its membership to women in 1987 following picketing.</TE>

<TE>   Connecting the Dots</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), House minority whip,
addresses reporters after a joint meeting of the House and Senate
intelligence committees in Washington on Tuesday. The panels, meeting
behind closed doors, are seeking to determine what U.S. authorities
knew and didn't know before the Sept. 11 attacks, and why. Pelosi,
with, from left, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), Sen. Bob Graham
(D-Fla.) and Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), has said: "People talk a
great deal about connecting the dots. Well, they didn't even see the
dots. They don't understand the salience of the dots."</TE>

<HD>FBI Tried to Quash UC Protests, Records Show</HD>
<DH>Secrecy: The agency worked covertly with Reagan, CIA to
smear 'subversive' students and faculty, paper reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The FBI, working covertly with the CIA and then-Gov. Ronald Reagan,
spent years unlawfully trying to quash the voices and careers of
students and faculty deemed subversive at the University of
California, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the FBI denied engaging in such activities at the
university. But a 17-year legal challenge by a Chronicle reporter
under the Freedom of Information Act forced the FBI to release more
than 200,000 pages of confidential records covering the 1940s to the
1970s, the newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   Those documents describe the sweeping nature of the FBI's
activities and show they ranged far beyond the campus and into state
politics as the agency plotted to end the career of UC President
Clark Kerr while aiding Reagan's political career.</LD>
<TE>   Only after federal judges repeatedly ruled that the FBI had
drifted unlawfully from intelligence gathering into politics--and the
case was about to be heard by the Supreme Court--did the FBI settle,
removing much of the blacked-out material in the files.</TE>
<TE>   In its unsuccessful battle to keep them secret, the agency said
its actions had been proper--that it had merely tried to protect
civil order and national security during a time when the nation
feared communism and waged war in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are done a lot differently today," FBI spokesman Bill
Carter told the Chronicle. "The files speak for themselves."</TE>

<HD>'Head Shop' Ban Near Schools Weighed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city of Los Angeles will move forward this week on a proposal to
ban "head shops" near schools.</LD>
<LD>   The city attorney's office and the planning department are
expected to present a proposed ordinance to restrict such drug
paraphernalia businesses within 500 feet of schools to a City Council
committee Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Council members also have suggested broadening the rule by
applying it to "community facilities" such as parks and recreation
centers.</LD>
<TE>   Parents and school officials welcomed the move to restrict stores
that sell pipes for smoking marijuana and provocative posters and
T-shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "This is in kids' faces. It's promoting drugs to the kids," said
Heather Evans, a parent liaison with Fairfax High School.</TE>
<TE>   The move to ban such stores near schools was prompted by the
opening of Melrose Smoke Shop across the street from Fairfax High's
main entrance in March.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked when I learned someone would have the audacity to
open a head shop across the street from a school, and then I was
doubly shocked when I learned that this was legal," said Councilman
Jack Weiss, who represents the area and whose motion led to the
drafting of the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to plug this loophole."</TE>
<TE>   Students from the 2,600-pupil school brought the matter to Weiss'
attention. They have picketed the store and signed petitions against
it.</TE>
<TE>   People under 18 are not allowed in the store, but Evans said there
are many high school seniors over 18 who might be willing to buy its
wares for younger teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   "They have from the tiniest pipes to the largest bongs basically
to smoke drugs," Evans said. "They also have T-shirts promoting drug
smoking and sex and decals with ... sleazy sex slogans."</TE>
<TE>   Weiss added: "The issue here isn't should you be allowed to sell
those items to consenting adults. The issue is why on earth should
you be allowed to dangle this temptation right smack in front of a
school?"</TE>
<TE>   Tigran Nersesyan, owner of the store, said, "My shop is legal,"
and declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the store would remain legal once the new rules are in
place because the ban would apply only to new stores.</TE>
<TE>   So the council, along with the West Hollywood City Council and the
Los Angeles Unified School District, are urging property owner Ray
Golbari to evict Nersesyan.</TE>
<TE>   But Golbari said Friday that Nersesyan cannot be evicted because
he has a five-year lease.</TE>
<TE>   The Planning and Land Use Management Committee meeting is
scheduled for 2 p.m. on Tuesday in Room 1010 of Los Angeles City
Hall, 200 N. Spring St.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss hopes the ordinance will be approved by the end of June.</TE>

<HD>Governor Feeling Little Political Fallout From the Dot-Com
Bust</HD>
<DH>Many distance selves from politics and politicians in the
bad times as well as good.</DH>
<SE>CAMPAIGN 2002 /  One in an occasional series of conversations
with California voters.</SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO</DL>
<LD>As a psychotherapist in Silicon Valley, Samuel Rolano can testify to
the human toll of the recession and the dot-com bust. He sees the
symptoms daily: anxiety, depression, economic insecurity.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't imagine anyone who's not been affected," said the
43-year-old.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, signs of the slump are everywhere, from the vacant glass
office parks south of San Francisco to the sagging attendance at San
Jose's flashy Tech Museum. Everyone, it seems, can relate some
measure of personal woe, be it layoffs, lost business or a shriveled
stock portfolio.</LD>
<TE>   Few, however, blame Gov. Gray Davis--or any politician, for that
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Finger-pointing is ludicrous," said David Benson, a Menlo Park
business consultant whose employer has shed six of its 40 staffers
over the last year. "You can't blame any one person or any one
party."</TE>
<TE>   Nearing the midpoint of this election year, California faces a
record budget deficit and fallout from the worst economic downturn in
a decade. Davis, unpopular even with many fellow Democrats, risks
further upset by proposing an unpalatable mix of tax increases and
budget cuts to close the projected $23.6-billion gap.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, he struggles against persistent--if
unsubstantiated--accusations of trading favors in return for campaign
cash. Some of those allegations involve Oracle Corp., one of Silicon
Valley's own.</TE>
<TE>   And yet here where the recession has hit hardest, where commutes
are hellish and home prices--even now--are outlandish and still
climbing, few of those interviewed in recent weeks blame Davis for
the bad times, in the same way that few credit government for the
times that were good.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they believe it was high-tech's entrepreneurs and
investors who created the glory ride. Now that it is over, they
suggest that the end was inevitable and maybe even deserved.</TE>
<TE>   "As a friend of mine said, all of us were a little bit drunk,"
said Martin Hellman, a Stanford University engineering professor.</TE>
<TE>   At bottom, politics in Silicon Valley is about pragmatism; if
Davis has done little to inspire, at least he has been a steady
friend of high-tech. If people fault his handling of the energy
crisis, which many do, they appreciate his tolerant stance on issues
such as abortion and gay rights, which matches their own
live-and-let-live attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   If the Oracle scandal speaks to an unsavory relationship between
money and politics, it is hardly a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Big business is always looking to contribute to political
campaigns in return for favors. It's built into our political
system," said Chris Fitting, 36, a paralegal toting a bag of Subway
sandwiches back to work. "Oracle and Davis, Enron and Bush. It's all
political business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Partisan Inclination</TE>
<TE>   For years Silicon Valley was a bastion of liberal Republicanism,
finally yielding to Democrats under the care and courtship of
President Clinton. Given that partisan inclination, many now lean
toward Davis if only because he is not as conservative as Bill Simon
Jr., the Republican candidate for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Svitek, a 56-year-old geologist, had just polished off a
hamburger at Taxi's, a retro diner on Palo Alto's bustling University
Avenue, when asked his opinion of Davis. He took a long time before
responding, "OK-ish, I guess. OK-ish enough, unless someone really
inspiring came along."</TE>
<TE>   Or as psychotherapist Rolano put it, in an often-stated variant of
the lesser-evil theme, "Do I think he's wonderful? No. But I
certainly think he's better than Bill Simon."</TE>
<TE>   For all the veneration of the Internet and gaudy New Economy hype,
it is easy to forget that high-tech is a relatively young industry,
with an even shorter history of political activism.</TE>
<TE>   Until about a decade ago the prevailing sentiment toward
government was one of apathy tinged with contempt. "Do our job, keep
our heads down. We don't lobby. We're hip," was how Paul Saffo, a
Silicon Valley analyst and director of the Institute for the Future,
described the mind-set.</TE>
<TE>   That began to change as the world grew more socially and
economically connected--thanks in good part to the tools of
technology--and as the valley's population grew larger and more
dense, making the importance of matters like education and quality of
life acute. In 1992, Clinton became the first presidential candidate
to actively woo Silicon Valley, as part of his strategic makeover
into a different kind of Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, the high-tech industry raised $40 million to
defeat Proposition 211, an attorney-sponsored effort to ease the
filing of securities lawsuits. The effort was a turning point.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the industry beefed up its lobbying in Sacramento and
Washington and continued its generous campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, presidential hopefuls Al Gore and George W. Bush led a
parade of candidates through Silicon Valley as high-tech soared to
No. 8 among national political donors. Four years earlier, the
industry had ranked 33rd, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics, which tracks political giving.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Split Personality'</TE>
<TE>   The $32 million the high-tech industry gave in 2000 was roughly
divided between the two major parties, a pattern that reflects the
Valley's "split personality," said Larry Gerston, who teaches
political science at San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   "The typical voter is a person who is basically liberal on social
questions, moderate on taxation issues and libertarian when it comes
to the intrusiveness of government in their lives," said Gerston. "On
the one hand, they want things for the public good. On the other,
they don't want government interference."</TE>
<TE>   The impetus is often less philosophical than practical. Education
is about training the work force of the future. Free trade means
overseas markets. Environmentalism is a way of preserving the
outdoorsy lifestyle that has lured so many creative minds to the
valley's gentling rolling landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, the hot issues have been accounting reform--Washington's
response to the Enron scandal--and efforts to force companies to list
stock options as a bottom-line expense. The latter, in particular, is
viewed as a major threat to Silicon Valley's high risk-high reward
culture.</TE>
<TE>   "What people most value is the ability for ideas to flourish in a
free, unrestrained environment," said Donnie Fowler, a Democratic
operative with TechNet, the industry's bipartisan political action
group. At the same time, he acknowledged, "They don't want government
to turn its back either, because tech can't survive in a vacuum."</TE>
<TE>   Few, however, are looking to Washington or Sacramento to rescue
them from recession. Like many, Kurt Thywisson spoke of economic
cycles with a near-evangelical faith that eventually, assuredly,
things will turn around.</TE>
<TE>   "This is capitalism at its finest," said the 33-year-old
entrepreneur, who started his Santa Cruz software company just in
time for the bottom to fall out of the new technology market.
"Capitalist values are what make Silicon Valley thrive."</TE>
<TE>   It is an odd sort of downturn plaguing the region. There is
undeniable hardship. The tech crash cost hundreds of thousands of
people their jobs, pushing Santa Clara County's unemployment rate to
7.4% in April, compared with 1.3% just 18 months ago. Office
vacancies have soared, venture capital has dried up and scores of
once-promising companies no longer exist.</TE>
<TE>   And yet much of the distress is relative. Eric Orr, 40, who was
laid off last spring from his back office job at a Sunnyvale
electronics firm, is planning to leave Silicon Valley--"I don't see
any future here"--perhaps for Sacramento. But first he is taking a
London vacation with some of the money he squirreled away during
headier times.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of others pulled money out before the tech bubble burst;
real estate agents report multiple offers on $4-million homes, and
fixer-uppers going for $800,000 or more. There is no shortage of BMWs
plying the still-crowded roads, and discriminating shoppers can pick
up a $30 bottle of hand lotion at one of the day spas near Stanford,
then nip around the corner for a $7 bowl of egg-lemon soup.</TE>
<TE>   The average regional wage of $70,000 is twice the national figure,
and even with the setbacks of the last year, Silicon Valley has
300,000 more jobs than it did in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prevailing by Default</TE>
<TE>   "We're bearing the brunt [of the recession] just as we had a
disproportionate share of the goodies," said Stephen Levy, who has
surveyed the local scene for years as head of the Center for the
Continuing Study of the California Economy, based in Palo Alto. "But
we're not in bad shape in the sense that we've got a bunch of
industries that have fantastic long-term futures."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's challenge in the race for governor is convincing an
inherently skeptical audience that he can hasten that turnaround,
lending a hand without reaching too far into people's personal lives.
Failing that, Davis could prevail simply by default.</TE>
<TE>   Duf Sundheim, a Palo Alto attorney and chairman of the Lincoln
Club of Northern California, said members of the moderate Republican
group left a post-primary meeting with Simon convinced that he "is
not nearly as conservative as Davis and others make him out to be."</TE>
<TE>   The problem, Sundheim said, is persuading those who can't sit down
face to face with the GOP nominee. "There are millions and millions
of California voters," Sundheim said. "The test is whether [Simon] is
going to be able to get out to the average voter who he is."</TE>

<HD>Sludge Lands in Court, Where Quality's the Question</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Orange County labels it fertilizer for nonfood
farming. Not in our backyard, says Kings County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, the Orange County Sanitation District has used treated
sludge from waste water to fertilize Central Valley farmland the
agency owns.</LD>
<LD>   But Kings County, an agricultural region south of Fresno, recently
blocked that option by adopting an ordinance banning the use of
certain types of such "biosolids" as fertilizer, citing health
concerns.</LD>
<LD>   Now the sanitation district has gone to court to get the ban
lifted. District officials said the "Class B" treated sludge used by
the district is safe.</LD>
<TE>   The sanitation district owns about 1,800 acres in Kings County,
growing alfalfa, cotton and other nonfood crops. On the farm, it uses
about 25% of the 200,000 "wet tons" of the treated sludge it produces
annually. The rest goes to farms in three other counties in the
southern half of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The sewage goes through physical, chemical and biological
processes, which removes the solids as part of the waste water
cleaning process. The solids are further treated to reduce
disease-causing organisms, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites.</TE>
<TE>   Kings County officials refused to comment on the lawsuit, which
was filed in May at the county courthouse in Hanford.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance was approved last year because of concerns by
farmers that the public will avoid their food crops in the belief
that they would be contaminated. The county now allows use only of
highly treated sludge, such as compost or fertilizer pellets with no
detectable pathogens.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance states that there is a "lack of adequate scientific
understanding concerning the risk that ... sewage sludge may pose to
land, air, ground water, surface waters and to ... health."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Woodruff, attorney for the sanitation district, said the
district filed the suit after negotiations with Kings County broke
down and its ordinance was passed. He said the ordinance violates
federal guidelines, which allow the use of the solids on nonfood
crops.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district said much of the concern has centered on
the use of Class B treated sludge on food crops, which sanitation
district officials said isn't done.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a perception problem," said Layne Baroldi, legal and
regulatory affairs liaison for the district.</TE>

<HD>Bill Targets Electoral Process in South Gate</HD>
<DH>Recall: Secretary of state asks for measure giving county
control of special elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Secretary of State Bill Jones on Sunday announced legislation that
would force the city of South Gate to let the county run its special
elections for the next two years.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual request for legislative action marks an escalation in
the struggle between city leaders and the state's top elections
official over who has authority over the electoral process in South
Gate, a working-class community in southeast Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is control of a recall drive launched in October by
residents against the city's leading officials: Treasurer Albert
Robles and his council majority allies, Vice Mayor Raul Moriel, Mayor
Xochilt Ruvalcaba, and Councilwoman Maria Benavides. Residents say
the officials are corrupt, accusations the officials deny.</LD>
<TE>   City leaders have defied Jones' previous order to hand over its
elections, saying he lacks authority. But Jones said he will follow
through on his vow to restore public confidence in the city that he
describes as having the state's most corrupt electoral process. "The
[South Gate] council majority is using the people's resources against
them to thwart their constitutionally guaranteed right to recall.
This cannot be allowed to stand," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   In a sudden reversal of policy, city officials are to consider a
resolution today authorizing a county takeover.</TE>
<TE>   Moriel declined to comment on his stance, but he criticized Jones'
move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's appalling," he said. "What are the rest of cities in the
state of California going to say about this? I'm astonished that he
would take those steps."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, a proposed special statute that would apply only to
South Gate, would require any recall or special election through 2003
to be administered by the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder's
office.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is to be considered Tuesday by the Assembly Committee on
Elections and Reapportionment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quick Action Sought</TE>
<TE>   Because Jones is seeking urgency legislation, it would require a
two-thirds vote of the Legislature. Jones said the measure has
bipartisan support and that he hopes for its passage before lawmakers
take their summer recess.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate recall organizers say they have gathered more than
8,000 signatures, far more than the 20% of registered voters required
to qualify for the ballot. But the recall has stalled as the courts
and Jones sort through a series of countermeasures launched by the
council majority.</TE>
<TE>   The most contentious involves the council's move replacing the
elected clerk with its own official, Julia Sylva. An attorney, Sylva
has links with some of the council majority's political allies, some
of whom she has represented. Sylva insists that she is impartial and
has not blocked the process.</TE>
<TE>   But Jones accused her of manipulating the recall. In March, he
ordered the city to hand over elections to the county or City Clerk
Carmen Avalos. But the city refused.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, in addition to seeking legislative action, said he has not
ruled out pursuing criminal charges or legal actions against
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unprecedented situation," he said. "I've not seen a
similar situation where you have all the divergent problems that you
see in South Gate."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the alleged irregularities involve violence.</TE>
<TE>   After a recall organizer served the documents last year, his fleet
of plumbing vans were set aflame in what police believe was a
politically motivated attack. The crime has not been solved.</TE>
<TE>   Jones' moves have received support from elected officials and
authorities outside South Gate, including Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley.
Recall supporters hope the legislation would finally clear the way
for an election.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives us confidence that there won't be any monkey business,"
said Stephen Kaufman, an attorney representing recall organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba, who has been among Jones' harshest critics, said she
now supports county involvement, even though she voted against it in
March.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they can be fair and impartial," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said he was skeptical that the city would follow through.
The entire process, he said, has been marred by manipulative tactics.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have done it any time," he said, "but they chose not
to. So at this stage we're moving forward."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Still Pushing Pet Projects</HD>
<DH>Budget: 'Pork' spending scores political points. But the
state, with a $23-billion deficit, may not be able to afford a trade
office in Armenia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Not even the prospect of a $23.6-billion deficit and deep program
cuts has kept lawmakers from pushing their own pet projects as
negotiations get underway on a new state budget.</LD>
<LD>   Scattered throughout the 400-page working version of the 2002-03
spending plan are proposals to open a foreign trade office in
Armenia, to forgive a $2.2-million loan to the city of Millbrae and
to give Children's Hospital of San Diego a $150,000 budget cushion.</LD>
<LD>   At the Capitol, such "pork projects" have historically constituted
a small but politically important part of the state budget. Lawmakers
covet such gems--particularly in election years--as evidence of their
success in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   For the last few years, legislators have filled thick binders with
hundreds of pages detailing their "member's request" pet projects.
This year, facing the task of closing an enormous budget gap, they
skipped the process.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, an array of proposals that at best do nothing to help
get the state out of the red have found their way onto the agenda of
the legislative committee negotiating the budget, much to the dismay
of some committee members.</TE>
<TE>   "We all care about our districts, but when the state as a whole is
having the trouble it's having, that needs to come before a specific
special interest in one's district," said Assemblyman John Campbell,
the Irvine Republican who handles budget matters for his caucus.</TE>
<TE>   Added state Sen. Richard Ackerman, another Irvine Republican and
Campbell's counterpart in the upper house: "Some of them are hard to
find this year. They're buried pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   One of the first items to grab Ackerman's attention was a proposal
for the state to forgive the $2.2-million loan to Millbrae for
flood-damage repair.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this is a 'member's request,' " Ackerman said during a
meeting of the budget conference committee.</TE>
<TE>   Betty Yee, chief deputy director of the state Department of
Finance, warned the committee that forgiving the loan could set a
precedent. The committee rejected the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly afterward, however, Assemblyman Lou Papan, the Democrat
who represents Millbrae, showed up in the committee hearing room and
stared down members until Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), chairman of
the six-member budget conference committee, which consists of
Republicans and Democrats from both houses, announced that the item
would be placed on a list for reconsideration.</TE>
<TE>   Later came an item dear to Peace that would establish a
supplemental payment rate--$150,000 in aid--for Children's Hospital
of San Diego to help cover costs in the facility's long-term care
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman weighed in, noting that his caucus had flagged the item
as a "member's request." Yee also warned against treating one
hospital differently from the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I obviously support this request," Peace said. "It's a San Diego
request."</TE>
<TE>   Peace reluctantly recommended that the committee approve Senate
language that did not include the $150,000 for the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing I like more than going back to San Diego and
saying that we can't give them $150,000," Peace said sarcastically.
"But we can't."</TE>
<TE>   A proposal to spend $149,000 to open a foreign trade office in
Armenia also raised eyebrows. The idea appears in legislation by Sen.
Jack Scott, the Altadena Democrat who represents Glendale. Roughly
one-third of the city's 190,000 residents are of Armenian descent.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento trade analyst Jock O'Connell described the proposal as
bizarre.</TE>
<TE>   "The country has the economy roughly the size of the Arden Fair
mall," said O'Connell, referring to a Sacramento area shopping
center.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connell said money for trade offices would be better spent on
the state's export finance program, which encourages commercial banks
to finance export transactions by small and medium-sized California
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Stone, a spokesman for Scott, took issue with O'Connell's
mall remark, saying Armenia's economy is growing at an average annual
rate of 7%. Stone contends that the country could serve as a viable,
expanding trade market for California.</TE>
<TE>   When the item came up for consideration last week, Assembly Budget
Committee Chairwoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach) said it would be
inconsistent to open a new trade office given that the Assembly has
proposed eliminating all funds for such offices. The committee took
Oropeza's lead and did not approve the request.</TE>
<TE>   While she opposed Scott's request, Oropeza pushed for $150,000 to
distribute "human rights and genocide model curriculum" to
"appropriate middle and high school teachers" statewide. Peace warned
Oropeza that she could be opening a can of worms.</TE>
<TE>   "If we start down this path, it's multiplied by 120 every time we
do it," he said, referring to the number of state lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Committee members failed to reach a consensus on the issue last
week and it remains open to debate.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers drew a line at spending $927,000 on a program called
Fishing in the City, which Oropeza also championed during a hearing.
Ackerman questioned whether this was a member's request, and was told
that all cities could apply for the money.</TE>
<TE>   After the committee voted not to fund the program, a disappointed
Oropeza remarked on all the city children who would not get to fish.
Peace, putting a lighter spin on the outcome, replied: "Look at all
the fish we saved."</TE>

<HD>Some Farmers Growing Rich on Government Crop Subsidies</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: A handful of large operators in California
have reaped millions in U.S. payouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX and ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FRESNO</DL>
<LD>From its gated headquarters in the suburbs here, the Britz family
runs a farming behemoth with arms that stretch across the vast middle
of California. It is a multimillion-dollar empire that includes a
petrochemical company, packinghouses, a cotton gin and tens of
thousands of acres of irrigated cropland.</LD>
<LD>   But the Britzes--whose houses sit amid country clubs and not
cotton fields--also get a big helping hand from Uncle Sam. Their 14
separate farming entities have collected $4.6 million in federal crop
subsidies over the last six years alone, according to U.S. Department
of Agriculture figures.</LD>
<LD>   This was the year Washington was supposed to shut off the valve of
crop supports to rural California and the rest of America's farm
belt, saving taxpayers billions of dollars while letting a free
market balance supply and demand. But farmers have watched commodity
prices fall to new lows in the face of increased foreign competition.</LD>
<TE>   So Congress last month decided to perpetuate--and even enhance--a
program of subsidies that was conceived in the Great Depression to
help struggling family farmers but will continue to provide millions
to big growers like the Britzes. Over the next decade, crop supports
will cost American taxpayers an estimated $190 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "The lion's share of the money in California goes to a handful of
big dogs," said Ken Cook of the Environmental Working Group, a
Washington-based nonprofit organization that is trying to reform the
farm subsidy system. "The dirty little secret is that 10% of the
recipients in California get 67% of the money. And these are the guys
who least need it."</TE>
<TE>   As the noise of this spring's farm debate has died down, it has
left behind the question of which farmers in California--big or
small, successful or struggling--benefit most from crop subsidies
that have totaled $2.8 billion since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents say the money goes to farms of every size and helps
keep food affordable. It doesn't line the pockets of farmers, they
say, but is plowed right back into the soil. It is spent at local
tractor dealers and hardware stores. It pays $7-an-hour jobs for
laborers who come from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Most Crops Not Eligible</TE>
<TE>   But only 9% of California's 74,000 farms have actually received
subsidy payments and nearly two-thirds of the money since 1996--$1.8
billion--has gone to fewer than 3,500 farms. Most of the crops that
fuel the state's $29-billion farm machine--grapes, peaches, plums,
nectarines, strawberries, almonds, walnuts and vegetables of every
hue--don't get a penny of aid. They aren't eligible.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the bulk of the money goes to support giant fields of
cotton, rice, wheat and barley--crops that exist in surplus. Of the
top 20 recipients in California, seven are big cotton growers and 11
are big rice growers. On average, they take in $596,000 in crop
subsidies a year.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these farmers can be found in coffee shops such as
Pardini's in Fresno, where they bemoan falling crop prices and
grumble about Washington poking its finger in their business,
dictating to them about endangered species on their land and polluted
water in their irrigation ponds.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it hypocrisy to receive government payments and then bad-mouth
the same government when it tries to enforce laws like the Endangered
Species Act?" asked Marvin Meyers, a cotton and almond farmer who has
received nearly $2 million in crop subsidies since 1996. "You betcha
it's hypocritical."</TE>
<TE>   Other farmers say it isn't hypocrisy but a matter of survival.
Without government supports, they say, crops such as rice simply
wouldn't be grown here. It costs $700 to $800 to produce an acre of
California rice that fetches just $650 in the world market. "Right
now, I don't see any way out of it," said Dave Womble, a Colusa
County supervisor and subsidized farmer.</TE>
<TE>   The towns that the payments help prop up--Buttonwillow, Huron,
Corcoran, Arbuckle--are among the poorest in the state. Jobless rates
range from 12% to 18%. Lavishing more payments on a handful of
farmers won't ease the hard times, supporters of the new farm bill
concede. Taking them away, though, could make things even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "These aren't farmer subsidies. They are consumer subsidies," said
David Unruh of the Farm Service Agency in Kings County, the arm of
the USDA that hands out subsidy checks. "The farmer is the vehicle
through which the government ensures an adequate supply of reasonably
priced food and fiber. It extends to all Americans."</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Working Group believes that such talk is just a
rationalization for a policy that benefits the few. The group has
posted on the Internet a county-by-county breakdown of six years of
payments, showing hundreds of thousands of dollars going to people
who look nothing like struggling farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Here in the heart of California's farm belt, the list includes
wealthy doctors, lawyers, home builders and a man named Ed Donaghy,
who built his fortune as a major distributor of Budweiser beer across
the central San Joaquin Valley. It includes beef baron John Harris
and members of the winemaking Gallo family--power brokers who donate
large sums of money to state and national politicians.</TE>
<TE>   It also extends to people like Jack Woolf, a man regarded by his
peers as proudly independent and who helped turn this arid land into
the most productive agricultural region in the world. The Woolf
family, which farms about 15,000 acres in Fresno County and owns
three vacation houses overlooking the Pacific in Santa Cruz, has
received nearly $1 million in subsidies since 1996.</TE>
<TE>   In the town of Firebaugh on the west side of Fresno County--where
$58 million in crop supports has flowed to 203 growers since
1996--Marvin Meyers runs his farming operation from a small rundown
office.</TE>
<TE>   If he had his choice, Meyers said, he wouldn't take a cent from
the federal government to farm his 4,000 acres that stretch from
flatland to hillside. But cotton that costs $1,200 an acre to produce
now sells for $1,400.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'We're Not Fat Cats'</TE>
<TE>   Meyers said he simply can't afford to thumb his nose at $333,000 a
year in government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not fat cats. We don't drive fancy cars. We don't own boats
or summer homes on the coast," said the 68-year-old Los Angeles
transplant, dipping his thick fingers into a tin of Copenhagen
chewing tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   His six square miles of farmland may sound like a lot to city
folk, he says, but it takes such scale to survive in a marketplace
flooded by fiber from China and Egypt and grain from South America.</TE>
<TE>   "My truck has 64,000 miles on it, and my son's has more than twice
that," he said during a 90-minute tour of his land. "No one gave us
anything. Everything you see here, we've worked hard for."</TE>
<TE>   Meyers and his son, Greg, 40, work the land side by side with 30
full-time employees. The company's $1-million payroll is one of the
few bright spots in the hard-luck town. Meyers has taken illegal
migrants and turned them into U.S. citizens with $40,000-a-year
salaries. He does all his trading within a 20-mile radius. "All that
subsidy money stays here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He's doing all he can to wean his farm off federal aid, he said.
He has chopped his cotton acres in half, converting from subsidized
fiber to free-market almonds. It means more money and no guilt about
accepting government help.</TE>
<TE>   "Almonds, that's where it's at for us," Meyers said. "You come
back in a few years and we won't be growing cotton. If we are, it's
going to be a variety that isn't subsidized."</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of Kings County sits a huge dry lake bed where
America's biggest cotton farms roll out for miles. Seven families
with roots three generations deep farm 250,000 acres of clay-bottom
land.</TE>
<TE>   The cotton and grain fields of the Hansens, Gilkeys, Newtons,
Boyetts and Howes have yielded a collective $14 million in federal
subsidy payments since 1996. But it is another operation--one that
everyone counted as dead only a decade ago--that stands at the top of
California's subsidy list. Dublin Farms, run by the McCarthy family,
has collected $7.2 million in subsidies over the last six years.</TE>
<TE>   The checks kept coming even though the federal government tried
for years to collect $1.3 million in subsidy overpayments to a
McCarthy entity in the late 1980s, documents show. At the time,
Richard McCarthy fended off government bill collectors by saying he
was flat broke after suffering a heart attack and $7 million in farm
losses. The McCarthys eventually paid back the debt.</TE>
<TE>   But the once-highflying clan, with their helicopter and corporate
jet, found an unusual ticket back to big farming and large subsidies:
urban sewage. Each year, Los Angeles County alone pays the McCarthys
$5.6 million to accept, spread and compost 200,000 wet tons of
treated sewage on their land.</TE>
<TE>   Now their growing size is prompting complaints from neighbors that
the McCarthys are farming parcels that don't belong to them, not only
to spread more sludge but to harvest more crop subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of small adjacent landowners have asked the local Farm
Services Agency to intervene. They say Dublin Farms has collected
subsidy payments on 151 acres that belong to them. The McCarthys did
not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   "The Farm Service Agency has refused to do anything," said Norma
Rulison, head of the landowner group. "We've asked the McCarthys to
pay us for farming our land and taking our subsidies, but they
refuse. These guys give new meaning to the word chutzpah."</TE>
<TE>   Unruh, the head of the local Farm Service Agency, said he couldn't
recall whether complaints by Rulison's group triggered an inquiry
into subsidy overpayments to the McCarthys.</TE>
<TE>   "You're talking about something two or three years ago," he said.
"That's a long, long time ago around here."</TE>
<TE>   Given the green light from Congress, farmers with far more wealth
than the McCarthys have used their extensive holdings to create
manifold entities that qualify for even more subsidy payments.</TE>
<TE>   Few have done it more aggressively than the Britz family, whose
net worth would appear to dwarf that of many small farming towns.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Glassman, a Britz son-in-law who runs much of the family's
operations, didn't want to talk about the $4.6 million in farm
subsidies. "I have no comment on any of our programs. What you got is
what you got," he said, hanging up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   In Five Points, population 70, the lime-green color of Britz looms
everywhere. Five Points is Britz, its sprawling chemical distribution
center, its cotton gin and labor camp and rich brown fields.</TE>
<TE>   The men in the family may dress like farmers, wearing blue jeans
and cotton work shirts, but they and their wives drive
Mercedes-Benzes and bright red Cadillacs. They live in big houses,
far from the fields, that look out on private golf courses. They own
vacation cottages that nudge up to the shores of Lake Tahoe, land
records show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Britz a Farming Giant</TE>
<TE>   When Albert Britz, a Berkeley-educated chemist who founded the
family's fertilizer company 54 years ago, and his wife, Helen, died
in 1986, they left a $23-million estate to their three grown
children, David, Linda and Martin. With the vision of Glassman,
Linda's husband, the Britz heirs have moved into the business of
lending.</TE>
<TE>   If a grower can't pay his Britz pesticide bill, Britz Investment
steps in as "a bank of last resort." The farms gained through loan
defaults have helped turn Britz from a pesticide seller to a
diversified farming giant with 19,000 acres of cotton, wheat,
alfalfa, grapes, oranges, tomatoes and sugar beets, county records
show.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical company generates $229 million in yearly sales,
according to company records filed in a recent court case.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 financial statement for Britz Fertilizer shows a
$5.3-million net profit and a combined $2.4 million in salaries for
company Chief Executive David Britz, Secretary Martin Britz and Chief
Financial Officer Glassman.</TE>
<TE>   "The Britz family is worth tens of millions of dollars," said
Butch Wagner, a Fresno attorney who gleaned the financial records
while winning a lawsuit on behalf of a fired company employee. "The
notion that they are milking the federal government for millions more
is shameful."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, millions of dollars worth of subsidized federal water
flows to Britz farms in the Westlands Water District.</TE>
<TE>   The family has divided its immense land holdings into smaller
trusts and partnerships because federal reclamation law limits
subsidized water to farms no larger than 960 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Crop subsidies also go to farms that have a number of ties to
Britz. For instance, $525,000 in checks have gone to "San Mateo
Farms," which in 1999 listed its mailing address as 16423 W. Kamm
Ave. in Helm, the same as the Britz cotton gin.</TE>
<TE>   San Mateo's co-owner, Howard Jones, was a longtime Britz chemical
salesman before he retired last year.</TE>
<TE>   He said the crop loans for the 1,913-acre farm come from Britz
Investment and the farming equipment belongs to Britz. Britz applies
the pesticides and gins the cotton.</TE>
<TE>   As for the subsidy payments to San Mateo since 1996, Jones said
the money went to him and two partners, who also are top Britz
employees. "I took the subsidy money," he said. "Only I don't
remember it being that much."</TE>

<HD>Tequila to Rattle the Innards</HD>
<DH>Alcohol: A Mexican bar sells firewater from jars with a
snake inside. The drink appeals to college students and people who
say it's medicinal.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ENSENADA</DL>
<LD>Dropping into Francisco Dario's cantina in a remote canyon southeast
of this tourist resort can be perilous.</LD>
<LD>   As the gray-haired jack-of-all-trades invites visitors into the
establishment built in the shadow of Mt. Pico del Diablo, he warns
them not to tap on a jar containing an angry rattlesnake.</LD>
<LD>   But he doesn't seem too nervous about filling a shot glass with a
wooden ladle full of the crude and fiery spirit tequila con vibora.
Rattlesnake tequila.</LD>
<TE>   Dario's hideaway may be the last in northern Baja California to
serve this most elemental form of Mexico's national spirit--a folk
remedy to many natives and a cross-cultural dare for hard-partying
college kids.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where much of the tequila industry has turned
sophisticated--with handblown bottles and years of aging in oak
casks--Dario offers a whole coiled rattlesnake soaking in every
reclaimed juice jar on his bar.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing subtle about this rough elixir he serves up at
the Rancho Agua Caliente, an 800-acre natural hot spring at the end
of a dirt road off Baja's Highway 3, roughly two hours south of San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Sliding a brimming shot glass across his dark Formica-topped bar,
the 46-year-old ranch manager smiles and urges: "Try it. It calms the
nerves, and is a fine remedy for arthritis, kidney problems and
cancer."</TE>
<TE>   Laden with pinkish scales and snake pulp, it goes down like liquid
fire.</TE>
<TE>   Dario was taught how to make the stuff, which goes for about a
buck a shot, by a previous manager who reportedly learned the process
from a Japanese business partner.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning on the bar, he said, "I catch a snake myself with a
special stick. Then I drop it into a jar [alive] and fill it with a
gallon or so of cheap white tequila."</TE>
<TE>   In its death throes, the snake emits minute amounts of compounds
with certain medicinal properties, Dario contends.</TE>
<TE>   "After it's dead, I gut the snake and put it back in the jar," he
said. "Then I put the jar in the sun for three months, then in the
shade for three months."</TE>
<TE>   "After all that, it's ready to serve," he added. "One snake is
good for three years [of soaking]. I prefer red diamondbacks."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Dario's customers--who come from across Mexico as
well as from Korea, China, Italy, San Francisco and Los
Angeles--don't keel over on the spot may have to do with the
product's exposure to sunlight. Rattlesnake venom breaks down in high
temperatures, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Dario's product is not unique. Alcoholic drinks
featuring poisonous serpents are common "cure-alls" in rural areas
throughout the world, said Russ Smith, curator of reptiles and
amphibians at the Los Angeles Zoo.</TE>
<TE>   "In India, they use cobras. In Japan, pit vipers," he said. "These
are relatively safe mixtures because the venom has to be injected
into the bloodstream to be harmful."</TE>
<TE>   Don Boyer, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the San Diego
Zoo, is more concerned with the fate of the snakes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've actually been to Rancho Agua Caliente and talked to the
owners," he said. "I told them, 'I like tequila as much as anyone.
But, gee, do you really have to kill rattlesnakes?' "</TE>
<TE>   Locals, however, say tequila con vibora is disappearing from the
cultural scene in Baja California, where the biggest cities are being
rapidly transformed by new high-tech businesses, seaside developments
and waves of retirees from the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "In years past, every local cantina had a pickle jar full of it
stashed somewhere; not anymore," said John Bragg, who keeps one of
the world's largest collections of tequila, North America's first
distilled spirit, at his Pancho's restaurant in Cabo San Lucas.</TE>
<TE>   Among his more than 500 tequilas is tequila con vibora.</TE>
<TE>   "We sell over 50 gallons a year of it at $4 a shot to mostly
American college kids, who make a big deal out of it," he said.
"Sometimes they make me haul the snake out so they can get a picture
holding it."</TE>

<TE>   In the Ensenada area, however, rattlesnake elixirs are no laughing
matter.</TE>
<TE>   At the Centro Botanicas de Ensenada herbal shop, clerk Martha
Saldivar said, "Some people eat rattlesnake meat to purify their
blood. Others use rattlesnake oil to cure baldness. Some musicians
put rattlers inside their guitars to improve the sound."</TE>

<TE>   "Much of Mexico still believes in the healing powers of herbs and
plants and other natural products, and Francisco is part of that
tradition," he said. "I see him at least once each summer for a shot

<HD>MTA to Aid North County</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Agency seeks public comment on a plan to widen
freeways and boost mass transit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To relieve traffic congestion in Los Angeles County's rapidly growing
northern region, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is
proposing expanding freeways and improving public transit over the
next several years.</LD>
<LD>   The projects include adding carpool lanes and a regular traffic
lane to the Golden State Freeway in the Santa Clarita Valley between
Calgrove Boulevard and the Antelope Valley Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The Antelope Valley Freeway also would be widened between Sand
Canyon Road and Avenue P so that the entire stretch would have three
continuously flowing lanes in each direction.</LD>
<TE>   To encourage the use of mass transit, the MTA proposes increasing
Metrolink service from the Antelope and Santa Clarita valleys to
downtown Los Angeles from five trains with a total of 17 cars to
seven trains carrying a total of 47 cars.</TE>
<TE>   With an envisioned completion date of 2010, the projects require
approval from the state Department of Transportation and
Metrolink--as well as funding, said Brian Lin, project manager for an
MTA study of the north county.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is seeking public comment about these projects and
other transportation issues through meetings this week in Palmdale
and Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   The transit proposals were suggested in a $4.4-million MTA study,
begun last August, that will also examine ways to improve the
Pearblossom Highway.</TE>
<TE>   That phase of the study is expected to conclude in another year
and half.</TE>
<TE>   The total cost of these projects has not been calculated, but
transportation planners say they are sorely needed to accommodate the
region's explosive growth.</TE>
<TE>   Population in the Santa Clarita Valley, currently about 200,000,
may balloon to more than 350,000 by 2025, according to estimates by
the Southern California Assn. of Governments. Over the same period,
the Antelope Valley is expected to grow even faster, from about
380,000 to nearly 900,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is also considering longer-term projects that could
include adding more carpool lanes to the Golden State and Antelope
Valley freeways by the year 2025, in addition to those already
proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the long time frame, north county residents say they are
eagerly awaiting any relief from their horrible commutes, made worse
by the many big-rigs crowding the freeways.</TE>
<TE>   "The trucks will often shut commuter traffic to a standstill,"
said Frank Ferry, mayor of Santa Clarita and co-chair of Santa
Clarita Valley Transportation Alliance. The MTA will hold a meeting
tonight from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Palmdale Cultural Center, 38350
Sierra Highway in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   A second meeting will be held Thursday from 6 to 8 p.m. inside
Santa Clarita City Hall's council chambers at 29920 Valencia Blvd.,
Santa Clarita.</TE>

<HD>Dispute Over Size of UFW Is Reopened</HD>
<DH>Labor: An industry lawyer says he has proof the farm
workers group inflates its membership numbers. Union officials
contend he's wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Reigniting a debate over the clout of the United Farm Workers union,
a farm industry attorney is accusing the UFW of overstating its
membership in an effort to bolster the union's reputation and help
win converts in the fields.</LD>
<LD>   Rob Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural
Assn., has long accused the union of inflating its numbers, but he
now believes he has proof in the form of an amended federal document
in which the UFW lowers its membership estimates by nearly 80%.</LD>
<LD>   From 1995 to 1999, the UFW claimed membership of 26,000 on reports
filed annually with the U.S. Department of Labor. The union upped
that figure to 27,000 in 2000. But last month, in response to an
inquiry by the Labor Department, the union revised its membership to
5,945, according to the amended report.</LD>
<TE>   "Here they are portraying themselves as the voice of California
farm workers, and yet they represent less than 1%," said Roy, who
fired off a letter in February prompting the Labor Department probe.</TE>
<TE>   However, union officials say the lower number represents only
those laborers working under UFW contract at the end of the year, and
not the total number of members who work under contract on a seasonal
basis at least one day during the year.</TE>
<TE>   UFW President Arturo Rodriguez said labor officials directed the
union to use the year-end number, even though they were told it
reflected only a fraction of those on the union's membership rolls. A
Labor Department official in Los Angeles confirmed that the UFW, like
all other labor organizations, was instructed to report only those
members working at year's end and acknowledged that seasonal
employment could cause that number to fluctuate.</TE>
<TE>   For the UFW, Rodriguez said the year-end number is particularly
misleading because it only counts union members working under
contract on Dec. 31, a traditionally slow time in agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Roy's contention that the amended number is close to
accurate, Rodriguez maintains that the number of rank-and-file,
dues-paying members stands at 27,000, a total boosted in recent years
by an organizing drive that has put thousands of laborers--from
Washington state to Florida--to work under the UFW's black-and-red
Aztec eagle banner.</TE>
<TE>   "The union is anything but dying at this point," said Rodriguez,
who became UFW president after the death of founder Cesar Chavez in
1993.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there are too many labor unions having the number
of elections we are and gaining new membership like we are," he
added. "People like Rob Roy have been trying to destroy our
reputation ever since we started. We are honestly out there
representing workers and the communities they live in."</TE>
<TE>   Growers for years have challenged the validity of the UFW's
membership claims, a spinoff of the bitter and often brutal battles
that have marked the union's struggle for better wages and working
conditions for America's poorest working class.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the union's strength and influence in the fields have
waned over the years, yet UFW officials continue to lean on Chavez's
legacy, often as a way of drawing donations from independent
benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   Union dues totaled $1.8 million in 2000. Citizen contributions
totaled nearly twice that.</TE>
<TE>   James Bogart, president of the 300-member Grower Shipper Assn. of
Central California in Salinas, said the disparity between dues and
contributions lends credence to his view that the union has become
more of a social and political movement than a traditional labor
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any harm in [the union's concentration on social and
political work], but they shouldn't go around holding themselves up
as a labor organization if their focus is elsewhere," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bogart joined Roy in 1998 in conducting a survey of UFW membership
in California. Roy said the survey, conducted as part of his work as
chairman of the American Bar Assn.'s subcommittee on state
agricultural developments, was sent to companies with known UFW
contracts. It showed that the union had 32 contracts covering about
7,000 workers in California at the end of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusting for out-of-state contracts and recent election
victories, Roy now estimates UFW membership to be, at most, 8,000
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Roy said he also tackled the membership question from a different
angle. He took the total dues collected by the UFW, $1.8 million in
2000 as reported to the Labor Department, and divided by the total
number of dues-paying members reported by the union, 27,000. Because
workers pay 2% of their gross salaries to the union in dues, Roy said
UFW members would earn on average of only about $3,000 a year, a
figure that is low even for traditionally low-paid farm work.</TE>
<TE>   Roy disputes a host of other UFW contentions, including claims
that it has added 7,000 members since 1994. His research shows that
in California, the UFW has won 16 elections between 1994 and 2000,
earning the right to represent 4,094 workers. However, not all of
those resulted in contracts with employers.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, much about the UFW is smoke and mirrors," Roy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Calling Roy's analysis flawed and his information incomplete, UFW
leaders say the union has made great strides since 1994, when
Rodriguez, as new UFW president, pledged to rebuild the struggling
organization by returning to field organizing.</TE>
<TE>   Once a formidable national presence, with upward of 80,000 members
at its peak in 1973, the union had suffered decades of declining
membership and was barely at 20,000 members when Chavez died 20 years
later.</TE>
<TE>   Since that time, UFW leaders say the union has won 21 elections,
including votes at the Chateau St. Michelle Winery in Washington and
at Quincy Farms in Florida, that state's top producer of fresh
mushrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The union also has picked up its organizing work across
California, producing historic victories at Gallo of Sonoma and at
the Coastal Berry Co. in Oxnard, where more than 750 pickers are
covered by a landmark contract that gives the UFW its first major
stake in the state's tough-to-organize strawberry industry.</TE>
<TE>   UFW leaders say they have negotiated 25 new contracts, some
stemming from earlier election victories, encompassing about 7,000
workers since the launch of the organizing drive. That assertion is
supported by the fact that the union is now collecting more than
twice the amount of dues it was collecting eight years ago, leaders
say.</TE>
<TE>   But they say the numbers only tell half the story because the
union's influence extends well beyond the fields.</TE>
<TE>   It has been felt at the state Capitol, where legislators have
passed UFW-backed measures to improve worker safety and to make sure
laborers are not cheated out of wages. And it's being felt in farm
towns across the state, where UFW-supported candidates are being
elected to local, state and national offices.</TE>
<TE>   Both supporters and critics of the UFW acknowledge that in many
ways it is far more difficult now to organize the farm labor force
than it was at the peak of the union's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   One reason, experts say, is that the farm labor force, once
dominated by immigrants from northern and central Mexico, now
contains a significant share of peasants from regions to the south,
many of whom arrive here illegally. By some estimates, at least half
and as much as 70% of the labor force is undocumented, making it a
particularly hard group to organize.</TE>
<TE>   Growers contend that the union has become less necessary as
agricultural employers have conformed with a flurry of federal and
state laws added over the years to protect field laborers.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW says its organizing efforts have been hampered by
institutional impediments, including years of unfavorable rulings by
a Republican-controlled Agricultural Labor Relations Board.</TE>
<TE>   But UFW leaders say one of the main reasons the union's membership
numbers aren't higher is that organizers have had a tough time
hammering out contracts with growers, even after workers have voted
for UFW representation. Of the 428 companies in which farm workers
have voted for the UFW since 1975, only 185 have signed union
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   UFW officials say there are thousands of workers awaiting union
representation, including more than 300 at Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in
Ventura. Those workers have been without a contract since 1987, when
the farm was taken over by Tennessee-based United Foods Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an Oxnard attorney representing the UFW in
those negotiations, said legislative efforts are underway to allow
for binding third-party arbitration of agricultural labor contract
negotiations that have reached an impasse.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got all of these certifications that have not translated
into contracts, and I think it's time for the balance of power to
shift," Macri-Ortiz said. "We've got plenty of supporters just
waiting for the opportunity to become members."</TE>

<HD>Phyllis Wattis, 97; Her Gifts to the Arts Raised San
Francisco's National Profile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phyllis Wattis, one of the nation's most influential cultural
philanthropists whose generosity over five decades established her as
San Francisco's patron saint of the arts, died Wednesday of natural
causes. She was 97.</LD>
<LD>   A great-granddaughter of Mormon leader Brigham Young, she
contributed $150 million to cultural institutions in Northern
California, including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San
Francisco Opera and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Her gifts
shaped the institutions and raised the city's national profile in the
arts.</LD>
<LD>   For many years she and her husband, Paul Wattis, the late
construction and mining magnate whose company was the primary builder
of the Hoover Dam, had channeled their philanthropy through a
foundation they created in 1958. But in 1988, some years after her
husband's death, Wattis, to the astonishment of San Francisco's
cultural organizations, dispensed all of its $26 million in assets.</LD>
<TE>   Then she began giving away her capital--more than $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   That amount included more than $20 million to the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art to buy important works after critics said its
collection was unworthy of its architecturally smashing new building.
Among the acquisitions Wattis made possible were 14 works by Robert
Rauschenberg and others by Eva Hesse, Mark Rothko, Wayne Thiebaud,
Anselm Kiefer, Rene Magritte, Marcel Duchamp and Piet Mondrian.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent years, she has been the most significant supporter of
the collection and can be credited not only for what she did
individually but for the infectious nature of her giving," said Janet
Bishop, the museum's curator of painting and sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "She was someone who saw that it was possible to transform a
collection."</TE>
<TE>   Wattis also gave $20 million to the Fine Arts Museums of San
Francisco to rebuild the De Young Museum and strengthen its
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Cultural leaders such as Elaine McKeon, chairwoman of the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art's board of trustees, praised Wattis'
"bold, unapologetically modern model" of philanthropic leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Wattis did not just write staggeringly large checks. She tied
strong opinions to her money, and was widely respected for the
intelligence that informed those views.</TE>
<TE>   Harry Parker, director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco,
recalled once showing her a beautiful 8th century jade mask from
Teotihuacan, the site of the pyramids outside Mexico City. "She took
one look and said 'You've got too many masks,' " said Parker, who
conceded that she was right.</TE>
<TE>   In the museum's next pre-Columbian acquisition, he was careful to
avoid masks, choosing instead a major standing sculpture from the
period.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that's more like it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing sentimental about her giving," Parker noted.
"Money always had an agenda--to do something that was important."</TE>
<TE>   When she gave to the San Francisco Opera--about $6 million since
1985--she insisted that much of the money support new works and
emphasized to those in charge that she did not have to like what they
chose.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had the same seats at the opera for 30 years. I felt it was
my duty to get them out of 'La Boheme,' " she said wryly in
explaining her motives to the New York Times in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Among the contemporary works the opera was able to commission were
Sir Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" and Hans Werner Henze's
"The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea." Wattis' largess also
covered the entire $2-million tab for a lavish mounting of an older
work, Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire."</TE>
<TE>   Her donations to the San Francisco Art Institute reinvigorated the
faculty, inducing some early retirements to make way for fresh faces.</TE>
<TE>   "She saw the big picture, which is highly unusual in contemporary
philanthropy," said Ella King Torrey, the institute's president.</TE>
<TE>   Wattis did not give much thought to art when she was growing up in
Salt Lake City, one of six children of a sugar company executive and
a homemaker. She had music lessons that "didn't take" and could not
remember ever having visited a museum as a child.</TE>
<TE>   She attended the University of Utah, then switched to UC Berkeley,
where she completed a degree in economics. She married and, when the
headquarters of her husband's company, Utah Construction and Mining,
moved to San Francisco in 1936, she moved with him to California.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wattis liked opera but not much else in the arts. He was more
inclined to support scientific than artistic causes.</TE>
<TE>   "He was interested in golf, duck shooting, the Bohemian Club, the
usual things that men like," she once told the San Francisco
Chronicle. "I didn't start buying any art until after he died,
really, because he thought what you paid for art was so ridiculous.
He didn't ever see the value in art."</TE>
<TE>   She discovered modern art while touring Europe in the mid-1960s.
During three days at the Documenta art fair in Kassel, Germany, she
was introduced to such artists as Alexander Calder, Max Ernst and
Emil Nolde.</TE>
<TE>   After her husband died in 1971, she sold their company to General
Electric, vastly increasing her wealth. Her children showed little
interest in the family philanthropy, so she ran the foundation
virtually by herself for the next 17 years. Worried about the
management of the fund after she was gone, she decided in 1988 to
give all the money away.</TE>
<TE>   Then she dug into her own purse for more. In one year alone she
handed out $70 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I just love calling up someone to say, 'I'm sending you $2
million' and watching their jaw drop," she once told the San
Francisco Examiner. "They get so befuddled and not sure they've heard
me right."</TE>
<TE>   Wattis lived for the last 30 years in an elegant Pacific Heights
apartment designed by architect Julia Morgan and filled with art by
Warhol, Diebenkorn, Motherwell, Matisse and Jasper Johns. She added
to her personal collection until just before she died, bringing home
a striking $2.8-million painting by Ed Ruscha called "Noise."</TE>
<TE>   "It was so typical of Phyllis that in her last week of life she
was buying art," Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   She kept the same hairstyle she wore as a young bride, parted at
the side and held by a barrette.</TE>
<TE>   But advancing age never interfered with her stalwart commitment to
new or difficult artists.</TE>
<TE>   Barely a week before her death, the adventurous nonagenarian was
at the city's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, attending the first
production of an avant-garde choreographer.</TE>
<TE>   "She was in a wheelchair, but she did not miss a trick," said
Torrey of the San Francisco Art Institute. "She was going to live
every second of her life to its fullest. She was out there
discovering new things."</TE>
<TE>   Wattis is survived by a daughter, Carol Casey of San Francisco; a
son, Paul, of Paicines, in San Benito County; five grandsons, three
granddaughters and eight great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Firefighters Hold the Line on Ojai Blaze</HD>
<DH>Los Padres Forest: Cooler weather a relief for fatigued
crews battling the 21,000-acre fire. But containment remains at only
40%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weary crews battled the Wolf fire near Ojai for the ninth day Sunday,
allowing only a 55-acre growth in the blaze that has burned nearly
21,000 acres in Los Padres National Forest.</LD>
<LD>   But their job is not over, as containment remained at 40% for a
second day, and there is still no estimate on when the fire will be
fully controlled.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 2,000 firefighters from a dozen county, state and federal
agencies have attacked the blaze from land and air since it began
June 1. More than 1,500 are fighting it now.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. Forest Service officials had anticipated major progress in
containing the wildfire after three straight days of milder
temperatures and marine-layer moisture, but that did not materialize
as of Sunday evening.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we are building a line, and we're making progress,
we're not confident enough about whether the line will hold to be
able to say we're getting extra containment," forest service
spokesman Jim Turner said. "The remoteness is getting us there."</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures have hovered around 70 degrees in the rugged
wilderness about 10 miles north of Ojai since Friday, with relative
humidity ranging from 30% to 70%.</TE>
<TE>   That was a welcome shift from the conditions firefighters faced
during the first four days of the blaze: 100-degree temperatures,
20-mph winds and less than 10% humidity.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather has been cooperating in our effort to control this
fire," said Barry Peckham of the forest service.</TE>
<TE>   Most significant, Peckham said, is that crews have been able to
keep the fire from burning over the north side of the Pine Mountain
ridge and from creeping south of Sespe Creek. The threat to
structures would have been much greater had flames crossed either of
those barriers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last week, the fire charred 20,850 acres of thick,
extremely dry chaparral brush and pinyon pines. So far, it has cost
federal, state and county agencies $8.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the blaze is still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Several roads and recreation areas, including the entire Sespe
Wilderness, remain closed. California 33 is open, however, as is
Wheeler Gorge campground, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the smoke that had clouded Ojai last week has also lifted.
It was a typical Sunday as motorcycles buzzed through town, people
sat in outdoor cafes and tourists strolled the Ojai Arcade.</TE>
<TE>   National Guard helicopters continued shuttling crews between the
Sespe Wilderness and the fire command post, which is set up in Ojai's
Soule Park.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the steep terrain, firefighters have been cutting
firebreaks through the brush while air tankers and helicopters
dropped water and fire retardant.</TE>
<TE>   Some firefighters are now working 24-hour shifts on two-day trips
into the backcountry. A new helipad is being built higher on the
ridge in an attempt to get firefighters to the most remote areas of
the fire quicker, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, firefighters began using bulldozers to carve through
the brush in hopes of preventing flames from spreading to the Sespe
Condor Sanctuary about five miles away. Heavy machinery is usually
prohibited by federal restrictions that protect sensitive wildlife
habitat. Wildlife officials on Sunday continued to monitor nesting
condor chicks.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters are working to protect six cabins in Mutau Flats and
structures in the Howard Creek and Rose Valley areas, but no
evacuations have been ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a wildfire near Saugus that destroyed nine houses and
came perilously close to dozens more was expected to be fully
contained by this evening.</TE>
<TE>   As crews doused a few remaining hot spots in the 23,500 acres that
burned in northern Los Angeles County over five days, firefighters
and residents of the rural area near Santa Clarita took stock Sunday
of what happened, what could have happened and what might be in store
for them in this unusually dry fire season.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of battling the Copper fire, named after the street where
a welder's tool set off the blaze Wednesday, is projected to be $4.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   "It had attitude," said U.S. Forest Service Firefighter Aaron
Lawson, one of nearly 2,000 personnel called to battle the wildfire.
"It took off and burned like the best of them. We got ahead of it and
put it out."</TE>

<HD>Greatest Closers? The Lakers Make Their Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Before they reached the formality of winning their third consecutive
championship, the Lakers secured their legacy. This is as good a
fourth-quarter team as you'll see.</LD>
<LD>   Other teams can play as well as they can. Odds are the Lakers will
just be better when it matters most.</LD>
<LD>   When all the big chips are on the table, the Lakers have a face
card showing--and you know they're about to turn over an ace.</LD>
<TE>   They're more money than Citibank, more clutch than Jerry West.</TE>
<TE>   They might let teams hang around in games that should be finished
by halftime. But every door they leave open they eventually slam in
somebody's face. That's what makes them so cold.</TE>
<TE>   Their 106-103 victory in Game 3 of the NBA Finals wasn't anything
new. It was simply the latest example.</TE>
<TE>   Here came Jason Kidd, showing why so many people--especially on
the East Coast--thought he was the most valuable player in the NBA
this year. His boy Kenyon Martin had his back. There were the Nets,
surging to a seven-point lead in the fourth quarter, the New Jersey
fans screaming as if Bruce Springsteen just walked on stage.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Lakers dropped the curtain and turned off the lights.</TE>
<TE>   They scored on eight of their last 11 possessions. They wound up
making 60% of their shots in the quarter. And they outrebounded New
Jersey, 12-7.</TE>
<TE>   It was 94-87, New Jersey, with 6:42 left and you know what they
say about the first team to reach 100 points. Then the Lakers got
there first. They went on a 13-2 run to make it 100-96 with 2:15 to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Just when the series had a chance to get interesting, the Lakers
made it over.</TE>
<TE>   "We played our heart out," Martin said. "Very deflating."</TE>
<TE>   Join the rest of the league standing by the oxygen tank. The
Lakers have been doing this for three years now, starting in Game 2
of the second round against Phoenix in 2000. That's when Kobe
Bryant's airballs against Utah and the quarry of Shaquille O'Neal's
missed free throws went the way of the vinyl album.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant made a jumper to beat the Suns and ever since the Lakers
have won every close playoff game with two exceptions: the NBA Finals
opener against Philadelphia last year and Games 5 against the
Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference finals this year.</TE>
<TE>   They're 15-2 in games that could have gone either way during this
run. And each victory makes them that much tougher to beat. "We know
what it takes to win down the stretch," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a seasoned team," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "We know
what we want to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Zen aspects of Jackson's coaching style are overblown. He gets
asked about them every day during the Finals, and he seems a little
embarrassed by it. But there is something to the meditation and
breathing techniques he asks his players to use.</TE>
<TE>   "Until you've experienced it, it's hard to understand the nerves,
the jitters, the adrenaline flow comes with those moments," Fox said.
"You have to settle yourself to be able to make plays, to be able to
handle the ball, to be able to shoot the ball with accuracy."</TE>
<TE>   Fox stepped to the line with 3.5 seconds remaining and the Lakers
ahead by a single point. He calmly made both free throws.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it seems as though whoever's on the court for the Lakers
comes through in the clutch. Devean George's contributions to this
playoff run had been as minimal as June rainfall in L.A. But he
played 11 minutes in the fourth quarter Sunday, scored all six of his
points and snatched six of his eight rebounds--including a follow-up
dunk off a missed jumper by Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys that have been in there in the fourth quarter have been
getting it done down in the end of the game," George said. "No
difference if I'm in there. I feel that it's my job too, to step it
up."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry can have a terrible game, as he did Sunday, then make
up for it with another big three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, his three-pointer with 3:04 left was only his second field
goal of the day, but it gave the Lakers the lead for good.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers seem to execute better when they have to. It's rare to
see them have a bad possession late in the game. They concentrate
more.</TE>
<TE>   In the huddles, Jackson might unleash a few expletives ("Some of
us swear so much ourselves, it's the only thing we can understand in
terms of communication," Fox said) but he's more likely to simply
write messages on the board.</TE>
<TE>   They can read about what they're doing wrong, or what they're
missing in the triangle offense.</TE>
<TE>   "What it does, by writing it down, he gets a good chance to see
who's paying attention," Fox said. "There's a lot of messages on that
board, if you're not taking the time to stick your head in there,
you're going to go out there and mess up."</TE>
<TE>   If the Lakers do mess up in crunch time, it's a surprise. Sunday,
the Nets played well enough to win. You almost felt sorry for them.</TE>
<TE>   They just had the misfortune of playing the Lakers, doing what
they always do in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the experience of a team that's played five, six years
together," Horry said. "That's a team that's been to two
championships. That's a team that just came out of a grueling series
with Sacramento. That's just a veteran ballclub that knew how to take
control and came out to do the things it took to get a win."</TE>
<TE>   That's as clutch a team as you'll see.</TE>

<HD>NEW JERSEY VS. LAKERS/ GAME 3 REPORT</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: LAKERS 31 NEW JERSEY 23</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: A Bruce Springsteen video on the scoreboard, empty
seats in the arena, a screaming public address announcer and a "Beat
L.A." chant. How very unexpected. How very original. Ah, well, this
has been a predictable series so far. Why should Game 3 be any
different? Perhaps matters would be different if Net forward Kenyon
Martin popped somebody in the head and said bad things about his
mother. But the Nets have rolled over, as expected, in a series they
had no hope of winning, and they now are playing simply to avoid
being laughed at.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: A pulse to this series. Nothing about it has
been intriguing so far. On Sunday, neither the New York Times nor the
New York Post--hardly ever mentioned in the same sentence--ran a
story about the series on the cover of their sports sections. And
with good reason. No one, outside of Southern California and perhaps
Secaucus, N.J., seems to care.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Nets' 11-for-22 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: For the Nets, the Lakers made 12 of 22.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Shaquille O'Neal 11, Derek Fisher 9;
Nets--Martin and Jason Kidd 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Kobe Bryant and Robert Horry
3; Nets--Keith Van Horn 3, Richard Jefferson 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: LAKERS 52 NEW JERSEY 46</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Todd MacCulloch drove toward the basket and O'Neal
let him get a step, watched him launch his shot and spiked it out of
bounds. Pity that the referees determined that it was goaltending (it
was) because it underscored the Lakers' dominance over their
overmatched foes. Only the Lakers could make this a close quarter,
playing as if they were only vaguely interested in the annoying pests
buzzing around them on the court. The Big Swat would still tear up
the Nets if Coach Byron Scott decided to place backup Jason Collins
on MacCulloch's shoulders in a novel attempt to defend O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The Nets' motivation at this point has to be
based in the rock-solid belief that, if they don't play with passion
and precision, they will go down as the most overwhelmed finalists in
recent memory. The Nets did have a spark there for a few minutes in
the quarter, showing something approaching competitive fire during a
credible final four minutes of the half.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: O'Neal's 10 points on three-for-six shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Nets' seven-for-17 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 10, Bryant 6; Nets--Martin 5,
Jefferson 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Devean George 3, O'Neal and Bryant 2;
Nets--Kidd and Collins 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: LAKERS 78 NEW JERSEY 78</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Finally, there is a sign of life from New Jersey.
The Nets hit their stride toward the end of the quarter, finishing
with an 8-0 run sparked by Kidd, who began to run around the floor
the way he so often did this season. Did this mean the Nets finally
had shed the jitters that had them frozen in their tracks for much of
the first two games? The Nets were better, moving the ball and their
feet, which sounds simple enough, but proved difficult earlier. They
did precious little with the ball in Games 1 and 2 and paid for it
with a two-games-to-none deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The Lakers seemed to stand and watch as the
Nets went to a sagging zone defense that cut off the easy pass routes
to O'Neal, gambling that the Lakers could not beat them from the
outside. It worked in the final 1:39 of this quarter, giving the Nets
a bit of hope for the final quarter. The Lakers seemed unfazed, but
did little about their change in fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: Zero, the Nets' deficit at the end of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Horry played only six minutes because of foul
trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 10, O'Neal 9; Nets--Kidd 10,
Martin 9.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 2; Nets--Lucious Harris 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: LAKERS 106 NEW JERSEY 103</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Horry, saddled with four fouls, made his presence
felt with a three-point basket that completed the Lakers' rally from
a deficit that had reached seven points with 8:48 left. Bryant, with
the 24-second clock about to expire, swished a long-range jump shot
with Martin hanging on him. Suddenly, and quite remarkably, the
Lakers had a 100-96 lead with 2:17 left. O'Neal made the defensive
play of the game with 48 seconds left with a blocked shot on a
driving Kidd. As O'Neal fell to the floor hard after the block,
George alertly saved the ball to Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: An answer to the question: Was this the
Nets' best shot? They played superbly in long stretches, particularly
during a 14-0 run that took them to an 84-78 lead with 10:56
remaining. The Nets deserved credit for finally challenging the
Lakers, playing the game that got them this far. But the Nets simply
don't have any more to give.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers' late 13-4 run that gave them the lead
for the first time in the quarter with 3:04 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: For the Nets, Bryant's 36 points and O'Neal's 35 by
game's end.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 12, George 6; Nets--Kidd 11,
Martin 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--George 5, O'Neal 3; Nets--Kerry
Kittles and Kidd 2.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Are About to Wrap Up This Party</HD>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Well, that wasn't much fun while it lasted, not around here, anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, it's not over yet?</LD>
<LD>   The New Jersey Nets played their hearts out but all they got for
their sweat and tears Sunday night was a termination notice, served
up by the Lakers in the form of a come-from-behind, 106-103 victory.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers lead the NBA Finals, 3-0, and the Nets are not doubting
who the eventual winner will be and which is the better team.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys were treated to seeing three of the best players in the
world play tonight," Net Coach Byron Scott said in the interview
room. "Unfortunately, they had two of them. Kobe [Bryant] hit some
big shots and Shaq [O'Neal] was Shaq....</TE>
<TE>   "Two of their players are [in] the top five in the league. We've
got one guy, Jason [Kidd], who's the best at his position, no doubt
about that and one of the best players in the league also. We've got
a bunch of young guys that we feel are going to be up there one day
in Kenyon [Martin] and Keith [Van Horn]. We feel Richard Jefferson's
going to be fantastic.</TE>
<TE>   "All this right now for our team is a learning experience. That's
all it is. I thought we took a giant step tonight as far as competing
against the best. They [Lakers] are the best."</TE>
<TE>   OK, the Laker parade will start at noon and proceed to Staples
Center, where Phil Jackson will do his rap emcee imitation--oh, the
series isn't over yet?</TE>
<TE>   Well, it feels like it is.</TE>
<TE>   Not that everyone around here wasn't confident the Nets could dig
their way out of their 2-0 hole, but a headline in Sunday's New York
Times read:</TE>
<TE>   "Resistance Is Futile for the Nets."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote the New York Post's Pete Vecsey: "No, the Nets are not
mathematically dead, just clinically."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Mike Lupica of the New York Daily news: "This is what
happens when Cinderella runs into the Big Fella."</TE>
<TE>   Wrote Lisa Olson of the Daily News: "Laker parade next Friday."</TE>
<TE>   Under the circumstances, it was remarkable the Nets even showed
up, but one thing you have to give them--they're a brave little crew.
Too little to deal with Shaq but brave enough to keep trying.</TE>
<TE>   After two games of trying to single cover O'Neal, a mistake no
West team would make, Scott finally tried double-teaming Sunday. Not
that the Lakers were getting impatient, but before the game, Jackson
noted he thought the Nets "have adjustments to make ... to try and
stop Shaquille in a concerted team way." And he added: "Until that
time, our [shooting] percentages are great."</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, since the Nets hadn't double-teamed all season, they
didn't do it well. They came softly and late, and Shaq had his usual
21 points by halftime, by which time the Lakers had taken their usual
double-figure lead.</TE>
<TE>   This time, however, the Nets, who'd trailed by 23 points in each
of the first two games, were never down by more than 14.</TE>
<TE>   Then, trailing, 78-70, late in the third quarter, the Nets went on
a blistering 14-0 run, with Kidd scoring six of the points and
assisting on two more baskets.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers just came from seven points behind in the last 6
minutes 44 seconds with a notable contribution from Devean George,
who'd been struggling all postseason and was so discouraged after
missing an open 17-footer in the third quarter, O'Neal, Rick Fox and
Derek Fisher gathered around him to pump him up.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave it everything we had tonight," Martin said glumly.
"You've got to tip your hat to them. They didn't crack under
pressure. We came out, we played the ballgame we wanted to. Just
couldn't get it."</TE>
<TE>   So much for matchup of the Nets' dreams, if not the NBA's dream
matchup.</TE>
<TE>   While persevering through a difficult East finals against the
Boston Celtics, the Nets concluded they had become a team of destiny.
However, as they are now finding out, there are a lot of possible
destinies and theirs was to get run over by the bigger, better and
more experienced Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   This just in from he NBA Finals: It's now Dynasty 3, Destiny 0.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, sitting in the interview room with his 3-year-old son, T.J.,
in his lap, was asked if the Nets hadn't blown an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a blown opportunity, you know," he said. "The better
team won tonight."</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Before Sunday's game, New Jersey Net Coach Byron Scott issued a
common refrain from opposing coaches who want to get under the skin
of the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   "You could put [Shaquille O'Neal] on the Memphis Grizzlies, they'd
probably be in the Finals," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Thus, discounting the contributions of everyone from Laker Coach
Phil Jackson to Kobe Bryant.</LD>
<TE>   When told about the quote, Jackson was quick to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a mistaken type of generality," Jackson said. "I think it
takes a lot of playing together, it takes a lot of teamwork, it takes
a lot of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes time to put teams together that can manufacture
something like that. So I think it's a big step to say something like
that."</TE>
<TE>   After the Lakers' 106-103 victory, in which Bryant outscored
O'Neal, 36-35, Scott was asked a similar question.</TE>
<TE>   "You said if Shaq played in Memphis, they could play in the
Finals. Where does that leave Kobe?"</TE>
<TE>   Scott hedged a bit on his original remark, saying of O'Neal, "I'm
just trying to say how dominant this guy is. That's the bottom line."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Going into the spring of 1990, Pat Riley had won 98 playoff games
as a coach, and Jackson had won none.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday night, the Laker victory against the Nets gave Jackson
his 155th postseason victory, equaling Riley's NBA record.</TE>
<TE>   "I watched him for quite a while from a distance in the CBA and,
really, it was a remarkable career he's had as a coach," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite an honor to even approach his ... win record."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Rambis severely lacerated his lower leg in an accident at
Continental Airlines Arena in April, and he recalled the incident
Sunday as the team bus pulled into the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "Didn't you see the sign outside?" Rambis said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Soon to be Rambis Arena.' That's what my lawyer said."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies are among the teams expected to be interested this
summer in Laker forward Devean George, who will be an unrestricted
free agent.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise, really.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry West, the Grizzlies' new president, drafted George out of
Division III Augsburg College with the 23rd pick in 1999, and West
still likes George's potential.</TE>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>A few miles from the world famous Vince Lombardi rest stop on the New
Jersey Turnpike, the Lakers found that winning's not everything, it's
the inevitable thing.</LD>
<LD>   They are a victory from their third consecutive NBA championship,
from a sweep of the New Jersey Nets in the Finals, from making a
place alongside the accomplished teams in league history.</LD>
<LD>   They defeated the Nets, 106-103, Sunday night at Continental
Airlines Arena, and so have won the first three games of the
best-of-seven series, which could conclude here Wednesday night. No
team has lost a series after winning the first three games, and the
Lakers have not lost four consecutive games in the Phil Jackson era.</LD>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant scored 36 points and Shaquille O'Neal had 35. New
Jersey's Jason Kidd scored 30 points, then missed a 27-foot runner
that could have sent the game to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox scored the final two points on free throws with 3.5
seconds left, and Bryant scored six seconds before on a nine-foot
leaner, after nearly losing the ball in a double-team of Kidd and
Kerry Kittles. Forty seconds before that, O'Neal banked in a
turn-around jumper over Jason Collins.</TE>
<TE>   And while the Nets were more game than they had been in either of
their losses in Los Angeles, and while their home crowd pulled at
them with some verve, there is little left to decide, it would
appear, other than when the end comes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not one to make predictions," Bryant said. "It would be
disrespectful to the New Jersey Nets. That's something I don't want
to do. But what I'm saying is, I believe in our system. I believe in
my teammates."</TE>
<TE>   Net Coach Byron Scott, who won three championships as a player for
the Lakers in the '80s, smiled in spite of the chore ahead of him.
O'Neal has scored 111 points in three games, and though the Nets were
better against him in Game 3, Scott is running out of practical
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to get Mr. O'Neal and Mrs. O'Neal together
again," he said. "That's the only way you're going to be able to stop
Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think whatever you do, change the rules to try to stop
him, it's not gonna stop him. When he wants to take over a basketball
game, with his strength, size, athleticism, I mean, as agile as he is
for that big, there's nothing you can do.</TE>
<TE>   "So, if Mrs. O'Neal and Mr. O'Neal are around, if they can make
one for me, I'd really appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   It would seem unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   It was O'Neal himself who pointed out the coincidence of Bryant
winning the championship in his hometown--Philadelphia--last year,
and O'Neal having the chance to win in his this week. Game 5, if it
is necessary, would be here Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been together too long to fold," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, O'Neal located his stepfather in the stands, and
appeared to play to the man they call "Sarge." So when his free
throws fell, he peered into the seats, and when his turnarounds went,
he stared, and Phil Harrison nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what it takes," O'Neal said. "We know not to get too
happy. We know this team's not going to give us one. We have one more
game to win. We're not worried about all that other stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won their seventh consecutive Finals game, an NBA
record, though the Nets made more than half of their field-goal
attempts and led by seven points with almost seven minutes remaining,
and by six with O'Neal resting on the bench with six minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd had rejoined the series, on his way to 11 fourth-quarter
points, and Kenyon Martin was on his way to 26 points, most while
posting and turning on Fox or Robert Horry near the basket.</TE>
<TE>   For two games, the series had been all about O'Neal. That's often
the time O'Neal rears up, sticks out his tongue, pins back his ears
and ... hands the ball to Bryant. And, as the defense swirled to him,
Bryant scored 12 points in the fourth quarter, some as Phil
Jackson--poised to tie Red Auerbach with his ninth coaching
championship--glared at Bryant's defiance. Bryant made five of nine
field-goal attempts in the fourth quarter, just as Kidd did.</TE>
<TE>   "They had us down seven or so with five minutes left to play, and
we said, 'Hey, they're not used to winning, but we are,' " said Brian
Shaw, who played most of the fourth quarter in place of Derek Fisher,
despite Fisher's 13 points in the first three quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Horry made a three-pointer with 3:03 left, the Lakers led,
98-96--their first lead since the third quarter--and they never
trailed again.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets scored the final eight points of the third quarter, and
13 of the final 16, to enter the fourth quarter in a 78-78 tie. They
then scored the first six points of the fourth--two Kidd field goals
and one Kidd assist--for a 14-0 run and an 84-78 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had two 11-point leads in the third, but the Net
offense began to look more like that which Scott had in mind, with
Kidd finding cutters and Martin going hard to the rim.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets pressed and clung to O'Neal and put their hands in
Bryant's face, only to have it end badly again for them. The
locker-room grease-board messages that have counted it all down from
15 read, "Uno mas," minutes after Bryant had pointed to his biceps,
and after the Lakers' shots went, and the Nets' didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "Just one more," Horry said. "That's all we're going to focus on
now.... All we need is one more. It doesn't matter how we get it or
when we get it."</TE>
<TE>   He smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like to get it on Wednesday."</TE>

<HD>Motivation Certainly Isn't a Problem</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Fox, teammates are still upset by remarks made by
Kings and they look forward to playing them next season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Clear a spot on the New Jersey Nets' bulletin board.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers have identified the enemy and focused on their goal.
They want the Sacramento Kings. They are shooting for a FOUR-PEAT.</LD>
<LD>   The Nets?</LD>
<TE>   Apparently done.</TE>
<TE>   Three-peat?</TE>
<TE>   Apparently a fait accompli.</TE>
<TE>   That may come as news to the besieged in the opposing locker room
and the faithful in Continental Airlines Arena and around the state
of New Jersey, but the Lakers have seemingly moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Leading, 3-0, in the best-of-seven NBA Finals against the Nets,
the Lakers, whose biggest problem this season has been complacency,
have already started thinking about a source of motivation for next
season.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not very far to go in this season," said Laker forward
Rick Fox. "Just to the podium to accept our trophy. But we already
see one more on the board."</TE>
<TE>   Fox said he and his teammates have been upset by remarks made by
the Kings since they lost the seventh and deciding game of the
Western Conference finals to the Lakers last week, remarks made by
Coach Rick Adelman and several players. They have questioned what
they see as favorable treatment for Laker center Shaquille O'Neal by
the officials and declared that they still feel they are the better
team.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been some talk around our locker room," Fox said. "Guys
are [upset]. Kobe has said he is going to put in double time this
summer. Shaq says he's going to do his body right this summer. There
is definitely some talk about making it more than just this year. The
Kings just keep yapping on and on."</TE>
<TE>   Teams normally shy away from making predictions about the season
ahead. They feel enough pressure over the season at hand. When
then-coach Pat Riley, in the euphoria of the celebration following
the Lakers' clinching victory in the 1987 Finals, guaranteed a second
consecutive title in 1988, several players playfully said they wanted
to strangle him. When Riley tried to open his mouth after the Lakers
had indeed won that second championship, someone placed a gag over
his mouth.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was Byron Scott, now the Nets' coach, who first
coined the phrase three-peat as a member of a Laker team that was
shooting for a third consecutive title in the 1988-89 season.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Riley who cashed in on the term by getting a copyright
on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe we can cut a deal with Riley," Fox said, "so we can say it
as many times as we like. But first we have to reach it."</TE>
<TE>   It sounds as if the Lakers have no doubts they will do so, they
hope as early as Game 4 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Was that Riley sighted at the patent office inquiring about
four-peat?</TE>
<TE>   Fox has thoroughly enjoyed his stay in the New York area. Saturday
night, he went to see his wife, singer-actress Vanessa Williams, in
the Broadway play "Into The Woods." Fox and Williams hadn't seen each
other since April Fool's Day.</TE>
<TE>   And on Sunday night, Fox calmly stepped to the line with 3.5
seconds left, stared into the crowd, which was wildly waving white
cylindrical balloons to distract him, and sank the free throws that
all but assured a three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to take anything away from the fans," Fox said, "but
most players don't see those things. They don't see beyond the first
row. They just see within the lines of the court. I only look as far
as the baseline."</TE>
<TE>   But he and his teammates are also looking far ahead.</TE>
<TE>   To a four-peat.</TE>

<HD>Mercy Is Nets' Only Hope</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe David Stern can go to the 15-run rule, like they have in
softball beer leagues in the Midwest. The NBA needs a mercy clause,
some face-saving intervention, because this is getting pretty futile.</LD>
<LD>   I was kind of pulling for New Jersey to get a game. Keith Van Horn
played for me at Utah, and I feel for him. Plus, it would be nice to
get some validation for the East, if nothing else.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously, it's over. Nobody comes back from 3-0. The Nets pulled
out every stop, but they still struggled. Every score the Nets got
was an adventure. Right now, points for New Jersey are harder to get
than help for a blowout on the Santa Monica Freeway.</LD>
<TE>   New Jersey tried so hard. They played according to Hoyle. They did
all they could do, and it wasn't nearly enough. In the beginning,
they took it right at Shaquille O'Neal, and Todd McCullouch got a few
points. They pressed. They zoned. They selectively doubled Shaq. They
tried to run. They tried every bullet they had, and still ended up
wide of the target.</TE>
<TE>   They tried everything they could, but the Lakers defend so well
that even if they do make a defensive mistake, there is the Big
Eraser. You all saw the block on Jason Kidd at the end. You might
just as well try to shoot over Mt. Everest. If you are the Nets, and
you run something that finally beats the Laker perimeter defense, and
then, there he is, the Howitzer, exploding the ball back in your
face, you have to want to go join the French Foreign Legion.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets tried. Heaven knows they tried. They started out doing a
good job of putting a body against Shaq, of standing him up a little.
They took all their fouls. They zoned him a little, selectively
doubled him, even made him run up to cover some high picks on the
ball. But to no avail.</TE>
<TE>   They tried the whole arsenal and the Lakers barely flinched.</TE>
<TE>   Let's look at it this way.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers started the playoffs against one of the best-talent
teams in the NBA, Portland. Handled them.</TE>
<TE>   Next they played the best player in the league, at least according
to the MVP vote. Tim Duncan is a terrific player and San Antonio is a
very good team. Handled them.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the cowbells and the real NBA Finals. Sacramento is the
NBA's varsity fast-break team, and had a better record than the
Lakers and the home-court advantage that comes with that. Handled
them, too.</TE>
<TE>   So along comes New Jersey, and the sad truth is that all three of
the Laker playoff opponents prior to the Nets presented more of a
problem for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Laker fans understand how much the skills of some of the
other Lakers are lost in the nightly Shaq-Kobe show. It is hard to
see anything else in the glare of these two superstars.</TE>
<TE>   But Sunday night provided a good look at the defensive toughness
of Rick Fox and Derek Fisher and the great situational defense of
Robert Horry. Fox and Fisher are understated and underrated in the
defensive scheme of L.A., and Horry, who doesn't play quite as
physically tough as those two and doesn't pressure his man as much,
is still astute in his defensive assignments. He bothers you and he
is long. And they are all situational veterans. They've all been
through this now in June, and they know exactly what they are doing.</TE>
<TE>   For me, it was there from the start. I didn't like the looks in
the eyes of the Nets' players coming out of the opening huddle. It
wasn't that they were awestruck, but they seemed to be looking to
each other to buoy their confidence. It looked like a charade. There
was no swagger, no bravado.</TE>
<TE>   And soon, there will be no more NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Mercifully so.</TE>

<HD>Capturing Those Shining Moments</HD>
<DH>NBA Finals: Crews for NBA Entertainment go extra mile to
document everything they can.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Brent Musburger and Jack Ramsay are previewing Game 3 of the NBA
Finals, breaking down the matchups. Musburger stops and looks up for
approval.</LD>
<LD>   It's good. NBA Entertainment got it. There isn't much the six to
20 camera crews miss during the Finals.</LD>
<LD>   They're in the locker rooms, training rooms and team buses. By the
time the series is over, NBA Entertainment estimates it will have
shot 400,000 feet of videotape and 300,000 feet of film.</LD>
<TE>   "For us, historically documenting everything is the most important
thing we do," said Paul Hirschheimer, NBA Entertainment's vice
president for field production. "That's what we are. We're the
history of the NBA. If we don't get it here tonight, it's gone
forever. That's our job every day, but in the Finals it's magnified.
If you miss the moment of the series, if Shaquille comes with his
thunder dunk, it's gone forever. That's why we do everything we can."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, not all the footage can be used. And the nature of the
NBA Finals, with their sudden conclusion and necessity for a quick
turnaround time, means that they must prepare for both teams to win
the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Because the finished product includes footage shot throughout the
playoffs, the preparation and film-gathering begins in the early
rounds. That made this year tougher than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the balance of the East, you had no idea who the
Finals [teams] were going to be," Hirschheimer said. "Sometimes you
can make a guess that maybe the eight seed is not going to make it,
but not this year.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases, the team that doesn't win the title, we still do a
video yearbook on. It's not like we're wasting our efforts there.
That's what our people do for a living. It's not like a network where
they're focused on baseball, football. We're focused on this.</TE>
<TE>   "If we do something great with the Nets and they end up not
winning the title, or the Lakers [end up] not winning the title,
it'll be on 'Inside Stuff' next week or it'll be on NBA TV or it'll
be on 'NBA Action' or it'll be in the library. So if 25 years from
now someone wants to do something on Jason Kidd, we'll have it. We
don't worry about wasting. For us, everything is going to find its
way to something."</TE>
<TE>   Everything? There are the shots of players walking into the arena.
There are crews outside the arena and around the concourses capturing
the fans and atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant even smiled when he saw a sound man he recognized
because, as Bryant said, if he's around it must mean the Lakers are
in the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   So the Lakers aren't just trying to finish the three-peat. They're
trying to complete a film trilogy.</TE>

<KH>NET NOTES</KH>
<HD>Kidd Frustrated, Not Fatigued</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>More than one courtside observer noticed that point guard Jason Kidd
looked drained at times during Games 1 and 2 of the NBA Finals. He
pushed hard in both Net losses to the Lakers at Staples Center last
week and came away with nothing to show for his efforts.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Byron Scott said he believed Kidd's look of fatigue was, in
fact, simply frustration at the Nets' inability to play as they did
in earlier-round victories over the Boston Celtics, Charlotte Hornets
and Indiana Pacers.</LD>
<LD>   "Jason plays at 110% in every game," Scott said. "We need other
guys to join him. That's the bottom line. If we can get four or five
guys to play at the level that [Kidd] is so accustomed to playing,
like we've been playing all season long, we'll be fine. I don't think
he's tired at all. I think he's a little frustrated."</LD>
<TE>   Kidd had 23 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in 43 minutes in
Game 1. He added 17 points, nine rebounds and seven assists in 39
minutes in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kidd is widely acknowledged to be the driving force behind the
Nets' first run to the Finals. After all, he was runner-up to San
Antonio's Tim Duncan for most-valuable-player honors this season.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd also is eligible to opt out of his contract after next season
and become a free agent. Rod Thorn, New Jersey's general manager,
said last week he believes Kidd will return to the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, if we're a good team, I think he will [re-sign]," Thorn
told the New York Post. "If he thinks we're going to be a good team
and we'll play in these big games like we're playing this year, to
me, I think he'll come back and sign with us. We've made a pretty
good run here. He's been a big part of it, obviously. He's gone to
another level as a player since he's been with us."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets acquired Kidd last summer from the Phoenix Suns for point
guard Stephon Marbury. A number of teams around the league could be
high-stakes bidders for Kidd's services if he went on the free-agent
market. The Lakers and Clippers could be two teams in search of help
at the point.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only the Portland Trail Blazers, in 1977, and the Celtics, in
1969, have rallied to win a championship after trailing, 2-0, in the
Finals. The Trail Blazers did it against the Philadelphia 76ers and
the Celtics pulled it off against the Lakers. Only 12 teams in league
history have rallied from a 2-0 deficit to win any best-of-seven
series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Nets had two leads in Game 1, 2-0 and 4-2. They led for
roughly 60 seconds. They trailed from start to finish in Game 2.</TE>

<HD>MacCulloch Centers Blame on Self</HD>
<DH>Game 3: Nets' big man says his poor defense on O'Neal is
the main reason his team is down three games to Lakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Todd MacCulloch doesn't want your pity. Or your scorn. He's doing the
best he possibly can against Shaquille O'Neal, short of having him
whacked by one of Tony Soprano's henchmen. He knows it's not good
enough.</LD>
<LD>   An HBO screenwriter simply cannot write MacCulloch out of the mess
he and the New Jersey Nets are in against the bigger, stronger,
faster and more experienced O'Neal and the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Only the strong survive.</LD>
<TE>   That sacred tenant, in life and on the hardwood, was brutally
illustrated again in Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Sunday at
Continental Airlines Arena, where MacCulloch and the Nets swarmed
O'Neal with a new defensive strategy--a collapsing zone that had them
clinging to the Laker center like lint.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets gambled that the other Lakers couldn't defeat them from
the outside. They had seen enough of O'Neal's thunderous dunks, deft
jump shots and sweet jump hooks in Games 1 and 2. New Jersey Coach
Byron Scott determined that it was time for a different ploy.</TE>
<TE>   New game plan, same poor fellow attempting to put it to good use
for his beleaguered team.</TE>
<TE>   "Another bad game," MacCulloch said after the Nets' 106-103 loss
to the Lakers left them with a three-games-to-none deficit. "I didn't
do a good job on Shaq. I haven't played well the whole series."</TE>
<TE>   Said Scott: "We don't have anybody like Shaq. It's not only us,
but there are 28 other teams in the league who don't have anybody
like that. Anybody we put on him is a mismatch."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 35 points (on 12-for-19 shooting), took 11 rebounds
and blocked four shots, including a pivotal swat against a driving
Jason Kidd with 48 seconds left in the game. He also made 11 of 17
free throws. He wasn't as electrifying as when he scored 40 points
and took 12 rebounds and added eight assists Friday in Game 2. He
wasn't as forceful as in scoring 36 and taking 16 rebounds Wednesday
in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal was all but unstoppable, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I did a pretty bad job defending Shaq," MacCulloch
said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he's correct in his harsh self-evaluation, particularly
when you consider that O'Neal scored 40 points and took 12 rebounds
in the only regular-season game he played against MacCulloch this
season.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Collins, MacCulloch's backup, doesn't agree, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at how Shaq has played against everybody else in his career
in the Finals," said Collins, a rookie from Stanford. "It's not like
other guys have had any better luck against him. He's going to make
his shots, but you've got to make it tough on him."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets made the Lakers uncomfortable for long stretches of Game
3, playing their most aggressive defense against O'Neal in the
series. Most of that was a result of ditching their foolhardy solo
coverage against O'Neal in favor of the zone.</TE>
<TE>   MacCulloch caused O'Neal problems by being forceful with the
basketball in the first half. Instead of settling for setting picks
and picking up an occasional offensive rebound, MacCulloch attacked
the hoop and scored 10 points on four-for-seven shooting in nine
minutes in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott decided against playing MacCulloch as much in the second
half, putting a quicker team on the floor--the better to pressure the
Lakers all over the court. The Nets surged to a seven-point lead in
the fourth quarter. But the Lakers steadied themselves and rallied
for their third victory over the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   By game's end, Collins would play 27 minutes to only 14 for
MacCulloch. Collins would miss all four of his shots and take only
three rebounds compared to MacCulloch's four-for-eight shooting and
one rebound.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, Collins figured the Nets' twin 7-foot centers had one
thing in common: an ugly collection of bumps and bruises suffered in
tangling with the 7-foot-1, 335-pound O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what, if anything, he could compare to guarding O'Neal,
Collins said, without hesitation, "I would say it's like playing in a
football game and going up against a big, physical lineman. At the
end of the game, you're definitely tired."</TE>
<TE>   Tired, deflated, defeated.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Is Showing His Flex Appeal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>

<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The biceps wasn't the size of a barrel. There were no super hero
tattoos. It was not scratched from the rim, or bruised from a nose,
or even dripping with sweat.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant showed it just the same. Flexed it and pointed to it
and smothered the New Jersey Nets with it.</LD>
<LD>   On a night, not coincidentally, when Shaquille O'Neal could not.</LD>
<TE>   You don't think there's still competition between the two best
players in the NBA?</TE>
<TE>   You think that just because they're buddies means they're no
longer rivals?</TE>
<TE>   Most in the basketball world Sunday thought they were watching the
Lakers escape the desperate clutches of the Nets in a 106-103 victory
to take a three-games-to-none lead in the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Laker followers, however, knew that they were watching a
playground game of H-O-R-S-E.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's exaggerated flex as he came to the bench after his
off-balance, win-clinching runner was as much about O'Neal as it was
about the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal had dominated the first two games of this series.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant felt it was his turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Game time!" he barked at his teammates during the juiced-up final
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   A Springsteen-singing, Sopranos-cheering crowd of 19,215 at
Continental Airlines Arena was stunned by it.</TE>
<TE>   A reborn New Jersey team was buried in it.</TE>
<TE>   The first two battles between the Lakers and Nets were nothing
compared to a third game that revealed the larger, albeit friendly,
duel between Kobe and Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely," Rick Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   "Subconsciously, yeah," said Brian Shaw. "That's the way it always
is."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant just smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq is a Goliath," he said. "I was just playing off him."</TE>
<TE>   And playing off the rest of us, who have watched this for six
years and know better.</TE>
<TE>   It is a little-known but well-supported statistic that when O'Neal
comes out of a game, Bryant nearly always takes the next shot.</TE>
<TE>   And so it was in the fourth quarter Sunday that when O'Neal was
taken out of his game with double and triple-teaming, Bryant made the
next bunches of shots.</TE>
<TE>   A turnaround jumper here. A driving-past-the-entire-state layup
there.</TE>
<TE>   With the Lakers trailing by a handful of points with six minutes
left, he made a slithering runner between two defenders.</TE>
<TE>   With the Lakers leading by two, he dribbled behind his back before
nailing a fadeaway jumper with Kenyon Martin's giant hand swinging at
his face.</TE>
<TE>   Then, finally, he clinched the win by muscling the ball from Jason
Kidd and Kerry Kittles and hitting a right-handed runner while
leaping between them.</TE>
<TE>   That's H-O-R-S-E, right?</TE>
<TE>   That was also the shot that encouraged Bryant to strut to the
Laker bench flexing his right biceps and pointing to that biceps like
a Mr. Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   Well, OK, Mr. Junior Olympian.</TE>
<TE>   To which Phil Jackson responded with an odd stare.</TE>
<TE>   "He was looking at me in amazement because he didn't know I had
these big, good guns," Bryant said, smiling. "Just so strong with the
ball, I was like number 34 out there."</TE>
<TE>   Of course he was. That was the point.</TE>
<TE>   After watching O'Neal behave as the Finals MVP for the first two
games, Bryant put his name on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   After being the Lakers best player for the first three rounds,
Bryant thought it was time for a reminder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same for both of them," Shaw said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can just see it."</TE>
<TE>   Remember when this used to be a bad thing? Back before the two
guys figured that they needed each other more than they needed the
bickering? Back when the Lakers were swept out of series, instead of
being on the verge of sweeping the biggest of them all?</TE>
<TE>   Today, maturity has turned it into a splendid thing. It's about a
competition that no longer burdens this team, but lifts it up.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's there, Kobe even says it's there," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   He says it?</TE>
<TE>   "He says it to me," Fox said. "Said it to me tonight."</TE>
<TE>   What did he say?</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Give me the ball, give me the ball,' " Fox repeated.
"He said it about six times. I hate going out of the offense but I
just had to give him the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant explained it in different words.</TE>
<TE>   "They collapse on [Shaq] and make it hard for him to breathe down
there, then that's when I take over," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant used to blanche at that role, as if it made him a glorified
role player.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, realizing the jewelry that can be obtained with that
role, he relishes it.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last couple of years, they blended their talents together
very well," Jackson said. "I think it was Kobe's ability to grow up,
to adjust, to accommodate Shaq's extending his hand out to Kobe ... "</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, that hand was in search of a rescue, In every way,
Bryant was big enough.</TE>

<LD>In a postseason of firsts, Rick Fox and actress-singer wife Vanessa
Williams enjoyed another landmark this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time they had seen each other since before the
playoffs began, a span of more than two months.</LD>
<LD>   While Fox was helping the Lakers reach the NBA Finals, Williams
was leading her Broadway show, "Into the Woods," to the Tony Awards.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, when Fox was playing in Sacramento in Game 7, Williams
was in the audience at the Tonys in New York, waiting to see if she
had won for her portrayal of a witch. The Lakers won, she didn't, but
both of them won when the Nets beat the Boston Celtics in the Eastern
Conference finals, allowing them to see each other in the Finals.</TE>

<LD>You might think that after playing so many extra games over the last
three seasons--23 playoff games two years ago, 16 last year and 18
this year--the Lakers should be near the breaking point in terms of
wear and tear.</LD>
<LD>   That's 57 more games, for instance, than the Clippers have played
over the same period, and, more to the point, 38 more than the New
Jersey Nets.</LD>
<LD>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson, whose team is trying to win its third
consecutive NBA championship, said last week that the third title is
the most difficult--in part because of the physical demands on the
players.</LD>
<TE>   "You're dealing with players that are playing 100-plus games a
season," Jackson said. "That's a difficult task. It's a difficult
task because the in-between periods get shorter and shorter to
recuperate, come back and play."</TE>
<TE>   But Robert Huizenga, a former Raider team doctor, is skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think your body, your muscles, in terms of fatigue or
damage, remember what you did last June, compared to, let's say, the
Nets, who didn't play any extra games last year," Huizenga said.
"From an exercise physiology point, I don't think that [argument]
goes anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "If one team didn't play much the month before, or two months
before, we could have something to talk about. But not from a year
ago."</TE>

<LD>Last Friday's game was the 96th pro basketball game played at Staples
Center since the exhibition season began-- and potentially the last
if the NBA Finals ends in New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   After all this time, it's anything but routine.</LD>
<LD>   Britney Spears played concerts Tuesday and Thursday nights, and in
between was Wednesday's opening game of the Finals.</LD>
<TE>   That meant her elaborate stage--which filled 18 trucks--had to be
taken down and reassembled, then packed up again. Staples Center
workers finished the transition back to the basketball setup at 7
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Just because the Lakers headed East doesn't mean it will be a slow
week at Staples. There was an Avengers Arena football game Saturday
and there's a Sparks WNBA game Tuesday. And the arena is in operation
for "Home Court Advantage" when the Laker games in New Jersey are
shown on the giant screens at Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>You Need to Be a Soprano to Understand These Fans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>I took a vow, somewhere on the drive between Tony Soprano's Bada-Bing
Club on Rt. 17 in nearby Lodi, and the Meadowlands where Chris and
Pussy exhumed the body of a garbage hauler they had buried, to be
nicer here to people than maybe I am to folks back in L.A.</LD>
<LD>   In fact I would urge Kevin Brown, Tim Leiweke and the Grocery
Store Bagger to move to Jersey as soon as possible and I can say
without reservation, I'd be nicer to them all. I'll even pay for the
Bagger's one-way airfare.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   I ARRIVED officially as Mr. Nice Guy at the Continental Airlines
Arena at 11:30 a.m., nine hours before game time, and already found
some idiots tail-gating atop the toxic landfill they call the
Meadowlands.</TE>
<TE>   I told Bill Pawelko, who had set up four easy chairs and a
barbecue "to get a life," and then introduced myself as Bill Plaschke
in case Pawelko was related to Paulie Walnuts. Pawelko gave me this
sob story about being a long-suffering Nets' fan, so I guess he
believed me when I told him I was Plaschke.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait until you hear the fans cheering 'N-E-T-S, Nets, Nets,
Nets,' " said Steve Pawelko, Bill's brother. "It's just like the
'J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets' cheer."</TE>
<TE>   I said, "I've never seen a group of people so intent on proving to
everyone else in the country they know how to spell," and then
spelled out my name for them: "P-L-A-S-C-H-K-E, Plaschke, Plaschke,
Plaschke."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NETS failed to sell out several playoff games, and opened the
season before a crowd of 8,749. With so many people in New Jersey
getting whacked, that's understandable. By November, there were only
5,234 here for a game with the Bulls.</TE>
<TE>   There is talk the Nets will move to a new arena in downtown
Newark, and Steve Pawelko wanted me to know Shaquille O'Neal has
bought a bunch of land around the proposed Newark site.</TE>
<TE>   I guess he has gotten Uncle Junior's blessing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS no line and no one stepping forward to have their faces
painted for free before the game. On my trip to Sacramento, the line
stretched as long as a football field. I didn't find that odd. The
only reason to live in Sacramento is if you're in the Witness
Protection Program, and painting your face to change your identity is
an everyday thing.</TE>
<TE>   I ran into four bruisers, Arman Sarkisyan, his brother Robert,
Greg Grigorian and some guy who insisted that I call him, "Freddy
Krueger."</TE>
<TE>   I asked them if they could tell me what it was like to be a Nets'
fan, and one by one they identified themselves as a Clipper fan, a
Laker fan, a Yankee fan and Freddy Krueger, and that was his story
and he was sticking to it.</TE>
<TE>   Right now I wouldn't want to admit I'm a Nets' fan either.</TE>
<TE>   I'd suspect a number of Nets' fans are trying to get a hold of Dr.
Melfi; they'll probably have to wait in line behind David Stern and
NBC executives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MISS LIBERTY, Sondra Fortunato, told me the Nets had paid her to
come to the game with a crown on her head, dressed in a flowing red
gown two sizes too small in some places, and to just walk around.
Fortunato, who appeared in "Smokey and the Bandit," a few decades
ago, had a picture of her and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar pinned to her
dress, and when she leaned over to give me a better look, I was
worried she might just keep falling and smother me. That's something
you'd see on "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   "I just won the Miss Liberty contest in Jersey City; it was a very
challenging contest," she said, and in my new capacity as Mr. Nice
Guy I think I said something really sweet like, "What a great way to
celebrate your 50th birthday."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE CROWD that waded through garbage outside the Arena can be best
described as grungy. In fact, everyone looked right at home. If looks
mean anything, you needed four things to get inside: a ticket, a big
belly, tattoo and an attitude.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want anyone to misunderstand, though. When Tony iced the
guy at the Meadowlands Parkway off Rt. 3 in Secaucus it was because
the guy was a hit man who was coming after him.</TE>
<TE>   I want to make it clear here that I'm not going after anyone other
than Salma Hayek.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A LOCAL newspaper said negotiations were ongoing to have Bruce
Springsteen sing the National Anthem on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it was Ron Rains from "The Guiding Light."</TE>
<TE>   And to think I was here to hear it.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd was urged on by the scoreboard with the "New York Post
Noise Reader." It was about as accurate as most of the stories in the
Post.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody dressed from head to foot with the name, "Sly Fox" and
the number "1" on his back tried to incite the crowd. For awhile, I
thought he was the only celebrity in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Come on, I can't be blamed for not seeing Danny Devito. Billy
Crystal, Chris Rock and Phil Mickelson were also here.</TE>
<TE>   I have no idea who Mickelson was betting on.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WITH 2:13 to play, and the Lakers in position to win again, the
folks who run the arena decided to put some real heat on L.A.</TE>
<TE>   On the overhead scoreboard, they showed a stirring scene from "The
Sopranos," a reminder to the Lakers that folks around here have a way
of dealing with people who cause problems. A minute later Shaq was
laying on the floor and writhing in pain after having his legs cut
out from under him.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers went on to win, and we'll all be back here Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Won't we?</TE>

<HD>Walton Delivers the Jabs, O'Neal the Knockout</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Walton was right when he said the Lakers, who had a foul to
give, should not have let Jason Kidd have such an open shot to tie
the game at the end.</LD>
<LD>   NBC partner Steve "Snapper" Jones made an astute observation a
little earlier when he said the Lakers "know how to close out
opponents and they know how to break their hearts."</LD>
<LD>   But the line of the night during NBC's coverage of Game 3 of the
NBA Finals came from none other than Shaquille O'Neal. And it scored
a direct hit.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Gray, who was in Memphis Saturday night conducting post-fight
interviews after Lennox Lewis' knockout of Mike Tyson on pay-per-view
TV, conducted postgame interviews Sunday night for NBC, first with
Kobe Bryant, then O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "They were smacking you around like Lennox Lewis smacked around
Mike," Gray commented to O'Neal, which momentarily turned Shaq into a
boxing commentator--and a defender of Tyson. The Laker center called
it a great fight and said there should be a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   After a few more questions, O'Neal delivered his knockout punch.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike should have knocked you out last night," he told Gray as he
walked off.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBC is now only one Laker victory from saying goodbye to the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   It figures to be a syrupy farewell, filled with chest-thumping and
back-slapping and all kinds of self-congratulation.</TE>
<TE>   Some of it may be warranted--NBC has had a pretty good 12-year run
with the NBA--but you can almost count on the network going
overboard.</TE>
<TE>   But then, at the other end of the spectrum, is the way NBC said
goodbye to Ahmad Rashad Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   There was no farewell at all. Worse yet, he was cut off in
mid-sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Rashad had told The Times earlier that he would be ending his
20-year run on NBC with Sunday night's pregame show. A feature in
which he interviewed Shaq and Kobe would be his last assignment for
the network.</TE>
<TE>   He and Hannah Storm were replaced by Bob Costas as host of the
pregame show for the Finals, and Rashad declined to join Storm on the
postgame show carried by CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   After his piece Sunday night and after saying O'Neal had told him
he wants to play 10 more years, Rashad started to say, "I talked to
Jason Kidd ... "</TE>
<TE>   But suddenly Costas interrupted. "All right, more to come from the
Meadowlands."</TE>
<TE>   Rashad could only look sheepishly into the camera.</TE>
<TE>   It was time for another commercial break, and apparently NBC
couldn't wait long enough to at least let Rashad complete his final
sentence for the network, let alone give him a brief send-off, or a
thank you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you were watching Channel 4 news Sunday afternoon, the anchors
kept talking about the game starting at 5 p.m. But that's when the
NBC pregame show started. The game wasn't scheduled to start until
5:30.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the anchors were simply misinformed, but this had the smell
of an old television trick--misrepresent to the viewers in order to
drive up the ratings for the pregame show. And NBC has pulled this
old con many times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Game 2 Friday night got a respectable 27.8 television rating
with a 46 share in Los Angeles, it got only a 10.2/17 in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The national overnight rating was a 10.3 with an 18 share, which
is 29% below the 14.5/26 overnight numbers for Game 2 last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Walton thrives on making profound comments, many of which rub
viewers the wrong way. It didn't take him long to deliver one. This
one came right before the tipoff:</TE>
<TE>   "The lack of opposition from New Jersey has been quite appalling.
They have to wake up and do it quickly, otherwise the only challenge
for Los Angeles is going to be the standard of historical
excellence."</TE>
<TE>   You figure it out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Marv Albert reported that Shaq, who spent his preteen years
in Newark, N.J., had purchased 62 tickets for friends and relatives
at a cost of about $10,000, Walton wondered how he had done that.</TE>
<TE>   "How did he get the money?" Walton said.</TE>
<TE>   Surely he was kidding.</TE>
<TE>   What Jones wanted to know was: "How did he get the tickets?"</TE>
<TE>   That was a legitimate question. Sixty-two tickets is a lot for
anyone, even O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Costas succeeded in getting one of the more revealing interviews
with Phil Jackson you'll hear. It aired in two parts--before the game
and at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Jerry West had written to him about possibly joining
him in Memphis, but Jackson said the Lakers will be the last team he
coaches. He said enduring all the losses while trying to build a team
would be too tough.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about Red Auerbach, Jackson was fairly soft on him.
Auerbach said recently that Jackson has never had to build a team--he
always has been handed teams with superstars.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson somewhat agreed with that comment, saying what he does
best is teach a team how to run an offense.</TE>
<TE>   But he did say he didn't like it when Auerbach used to "light up a
stogie in the fourth quarter." Jackson called it "that in-your-face
activity."</TE>
<TE>   After Costas told Jackson that some people think he comes off as
arrogant, Jackson said he could understand that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shy," he said. "I'm not one to work a room and talk to
everyone. When you've had some success, that can be viewed as
arrogance."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since the All-Star break, Jackson has been doing a weekly national
Sporting News network radio show, heard in Los Angeles on KMPC
(1540). It's on every Monday, 3-4 p.m., with Chris Myers as co-host.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is contracted to continue doing the show through June 24.</TE>
<TE>   Last week on the show Jackson talked about Auerbach.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what his record was without Bill Russell there. Every
coach has to have great players. [But] that's not what it's all
about. It's about five people playing together, it's about getting a
team to play, and getting a star to play around your system."</TE>
<TE>   Using that criteria, it's pretty hard to knock Jackson.</TE>

<LD>Lakers Take Away Remaining Drama</LD>
<LD>   In a weekend of intensely anticipated sporting events that proved
to be frustrating anticlimaxes, the New Jersey Nets' excruciating
106-103 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday was the final coup
de disgrace.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, now within one game of a third consecutive NBA title,
are all that. In fact, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, who had 36
and 35 points, respectively, are even more. They're all this and all
that. But for one night on their home court, the Nets were almost as
good.</LD>
<TE>   Jason Kidd was everywhere with 30 points and 10 assists.
Spider-Man couldn't cover more territory. Kenyon Martin awoke,
scoring 26 points. In effect, Game 3 was virtually an elimination
game. And the Nets played with a desperate fury worthy of it. After
all, no team in the history of the NBA has come back from a 3-0
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, behind 94-87, simply made every play they needed down
the stretch in an imperiously efficient 19-9 closing push. O'Neal
made enough free throws (11 of 17), plus an acrobatic block of a Kidd
layup in the last minute. No shot, even when double-teamed, was
beyond Bryant's plastic-man ability to stretch himself inches beyond
the leap of his foes.</TE>
<TE>   "The light is starting to flicker a little bit. Their two stars
stepped it up big time," Net Coach Byron Scott admitted. "There are
28 other teams that don't have anybody to stop them either."</TE>
<TE>   Then Scott really summed up this now-defunct series. "Shaq is just
a freak of nature," said Scott, who has watched O'Neal score 111
points in three games as he heads for his third straight most
valuable player award in the NBA Finals. "You'd have to get Mr.
O'Neal and Mrs. O'Neal together again to come up with somebody to
stop Shaq."</TE>

<TE>   Their Best Still Not Good Enough</TE>
<TE>   At last, at the end, there were no excuses to fall in line behind,
no sacrificial scapegoats to absorb all the slings and all the arrows
of poor effort and lousy execution. That, it turned out, was the most
helpless, hopeless, hapless feeling of all.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets played a terrific basketball game Sunday night. They shot
the ball well, nearly 52% for the game. They ran the ball well. They
got wonderful efforts from their two stars, Jason Kidd and Kenyon
Martin, who had 56 points between them. They even managed to score 14
more points in the paint than the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   They had their shoe heels poised on the Lakers' fingertips</TE>
<TE>   And it still wasn't good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Helpless. Hopeless. Hapless.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a relentless team," Martin would say through a sigh and
a set of shrugged shoulders. "And they are also a talented team. It's
why they've won two championships in a row."</TE>
<TE>   Forget the formalities and let's call it three, because the Lakers
aren't just a great team, they are a greedy one. They won Sunday's
game, 106-103, when it would have been perfectly acceptable to save
themselves for Wednesday night. They took a 3-0 lead in this series
when 2-1 would have been just as daunting.</TE>
<TE>   They win even when they're not supposed to win.</TE>
<TE>   Which is what makes them so frightening.</TE>
<TE>   And makes this series so over.</TE>
<TE>   The luster of this splendid season has already been scratched and
scuffed for the Nets; their lone aspiration across the next three
days is to keep the Lakers from dulling its memory entirely with the
business end of a broom.</TE>
<TE>   Professionals aren't supposed to play for pride, and they aren't
supposed to be trolling for moral victories.</TE>
<TE>   But without pride, without a consolation prize or two, what do the
Nets have left, exactly?</TE>

<TE>   Home Isn't Much of an Advantage</TE>
<TE>   Back when no one cared about the Nets, which seems like yesterday,
the organization pulled a hi-tech hoax. The Nets couldn't cause a
commotion, so they created one. In a desperate effort to breathe life
into a building and a team, they manufactured crowd noise over the
loudspeakers. There were whistles, applause and lots of love.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, the Nets faked it more than anyone on "Sex in the
City." In yet another example of how far they've come, there was real
human emotion at Continental Airlines Arena on Sunday night. Though
the cheering and the passion was all natural, it didn't exactly pound
off the walls as hard as Shaq is pounding the Nets. Even after a very
long and tough week in L.A., the Nets returned to a civil and
somewhat suspicious building. You think the players didn't notice?
After the Game 3 player introductions, Kenyon Martin had to tug at
his ear and wave his hands to give fans the cue to be heard. Then
came a plea from the public-address announcer: "Get on your feet. You
are the sixth man." And Lucious Harris thought he had that role all
to himself.</TE>
<TE>   As the NBA Finals came to a critical crossroads for the Nets, they
really had no choice. Home court either had to be an advantage, or
serve as the dance floor for the Lakers' three-peat celebration.</TE>
<TE>   At least the Nets went into the game knowing they had the majority
of the house. The games are all sold out now, but this was hardly a
simple process. You could rub two sticks together and they would warm
up faster than North Jersey did for the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   Lest anyone forgot, the team that's representing the East in the
championship round drew 8,749 fans for its regular-season home
opener.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the playoffs guaranteed the Nets a full house; they
couldn't sell out their postseason opener against the Pacers. But the
news spread faster than the Nets made their way through the
conference, and there they were Sunday night, trying to give the
bandwagon a reason to keep rolling.</TE>

<TE>   View Isn't Pretty for Nets Anymore</TE>
<TE>   And they thought the view of the New Jersey turnpike from the
Meadowlands was bad.</TE>
<TE>   Check the view of the rest of the NBA season for the Nets.</TE>
<TE>   No team has ever won the championship after failing to win in the
first three games. The Laker victory was a record seventh consecutive
in the Finals.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets tried to get local hero Bruce Springsteen to sing the
national anthem. But what the Nets found instead was another familiar
face, Shaquille O'Neal, playing his own version of glory days.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets hit their first four shots, but the Lakers repeated the
familiar theme in this series and surged behind O'Neal to a 13-point
first-quarter lead. The Lakers then looked like they'd pull away,
opening the second quarter scoring seven of the first nine points for
a 38-25 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Before Kobe Bryant had a chance to go to work in the fourth
quarter, Jason Kidd led the Nets back into a lead, putting them up
92-85 after a Kenyon Martin hook shot with just over eight minutes
left. It gave the Nets hope. But there was too much game left.</TE>
<TE>   "It's game time," Bryant kept exorting the Lakers in the huddle
before scoring 12 in the fourth quarter. "We're not going to let them
take it from us."</TE>

<LD>Kobe Bryant, top, shows his Laker teammates where he thinks he was
fouled on his last basket. There was no call on the play, which
didn't much matter, in large part because of the dominating presence
of Shaquille O'Neal, left. Net fans tried using a giant brick to
intimidate O'Neal, above, but his play kept the Nets, despite the
brilliance of Jason Kidd, below, in the shadows.</LD>
