Camps, By Michael Thad Allen, University of North Carolina, Press:

<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BREITMAN</AU>
<BD>Richard Breitman is the author of "The Architect of
Genocide: Himmler and the Final Solution" and "Official Secrets: What
the Nazis Planned, What the British and Americans Knew."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The gas chambers and crematories at Auschwitz-Birkenau annihilated
thousands of Jews each day, creating the haunting specter of modern
technology harnessed to the goal of genocide. But before that,
high-ranking Nazi officials meticulously organized mass shootings of
hundreds of thousands of Jews (and some other groups). Even after the
establishment of extermination camps, shooting continued where it was
the more efficient method in Poland and in conquered areas of the
Soviet Union. If the gas chambers had never existed (or if they had
been destroyed by Allied bombs late in the war), Nazi Germany still
would have tried to carry out a "Final Solution of the Jewish
question" through other means.</LD>
<LD>   To explain how large numbers of people became mass murderers,
Pulitzer Prize-winning author Richard Rhodes cites both the
ideological motivation of Nazi leaders and the socialization of
leaders and followers to use violence. Drawing heavily from the
testimony of perpetrators brought to trial and from survivors and
witnesses of the mass shootings, Rhodes supplies a vivid account in
"Masters of Death" of this first stage of the Holocaust.</LD>
<TE>   Rhodes correctly contends that the techniques to carry out the
mass murder of an entire people had to be invented.Once the Nazi
leadership decided to eliminate what it perceived as a mortal threat
from the Jewish "race," they were in uncharted territory. There was
no precedent for eliminating a population that they estimated at more
than 11 million across Europe (the number used at the 1942 Wannsee
Conference). The Nazi regime became more and more firmly committed to
genocide of the Jews and to the decimation of other populations in a
vast new Eastern empire to be settled by Germans. Officials explored
different ways of carrying out their barbaric objectives.</TE>
<TE>   The Einsatzgruppen were battalion-size units formed by the
Security Police and SS Security Service, known as the SD, which
liquidated thousands of Poles and Jews in the fall of 1939. Heinrich
Himmler, head of the SS and chief of the German Police, and Reinhard
Heydrich, commander of the Security Police and SD, decided to employ
Einsatzgruppen on a much larger scale during the German invasion of
the Soviet Union. Jews and Communist officials were their main
targets.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, historians gave four Einsatzgruppen (about 3,000 men)
"credit" for killing more than 700,000 Jews, basing their findings
partly on summaries of the killing operations prepared in Gestapo
headquarters in Berlin. (These reports were uncovered after the war
and were used to help convict a group of Einsatzgruppen officers in a
U.S. trial that Rhodes covers briefly in an epilogue.)</TE>
<TE>   But through painstaking archival research, historians have
discovered that the Einsatzgruppen were but one component of the Nazi
shooting apparatus. Battalions of the Order Police, selected
regiments of the SS army and units of Ukrainian and other non-German
police all played substantial roles as executioners in the East.
Their combined manpower considerably exceeded that of the
Einsatzgruppen. Himmler also employed key regional commanders in the
war against the Jews in the East. The first stage of the Holocaust
was a multifaceted operation with different components.</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes does not limit himself to the Einsatzgruppen, but there
remains a need for a more detailed comparison of the composition and
behavior of the various units involved in the mass shootings.</TE>
<TE>   High Nazi officials feared the adverse psychological effects of
mass shootings on the executioners. Rhodes notes that Himmler was
sensitive to this problem--he blanched when he witnessed a mid-August
1941 execution of Jews at Minsk. The SS and police regional commander
for Central Russia, Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, quickly urged more
consideration for the welfare of his men. (Bach-Zelewski later
suffered a breakdown.) The sequence of events suggests that
Bach-Zelewski's complaint to Himmler initiated a period of
experimentation with alternative methods of killing, including poison
gas in mobile vans.</TE>
<TE>   A separate Nazi program to rid Germany of those deemed genetically
defective--the mentally and physically disabled--was by 1940 already
gassing tens of thousands with carbon monoxide. Eventually,
extermination camps that would use carbon monoxide were constructed
in areas that are today in Poland and were used to kill Jews who had
been transported there. Officials at Auschwitz-Birkenau also tested
the insecticide Zyklon-B, which led to even more lethal facilities
combining the gas chamber and crematorium.</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes draws upon work done in the 1990s by American criminologist
Lonnie Athens to explain how people are socialized to use violence:
First, they are brutalized; then they become belligerent. They begin
to exhibit violence to defend themselves against perceived threats
and then they become "virulent."</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes believes that a form of this model also explains how
policemen and SS men became the violent instruments of Nazi policy,
although it requires him to make broad generalizations such as:
"Certainly brutalization was the common lot of most children in
Germany at the beginning of the twentieth century." But what is the
evidence that child-rearing in Germany was more brutal than, for
example, in Russia or Austria-Hungary in that era? If such
differences were minimal, how does such brutalization help explain
the Holocaust?</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes also draws on research by political scientist Michael Mann
to demonstrate that a sample of nearly 1,600 Nazi perpetrators shows
a high percentage were people who had previously been part of extreme
political movements that tended to use violence. Mann's important
work is in some tension with detailed research by Holocaust historian
Christopher Browning about the composition of one police battalion.</TE>
<TE>   Mann's sample of perpetrators brought into trial proceedings may
or may not reflect the much larger population of untried
perpetrators. Rhodes, however, essentially agrees with Browning that
there were several types among executioners: eager and enthusiastic
killers, those who followed orders and a small minority who declined
to participate or soon sought to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   Rhodes adopts the now common, but not universal, view that Hitler
first decided to liquidate Jews in the East, then made a later
decision to reach across the entire continent for all European Jews.
His account of Nazi decision-making blends the work of scholars with
different and sometimes incompatible views about the timing of key
Nazi decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Readers are given little hint of interpretive disagreements. In
addition, Rhodes pays little attention to the latest trend among
historians that local and regional officials sometimes influenced
central decisions.</TE>
<TE>   In his well-researched book, "The Business of Genocide: The SS,
Slave Labor, and the Concentration Camps," historian Michael Thad
Allen finds that another type of perpetrator, engineers who worked
for the SS, shared a positive belief in German racial supremacy,
negative stereotypes of other "races," especially Jews and sweeping
aspirations to rebuild the world according to "German will" and
without moral restraints.</TE>
<TE>   This group of technocratic "visionaries" does not fit the model
Rhodes uses: They did not need a long-term pattern of socialization
into violence to work slave laborers to death. Granted, these SS
engineers (even some who worked on the construction of gas chambers)
were more removed from their victims than the Einsatzgruppen.</TE>
<TE>   The Einsatzgruppen were indoctrinated about the menace Jews
supposedly posed to Germany shortly before they began their grisly
work. Mass murder was given legitimacy, sometimes with the claim that
Hitler himself had authorized the policy. Unconditional obedience to
orders, without regard to traditional morality, was a cardinal
principle of the SS, and few policemen in Nazi Germany, whether they
belonged to the SS or the Nazi Party or not, were accustomed to
defying orders.</TE>
<TE>   When they received orders to kill--even to kill women and
children--there were more than enough willing executioners.
Repetition desensitized them more often than it caused them to refuse
an order or to break down emotionally.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no clear evidence that the SS engineers or the
Einsatzgruppen required long-term pattern of socialization to
violence, Rhodes' and Allen's works should contribute to better
understanding of Nazi Germany and its crimes. They also remind us
that the potential for genocide depends more on motivation and
organization than on the level of technology.</TE>
<TE>   Ask the Rwandans.</TE>

<DH>BAD BOY BRAWLY BROWN: A Novel, By Walter Mosley, Little,
Brown: 312 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>
<BD>Thomas Curwen is the deputy editor of Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few sequences in modern crime fiction are as breathtaking and
poignant as the final moments of Walter Mosley's 1996 novel, "A
Little Yellow Dog," when Mosley's hero, Easy Rawlins, and Raymond
"Mouse" Alexander, his partner of some 20 years, are ambushed in a
blind alley in South-Central Los Angeles. With a few deft strokes,
Mosley brings the world to its knees.</LD>
<LD>   It's 1963. JFK's just been assassinated, Los Angeles has come of
age and, in a hail of gunfire, Easy and Mouse find themselves
fighting for their lives. It's a familiar moment, only this time
everything goes wrong. Mouse gets hit, and in their escape, Easy
watches his best friend slip away. Is it any wonder Mosley took six
years--and six other novels--before telling us what happens next?
Some things you just don't walk away from.</LD>
<LD>   The much-anticipated sequel to "Yellow Dog" and the latest in his
bestselling series of Easy Rawlins novels, "Bad Boy Brawly Brown"
opens less than a year later. Little has changed in Easy's life. He's
still holding onto his house in West L.A. and his job as custodian at
the junior high. His girlfriend, Bonnie Shay, has moved in. The kids,
Feather and Jesus, are there, as well as that mean yellow mongrel he
took in a year ago. It's a domestic scene that Mosley works to
perfection, but something's not quite right.</LD>
<TE>   Early one morning, Mosley catches Easy looking out the living room
window. "Red sunlight glinted through the ragged palms at the end of
our block. I had never wept over Raymond's demise, but that tattered
light reflected a pain deep in my mind." Fewer words have ever said
more.</TE>
<TE>   Easy's a haunted man, and Mosley plays it just right, letting the
pain stay, then drift aside, so that when the phone rings--a friend
asking Easy to help look for his girl's son, a young man by the name
of Brawly--the world effortlessly opens up. Let James Ellroy, Robert
Crais and other urban crime writers grab their characters by the
throat. Mosley succeeds with finesse.</TE>
<TE>   Brawly's in trouble, but then he always has been: from the time
his parents broke up when he was a child to when his mother had her
nervous breakdown; from the time his father started beating him to
when his cousin seduced him. And now he's hooked up with a black
radical group, the First Men. Their goal is unclear. The police think
it's violent unrest and vow to smash them. The First Men claim it's
education. The truth probably lies somewhere between the group's
manifesto, which calls for a school and a community center, and a
cache of weapons, stored under Brawly's bed.</TE>
<TE>   It's a classic formula: the troubled detective called upon for a
favor that he has reservations about. "You know yourself it's better
not even to look for'im," Easy warns Brawly's stepfather, the man who
placed the call. "Either he's gonna outgrow it or it's gonna row him
under. That's the way it is for all young black men."</TE>
<TE>   As always, though, the case gets under his skin. Searching for
Brawly soon becomes a balm to his own grief, and before Easy knows
it, there's no backing out. Juggling his relationship with his
family, drifting in and out of their lives with some success and some
difficulty, he discovers something at stake in finding this young
man, something he's not immediately sure of.</TE>
<TE>   The formula ends here, broken by Easy himself, a man whose
intelligence, contradictions and raw sensuality can't be predicted, a
man who perfectly serves Mosley's ambition to create an ongoing
picture of the black community in Los Angeles during the postwar
years. We've come a long way from Houston, where Easy and Mouse
started running together in the late '30s, and from Central Avenue in
1948, where Mosley set his debut, "Devil in a Blue Dress." The
streets are angrier and the expectations more pronounced. Just months
earlier, three civil rights workers were murdered in Mississippi; a
year before, Birmingham exploded.</TE>
<TE>   Only Mosley's game isn't to capture the fire, at least not yet.
His is a more complicated and nuanced story of black men and women
coming to grips with what they want, with what they deserve and how
much they can put up with. The volatile years of the civil rights
movement are merely a backdrop to a struggle between the pragmatism
of an older generation and the restless impatience of its children.</TE>
<TE>   "Older black folks is just scared'a what groups like the First Men
stand for," Brawly's girlfriend defiantly tells Easy. "They're scared
to stand up and demand what the white man owes them. They just don't
understand that the only way to get somethin' is to fight for it."</TE>
<TE>   At 44, nearly twice the age of Brawly, Easy sees it from
both sides. Los Angeles--for its racist edge--is nothing compared
with where he grew up in Texas where "any poor black child ... was
lucky if he lived to make it to bed that night." But Easy knows just
getting through a day isn't enough. As one of the leaders of the
First Men, Xavier Bodan, says, "If we don't do anything ... then the
world will pass black people by. We'll still be takin' the bus while
other people will be takin' rockets to the moon."</TE>
<TE>   We have no reason to dispute him. Early on, Easy's search for
Brawly takes him to a meeting of the First Men, where he sees men and
women trying "to create freedom out of the sow's ear called America.
They believed in the spirit of the Constitution and not the direction
of the cash register." But that's just moments before the police
crash the door and prove themselves the greater threat to the
republic, masking racist motives with words of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   Easy, however, has learned the hard way that nothing is certain
except killing and death. It's one reason he finds solace in the
memory of Mouse, who visits his dreams and tells him where to stand,
but that's as far as it goes: Easy's triumph in "Brawly
Brown"--Mosley's too--is being able to solve the puzzle without Mouse
at his side. By the end, he realizes that saving Brawly means saving
himself and easing the burden he's carried since the opening of the
story, unable to grieve, unable to redeem himself for leading his
friend into that ambush.</TE>
<TE>   As in his earlier books, Mosley never takes us far from the need,
the vulnerability, the fear and rage of black men in this country,
and it is the rage that has a strangely compelling vitality in
"Brawly Brown." The radicalism of the First Men has to be seen as a
measure of hope--hope that the world isn't beyond change--but Easy
draws the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Brawly came from a very different generation than mine," he
eventually realizes. "He was intelligent and ambitious where I had
been crafty and happy if I made it through the day. I never
questioned the white man's authority--that was a given.</TE>
<TE>   "But what really separated us was a need for love and his trust in
people. He believed that there was a place for him and his in the
world. I knew ... that the only way to truly save him was to shatter
this belief."</TE>
<TE>   It's a brilliant solution, no matter the cost, but by courting
disillusionment, Mosley passes a judgment of sorts on adventurism:
that political action--violent or pacific--doesn't affect anything.
Worse still, because it is grounded in hope, it is largely irrelevant
and doomed. It's a debatable issue: In the end does "Brawly Brown"
close on a note of resignation or reality?</TE>
<TE>   The answer isn't forthcoming, but what is clear is that only
grief--and love--can change a man. All else is window dressing. As
Easy says, "I'm just a everyday black man, doin' the best I can in a
world where the white man's de facto king. I got me a house with a
tree growin' in the front yard. It's my tree, I could cut it down if
I wanted to but even still you cain't call it a black man's tree.
It's just a pine."</TE>
<TE>   It is a comment that speaks not only for the place and the time
that Mosley has so effortlessly captured but also for the succeeding
years when racism--the underlying momentum of these novels--became
less institutionalized and problems once rooted in black and white
realities became more deeply ingrained in hard economic truths.</TE>
<TE>   With "Big Bad Brawly Brown," a story with the same imaginative
vigor and the same unflinching honesty as its predecessors, Mosley
continues to put a strong claim on urban crime fiction, a claim that
says as much about the city of Los Angeles as it does about America
at large. In his success, he once again leaves us eager for more. The
Watts riots and the succeeding years of neglect and disregard in
South-Central loom ahead in the dark and violent life of Ezekiel
Porterhouse Rawlins.</TE>

<AU>DAVID EBERSHOFF</AU>
<BD>David Ebershoff is the author of "The Rose City," "The
Danish Girl" and "Pasadena," just out this month.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The loner who descends into the city's underbelly cuts a familiar
figure in novels about Los Angeles: The brooder both detached from
and ensnarled by a city on the verge of eruption. Depending on the
character's state of mind and the amount of guilt and grief he is
bearing, he either witnesses evil but escapes its entrapment or he
explodes in violence.</LD>
<LD>   Think of Tod Hackett, "a very complicated young man" in Nathanael
West's "The Day of the Locust," published in 1939, the same
remarkable year that Raymond Chandler's wise but rootless crime
solver, Philip Marlowe, first appeared. Years later, in "Play It as
It Lays," Joan Didion chillingly presented a female version of the
loner on the edge ("Some people ask what makes Iago evil. I never
ask."), a character burdened by migraines and the Santa Anas and the
turbulent 1960s. More recently, Joyce Carol Oates' "Blonde," one of
the finest novels ever written about Los Angeles, chronicles the
long, short life of Marilyn Monroe.</LD>
<LD>   Now three novels by Los Angeles writers have just been published,
and if they share anything, it is a protagonist suffering from
isolation and despondency. The fullest of these, at least in terms of
plot twists and evocation of the city, is John Kaye's second novel,
"The Dead Circus."</LD>
<TE>   The book is about a mildly crooked ex-cop named Gene Burk, whose
fiancee recently died in a plane crash. Burk nurses his grief by
returning to a nearly 20-year-old obsession: the mysterious death of
rock'n'roller Bobby Fuller in 1966. As music fans and connoisseurs of
L.A. crime know, the Bobby Fuller Four had one Top 10 hit ("I Fought
the Law") and Fuller was about to make it big when he was found dead
in his car with gasoline in his lungs at the age of 23. Both in
reality and in Kaye's novel, the police declared Fuller's death a
suicide, an unsatisfying conclusion that for years has led to rumors
of murder by the mob.</TE>
<TE>   Burk's investigation into Fuller's death takes an unexpected turn
when he discovers, among his fiancee's things, eight mysterious
letters from a woman named Alice McMillan, who, we eventually find
out, is one of Charles Manson's girls, on the run from the law since
the notorious summer of 1969. Alice knew Burk's fiancee when they
were both teenagers, and now Burk has two mysteries on his hands: Who
killed Fuller and did his fiancee have a connection to Manson?</TE>
<TE>   That's enough plot for any crime novel. What ensues are two story
lines that crisscross through the underside of Hollywood and the
music scene, shifting between California in the doped-up late 1960s
and the hung-over mid-1980s. The novel begins a little loosely with
too many threads (more on that later), but halfway through, Kaye has
established that one element that every mystery--no, make that every
novel--requires: The reader is compelled to turn the page to find out
what happens next. The book's weakest moments are in its opening
pages, because Kaye's narrative style at first lurches sideways
rather than seizing the momentum skillfully established in a prior
scene. There are flashbacks within flashbacks and important clues
revealed through minor characters who have no real reason to open up
to Burk.</TE>
<TE>   Burk is a music junkie, and Kaye often relies on musical arcana to
set his scenes and tone. In describing a bar, for example, he tells
us, "On the juke box, Howlin' Wolf was singing 'Moanin' at Midnight,'
a top ten rhythm and blues hit from 1951." Sometimes this works and
sometimes it doesn't. Similarly, Kaye routinely introduces characters
by surface description: "She was in her late thirties, decent-looking
but certainly not pretty, dressed in a Levi's jacket and corduroy
pants with a light blue crew-neck sweater underneath the jacket."
Again, sometimes this succinctly sums up a character (as when Kaye
describes Burk as "sitting on the edge of his couch, making phone
calls and chain-smoking Marlboros") and sometimes it falls short
because the details, although ably written, don't really add up to
much.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the novel, celebrities appear, boldface names taking
the place of imaginative detail: Frank and Nancy Sinatra, Steve
Martin and Jack Nicholson are among those who make cameos in the way
they might in a gossip column. Even so, Burk is a strong, likable
character: the lonely guy peering into the city's pool of scum and
seeing his own blurry reflection. Once the novel's momentum takes
hold, his pursuit becomes ours.</TE>
<TE>   The grief that propels Hubert Selby Jr.'s "Waiting Period" is of a
more volatile nature. The protagonist is a man named Jack, about whom
we know little except that he bears a grudge against society. He is
looking for "a quiet, simple, satisfying way to get back at this
world for suffocating me, for crushing me, for trying to kill my
spirit." What exactly this refers to is never made clear, although
the first target of Jack's sociopathology is Harry Barnard, a clerk
in the benefits division of the Veterans Administration. Apparently,
Jack and many other veterans have suffered from Barnard's
bureaucratic indifference. Anyone who has ever waited in line at a
government office can understand red-tape rage.</TE>
<TE>   The waiting period of Selby's title refers to the timeout required
when purchasing a gun. But waiting is more symbolic than actual, for
Jack decides the best way to do away with his nemesis is not by
shooting him but by putting E. coli in his Coca-Cola. The novel's
most fully realized scene has Jack carrying out his crime at a
federal building, thinking to himself in an unapostrophed rant: "I
guess all governments, at all levels, want you to know youre on
government property by making it, at the very least, unattractive.
Its incredible, as soon as youre out of the government area the
streets are lined and shady, birds sing, everything looks, sounds and
feels peaceful, then one more step and youre approaching the pits of
hell."</TE>
<TE>   Selby, the author of "Last Exit to Brooklyn," has written a
monologue as much as a novel. Jack's disembodied voice drives the
narrative, sinking into a bottomless pathology. At its best, "Waiting
Period" is a frightening portrait of senseless fury and tells the
terrible truth about a man who is setting out to kill for no reason
at all.</TE>
<TE>   Readers familiar with Dennis Cooper's work will recognize his
time-bomb Los Angeles and the lonely boys crouching to light its
fuse. In his new novel, "My Loose Thread," a teenager named Larry
thinks he has killed his best friend, Rand, during a fight. In truth,
Rand suffered an aneurysm, but Larry doesn't believe anyone who tries
to wrest away his guilt.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Larry and Rand were fighting over Larry's 13-year-old
brother, Jim. Larry is in love with Jim, and the two have been
sleeping together for some time. Larry, who is gripped by a child's
all-consuming fear, is more afraid of losing his brother than
anything else. It is this fear that unleashes a series of killings,
carried out with a teenage numbness to the world: Even as triggers
are pulled, we know that the characters don't know what they are
doing. In this anonymous Los Angeles high school, Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold, the Columbine killers, are heroes, and the wan
students stoop with pre-guilt, resigned to their vicious fates.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his cold, hard eye, Cooper is an empathetic writer, one
who seems to loathe the world he is depicting as much as he loves the
people in it. He never condemns; he is only concerned with dissecting
adolescent desperation. He is intimate with the feeling of
nothingness that overtakes teenagers slouching toward violence and
random cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the writer J.T. LeRoy has explored similar emotional
territory, perhaps with an even more authentic adolescent voice than
Cooper's, but what makes Cooper's work fierce and unforgettable is
the bleakness of his vision. Cooper has seen a Southern California,
an America, of hopelessness and he has written about it without pity.
His novels are not dispatches from the fiery future but calls for
help from the world today.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of "My Loose Thread," Larry is sitting outside his
school when a student shooting erupts inside. He ponders the sound of
death and searches for meaning and eventually gives up: "I keep
thinking [the gunman] stopped, or was tackled and stopped by someone.
Then I'll hear another shot. They've gotten weirdly far apart. So I
guess he finally cares about who's getting killed. Maybe they're even
people he knows. Eventually the shooting just ends. Maybe when he
started to care who was dead he realized he could die. Or he finally
figured out what he wanted to do, and either did it or knew that he
couldn't. Maybe the last shot was aimed at himself. It sounded like
all the others."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles novel has come a long way from "The Day of the
Locust," or has it? The city's violent undertow continues to pull and
tug at a certain type of imagining, at a certain type of writer. The
books that result tell us a little more about our city and about our
own darker impulses.</TE>

<DH>THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE AND THE FINAL SOLUTION: A
Reconsideration, By Mark Roseman, Metropolitan Books:  212 pp., $23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FRANK</AU>
<BD>Michael Frank is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a wintry morning in January 1942, 15 German bureaucrats,
representatives of ministries responsible for the "Jewish question,"
repaired to a comfortable villa by a lake in Wannsee, a suburb
southwest of Berlin where members of the German bourgeoisie had been
summering since the late 19th century. The villa had a lake view, a
music room and a billiards table and offered pleasant food, central
heating and hot and cold running water. The men sat around a table
for perhaps an hour and a half. They talked; they listened; they
conferred. By the meeting's end, fortified by brandy, they appear to
have sealed the fate of European Jewry.</LD>
<LD>   This meeting, which was known as the Wannsee Conference, produced
a document, "The Wannsee Protocol," which was discovered in 1947 and
called "perhaps the most shameful document in modern history" by
Robert Kempner, the man responsible for prosecuting the German
ministries after the war. Shameful it was, indisputably, yet for more
than half a century both the protocol and the conference have
retained a mystery as to their exact place, and purpose, in the
Nazis' murderous campaign against the Jews.</LD>
<TE>   In "The Wannsee Conference and the Final Solution," Mark Roseman
sets out not to solve this mystery so much as to anatomize it, to
dissect the thinking of the key players and to present the central
themes, ideas and intentions of the day. He does so with the same
determination and respect that he brought to "A Past in Hiding," his
life of Marianne Strauss, an "ordinary" young German Jewish woman who
lived in open hiding in wartime Nazi Germany, which remains an
unforgettable contribution to Holocaust studies.</TE>
<TE>   "The Wannsee Conference" is a narrower, and less narrative, book.
Roseman's subject is not, this time, the victims but the perpetrators
of the Nazi genocide, and his focus is even tighter as he seeks to
interpret what he calls "the Rosetta stone of Nazi murder," a "deeply
mysterious document [that] seems to capture the precise moment when
the Nazis decided to eliminate the Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Why so much seeming and appearing, why so much mystery and
perhaps? First, the central facts: The meeting was called by Reinhard
Heydrich, head of the Nazi Security Service and chief of the German
Security Police. Accompanying him were his Gestapo chief, Heinrich
Muller, and his subordinate, Adolf Eichmann. In addition to the
ministries' representatives (Interior, Justice, Economics,
Propaganda, Foreign Office, Occupied Eastern Territories and so on),
the other invitees were all from party and SS agencies with a special
interest in race questions. They were mostly young, well-educated and
politically ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   The protocol is not the actual transcript of the minutes but the
version that Heydrich edited and later distributed to the
participants (the copy that survives is No. 16 of 30). As thus
represented, the meeting, which Heydrich led, began with his survey
of the measures taken by the Nazis toward the Jews up to 1941. These
included the removal of the Jews first from "every sphere of life of
the German people"; expulsion of the Jews from the "living space" of
the German people; emigration; and "a new solution," evacuating Jews
to the East. These steps are seen as providing only temporary relief,
which is nonetheless "of great significance for the coming final
solution of the Jewish question."</TE>
<TE>   Next there is a tally, country by country, including those under
German control and those not, of the more than 11 million European
Jews who would be affected by this "coming final solution." After
that the protocol moves on to detail this "solution," the evacuation
of Jews in the East, where "doubtless the large majority will be
eliminated by natural causes." The human beings who survive, "the
most resistant elements," "will have to be dealt with appropriately."
From here the meeting took up issues concerning half- and
quarter-Jews, war-decorated Jews and mixed Jewish and gentile
marriages.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite using the language of evacuation," Roseman observes in
declarative passage early on his book, "the minutes unmistakably
contain a plan for genocide, formulated in sober bureaucratic
language, deliberated on in civilized surroundings in a once
cosmopolitan suburb of Berlin."</TE>
<TE>   If the plan for genocide is unmistakable, what, then, is so
confounding about the protocol? For one thing, there is the
bedeviling issue of chronology. The protocol implies that the
groundwork for the Final Solution had still not been prepared in
January 1942 and therefore poses a question central to the history of
the Holocaust: Was genocide the result of a long-established plan or
was it worked out as the war unfolded?</TE>
<TE>   Could the Wannsee Conference be the moment, and the place, at
which the Nazis decided to exterminate the Jews? Roseman, after some
consideration, believes not, for several reasons: Hitler was not at
the conference; the attendees were too junior to make such a decision
on their own; and the timing seems off, since the mass murder of
Soviet Jews had begun six months earlier, Polish Jews had been gassed
at Chelmno since early December 1941 and the death camp at Belzec was
already under construction.</TE>
<TE>   For Roseman, all this makes the protocol at once perplexing and
compelling; he sees it as a rare "keyhole through which we can
glimpse the emerging Final Solution," but he also recognizes that it
is a document, "not a camera-eye view." And although the document is
lean, chilling and bureaucratic, a curious mixture of "procedure and
prejudice," it leaves a number of questions unanswered. It does not
specify the means of killing; it doesn't say who decided what and
when; and it does not--even--precisely confer guilt.</TE>
<TE>   At his trial in Jerusalem, Eichmann insisted that the language at
the actual meeting had been more open about the killings than the
protocol suggests; but this was in keeping with his defense, that his
superiors had given clear killing orders. At the Nuremberg trials the
ministerial bureaucrats contradicted Eichmann, maintaining that
nothing had been said openly; even Friedrich-Wilhelm Kritzinger (from
the Reich Chancellery), who was alone among those examined by Kempner
after the war in expressing his shame, denied that the killings had
been discussed.</TE>
<TE>   Where does all this leave us? Roseman believes that "The Wannsee
Protocol" captures the moment when a comprehensive plan for the
annihilation of the Jews was just emerging. Like the inconsistent
fossil record that anthropologists work with in establishing the
evolution of early man, the protocol emerges as just one particularly
ugly, unusually--if still elusively--specific piece of evidence to
have survived from the Nazi regime. Historians may circle around the
decisions it pinpoints, or fails to, but this much at least remains
clear: The Nazis, primed by Hitler to destroy the Jews, had no
compunction about advancing their campaign through killing, and what
Roseman calls the "most shameful document" demonstrates that the
"deed of murder begat the idea of genocide as much as the other way
around."</TE>

<HD>The Queen's Throat</HD>
<DH>MAWRDEW CZGOWCHWZ: A Novel, By James McCourt, New York
Review Books:  210 pp., $12.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GILES</AU>
<BD>Patrick Giles is associate editor of Interview
magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To answer your first question: It's pronounced "Mardu Gorgeous." Next
answer: It's the name of the heroine of this novel, first published
in 1975, set in a kingdom of creativity, style, high standards and
pleasure called Greater New York. Into that exciting and
self-involved late '40s metropolis descends a goddess, a near-unknown
Czech singer discovered by seven local opera fanatics. She makes
back-to-back debuts at Carnegie Hall and the old Metropolitan Opera
House, revealing a voice so large and magnificent it converts her
last name from a tongue-twister to a self-description. Once Mawrdew
Czgowchwz sings, the town, its new diva--and American fiction
itself--are never again the same.</LD>
<LD>   If, as Vladimir Nabokov once instructed his Cornell
undergraduates, great writers are great enchanters, then James
McCourt, in his first work, waved his pen to produce a place for
himself among the major American writers of our day. Enchantment is
the modus operandi of "Mawrdew Czgowchwz": action, characters,
diction and tone whisk the reader into a state of blissful,
jaw-dropping belief.</LD>
<TE>   On page four of this long-awaited republication, the Times
announces the return of the "falcon contralto" to the Metropolitan
after a feud with its management and "in the wake of a hunger strike
in which several thousand of her admirers had participated, and which
resulted in a two-week sit-down demonstration in front of the opera
house." This blithe gunning into imaginative overdrive occasions the
first delighted reader gasp; that certified Times old-gray-ladyness
in the face of the marvelous establishes that McCourt creates from a
conviction, accomplishment and sense of humor far above most other
writers. (The "Continued on Page 37, Column 1" a few lines later
confirms suspicions.)</TE>
<TE>   McCourt's story grows steadily and with flawless virtuosity; it
also gets crowded (its 210 pages have as many characters--each and
every one superbly named--as Dickens at his lengthiest). We follow
Czgowchwz as her talent subjugates any and every music written for
the female voice. But as another legendary legend, Elaine Stritch,
affirmed on "60 Minutes" recently, talent also gets you into a lot of
trouble: The whole middle of "Mawrdew Czgowchwz" details the
treachery of envious conspirators out to get this supremely gifted
artist. The inadvertent result--Czgowchwz is rescued into another,
more glorious phase of personal and creative luminescence--is another
of McCourt's flawlessly aimed and timed wand-strokes.</TE>
<TE>   Alert fiction lovers might already be asking: How come I've never
heard of this book, let alone read it or pretended to have read it?
The obvious answer is the one offered by glib "Czgowchwz" readers
when quizzed as to its subject: "It's about opera." American
literature, which takes its tragic power awfully seriously, and
opera, an equally tragic yet heedlessly extravagant and gregarious
form, seldom fit each other. (And the latter is even less familiar to
Americans than the former.) A first flip through "Mawrdew Czgowchwz"
might create the impression it's merely an insider pleasure. It can
facilitate enjoyment to know, for example, that the title character's
initials match not only the first two letters of her author's last
name (and almost those of Miliza Korjus, the soprano featured in the
1938 MGM film "The Great Waltz," who partially inspired the author)
but also those of the real-life prima donna of this novel's golden
age, Maria Callas. (The story literally sails off into the sunset
right before Callas' 1956 New York debut.) It will delight the
operatically challenged to discover that the novel's "Lois the
switchboard girl" is not a McCourt invention and that, half a century
after his story concluded, the real-life Lois still attends nearly
every Met performance (a moving besting of fantasy by reality).</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't really so much a novel about opera as it is a grand
masque celebrating the harmony possible between art and life and the
redemptive potential for greatness in both. It's through the fervor
of her art that Czgowchwz ultimately wins "a life as distinct from a
career." In McCourt's Gotham, life is not only enriched by art (to
say nothing of gossip, which slithers through these pages like a
happy snake in Eden), it is overtaken by it--and made as splendid and
remarkable as we all hope life will someday be. Even his city's rare
cultural lulls ("All in all it was all ... less. There were
complaints in columns") are suddenly grazed by the fantastic ("The
Pope saw Christ come and go").</TE>
<TE>   The triumphalist fervor of McCourt's depiction of genius-as-life
has been even less fashionable among fiction arbiters than opera.
"Mawrdew Czgowchwz" is definitely not listed among the august
masterworks in Harold Bloom's "The Western Canon;" Camille Paglia
never rhapsodized over it; nor has the literary elite's designated
eulogizer, James Wood, solemnized it, at any length. To be fair, it
is hard to critically grapple with a creation that so completely
disarms via its own mastery, fails to fit into any of the
oppressed-group factions mauling the study of American letters and
doesn't need anyone to tell its readers it's "a swell story, real
worthwhile!" as showgirl Trixie Gilhooley burbles. (The introduction
that burdens this reissue demonstrates current literary fashion's
hopelessness regarding this text.)</TE>
<TE>   What's more, comic novels are seldom canonized (the
seriousness-equals-literature thing again). It's hard to be scholarly
and critical in the face of this book's smart-alecky outrageousness,
its opera stars (and opera queens) dashing through a flawlessly
sardonic Gotham in which even the late Cardinal Francis Spellman is
rendered a creature of phlegmatic camp. But bear in mind Flannery
O'Connor's "All comic novels that are any good must be about matters
of life and death." Behind this novel's lightheartedness hovers a
serious soul. It knows and bemoans that its perfect city, eager to
find and cherish the highest creative endeavor, was vanishing as its
own words were written. The Old Met and Pennsylvania Station, public
palaces of a metropolis comfortable with grandeur, had already
surrendered to the wrecking ball; a sophisticated musical culture
flourishing before the exploitation of adolescent rebellion took over
American music was in the process of crumbling, too. So did many of
McCourt's initial believers: One of the lesser-known side effects of
the AIDS epidemic is its devastation of gay opera lovers. (Nearly
everyone I discovered this book with is now dead.)</TE>
<TE>   McCourt's tireless imagination may keep these reissued pages
crackling, but his faith in the glory of art and his insistence that
"the heroic conduct of life is absolute" make this not only a
hilarious pleasure but an affirmation of faith. Could this book
undergo what one of its characters calls "The Czgowchwz Moment,"
winning the comeback it deserves? "Mawrdew Czgowchwz" seems downright
anachronistic at a time when a leading Harvard professor (and his
editors at The New Yorker, no less) distinguish themselves by not
recognizing a 19th century imitation of the famous opening of "Bleak
House" and when our own musical Madonna can barely carry a tune. But
we have weathered dumb and ridiculous cultural moments before; and
great works of art not only edify and inspire but rescue. Gotham and
the entire literary skyline need McCourt's comic perfectionism more
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `Mawrdew Czgowchwz'</TE>
<TE>   The third act began in a hush. The shepherd's plaintive horn
sounded high up on the slanting geometric precipice of Tristan's
castle's watchtower, set at a dizzy angle against a restless
cycloramic sea-and-sky projection representing the horizon off the
coast of Brittany. The music keened on, a stark stretch. Dozens of
subtly graduated light cues created weird, unsettling effects. In the
wings, immobile behind a jagged, vaulted flat, Mawrdew Czgowchwz,
still searching for that key to the Liebestod, slipped into
meditation, into reverie, into the sea-sky, anxiety-ridden
projection, into the horn's melisma ...</TE>

<DH>THE DREAM OF SCIPIO: A Novel, By Iain Pears, Riverhead
Books: 402 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "An Instance of the Fingerpost"--a novel whose title referred to
the rarity of unambiguous evidence--Iain Pears described a murder
case in 17th century England through the eyes of several characters.
All their accounts were partly true, and all were misleading. In "The
Dream of Scipio," Pears is equally ambitious: He views a perennial
problem--What should civilized people do when civilization
collapses?--through the eyes of residents of southern France in three
widely spaced historical eras.</LD>
<LD>   Manlius Hippomanes, a landowner and philosopher in the 5th
century, watches as barbarians dismantle the last of Roman Gaul.
Olivier de Noyen, a poet at the papal court in Avignon, discovers
Manlius' legacy--a manuscript called "The Dream of Scipio"--just
before the Black Death of 1347-50 kills a third of Europe's
population. Julien Barneuve, a scholar who has read both Manlius and
Olivier, finds himself working as a censor for the Vichy government
after the Nazis conquer France in 1940.</LD>
<TE>   "Power without wisdom is tyranny; wisdom without power is
pointless," says Sophia, a Greek woman who has taught Manlius
neo-Platonist philosophy and who is his platonic lover. Under her
prodding, he abandons a life of contemplation for one of action.
Manlius perceives that the only power left in the Provence of his
time is Christianity. So he feigns conversion and is made a bishop,
surrendering the region to the half-tame Burgundians to avoid
destruction by the Goths.</TE>
<TE>   The breadth and clarity of Manlius' vision astounds Julien a
millennium and a half later. He doesn't realize at first that "The
Dream of Scipio"--its title borrowed from a famous work by Cicero--is
Manlius' attempt to justify the evils he commits in the name of
preventing greater evils. Manlius kills his adopted son, has his best
friend murdered and, to cement his popularity, "converts" the Jews of
his native city, Vaison, by the sword. Julien, too, is reluctantly
pulled from his books to public life. He collaborates with Vichy to
moderate the demands of a former friend who heads the French
provincial administration (and is trying in turn to moderate the
demands of the Germans). He congratulates himself on his deftness
until his lover, Julia, a painter and a Jew, is arrested in 1943 and
sent to the death camps.</TE>
<TE>   He realizes then that the logic Manlius used to persecute the Jews
has lurked like a poison in the bloodstream of Western civilization
ever since. By Olivier's time, Manlius had been canonized as a saint.
The conversion of the Jews is ranked as his greatest accomplishment.
Sophia, too, is a saint--credited, ironically, with converting
Manlius to Christianity, when in fact she disdained that religion and
was appalled by his proto-Machiavellian methods.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Manlius and Julien, Olivier isn't a rationalist. He doesn't
identify himself with civilization or attempt to shape history. He is
narrow, passionate, romantic. He is said to have fallen in love with
a countess and killed her when she tried to flee the plague rather
than stay near him. Olivier was then horribly punished by her
husband. Julien debunks this story, finding that Olivier loved
another woman--a Jew--and that he had something to do with Pope
Clement VI's remarkable proclamation that the Jews, instead of being
scapegoats for the plague, should be protected.</TE>
<TE>   Pears--working in the shadow of Albert Camus' "The Plague," which
used disease as a metaphor for the Nazi occupation of France--links
the three narratives with his own omniscient voice. He is lucid and
informative but compared with Camus, a little bloodless. His
characters all sound alike. His intellectual framework--though
audacious and sophisticated and admirably suited for an essay--is
confining for fiction.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dream of Scipio" shows us little of Nazi atrocities or of the
terrors with which the Goths threaten Manlius' world. Only the Black
Death is vivid. The moral problem that Pears poses is intractable:
Neither faith nor reason is an unerring guide. But he leads us to
view Olivier's response, uncalculating and human, as the best.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Pears wouldn't go so far as to say, with E.M. Forster,
that "if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying
my friend I hope I should have the guts to betray my country." But
it's safe to infer that he wouldn't rush, after Sept. 11, to
sacrifice civil liberties to the war on terrorism. And he has Julien
conclude: "It is the civilized who are the truly barbaric, and the
Germans are merely the supreme expression of it .... We have done
terrible things, for the best of reasons, and that makes it worse."</TE>

<DH>HONG KONG COMICS: A History of Manhua, By Wendy Siuyi Wong,
Princeton Architectural Press: 208 pp., $25 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THEA KLAPWALD</AU>
<BD>Thea Klapwald has written for the (London) Times
Literary Supplement and other publications, and is working on a novel
about expatriates living in Hong Kong.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Living in Hong Kong in the early 1990s, I found that action films
were as commonplace and plentiful as chicken feet at dim sum. Back in
America, however, they were known to and admired only by people whom
I considered to be fanatics: a geeky subset of genre film buffs (my
apologies to Quentin Tarantino). Jackie Chan had yet to release
"Rumble in the Bronx" and was still gun-shy about any reentry into
American cinemas after a dismal response to his films in the 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   For Chow Yun-Fat, Jet Li and Tsui Hark, Hollywood was akin to the
Emerald City, a distant dreamlike place. They spoke of it in hushed
tones and wished John Woo well with his first endeavor there, a
Jean-Claude Van Damme flick better left unnamed. But they were
content for their old friend and colleague to be the guinea pig. And
Woo knew that if he was going to make it in America he would have to
do it without aerial wires and period costumes.</LD>
<LD>   Cut to almost 10 years later. Mild-mannered Ang Lee, director of
the most subtle and highbrow character-driven films "Eat Drink Man
Woman," "Sense and Sensibility" and "The Ice Storm," collects an
Oscar for "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." Next, the spoof film,
"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist," an updated version of "What's Up, Tiger
Lily?," is released, the penultimate symbol of a genre arriving in
Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Now, Hong Kong-style action movies are as American as baseball,
apple pie and Chinese takeout. The crossover is complete; movies and
technology have been appropriated, assimilated and reinvented
American-style. (Just look at the choreography of Keanu Reeves' fight
scenes in "The Matrix.")</TE>
<TE>   By all rights then, "Hong Kong Comics: A History of Manhua" by
Wendy Siuyi Wong will be a bestseller and end up both on the bedside
tables of soccer moms and inside backpacks of Art Center students.
The book is an encyclopedia of comics and the graphic art form called
manhua, known as manga in Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Although manhua includes everything from political satire to
children's tales, it is best known for its wuxia or kung fu
characters. This type of manhua was the natural springboard for Hong
Kong action films. Think comic book superheroes: Spider-Man, Superman
and Batman. The influence, though, went both ways. A comic book based
on Bruce Lee called "Lee Siu-lung" (his Chinese name) was extremely
popular, as was "Black Batman," which was based on its American
counterpart and used its villains and story lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Hong Kong Comics" catalogs the popular and populist form from its
beginnings at the turn of the 20th century to its present
incarnation. Always, manhua was used for creative storytelling as a
way to reach the broadest audience possible.</TE>
<TE>   The book is divided into four parts: satirical and political
manhua, comical manhua, action manhua and children's manhua. There
are more than 1,000 illustrations with extraordinarily detailed
captions and comprehensive appendices, making it the bible on the
subject. It is a compelling work that is extremely tactile, demanding
to be caressed, perused and studied. Artists will find "new" images
to "borrow" and incorporate into their own work. As a result, just
like the art form itself, the book appeals to readers of all levels.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to see why "Hong Kong Comics," which was originally
published in Hong Kong in Chinese, appealed to an American press and
is now published in English. Ten years ago, it might have been a leap
of faith. Today, it is assured a proper audience and reception.</TE>

<DH>WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN: A Memoir, By Bob Kerrey, James H.
Silberman /  Harcourt: 274 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY I. KUTLER</AU>
<BD>Stanley I. Kutler is the author of "The Wars of
Watergate" and the editor of "The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Vietnam War lies like an angry scar across America. The political
and cultural divisions of the time echo and reverberate constantly.
Certainly, the young men who fought in that war, distinguished for
its length and futility, never again were the same. If they survived,
they were changed; the war was their defining experience. And they
are special, for they were part of a terrible national failure.</LD>
<LD>   Few stories more eloquently testify to such change than that of
former U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.). But his loss is accompanied
with a parable of his fall from grace. Much of his story is familiar,
even commonplace. In "When I Was a Young Man," he offers the
narrative of a young boy, happy and safe in the homogeneous environs
of Lincoln, Neb., son of a World War II veteran, with a solidly
Republican family. He was only vaguely aware of the "Red Menace,"
whether from communists who might poison the drinking water or from
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's endorsement of the domino theory and
the specter of a communist army on the shores of La Jolla, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   Kerrey was 16 when the civil rights struggle erupted and when the
first Americans died in Vietnam, but, secure in Lincoln, he remained
relatively oblivious to it all. Neither the Geneva Accords of 1954,
ending the French imperial presence in Vietnam, nor the Brown vs.
Board of Education desegregation decision that same year would
attract his attention for another decade. He remembered being told in
1964 that if Barry Goldwater were elected, the United States'
involvement in Vietnam would expand. Goldwater lost, but the war
expanded anyway, an older, more cynical Kerrey writes.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrey's memoir is confined to his youth and the events that
irrevocably altered his life. He quickly glosses over his conversion
to the Democratic Party, his successful business career, his service
as governor and senator and his brief 1992 presidential campaign. The
center of "When I Was a Young Man" is one brief chapter relating his
memory of his two engagements in Vietnam: one that killed only
Vietnamese civilians and may have involved a terrible crime, and one
that cost him part of his right leg and resulted in the Medal of
Honor. The first came to public attention in 2001, with statements by
Kerrey's unit members and by two female survivors who recounted
varying versions of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry appends a one-page author's note, mentioning the discussion
he and his fellow combatants had 32 years after the event, relating
their individual memories. Kerrey's final words are that he cannot
swear that his memory is 100% accurate, but "it is merely the best I
can remember today."</TE>
<TE>   A year before the incident, Kerrey entered the military when he
reported for Naval Officer Candidate School in February 1967. Once
commissioned, he trained as a frogman, slated to serve with an
underwater demolition team. The program was demanding, but "it was
too exciting to pass up," he remembered and, along with a few others,
he survived the rigorous training. When he completed the course,
Kerrey volunteered for the Navy's new SEAL program. The recruits,
similar to the Army's Special Operations Group, would have special
assignments in Vietnam, vastly different from what he and his
classmates had been led to expect. Told they could "volunteer" for
the new program--or be sent to sea--one frogman refused. He was
immediately ushered from the room, and Kerrey never saw him again.
"His act was the bravest I had ever witnessed," Kerrey remembered.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrey's classmate, we now know, balked at being part of a
kidnapping and assassination team. The SEALs were trained to operate
behind enemy lines, collect intelligence and "take out" Viet Cong
leaders, suspected or otherwise. The 25-year-old inexperienced Lt.
Kerrey spent about 50 days in Vietnam and took part in only two
combat engagements. In the second, Kerrey suffered his terrible wound
and loss of right foot when a grenade hit him, and he received the
nation's highest military honor. During his first mission, a search
for Viet Cong units in the village of Thanh Phong, Kerrey and his men
encountered the women of the village. We "tried to do our duty as we
had been trained to do it," he laconically writes.</TE>
<TE>   Conflicting stories of that horrible night have emerged. One of
Kerrey's men, haunted with dreadful memories for decades, claims the
Americans rounded up the Vietnamese civilians and simply executed
them. No other members of the squad corroborate this account. Kerrey
says that shots were fired at his unit and that it returned the fire.
Whichever is true, an "atrocity" was born. One thing is clear:
Civilians were killed. Kerrey's own account is searing: "We returned
a tremendous barrage of fire and began to withdraw, continuing to
fire. I saw women and children in front of us being hit and cut to
pieces. I heard their cries and other voices in the darkness as we
made our retreat to the canal."</TE>
<TE>   Kerrey first received a Bronze Star in 1969, with a citation
giving a fictitious account of the event. His superiors knew that
civilians had been killed but, nevertheless, they commended the
SEALs' operation. For his part, Kerrey has said, "I don't feel like I
did anything heroic that evening. Quite the contrary."</TE>
<TE>   However cloudy his memory, Kerrey knows he was never the same
afterward. "The young, innocent man who went to Vietnam died that
night.... I no longer had illusions or objectivity about the war. I
became someone I did not recognize." He had been in country for five
weeks, and this was his first combat. "It had not ended in the heroic
way I had expected." Still, he accepted his medal, with its falsified
citation of the event, and mentions no misgivings at the moment. But
we must remember that we did not share the circumstances of Kerrey
and his men. Our judgments, too, must be restrained and conflicted.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrey painfully and candidly discusses his long medical recovery.
He remembers his ambivalence at accepting the Medal of Honor, knowing
that President Richard M. Nixon used such occasions for political
gain and having serious doubts about the merit of it. In this
account, Kerrey offers no other details of his commendation. His men
had supported him for the Silver Star because he continued to lead
their squad despite his serious wound, but the recommendation had
been upgraded. He does not tell us by whom, or why--if he knows. He
was "stunned and embarrassed"; he "did not believe the action
deserved the highest honor." But his men urged him to accept the
award "for everyone who should have been recognized but was not."
Thanh Phong's unwanted notoriety as an atrocity was more than three
decades in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The atrocity at My Lai and the role of Lt. William Calley occurred
nine months before Thanh Phong. The melancholy tale of My Lai now has
been known for more than three decades, but not until Gregory
Vistica's story appeared in the New York Times in 2001 did we learn
of Kerrey's incident. Kerrey's service record was distinguished with
medals. Calley was a nondescript soldier. He was convicted of
premeditated murder and sentenced to life at hard labor but served
only three years of house arrest at Ft. Benning. What if Calley could
or would speak? Only Kerrey's public prominence has made the events
at Thanh Phong a national story. Certainly, what happened there must
not be minimized. But we must bear in mind that we have had more than
120 convictions for war crimes in Vietnam. And are there other Thanh
Phongs yet to be revealed?</TE>
<TE>   Though we knew nothing of Thanh Phong during Kerrey's years on the
national political scene, his public postures often seemed laced with
a trace of cynicism, even bitterness. His well-known skepticism
toward President Bill Clinton somehow seemed rooted in a feeling that
he had seen and done so much more and thus was more deserving of the
presidency. The revelation of what happened in Vietnam and even his
cursory explanation help explain more of this enigmatic man; it
certainly makes him more interesting, if not likable.</TE>
<TE>   Kerrey is eager now to tell his story "because of the powerful
needs that oppose remembering the bad along with the good when we
Americans rev up our patriotic engines." Recalling the Democratic
politician who bragged in 1992 that we had won the Cold War without
firing a shot, Kerrey wonders what people thought we were firing in
Korea and Vietnam and what our proxies were firing in Central
America, South America and Africa. Wars are not, he knows, "what our
slogans, propaganda, and childhood fantasies have taught us to
believe." Kerrey was trained and expected to be a lethal weapon
against anyone in a "free fire zone." And so he served. The cynical
public man remains very much with us; maybe now, we can better
understand why. We can share what he calls a "sickness in my heart
for what we had done." We cannot envy his burdens.</TE>

<HD>The Second Coming</HD>
<DH>WAYFARING AT WAVERLY IN SILVER LAKE: Stories, By James
McCourt, Alfred A. Knopf: 324 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAVIN LAMBERT</AU>
<BD>Gavin Lambert is the author of "Inside Daisy Clover"
and "The Slide Area," which were recently reissued. His most recent
books are "On Cukor" and "Mainly About Lindsay Anderson."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The legendary Hollywood star Kaye Wayfaring made her fictional debut
in James McCourt's "Kaye Wayfaring in 'Avenged' "--"Avenged" being
the title of the Hollywood star's first comeback movie in the early
1980s. In the sequel, "Wayfaring at Waverly in Silver Lake" (like the
earlier book, a series of linked stories or episodes), she emerges
from her Waverly Drive hideaway for a repeat performance 10 years
later in "The Undertow," director Orphrey Whither's "most
uncompromising foray into auteur sadism." The movie industry thinks
Wayfaring is over the hill at 50, and she's overweight as well, but
as Astarte ("fuchsia-haired Beverly Hills astrologer, industry scold,
civic activist") tells her: "Your career has always been one long
embrace of your obstacles, which you have always realized as your
material."</LD>
<TE>   The idea of transmuting personal obstacles into art has a
universal resonance, and it's an idea that recurs throughout
McCourt's fiction, beginning with his first novel "Mawrdew Czgowchwz"
(just reissued by New York Review Books), about a Czech-Irish opera
singer who undergoes a severe identity crisis while singing Isolde at
the Met. Another kind of diva appeared in "Time Remaining," with the
former transvestite ballerina Odette O'Doyle, once described as "the
woman Toumanova is trying to be," carrying out the wishes of several
friends and peers, all casualties of AIDS, by scattering their ashes
over various European locations. Odette suffers from "survivor guilt"
when (s)he returns, then realizes that by writing the stories of the
dead, "there will be in the telling a point at which they will not
yet have been dead."</TE>
<TE>   Wayfaring is in the process of resurrection or, more accurately, a
second coming. "She is walking the tightrope to greatness. There has
been nothing like it since Jeanne Eagels in 'The Letter,' " a friend
remarks after seeing "Avenged." There was Oscar buzz then but no
nomination. This time, after "The Undertow," there is Oscar buzz and
a nomination. "Do I want the thing?" she wonders. "What's not to
want? Don't ask."</TE>
<TE>   Like many of McCourt's characters, she has moods that swing from
dark to brilliant, with an intervening pause at darkly brilliant.
She's haunted by the memory of her mother's suicide and of two
Hollywood casualties, Marilyn Monroe, whom she knew and liked, and
Peg Entwistle, whom she never met. (Entwistle was the out-of-work bit
player who jumped to her death from the Hollywoodland sign in 1932,
and Wayfaring finds it "surprising" that when the sign was repaired
and abbreviated to Hollywood, "they didn't bother to create a
mechanical Peg Entwistle replica that would jump off the H once a
day, at noon, accompanied by civil defense sirens.")</TE>
<TE>   Wayfaring's adolescent son Tristan also haunts her interior
monologues, especially after he flees in panic to a remote Pacific
beach after realizing that he's gay. He is befriended by a group of
young druggies as terrifyingly well-read as Tristan himself and
nearly dies after they inject seawater into his veins. When he
recovers, he looks back on the episode with a mixture of
introspection and detachment as "a self-contained exploration of
personal experience that hopefully also dramatizes the sense of life
as an elusive process whose depths resist interpretation."</TE>
<TE>   The episode is also one of the most ironically imagined yet
devastating accounts of homosexual panic ever written, because its
victim is otherwise so super-cool, beautiful and articulate. Tristan
shares a very personal gift of the gab with his mother and her
friends, notably the producer Leland de Longpre, who describes
contemporary movie stars as "twentysomething freeze-dried-sock-puppet
airheads untempted by any articulated form of knowledge, who in
deep-stall idiot bliss make pizza-boy eyes into the Steadicam lens
and whisper 'Eat me.' " Did any Hollywood producer ever talk like
that? Unfortunately not.</TE>
<TE>   Did any Hollywood star sit alone, like Wayfaring, in a downtown
coffee shop on Halloween, "fingering the cubes in the sugar bowl and
remembering the sugar skulls in Mexico on the Day of the Dead"? Or
have the audacity to remain in her car outside the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion on Oscar night while the Best Actress award is announced?</TE>
<TE>   "Has it ever occurred to you one may be artificial by nature?"
Tristan's cry from the heart is also a cry from the author's heart,
for McCourt is a brilliant practitioner of what Cyril Connolly called
the Mandarin style. Its aim, according to Connolly (who cited the
later novels of Henry James as avatar of the style) was "to make the
written word as unlike as possible to the spoken one." But, as Oscar
Wilde anticipated, its other equally important, aim was to turn the
comedy of manners into a medium for subverting manners and morals.</TE>
<TE>   Wilde's most direct descendant, Ronald Firbank, did the same thing
in his novels of the 1920s, "The Flower Beneath the Foot" and
"Concerning the Eccentricities of Cardinal Pirelli." (The cardinal's
eccentricities, by the way, appear uncannily topical today, like
Odette O'Doyle's remark: "No lady except a cardinal in the Roman
Catholic church--wears ermine in the morning.")</TE>
<TE>   McCourt is Firbank's most direct (and more robust) descendant,
even more unafraid to extend the boundaries of what is permissible to
laugh at and to reject conventional narrative. In terms of direct
action, not much happens, but a lot goes on in terms of dialogue
(including reported action) and interior monologue. These characters
live from private moment to private moment and from one epiphany to
another, sudden revelations of happiness, absurdity, hope, pain. And
their points of reference (like their author's) define the word
"eclectic," ranging from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Barbara Stanwyck in
"Double Indemnity," William James to Marlon Brando's dislike of
publicity ("it interfered with his self-absorption").</TE>
<TE>   "Wayfaring at Waverly in Silver Lake" is too idiosyncratic to file
under "Los Angeles" or "Hollywood." Its world is "an exaggeration of
the possible," as Raymond Chandler once defined melodrama, a
definition that does equally well for a style of comedy whose sense
of the absurd is as unexpected (and politically incorrect) as its
sense of mortality.</TE>
<TE>   Wayfaring is especially prone to mortal daydreams, whether in a
downtown coffee shop or on her terrace while Santa Ana winds whip the
palm trees: "Some broken palm fronds lay on the terrace amid swirls
of leaves off deciduous trees, blown all the way to Silver Lake from
the New England section of Forest Lawn (where Bette Davis lay)."</TE>
<TE>   In a story by James Purdy, America's senior Mandarin writer, a
wife remarks to her husband: "I wonder how I will get out of here."</TE>
<TE>   "Out of where?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Out of where I seem to have got into," she replies.</TE>
<TE>   The "where" in Purdy's story is the institution of marriage, but
in a larger sense it applies to the situations in which Purdy's
characters, like McCourt's, find themselves. In a similar moment,
Wayfaring is reminded by "the zesty voice" of KBYZ's Radio-Gaga,
"Remember, how you got there says who you are today!" By taking an
unfamiliar route to familiar problems (of love, death, identity),
McCourt is also saying who he is by how he gets there; and in his
case, both the journey and the arrival matter, because both are
equally startling.</TE>

<HD>Passage to Hong Kong</HD>
<DH>FRAGRANT HARBOR: A Novel, By John Lanchester, Marian Wood /
G.P. Putnam's  Sons: 342 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN LEVI</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Levi is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer is icummen in, and loudly we go cuckoo for DVDs, CDs and books
that would--in the colder months--quickly find their ways into
cardboard boxes and potbellied stoves. John Lanchester's "Fragrant
Harbor" is too mild a book to give off enough heat to warm a frigid
December, but for those with no more energetic ways to pass the hours
between Piz Buin and cocktails, Lanchester's novel of 20th century
Hong Kong is a harmless tonic.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Stewart, Lanchester's narrator and hero, is one of those
accidental clerks of literature: not important enough to be killed,
but not so negligible that he escapes the forces of history
altogether. Born in 1913 in rural Kent, the son of a publican, Tom
sells his share in the Plough to his brother and turns the small
bankroll into a passage to Hong Kong (which translates into English
as "fragrant harbor") to test his wanderlust and avoid a lifetime of
pulling pints.</LD>
<LD>   He falls in with a dull crowd in the second-class mess (one might
imagine a passable Agatha Christie taking shape in the upstairs
dining room), enlivened only by the arrival in Marseilles of two
nuns, one French, the other Chinese.</LD>
<TE>   To prove a bet made around the dinner table, Tom agrees to try to
learn Cantonese by the time the ship docks in Hong Kong. The real bet
lies below deck. In his understated British, teenage
son-of-a-publican kind of a way, Tom has a crush on the petite
Chinese nun, Sister Maria.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to Sister Maria, soon the boat is alive with the sound of
Chinese. Tom does, indeed, learn enough to change the shape of his
subsequent life (even though the bet is called off out of arbitrary
moral principle). It gets him a job at the Empire Hotel, which he
more or less keeps through wars with the Japanese, the Communist
Chinese and the triads turning him--on the cusp of the 1997 handing
over of Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese--into a very
wealthy bachelor.</TE>
<TE>   Sister Maria, however, takes the narrow road into the deep north,
to establish a mission among the rural poor. Every few years she
emerges in moral splendor to engage Tom in conversation:</TE>
<TE>   "Death is bigger than you, and it is that you are choosing," she
says, in warped Dickensian, at a hot crossroads in World War II. Or
later, when the Cultural Revolution on the mainland creates a flurry
of panic in the colony, she asks Tom, with some concern:</TE>
<TE>   " 'I hope you weren't caught up in demonstrations or anything like
that.'</TE>
<TE>   " 'Of course not. Just a bit of arm-waving. People waving their
little red books. Looks oddly like a Bank deposit book, doesn't it?'</TE>
<TE>   "She gently, reproachfully, tapped me on the arm with a folded-up
devotional pamphlet."</TE>
<TE>   Sister Maria, of course, is Tom's road not taken. She is by far
the most interesting event in his life (and one wonders, with a
summer sigh, why Lanchester didn't take her road into China, pen in
hand), even if their banter is reminiscent of some of the duller bits
of Leonard Woolf's memoirs. Indeed, their relationship does have
consequences and reverberations that lead up to the end of Hong
Kong's dramatic century.</TE>
<TE>   The inevitable conclusion is that Lanchester is far more attached
to his setting than to his characters. A writer raised in Hong Kong,
Lanchester presumably assembled "Fragrant Harbor" out of stories and
details mined not only from his own childhood, but from those of his
grandparents and parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Fragrant Harbor" is full of detail, from wartime internment to
the up-to-date travel itineraries of its latest generation of clerks,
the expat capitalists from the disillusioned counties of England and
the peripatetic Asian "astronauts" who pass the time zones of their
global lives shuttling from offices in Hong Kong to Sydney, London
and Ho Chi Minh City.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Lanchester's detail is disappointingly prosaic. Our first
sight of the Empire Hotel, which is to play such a large role in
Tom's fortunes, shows it to be "a lovely, cool colonial building with
ceiling fans, palms in the lobby, and a Belgian cook." Our last sight
of the city is on the ferry where, "in the cabin, three boys were
crowded together trying to watch 'The Matrix' on a portable DVD
player. All three were wearing caps with the Nike swoosh." One might
learn more about Hong Kong over a bowl of soup dumplings in
Chinatown. Even in summertime, one expects more poetry than an
adjective from Column A and a cliche from Column B.</TE>

<HD>Sometimes a Rose Is Just a Rose</HD>
<DH>PASADENA: A Novel, By David Ebershoff, Random House: 494
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PLANTE</AU>
<BD>David Plante is the author of numerous novels,
including "The Family," "The Woods," "Annunciation" and "The Age of
Terror."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clearly, the city of Pasadena is vital to David Ebershoff. His first
novel, "The Danish Girl," is set in Copenhagen, but in it the wife of
the man who becomes the Danish girl is from Pasadena. In his second
book, a collection of stories called "The Rose City," the young men
coming to terms with their attraction to other young men may live on
the East Coast, but they come from--or are about to go to--Pasadena.
It is, as one character says, "where the real history is."
Ebershoff's new novel, "Pasadena," puts that city at its center.</LD>
<LD>   The books are very different from one another. "The Danish Girl"
has a lightness, a brightness of touch that makes one think of an
operetta. The stories in "The Rose City," for all their quirky humor,
are darker in tone and more romantic, tending to give way--at times
too obviously--to unhappiness. They are like a recital of romantic
lieder. "Pasadena" is like a grand opera.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Ebershoff seems to have intended the novel to be a grand
opera by virtue of the references in it, references that lend his
story a near-Wagnerian dimension.</LD>
<TE>   A brother and sister are named Siegmund and Sieglinde. Two
incidental burros are called Tristan and Isolde. One of the main
characters thinks of depictions of Norse goddesses hanging over her
father's bed: "the breastplates, like helmets, worn by women with
long double braids." And the story is told in long aria-like
passages, at times by gossip columnist Cherry "Chatty" Nay to Andrew
Blackwood, who is keen to buy the Rancho Pasadena, a vast
orange-growing estate whose history is a concentrated history of
Southern California. Nay tells Blackwood about the principal and most
fated character of the novel, "Mr. Bruder's history is complex." It
is, and so is the telling of it.</TE>
<TE>   Central to the complexity is a triangle: the brooding Bruder;
Linda, the girl he is in love with; and Willis Poore, the owner of
the estate, who marries Linda. Almost halfway through, Blackwood asks
Bruder how it happened that, as the Rancho Pasadena belonged to
Poore, he, Bruder, managed to become its owner. Bruder, described as
withdrawn and reticent, then engages in one of the arias to tell
about himself and his relationships with Linda and Poore:</TE>
<TE>   "Let me start at the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, at the beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Whereupon he tells the story of how he and Poore, two young
Californians fighting for the Allies, find themselves together in
1918 during World War I, in France, in a beechwood forest, working in
a depot repairing camouflaged automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   For days, no automobiles come, and the two are isolated in the
forest, not knowing who is winning the war. Poore sets the depot on
fire and almost dies in the flames. Rescued by Bruder, he explains he
had a plan: to make the depot seem to have been shelled by the
Germans, which would have allowed him and Bruder to escape.</TE>
<TE>   But the results were disastrous. Grievously wounded, Poore pleads
with Bruder for water. (This scene appears set up so that Bruder,
having nothing with which to carry water from a stream, not even his
leaky boots, takes water to Poore in his mouth. Bruder recounts to
Blackwood that "with surprisingly little embarrassment we brought our
lips together," though after carrying the water for a quarter of a
mile, only spittle is left in Bruder's mouth. This suggests a
homoerotic contact, and I mention it parenthetically because it
occurs only once and raises in the reader an expectation that is more
distraction than anything else.) Fast expiring, Poore promises Bruder
anything if he would tell people he died an honorable man. Bruder
knows what he wants from Poore: He wants the Rancho Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   But he also saves Poore, an episode that is recounted almost 200
pages later, in another aria by Bruder to Blackwood. Desperate to
save Poore, Bruder goes to the stream, where he meets a man from
California named Dieter, who is selling tin cups for 5 cents, and
with this cup Bruder is able to carry water to his dying comrade, who
is taken soon thereafter to a hospital to convalesce.</TE>
<TE>   Bruder remains to guard the burned-out depot. Wandering one
evening in the forest, he encounters Dieter overlooking a young
German raping a French girl whom he had supplied, against her will,
to the German for cash. Appalled, Bruder is about to shoot
Dieter--the soldier and the girl having run away--but Dieter, to save
himself, promises him his daughter in California, and Bruder accepts.
The girl is called Sieglinde, later renamed Linda. Bruder and Poore
return to California where Bruder lives on the estate with Linda in
an out building as an agent for Poore. But Poore falls in love with
Linda and she moves to the big house, the consequences of which are
fatal to all three.</TE>
<TE>   The plot is revealed in a disjointed way to the sometimes baffled
Blackwood, who keeps asking questions to clarify. (For example, there
is the story of Sieglinde's brother Siegmund, renamed Edward, who is
perhaps killed by Bruder with a mallet, for which he goes to prison
for a time. Bruder's release from prison seems simply to end this
episode.)</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Rancho Pasadena does become Bruder's, but only
long enough for him to sell it to Blackwood, after which Bruder dies.</TE>
<TE>   The only person left of the characters directly participating in
the narrative is a daughter by Linda named Sieglinde. Blackwood,
moved by the family saga, tells Nay he might not break the estate up
into plots for houses but instead open a school for poor girls. Nay
suggests a name: The Pasadena School for Girls.</TE>
<TE>   If this review has been somewhat grudging up until now, it is
because the high ambition with which "Pasadena" is written inspires
an equally high standard for viewing it. Ebershoff must be applauded
for the grandness of his design, for grand characters, for grand
setting, and, essentially, for his grand vision of Pasadena as the
center of "real history." What does this mean? It means seeing in a
place that had previous been thought to have no past, a past that
gives a deep depth to the present, so that an old estate up for sale
seems to have dimensions far beyond its walls and grounds and orange
grove, dimensions that Ebershoff opens up in all their dramatic
expansiveness to the reader. Any grudging in the details gives way
for the admiration for the wider scope.</TE>
<TE>   And admiration gives way to even greater applause for Ebershoff
sees history as more than a recording of past events, he sees it, at
its most evocative, as myth, which is what "real history" is. I'm
again reminded of opera.</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, I was told by a friend, answering my criticism that
grand opera sometimes seemed ponderously unconvincing, that I simply
didn't understand it. I realize that he was right. I didn't, and I
gave myself up to the conventions, the contrivances, of opera, in
which history is dramatized at the deepest level: the level of myth.</TE>
<TE>   Ebershoff sometimes uses prose that fails as badly as the worst
excesses in the librettos of grand opera--" ... he felt the sucking
flush of fortune's drain, drowning his piercing but unspecific hopes
for another life"--and he has risked the most blatant of melodramatic
contrivances, but he does give "Pasadena" the real history of myth.</TE>

<LD>THE STORIES OF BREECE D'J PANCAKE</LD>
<LD>   By Breece D'J Pancake</LD>
<LD>   Back Bay Books:</LD>
<TE>   186 pp., $13.95</TE>
<TE>   Some writing comes from the ego, some from the id. Breece Pancake
is one of those writers who burst on the world with great promise,
publishing his story "Trilobites" in The Atlantic in 1977, but left
in great sorrow, shooting himself. His brief oeuvre is all id: rough
and random and sometimes irrational. It is often hard to tell whom
the main character in these stories is talking to, his dogs or his
woman (both are called "her" or "she").</TE>
<TE>   One story begins from the point of view of a possum, scurrying to
get her babies across the road. The characters are "crackers,"
low-class whites in West Virginia. Some of their values--tolerant of
sex with minors, or jokes about sex with minors, or racism--are so
distasteful. It's not a question of being PC or not PC; something
just smells bad. Women are always leaving in these stories; in fact,
there's nothing close to love as we know it. There's regret and guilt
and silence and shyness but no love. Life is hard when nothing is put
into words, and even the landscape reflects that emptiness. "The
passing of an autumn night left no mark on the patchwork blacktop."</TE>
<TE>   In his afterword, Andre Dubus III speculates that Pancake was
ashamed of his people, and it's true: He paints with the colors of
shame. Nothing is spoken; everything is ominous: "On a knoll in the
ridge, run there by the dogs, the bobcat watched, waiting for the man
to leave." We may be mean, but there's something even meaner out
there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I.</TE>
<TE>   By Stephen Dixon</TE>
<TE>   McSweeney's Books: 338 pp., $18</TE>
<TE>   The novel "I." is Stephen Dixon's Woody Allen moment. It is the
most detailed, hand-wringing, obsessive rant of a novel written by an
author so tied up in knots and so indecisive that he must be poking
fun at the whole exercise of writing. In fact, much of "I." reads
like an exercise. In one chapter, the author tries to imagine the
saddest story he possibly can and lays out its outline for the
reader. In another, the author gets twisted around like a dog on a
leash when he tries to refer to his main character, I., in the third
person.</TE>
<TE>   The first five pages of the novel, which is about a man who raises
two daughters and cares for his wife who is confined to a wheelchair,
are almost completely anonymous and impersonal. While the pace of
"I." and the playfulness with points of view are sometimes
disorienting, some moments are particularly affecting, such as the 20
pages in which a character tries to get from one room to another.
It's a moment drawn from our lives, cluttered--as they sometimes
are--with mental, emotional and physical distractions. Dixon rarely
lets his characters miss a chance to stumble, even if it's just on
the way to the medicine cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TWELVE</TE>
<TE>   By Nick McDonell</TE>
<TE>   Grove Press: 246 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   White Mike is just out of high school and postponing his first
year of college (his parents want him to go to Dartmouth). But Mike
is making too much money selling drugs to want to leave. He lives on
the Upper East Side like most of his friends. Their parents are
hardly ever around, too busy jet-setting. His friend Hunter lives
with his sad, drunken father. Hunter can hardly bear to be around
Dad.</TE>
<TE>   Mike misses his mother, who left him and then died. At his
mother's funeral, we get a brief look into Mike's soul: "You will not
be remembered if you die now," he thinks. "But you feel so
tremendously alone, because you fear that your blood is not strong or
good and your friends are few and embattled too. The world will
spiral out from underneath you, and you will find nothing to hold
onto because you are either too smart or too dumb to find God."</TE>
<TE>   But because most of the kids are so busy being tough, it's hard,
as in real life, to tell what they feel. Mike doesn't do drugs
himself but seems to feel no remorse and no fear, despite the murders
and drive-bys in neighborhoods less fragrant than the ones he and his
friends call home. He's had a fixation with Samurai for years and
loves to read Nietzsche; violent videos are almost beside the point.
"Twelve" builds, thinly, without layering, to a party that is bad
from beginning to end. A 16-year-old has sex with a pusher to get the
drug Twelve for the party. Mike happens on them, and the pusher
starts shooting. Many children die.</TE>
<TE>   Nick McDonell's "Twelve" has a mentorless feel, like something
that percolated from his experiences and came out fresh, with little
editing. It is a fragile voice, the voice of an author who will
forever be digging out of a hole, from which he hopes to see and
describe the sky.</TE>

<LD>RIVER THIEVES</LD>
<LD>   By Michael Crummey</LD>
<LD>   Houghton Mifflin: 352 pp., $24</LD>
<TE>   "The cemetery ground was hard as flint and the dead were salted
with chopped ice in their coffins and kept in a storage room at the
fort until graves could be dug in the spring." In Michael Crummey's
first novel, the harsh details of Newfoundland life in the early
1800s strive toward lyricism: They're the stanzas around which
Crummey organizes this mini-saga of John Peyton and his father and
their dealings with the indigenous Beothuks, volatile "Red Indians"
famed for painting their bodies the menacing color of blood.</TE>
<TE>   Within this slowly emerging tale, another story unfolds: of the
Peytons and their enigmatic housekeeper, Cassie, a woman as devoted
to the works of Shakespeare as she is to her own privacy. With this
domestic tableau, Crummey, a native Newfoundlander, gives us a taste
of the contingency that ruled colonial life with an iron fist: The
Peytons' is a make-do household, devoid of a mother, in which it's
unclear whether John's father and Cassie are lovers. Similarly, the
official policy toward the Beothuks shifts according to changing
tides of pragmatism, eventually bringing a captured Indian woman into
the Peytons' home.</TE>
<TE>   There's a thick aura of melancholy here, as it becomes
increasingly clear that the Beothuks' days are numbered and that the
colonists can only blunder in their attempts to variously subdue,
make friends with or eradicate the Indians. Hopelessness grows across
"River Thieves" like ice crystals on a window. And if this grim,
stubbornly disjointed book proceeds with glacial aloofness, it's all
the more noble and mysterious for it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HALF IN LOVE</TE>
<TE>   By Maile Meloy</TE>
<TE>   Scribner: 192 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   In "A Stakes Horse," the closing story in this impressive debut
collection set mostly in the contemporary West, a woman named Addy
confronts the sobering possibility that local thoroughbred races
might actually be fixed. Addy's horse, Rocky, is jockeyed by her
ex-husband, whose responses to her suspicions are as impenetrable as
the racetrack mystery she suddenly needs to solve: "The fastest
doesn't always win .... Anything can happen out there."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout these bite-size stories, Maile Meloy has a flair for
making uncertainty vivid, for providing oblique answers in the form
of startling enigmas and for making the improbable seem palpably
real. "Ranch Girl" is narrated by the daughter of a ranch foreman,
who muses about her dead-end life on the high plains: "You could
leave. Apply to grad school in Santa Cruz and live by the beach. But
none of these things seem real." In "Aqua Boulevard," a
mortality-obsessed Parisian clutches a recently run-over dog while
watching his kids cavort at a public pool: "I leaned my head against
the green glass, the warm dog still against my chest. I said thank
you for my children." And in "Tome," when the embittered client of a
Montana lawyer takes a Samoan football player hostage, the lawyer
must choose between her client and the law and manages, somehow, to
choose both.</TE>
<TE>   There's no big-sky grandeur in "Half in Love": Meloy's voice is as
unvarnished as her characters and as unadorned as a Montana hillside.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BOX CHILDREN</TE>
<TE>   By Sharon Wyse</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead: 186 pp., $18.95</TE>
<TE>   The "box children" of Sharon Wyse's assured first novel are five
minuscule dolls kept by 12-year-old Lou Ann Campbell, an avid diarist
on the verge of adolescence. In her secret daily entries (her
mother's rule is "Never write anything down because you never know
who will see it"), Lou Ann gives us glimpses of life on a sprawling
northern Texas farm during the summer of 1960 while chronicling her
family as it threatens to unravel: There's her older brother, with
whom she finds herself in a bitter feud; her indulgent father, who
has an eye for fast women; and her emotionally wrung-out mother,
pregnant again after losing five babies (whose departed souls are
represented by Lou Ann's doll collection).</TE>
<TE>   But as "The Box Children" moves deeper into an unforgiving summer,
it zeroes in on Lou Ann's mother, who rules the farm like a
commandant while drinking her way through her pregnancy, terrorizes
Lou Ann with outrageously overbearing demands and finally tosses her
wayward husband out of the house. It seems that only a new RCA
Whirlpool refrigerator-freezer can assuage Mrs. Campbell, but who can
assuage Lou Ann's disintegrating childhood? Wyse's almanac of a farm
summer is an affecting mid-century "Works and Days," a pastoral ode
in which the annual harvest, for one Texas girl, reaps much more than
wheat.</TE>

<HD>Holding On and Letting Go</HD>
<DH>THE LOVELY BONES: A Novel, By Alice Sebold, Little, Brown:
330 pp., $21.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAULA L. WOODS</AU>
<BD>Paula L. Woods is the author of "Inner City Blues" and
"Stormy Weather: A Charlotte Justice Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mere whisper of their names is painful--Polly Klaas, Danielle van
Dam, Elizabeth Smart, Shanta Johnson--for they represent a parent's
unspeakable heartache and a nation's vicarious nightmare. They are
the little girls, and girls are most at risk for such mayhem. Some
eventually are found dead; others simply disappear. We read their
stories, hear the soundbites and wonder: What really happened to
these lost girls? How on Earth do their families survive the horror?
How would we bear such a tragedy in our own households? They are
questions to which we seldom find answers, turning back ultimately,
gratefully, to our happier-by-comparison lives.</LD>
<LD>   Alice Sebold, however, boldly steps into that unimaginable
territory in her first novel, "The Lovely Bones." Sebold's guide on
the journey is 14-year-old Susie Salmon--"like the fish"--who tells
us she was murdered in 1973, "before kids of all races and genders
started appearing on milk cartons ... back when people believed
things like that didn't happen."</LD>
<LD>   Susie narrates from her own personal heaven, an in-between place
where "life is a perpetual yesterday," where she gets a sax-playing
Vietnamese roommate and where her no-nonsense intake counselor,
Franny, eases Susie's self-doubts with a tart "Don't mull it over. It
does no good. You're dead and you have to accept it."</LD>
<TE>   Yet acceptance is exactly what Susie cannot find, and it is that
tension that Sebold, a resident of Long Beach and a graduate of UC
Irvine's writing program, so marvelously weaves throughout the novel.
Susie relives, in chilling detail, her encounter with her killer and
follows his movements after her murder. She longs for Ray Singh, a
boy who had a crush on her and with whom she shared an almost-kiss.
She lingers at school with her classmates, especially Ruth Connors, a
girl she barely knew in life who happened to be standing in her path
when her "soul shrieked past Earth." But most of all, Susie hovers
heavily over the lives of her family, anxiously watching her father
become obsessed with finding her killer, her mother's slow withdrawal
from her family and marriage, her younger sister's desperate attempts
at toughness, her baby brother's lonely confusion.</TE>
<TE>   At times Susie's yearning for the living is so visceral, so acute,
that she tries to reach out to them and succeeds: casting her image
into a pile of broken glass, communicating with her brother, making a
life-changing appearance to Ruth and Ray. At other times, she is a
cosmic witness to their pain and anguish, trapped in her inability to
be neither on Earth nor in heaven as surely as the ships are trapped
in her father's glass bottles or her beloved penguin is imprisoned in
its perfect snow globe world.</TE>
<TE>   Susie's poignant observations of the living and the chronicle of
her own afterlife make "The Lovely Bones" a strange and beautiful
amalgam of novelistic styles. At times, when Susie recounts the
actions of her killer, the novel reads like a thriller, sweeping us
along as we see the killer's dreams, feel his overwhelming longings
to kill again, experience her father and sister's obsession with
linking him to the crime. Yet at other times it is a shattering
family drama, the tale of four survivors broken by unspeakable horror
who learn to knit their grief and anger into new connections,
"sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often
magnificent." And, yet again, it is an oddly affecting coming-of-age
novel, the story of a girl who travels from the land of the living,
through the in-between space of her personal heaven, to a "wide wide
Heaven" where she can finally let go, "hold the world without me in
it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, letting go is a leitmotif of "The Lovely Bones," one that
Sebold evokes with a sly inventiveness and lyrical power that are
deeply moving and ultimately redemptive. With a well-balanced mix of
heavenly humor, Earthbound suspense and keen observation of both
sides of Susie's in-between, Sebold teaches us much about living and
dying, holding on and letting go, as messy and imperfect and
beautiful as the processes can be--and has created a novel that is
painfully fine and accomplished, one which readers will have their
own difficulties relinquishing, long after the last page is turned.</TE>

<LD>More than any other punk subgenre or scene, emo is defined almost
completely by the listener. It has also moved through at least three
generations--an '80s scene led by Rites of Spring, Fugazi, Moss Icon,
Heroin, et al; a '90s successor marked by Seattle grunge-oriented
Sunny Day Real Estate; and now a millennial pop-punk incarnation.</LD>
<LD>   These albums are generally regarded as landmarks:</LD>
<LD>   1. Dashboard Confessional, "The Places You Have Come to Fear the
Most" (Vagrant). One-man band Chris Carrabba changed the whole idea
of emo with his gut-wrenching solo guitar screeds on the much-cited
album "The Swiss Army Romance."</LD>
<TE>   2. The Promise Ring, "Very Emergency" (Jade Tree). This group has
changed direction on its new Epitaph album, "Wood/Water," but the
chiming, tortured "Very Emergency" is a perfect example of emo-punk.</TE>
<TE>   3. Saves the Day, "Stay What You Are" (Vagrant). This new album
has been called a sellout by hard-core emomaniacs but isn't a huge
shift from the band's aptly titled emo masterwork, "Through Being
Cool."</TE>
<TE>   4. Jimmy Eat World, "Jimmy Eat World" (DreamWorks). The difference
between Jimmy Eat World and, say, Blink-182 has shrunk markedly on
this new album, but new emo fans can't help but love the
radio-friendly singles "Sweetness" and "The Middle."</TE>
<TE>   5. The Get-Up Kids, "Something to Write Home About" (Vagrant).
Like the Promise Ring, the Kids have changed their sound
significantly since this 1999 album was hailed as God's gift to emo,
leaving listeners a bit confused over their new (and better) "On a
Wire."</TE>
<TE>   6. At the Drive-In, "Relationship of Command" (Virgin). ATDI broke
up after this 2000 album, spinning off two new bands, Sparta and the
Mars Volta. This album and the "El Gran Orgo" EP were faves of the
genre.</TE>
<TE>   7. Juliana Theory, "Emotion Is Dead" (Tooth &amp; Nail ). Brad Detar's
seriously earnest lyrics made 1999's "Understand This Is a Dream" a
guitar-punk classic, but he really hit his emo stride on new tunes
such as "If I Told You This Was Killing Me, Would You Stop?"</TE>
<TE>   8. Pedro the Lion, "Control" (Jade Tree). Seattle's Pedro the Lion
(a.k.a. David Bazan) turns down a notch from his popular emo work
"Winners Never Quit," with ruminations on extramarital sex and
vanity.</TE>
<TE>   9. Further Seems Forever, "The Moon Is Down" (Tooth &amp; Nail). This
is the former band of Dashboard Confessional's Chris Carrabba,
driving his lyrical fixations on the pain of heartbreak with the
heavy emotional weight of a full rock band.</TE>
<TE>   10. Various artists, "The Emo Diaries," Volumes 1-8 (Deep Elm).
Besides featuring new emo stars such as Jimmy Eat World in earlier
incarnations, this 1997-2002 series pounds away at exactly what is
emotional about emo, with titles including "I Guess This Is Goodbye,"
"The Silence in My Heart" and "Me Against the World."</TE>

<DH>At 22, American Ballet Theatre's Michele Wiles has the
technical skills. Now she must master the drama.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At 16, Michele Wiles, willowy, blond and physically gifted, won a
gold medal. But no endorsement deals for cereal or athletic gear
followed because Wiles was competing in the world of ballet, where
leaping higher, faster and stronger is best appreciated when it can
be harnessed in the service of art, not commerce. Nevertheless, her
win, in Varna, Bulgaria, made her someone to watch. It's hard not to
watch a dancer who starts with Wiles' basic ingredients--long limbs
that seem to float into high realms (she's 5 foot 8), impressive
turns and a gift for balancing that often elicits gasps.</LD>
<LD>   But technical prowess, sometimes dismissed as an ability to do
tricks, doesn't impress everyone. A critic in Toronto, where the
22-year-old Wiles, now an American Ballet Theatre soloist, recently
won the Erik Bruhn Prize, called her "a technical monster," and she
wasn't being complimentary. The New York Times' Jennifer Dunning
offered a kinder appraisal after Wiles' debut as Medora, the main
maiden-in-distress in ABT's "Le Corsaire" last month at the Met.
Wiles appears as Medora in the company's upcoming engagement at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. "There is no one quite like Michele
Wiles," Dunning wrote, "for big, easy dancing that is inherently
classical but has the freedom and intensity of a horse bolting onto
the course."</LD>
<TE>   Dunning noted that Wiles started the ballet tentatively before
"coming into her own" in the third act, an assessment with which
Wiles agrees. "I was a little timid at first," she says by phone from
a Lincoln Center office between rehearsals. "It was my first big
thing onstage, and I was freaking out. But by the next time I did it,
I felt more relaxed, and I could let go more."</TE>
<TE>   "Letting go" is one of the major themes surfacing in Wiles' life
these days, as her career suddenly shifts into high gear. Having
joined ABT's second-unit Studio Company in 1997, she became a member
of the main company's corps the next year, then was promoted to
soloist in 2000. ABT artistic director Kevin McKenzie says "letting
go," or sinking into roles with dramatic effusion, is one of the keys
to taking competition-winning skills to the next level in principal
roles. "When I first saw Michele in the Studio Company and then in
the corps," McKenzie says from his offices at ABT, "it was easy to
see she had a wonderful facility, wonderful proportions, a lovely
training. But she had to grow into it--it was all in there, but it
was hard for her to open up at first. And you can't force someone to
grow up; you have to see that the time is right and provide them with
the right experiences."</TE>
<TE>   Wiles had competed before, at events in Japan and in Paris, in
1996, but McKenzie says he didn't know that when he chose her to
represent ABT for the Bruhn competition. Such experience, he says,
guarantees only that you have nerves of steel, not that you'll be the
best dancer. But McKenzie had already started to trust Wiles with a
few principal roles--in Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" and
"Prodigal Son"--and he suspected that working on an emotionally
demanding pas de deux like the one from Kenneth MacMillan's "Manon"
for the Toronto competition would be just the thing to push her to
"the next step." He wasn't disappointed. After wowing the audience
with regal exactitude in the demanding pas de deux "Grand Pas
Classique," with partner David Hallberg, Wiles impressed the judges
enough in "Manon" to win the competition (the male winner was
Friedemann Vogel of the Stuttgart Ballet).</TE>
<TE>   "I felt so proud, my God," McKenzie says with enthusiasm. "It was
like watching a flower blossom. I saw things that I hadn't seen
before, a little more of who Michele was and a glimmer of who she's
going to be--a really open, strong, feminine presence."</TE>
<TE>   "It was very cool," is the way Wiles puts it, after winning the
small Bruhn Prize sculpture and about $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   Like her dancing, Wiles voice is very youthful, appealingly
assured yet somewhat reserved, as if she wants each word to be
correctly placed. She has to be coaxed to talk about what has changed
since that moment. For one thing, she's danced the star turn Rose
Adagio from "Sleeping Beauty" on a mixed ABT program, and got the
"Corsaire" lead, both opportunities having come up when principal
dancer Irina Dvorovenko was injured. When replacing a principal,
Wiles has the option to move into a star dressing room, but so far
has felt comfortable at her usual place in the soloists' room, "where
all my stuff is," she says. The support of everyone in the
company--and her family and boyfriend, who attended her debut
performance as Medora--makes her feel grounded. And there have been
exciting perks she didn't expect, like her photo next to a "Pick of
the Week" recommendation in New York's Time Out magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Is this a "star is born" scenario? Not exactly, her silence and a
laugh seem to say, but she admits she's started to get autograph
requests and she gets invited to more company parties, where patrons
suddenly want to know all about her. "I guess people are noticing me
a lot more," she says. "They're taking another look, maybe."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, Wiles has always been singled out, almost from her
first days in dance class, at age 3, in Baltimore. Her mother took
jazz, so that's what Wiles started with, and for a while, the goal
was to become a Rockette. Wiles took ballet only to improve her jazz
dancing and soon got into the regional dance competition circuit,
winning some prizes right away.</TE>
<TE>   But after seeing the Royal Ballet's "Swan Lake" when she was 10,
everything became secondary to ballet.</TE>
<TE>   She studied for six years at the Kirov Academy, a Russian-run
outpost in Washington, D.C., where her technical facility and regal
line were nurtured and rewarded. Her parents at first had concerns
about the academy--it is funded by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church and isn't formally affiliated with its namesake
company in St. Petersburg--but Wiles says no Moonie overtones were
evident when she was there.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like Russian training is the best in the world," Wiles
says. "It really made me strong, but it wasn't until I did Balanchine
at ABT that I worked on petit allegro"--small-scale, rapid
footwork--"which I needed. The tempos are only half as fast in
Russia." Her teachers at the Kirov Academy suggested the competition
route. Although Wiles calls her experience at most of them "extremely
stressful," she enjoyed the less-pressured atmosphere of the Bruhn
gathering, where five young couples from prominent ballet companies
competed on only one evening. "We were all in companies already," she
says. "There weren't any parents or coaches hovering. It was more
like a gala performance, and we enjoyed getting to talk to each
other."</TE>
<TE>   Like most ballet dancers, who are promoted and cast at the will of
an artistic director, Wiles doesn't know how quickly the next
promotion will come or what principal roles she'll get to dance.
McKenzie says it all depends on timing--the opportunities that arise
and how quickly an individual artist develops. "The route from corps
to principal could take just a year for someone, or seven years for
another person," he says. "There's no standard amount of time."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to performing Medora in "Corsaire," Wiles is
rehearsing Myrta, Queen of the Wilis, in "Giselle," a prominent but
secondary role she's done in the past; and, as far as she knows,
she'll continue to dance soloist roles in "Swan Lake" (in the pas de
trois and as one of the Big Swans). But she has her eyes on the
prize--the coveted dual role of Odette and Odile in that ballet,
which she considers the height of ballerina ambition. Is she the kind
of dancer who would lobby for a part?</TE>
<TE>   "Some people might do that, but I wasn't raised that way," she
says. "At the Kirov Academy, no one went to the office and asked for
parts; we just waited for the director to notice us or think we were
talented enough."</TE>
<TE>   Not that that's all she did. From the time she started dancing,
she would spend hours in the studio by herself, after the day's
schoolwork and ballet classes were over. "No one ever had to tell me
to practice," she says. "I'd do a floor barre by myself or stretch,
and run through my dances, or whatever we'd learned in class that
day. That was my favorite time, in the studio alone."</TE>
<TE>   Now she spends less energy honing technical skills and more time
thinking about her next frontier--interpretation. She has just
started spending an hour before each performance visualizing a role
in her head and imagining the details of steps and dramatic nuance.
She returns to the idea of "letting go" and "falling into a role,"
when she talks about some important advice she received from ABT and
Bolshoi star Nina Ananiashvili.</TE>
<TE>   "She was so generous with her comments," Wiles says. "She told me
that in Russia, there is a saying, that you have to have a cold mind
and a warm heart. Which is true, I think. When you dance, you have to
be calm and collected in your head, but you have to give your whole
heart."</TE>
<TE>   Is she impatient for fame and fortune? "Not really," she says
slowly. "For now, I think it's going just perfectly."</TE>

<LD>Billy Joel records--A story in the June 30 Sunday Calendar about the
singer-songwriter and Twyla Tharp was unclear about album release
dates. "The Stranger" was released in 1977, but its four hit singles
came out in 1978. Joel wrote the songs for his "An Innocent Man"
album in 1982, but it was released in 1983.</LD>

<DH>Politics have obscured the artistic questions about a Cuban
son</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to sending out copies of new albums to critics, Dita
Sullivan doesn't believe in taking any chances. She has an enemies
list of writers who, she assumes, are biased against the work of New
York-based singer-songwriter Juan-Carlos Formell, son of the famed
founder of Havana's Los Van Van, Juan Formell.</LD>
<LD>   So Sullivan, who is married to the younger Formell, recently
issued her marketing marching orders about who should get review
copies of her husband's latest CD, "Las Calles del Paraiso," which
she co-produced.</LD>
<LD>   And who should not. She blacklisted anybody who had written
favorably about Los Van Van, her father-in-law's revered dance band.</LD>
<TE>   "Don't go to them," she instructed the publicist promoting her
husband's album, "because these people are not our friends."</TE>
<TE>   I know this because Sullivan told me during a recent phone
conversation, or rather, confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan's strange strategy may be hard to fathom, unless you
understand the politics of Cuban music. Hers is a convoluted, Cold
War rationale that puts the world, including music lovers, into two
camps: pro-Castro and anti-Castro.</TE>
<TE>   Her premise: Those who support the Cuban revolution do not support
music made by Cuban exiles, like her husband. Instead, they are
misguided fans of progressive bands that have emerged since the
revolution, including Los Van Van, founded 10 years after Castro took
power.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, she reasons, if you love Formell Sr. in Havana, you'll hate
Formell Jr. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan knows I'm a hard-core Vanvanero, a nickname for the
band's obsessed fans. In January, I wrote a lengthy article about
Formell Sr., tracing the extraordinary history of Los Van Van during
the past 33 years.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said she was outraged at what she considered dismissive
treatment of Juan Formell's father, Francisco, who helped raise his
grandson, now her husband. She thought the article should have
explained that the patriarch was a talented musician and arranger in
his own right.</TE>
<TE>   "He was an important figure in pre-Castro Cuba," Sullivan said,
"which is why he had to be disparaged."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Francisco Formell got short shrift in the piece. But it
was due to space, not politics. It's absurd to think a critic would
"disparage" Cuban musicians simply because they predate the
revolution. That would require dissing the greats like Beny More,
Orquesta Aragon, Arsenio Rodriguez and Israel "Cachao" Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   My bias in Cuban music is the same as it is in other genres. I
favor fresh, original work over tried-and-true formulas. The fact is
that modern Cuban musicians, nurtured under the Socialist education
system, are far more creative than their exiled counterparts who got
stuck in nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   That's not politics. That's personal taste.</TE>
<TE>   Even those preferences aren't all black-and-white. I recently
raved about the latest album by Albita, the Miami-based exile who
appeared last week at the Mayan. I'm also excited about the new group
Yerba Buena, based in New York and featuring another excellent,
exiled Cuban vocalist, Xiomara Laugart.</TE>
<TE>   And who doesn't love Celia Cruz, perhaps the most famous exiled
Cuban artist? At one time, Cruz was unofficially blacklisted by Cuban
cultural authorities for her outspoken opposition to Castro's regime.
Yet even the island's hardliners have stopped playing politics with
music. Recently, Cuba's government-controlled record industry allowed
the release of a tribute album to Cruz by Haila Mompie, ex-vocalist
of Bamboleo.</TE>
<TE>   So politics aside, how good is the work of Juan Formell's son?</TE>
<TE>   You can call me a communist, but I was not impressed by his 1999
debut, "Songs From a Little Blue House." I listened to it again
recently and liked it only slightly better. It still sounds bland and
listless, but I've started to appreciate the strength in Juan-Carlos
Formell's songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   If only he didn't insist on singing.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, he inherited his father's voice, thin and anemic.
But junior doesn't have his dad's good sense to leave the vocals to
the experts. Formell Sr., who handles the occasional Van Van tune
when it suits his limited range, is known for hiring Cuba's most
impressive soneros, or improvisational singers. His son should do the
same.</TE>
<TE>   Formell Jr. has claimed publicly that he was blackballed as an
artist by the Cuban government, partly because he practiced yoga. But
his critics say he's lucky he didn't get arrested for impersonating a
superstar on an island brimming with outstanding, undiscovered
talent.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., people are free to make mediocre records. They're
also free to blame their enemies if they fail. But then how does an
artist grow if all critiques are dismissed as politically motivated?</TE>
<TE>   Juan-Carlos Formell's new album is stronger than his first, with
livelier arrangements and tighter playing. Plus, his songwriting is
getting richer, as in the heartwarming "Loco Juan" and the lively
"Camina Como Comico," a tribute to pioneering '60s percussionist
Pedro Izquierdo, a.k.a. Pello El Afrokan, that is far too short.</TE>
<TE>   The album still has some lame selections, but the good ones make
you yearn for a singer who could do them justice. My advice to the
young Formell: Forget about politics and trying to prove you can do
it all. It's your ego, not your enemies, that is holding back your
music.</TE>

<HD>'Hey, Now!' Was Then-- This Is Now</HD>
<DH>Jeffrey Tambor shed 'Larry Sanders' and weight. Along the
way, he landed a film lead and a series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No, Jeffrey Tambor isn't suffering from the Peter Pan syndrome, but
it's important to him to keep his inner child alive and well. In
fact, what he admired most about Hank Kingsley, the bombastic
sidekick and talk show announcer he played on the acclaimed HBO
series "The Larry Sanders Show," was the character's childlike
sensibility.</LD>
<LD>   "I understood this character," Tambor said during a recent
interview. "People called him a buffoon and a jerk, and I would say,
'I don't think you are quite getting this guy. He was a consummate
professional as an announcer and a complete amateur in life. He had a
childlike quality that I loved and I am determined never to lose. I
will never get so serious about things.' "</LD>
<LD>   Jill Clayburgh, who plays his love interest in the romantic comedy
"Never Again," opening Friday, has noticed that Tambor's spirit has
lightened over the past few years. "He is a lighter person, an easier
person to get to know," she says. "When I first knew him, he was
harder to approach. His life is in a wonderful place."</LD>
<TE>   Tambor, 57, seems very much at ease during lunch at a bustling
Santa Monica Italian restaurant. In October, he married his longtime
girlfriend, Kasia Ostlun, who plays the College Girl in "Never
Again." He's excited about the film, which marks the character
actor's first leading-man role. And he has a new TV series, "That Was
Then," premiering this fall on ABC.</TE>
<TE>   He also looks years younger, having recently lost 60 pounds. With
his close-cropped beard and svelte figure, Tambor jokes that people
are mistaking him for self-help guru Dr. Phil. During lunch, no one
seems to recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   "I come from a Hungarian Russian background," he says while
perusing the menu for something low-fat. "Their way of showing love
was food and the amount of food. The motto of our family was 'Did you
eat? What did you eat? When are you going to eat?' It's that European
culture. My lunches in school were enormous--mine were in shopping
bags!"</TE>
<TE>   Tambor decided it was time to lose weight after a friend
congratulated him on his performance in the 2000 film "Pollock." "He
said, 'It is just marvelous. And so risk-taking.' I said, 'What do
you mean by that?' He said, 'To wear all that padding.' I said, 'Oh
no. I have to cut down.' "</TE>
<TE>   The heftier Tambor is on view in "Never Again," which was filmed
in 2000, and written and directed by Eric Schaeffer ("If Lucy Fell").
Tambor plays Christopher, a fiftysomething exterminator-jazz musician
who, because of his bad luck with women, begins to think he is
gay--that is, until middle-aged divorcee Grace (Clayburgh) comes into
his life. Both, though, had decided they would "never again" fall in
love. When the two start to become romantically involved, their fears
of intimacy and commitment almost put the kibosh on their
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Making the low-budget comedy was a consuming experience for
Tambor. "This was a beautifully difficult, hilariously complex shoot
where you had 30 setups a day and you were just going all the time,"
he says. "I remember Eric saying, 'Are you ready for this? Do you
really know what you are getting into?' I really didn't. It was
tough."</TE>
<TE>   Tambor is happy that in our youth-obsessed culture, "Never Again"
dares to show "people of a certain age becoming sexy." Although
neither Tambor nor Clayburgh does any nude scenes, there are several
lovemaking scenes and frank sexual dialogue between the two.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that old and young really respond to it," he says. "With
its humor and its irreverence and drama, it gets to the point of that
whole prospect of 'never again.' It is ridiculous. First of all, they
are in love and they are afraid. And he's a jerk. Love is right in
front of him, and all he has to do is cooperate."</TE>
<TE>   Clayburgh recalls that although there wasn't much improvisation on
the set, Tambor would add "flavor" or a line to certain scenes. "He's
sort of a comic genius and a wonderful actor. I think he just comes
off so vulnerable, and he's so sweet and adorable, which is not how
we think of him."</TE>
<TE>   Although he hasn't done any stage work in several years, Tambor
does teach two advanced acting classes at the Santa Monica Playhouse.
Clayburgh was recently one of his students. "He burrows into people
and gets to the nugget," she says. "He's got an incredible nose for
what's going on with someone in a scene or what's holding them. He's
very instinctive."</TE>
<TE>   Tambor finds himself learning from his students. "I don't know how
to talk about it," he says, diving into a salad. "They teach me. I
find it very informative in my growth. I love actors. I am quite
emboldened by it, and it affects my whole life. It keeps me young."</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in San Francisco, Tambor fell in love with acting
at a young age. He fondly recalls seeing Mary Martin in "South
Pacific" and "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Kismet" with Alfred Drake when
he was a youngster. "The very first play I saw was 'No Time for
Sergeants.' I believe it was with Andy Griffith. I remember hearing
the laughter, and I remember saying, 'My God, what is this?' "</TE>
<TE>   Tambor began acting classes at 12. He received his bachelor's in
theater arts from San Francisco State and his master's degree from
Wayne State University in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   His first big break came in 1977 when he appeared on Broadway in
the hit comedy "Sly Fox" with George C. Scott and Hector Elizondo.
Tambor had a small part in the play and understudied Elizondo's part.
A year later, he joined Scott and Elizondo for the Los Angeles
production.</TE>
<TE>   Scott, he says, had a profound influence on his life. "I think he
was one of our greatest actors," Tambor said. "There was something
about his dignity and integrity." He recalled Scott's generosity the
first night he went on as understudy for Elizondo. "He treated me so
beautifully. I remember on that big night, he pulled me out of the
line during the curtain call, dragged me over and shushed the
audience and said, 'This is his first time. This is his first night.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Appearing as Hank on "The Larry Sanders Show," for which he
received four Emmy nominations, was a high point in his career. "I
understood that character," he said.</TE>
<TE>   For Tambor, Kingsley was an everyman. "We are all Hank Kingsley,"
he said. "I think that's why for some reason people liked him. It
wasn't because they were laughing at him. It was because they said,
'I know the guy.' "</TE>
<TE>   He still gets fans of the show shouting "Hey, now!"--Kingsley's
trademark phrase--when they see him on the street. "I even get it
when I am in Europe. It was very big in London and in France. I have
been on a number of talk shows, and people have come up to me and
said we were right on the money. It was a pretty wise show."</TE>
<TE>   Tambor has high hopes for "That Was Then," a TV comedy-drama about
a 30-year-old man who magically returns to his high school. Tambor
plays his late father, a bookie.</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Jeff Kline said he and the two other executive
producers pursued Tambor for the series not only because they loved
him as Hank Kingsley, but also because they were impressed with his
dramatic guest turn last season as a nasty loan shark on "The
Practice." "Here is a guy who is seemingly naturally funny, but when
you need him to be a little scary or very real you can get there,"
Kline said.</TE>
<TE>   Kline recalled setting up a dinner for Tambor and Bess Armstrong,
who plays his wife in the show, and the executive producers before
they shot the pilot. "Jeffrey was like, 'I am kind of tired. I don't
like to go out and socialize.' We had to drag him to the restaurant.
But as soon as we got him there, he's in the kitchen, he's cooking
and he's delivering things to people's tables. When you first meet
him, he's a little dry and he's kind of taking you in and then boom,
as soon as it is appropriate, he turns it on and with just a look,
you are laughing on the floor."</TE>
<TE>   Tambor relies on his intuition when it comes to acting. "You do a
lot of work. You do your homework, but some of your best thoughts,
you don't know where they come from," he said. "With acting the whole
thing is get out there and do it. On 'The Larry Sanders Show' you
didn't have time to think. You just went with it, and some of the
imperfections became perfections."</TE>

<DH>Rosario Dawson's ability to play a range of characters and
ethnicities is propelling her to larger roles</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARE KLEINEDLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A heavily bearded man in his late 30s is shifting nervously on the
sidewalk outside La Conversation cafe on Los Angeles' Westside. With
a Sharpie in one hand and a few ripped-out magazine pages in the
other, he musters the courage to make his approach.</LD>
<LD>   "Um, hello ... I have this magazine, and I've gotten everyone
else's autograph and yours is the only one I don't have yet," he
stammers. His hands are shaking and his forehead is beaded with
sweat.</LD>
<LD>   The magazine is Vanity Fair's Hollywood issue, and the cover
features a handful of rising female stars including Kate Beckinsale,
Jennifer Connelly, Selma Blair and the latest object of this fan's
affections, Rosario Dawson.</LD>
<TE>   "Sure, no problem," says Dawson as she takes the pen and neatly
signs the cover. The fan then pulls out another magazine photo, but
there's just one slight problem.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I can sign it if you'd like, but that's not me! I don't who
it is, but I know it ain't me," she says, laughing. Embarrassed, the
man apologizes and hurries away.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't surprising that even to fans, Dawson isn't always
recognizable. The actress can play up any one or all of her features
to become a wide range of characters and ethnicities. Her brown skin,
huge dark eyes, hourglass figure and bee-stung lips are the result of
a diverse ethnic background: She's a self-described "mutt" with
Afro-Cuban, Puerto Rican, Native American and Irish roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I use it to my advantage. If they need me to be 'more
black' or 'more Spanish,' even though I think that's kind of stupid,
I can pull it off. In the end, it's most important that I can pull
off the character emotionally, so that should be the focus," Dawson
says. "But you know Hollywood.... Sometimes I won't get a role
because they'll think I'm not hot enough. To that, I'm like, 'Oh, I'm
sorry I don't look emaciated or starving enough for you!' " Dawson's
bravado is another of her charms.</TE>
<TE>   Although she recently turned just 23, her self-assured presence
and forward nature is that of someone who has experienced a few
things in life. When director Barry Sonnenfeld was casting for the
just-opened "Men in Black II," he needed a beautiful woman who could
hold her own beside Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson plays Laura, a pizzeria worker who witnesses the murder of
her longtime mentor and father figure. But since her friend was
actually an alien posing as a human (unbeknownst to Laura, of
course), it's a case for the Men in Black. Laura immediately charms
agent Jay (Smith), and Dawson's ability to play the tough chick with
a heart of gold with such conviction is key to the on-screen
chemistry between the two. Times critic Kenneth Turan singled out
Dawson's casting as Smith's love interest as the movie's "best idea
.... Dawson brings a warm and welcome human touch to a film that has
been needing it all along."</TE>
<TE>   "She came in the first day we were reading women, and we pretty
much decided to hire her as soon as she read," Sonnenfeld says.
"She's so exotic and has this great sort of New York attitude. But
she's so accessible; she invites the audience into the journey of the
story."</TE>
<TE>   "Men in Black II" is just one of several films Dawson has
completed in the past two years. A few weeks before the start of
production on "MIB II," she wrapped "The First $20 Million Is Always
the Hardest," penned by Jon Favreau of "Swingers," as well as "The
Adventures of Pluto Nash," playing opposite Eddie Murphy; both will
be released later this year. She also appeared in Edward Burns'
"Sidewalks of New York" and the Ethan Hawke-directed "Chelsea Walls."
Her next project? Spike Lee's "The 25th Hour" with Edward Norton and
Philip Seymour Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson got her first acting job at 15. For that gig, she was
sitting on the stoop of her Lower East Side apartment building when
photographer-cum-director Larry Clark and writer Harmony Korine
walked up to ask if she'd like to be in their first movie. The
project turned out to be the controversial "Kids," and although
Dawson had never acted a day in her life, her performance as the
naive girl who contracts AIDS from a reckless teenage boy won rave
reviews. Before "Kids," Dawson says her life as "a bratty little
tomboy" was just like that of any other teenager: dysfunctional
family, school, boredom, baby-sitting.</TE>
<TE>   The actress describes her life matter-of-factly, never seeking
sympathy for her turbulent upbringing in one of New York's toughest
neighborhoods. Regarding her parents' recent divorce, she says she's
happy for them and that there's no need to dwell on the subject.
"What's the point? If they didn't get a divorce I would have been
traumatized, and them getting divorced was a little traumatizing, but
why focus on that?"</TE>
<TE>   Her mother and father have an amicable relationship (and still
live in the same building where Dawson also keeps an apartment), and
she is very close to her younger brother, Clay, 18. When she speaks
of her brother, she gushes with words like "beautiful" and
"brilliant" and phrases like "I'm totally in love with my brother!"
When that remark is compared with Angelina Jolie's Oscar-speech
reference, she laughs it off.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I already get the comparisons because of the ... lips and
everything, so whatever," she says. "And I really do think my brother
is the most amazing person, and I'd fight for him to the death of
me."</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's fierce loyalty and levelheadedness are certain to come in
handy as her profile continues to rise. With her ability to play a
range of diverse characters convincingly, industry admirers say the
actress may redefine female-lead stereotypes.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's the new American girl because she represents
everybody," says actress Rachael Leigh Cook, 22, who co-starred with
Dawson in "Josie and the Pussycats." "Rosario will be able to do her
own thing. She's not going to be pegged as a certain type of
woman.... She's what we're all going to look like in 30 years.
Actually, I hope sooner, because I'd love to look like her."</TE>
<TE>   "Pluto Nash" director Ron Underwood, 47, echoes Cook's sentiments.
"I think she is going to be in great demand, and she isn't going to
be limited. Rosario has a lot of soul, and she's very connected. She
will have the opportunity to do a wide range of roles," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the young actress prefers to take things day by day.
She's just as excited about reading a new novel as she is about her
next film role, and Dawson asserts that she will have time to do it
all and maintain her sense of self.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll check in with myself once in a while, see how I'm doing. I
have to do that because if I don't, I'll just lose all sense of
reality," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good to have time-outs, to keep in check because otherwise
I'll probably freak myself out, and there's just too many experiences
I would really like to have."</TE>

<HD>All Politics, Little Art</HD>
<DH>Review* By insisting that only works with an agenda matter,
the new edition of Documenta is dull indeed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>KASSEL, Germany</DL>
<LD>Next to a defunct brewery in a scruffy neighborhood of this mid-size
city, two young, architecturally minded American artists who go by
the name Simparch have  constructed a bit of hip-hop nirvana inside a
ramshackle warehouse.</LD>
<LD>   From above, the duo's sensuous, scooped-out skateboarding arena,
built from plywood and lumber, resembles a kidney-shaped swimming
pool in a suburban backyard. It attracts daring local kids on wheels,
pumped up by music blasting from big speakers at the end of the room.
The skaters glide and swoop and sometimes crash, maneuvering their
boards with varying degrees of finesse.</LD>
<LD>   From below, where skaters (and gawkers) enter to climb the spiral
stairs leading up to the suave arena, things look different. The
swollen, bolted-and-ribbed form of the bowl resembles the hull of a
handmade boat--a contemporary Noah's ark, perhaps, promising refuge
from an imminent deluge. Suburban escape performs an artful collision
with urban grit. The work is thrilling.</LD>
<TE>   Simparch is short for Simple Architecture--a witty turn on
SCI-Arc, an acronym for the Southern California Institute of
Architecture--and its New Mexican duo of Steve Badgett and Matthew
Lynch titled the irresistible work "Free Basin." Even without the
puns, it provides one of the few instances of blissful enchantment in
the huge but mostly joyless exhibition Documenta 11, whose several
hundred works fill four big buildings and several outdoor sites.</TE>
<TE>   The show has a savvy if familiar political agenda: Relocate art
from dominant Euro-American views of the world and toward an
authentically global perspective. Its 116 participants hail from 45
countries. The only continent not represented is penguin-filled
Antarctica.</TE>
<TE>   The show's migratory effect is perhaps most succinctly captured in
the fantastic, visionary architectural model of a Pop-psychedelic
Manhattan made by Bodys Isek Kingelez, an artist from the Democratic
Republic of Congo. Using brightly painted wood, colored paper and
gleaming plastic, Kingelez invents a post-Sept. 11 urban landscape
and sets it 1,000 years into the future. (The World Trade Center is
replaced with not two but three soaring towers.) Kingelez turns
long-established tables. This is the United States conceived as an
exotic projection of African imagination--Brightest America.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't the presence of a political agenda, though, that is the
problem with this installment of Documenta, which has been mounted
every four or five years since 1955 and, since a landmark
presentation in 1972, has earned a reputation as the most significant
international survey of contemporary art in the world. It's the near
absence of diversity that grates. Through sheer numbers, Documenta
insists that one kind of art--political art--is most significant
today.</TE>
<TE>   Documenta was born of politics. Conceived by local professors
Arnold Bode and Werner Haftmann for Kassel's Museum
Fridericianum--still the central site of the sprawling
exhibition--Documenta is the now-grown child of war.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 50 years ago, hosting a big international survey of the
avant-garde was a means to definitively repudiate Germany's Nazi
denunciation of Modern art as "degenerate." Documenta 1 showed the
history of European painting and sculpture since 1900. The gesture
carried unusual weight because only two other such international
surveys then existed in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Venice Biennale, founded in 1895, had been modeled on the
format of a world's fair, with national pavilions displaying their
countries' art (rather than their industrial products) in a frankly
competitive way. The show's strong nationalist emphasis was useful to
Italy, which had struggled for centuries with unification of its
fragmented regions.</TE>
<TE>   The following year, American industrialist and philanthropist
Andrew Carnegie established an international art exhibition in
Pittsburgh. Carnegie was a social Darwinist. A principal motive of
the show was the education of the common citizen, lifting him "higher
and higher in the scale of being," as the benefactor put it. For an
expansive nation then on the brink of what would come to be called
"the American Century," the politics fueling that presentation were
blunt.</TE>
<TE>   When Bode and Haftmann launched Documenta, the epochal Second
World War had been over for just a decade, and an aggressive Cold War
had replaced it. While the U.S. Congress was busy adding the words
"under God" to the Pledge of Allegiance, in order to distinguish the
republic from the godless Soviets, so the German professors were
organizing an art exhibition that would do the same with free
expression. Kassel's geographic position smack in the center of the
country meant that in 1955, Documenta's audacious celebration of
artistic freedom was taking place just a few miles down the road from
the closed border with East Germany. They could practically hear the
lively party going on over the fence.</TE>
<TE>   So politics are embedded in Documenta. Loosely defined, politics
are simply the means by which people organize their social
relationships with one another. That's why you'd be hard-pressed to
find a work of art that doesn't have political content, whether it's
Simparch's urban-suburban playing field or Kingelez's visionary
architecture.</TE>
<TE>   Documenta 11, however, doesn't merely express political content.
It also strongly favors art with political subject matter. The
relatively few exceptions to the implicit rule seem like ants at a
picnic. Bode and Haftmann are likely spinning in their graves, as the
mandate for appropriate political subject matter in art is just what
the Nazis and the Soviets had in common.</TE>
<TE>   Torture, labor exploitation, distribution of health care,
immigration issues, repression of women, transnational economics,
terrorism, government conspiracy, private ownership of public
resources, strip-mining--the focus of the first Documenta of the 21st
century is political subjects associated with globalization. Its
artistic director is writer and poet Okwui Enwezor, 38, a Nigerian
from a privileged background who attended boarding school in Britain,
studied political science at Jersey City State College and has lived
in New York for 20 years. Enwezor worked with an international
committee of six advisors.</TE>
<TE>   The curator's reasonable position is that after centuries of
colonial expansion by the West, an agonizing central story of the
20th century was the decolonization of the world. Today, after the
end of the Cold War, post-colonial aspirations collide with the
inexorable forces of globalization.</TE>
<TE>   In the Age of Enron--and WorldCom, Global Crossing, Tyco
International and on and on--Americans are beginning to taste the
destructive chaos caused by a willful abandonment of regulatory
oversight. A chief function of democratic government is the
mitigation of inequities inevitably caused by capitalism. But what
happens in a global economy, where corporations supersede nations?
What becomes of the social mechanisms for relief?</TE>
<TE>   And what happens when the transnational corporation is not an
economic entity, but a political one? The terrorist organization Al
Qaeda, for example. President Bush reiterates that the nation is at
war with Al Qaeda, even though the constitutional requirement for a
congressional declaration of war has not been met. There is no
sovereign nation against which to move. Civil liberties have begun to
crack.</TE>
<TE>   Documenta 11 chronicles the acute anxieties of the unfolding
globalization phenomenon. Sometimes it's riveting.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish filmmaker Kutlug Ataman spent hours videotaping an
eccentric woman who owns Britain's national collection of Hippeastrum
bulbs--a.k.a. amaryllis, African lilies with showy blossoms. She
tends to them in her flower-packed west London flat. On four screens
arranged in a cubic configuration, "The Four Seasons of Veronica
Read" unfolds simultaneously, a dizzying ode to the inexplicable
wonders of obsession with exotic beauty.</TE>
<TE>   Asymptote, a New York-based architectural office, has built a
remarkable room that is shaped by mirrored projections of computer
data streams. The environment abruptly shifts back and forth between
physical and virtual realities.</TE>
<TE>   The Ivory Coast's Frederic Bruly Bouabre has spent a half century
making an archive of pictographic drawings in ballpoint ink and
colored pencil on small sheets of cardboard. Hundreds of them from a
1982-1994 series called "Knowledge of the World" line one gallery's
walls, charting everything from green beans to Barbara Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, the presentation is unnerving. Los Angeles artist
Raymond Pettibon is known for installations built from scads of
drawings that, not unlike Bouabre's, record an array of swirling
thoughts on everything from baseball to crime. In a small, tall room
with the aura of a castle keep, Pettibon has splattered the walls
(and windows) with a mad, post-9/11 rant. The targets of his
drawing-tantrum range from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, whose
remarkable performance in the days after the terrorist attacks
obscured the reality of a dismal eight-year reign in office, to the
Olympic nattering of sportscaster Bob Costas.</TE>
<TE>   Some stalwarts of the international exhibition scene also make
appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Nonagenarian Louise Bourgeois shows sagging, soft sculptures of
tormented human body parts displayed in steel cages. (They
inadvertently mirror how you feel in the show.) Canadian photographer
Jeff Wall has given paradoxical visual form to Ralph Ellison's 1952
literary masterpiece, "The Invisible Man," by showing a figure
sequestered in a cave-like room whose ceiling is covered with
hundreds of light bulbs. (Hanging like stalactites, they allow the
invisible African American to see himself in the surrounding
darkness.) Some 4,000 drawings by Germany's Hanne Darboven--drawings
that oscillate between abstract repetition and musical
notation--create "Minimalist wallpaper" in three rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Most often, though, the art ranges somewhere between tedious and
sophomoric. The latter includes pretty color photographs by South
Africa's Kendall Geers showing security company signs in upscale
residential neighborhoods. (Privilege is a prison--get it?) They have
all the visual punch and insight of an undergraduate art school
project.</TE>
<TE>   In a melodramatic installation by Cuba's Tania Bruguerra, banks of
light suddenly blind viewers who enter a darkened room, where the
sound of a rifle repeatedly being cocked mingles with the
militaristic thud of marching boots. Something about being an art
tourist on the international circuit makes this theatrical experience
a bit less scary than a ride through Disneyland's Pirates of the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Tedium is perhaps most common. Aesthetically arid research
projects into assorted social and political dilemmas around the world
are omnipresent, often in the form of films, videos and photographs
with text. I spent two days going through the exhibition, but it
would take at least twice that long to see all the documentaries and
read all the numbing dissertations.</TE>
<TE>   One unintended effect of the emphasis on political subject matter
is to flatten out the show. The threat of homogenized experience is
already a hazard of global capitalism. Who knew a global Documenta
would so readily succumb? Under a rubric of diversity it's
monotonous--one kind of art, over and over.</TE>
<TE>   A delicate work like Japanese Conceptual artist On Kawara's "One
Million Years," which features a handsome young couple in a glass
booth doing a somber reading of sequential dates that make up the
million-year title, gets squashed. No wonder coming upon Simparch's
lively, cheeky skateboarding rink feels so elating.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition's most telling statistic is that of 116 artists, 10
are painters or sculptors. All the rest work with cameras, computers,
installations or performance. Some, like Benin's Georges Adeagbo, who
makes installations with found objects and printed matter, refuse to
consider themselves artists. (I concur.) Since the early 1990s, a
compelling resurgence of painting and sculpture has been afoot, but
Documenta ignores it.</TE>
<TE>   Partly it's a matter of form. For international spectacles, the
art world has split. On one side are the "ennials"--the biennial,
triennial, quadrennial and "quintennial" extravaganzas that now clog
the exhibition calendar. More than four dozen have joined Venice, the
Carnegie International and Documenta, in cities as far-flung as
Sydney, Istanbul, Sao Paolo, Kwangju and Johannesburg.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side are the raucous commercial art fairs--Basel,
Cologne, Paris, Madrid, Chicago, Miami--which have likewise
proliferated, principally in Europe and the U.S. That's where the
paintings and sculptures are.</TE>
<TE>   The "ennials" didn't invent installation art, video or
photography, but they have entrenched them as overbearing elements.
Why? Expediency. It can take a dozen paintings to fill a gallery, but
a single installation or video projection will cover the same
acreage. And it's harder to ship monumental sculpture to Pittsburgh
or South Korea than to mail a DVD.</TE>
<TE>   Further evidence of the split is evident a short train ride from
Documenta. In Frankfurt, the concurrent biennial exhibition called
Manifesta 4 includes only installation and camera art. Manifesta, a
recently invented equivalent to the Whitney Biennial of American Art,
surveys new work by younger Europeans--here, 37 artists with an
average age of 32--and is organized for a different city each time.
(Frankfurt was chosen for 2002 specifically to piggyback on the
proximity of Documenta.) After more than 700 studio visits, a team of
three curators from Russia, Spain and France chose no painters or
sculptors.</TE>
<TE>   Artists understandably make art to take advantage of available
opportunities. Manifesta, born as a means to fuse the European Union
culturally, is doing for art what the Euro has done for
currency--made it uniform, interchangeable and bland.</TE>
<TE>   The Frankfurt show is scattered in several venues, including an
old, unused government office building--the former Bureau of
Drainage, an inadvertent but fairly accurate commentary on the
quality of the art inside. Files on artists not chosen are displayed
as part of the show. This Manifesta Archive is a kind of bureaucrats'
version of the 19th century Salon des Refuses, which progressive
Parisian artists demanded as a contrarian badge of honor for having
been turned away by the academy's official salon.</TE>
<TE>   Work is also scattered in public sites around the city, such as
Ibon Aranberri's small pavilion by the river. Its severe Bauhaus form
is decorated with a clumsy reproduction of Picasso's "Guernica."
(Aranberri lives in Bilbao, Spain, just up the road from the Basque
town immortalized by Picasso.) A German Modernist pavilion ornamented
with a reproduction of a canvas memorializing the destruction of a
town by Nazi aircraft is wry and knowing. But the showy calculation
doesn't add much to the ambience of the Frankfurt riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   The most engaging piece in this thin exhibition is Hans Schabus'
"Forlorn," a homemade plywood boat with wheels, reminiscent of
something by Chris Burden, which Schabus proudly sailed through an
ancient sewer beneath Vienna. A video of the wretched journey plays
inside a dark chamber, entered through a gigantic version of a
guitar's sound hole. It's a romantic voyage down an urban River Styx.</TE>
<TE>   Most everything else is derivative and forgettable, such as Mans
Wrange's "The Average Citizen Lobbying Project." Using statistical
profiles of the typical European resident, Wrange found a woman
(named Marianne) who filled the bill, made her blank-eyed portrait
bust in plaster and bronze, and worked to insert her comments on life
into TV shows and political speeches. An ostensible critique of
focus-group society, this standard Conceptual fare seems unaware that
it describes the uniform condition of much art today. It offers
little to look at and less to think about.</TE>
<TE>   You get the sense that at least one Manifesta artist recognizes
the tired dubiousness of it all. Marc Bijl's sly, painted mural of a
revolutionary flag, "Never Surrender," forms the backdrop for a
stripped and rusted automobile that's shoved up against it on a
museum plaza. Scrawled on the wall--in carefully artful script--is
the legend "Class War Now!" Filled with sand, the ruined vehicle
doubles as an outsized ashtray, becoming an amusing urban amenity
courtesy of your friendly EU artist.</TE>
<TE>   The global proliferation of "ennials" provides an odd context for
Documenta's dull courting of global issues. Its near-total
elimination of painting and sculpture betrays an obvious ideological
purpose, because painting and sculpture are mediums associated with
modern European and American art. To relocate contemporary,
post-colonial art on a global field, they must be suppressed.</TE>
<TE>   But this agenda founders on the Scylla of mediocrity and the
Charybdis of anachronism. Given the meager painting and sculpture
selected--like the rest of the exhibition, it's largely restricted to
political subject matter--there's no sense that anyone on the
curatorial team has any capacity to deal productively with either
medium, especially painting.</TE>
<TE>   Even an important artist like the 80-year-old American Leon Golub,
whose scraped pictures of leering thugs and barking dogs are painted
on un-stretched canvas suggestive of flayed skin, seems beaten down
by the relentless context.</TE>
<TE>   The show also feels old-fashioned. Art, signifier of Western
authority, is replaced by "cultural production," which is anything
made by anybody, individually or collectively. Dismantling the
established authority of a traditional medium such as painting was a
project undertaken--with considerable success--more than 30 years
ago. Doing it again, even for different ends, is a bureaucratic
gaffe--the creation of a Department of Aesthetic Redundancy
Department.</TE>
<TE>   For how could Documenta be regarded as anything less than a
plausible definition of establishment authority itself? The "most
significant show of its kind in the world" has a huge, $11-million
budget supplied by government and corporate sponsors (Deutsche
Telekom, Volkswagen, etc.), an expected half-million visitors during
its 100 days and a reliable role as a powerful economic engine for
tourism to the rather dowdy city of Kassel.</TE>
<TE>   More evidence of anachronism comes in the show's bleakest
statistic: Well over two-thirds of the invited participants are men.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Schjeldahl, art critic for the New Yorker, coined the term
"festivalism" for art found in "ennials" like Documenta and
Manifesta. Mixing entertainment and soft-core politics, festivalism
"favors works that don't demand contemplation but invite, in passing,
consumption of interesting--just not too interesting--spectacles."
True enough. But I always thought a festival was supposed to overflow
with artful celebration, charged exuberance and erotic joy. How did
the art establishment get so dull?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rock band the Promise Ring and its singer, Davey von Bohlen, have a
problem. They really, really don't like the term "emo." Shorthand for
"emotional," it's been used to describe the highly personal nature of
their post-punk songs, many of which deal in excruciating detail with
interpersonal relationships, love and longing.</LD>
<LD>   There was a time when the band could live with that. But now emo
is becoming a defined pop sound, a genre, a movement populated by
such bands as Jimmy Eat World, Dashboard Confessional, the Get-Up
Kids, Saves the Day. There is a code, a uniform, even emo tours.
There is a record-label feeding frenzy. There is the smell of money.
It's the new grunge, and that's not where the Promise Ring wants to
lead its fans.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that's awful, wrong, bad, destructive, totally opposing
everything that I believe in, and insulting," says Von Bohlen, 26,
with a laugh. Von Bohlen has a sense of humor, and the Promise Ring
wants success, like any band. But one of the reasons to play music
that's come to be described as emo was to emote freely and not
conform to mass trends. Von Bohlen can already feel the hot breath of
the marketers closing in.</LD>
<TE>   "If you limit your interests to a genre, you are joining a social
scene, not enjoying art," he says. "I don't want to be part of a
social scene. I want to be in a band and make music. Hopefully, the
two are different."</TE>
<TE>   This kind of posturing is, in its own way, totally emo. Bands have
despised the term "emo" since it was first coined in the early '80s,
even while acknowledging that it did vaguely describe their sound:
guitar dynamics that explored both the softs and louds of punk in the
same song with--most important--brutally confessional and even
self-loathing lyrics. It also vaguely described the die-hard fans,
largely ironic outsiders: Think of the two girls in the film "Ghost
World."</TE>
<TE>   Emo songs are mostly about pain. As a body, they are like
middle-of-the-night journal entries exposing insecurity and suicidal
thoughts. Or wanting the girl and even getting the girl, then going
down under a swarm of conflicts and self-inflicted wounds and losing
the girl to mopey confusion. In punk terms, emo is for crybabies and
losers. It's math rock with smarty-pants lyrics. At best, it's rock
for antiheroes. Calling something "emo" has always been something of
an insult.</TE>
<TE>   But now, the bands say, emo means conformity. Maybe we should all
be a little concerned about what exactly that means. Whose emotions
will be validated? What kind of pain will outsell the others? What
Von Bohlen is saying, along with a lot of other bands, is that the
bigger emo gets, the harder it is to play. Would anyone really want
to enable a stadium full of weeping geeks?</TE>
<TE>   And I can't tell if it's me or the meat that's rotting ...</TE>
<TE>   and I think that I see that big blade coming</TE>
<TE>   to slice open a great canyon through the earth</TE>
<TE>   so you can watch me disappear.</TE>
<TE>   --"All I'm Losing Is Me" by Saves the Day</TE>
<TE>   Emo flagship band Saves the Day's new album, "Stay What You Are"
on Vagrant Records, is pretty much a constant stream of this kind of
soul purge, all of it delivered by singer Chris Conley in long,
run-on lines that extend the litany of pain. It's a stone bummer for
anyone who believes in the transformative power of rock music. For
longtime Saves the Day fans, however, it's not nearly bummer enough.
The new album has been savaged by emo fans on the Internet as a pop
sellout.</TE>
<TE>   But now emo is pop. Time magazine called it "anti-pop" for its
unheroic stance, but new fans hear hooks and sing-along choruses just
like any other radio-friendly music. "It's crazy, none of us ever
thought in a million years we'd be playing a place like Madison
Square Garden," says Saves the Day bassist Eben D'Amico, 22. "But
we're not trying to do some kind of underground punk thing anymore.
We want to be true to the music."</TE>
<TE>   Their inclusion on a spring U.S. tour with Green Day and Blink-182
was mostly about their indie-pop sound, which is growing in
popularity. Most of the bands now associated with emo came out of
'90s indie rock and see themselves as part of the lineage of punk,
but they seem to have more to do with the Foo Fighters than Fugazi.
The result is a crossover from small but rabidly loyal indie
followings to radio hits.</TE>
<TE>   Saves the Day's breakthrough album, "Through Being Cool," sold
more than 100,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan data, and its
new one is already nearing 170,000, a huge number for a teeny indie
label such as Vagrant. The year-old album by Dashboard Confessional,
"The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most," has already sold more
than 220,000 copies. MTV wanted a piece of emo so badly it bent its
own rules, recently making Dashboard the first non-platinum act ever
invited to tape its hallowed "Unplugged" show.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy Eat World is the champion of this alleged scene, with "The
Middle" and "Sweetness" in heavy rotation on modern rock stations.
Its 2001 eponymous DreamWorks release has sold 620,000 copies and is
rising fast.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an industry use for the term 'emo' now, and it's just
being used to sell music," says Ian Mackaye, 40, co-leader of
Washington, D.C., punk band Fugazi, one of the first tagged as emo.
"Why don't one of you examine the roots of what it is--media hype?"</TE>
<TE>   Rites of Spring, a D.C. hard-core punk band fronted by guitarist
Guy Picciotto before he joined Mackaye in Fugazi, is generally
acknowledged as the root of all emo. The quartet released one album,
1985's "End on End," a raw and cosmic howl mostly about
relationships. It came out at a time when new territory was being
defined by terms such as "metal-core" or "horror-core."</TE>
<TE>   Rites of Spring was more emotional or sensitive to personal
issues, so they were "emo-core."</TE>
<TE>   "But when you used that term, it was a tease!" Mackaye says with a
laugh. "It was pejorative, sort of an insult."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time emo has been reborn. Mackaye points to
an early-'90s New York-Connecticut emo scene whose bands were
outrageously aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "Guys were screaming, rolling around on the floor," Mackaye says.
"I was at least impressed by their level of commitment. I've seen
only one of the newer crop of emo bands, and the strongest impression
was only how reserved they were. I don't want to put anyone down, but
this is like anti-emotional."</TE>
<TE>   That change from frantic to feng shui came about five years ago,
when emo suddenly meant indie band Sunny Day Real Estate. The
emphasis on intelligent, soul-scraping lyrics was still there, but
Sunny Day's milder temperament nixed the buzz saw guitars, and emo
lost its "core."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, in terms of sound, emo has almost ceased to mean anything
at all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any idea what emo is," says Rich Egan, 33, president
and chief executive of Vagrant Records. The L.A. label is home to a
lot of what is considered emo, including Dashboard Confessional,
Get-Up Kids, Saves the Day and Hot Rod Circuit. Egan says it was
never a marketing ploy.</TE>
<TE>   "We never went out and said, 'Let's corner the market on emo.' My
favorite band is the Replacements, so I tend to sign bands that sound
like them, punk bands that write serious songs with poppy punk
hooks.... The Replacements were called post-punk. Maybe that's what
this is."</TE>
<TE>   "Emo is whatever you want it to be," says Jim Adkins, 26, singer
and principal songwriter for Jimmy Eat World. "My band plays
guitar-based, melodic rock.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, Weezer has just been written up as an emo band," Adkins
snorts. "That boggles my mind. They were a very successful band in
1996, and no journalist was writing about emo-core then! Emo is just
what people have been calling the up-and-coming bands that haven't
quite broken into the mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   Thematically, the distance from Jimmy Eat World to Weezer is not
that big a stretch. Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo's well-publicized
search for validation and social acceptance has made him a poster boy
for the Emo Nation.</TE>
<TE>   Musically, however, Weezer's pop is big and bright and digestible.
The only line of connection with emo is pain. Emo can be anything
because anything can be about pain. Indeed, in the case of Chris
Carrabba, who performs solo under the name Dashboard Confessional,
emo means an almost absurdly personal brand of folk music.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting onstage strumming an acoustic guitar, he flings his
tormented love songs into the crowd like he's ripping pages out of
his diary before jumping off of a building. His devoted fans eat this
up, howling the lyrics in sheer delight. For these emo fans, feeling
bad has never felt so good.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just in England, and a journalist said to us, 'It's so
cool to see two emo bands like Hot Rod Circuit and the Cave-Ins
touring together," says Andy Jackson, 27, singer for Hot Rod Circuit.
"I was like, 'What? The Cave-Ins sound like Pink Floyd!' "</TE>
<TE>   Pink Floyd, emo? Why not? Where does the pain begin or end?
Wouldn't Billy Corgan be emo? How about Courtney Love? P.O.D. or
Korn? In the midst of the hype, some bands like the Promise Ring are
looking to distance themselves from the pack. The Get-Up Kids, who've
been closely identified with the movement for years, took their new
album, "On a Wire," in a decidedly lighter, more jangle-pop
direction. Predictably, they've been lambasted by fans for getting
too cute and mellow. They may also miss out on the summer's biggest
fashion trend.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a scene out there, relating to the word 'emo,'
" Jackson says. "They buy the glasses, the thrift store jeans and
T-shirt, the Converse sneakers." Buddy Holly-style eyeglasses, long
the symbol of geekdom, are also now de rigueur.</TE>
<TE>   All signs indicate that this summer's tours, including the Promise
Ring-Jimmy Eat World bill, will definitely see the triumphant return
of geek chic.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, there are short-term benefits to being part of a
movement, but there are also long-term drawbacks," says Vagrant's
Egan. "As soon as a sound becomes the flavor of the day, the clock is
ticking on it, in terms of its relevance to the listener."</TE>
<TE>   Emo fans, however, aren't buying this. They're hungry for more and
deeper descriptions of What's Wrong With Me, and emo seems poised to
deliver. Maybe teens have been barraged with so many issues that this
has become the easiest thing to relate to.</TE>
<TE>   "Emo, to me, has more intelligent lyrics about love or
relationships," says Brandon Hughes, 17, a student at El Camino Real
High School in Woodland Hills. "But it's also just great music. Saves
the Day may be singing about depression or anorexia, but it'll be the
most upbeat, poppy sound you've ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, this is a pop phenomenon built around a few hit songs
that are providing a thinking kid's alternative to mainstream rock.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking for music with more substance now," says
Hughes. "We're getting out of jock rock like Limp Bizkit or Korn, the
materialistic Hollywood bands. You can relate to the lyrics of
Dashboard Confessional. All you ever see is Fred Durst at the Playboy
Mansion. Well, I've never been to the Playboy Mansion. But I have
broken up with a girl before, and when you're going through something
like that, Dashboard is what you listen to."</TE>

<LD>So Robert Hilburn is telling us that rock has a new passion
("Remember Rock?," June 30). I am 46 and have seen this cycle before.
The only thing stale about rock 'n' roll is how record companies do
business. They and radio people will give you what they want you to
have. Hilburn writes about their product. The bands get a push on TV
(the Strokes on "Saturday Night Live") and in major newspapers and
magazines.</LD>
<LD>   Despite what Albert Hammond Jr. of the Strokes says, they are
trying to be famous and make money at what they do as well. Members
of every one of these bands will be close to 30 in five years. Not
what you would call youth-oriented.</LD>
<LD>   Hilburn writes, "The buzz is definitely building." It sure is,
because the people who run the well-oiled machine want it to build.
Just ask Clive Davis.</LD>

<TE>   How appropriate that the same edition of Calendar that features a
Hilburn cover story on new bands (the White Stripes, Hives, etc.)
should also contain his negative review of the fine new Oasis album.</TE>
<TE>   In a few years, he'll be dishing out similar reviews to these
currently new bands, claiming they've lost their passion, while
praising the future flavors of the month. Hilburn is the one who has
lost something, although being trendy is certainly not it.</TE>

<TE>   Hilburn made it all the way to the second paragraph before pulling
up a reference to Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, two war horses who had
some truly great records 30 years ago. Enough with the war stories.</TE>
<TE>   I stopped reading articles by Hilburn years ago due to his
continual use of dated references to old rock bands and music.</TE>
<TE>   Should every club review have a reference to the Fillmore? In the
Food section, is every recipe compared to one from "The Joy of
Cooking"? Or every restaurant to Ma Maison? Would you want to read
that section if they were?</TE>
<TE>   I have all of my old vinyl, and I saw dozens of great performances
in the '60s and '70s, but if I can see a band at the El Rey without
comparing it to the Stones and Stevie Wonder at Winterland (Tuesday,
June 6, 1972, $5, no refunds), then so can Hilburn.</TE>

<LD>Lynn Smith's story on Tripod Captioned Films for the hearing-impaired
was very informative on this large, underserved segment of the
population ("Words Can Describe It," May 26).</LD>
<LD>   While Tripod is able to make some captioned films available for
screenings, at DTS we have developed a new product for theaters, the
DTS-CSS Cinema Subtitling System, which makes it possible to provide
subtitles and captions on demand for virtually every film released.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of being etched onto the film print, subtitles or captions
are stored on a hard drive that synchronizes to the time code already
found on prints of movies shown with DTS digital sound. Properly
equipped theaters can project an overlay of the subtitles or captions
onto the screen along with the movie.</LD>
<TE>   In today's large multiplexes, it's not hard to imagine some
screens being used to show movies to people who currently never go to
the cinema.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Brian Lowry expressed the frustrations and confusions about HDTV and
its future very well ("High Definition's Middle Ground," June 30).</LD>
<LD>   I have seen HDTV demonstrated many times at industry conferences
and workshops, and look forward to the promise it brings. However, if
it turns out to be another empty promise, like the intermediary we
must now be forced to live with known as "digital" television, I'll
pass. Unless you watch a lot of premium channels such as HBO, you're
not getting anything that's truly digital delivery anyway.</LD>
<LD>   What is really aggravating is the quality. Most digital channels
use such high compression rates that the artifacting (or digital
"blocky" look) is totally unacceptable. Recently while watching
"Match Game" on the Game Show Network, Charles Nelson Reilly looked
like an alien--his head forming and deforming digitally every time he
moved.</LD>
<TE>   Movies are just as bad. Heaven forbid a film should have a dark
scene in it because everything goes blurry. Lets hope that HDTV gets
it right.</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL J. SAUL</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faced with many of the same questions Lowry addressed, I took the
HDTV plunge last year and don't regret it for a moment, despite the
cost and confusing information given out by television set retailers.
Like most people contemplating a purchase of this kind, I used the
Internet heavily, where I gained almost all of the information I
needed to make an informed decision on my purchase (size of set, type
of set-top decoder, sources of HDTV programming, etc.).</TE>
<TE>   I achieved HDTV nirvana only after upgrading in stages. Now, 50%
of our viewing is of high-definition content, courtesy of a DirecTV
subscription (bare-bones) and a $25 Radio Shack roof antenna.</TE>
<TE>   So take my advice and complete your setup. There's still time to
catch college football on CBS HDTV this fall.</TE>

<LD>Both the cover story by Nicolai Ouroussoff ("Drafting a Career," June
23) and subsequent letter by Jeff Softley (June 30) miss the point
about Michael Maltzan's architecture.</LD>
<LD>   As an art educator, I have been a part-time user of the Inner-City
Arts facility and a full-time user of the Feldman-Horn facility. I
was present in both instances from the planning stages through
occupation. In both cases, the promise of the young architect's
career is manifest in the internal functions of the buildings as
reflected by the exterior aspect.</LD>
<LD>   By this sense of architecture, as something to be experienced as
well as observed, the two aforementioned art education facilities are
the best I have ever worked in. In both cases, Maltzan has taken the
essential elements and principles of the art education process and
given them voice in physical spaces.</LD>
<TE>   My favorite approach to the Feldman-Horn art complex presents the
building massed to the eye like blocks of clay on the sculptor's
table, ready for a new day's round of creation. Maltzan's career is
like these pregnant forms, full of great promise, some of it already
achieved.</TE>

<LD>In "The Sum of All Fears," I thought the emotional impact of the
nuclear whitewash scenes in Baltimore was diminished by the film's
tidy ending ("A Fearful Sum Recalculated," by Kenneth Turan, June
23). Odd how this history-shaping event barely consumed its main
characters, whose courageous actions prevented the world from ending.</LD>
<LD>   Wrapping up, Jack Ryan and new fiancee picnic pleasantly outside
the White House, some 50 miles from ground zero, swapping diplomatic
winks with the Ruskies.</LD>

dead are not even mentioned, seemingly forgotten. Oh well to what
ends well.</LD>

<HD>The Sins of Irish Fathers</HD>
<DH>Just as 'Perdition's' gangsters can't ignore Catholicism,
real-life towns can't escape the mobsters' shadow</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first big scene in the "The Godfather" takes place at a wedding.
In "Road to Perdition," it's a wake.</LD>
<LD>   Therein lies a signal of how director Sam Mendes' new film,
starring Tom Hanks as an Irish American hit man in Depression-era
Illinois, will offer a variation on Hollywood's long fascination with
gangsters. The gangsters in "Road to Perdition" are primarily Irish,
not Italian, and their moral failings are dramatized in a fatalistic
universe dominated by the Irish Catholic Church.</LD>
<LD>   "I think the Catholicism in the film is crucial," says Mendes, the
Oscar-winning director of "American Beauty," "because it gives these
people a structure that tells them it's still possible to be saved."</LD>
<TE>   Paul Newman is cast uncharacteristically as a vicious Irish
godfather, Rooney, who rules a criminal empire in rural Illinois in
1931. The story focuses on his most trusted henchman and surrogate
son, Michael Sullivan (the Hanks character), depicted as a once-poor
immigrant who took up with Rooney when it was the only work he could
get. But Sullivan is not proud of his violent job and tries to keep
it a secret from his two young sons.</TE>
<TE>   From "Public Enemy" to "GoodFellas" movies have developed their
own gangster mythology--and like most mythology it's one that is only
loosely related to reality. "Road to Perdition" relies upon this
mythology but gives it a different twist, one that's rooted in a
religion in which even the priests are part of the gang.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola scenario for "The
Godfather," "Road to Perdition," which opens Friday, is an
immigrant's story, but one with a bleaker mood and perhaps more
preoccupation with the wages of sin. In a scene between Rooney and
Sullivan, set in a church, the older man tells the younger one, "No
one in this room is going to heaven," an acknowledgment that both are
damned for the choices they have made.</TE>
<TE>   But bad as they are, Mendes takes pains to show these two main
characters attending Mass and observing church rituals because "their
faith saves them from sinking into the moral chaos" represented by
another hit man, a mercenary sociopath played by Jude Law who is
hired to kill Sullivan and one of his sons. "How do you marry an
absolute morality with personal morality?" is the way Mendes poses
the film's thematic question.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a very strong Catholic sensibility there," says David
Self, the screenwriter who adapted the film from a graphic novel by
Max Allan Collins (with illustrations by Richard Piers Rayner).
"Michael Sullivan is a man haunted by his religion."</TE>
<TE>   Whether actual hit men think this much about spiritual issues is
open to question (and if they do, whether they are more apt to be
Irish than Italians or Jews), but "Road to Perdition" is a reminder
that based on a closer look at American history, the Irish have been
underrepresented in the cinematic gangster parade.</TE>
<TE>   The films "Miller's Crossing," "State of Grace" and "The Cotton
Club" all dealt with Irish criminals, and director Martin Scorsese
will also include early Irish American gangs in mid-19th century New
York in the upcoming "Gangs of New York." But Italians have long held
top billing in the American iconography of organized crime, from
"Scarface" and "The Untouchables" to "The Godfather" and "The
Sopranos," with Jews ("Once Upon a Time in America," "Bugsy," "Billy
Bathgate") a distant second.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big secret that the Irish have been involved in this
stuff," Self says, "but it hasn't been explored because they didn't
produce as many self-promoting charismatic figures."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Haller, a professor of history and criminal justice at Temple
University in Philadelphia who for 30 years has been studying the
rise of illegal enterprise in the United States, says, "By the 1890s,
the Irish dominated gambling in the U.S.," having brought the custom
of betting on horse races with them from the old country. Bootlegging
followed and blossomed during Prohibition.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important that they're Irish," Mendes says of his
main characters, "because something happens to a community that
arrives on these shores with nothing, and their national identity
provides them with sustenance."</TE>
<TE>   Although "Road to Perdition" is only loosely based on real events,
the idea that a crime syndicate in western Illinois during the
Depression was run by an Irish gang "would not be surprising to
anyone familiar with the underworld at that time," Haller says,
pointing to the prominence of the Irish in 20th century Chicago
politics. "It was common for a guy who was the major bookmaker in an
area to run for city council."</TE>
<TE>   Haller meanwhile attributes the rise of the Sicilian mafia
mythology not only to the influence of "The Godfather," but also to
"scholarship in the late 1960s that suggested Italian dominance in
crime," which he believes was flawed, stemming from earlier
congressional hearings that focused too narrowly on Italians and
subsequent FBI wiretap reports that did much the same. He even argues
that Al Capone was overrated.</TE>
<TE>   "Capone was never a member of a mafia-like group, and he didn't
even dominate crime in Chicago," Haller says. "But he did hold press
conferences."</TE>
<TE>   Collins, the author who has made a career out of writing
fact-based graphic crime novels set in the 1930s and '40s Midwest,
believes the Irish weren't considered as colorful as the Italian
mobsters of that era. "Maybe the Irish assimilated sooner," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Collins was doing research for one of his Nate Heller detective
books when he came across the story of a real Irish godfather named
John Looney whose base of operations was Rock Island, Ill., 20 miles
east of Collins' home in Muscatine, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "Road to Perdition" is the Looney legend writ large as the
framework that holds the tale of Michael Sullivan, whom Collins says
he largely invented.</TE>
<TE>   "Having written a lot about Italian gangsters, I thought, why not
write about this other slice of society?" Collins says. "But the
bottom line is that it's a dark side of the American dream story:
immigrants being denied the American dream but going after it anyway.
And I wanted to explore the notion Americans have that you can be a
bad man at work and a good man at home."</TE>
<TE>   Current leaders of the Irish American community in the so-called
Quad Cities area of eastern Iowa and western Illinois, where Looney
once roamed, acknowledge the legend of the former crime boss but are
not eager to resurrect it. Pat Burke, president of the St. Patrick's
Society of Quad Cities U.S.A. says, "That's why our society is not
championing the movie."</TE>
<TE>   The exact location of the town where the Looney-turned-Rooney
character lives is not specified in the film, only shown to be many
miles of farmland removed from Chicago, where Sullivan travels to
seek help from Capone lieutenant Frank Nitti, played by Stanley
Tucci. "Looney was a real bad character," says Bill Fisher, a retired
captain in the Moline, Iowa, Police Department and chairman of Irish
Heritage Day in nearby Davenport, "but as far as I know, he was the
only one," meaning the only prominent Irish gangster from the area
that anyone can remember.</TE>
<TE>   Told from the point of view of Sullivan's 12-year-son (played by
Tyler Hoechlin) remembering a six-week period when he went on the lam
with his gangland father, "Road to Perdition" is "an Irish tragedy,"
in the words of screenwriter Self, "with elements of redemption and
confession" blended with the violent acts that unfold.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an Irish Catholic guy myself," says Self, who adds that he
wanted to tell "an everyman story about organized crime, rather than
the story of the top family guy." Hence the focus on the henchman
rather than the king.</TE>
<TE>   Hanks and Newman both portray killers who have made pacts with the
devil, but the henchman's heartfelt struggle to save his son from a
life like his own becomes the movie's narrative thrust.</TE>
<TE>   In the process, some of the darkness that hangs over Hanks'
character is lifted. "You make the good bad guy the best man in his
world" is how Collins looks at the redeeming qualities in his
Catholic antihero.</TE>
<TE>   This view is unlikely to assuage Lynn Cutter-Gronke, the
great-granddaughter of a Looney lieutenant named Anthony Billburg,
whom she believes to be the role model for Michael Sullivan.
Cutter-Gronke, who grew up partially in Rock Island and now lives in
Torrance, has not seen "Road to Perdition" but through the years has
taken a dim view of Hollywood's tendency to glamorize gangsters.</TE>
<TE>   "They were horrible people!" Cutter-Gronke says about Looney and
his gang. "There's a difference between victims in Hollywood movies
and victims in real life. People can talk about stuff like this who
haven't lived through it, but we lived it, we know it, it affected
our whole family for generations--the shame, the fear, the
alcoholism. The town never really recovered."</TE>
<TE>   Her great-grandfather, who ran afoul of Looney, she says, when he
tried to leave the gang and form his own empire, staged an ambush in
an alley in 1922 in an effort to kill Looney. It failed, killing
Looney's son Connor instead. Billburg went to prison for 12 years and
later died of tuberculosis, as did Looney.</TE>
<TE>   Collins says he is unaware of Billburg or his great-granddaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "There were several lieutenants that Looney betrayed," the author
says. "But there was no one like Sullivan. I don't like to use real
historical figures in a dishonest fashion. I was infuriated by 'The
Untouchables' movie where [screenwriter] David Mamet had Frank Nitti
thrown off a building by Elliot Ness--something that never happened."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Collins had used the real Billburg as a role model, it
would have posed an additional problem for Sam Mendes and company:
Billburg was Swedish, not Irish. Which might be welcome news at the
St. Patrick's Society of the Quad Cities U.S.A., but not anywhere
that stories are told and movies are made.</TE>

<HD>Clarifying a Vision</HD>
<DH>An idea driven by glass artist Dale Chihuly's work has led
to a museum about much more</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TACOMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>This is glass country and Dale Chihuly is king. The renowned artist
whose prodigious energy and charisma spawned the Northwest's art
glass culture actually lives in nearby Seattle, but he was born in
Tacoma and the city wants everyone to know it.</LD>
<LD>   At the hub of Tacoma's downtown redevelopment district, the
federal courthouse boasts a Chihuly chandelier in its dome and
displays his glass sculpture in massive arched windows. Next door,
the Tacoma Art Museum is building a new home that will include a
permanent exhibition space for its collection of Chihuly glass. Not
to be left out, the Washington State History Museum--on the opposite
side of the courthouse--offers another view of the artist: an
exhibition from his vast collection of American Indian trade
blankets.</LD>
<TE>   And now comes the Bridge of Glass--a $6.8-million, publicly funded
pedestrian bridge that opened Saturday. Billed as a gateway to
Tacoma, the 500-foot-long, 20-foot-wide bridge spans Interstate 705,
connecting Pacific Avenue's burgeoning cultural corridor to Tacoma's
waterfront. Not incidentally, it's also an outdoor gallery of
Chihuly's work, featuring two 40-foot towers of giant blue crystals,
a walk-through pavilion with a ceiling of 1,500 glass "Seaforms" and
a wall of 109 Venetian-style vessels displayed on glass-encased
shelves. Arthur Andersson, of Andersson-Wise Architects in Austin,
Texas, designed the bridge in collaboration with Chihuly.</TE>
<TE>   Spectacular as the bridge may be, it leads to a much bigger temple
of glass--which also opened Saturday--conceived as the anchor of an
ambitious plan to convert deserted industrial property along Thea
Foss Waterway into a thriving cultural and residential center. Here's
the surprise: The new institution was originally envisioned as a
Chihuly-driven glass production and exhibition center, but it has
opened with a much broader mission.</TE>
<TE>   Neither named for Chihuly nor devoted to his work, the Museum of
Glass: International Center for Contemporary Art is "dedicated to the
presentation and interpretation of contemporary art with a sustained
concentration on the medium of glass." Designed by Canadian architect
Arthur Erickson, the $48-million building--built on city land, mostly
with private funds--is an exhibition and education center intended to
involve artists of many different persuasions.</TE>
<TE>   A 90-foot-tall tilted cone, sheathed in diamond shapes of
stainless steel, towers above the three-story building. Inspired by
the timber industry's wood burners that once dotted the Northwest's
landscape, the cone has already conferred landmark status on the new
museum. Inside is a glass production center, known to the trade as a
hot shop, that's open to the public during the museum's regular
hours. The drama of blowing and shaping molten glass will probably
make the hot shop the museum's biggest draw, but the museum will
offer a variety of programs designed to attract a broad audience and
keep people coming back.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting artists, including some who have no previous experience
with glass, will work with experienced glass-makers in the hot
shop--in full public view. Exhibitions in the galleries will present
works made entirely of glass along with pieces that incorporate glass
with other materials or have a vague relationship to the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I view glass as just one more medium in the spectrum of
contemporary art," says Josi Callan, who became the museum's director
in January 2000, after nine years as head of the San Jose Museum of
Art. "We don't use the terms 'glass artist' or 'glass art.' My
feeling is that you are either an artist or you aren't, and what you
make is either art or it isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Talks about establishing some sort of center for glass began seven
years ago and architectural plans were underway before Callan arrived
in Tacoma, but she has played a leading role in shaping the mission
and the physical plant. "As the project went on, the name changed
several times, old people left and new people came in. It just
evolved, as these things do," she says. "Dale decided he didn't want
his name on a museum, which was probably the right thing for him and
for this institution."</TE>
<TE>   Chihuly puts it this way: "As I got more involved in the bridge, I
got less involved with the museum."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he will be completely absent from the museum. As hot shop
director Charlie Parriott notes, Chihuly will be the first visiting
artist. But the fact that the museum is not a one-man show and that
it will embrace a wide range of glass-related art reflects the museum
leaders' effort to create a cultural destination that is much more
than a regional shrine.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who walk across the bridge arrive on the roof of the
museum; those who take a glass elevator from the first-floor parking
area land on the second-floor plaza. Either way, they discover a
long, low concrete-and-glass structure that reveals itself on the
exterior as a series of ramps, grand stairways and shallow ponds.
Along the way are five large outdoor artworks.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Ben Tre's "Water Forest," a permanent installation funded
by the city, features two concentric circles of bronze and glass
cylinders filled with water that perpetually overflows and runs down
the sides into drains. The idea was to "take water from the waterway
and bring it to you" in a piece that "creates a sense of community,"
says Ben Tre, who lives in Providence, R.I.</TE>
<TE>   The other outdoor pieces were commissioned by the museum as
yearlong installations. "Incidence" by Buster Simpson, who lives in
Seattle, consists of 36 panels of tempered glass, arranged as a
series of peaked structures above a rectangular pond on the rooftop
plaza. One level down, "Blackbird in a Red Sky (a.k.a. Fall of the
Blood House)" by Bay Area artist Mildred Howard is composed of a
walk-in red glass house beside a pond filled with oversize glass
apples.</TE>
<TE>   On the plaza near the museum's entrance, "Call of the Wild" by
Patrick Dougherty, also from the Bay Area, is situated on another
pond. Fashioned of twisted masses of willow branches and other wood
found near Tacoma, it is a monumental still life that pays homage to
the region's natural beauty. The largest component is a huge
pitcher-shaped enclosure that invites visitors to enter through open
doors. They can also walk into a gigantic jar, but four smaller
vessels strewn across the water must be viewed from the edge of the
pond.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to its involvement with professional artists, the
museum is committed to community outreach through projects overseen
by Susan Warner, director of education. One product of the program,
installed on an outdoor plaza, is a pair of painted wood houses
created by young women incarcerated at Remann Hall, a detention
center in Tacoma. Poetic writings on the walls of one house recount
their fears and allude to experiences that landed them in jail. The
other structure is more hopeful. "It started with the question 'What
would I be if I could transform myself?' " Warner says, and led to
musings about rebirth and change.</TE>
<TE>   With its broad plazas and a sweeping staircase that winds around
the cone, the museum has an unusually large amount of public space
that can be used for outdoor programs and artworks--or as a panoramic
viewpoint of Mt. Rainier and activities on the waterway. But there's
a lot going on inside as well.</TE>
<TE>   The 75,000-square-foot building encompasses 13,000 square feet of
gallery space--about half the size of the exhibition space at the
Museum of Contemporary Art's California Plaza facility in downtown
Los Angeles--a 180-seat theater, an experimental studio for
educational programs, a shop and a cafe. The lobby displays a
two-level mural, "The Kingdom of Glass," by Los Angeles painter
Gronk. In the hot shop, visitors can take a seat in the amphitheater,
walk around an observation deck above the furnaces or check out
different views of the ongoing action, filmed by three cameras and
projected on a big screen. The images also appear on monitors in the
lobby of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural exhibitions are "The Inner Light," a show of cast
glass sculptures and drawings by the late Czech artist Stanislav
Libensky and his widow, Jaroslava Brychtova, and "Sounds of the Inner
Eye: John Cage, Mark Tobey and Morris Graves."</TE>
<TE>   "The Inner Light," organized by the museum, is a "no-brainer" that
celebrates the achievement of "premier artists who have had more
influence on the medium of glass that anyone else in the world,"
Callan says. In sharp contrast, "Sounds of the Inner Eye," organized
by the Kunsthalle Bremen in Germany, has almost nothing to do with
glass. Instead, it explores little known connections among three
prominent artists who met and became friends in Seattle in the
mid-1930s. Although they developed distinctive styles, they all
embraced spiritual and cross-cultural influences, and wrote texts and
poems for one another's work. Also on view is "Die Falle," a
sculpture by Gregory Barsamian, who uses 3-D animation techniques and
synchronized strobe lights to create the illusion of motion.</TE>
<TE>   "What we open with is not what we are; it's just what we open
with," says curator Neil Watson. Glass will be on view most of the
time, but sometimes in subtle or surprising ways. "Glass is very
seductive," he says. "We have to go beyond that. If that's all there
is to it, it's not enough."</TE>
<TE>   Future exhibitions of works by American artists include a survey
of artists affiliated with the glass studios at Pratt Fine Arts
Center in Seattle, paintings by Deborah Oropallo and maquettes by the
late ceramic sculptor Robert Arneson. In keeping with its
international mission, the museum also plans to present glass works
by Swedish artist Bertil Vallien and "Glass of the Avant Garde: From
Vienna Secession to Bauhaus," drawn from the Torsten Brohan
collection at the National Museum of Decorative Arts in Madrid.</TE>
<TE>   "The most intriguing part of this project has been to figure out
what we wanted this place to be, to clarify the vision," Callan says.
"It was a challenge to integrate the exhibition spaces, the education
studio and the hot shop." The key was to develop the hot shop "not as
a Disneyland attraction" but as "an education center where we
translate a lot of what's happening in the galleries," she says. "The
same thing is also happening in the education studio, which is
currently designed to bring out ideas presented in the Cage, Graves
and Tobey show."</TE>
<TE>   The overarching goal of the museum, Callan says, is to make art
accessible in a program that integrates artistic, scholarly,
educational and community outreach activities. It's a balancing act,
but Callan says she never doubted that the museum would come to
fruition or open on time.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, big challenges remain. About $42 million of the $48
million project budget has been raised, and the rest is promised by
the end of the year, Callan says. About half the money has come from
local and regional sources, the rest from patrons in 37 other states
and several foreign countries. But plans for a $15-million endowment
were delayed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The museum, which
has no permanent collection, has also postponed a decision about
what, if anything, it should collect. Yet another problem is that
Tacoma has long been viewed as Seattle's poor, blue-collar relative.
The museum's marketers say their biggest challenge may be to attract
people from neighboring cities who never think of going to Tacoma.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this a time to celebrate "the people here who had a vision
of what Tacoma could be," Callan says. Tacoma Mayor Bill Baarsma
agrees. "This used to be a polluted, dirty site," he says, explaining
that "the city bought the land, cleaned it up and turned it over to
the private sector" as part of an urban renewal plan. The
inauguration of the museum and the bridge not only show the world
"where we are, but how far we've come," he says.</TE>

<DH>At LACMA, a display of photos linked only by acquisition
date poses a challenge for viewers</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY MYERS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Assembling a museum-quality collection of contemporary
photographs--one that reflects the concerns of the present in a way
that will also speak to the future--is no easy task. Reducing that
collection at any given time to one meaningful and coherent
exhibition is, no doubt, even harder.</LD>
<LD>   Judging from "New Acquisitions, New Work, New Selections 3:
Contemporary Selections," the Los Angeles County Museum of Art has
approached the challenge by casting a wide net. In the last five
years, the photography department, led by curator Robert Sobieszek,
has acquired more than 1,000 works, the majority of them produced
since 1940. This exhibition assembles about 80 of the most recent,
each by a different artist.</LD>
<LD>   It amounts to a lot of unconnected work, which makes the
exhibition something of a challenge for the viewer. It's difficult to
properly engage with individual photographs in this context--that is,
without a context.</LD>
<TE>   With the diversification of the medium during the past few
decades, the designation of "contemporary" offers little in the way
of a framework. In the absence, also, of geographical limitations
(more than a third of the artists represented were born outside the
United States) or a concrete thematic superstructure, the works are
only so many fragments floating against a neutral background.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the primary purpose of the exhibition is not to promote
the value of individual artworks, but to offer the public a glimpse
into the museum's acquisition process. One does leave the show
longing to see more from the assembled photographers, which means the
museum is surely doing something right.</TE>
<TE>   While there is no single, dominant sensibility behind the diverse
collection of work, a few notable tendencies emerge. Principal among
these is an avid interest in the versatility of the medium. There are
photographs here of nearly every sort: from traditional
black-and-white gelatin silver prints to big, saturated Cibachromes
to computer-generated collages to photographic reproductions of
paintings.</TE>
<TE>   On the traditional side, for example, is Brad Cole's elegant,
Ansel Adams-like view of a rocky seashore or Linda Connor's haunting
exploration of overgrown temple ruins in Angkor, Cambodia. Of a more
conceptual nature is "Razorback" (1990), by German artist Hanno
Otten: a large image of nothing but a green movie theater curtain,
presumably after it has closed on the film that provides the work's
title. James Welling's "Degrade #17" (1992)--a two-tone color field
image--is an example of the move toward complete abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   Also central to the exhibition is the question of manipulation.
The majority of works on view involve some degree of it, whether
chemical, digital, compositional or emotional, and the wall texts
(although sporadic and largely uneven) frequently urge viewers to
evaluate its role in construction of an image.</TE>
<TE>   The issue can seem at times forced, in the work--such as Nagatani
and Tracey's "34th &amp; Chambers" (1986), a large and rather garish
montage--as well as in the labels. Particularly irritating, for
example, is the wall text for Peter Garfield's "Mobile Home" (1994),
which seems intent on flattening the work's delightful ambiguity by
dangling the obvious questions: "Is this plausible? Might an artist
have actually rented a large helicopter to carry a full-sized
bungalow and drop it so that it could be photographed falling to
earth?"</TE>
<TE>   Far more exciting are the subtle examples of manipulation that one
stumbles upon unexpectedly, as in Nancy Burson's portrait of a man
with an eye patch that is decorated with a strangely sad drawing of
the eye that it covers, or Mike Smith's view of a rural Tennessee
landscape that's been flattened and abstracted merely through clever
positioning of the camera.</TE>
<TE>   If there's anything that seems to be on the outs, as forecast by
this exhibition, it is the mystique of the decisive moment. With few
exceptions (notably, a Lee Friedlander image of a telemarketer frozen
in an amusingly twisted grimace), the vast majority of the works in
the exhibition are pointedly altered, posed, staged, naturally still
(as in a landscape), or appropriated. Whether it be a reflection of
the general artistic climate or of curatorial taste, trust in the
magic of the photographic accident appears to be all but extinct.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest works in the show, as is typically the case in
exhibitions, transcend any particular theme or issue. These include
James Casebere's enigmatic but luminous landscape of water and light;
Miwa Yanagi's smart, stylized diptych of Japanese elevator girls
trapped in a sterile interior corridor; Simen Johan's hauntingly
ambiguous image of a young boy clinging dangerously to a black cat;
Gregory Crewdson's elaborately staged depiction of a woman kneeling
in a flower garden that's somehow landed in the middle of a suburban
kitchen; and Eric Rondepierre's "Convulsion" (1996-98), a blown-up
porn still that has eroded in such a way as to suggest that the
sprawling nude female figure it depicts has, in her apparent rapture,
been coated with a creepy alien substance.</TE>
<TE>   Striking works by some familiar names from northern Europe round
out the selection nicely. Although Wolfgang Tillmans is notably
absent, Thomas Ruff and Rineke Dijkstra both appear with stunningly
sharp and memorable portraits, while Thomas Struth is represented by
an image from his museum series that should startle anyone who has
only seen his work in reproductions. Although seemingly banal in
subject matter, it exudes an ethereal and photographically
inexplicable glow that may well make it the most enticing single
object in the exhibition. (It whets the appetite for Struth's MOCA
exhibition in September.)</TE>
<TE>   The most outstanding work in the show, by considerable measure, is
Gerhard Richter's "48 Portraits" (1998), which literally reproduces a
series of paintings made by the artist in 1972 of important European
and American men who were born in the 19th century, copied from
photomechanical illustrations in a German encyclopedia.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the 48 images is, essentially, a photograph of a painting
made from a photograph, which results in a subtle but remarkably
complicated mingling of diverse visual properties: the stiff flatness
of the original image, the faint sensuality of the paint, and the
liquid-like veneer of the final photograph.</TE>
<TE>   Installed in a grid on three adjacent walls, the work fills the
space with an eerie and intimidating grayness. The stark rows of
disembodied heads speak to the tendency of Western culture to locate
greatness in the minds of white men.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than inspiring respect for their enduring accomplishments,
however, it leaves one reeling from the oppressiveness of the austere
pantheon, longing for a glimpse of their bodies to restore a sense of
balance and humanity.</TE>
<TE>   It is a breathtaking and profoundly discomfiting work that should
merit a prominent position in LACMA's permanent galleries when it
comes to be installed there.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rest of the new acquisitions, their fate is somewhat
less certain: No doubt most will be quickly consigned to the safety
of a flat drawer, available for framing when the appropriate occasion
arises. This exhibition is a useful opportunity to peek into that
drawer before it closes.</TE>

<LD>After a long, storied history, Pamela Des Barres' 1987 memoir, "I'm
With the Band"--the colorful, definitive account of the L.A. rock
world of the '60s and '70s from a young girl's, um, intimate
perspective--is on its way to the screen. Des Barres is co-writing
the screenplay, with Allison Anders ("Grace of the Heart") set to
direct for the Starz! cable channel.</LD>
<LD>   "It's all about a groupie girl growing up in the Valley and
heading over the hills to Oz, to meet all the rock stars," Des Barres
says.</LD>
<LD>   Where Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous" (a similar story, from the
view of a male teenage tyro journalist) fictionalized Crowe's
real-life experience, Des Barres' book names names, unflinchingly
detailing her relationships (sexual and otherwise) with rockers
including Jimmy Page, Mick Jagger, Keith Moon, Gram Parsons and Frank
Zappa, as well as her experience as a member of the Zappa-produced
groupies group the GTO's (Girls Together Outrageously).</LD>
<TE>   "What I love about Starz! is they have the guts to do that," Des
Barres says.</TE>
<TE>   "In earlier treatments that have been done for the book, names
have been changed. But they're public figures--or unfortunately in
rock 'n' roll heaven. No one has sued me about the book. It's all the
truth."</TE>
<TE>   The book has been the subject of several previous attempts to put
it on film. Ally Sheedy once optioned the rights with the intention
of playing Des Barres, and later Drew Barrymore and Christina
Applegate each explored the role. But it wasn't until Des Barres
started working on a screenplay with high school friend Iva Turner
that the project really got moving, as Anders signed on and Starz!
came on board.</TE>
<TE>   Anders thinks the time is right for the story.</TE>
<TE>   "When the book came out, I remember everyone focused on the
groupie aspect of it," Anders says. "It's funny that to me now it
actually seems far more innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "The more Pamela and I talk," Anders adds, "I don't really see it
as a groupie story, but a fan's story and the story of the GTO's.
That's what really draws me to it."</TE>
<TE>   Casting will begin once the script is finished, although Des
Barres is eyeing at least a cameo for herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Iva and I both want to dance in the love-in sequence," she says.</TE>
<TE>   CIVILIAN DUTIES: Speculation is heating up over which manager will
land the revived project teaming Chris Cornell with Rage Against the
Machine's Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk.</TE>
<TE>   The group, which formed a year ago and had been using the name
Civilian, split recently, reportedly over disputes stemming from
working with two management companies. Cornell is handled by Laguna
Beach-based Jim Guerinot, the Rage contingent by New York-based Q
Prime.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, though, the group is said to have reformed to
move forward with an album targeted for fall, on the condition that
the members find new, neutral management.</TE>
<TE>   Word inside the music business is that the front-runners are the
Firm (the powerful home of Korn and Limp Bizkit) and Irving Azoff
(the Eagles manager who has revitalized his company by taking on the
Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera). Pat Magnarella (Green Day,
Goo Goo Dolls) and Arthur Spivak (Tori Amos) also are said to have
their hats in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether the band intends to tour. Guerinot was on
vacation and unavailable; Q Prime declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   AUTHOR, AUTHOR: Wyn Cooper became an accidental hit lyricist when
Sheryl Crow revamped a poem of his into her 1993 breakthrough single,
"All I Wanna Do." Now Cooper is helping acclaimed veteran novelist
Madison Smartt Bell become an accidental pop singer.</TE>
<TE>   The main character of Bell's new novel, "Anything Goes," is a
musician, and Bell and Cooper teamed to write Americana-tinged songs
that the character would sing.</TE>
<TE>   Working with a handful of musicians and a few singers, a
demo-quality CD was recorded to send to reviewers and film producers
as a casual companion to the book.</TE>
<TE>   Now a small North Carolina record label, Gaff Music, wants to
produce a real CD from the songs. Based on two songs Bell sang on the
demos, the label wants him to be the featured performer.</TE>
<TE>   Plans call for the album to be recorded in December (the first
opportunity Bell would have between book tours and his duties
teaching creative writing at Goucher College in Maryland). Don Dixon,
who co-produced R.E.M.'s first two albums, is expected to produce
some of the songs and play on the sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "I've worked with several songwriters after the Sheryl Crow thing,
wrote some good songs with good people, but nothing panned out," says
Cooper. "Working with Madison, who I've known for years, really made
a difference .... He's probably more shocked than I am."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bell would rather hear other people sing his songs.</TE>
<TE>   "My idea was to create this stuff for other people to perform," he
says, citing Bonnie Raitt as his ideal choice for the "Anything Goes"
songs. "I'm not giving up on that."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Tori Amos, following the "Strange Little Girls" album
in which she reworked male-written songs from a female perspective,
has finished "Scarlet's Walk," which traces in song an eastbound trip
across the U.S. post-Sept. 11. It's her first album for Epic Records,
it's due Oct. 15, and it will be preceded by the single "A Sorta
Fairytale." ...</TE>
<TE>   The annual Sunset Junction festival, set for Aug. 24 and 25 in
Silver Lake, has scored two strong headliners: Sonic Youth tops the
first day's bill, with Sleater-Kinney finishing the second. Mudhoney,
Pansy Division and an all-star tribute to the Gun Club organized by
Keith Morris are among others scheduled for the event....</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;B singer Blu Cantrell is working on her second album, due in
late October, with Missy Elliot, Dallas Austin and the team Soul
Shock &amp; Karlin....</TE>
<TE>   A national Plea for Peace/Take Action Tour benefiting the
suicide-prevention National Hopeline Network will embark Sept. 13 in
Worcester, Mass., with Jimmy Eat World, the Promise Ring, Cave In and
the (International) Noise Conspiracy among the regional headliners.</TE>

<LD>   RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS</LD>
<LD>   "By the Way"</LD>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   The Chili Peppers' transformation from party animals to puppy dogs
has been so protracted and organic that it's never seemed as unlikely
as it actually is. From socks on their privates to hearts on their
sleeves, it all makes perfect sense in the wacky world of L.A.'s
favorite dysfunctional rock family.</TE>
<TE>   That introspective side reached full bloom on 1999's
"Californication," and it remains the core of this follow-up (due in
stores Tuesday). The Chili Peppers' hearts really don't seem to be in
the up-tempo songs, which register as perfunctory nods to
expectations and tap the worst side of Anthony Kiedis'
singing--staccato jive and clumsy rapping.</TE>
<TE>   His plaintive, nasal croon, on the other hand, especially when
tracing the melancholy melodic signature the band relies on, can
stake its claim as a key voice of the modern rock generation. A
little lost and wounded, sorting through regrets and summoning
determination, it suggests someone facing the realization that all
those old demons are not easily shaken.</TE>
<TE>   "By the Way" lacks the striking spareness of "Californication,"
but the arrangements are rich and often surprising, deploying
strings, spacey effects and acoustic stretches to vary the
atmosphere. The band's sweet, suburban soulfulness gets sidetracked
by lapses into generic forms, but when they head into the landscape
of the eternal hangover, the Chili Peppers manage to provide comfort
even as they search for it.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   COUNTING CROWS</TE>
<TE>   "Hard Candy"</TE>
<TE>   Geffen</TE>
<TE>   With song titles referencing the Band's Richard Manuel (whose
vocal ability to convey psychic hurt seemingly foreshadowed his
suicide) and more obscure Scottish soul-blues singer Frankie Miller
(left unable to sing since a 1994 brain hemorrhage), Crows singer
Adam Duritz sets the emotional bar high for his band's fourth studio
album (due Tuesday). The intentions are commendable--although the
execution falls short.</TE>
<TE>   In "If I Could Give All My Love to You (Richard Manuel Is Dead),"
he seeks to "justify myself, but I'm just not coming through," neatly
encapsulating the desperation of yearning deeply but not being able
to express it sufficiently.</TE>
<TE>   But as an artist, he fails to transcend that problem. In part,
that's because his voice simply lacks Manuel's heartbreak quality,
and in part, it's because his lyrics rarely go beyond plain
statement, whether in first person or detached, if compassionate,
observations of people mired alternately in stasis or endless
restlessness.</TE>
<TE>   The musical expression is another problem. Where the rough edges
left on the band's last album, "This Desert Life," made for the
Crows' most rewarding (if least commercially successful) studio
release, the playing here, under producer Steve Lillywhite (U2, Dave
Matthews), is too mannered.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the most intriguing tracks are those that stray
furthest from the usual Band/Van Morrison territory. The
strings-adorned "Butterfly in Reverse" is a wistful waltz that could
pass as a Bacharach-David song, while the snappy "New Frontier" is
somewhere between R.E.M. and the B-52's. In those there's a certain
boldness otherwise lacking in the album.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   ORISHAS</TE>
<TE>   "Emigrante"</TE>
<TE>   Universal Music Latino</TE>
<TE>   In their latest video, these expatriate Cuban rappers appear
larger than life, walking on water as they return to their native
island from the sea. They prowl Havana's decaying streets like a trio
of hip-hop Gullivers, demanding to know what's happening in their old
neighborhood: Que es lo que pasa en mi barrio? The striking
image--exiles coming home by the route usually used to
escape--captures the soaring spirit of this imaginative and stirring
work.</TE>
<TE>   Orishas, named for the gods of Santeria, won critical acclaim for
its 2000 debut, "A Lo Cubano," and its intriguing mix of rap and
traditional Cuban music. But by comparison, that work now sounds like
a demo tape, a rough cut of a good concept.</TE>
<TE>   In this follow-up (in stores Tuesday), the Paris-based group has
perfected the balance between the aggression of hip-hop, the
sweetness of son and the irresistible, polyrhythmic pulses of the
rumba. The songs flow like mini-suites, weaving rap sections with
graceful melodies and elaborate lyrics about the joys of fatherhood,
the dignity of women, the disillusionment of once-hopeful immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   In the video of "eforeQue Pasa!" the towering trio walks back out to
sea, leaving behind a Havana covered in scaffolding and suggesting
that new things must now be built. Musically, Orishas has laid a
solid foundation.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Dolly Parton, "Halos &amp; Horns," Sugarhill. The erstwhile
country queen continues her trek through her Appalachian roots in a
collection (due Tuesday) that makes a couple of nods to her
pop-crossover days. The world could have survived without her remake
of Bread's saccharine pop ballad "If," but believe it or not, her
bluegrass translation of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" works
just fine to close out this exploration of the eternal struggle
between the sacred and the secular. And "Hello God" is a classic
expression of one person's desperate bid to understand earthly
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   *** MC Eiht, "Underground Hero," D3. As the frontman for
influential gangster-rap group Compton's Most Wanted, this California
rapper helped popularize thought-provoking, hard-core hip-hop. On his
seventh solo album, Eiht raps with precision about the highs and lows
of street life over beats that range from smoothed-out gangster
grooves to crisp, funk-inspired soundscapes. Eiht focuses on good
times here more than he ever has, creating a feel-good gangster
party.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** Jazzanova, "In Between," Ropeadope/Atlantic. This German dance
ensemble is the latest act to venture forth from production and remix
work into the realm of original music. On its studio debut, Jazzanova
creates a rich and melodious world that sings with the smooth beats
of jazz, '70s-style funk, Brazilian music and soul. "In Between" is
as stylish as any album in recent memory, and a classic late-night
chill-out CD.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Baltin</TE>
<TE>   *** The Possibilities, "Way Out," Parasol. Sounding like '60s
legends one minute and tight, digital-age indie rockers the next,
this Athens, Ga., quintet frolics in classic influences without
sounding antique. Working in a Spector haze, all five Possibilities
share vocals, harmonizing pristinely while dazzling keyboards by
Jason Gonzalez dictate the mood. Fresh old sounds? When you're
versatile enough to recall Pavement and reverent enough to cover Del
Shannon, it's possible.</TE>

<HD>Hampton's the Host of This Propulsive Party</HD>

<LD>   LIONEL HAMPTON &amp; HIS BIG BAND</LD>
<LD>   "Live at the</LD>
<TE>   John Anson Ford Amphitheatre"</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Records</TE>
<TE>   Vibes virtuoso and bandleader Lionel Hampton doesn't perform much
anymore, so anyone who values his rhythmically propulsive approach to
music-making will welcome the sheer energy and drive of the
performance captured here.</TE>
<TE>   Recorded live in Los Angeles in 1998, when Hamp was a mere 90
years old, the two-CD set vividly documents the excitement of the
occasion. You can hear it in the hard-charging ensemble playing on
"Hallelujah Again," the nimble reed and brass solos on "Brand New
Baby," the whinnying blues riffs on "Soul Serenade" and the lush
colors of "A Night in Tunisia." Even amid this orgy of orchestra
color, however, Hamp's vibes playing stands out, as in his whimsical
solos on "Hamp's Boogie Woogie."</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Hampton at 90 wasn't producing as much sound and fury as
in earlier days, yet his elegant melodicism and piquant chord choices
prove difficult to resist. And his soft and tender vocals on "What a
Wonderful World" hardly could be more poignant. This set (which opens
with performances by Ernie Andrews, Gerald Wiggins and the late Harry
"Sweets" Edison) likely will stand as Hamp's last recording. As such,
it's an indispensable CD.</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   ORBERT DAVIS</TE>
<TE>   "Priority"</TE>
<TE>   3Sixteen Records</TE>
<TE>   Among jazz connoisseurs, trumpeter Orbert Davis long has been
considered a soloist on the ascent. With the release of this
breakthrough recording, Davis' moment may have arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The brilliance of his technique, the maturity of his conception
and the high polish of his arrangements make "Priority" one of the
most persuasive jazz recordings of the year. Each track makes a vivid
statement, from the hard-bop spirit of Davis' title track to the sly
rhythmic swagger of Ryan Cohan's "Ask Me Nicely," from the explosive
energy of Davis' aptly named "Relentless" to the seductive melodicism
of "Block Party."</TE>
<TE>   Joined by such formidable players as tenor saxophonist Ari Brown,
bassist James Cammack and guest vocalist Kurt Elling, Davis has
created something of an instant classic. And check out the bonus

<TE>   "Prescription</TE>

<TE>   The Sirens</TE>
<TE>   Classic jazz, blues and boogie from the South Side of Chicago will
flourish so long as Barrelhouse Chuck is at work.</TE>
<TE>   In his newest release, a welcome solo outing, the singer-pianist
asserts himself as a veritable one-man-band. Listen to his
exquisitely ornamented piano lines on Leroy Carr's "My Own Lonesome
Blues," rolling boogie rhythms on Carr's "Mean Mistreater Mama" and
all-over-the-keys virtuosity on Sunnyland Slim's "Johnson Machine
Gun," and it's clear that Barrelhouse Chuck has become an important
advocate for historic repertoire. At the same time, he builds on the
achievements of the giants with the beauty of his keyboard touch and
the melancholy tone of his vocals.</TE>

<TE>   Although singer Darius de Haas has contributed to a number of
high-toned recording projects in recent years, including Michael John
LaChiusa's 1999 musical "Marie Christine," with this solo release he
announces himself as a potentially major jazz vocalist.</TE>
<TE>   Offering sometimes radical reappraisals of jazz standards by
composer Billy Strayhorn, De Haas proves fearless in recasting these
tunes in original, distinctive ways. Generally, he leans toward slow
tempos, dreamy moods and unabashedly idiosyncratic phrasings, but
this seemingly leisurely approach allows him to explore otherwise
forgotten details of such well-worn fare as "Take the 'A' Train" and
"Lush Life." His pairing of "Passion Flower" and "A Flower Is a
Lovesome Thing" is particularly effective, reminding listeners that
Strayhorn's best tunes stand as art songs worthy of meticulous
interpretation.</TE>

<HD>Tunes He Can Sink His Teeth Into</HD>
<DH>He knows 'South Pacific' well, but veteran baritone Robert
Goulet still finds the music deeply affecting</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are worse ways to start a morning than having Robert Goulet
serenade you over the phone. So here it is, 10 in the morning, and
Goulet is crooning the haunting ballad "This Nearly Was Mine," his
favorite song from "South Pacific."</LD>
<LD>   Goulet, who has been starring in the national tour of the Rodgers
&amp; Hammerstein classic since March, brings the show to Los Angeles on
Tuesday for a two-week engagement at the Wilshire Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   "As a singer, you can really let go and get involved in the
lyrics," Goulet, 68, booms over the phone from Seattle. "So clear and
deep are my fancies / Of things I wish were true," he sings in his
still-rich baritone. "I'll keep remembering evenings / I wish I had
spent with you...."</LD>
<TE>   Though not as well known as such "South Pacific" standards as
"Some Enchanted Evening," "A Wonderful Guy," "Happy Talk," "Bali
Ha'i" and "Bloody Mary," the song gets to him every performance,
Goulet acknowledges. "Every singer likes to sink his teeth into a
song like that."</TE>
<TE>   Audiences' response to the tune of love lost has been
enthusiastic. "People are whistling and yelling and cheering. I never
heard that before," he says. "It's wonderful but it's also
embarrassing. I am supposed to be in a lot of pain, but I can't even
bow to the audience."</TE>
<TE>   This current tour of "South Pacific" is just one of the many
events this year celebrating what would have been Rodgers' 100th
birthday. Winner of nine Tony Awards in 1950, "South Pacific" is
based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning collection of stories by James
Michener, "Tales of the South Pacific."</TE>
<TE>   Set on a picturesque Pacific island during World War II, the
musical explores prejudice through two love stories. Goulet plays the
effervescent Emile de Becque, a handsome French widower who falls in
love with a much younger and naive American nurse, Nellie (Amanda
Watkins). Although the two want to marry, Nellie, who is from
Arkansas, calls off the engagement after she discovers Emile was
married to a Polynesian woman and has two children by her.</TE>
<TE>   This production's director, Scott Faris, says that despite initial
fears, Goulet was easy to work with. "He never for a minute said, 'I
did it this way before,' " Faris says. "He would just take direction,
and if he questioned something, like with any actor, if I explained
it to him why I wanted him to do it, he'd say, 'OK.' "</TE>
<TE>   Watkins had not previously met Goulet but acknowledges she too was
a bit worried about working with him. "You always assume people like
that might be a little tricky because he has been around for years
and years," she says. "I am sort of a new kid on the block,
comparatively speaking, as is Scott. But he has been a dream. He was
fun in rehearsal, and he still is to this day."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, says Watkins, instead of being a prima don, Goulet is
"such a normal guy. He's inventive. He does new things on stage all
the time, which I appreciate. He's such a rock. He never missed the
show. He's never out."</TE>
<TE>   Goulet's first encounter with "South Pacific" was in 1955, when he
played the secondary male lead, Lt. Cable, in a summer stock
production in Stanley Park in Vancouver, Canada. "I said at the time,
'One day I am going to play the old man's part.' And I did."</TE>
<TE>   He first played Emile in a 1988 tour of the musical and says that
over the years, his interpretation of the character hasn't changed.
"I try to play him as authentically as I can," he says. "I play him
with a bit of a French accent. There's not much leeway with the
character, I don't think. First of all, he's crazy about this nurse
and is a little nervous being with her. But when she says she loves
him, it's 'whoa, whoa. Get out of the way.' "</TE>
<TE>   Goulet's Emile loves life and has a bountiful sense of good humor.
In fact, says Watkins, both spotlight their characters' lighter
sides. "We're very playful," she says. "That is why we make it work,
because there is a pretty intense age difference, and from the very
beginning we have been so goofy with each other."</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers' daughter, composer-writer Mary Rodgers, saw the
production in New Haven, Conn., and had a few words of advice for
Goulet. "She said some of those notes, you are holding a little too
long," Goulet recalls. "I said, 'Beg your pardon. Isn't that
something like artistic interpretation?' She said, 'Yes, but what
about my father's artistic interpretation when he wrote the notes? He
didn't say hang on to these notes for, like, 30 seconds.' "</TE>
<TE>   So Goulet thought about what she told him. "She was right. I was
holding the notes too long at the end of 'Some Enchanted Evening.' "
But he didn't change anything with a short song he sings before "This
Nearly Was Mine," where he holds a note for dramatic effect. "I don't
know if she wants me to cut that one," he says, "but I won't."</TE>
<TE>   Touring, says Goulet, takes a lot of discipline. He eats only one
meal a day, usually at noon. If his business manager wife, Vera,
doesn't want to have lunch at that time, Goulet usually leaves the
hotel alone and goes out for a walk. "I will find a little hole in
the wall--someplace Italian or Greek or French--that is not well
known. You have two glasses of wine and good food. I love that."</TE>
<TE>   After his repast, he reads the paper, takes a nap, then heads to
the theater. "I never have a problem with my voice," Goulet says
matter-of-factly. "Usually I got to the theater and make a couple of
noises. If it isn't there, you make a couple of more noises."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his wife, Goulet is traveling on this tour with a
14-week-old Abyssinian kitten named Zorba. "He's a killer," Goulet
says. "We have seven cats at home. Don't ask me why."</TE>
<TE>   Goulet, who lives in Las Vegas, will be staying home a lot more in
the future. "My darling," he says, "in October or November of 2004, a
new hotel will be on the strip called City by the Bay, and in the
City by the Bay, there will be a theater, from 1,500 to 1,800 seats,
where I will be in charge. I am going to be performing there six
nights a week, kid. I get to sleep in my own bed."</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement is vastly superior to Goulet's disastrous
engagement last July at the Venetian. "We had a backer who backed out
at the last second," he says. "All of a sudden, it cost us a couple
of hundred thousand a week, which is too much money. There are no
tourists in July. We died."</TE>
<TE>   With his new gig, Goulet says, "the hotel will be doing the
publicity. It's not going to cost me anything, but I am going to get
paid to show up!"</TE>

<HD>What We Need Is a Good Fest</HD>
<DH>The L.A. Festival was a fine celebration of our diversity.
Now the times have caught up with-- in fact, cry out for--an
adventurous arts event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bicycling along the coast one recent morning, I did just about
everything wrong. Having predicted that the sun wouldn't break
through the gloom, I overdressed. I didn't eat or drink enough. And I
miscalculated the crowds, not expecting to have to dodge so many
distracted drivers, Roller-bladers, joggers and skateboarders that
early. Overheated, lightheaded and irritated, I groaned past the one
snack bar that doesn't blast commercial rock radio, and picked up a
few bars of a Bach "Brandenberg" Concerto wafting in the wind.</LD>
<LD>   Instantly refreshed, I knew at that moment we need a new Los
Angeles Festival.</LD>
<LD>   As the summer heats up, the Southland's cultural landscape can
begin to look like one big beach town. A numbing backbeat encourages
us to leave our brains at home no matter where we are.</LD>
<TE>   There are a few exceptions. SummerFest La Jolla, in its second
year under violinist Cho-Liang Lin, is turning into a wide-ranging
chamber music festival of note. The venturesome arts hound should be
able to sniff out something interesting now and then in an
out-of-the-way venue, such as the MAK Center series at the Schindler
House in West Hollywood, the two Southwest Chamber Music concerts at
the Huntington Library in San Marino, or the occasional ambitious
offerings at the downtown branch of the Los Angeles Public Library,
the California Plaza and Hollywood's John Anson Ford Amphitheatre.
But generally the musical summer in the Southland is depressingly
predictable.</TE>
<TE>   Want something new, for instance, at the Hollywood Bowl? Well,
this year's innovation is a market where you can put together your
own dinner. As the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl
Orchestra prepare for their concert series, which begin this week,
picnickers no longer need to plan. But it is also typical that
thinking outside the box at the Bowl these days is directed at the
box seats and picnic baskets rather than at the shell.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the need for that rejuvenating jolt of surprise and
substance that a summer festival can bring to, say, the dog days and
smog days of August. Los Angeles, of course, has a history of summer
festivals. Eighteen years ago, the arts festival that was produced to
accompany the Summer Olympic Games was a groundbreaking success that
lasted from the beginning of June to the middle of August. It began
by introducing Pina Bausch's Wuppertal Dance Theater to America. It
brought London's Royal Opera to the Music Center. It offered a
distinguished sampling of Asian dance, music and theater that
included the U.S. debut of Sankaijuku's butoh-style dance and Tadashi
Suzuki's reworking of "The Trojan Women."</TE>
<TE>   We heard or saw Mozart, Michael Tilson Thomas, Merce Cunningham,
Karlheinz Stockhausen and Derek Jacobi (as Cyrano). Giorgio
Strehler's unforgettable Piccolo Teatro di Milano was on hand, as
were the Canadians who staged Tolkien's "The Hobbit" with 48 rod
puppets, and Cricot 2, a politically charged theater company from
Poland. In its American debut, Ariane Mnouchkine's Parisian troupe Le
Theatre du Soleil performed astonishing Shakespeare on a television
sound stage.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the modern history of performing arts in Los Angeles
could be divided into before and after the Olympic Arts Festival. An
example of the festival's impact was the degree to which the Royal
Opera's performances of "Turandot," "The Magic Flute" and "Peter
Grimes" kick-started the latent Los Angeles Opera, which began as
Music Center Opera two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Organized by Robert Fitzpatrick the massive Olympic Arts Festival
(which involved 1,500 artists from 18 countries) led to what was
hoped would becoming a permanent Los Angeles Festival. Although
Fitzpatrick could no longer count on an Olympic-sized budget for his
smaller second festival in 1987, he nevertheless introduced Peter
Brook's monumental "Mahabarata" and Cirque du Soleil to the U.S. that
September.</TE>
<TE>   Following the 1987 festival, Fitzpatrick, who was then president
of CalArts, exchanged Los Angeles for Paris, where he was hired to
run EuroDisney, and the Los Angeles Festival was handed over to
theater and opera director Peter Sellars. In his two festivals,
Sellars broadened the international scope of presentations, at the
same time making them far more grass-roots. The arts elite expressed
disappointment in the lack of stellar imports. Sellars, however,
looked deeply into the Southland's multicultural potential and
amplified it with a large contingent of indigenous arts from Africa
and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Fitzpatrick's festivals were literally all over the map, but
Sellars' festivals were even more boldly decentralized, with the
director avoiding European work altogether. Festival-goers found
themselves hunting for, say, a park in San Gabriel to see a
late-night Balinese puppet show, and would-be festival-goers simply
refused to visit neighborhoods they considered scary. Sellars'
organization was not tidy; last-minute flights of creative fancy were
more common than careful planning. The lack of slickness alienated
the mainstream media, and poor publicity kept away some of the
audience. After the fourth festival in 1993, the Los Angeles Festival
was quietly put on hold, left to  wither away.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Sellars has been raked over the coals in Australia,
where he was installed as director of the 2002 Adelaide Festival and
where he tried to follow much the same approach as in L.A. He was
ousted late last year amid dissatisfaction over his decision to focus
on Aboriginal arts and other aspects of Australian culture that are
usually overlooked, instead of shipping in glitzy European
entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   One Australian newspaper called it the "worst-run, worst-financed
and worst-publicized festival of all time." Budget shortfalls
discovered at the last minute led to scaled-down programming and
political intervention that forced Sellars' resignation in November,
just 3 1/2 months before the festival. After an initial flirtation
with the charismatic director, some of the critics turned ugly. "We
are glad that he and his infernal hugs have gone," concluded one
editorial that described Sellars' programming as "idealistic folly."
It was commonplace for the Australian press to equate the Adelaide
situation with the "disaster" of the Los Angeles Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Yet now that the controversy has died down, there are proposals in
Adelaide to make permanent certain Sellars innovations that brought
indigenous arts to the city streets and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the Los Angeles Festival was no disaster. It was, no
doubt, poorly administered. But it was also ahead of its time. It
validated the artistic diversity of Southern California to a degree
that had never before been attempted.</TE>
<TE>   The world-music movement was still nascent when Sellars mounted
his festivals, and Los Angeles was just waking up to the kind of
revolutionary multicultural society that the city was creating.
Sellars fearlessly jumped into the deep end of these multiculti
waters, and the masses weren't always ready to follow. Ultimately,
though, it was the economic downturn in Los Angeles during the early
'90s, more than the programming or disorganization, that did in the
Los Angeles Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Yet take a look at this summer's Lincoln Center Festival in New
York City, with its emphasis on Chinese opera, Iranian theater and
Merce Cunningham. That's L.A. a decade ago. The legacy of the Los
Angeles Festival also resonates in other ways. Alumni from the
Sellars years, for instance, went on to produce the worthy World
Festival of Sacred Music three years ago, and it will be revived
again later this summer.</TE>
<TE>   There are any number of arguments why Los Angeles should not
attempt another festival. In a Sunday Calendar story last month about
the obstacles of mounting a local film festival, many of the old
difficulties were once again aired. L.A. is too sprawling and
chaotic. There's the traffic. It's no mountain resort, no
too-charming-for-words Salzburg or walkable Edinburgh, sites of
major, long-running European summer festivals. "It's really hard to
have something for everybody," a former Angeleno film festival
director complained.</TE>
<TE>   But sprawl and a certain amount of chaos are the whole point of an
ambitious festival. And the positive side of all that sprawl is a
wealth of resources, everything from dark concert halls to the widest
imaginable range of possibilities for unconventional venues. As one
of the world's largest and most ethnically diverse cities, Los
Angeles has equally vast culture resources.</TE>
<TE>   What it doesn't have, you might think, is the money to pay for a
world-class summer festival. To squeeze it out of the city or county
is not likely. City Hall grumbled about providing even simple
services for the previous festivals. With all the local arts
institutions that are building or dreaming of building new
facilities, fund-raising these days is no simple matter.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, a venturesome festival is exactly the kind of thing that
could help stimulate all these projects by focusing attention on the
town and its arts, by attracting tourists and burnishing L.A.'s image
as the city of the future. Such a festival is good for the local
economy and good for the community. What with all the secessionist
movements, we have never been more in need of an event that could
help bring us together again. Simply think of a festival not as an
expense but an investment.</TE>
<TE>   The exhilaration of a Los Angeles Festival would do more than
diminish summer cultural doldrums; it would make this a greater city.
It already has.</TE>

<HD>The New Ugly Americans Are Giving Us All a Bad Name</HD>
<DH>Corporate scandals stain the U.S. abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>GUANGZHOU, China</DL>
<LD>I've been feeling glum about the drift and shortsightedness of
American business for some time. Being abroad and looking back at my
homeland only makes me glummer.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. "war against terrorism" is a fight for our way of life,
for ideals and idealism, for freedom and for opportunity. Back home,
most of the people I know have hardly a doubt about the soundness of
these things. Americans, I among them, have closed ranks behind the
men and women who stand on the murky front lines of the battle.</LD>
<LD>   But the relentless boardroom scandals of 2002 are undermining the
nation abroad, and not just in the Muslim world or on hostile
terrain. When someone like Intel's chairman, Andrew S. Grove, finds
himself "feeling embarrassed and ashamed" to be an American business
executive, he should be. The country's global leadership--its example
to the world--is as easy to doubt as to believe in right now. Yes,
countries like China and other developing nations around the world
know greed and corruption. But the U.S. has for a long time projected
itself as different--a country where integrity and prosperity are
maintained by self-governance and lofty principles of justice.</LD>
<TE>   Not so these days.</TE>
<TE>   Americans aren't alone in understanding that what has engulfed
U.S. business is not the corruption of an individual or an
administration or a party or an industry but the corruption of a
system. Sadly, it is the system that the United States is trying to
sell--or, let's say, defend--as the model for the world.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans view the rot in our entrepreneurial values, vast as
it is, as a momentary and correctable turn of events. Unfortunately,
the disclosures spill forth at the precise moment when skeptics
abroad are hungry to capitalize on any evidence of our moral
failings.</TE>
<TE>   "For a superpower, as America calls itself, your house is in
disarray, am I right?" asks a Chinese businesswoman over dinner. How
does a visiting American answer such a question today?</TE>
<TE>   China has embraced free markets with barely bounded enthusiasm,
and this southern megalopolis of Guangzhou is where the boom has the
greatest momentum. But the Chinese I spoke with, as well as the
English-language press in Asia, make clear that the United States'
claim to be the custodian of free-market leadership is open to
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   The flood of American manufacturing investment into China is not
necessarily a show of power. American industry is not seen as
expanding so much as it is fleeing, as if something is wrong at home.
Headlines circle the world with revelations of accounting frauds,
mass layoffs, insider trading, stock market shenanigans, pension
rip-offs and tax evasion, and they compound a darkening picture of
Uncle Sam.</TE>
<TE>   In my conversations, Chinese were particularly attentive to
widespread job cuts and huge retirement losses inflicted on millions
of working people as a result of business corruption and the implicit
belief that the U.S. government is culpable in events. That
differentiates this scandal from Bill Clinton's dalliances or Ronald
Reagan's Iran-Contra or Richard Nixon's Watergate--transgressions
that ultimately wound up reinforcing the nation's strait-laced
values. By contrast, the misdoings of corporate executives and their
perceived insider domination of the government at the expense of the
citizenry reduce the U.S. to the stature of lesser nations.</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese don't view these events as bystanders, but as distant
victims. The fizzling of stock investments in the U.S. has dragged
down markets worldwide, and Asian newspapers protest, "We don't
deserve this." The result is a blow to the fundamental American
message that free markets thrive for the betterment of everyone under
the hand of U.S.-style pluralism.</TE>
<TE>   "Good government," said Confucius, "obtains when those who are
near are made happy, and those far off are attracted." Who could
blame Chinese or Africans or Latin Americans for not finding American
mores so attractive just now? The looting of a nation's wealth by a
few is something long associated with despots, not idealists. The
country that demands "transparency" in the affairs of other nations
is now unmasked for secret dealings that ended up with billions of
dollars going missing.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. looks for friends in the world, might and muscle count
for plenty. But the only true and lasting argument for democracy is
its example.</TE>

<HD>Let a Public Board Set Health-Care Rates</HD>
<DH>Manage hospitals like utilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE COURT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only way to ensure access to Los Angeles County's emergency rooms
and hospitals is by employing the same model that Angelenos use to
protect their electricity and water costs and Marylanders use to
maintain their hospitals: public utility regulation.</LD>
<LD>   A publicly accountable state "cost-control commission" could save
our medical infrastructure by redirecting excess profits in one part
of the system to underfunded priorities in another.</LD>
<LD>   Maryland long ago protected the stability of its hospital system
through a similar model. An independent commission determines
appropriate reimbursements for hospitals, and all payers are required
to pay commission-approved rates. The system ensures access to
essential services, controls prices and rationalizes "cost shifting,"
where payments from the insured or taxpayer commonly cover the
uninsured.</LD>
<TE>   In Southern California, cost-shifting has undermined many
hospitals because HMOs pay so little for services for the insured
that there is no money left to care for the uninsured and sometimes
not enough to keep the doors open.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that there is not enough money in the health-care system;
it's that it is going to all the wrong places. HMOs are making a
killing, while the county system is hemorrhaging.</TE>
<TE>   Public utility regulation of health services in California would
create a governmental body with representation from patients,
providers and other stakeholders to determine the equity of the
financing of vital community medical infrastructure and to guarantee
adequate public access to emergency rooms and hospitals. For example,
the cost-control commission could set reasonable limits on
profit-taking by HMOs and guarantee sufficient payments to providers.
HMOs and insurers simply are not paying their fair share to keep
hospitals and emergency rooms open and the safety net secure. Private
for-profit hospital chains, in order to boost profits, have also
played fast and loose with their public obligations to take all
comers in the ER. These practices have helped overload the county's
ER system, which takes all patients regardless of ability to pay or
insurance coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The rate-setting system for Maryland hospitals operates under the
principles that similar services at similar hospitals should cost the
same; that charges should be related to actual costs; and that all
payers should share the burden of "uncompensated" care for the
uninsured. The system has had widespread support and has been a
success in reducing the costs of care.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed is statewide public control over all health-care
dollars so that money can be directed to where it's most needed. With
nearly half of the state's voters living in Los Angeles and its four
adjacent counties, flexing the region's political muscle through a
statewide ballot initiative could protect underfunded emergency
rooms, hospitals and clinics.</TE>
<TE>   A California ballot initiative expanding on the Maryland model is
particularly salable because the overcrowding of emergency rooms and
disappearance of medical infrastructure is a middle-class issue. In
an emergency room, the insured and uninsured are all treated the
same. With or without insurance coverage, patients rushed to the ER
by ambulance in Los Angeles can be forced to wait up to five hours
before being seen by a doctor or nurse.</TE>
<TE>   Also, when an underfunded hospital disappears from a community, it
makes no difference how generous one's insurance coverage is. In an
emergency, the patient who has the best insurance may still have to
travel too far or wait too long to be saved.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County supervisors should lead a ballot campaign
for a cost-control commission. A ballot initiative can put directly
to the people the issue of whether the insured and uninsured alike
can afford to wait any longer for public control over all health-care
dollars.</TE>

<HD>Why We Love to Souffle Martha</HD>
<DH>Above all else, this nation just can't stand phonies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC DEZENHALL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She's blond. She smiles and cooks. Martha Stewart is certainly a
damsel, and there's no doubt she's in serious distress. Why, then, is
the public taking such glee in casting her as a villain?</LD>
<LD>   In the soap-opera love affairs that the nation has with its
celebrities, the downfall of a star is more fascinating than the
ascent to fame. But while few people could detail exactly what Wall
Street shenanigans Stewart may have been up to, lots of folks have
already convicted her of a far worse crime: phoniness. Sure, she may
act sweet when the cameras are on, we say to ourselves, but in
private she sharpens her knives for more than just cabbage--carving
up anyone, including her underlings, who get in her way.</LD>
<LD>   But if Americans can't stand phonies, we sure do love our straight
shooters. Tell it like it is, shed all pretense, and Americans will
draw you to their bosom. There was no better example of that than all
of the tributes to the late gangster John Gotti last month. News
outlets far and wide carried images of oversized flower arrangements
piled at his funeral.</LD>
<TE>   That's because Gotti never pretended to be anything other than
what he was: a flashy wiseguy. Murder? Extortion? Gambling? Whaddya
expect? He was a goodfella! And, boy, that camel-hair coat looked
great.</TE>
<TE>   Let's review. Martha Stewart called her broker and made a killing.
John Gotti called a hit man and made a killing. Martha, marauded.
Gotti, applauded.</TE>
<TE>   If that sounds like the preview for a Broadway musical, you're
following along. That's because American public life has become a
theatrical production, and when the characters don't play their
expected roles they're going to hear it from the audience. Commonly
mentioned in the obituary praise for Gotti was the idea that he was a
master of courting the media. But how did he really do that? Mob
bosses, after all, don't have PR men. The answer is that he was,
ultimately, just himself. What you saw was what you got. No spin, no
press releases and, unlike Stewart, certainly no Mob Living magazine.
Combine that with a contempt for authority and you have a classic
American antihero, one that we have instinctively loved and cheered
for since the days of the Wild West. No, even before that. After all,
what were the founding fathers but outlaws who scoffed at the
establishment and fought to set up their own gig?</TE>
<TE>   We reserve such special contempt for white-collar villains because
they operate from inside the system--that is to say, in the shadows.
Back rooms, smoke-filled boardrooms and private jets are the settings
where we imagine the fat cats are getting one over on the rest of us.
And when we catch one of them at it--aha!--cue the TV lights, 'cause
it's show time.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to weasel out of the charges only makes it worse. When
Gotti was tried, he strode proudly up the courthouse steps and
thumbed his nose at the government. Many secretly rooted for him, and
some openly cheered. But when Stewart told CBS that she would rather
concentrate on making a salad, jaws dropped. The same thing happened
when Enron chief Kenneth Lay's wife went on national television and
became weepy that she might lose one of her vacation homes. Examples
abound, yet for all the public outrage, Americans never seem to tire
of seeing this same drama play out.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Condit hasn't been convicted of any crime or even charged
with one. But his career is in ruins and he is a permanent figure of
public scorn. That's because the public found him guilty--of
hypocritical behavior, of using his position to weasel advantages. He
held himself up to be a pillar of the community while he was anything
but. After that, his blow-dry haircut and toothy smile became like a
mask of treachery.</TE>
<TE>   He paid real consequences, and probably too will Lay, Stewart and
the other corporate bigwigs--regardless of whether they're ever
convicted of any crime. Because in this country, you might get away
with cheating, but hypocrisy will get you whacked.</TE>

<HD>Even the Worst Thug Is Human, Your Honor</HD>
<DH>Courts must defend the rights of convicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON DOLOVICH</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catching what seems to be a national mood, the U.S. Supreme Court
recently handed down two big victories to death penalty opponents,
prompting observers to wonder whether a major shift is on its way in
terms of judicial willingness to protect the constitutional rights of
criminal offenders.</LD>
<LD>   The answer is no, as can be seen in another of the court's recent
cases. Hope vs. Pelzer didn't make the headlines. But it makes clear
how far we still are from a time when courts are ready and willing to
protect convicted criminal offenders from official cruelty and
caprice.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, Larry Hope was an inmate at Limestone Correctional
Facility in Capshaw, Ala. One June day, after an altercation with
guards at a work site, he was placed in leg irons and driven back to
the prison.</LD>
<TE>   On arrival, he was handcuffed to a horizontal bar known as the
"hitching post" and left standing with his arms above his shoulders
for seven hours in the sun. He had no shirt, little water and no
bathroom breaks. Guards stood by and taunted him.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the usual futility of such a move, Hope sued prison
officials, alleging that this treatment was a violation of the 8th
Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Hope lost in the trial court, and he lost on appeal. It took six
members of the U.S. Supreme Court to find that Hope's treatment at
the hands of the guards was so obviously cruel that no reasonable
person could think the acts passed constitutional muster.</TE>
<TE>   And still, three members of the court disagreed. Their reasoning?
Recent Alabama cases had consistently upheld the punitive use of the
hitching post.</TE>
<TE>   In one prior case, for example, an inmate had been handcuffed to
the post for a slightly longer time and in greater heat--eight hours
in 95 degrees--without food, water or bathroom breaks, and "suffered
lacerations, pain and swelling in his arms" as a result. Given this
legal precedent, the dissenting justices found no basis to think "it
should have been clear" to the guards in the Hope case that their
conduct was unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, the dissent would have a point. When courts consider
the liability of state officials for constitutional violations, they
generally look to previous cases to see whether the law was "clearly
established" and thus whether officials had "fair warning" that their
actions were illegal.</TE>
<TE>   But some actions are so obviously beyond the pale of acceptable
behavior toward others in a civilized society that ordinary common
sense about what acts are cruel is all one should need to know.</TE>
<TE>   True, the system worked in this case: Hope ultimately won his
appeal. But it took the U.S. Supreme Court to find in his favor. And
it should give us pause that three members of our highest court
looked at this case and saw no obvious cruelty.</TE>
<TE>   Would they have reached the same conclusion had it been a friend
or family member who had been chained to a post and left to roast for
hours in the sun? This question is only partly rhetorical. Judges
are, after all, the governmental officials whose assigned role in our
constitutional scheme is to check the excesses of the majority,
especially when those excesses are directed against politically
vulnerable minorities. To perform this role, they must rise above
popular prejudice and retain a capacity for empathy and
identification even with society's most despised members. Hope, a
convicted armed robber, is no angel. But he is a human being and
deserves to be treated like one.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, as the Hope dissent shows, judges can get so caught
up in the word games of the law that they forget it is fellow human
beings whose rights they are supposed to be protecting. There are few
people in our society as powerless, or as widely loathed, as
incarcerated offenders. If constitutional protections against abuses
of official power are to mean anything, the courts must take claims
of state overreaching brought by members of this group as seriously
as they take those of other citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Until judges at all levels are prepared to supplement their
formalistic legal reasoning and traditional deference to government
officials with a healthy dose of empathy for convicted criminals, we
can expect no shift in the current course of American criminal
justice.</TE>

<HD>60 Years After War, Life's a Beach on Midway</HD>
<DH>Geography: Sixty years after the U.S. defeated Japan to
secure a key port in World War II, 30 people call the isolated island
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>B.J. REYES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY ATOLL</DL>
<LD>For visitors who land on Midway, stepping off the plane 1,200 miles
from the next town is like stepping back in time.</LD>
<LD>   Silence is broken only by the resident avian population--thousands
upon thousands of gooney birds who greet arrivals with a wary stare
and a peck on the feet if they wander too close.</LD>
<LD>   Pristine beaches appear untouched by humans, beckoning newcomers
to a lagoon so clear it might as well be filled with bottled water.</LD>
<TE>   "It's so peaceful and serene," said 68-year-old Harold Willenborg,
who served in the Navy on this remotest of Pacific outposts from
1960-62. "That pristine beach--it is just fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   Sixty years ago, Midway was anything but serene. From June 4-6,
1942, it was the site of a pivotal World War II battle.</TE>
<TE>   For three days, American dive bombers and fighter pilots fended
off the Japanese naval fleet's attempt to secure Midway, sinking four
of the fleet's carriers.</TE>
<TE>   For the remainder of the war, the atoll provided a key port for
U.S. ships and submarines that allowed them to remain in the theater
of battle without having to return to Pearl Harbor or the U.S.
mainland for maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there is not even a car on Midway, only a bus and a van
that once shuttled tourists around. Getting around the 2.5 square
miles of Midway calls for a golf cart, a bicycle or--the preferred
method--walking.</TE>
<TE>   Scattered buildings, fueling stations, barracks and even a
shuttered shopping mall serve as a reminder of when the atoll served
as a Navy base and was home to about 1,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Now, about 30 people--mostly employees who oversee the atoll's
minimal infrastructure--call Midway home.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has been gone since 1993, replaced by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, which took over the atoll in 1996 as a national
wildlife refuge and contracted with a private company to offer public
access through environmental tours.</TE>
<TE>   But today there is no public access to the atoll. Midway Phoenix
Corp. and its 150 or so employees pulled out in March, citing high
operating costs. The government is in the process of finding a new
tour operator.</TE>
<TE>   "That will all come back to us eventually," said Tim Bodeen, the
refuge manager on Midway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a slow process. Everything at Midway, the time length
is always accentuated because logistically it's hard. You've just got
to learn to be very patient."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Bodeen and the rest of the population seem content in
their isolation.</TE>
<TE>   Supplies are flown in about once a month by a charter flight, and
once or twice a year a military supply ship passes by the atoll,
which is about 1,200 miles northwest of the main Hawaiian islands.</TE>
<TE>   There is no TV--who needs to watch "Survivor" in a setting like
this?</TE>
<TE>   There is no newspaper service.</TE>
<TE>   There is no long-distance telephone service. A single satellite
phone--which also services the island's sole Internet
computer--connects Midway to the outside world.</TE>
<TE>   To John Klavitter, that's not all bad.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't missed current events at all," said Klavitter, a
wildlife biologist for the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came out here, the war on terrorism was going on and for
me, in my mind, it sort of ended. I haven't thought about it in the
three months that I've been here.</TE>
<TE>   "In some ways, it's sort of refreshing. I know I have a patriotic
duty to be informed and so forth, but in some ways it puts me at
ease--I don't have as much to worry about."</TE>
<TE>   Bodeen has been living at Midway since January. His wife and two
daughters, ages 10 and 7, joined him last month for what they expect
to be a two- to three-year stay.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little concerned that I'm sort of falling off the map and I
won't be able to keep contact as easily, but I'm hoping that it'll be
OK," Stephanie Bodeen said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the length of their stay may depend on how home-schooling
goes with their children.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take her daughters long to get acquainted with the
island. The day they arrived they discovered most of what there is to
do.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the beaches, hiking trails and other outdoor
activities, a bowling alley and pottery shop, both leftover from the
Navy, have been restored, while some workers say they plan to try to
restore an old movie theater. There also is a music room and library.</TE>
<TE>   Former residents say the island is what you make of it.</TE>
<TE>   "You made your own fun," said Richard Kelley, 54, a former Navy
weather officer who lived on Midway with his wife and two young sons
from 1976-78.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a tiny American town--with nothing around for 1,200
miles."</TE>
<TE>   Others who have spent time on Midway say the key is building
friendships.</TE>
<TE>   "You get bonded out there," said former sailor Willenborg. "You've
got to be out there to know the camaraderie that goes on. You either
hated it or you loved it. Most of the people loved the island."</TE>
<TE>   He also discovered an added bonus: "There were no department
stores where your wife could spend money."</TE>
<TE>   Klavitter and his wife arrived on Midway from Kailua-Kona on the
Big Island of Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that we love about being out here is the commute," said
Klavitter, 33. "I commute three minutes on my bicycle to work versus
40 minutes in the car in Kona.</TE>
<TE>   "There is, I think, a lot more things that I love about being out
here versus things I miss."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Your lifestyle got totally adjusted," he said. "If you were into
nightclubs and parties and multiplex cinemas, that was not the place
to go. But if you're into family kind of things, the beach, outdoor
activities, that was the place to go.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a very, very different existence."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The site of the battle that turned the tide in favor of U.S. forces
in the Pacific 60 years ago, Midway Atoll today is a national
wildlife refuge.</LD>
<LD>   Background: The United States took formal possession of Midway in
1867. The laying of the transpacific cable, which passed through the
islands, brought the first residents in 1903. After the Battle of
Midway on June 4-6, 1942, the islands served as a naval station until
1993. In 1996, the atoll was turned over to the Interior Department
to be managed as a wildlife refuge. In 2000, the atoll was designated
the Battle of Midway National Memorial, as authorized by Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Location: Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, about 1,200 miles
northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands and one-third of the way from
Honolulu to Tokyo. The atoll includes Eastern Island, Sand Island and
Spit Island.</LD>
<TE>   Total area: 2.5 square miles, about nine times the size of the
Mall in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Population: No indigenous inhabitants; approximately 30 people
make up the staff that oversees the atoll under the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.</TE>
<TE>   Roads: 10 miles paved and two miles gravel.</TE>
<TE>   Buildings: Nearly 120 buildings, including cable company
buildings, maintenance shops, hangars, warehouses, barracks,
residences, cold storage, a theater and gymnasium. Most built from
1941-60.</TE>

<HD>Wildlife Researchers' Good Intentions Often Can Be Deadly
for Animals</HD>
<DH>Nature: Elk, antelope and lynx are among creatures that
failed to survive officials' rescue attempts. Critics blame fear and
poor planning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FOSTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMA, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Everything was going as planned, until elk began to die.</LD>
<LD>   A helicopter swooped in over the herd and a marksman leaned out,
firing tranquilizer darts at elk fleeing across the meadow. Animals
hit with darts soon began to weave and stumble, watched by workers
waiting to move in once they dropped.</LD>
<LD>   The capture, conducted in March to relocate wild elk from a
burgeoning population in western Washington to a failing herd 80
miles away, looked as if it would go without a hitch, wildlife
officials recall.</LD>
<TE>   Then one of the tranquilized elk bolted into a rain-swollen creek.
As narcotics coursed through its body, the normally strong swimmer
flailed about, drowning as its head slipped beneath the rushing
water.</TE>
<TE>   A second elk ran into the woods, staggering as the drugs took
effect. Pitching down, the animal buried its nostrils into soft earth
and lay there, unable to move, until it suffocated.</TE>
<TE>   Two other elk collapsed in the open, but by the time they were
blindfolded and strapped onto pallets for transport, they were having
trouble breathing. Their systems were shutting down from the trauma
of the chase and the drugs; they died within minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a side of wildlife research and management seldom seen by the
public: A surprising number of wild creatures are inadvertently
killed or injured by the scientists entrusted to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife biologists do more these days than venture into nature
with notepads and binoculars.</TE>
<TE>   Animals are chased, darted, netted, drugged, tagged, banded and
radio-collared. They are cut open and implanted with satellite
transmitters. They are caught in leghold traps, then released and
caught again.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions about how much death, injury and harassment to allow in
the pursuit of science are left largely to the wildlife managers and
researchers themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we lose an animal, it's not a good day," said Jack Smith,
who ran the elk capture for the Washington Department of Fish and
Wildlife. "But if you don't go into an operation expecting that
you're going to lose a few animals, then you're not being properly
realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Marc Bekoff disagrees. An animal-behavior expert who has written
books on the intelligence and emotional life of animals, he believes
researchers have obligations to the animals they study.</TE>
<TE>   "The methods you use are set up by the philosophy you have. If you
think it's OK to let individual animals die, it can be a
self-fulfilling prophecy."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife researchers often underestimate the effect they have on
their subjects, said Bekoff, who teaches biology at the University of
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "Wild animals are living on the edge," he said. "They're trying to
get food and water, they're trying to survive. They can't tolerate
stress."</TE>
<TE>   Some stressful moments in the wild:</TE>
<TE>   * In Colorado, efforts to reintroduce Canada lynx have been
particularly deadly. Four of the first five lynx released in 1999
died of starvation. Biologists later improved their methods,
fattening up lynx between their capture in Alaska or Canada and their
release in the Colorado Rockies, but even so, at least 42 of the 96
lynx released to date have died, and more than a dozen are missing.</TE>
<TE>   * In Alaska's Prince William Sound, satellite transmitters
surgically implanted in scoters in 1998 and 1999 led to the death of
about 40% of the sea ducks within two weeks. The implanted scoters
kept to themselves, away from their flock, making them easy pickings
for predators.</TE>
<TE>   * In Oregon, government biologists investigating the poor survival
rate of young pronghorn antelope made matters worse. Fourteen of the
20 pregnant pronghorns they captured in March 1997 died of "capture
myopathy," a wasting of muscle that can occur when animals overheat
from the trauma of being chased or handled.</TE>
<TE>   * In Kaktovik, Alaska, Eskimo villager Isaac Akootchook seethes
about government scientists who have buzzed around the nearby Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in recent years, studying wildlife for the
debate over oil drilling.</TE>
<TE>   One winter's day about four years ago, Akootchook said, a polar
bear wandered into town, acting strangely. Fearing for their safety,
villagers shot the bear and then noticed a radio collar around its
neck. Akootchook's photos show the bear's fur rubbed off by the
collar, its skin red and raw.</TE>
<TE>   "It was going to die," Akootchook said. "It got infected because
of the collar, and we couldn't even eat it."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife researchers say some mortality is inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   The day that four elk died in Washington, Smith's team
successfully captured 20 others, for a mortality rate of 17%.
Overall, the five-day relocation effort killed eight elk but
successfully moved 81, for a 9% mortality rate.</TE>
<TE>   "We would definitely do it again," Smith said. "We were within
what we consider acceptable limits."</TE>
<TE>   Smith said things have improved since earlier days of wildlife
research and management, when conservation of game animals was the
primary focus. In those days, since the animals studied were likely
to be shot later by hunters, there was less concern about killing
them in research. If the overall wildlife population increased, that
meant success, even if some individuals died along the way.</TE>
<TE>   This all's-well-that-ends-well philosophy still permeates research
and management, according to animal-rights activists. They argue that
wild animals should be viewed not as commodities but as beings with a
right to live free of undue suffering.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be more of a humane consideration in research," said
Michael Markarian, executive vice president of the Fund For Animals,
based in Maryland. "Researchers sometimes look at the species as a
whole without looking out for the welfare of the individual animal."</TE>
<TE>   John Pierce, chief scientist for the wildlife division of the
Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, said researchers have
grown more concerned about individual animals during the last 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   "In this day and age, it's a given that animal-welfare concerns
are a major part of our plans," Pierce said. "It's a matter of
ongoing attention, discussion and improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Ethical issues aside, intrusive research can change the behavior
that scientists hope to observe. Science journals are full of studies
documenting so-called instrument effects:</TE>
<TE>   * Wing tags induced ruddy ducks to spend less time courting and
more time sleeping.</TE>
<TE>   * Ear tags on white-footed mice kept them from grooming away
ticks.</TE>
<TE>   * Mallards wearing 1-ounce radio transmitters rested and preened
more, started their nests later and laid fewer and smaller eggs.</TE>
<TE>   * Scientists studying endangered Hawaiian honeycreepers used radio
transmitters with long, limp antennas, only to find birds hanging
helplessly from tree limbs, entangled by the antennas.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the sheer volume of research--even sensitive,
well-designed research--can cause problems.</TE>
<TE>   At Yellowstone National Park, one of the world's most intensely
studied natural areas, about 50 wildlife research projects are going
on at any given time. The airwaves are crowded with radio
transmissions from collared grizzlies, elk, coyotes, wolves, mountain
lions and bison.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard enough coordinating the scientists, never mind the
uninvited wildlife enthusiasts who cruise around the park with
illegal receivers, homing in on telemetry signals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're out there trying to do wolf recovery, and we're bumping
into people who are too close to these critters," said Glenn Plumb, a
park biologist.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Yellowstone is considered a model for research
that considers both animal welfare and the sensitivities of park
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   A full-time employee keeps track of research proposals, which must
be reviewed first by academic peers and then by a park committee that
includes rangers and naturalists, who must answer to visitors
protective of the park's wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in America's fields and forests, the level of official
scrutiny applied to wildlife research varies according to who's doing
it and where it's done--despite attempts by the federal government
and research organizations to set standards.</TE>
<TE>   Research institutions that receive federal money must establish
"animal care and use committees" to evaluate projects. Professional
groups including the Wildlife Society and the American Society of
Mammalogists also publish recommendations for good field techniques.</TE>
<TE>   "In theory, they're good guidelines," said Markarian, of the Fund
for Animals. "But usually they're mostly for looks. The committee
will be made up of researchers themselves. Once in a while, they'll
put a token animal-welfare person on there, but it's not the kind of
unbiased committee you'd hope for."</TE>
<TE>   Bekoff said state wildlife managers are subject to even less
formal review than academic researchers. He called Colorado officials
"unethical and disingenuous" for trying to reintroduce lynx while
knowing from the start that half their released animals might die.</TE>
<TE>   But other wildlife researchers say it's worth risking some death
and injury if there's a chance of helping a wildlife population
imperiled by human activities.</TE>
<TE>   "You hate to think you're learning at the expense of these
animals, but you realize it's never been done before," said Russell
George, director of Colorado's Division of Wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, study methods are improving. Telemetry devices for
tracking wildlife have grown smaller and lighter. Satellite tracking
allows researchers to monitor animals with less intrusion. New
immobilizing drugs have wider tolerances, so an overdose is less
likely to kill an animal.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have an obvious interest in reducing the number of
animals killed by their studies, Bekoff said, but they often neglect
another option: Leave the animals alone.</TE>
<TE>   Animal-rights advocates say concerns about career advancement, the
pressure to publish and the use-it-or-lose-it nature of grant money
can tempt scientists to engage in research that does more harm than
good.</TE>
<TE>   "A big question is deciding whether to do the work at all," Bekoff
said. "There's a bias toward doing things, because that's what they
get paid to do."</TE>

<HD>Karzai's Huge Task</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The grand council, or loya jirga, that established a transitional
government for Afghanistan demonstrated the problems and promise of a
nation devastated by more than two decades of war. Feuding among
ethnic factions, a staple of Afghan history, remains one of the
biggest problems. The willingness of more than 1,500 delegates to
spend a week debating visions of a future Afghanistan displayed the
potential for a broadly representative government.</LD>
<LD>   In December, foreign nations meeting in Bonn picked Hamid Karzai
as Afghanistan's interim ruler. Last month, Afghans in Kabul elected
Karzai president until the nation holds full-fledged elections in
2004. It's unfortunate that U.S. officials were so heavy-handed in
pushing aside opposition to Karzai and ensuring that the former king,
Mohammad Zaher Shah, remained on the sidelines. Still, Karzai has
done a good job in starting the rebuilding of his shattered country
and extracting promises of financial aid from foreign governments.</LD>
<TE>   He also did well to remove the Tajik interior minister and replace
him with a Pushtun, the nation's majority ethnic group. Tajiks still
wield disproportionate influence in Karzai's Cabinet, a recognition
of their major role in fighting the Taliban rulers for years before
the United States and its allies intervened after Sept. 11. If Karzai
wants the nation to view his Cabinet as representative, he needs to
correct the ethnic balance.</TE>
<TE>   He also must distance himself from the warlords trying to
establish fiefdoms throughout the country. The United States could
assist by ending its opposition to deploying international
peacekeepers anywhere in Afghanistan other than Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans angered at America's too-public support for Karzai were
enraged when U.S. aircraft last week accidentally killed dozens of
civilians while flying in support of troops hunting for Al Qaeda and
Taliban operatives. Such incidents are a part of all wars. U.S.
forces were quick to investigate why a gunship strafed the town--the
crew reported receiving antiaircraft fire--and to offer assistance to
those wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Such needless civilian casualties, of course, undercut the loya
jirga in its difficult job of deciding how to rebuild the nation's
political institutions. But the return of the Taliban or Al Qaeda
would be disastrous.</TE>
<TE>   After its 10-year war against Soviet invaders, years of fighting
between warlords and then U.S. intervention, what Afghanistan needs
most is the stability to educate its young, grow its crops, open
factories and create a peaceful civil society.</TE>

<LD>When Los Angeles County supervisors decided last month to close 11
public health clinics and an Antelope Valley hospital, low-income
patients told heartbreaking stories about having to travel 50 miles
or more to get care for serious diseases. Doctors, nurses and union
representatives warned of disease outbreaks and ever more crowded
emergency rooms. But no one offered a realistic alternative for
easing the county Department of Health Services' looming $800-million
deficit.</LD>
<LD>   With two federal bailouts behind them, the county supervisors know
they lack credibility when it comes to asking for help. Looking back
to 1995, the last time the health department faced collapse, you'll
see that many of the problems existing then still have not been
fixed--among them computers that don't talk with each other and
department officials who don't talk with each other.</LD>
<TE>   In part because the department's situation is so hopeless, there
finally are hopeful signs that the supervisors will give newly hired
health chief Thomas Garthwaite the backing he needs to fix what's
broken. The board agrees, for example, to a major reorganization that
will concentrate transplants and other specialized treatments at
County-USC Hospital, a practice that should improve patient care but
upsets the balance of power among hospitals in different districts.
But even the best of managers cannot single-handedly fix the even
bigger problem, one the entire nation is pretending doesn't exist:
How are millions of people who don't have medical insurance supposed
to pay for care?</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 2 million L.A. County residents lack insurance, more
than the entire populations of 15 states. They are not freeloaders
but the working poor. Eighty percent of the 800,000 patients treated
each year at county clinics and hospitals work at low-paying jobs
that don't offer insurance. They don't qualify for public programs
like Medi-Cal. Without county hospitals and health clinics, their
only safety net would be hospital emergency rooms. And emergency
rooms, public and private, are already so overwhelmed and underfunded
that they're turning away even patients with insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The federal bailouts encouraged treatment at cost-efficient
primary-care clinics rather than at costly hospitals. Once the aid
package runs out in 2005, the federal government will go back to
reimbursing the county for hospital stays but not for preventive and
primary care. The Bush administration supports giving states
flexibility in spending federal money. California's government
leaders must convince U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy
G. Thompson, who as governor of Wisconsin favored local innovation,
to give L.A. County the money and flexibility it needs to keep the
doors open--after it proves it can be innovative and flexible itself.</TE>

<LD>This month and next are prime family vacation travel times for
Americans, many of whom put themselves in the confines of one car for
their longest time together of the year. Here, in the interests of
promoting family safety and harmony, is Version I of a special Family
Automobile Vacation Examination not available at any Department of
Motor Vehicles examination station.</LD>
<LD>   1. You are a father loading the car for a two-week automobile
vacation and realize your teenage daughter is bringing sufficient
clothing for a year abroad. You should: a) honk the horn repeatedly,
b) flee the scene, c) loudly comment on this to both sons or d)
secretly consult your spouse.</LD>
<LD>   2. You are a mother in the kitchen packing the cooler with fruit
and healthful drinks when your husband announces the trunk is full
just with your daughter's suitcases. You should: a)  quietly question
her on the need for so many outfits just for the backseat, b)
remember to pack the Aleve, c) suggest that both boys leave behind
their CDs, Gameboys and underwear to make room for their sister's
stuff or d) flee the scene.</LD>
<TE>   3. You're a mother inspecting children's luggage and find a nest
of rap and hip-hop CDs just as your husband says how much he's
anticipating the bliss of no upstairs bedrooms blaring teen music.
You should: a) remember to pack the Excedrin, b) force every
breathing child to prove this instant that headphones are packed, c)
remind your husband that his parents said the same thing about the
Grateful Dead or d) flee after looking over your shoulder to ensure
safe entry to roadway.</TE>
<TE>   4. You're driving along an interstate when a Jeep passes you
overflowing with orange-haired punkers with studded noses and denim
jackets who begin waving and shouting at someone sitting behind you.
You should: a) casually ask your daughter to close her window, b)
inform your sons that if they make the slightest gesture they're
grounded until 2008, c) launch a loud, distracting rendition of your
favorite Supremes song or d) point out the large, empty farm field on
the right.</TE>
<TE>   5. At 74 miles an hour, at dusk on the first day out, all of you
are four minutes into immense ice cream cones when you realize you
forgot to make the motel reservation. You should: a) tell your wife

<HD>Canada Scam Artists Have a Global Reach</HD>
<DH>Telemarketing: Phone fraud rings operating north of the
border dupe thousands in the U.S. and other countries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Overwhelmed by guilt and shame after being defrauded by telemarketers
of more than $50,000, Rose Urbanski could not face the ordeal of
telling her family what she'd done. So the Bay Area woman got a gun
and shot herself.</LD>
<LD>   The crooks who fleeced Urbanski have been convicted and
face prison terms. But there are plenty more where they came from:
Canada.</LD>
<LD>   In the largest cities north of the border, telemarketing fraud is
a thriving cottage industry that dupes thousands of U.S. senior
citizens out of untold millions each year. Protected by distance from
their victims, con artists also exploit Canada's lenient stance on
white-collar crime and the daunting logistics of dragging them across
the border to face trial in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   The strength of the U.S. dollar--worth about 1.5 Canadian
dollars--has made the scams more attractive. And from their sanctuary
in Canada, the crooks are extending their reach, targeting the
elderly in England and Australia as well as in the U.S., officials
say.</TE>
<TE>   "Across-border [fraud] is getting worse, and ... now England
is the target," said Gus LaForge, a spokesman for PhoneBusters, a
Canadian database for telemarketing complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California finds itself at both ends of the problem. The
region long has been a mecca for home-grown phone fraud schemes,
which mainly target victims in other states. But with its large
population of affluent senior citizens, California also has been a
prime hunting ground for the cross-border rings.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles has won convictions in
five cross-border cases in the last three years and has charges
pending in six. Of the 93 U.S. attorneys' offices, those in Los
Angeles and Harrisburg, Pa., have been most aggressive in pursuing
the rings. But overall, authorities concede, there have been too few
prosecutions to drive the grifters out of business.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud rings run the gamut from the large and sophisticated to
seat-of-the-pants operations. Nailing the ringleaders is not fully
effective because it's easy for their accomplices to start up on
their own.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing they need is a chair and a cell phone," said
Sylvain L'Heureux of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</TE>
<TE>   Fighting back against the swindlers, Canadian and U.S. authorities
have joined forces in three anti-fraud task forces--one each for the
Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver areas, where the cross- border rings
are concentrated.</TE>
<TE>   Staffed mainly by the RCMP and other Canadian police and consumer
agencies, along with smaller contingents from the FBI, U.S. Customs
Service and U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the task forces have made
inroads--shutting down boiler rooms, seizing assets and intercepting
and returning checks to victims.</TE>
<TE>   A Daunting Task</TE>
<TE>   But the fraud rings are so numerous and mobile that many have met
with little interference, authorities concede.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much of this, and we're just scratching the surface,"
said Laureen France, an investigator with the Federal Trade
Commission in Seattle, which also is involved in the crackdown.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisdictional barriers also limit the punishment the scam artists
fear most: prison time in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The fraud rings rely on a maze of business names, bank accounts
and mail drops, along with a repertoire of telephone aliases--all
designed to throw authorities off the track. Highly mobile, they also
have a frustrating habit of shifting locations every few months.</TE>
<TE>   Working from "sucker lists" of potential victims, some schemes
involve bogus investments, while others con the financially desperate
out of advance fees for loans they never get.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most outrageous are "recovery room" schemes that bring the
joyous news that victims' losses from a previous scam have been
recovered through a class-action lawsuit. They need only send a check
to cover legal or administrative fees, at which point they are
victimized again.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. senior citizens have suffered the heaviest losses in
schemes offering cash jackpots in sweepstakes or lotteries run from
Australia, England or Spain. Victims are told that with the
telemarketer's special system, they have an excellent chance of
winning or already have won a big prize. To collect, they must send a
few hundred to a few thousand dollars to cover taxes or currency
exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Once they have paid, victims are informed that they have qualified
for an even larger prize but must send additional fees or relinquish
the jackpot to somebody else.</TE>
<TE>   The con men have mastered the art of making "people fear feeling
stupid for not participating in what appears to be a good
opportunity," said Mike Hartman, a U.S. postal inspector who works
with the Toronto task force.</TE>
<TE>   Some crooks have posed as customs agents, telling victims that
their prizes are being held at the border until their tax payments
are received. Others claim to be working with the FBI to "shut down
different gimmicks and scams," as one said in a taped conversation
with an Orange County victim.</TE>
<TE>   Crime's Human Toll</TE>
<TE>   As victims go, Rose Urbanski, who was 70 when she killed herself
in March 2000, was younger than most.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom was a very bright woman," said her daughter, Sandy
Grisolio, who lives in Orange. "I can't even imagine how she got
involved in this."</TE>
<TE>   Her death also came as a shock to Mark Beauchamp, a customs agent
who had interviewed Urbanski while investigating those who conned
her. Alarmed when Urbanski spoke of suicide, Beauchamp thought he had
talked her out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously [her death] was distressing, and I felt very bad for
the family," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although suicide is rare, the emotional and financial toll on
victims often is profound.</TE>
<TE>   "It has really knocked my mom down in the dirt--I
mean, financially wiped her out," said Larry Jones of San Luis Obispo,
whose 85-year-old mother, Leah Larsen, lost at least $140,000 in one
of the scams. "If there's any way for these guys to sit behind bars
for the rest of their lives, so they're not going to be robbing
elderly people like my mother, then I think that's a really good
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ellyn M. Lindsay, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles
who specializes in prosecuting telemarketing fraud: "It's not just
money; it's a complete personal betrayal and the devastating loss of
self-confidence that you could be taken in this way."</TE>
<TE>   Senior citizens' sense of self-worth "is on the wane, anyway,"
Lindsay said. "They look at this and say, 'You know what? I am old
and I can't take care of myself anymore.' ... You see, over and over,
people just ending up in nursing homes after this."</TE>
<TE>   The task forces took shape after complaints reached such a
crescendo in 1997 that then-President Clinton and Canadian Prime
Minister Jean Chretien ordered that something be done.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the task forces have closed scores of
boiler rooms and made dozens of arrests, intercepted and returned
millions of dollars to victims and frozen swindlers' assets. Project
Emptor, the Vancouver task force, has used British Columbia's consumer
fraud statute to seize $30 million in cash, real estate, luxury cars
and boats. With court approval, the loot will be divvied up among
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making a difference," said Sgt. Barry R. Baxter of the RCMP
and head of Project Emptor. "We've taken $30 million of their toys."</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say tough prison terms, the best deterrent, have
been far too infrequent.</TE>
<TE>   In Canada, financial crimes typically draw a sentence of probation
or fines. Even when criminals are jailed, they become eligible for
release after serving one-sixth of a provincial sentence or one-third
of a federal prison term.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., though also criticized as too tolerant of white-collar
crimes, is draconian by comparison. Federal laws provide enhanced
penalties for telemarketing fraud and for scams that target the
elderly. In the U.S., moreover, inmates must serve at least 85% of a
federal prison term.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the swindlers have drawn tough sentences in the U.S. One
ringleader got 11 years in New Jersey and another got 10 years in
Florida; in Los Angeles, two Vancouver-area con men got prison
sentences of seven years and of five years, 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   But jurisdictional red tape is a heavy drag on such cases.</TE>
<TE>   One obstacle involves treaty requirements for transferring
evidence seized in Canada to U.S. federal authorities. To get such
evidence, federal prosecutors must file a request that is scrutinized
first by the Justice Department's office of international affairs and
then by the Canadian justice department. Then the request must be
approved by a Canadian judge, over the objections of defense lawyers.
The process easily can take a year or more.</TE>
<TE>   Extradition often is more time-consuming, potentially taking at
least three years for defendants to exhaust their appeals. This
leaves plenty of opportunity for elderly victims to die or lose their
memories before they can testify. Indeed, extradition is such a
barrier that authorities have had their best luck nabbing suspects
who rashly stepped onto U.S. soil--including those who crossed the
border to do their banking, to vacation at Disney World or to make
house calls on victims.</TE>
<TE>   Suspect on the Move</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to exploiting the international border, Dillon
Sherif wrote the book.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi-born telemarketer originally was known as
Nuraldin Shareef Karim, but then borrowed a more dashing alias from
lawman-hero Matt Dillon of TV's "Gunsmoke" fame.</TE>
<TE>   A man who draped himself in elegant clothes and drove a
canary-yellow Ferrari, the 40-year-old Sherif also was meticulous
about his work. A notebook seized last year in a raid on his
Vancouver operation contained entries on keeping his aliases
straight, including the reminder: "My name used Mario Lopez." Another
entry sized up a target: "She desperately wants to help her children
who are 'crashing' economically.... She has back trouble but I think
she also has $'s!!--go for big play."</TE>
<TE>   Maud Noble, a Beverly Hills senior citizen, was contacted by a
"George Thomas"--in reality, Sherif or one of his minions,
authorities say. Noble remembered him as a polite and
religious-sounding man who said things like "bless you" all the time.
He sent Noble a dozen red roses--this, after persuading her to
liquidate her investments to send him $55,000.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a very good actor," Noble said. "I couldn't forgive myself
for such a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Sherif settled a pair of government lawsuits by agreeing
to a court order barring him from pitching lottery chances.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, however, Sherif turned up in Spain, where he
allegedly resumed targeting the elderly. Spanish authorities arrested
him in June 1999 on charges of defrauding victims of $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   After gaining his release, however, Sherif skipped bail and fled
Spain for Vancouver. With the Spanish arrest warrant hanging over his
head, the tireless Sherif set up shop again in his old stomping
ground.</TE>
<TE>   With cash from the United States pouring in, Sherif was arrested
in October on a criminal complaint from the U.S. attorney in Los
Angeles. Although Sherif was accused of violating the 1998 court
order, of skipping out on his trial in Spain and of stashing large
sums in Costa Rican and Panamanian accounts, his lawyer argued that
he should be allowed to post bail. The Canadian court agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian prosecutor had warned that Sherif was a serious
flight risk and should be held pending extradition. But British
Columbia Supreme Court Justice Bryan F. Ralph decided instead to set
bail at $200,000 and require Sherif to surrender his passport.</TE>
<TE>   Sherif quickly vanished. Soon after his disappearance, education
officials in Syria requested the school records of his children. U.S.
and Canadian authorities believe he is in that Middle Eastern
country.</TE>
<TE>   A court spokesman said Justice Ralph had no reason to think Sherif
would flee, particularly after surrendering his travel documents.
"Despite that fact, he took off," which is "something that no judge
on Earth is able to anticipate," spokesman Lloyd McKenzie said.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay, the assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, was livid.</TE>
<TE>   "When we caught him, he was doing it [telemarketing fraud] again,
in violation of the [court] order." Yet "the judge in Canada sees fit
to release the guy, with this history ... who has millions of dollars
offshore."</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to do this to more people. He'll do it from wherever
he can get a freakin' telephone. And we had him," Lindsay said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see how our attempts to deal with this problem are
hindered by the international aspect."</TE>

<HD>Homeland Security--a Burden and a Boon</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>James Flanigan</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government is launching a new industry called homeland
security, with proposed spending of $38 billion, even as economists
debate whether such expenditure will drag or spur the economy.</LD>
<LD>   About 2% of the federal budget for fiscal 2003 is devoted to
increased spending on police and fire department equipment and
training, hiring air marshals and equipping airports, on
anti-biological terror programs and knitting up the nation with
uniform communications systems. Washington will be writing thousands
of contracts for private industry.</LD>
<LD>   These new expenditures will have a broad effect over the next five
years. Of course, a homeland defense industry already is operating,
thanks to $22 billion of extra spending in the current fiscal year as
a direct result of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</LD>
<TE>   But with more detailed plans for programs in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, the homeland security business promises to go big
time. Prospects are good for traditional security firms, but also for
providers of communications and computing systems, face-recognition
devices, vaccines and medicines, sensors and all sorts of defense
paraphernalia and software.</TE>
<TE>   However, the new industry imposes costs on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Delays for security checks have changed patterns in business
travel and tourism since Sept. 11 and hurt the airlines and related
industries. Manufacturing and retail industries are seeing delays in
the transportation of goods and added inventory costs as a
consequence of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   And incidents like the Fourth of July shootings in the Tom Bradley
International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport may lead
to further restrictions on airport access and air travel.</TE>
<TE>   Even the benefits of new budget expenditures are questioned.</TE>
<TE>   "Resources spent on homeland defense are being diverted from
other, possibly higher productivity purposes," says David Resler,
chief economist of Nomura Securities International.</TE>
<TE>   If the nation didn't have to spend on security, there might be
more money available to invest in producing consumer goods and
services to improve the civilian economy, Resler says, repeating an
argument frequently made in economic circles.</TE>
<TE>   But others argue that expenditures made for military purposes can
change the economy in unpredictable but beneficial ways.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Dangermond, founder and chairman of Environmental Systems
Research Institute Inc. (ESRI), a Redlands-based company that
provides maps of utility lines, water systems and other strategic
operations to government agencies, sees a new national communications
network in the same light as the Interstate Highway System, which was
launched in 1954 as the National Defense Highway.</TE>
<TE>   "That system ... was built for defense. But it has proved a great
boon to commerce," Dangermond notes.</TE>
<TE>   A broad range of industries will be affected by increases in
federal expenditure on security.</TE>
<TE>   "New budget spending will start programs that will grow over the
next five years," predicts Don Dickson, head of Market Access
International, an Arlington, Va.-based consulting firm on government
contracts and publisher of Homeland Defense Journal, an online
newsletter.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional security industry was growing 7% a year before
Sept. 11; now it is expanding at an annual pace of 12% to 15%. Large
international companies have been acquiring smaller ones as a
fragmented industry consolidates. Securitas of Sweden acquired
Pinkerton's agency in 1999 and Burns detective agency in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Wackenhut Corp., a Palm Beach, Fla.-based security firm with $2.8
billion in sales, agreed just before Sept. 11 to be acquired by Group
4 Falck of Copenhagen. The deal, which has been completed, created a
giant firm with more than $5 billion in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Security is going far beyond night watchman services.</TE>
<TE>   "Chief executives now take responsibility for company security,
rather than lower-level departments," says Enrique Hernandez Jr.,
chairman of Inter-Con Security Systems, a Pasadena-based firm that
protects State Department facilities and private property in the U.S.
and abroad. Its revenue is approaching $1 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   These top executives are asking how best to protect their premises
and employees, and are willing to spend on new computer and
communications systems to do so, says Neil Martou, vice president of
business development for Inter-Con.</TE>
<TE>   Security demands will spawn new technologies and applications in
many fields. Proposed federal spending of $3.5 billion to equip and
train police and fire departments will bring increased business to
Motorola Inc. and other government suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   "Motorola is all over homeland security; that's its original
business, " Dickson says.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola got its start in 1928 supplying car radios to Chicago's
police department. Today, the company has more than $5 billion in
sales--15% of its annual total-- supplying communications systems to
governments here and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry will be pushed to develop vaccines and
new medicines by the $5.9 billion in spending the government proposes
for research on anti-biological terror systems. The National
Institutes of Health will receive $3.5 billion more for research
grants, bringing its total budget to $27 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Defense contractors such as Raytheon Co., Lockheed Martin Corp.
and General Dynamics Corp. will adapt sophisticated sensors, thermal
imaging equipment and other military devices to civilian use.</TE>
<TE>   Information industry giants such as IBM Corp., Oracle Corp. and
Microsoft Corp. will help supply integrated national communications
systems linking city, state and federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Small to medium-size companies will get a lot of contracts too.
For example, the Geomet Technologies subsidiary of Versar Inc., a
Springfield, Va., engineering firm with $40 million in sales, has
just been granted a $3.5-million U.S Department of Agriculture
contract to design a safe system for destroying crops or foodstuffs
damaged in a bio-terror attack.</TE>
<TE>   Visionics Corp., a developer of face-recognition software that had
$30 million in sales last year, already is designated for an
undisclosed amount of new contracts from the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   Visionics, based in Minnetonka, Minn., has just merged with
Identix Inc., a producer of fingerprint recognition software that had
$81 million in sales last year and is moving its headquarters from
Los Gatos, Calif., to Minnetonka.</TE>
<TE>   And ESRI makes computerized maps that can show in real time the
effect of disruption or contamination on a city's electrical grid or
street and water systems. The company is confident of new business in
homeland security, Dangermond says. The privately held firm has $500
million in annual revenue.</TE>
<TE>   ESRI's New York offices are blocks away from ground zero, and the
company helped restore New York's municipal emergency systems after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   As a new industry, homeland security will take many forms. But
would the economy be better off without all this new business being
done? The question can be only theoretical, because real terror
attacks killed more than 3,000 people on Sept. 11 and imposed new
security costs on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that the heightened need for security will spur new
developments that expand the gross domestic product also are part of
the real consequences of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It is no consolation that other countries live with the need for
homeland security precautions. Britain, Israel, most of Europe, Asia,
Latin America and Africa have known terrorist attacks, and the costs
of guarding against them impinge on their economies.</TE>
<TE>   Some economists maintain that new charges for security are ones we
should have been paying all along, that threats to our civilization
always were there but we didn't take account of them.</TE>
<TE>   Debatable points aside, however, the facts are that homeland
security is imposing new costs on our economy, and paying them will
give rise to a diverse new industry.</TE>

<TE>   There should be retroactive laws against any of the top
brass--including directors, CEOs and chief financial
advisors--keeping any money from a company that he or she manipulated
illegally for personal gain. All the money that we would take away
from these scoundrels could be put to good use to help pay the
parties they damaged and, if any is left, to pay down the national
debt.</TE>
<TE>   And they should not only have their ill-gotten money confiscated,
but they should go to jail too.</TE>

<TE>   Congress does not need to enact new laws over the business
scandals. Those business leaders doctoring the books are doing it to
enhance their pay through bonuses, etc. Since they obtain those
bonuses through fraud, their taking of them constitutes grand theft.</TE>
<TE>   It is similar to bank robbery without a gun. All that is needed is
a change in mind-set and enforcement of laws that already exist.</TE>

<TE>   Penalize Firms That Play Hide-and-Seek With IRS</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that if the IRS is free to estimate tax on waiters'
tips ["IRS Can Estimate Tip Income, Justices Rule," June 18], it
should be able to estimate and assess a tax for U.S. businesses that
use Bermuda and other places to avoid paying any federal income tax.</TE>
<TE>   But give them a choice: Pay the estimated tax as assessed by the
IRS or move their headquarters back into the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Also, if they stay in their offshore location, even if they pay
the tax, they should not be able to receive any subsidies or
contracts from the federal government.</TE>

<TE>   Music Artists Entitled</TE>
<TE>   to Health Benefits</TE>
<TE>   I have no idea what business letter writer Stephen Scott King is
in, but his letter is so full of misinformation he must not be in the
music business ["Entertainers Can Take Care of Themselves," June 23].</TE>
<TE>   First of all, it is not only artists of color who are complaining
about the lack of health insurance coverage but artists, producers,
songwriters and others--black, white and brown.</TE>
<TE>   Second, until Bill Clinton's presidency, there were
preexisting-condition exemptions in nearly all American health-care
plans that were not obtained through union membership.</TE>
<TE>   Third, why is it "paternalism," to use Mr. King's word, for Sony
Music Entertainment Inc. or Warner Bros. Records to cover those who
allow them to have something to sell (i.e. music) but not paternalism
for an auto maker to provide its employees with insurance?</TE>
<TE>   Additional benefits? These are not additional benefits. Such
coverage is mandated by the agreements the major labels have with the
unions. The labels have simply ignored paying and the unions have
been too timid to demand.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it's not OK to pay agreed-to health benefits but it is OK
to advance Michael Jackson upward of $30 million to record one album?
Mr. King, are you complaining about that cost to the consumer?</TE>

<TE>   Time for Ford to Fix Safety Problems</TE>
<TE>   Re: "Recall Pressure Rises Against Ford" [June 22]:</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. states concerns, regarding the Crown Victoria
police cruiser, that "the [corrective] measures might create safety
problems, such as a shield that might puncture the tank in a crash."</TE>
<TE>   One must remember that this is the same firm whose internal memos
indicate that, a generation ago, they conducted a study to determine
whether it would be cheaper to pay off lawsuits than correct the
fuel-tank deficiencies of the Pinto, defects that were causing
numerous horrific, burned-alive deaths in those cars.</TE>
<TE>   Any mechanical engineer would laugh at Ford's suggestion that even
a well-engineered and tested shield could create more safety issues
than it would solve. More important, perhaps Ford underestimates our
collective memory as well as our intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   For their "fix" for the Pinto years ago--which they undertook only
after an extended pummeling by both regulators and the media--was to
install a flat plastic shield between the tank and rear axle, as was
done on my car.</TE>
<TE>   So is Ford now saying their fix for the Pinto was in error? If
not, then what exactly are they saying?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's time for Ford to extricate its corporate foot from
its mouth and simply fix the problem, preventing a few more officers
from being cremated.</TE>

<TE>   Restrictions on Radio</TE>
<TE>   Consolidation Needed</TE>
<TE>   A Times story says Clear Channel Communications Inc. President
Mark P. Mays believes that consolidation in the radio industry--in
which the top 10 station owners generate 44% of the industry's
revenue, is somehow just and proper ["Bill Seeks Limits on Radio
Giants," June 28].</TE>
<TE>   He resists Sen. Russell Feingold's proposed restrictions on
broadcasting. Mays says this percentage is appropriate because it
still is less than in other industries, such as movies and cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   Methinks Mr. Mays doth protest too much and perhaps quite
unwisely, as he fails to take into consideration the limited number
of available frequencies on the public airwaves.</TE>

<HD>Credit Counseling Less Costly Than Debt-Settlement Services</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: After I lost my job, I got talked into using a
debt-settlement service, the kind that helps you pay off your bills
for less than what you owe. The firm assured me and my wife that our
credit would recover quickly after all debts were paid off. I now
know we were naive to believe them. But how long will it take our
credit to recover from what we've done?</LD>
<LD>   I'm now employed and have a good income, as does my wife. We own
our home and have two credit cards, one with no balance and one for
unplanned purchases that never has a balance greater than $500.
Knowing how long our credit is going to suffer from this will help us
do some planning for the future.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Two to four years of good credit behavior--on-time
payments, no new accounts and light use of your credit cards--should
help undo some of the damage, but the black marks will remain on your
credit report for seven years.</LD>
<TE>   It's too bad you didn't sign up with a nonprofit consumer credit
counseling service rather than with a debt-settlement firm. Credit
counseling services set up a debt-repayment plan and negotiate lower
interest rates with your creditors so you can pay your debts back in
full.</TE>
<TE>   Debt settlement firms, by contrast, ask your creditors to accept
less than what they're owed--that is, if they even stick around to
fulfill their part of the deal. Some settlement firms simply
disappear with the hefty $3,000 to $5,000 payment they typically
demand up front.</TE>
<TE>   The difference to your credit rating is immense. Credit counseling
in the vast majority of cases does not affect your three-digit credit
score, which is used by many lenders to evaluate your
creditworthiness. Your creditors may put a note in your credit report
saying you're participating in a debt-repayment plan, but the leading
credit scorer, Fair, Isaac &amp; Co., ignores that information when
computing your score.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've completed the plan, your lenders remove the notation
and no one looking at your credit report would know that you were
ever on a repayment plan.</TE>
<TE>   With debt settlement, however, your creditors typically report
that you've paid less than you owed. That stays on your record for
seven years and lowers your credit score. What's more, that
"forgiven" debt may be considered taxable income to you. So in
addition to trashing your credit report, you also may have a hefty
tax bill to pay.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably not too late to contact the lenders who haven't yet
settled and make arrangements to pay them in full. It won't undo the
damage that's already been done, but it could prevent matters from
getting worse.</TE>
<TE>   Timing Is a Factor in</TE>
<TE>   Mark-to-Market Move</TE>
<TE>   Q: Several months ago you answered a question from someone who had
quit his job to become a day trader, only to lose tens of thousands
of dollars in the stock market. He wanted to offset these losses
against his wife's income, but you told him he was limited to writing
off $3,000 in capital losses each year, so it probably would take him
years to use up all of his red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Why didn't you tell him about the mark-to-market election traders
can make, which allows full-time traders to write off all their
losses in a given year?</TE>
<TE>   A: Two reasons. One, it was far too late for him to make this
election. And two, once the election is made, any subsequent gains
must be reported and taxed, even if the underlying investments
haven't been sold.</TE>
<TE>   The mark-to-market election allows true full-time stock traders to
treat their holdings as though they had been sold at the end of the
year, even if they weren't. Any paper gains or losses are treated as
though they actually occurred. That means traders can write off the
full value of any losses, but they have to pay taxes on the full
value of any gains.</TE>
<TE>   This election has to be made in advance, however--by the due date
of the previous year's return, to be precise. The man who wrote in
would have had to opt for mark-to-market treatment for his 2001
trading by the due date of his year 2000 return.</TE>
<TE>   Take Steps to Prove</TE>
<TE>   Out-of-State Residency</TE>
<TE>   Q: My wife and I are going to retire in a couple of years and we
want to move to a place with no state income tax but keep our home in
California for occasional visits. If we register to vote and buy a
home to live in the other state, do we still have to pay California
state taxes on our pensions because we have decided to keep our home
here?</TE>
<TE>   A: Tread very carefully in this area.</TE>
<TE>   California no longer is able to tax the pensions of former
residents who move out of state--something it used to do with relish,
but which ended when former President Clinton put the kibosh on the
practice. (Other states had been pursuing retirees too, but perhaps
none as aggressively as the Golden State.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, California tax authorities don't like to let money get away
from them. If they can prove you're still a resident of the state,
you'll get taxed. You'll want to spend the bulk of your time out of
state, and you may need to take other steps to verify that you're
really no longer a resident.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, chat with a good tax professional who stays
current on residency issues.</TE>

<HD>Seller's Market Tightens as Homeowners Won't Let Go</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Worried about the economy or finding another
house, many are staying put, fueling the plunge in Southland
inventories.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With record home prices and abundant prospective home buyers, it's a
great time for many Southern Californians to sell their homes and
either move up or take a profit.</LD>
<LD>   It's not happening.</LD>
<LD>   Worried about their jobs and the economy, or afraid they won't
find anything to buy, or waiting for prices to go even higher,
homeowners in surprising numbers are refusing to sell or are taking
their homes off the market.</LD>
<TE>   This phenomenon, happening across the country but more pronounced
in the Southland, is contributing to the record low inventories that
have gotten progressively lower for four years.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners who won't let go are jamming the gears of one of the
all-time great real estate booms, discouraging buyers and frustrating
agents who easily could be collecting more commissions if they had
more homes to sell.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who want to sell know they can find a buyer," said
John L. Williams, a real estate agent at Remax Real Estate Services
in Monarch Beach. "The only question for the seller is: Now what?"</TE>
<TE>   For Roberta Willis, the answer came while sifting through the
market for two months. After poring over scraps of listings, she
canceled an escrow sale of her home in Covina.</TE>
<TE>   A buyer had agreed to purchase her home for $231,500, or $1,500
above the asking price. But she figured that another residence of
similar size, in good condition, would cost at least $300,000. That
was more money than she was willing to spend, and she found nothing
for less that appealed to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw dumps," said Willis, 62, who wanted to move closer to her
daughter in Whittier. "The prices on houses were ridiculous. You move
in and you need $30,000 to fix up the place. I said to my agent, 'I'm
not going to do it.' My days of fixing up houses are gone."</TE>
<TE>   Willis, who retired from a bookbinding job this year, said she
ignores real estate agents who keep asking whether she will put her
home back on the market. She plans to stick around, enjoying a deck
she added a few years ago that overlooks peach and apricot trees.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't sell this house again," Willis said.</TE>
<TE>   Many would-be sellers share her frustrations or have other reasons
for holding back, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowners may be reluctant to sell because they feel
insecure about their incomes as uncertainty clouds the nation's
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Though much of Southern California posted unemployment rates of
about 5% or less, Los Angeles County was worse than the state average
with 6.8% unemployed in the latest report. With California's economy
still mending, some people have been leery of taking on new
mortgages.</TE>
<TE>   Still, employment has been more abundant in Southern California
than in many other parts of the country. This cuts the number of
people who must sell their homes to accept a new position in another
state, a more common occurrence during the recession of the early
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Others may intend to sell but hope to time their deals with the
very top of the market. Prices have set new records three months in a
row, jumping nearly 17% in May from a year ago. It was the sixth
consecutive month of double-digit increases. Some sellers have grown
convinced that the longer they wait, the more they'll make.</TE>
<TE>   Rising prices have given owners another reason to stay put:
equity. With the value of their homes climbing, they can borrow
against that capital at low interest rates, or refinance their
mortgage and lower their monthly payments. They can use the money to
fix up their homes, adding space or amenities.</TE>
<TE>   And as has been true for years, people who owned their homes
before the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 have a disincentive to
sell because they probably would face substantially higher property
taxes if they moved to another home in California.</TE>
<TE>   The result of these factors has been fewer homes on the market.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, the number of listings in May dropped 39%
from a year earlier, while Orange County's fell by nearly a third,
according to the California Assn. of Realtors.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agents have devised bold gambits--both high and low
tech--to attract sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bents, whose real estate team targets households along
Newport Bay, sends a sand-textured brochure promoting his services to
1,500 households every month. He also mails postcards that show how
much nearby homes have sold for and follows up with an automated
phone program that calls those residents and leaves messages
describing recent sales.</TE>
<TE>   A Valencia real estate agent, Neal Weichel, has used new-home
construction as a lure for listings. In April he hosted 130 former
clients to meet with the developer of Westridge, an upscale community
scheduled to open this year in Valencia. Over a spread of carved ham
and turkey, fruits and cheeses, the homeowners were shown floor
plans, exterior sketches and other details of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Weichel heard from 25 people who had expressed interest
in hiring him to market their current residence so they could buy one
of the new homes. "I've never done anything like that before," said
Weichel, who spent $7,000 to hold the event in a hotel conference
room, "but you have to think outside of the box."</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners have learned the same lesson. Some properties have sold
so quickly that sellers have spent weeks with relatives or in hotel
rooms while hunting for another place to live. And a growing number
of them have sought protection through contingency clauses.</TE>
<TE>   Brad and Jeanette Stephen have received a handsome offer for their
home in Mission Viejo but are buffered from closing the deal by a
60-day agreement allowing them to back out if they fail to find a
replacement. They were outbid twice this year for houses they wanted
and fear being stuck indefinitely in an apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to miss out on buying something because prices have
moved out of our range," said Brad Stephen, who juggles ownership of
a small trucking company with managing his father's spray-painting
business.</TE>
<TE>   The Stephens still believe they can find a house before the
deadline. But other would-be sellers have ended their search for a
home that would be a move up, convinced that nothing exists in their
price range worth buying.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon and Harlan Klipp scoured the Pasadena area for a year and
came up empty. "If we found something that was similar to what we
have, we would have moved," said Sharon Klipp, 47, a registered
dental assistant.</TE>
<TE>   The Klipps probably will stay put and secure a loan that lets them
borrow against the equity in a Pasadena home they've owned for 16
years. Expanding the den, updating the kitchen and adding a
half-bathroom will cost thousands less than buying a larger house,
Sharon Klipp said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't move for any of the homes I've seen, and they're all
$75,000 to $150,000 more than what ours is valued at," Sharon Klipp
said. Their 2,300-square-foot home has an estimated value of
$550,000, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever we go out, I tell my agent, 'Don't bother me if that's
all you can show me.' It's all very frustrating," she said, "but what
else can you do about it?"</TE>

<HD>Insurers Place High Premium on Thrills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Medical advances and healthier lifestyles have combined to cut life
insurance rates to near historic lows--but not for the likes of Joe
Humenik.</LD>
<LD>   Humenik, a healthy 48-year-old from Ohio, was paying about $3,500
for a $1-million term-life policy--a rate that is nearly twice what
an average man his age would pay.</LD>
<LD>   The reason: Humenik pilots his own plane. As far as many insurers
are concerned, that makes him a "thrill seeker" qualified only for
high-risk rates.</LD>
<TE>   Daniel Funk, a publishing executive from Santa Monica, has a
similar problem. The 40-year-old father of two likes to rock climb.
He's a careful climber--and probably is healthier for his active
hobbies--but he was paying $800 more for life insurance each year
than someone who is more sedate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the likelihood of getting hit by a truck is a lot greater
than falling off a mountain, when you have been trained and are
specifically trying to make sure that doesn't happen," Funk said. "I
have never been injured while climbing, but there is typically a 50%
to 100% surcharge on any life insurance I want to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Many activities can push a normally "preferred" life insurance
customer into the dreaded realm of the "rated"--those whose premiums
are set individually because they don't fall neatly into a specific
category, life insurance experts say.</TE>
<TE>   There are no statistics showing that scuba divers, mountain
climbers, sky divers or pilots shorten their life spans by engaging
in these activities. But insurers figure they probably do, so they,
and those who smoke the occasional cigar, are thrown out of the
normal life insurance rating pool.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, those who are overweight or who have a serious
ailment in the family--even if the ailment isn't deadly--can find
themselves paying a lot more for life insurance than the average
American, said Mary Maguire, a Chicago-based insurance expert.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to think that there are no bad risks, just some people
who are perceived a little differently," said Chris Greis, president
of Leaders Partners, a wholesale life insurance distribution company
in North Barrington, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, consumers who want to buy life insurance are asked to
fill out a questionnaire. In addition to age and health data, most
insurers specifically ask whether the applicant is a pilot, scuba
diver, mountain climber or "participates in other dangerous
activities."</TE>
<TE>   Say yes, and an agent probably will pry for more information.
People who go rock climbing or bungee jumping once a year are likely
to have little trouble. But someone who routinely participates in
high-risk activities can become largely uninsurable, experts say. And
failing to disclose dangerous hobbies can jeopardize benefits if a
claim is filed.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating Risk</TE>
<TE>   How much can rates rise for the serious thrill seeker? Depending
on the frequency of participation in dangerous activities and on the
insurance company's experience with the issues in question, a healthy
30-year-old can go from paying about 75 cents annually for each
$1,000 in coverage to $5.75 per $1,000, said Greis, who specializes
in high-risk coverage.</TE>
<TE>   (These rates are for term insurance, which is simple insurance
that does not build up a cash value. The cost for cash-value
insurance is substantially higher.)</TE>
<TE>   Why the huge disparity? Insurance works on statistical
probability. With piles of data indicating how many 50-year-olds per
1,000 will die in any given year, insurance companies set premiums
figuring that the vast majority who don't die will pay enough in
premiums to cover the cost of the few who do, plus some for the
insurance company's overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Insurers are great at calculating the risk of death for the
"average" American, whose most dangerous activity is driving to work
while talking on a cell phone, Greis said.</TE>
<TE>   But many companies have little or no experience insuring
individuals who climb rock walls at the local YMCA or go scuba diving
in Australia. Generally speaking, they're reluctant to add too many
thrill seekers to their pool of covered individuals, just in case
those dangerous activities throw their whole statistical analysis off
kilter.</TE>
<TE>   Comparison Shopping</TE>
<TE>   Rates for high-risk activities vary widely among insurers. You
can't even count on getting the lowest rate with companies that
supposedly specialize in a certain type of high-risk consumer,
Humenik said. His high-priced policy was sold by a company that
catered to private pilots. It wasn't until he started comparison
shopping on the Internet that he realized he could get a much better
deal, buying twice as much coverage--a $2-million policy--for the
same $3,500 premium.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were to go to an agent, I would want bids from at least a
half-dozen companies," said David Woods, president of the Life and
Health Insurance Foundation for Education. "Anyone in a high-risk
situation needs to really shop their policy because the rates are all
over the map."</TE>
<TE>   Humenik and Funk also stress that it makes sense to do some
shopping on your own, especially if the rates you've been quoted
appear high. The Internet makes price comparisons simple, Humenik
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get numerous quotes simultaneously. You keep digging and
digging until you find something that you're comfortable with."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Say this much for America's embattled corporate executives: They have
managed to resurrect the public's interest in penny stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Securities regulators fought a hard campaign in the 1990s to turn
people away from the market for penny stocks, a term that generally
refers to shares trading for less than $5. Regulators argued that the
stocks were too risky for most people and were highly vulnerable to
manipulation by crooked traders.</LD>
<LD>   But that was when the boilerplate language used to describe
companies trading on the over-the-counter Bulletin Board and in the
so-called Pink Sheets was that they were "the smallest and most
speculative firms."</LD>
<TE>   These days, only one of those descriptions can be used as a
generalization for companies in those markets. They're still
speculative, for sure. But the Bulletin Board and the Pink Sheets
have become home to such onetime titans as Enron, Global Crossing,
Adelphia Communications and Bethlehem Steel, among others that have
been managed into Bankruptcy Court in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, still listed on the New York Stock Exchange but trading
for less than the price of a bad cup of coffee at some restaurants
are companies such as Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Qwest
Communications.</TE>
<TE>   Many individual investors might well prefer to ignore these
stocks, but they can't--because they've held them straight through
the devastating declines to pocket-change prices. "Buy and hold"
proved to be a very bad concept with far too many tech and telecom
issues.</TE>
<TE>   For other investors, the interest in the new class of penny-priced
shares is less about where they've been than where they may be going,
price-wise.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: The action in shares of WorldCom last week was a
speculator's dream. When the telecom giant's stock resumed trading
Monday after a three-session halt related to its revelation of $3.9
billion in apparent book-cooking, the price dived from 83 cents to 6
cents on record trading volume of 1.5 billion shares.</TE>
<TE>   But after WorldCom Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore on Tuesday
declared that the company is too big and important to fail, some
investors who had been expecting a bankruptcy filing recanted that
view. At 6 cents, or even 10 cents a share, WorldCom appeared too
tantalizing to pass up.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, the price had rebounded to 25 cents a share on Nasdaq,
as trading volume remained massive. For a speculator who was filling
bushel baskets with the stock Monday at 6 cents, the paper gain in
four days was a spectacular 317%.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that bargain-hunting fever infected the broader market
Friday. Key stock indexes soared in the half-day session, with the
Dow Jones industrial average zooming 324.53 points, or 3.6%, to
9,379.50, its highest since June 20.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index and the Nasdaq composite, which
earlier in the week hit their lowest levels in at least 4 1/2 years,
jumped 3.7% and 4.9% Friday, respectively, though both still lost
ground for the week.</TE>
<TE>   What did investors see that suddenly made stocks appealing? The
Fourth of July holiday had passed without a major terrorist attack,
save for the tragedy at Los Angeles International Airport, so the
sheer relief factor was high. Also, many upcoming second-quarter
corporate profit statements are expected to show renewed growth.</TE>
<TE>   But the government's report Friday of June employment trends
showed a smaller-than-expected gain in jobs, suggesting that the
economic recovery is slowing.</TE>
<TE>   It's entirely possible that Friday's market surge had less to do
with the fundamentals than with technical factors. Stocks had been
falling for most of the previous six weeks. In the parlance of market
technicians, Wall Street had become "oversold" and was due for some
kind of bounce.</TE>
<TE>   Many short-term traders are happy to play either side of the
net--a sharp rally in stocks, or a steep decline. They just need
movement to make a quick buck.</TE>
<TE>   But that isn't a prescription for a new, sustained bull market.
For that, Wall Street needs investors who think they can trust
corporate financial data and who don't live in fear that their
favorite CEO has a date with federal prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who have little faith in the long-term prospects of
companies, or in the accuracy of corporate reporting, may figure
there is no material difference between cheesy penny stocks and those
that purport to be blue-chip shares. There certainly hasn't been much
difference in the case of the Lucents, the Qwests and the Enrons.</TE>
<TE>   With that attitude, and with the potential to triple your money in
a penny stock in a week (a la WorldCom) if you get lucky, the allure
of the penny-stock arena may become overpowering for some
individuals. If investing is just gambling anyway, why not gamble for
the big percentage win?</TE>
<TE>   It has happened before: In the early 1980s, the public was
generally uninterested in equities after years of miserable
performance but became fascinated with the penny stocks of fledgling
oil companies amid predictions of $100-a-barrel oil. That penny stock
boom ended badly, as they all do. But for thousands of people, it was
fun, and profitable, while it lasted.</TE>
<TE>   It's a sad commentary, but when was the last time people used the
words "fun" and "profitable" in a sentence involving big-name stock
investing?</TE>

<LD>Messier Ousted as</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal CEO</LD>
<LD>   Jean-Marie Messier was fired as chairman and chief executive of
Vivendi Universal, two years after sweeping in with grand plans to
turn a sleepy French water utility into a global media powerhouse. He
succumbed to a coup engineered by investors and board members after
the company suffered record losses.</LD>
<TE>   Messier's attempt to build a European rival to AOL Time Warner
Inc. failed on both sides of the Atlantic. Amid poor communications
with investors, concerns about the viability of his strategy and the
mounting of massive debt, Vivendi Universal shares plummeted to a
13-year low last month.</TE>
<TE>   But Messier's departure did little to immediately allay investor
concerns. Two rating firms downgraded the company's bonds, which
sparked near-panic selling in Paris, where Vivendi shares plummeted
to a 15-year low last week. Standard &amp; Poor's indicated that
Vivendi's financial obligations this year could be $3 billion more
than analysts had expected, forcing the company to sell assets.</TE>
<TE>   Named to replace Messier was Jean-Rene Fourtou, deputy head of
Franco-German pharmaceutical company Aventis, who immediately vowed
to address concerns about the company's cash needs and to make its
accounting more transparent to shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, speculation swirled over the future of Vivendi's
most influential U.S. executive, Barry Diller, who runs the company's
movie, television and theme-park divisions. Some believe Vivendi may
offer to sell him its Hollywood assets.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Agrees to Buy</TE>
<TE>   TRW for $7.8 Billion</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman Corp. agreed to acquire TRW Inc. for $7.8 billion
in a deal that would create the world's second-largest arms
contractor and heighten competition amid a new era of growth for the
defense industry.</TE>
<TE>   The merger would provide Century City-based Northrop with the
broadest portfolio of products in the defense industry, including
nuclear aircraft carriers, secret eavesdropping satellites,
space-based lasers, unmanned spy planes, Navy destroyers, airborne
radar, battle management software and thousands of electronic
systems.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed acquisition would bring Northrop one step closer to
creating a network of weapons and electronic systems across all three
military services, a feat that is at the crux of the Bush
administration's push to transform the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   The breadth of its businesses would give Northrop elite status
among contractors able to provide "system of systems" integration--a
complex and lucrative task to oversee multibillion-dollar defense
contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The merger also could improve growth prospects for Southern
California's defense industry and result in few if any layoffs,
unlike past defense mergers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jobless Rate Rises; Hiring Figures Revised</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate rose to 5.9% in June and employers
hired fewer than half the number of workers they had been expected
to, the Labor Department said. The figures show the economy
recovering at a maddeningly slow pace.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies added only 36,000 workers last month, substantially
fewer than the 75,000 that had been predicted.</TE>
<TE>   And the government revised previous months' job gains dating to
February, when it was thought that the labor market began to stage a
comeback. The department initially said employers added 66,000 that
month; it now says they trimmed 165,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Auto Sales Strong;</TE>
<TE>   2 Firms Unveil Incentives</TE>
<TE>   Auto sales in the U.S. turned in another strong performance in
June, declining just 1.7% from last year's robust level. Meanwhile,
Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. announced a new round of
sales incentives, which probably will keep sales strong.</TE>
<TE>   The auto sales numbers bode well for the economy as vehicle sales,
a closely watched economic barometer, are a key component of consumer
spending.</TE>
<TE>   GM managed to increase sales 4.3% last month, while Ford continued
its slide, with sales shrinking 10.6% compared with last June.</TE>
<TE>   GM said it is reviving its no-interest financing, offering 0% to
2.9% loans of as long as five years on 2002 model-year vehicles, or
as much as $4,000 cash back. Ford announced it is offering $1,500 to
$3,000 rebates and low-interest loans on 2002 models.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom CEO Says</TE>
<TE>   Firm Is Too Big to Fail</TE>
<TE>   Discounting predictions that WorldCom Inc. might file for
bankruptcy protection, Chief Executive John W. Sidgmore said the
second-biggest U.S. long-distance telephone carrier is too big to
fail.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore, in his most extensive public remarks since WorldCom
disclosed it had uncovered a major accounting fraud, pledged full
cooperation with federal regulators and said the company is working
with its lenders to avoid a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission has accused Clinton,
Miss.-based WorldCom of civil fraud for allegedly hiding $3.9 billion
in expenses. The company, in a report last week, attempted to blame
its bookkeeping lapses on former Chief Financial Officer Scott D.
Sullivan, who, according to WorldCom, was fired in June after the
accounting irregularities were discovered.</TE>
<TE>   The company's report was blasted by the SEC as inadequate, and
Sidgmore vowed to release everything WorldCom learns about the
situation and to "clarify" its explanation of events.</TE>
<TE>   Some of WorldCom's big corporate customers are scrambling to line
up alternative suppliers for systems that transmit company data
internally and to business partners and customers, but analysts
predict that many firms will suffer one way or another from
WorldCom's problems.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   U.S. to Probe Alleged</TE>
<TE>   Shredding at Global</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Ltd. said federal prosecutors in Los Angeles will
investigate allegations that two employees shredded documents at the
Madison, N.J., offices of the fiber-optic network builder after
government investigations began.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing has said documents unrelated to government and
securities fraud lawsuits were destroyed at five of its U.S. and
Canadian offices, but not at its U.S. headquarters. It denied that
any sensitive documents were destroyed at any of its offices.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission, are looking into the Bermuda-based company's accounting
practices as part of investigations of Global Crossing's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, little-known Los Angeles financier Tom T. Gores is
emerging as a strong candidate to buy Global Crossing's core
fiber-optic network business.</TE>
<TE>   Gores' Platinum Equity, a private buyout firm that has picked up
some big chunks of the telecommunications sector, has the cash, the
solid balance sheet and the incentive to grab the bulk of Global
Crossing's business, said people familiar with the bidding process.
Potential buyers are scheduled to turn in offers by Thursday, and the
company can then start negotiations to bring Global Crossing out of
bankruptcy proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart Cancels TV Appearance</TE>
<TE>   Martha Stewart canceled her weekly appearance on CBS' "The Early
Show," saying she does not want to comment further on allegations she
used insider information when selling ImClone Systems Inc. stock.</TE>
<TE>   Other than one formal statement and her CBS appearance late last
month, Stewart has shunned the spotlight since the ImClone
allegations became public.</TE>
<TE>   However, her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., has
hired Brunswick Group, a public-relations strategy firm, apparently
to do damage control. She also has hired high-profile attorney Robert
Morvillo to help her team of lawyers defend her against government
claims that she traded stock on insider information.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has denied wrongdoing.</TE>

<TE>   Housing Project Breaks Ground in Hollywood</TE>
<TE>   Construction began on another high-profile real estate project in
Hollywood, a $125-million shopping center and luxury apartment
complex at one of Los Angeles' best-known intersections.</TE>
<TE>   Named Sunset &amp; Vine, the project is expected to be the largest
multifamily residential development in Hollywood in the last 50
years, according to the builders, Bond Capital Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Bond Capital's financial partners include the California State
Teachers' Retirement System pension fund and former L.A. Laker star

<HD>Victims Vulnerable to Con Artists' Charms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Authorities battling telemarketing fraud not only must contend with
nimble con men but with the self-destructive impulses of many elderly
victims, whose loneliness and yearning for friendship and trust can
make them their own worst enemies.</LD>
<LD>   Some victims are so thoroughly taken in that they have trouble
believing they've been had, even when the evidence is overwhelming.
On occasion, authorities who have tried to save victims with good
advice--or even by returning their checks--have had the surreal
experience of being told to buzz off.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes they go, 'Holy cow, thanks for telling me,' " said Sgt.
Barry R. Baxter of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who heads
Project Emptor, a Vancouver-area task force battling cross-border
fraud. "And sometimes they go, "Thank you, sergeant, for calling me,
but I have a real good feeling about this one.... Please let my money
go through.' "</LD>
<TE>   Baxter recalled the time he was unable to persuade a California
woman to take back $8,500 that had been intercepted by customs
officers on its way to a Vancouver phone fraud ring. Baxter called in
reinforcements--an FBI agent on the task force who finally persuaded
the skeptical victim to take back her check. But Baxter said it would
not surprise him if the money was "turned around and sent right back
up here."</TE>
<TE>   Such episodes partly reflect the persuasive skills of the con men,
who practice being beguilingly friendly and believable in a way that
law enforcement officers never do.</TE>
<TE>   These are "some of the most despicable criminals I have ever run
across," said Mark Beauchamp, a special agent with the U.S. Customs
Service who has investigated cross-border frauds. But "they're
excellent at what they're doing."</TE>
<TE>   For some victims, the telemarketers become emotional stand-ins for
the children who are always too busy, the grandkids they never see.</TE>
<TE>   And the scammers have nothing but time to talk--and to probe for
an emotional connection. If the elderly person is devoutly religious,
the telemarketer just happens to be a big churchgoer, too.</TE>
<TE>   If the victim is ill or grieving the death of a loved one, by
coincidence the telemarketer recently suffered the same kind of loss.</TE>
<TE>   Though it might be assumed that the victims are unsophisticated,
some of them are retired physicians, professors and businesspeople.</TE>
<TE>   If you are losing tens of thousands of dollars to telemarketers,
"you're a person of means, and probably education," said Laureen
France, an investigator with the Federal Trade Commission in Seattle.
People would like "to believe that these [victims] are not us,"
France said. But "this is us in 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates have stepped up efforts to educate the
elderly--imploring them to hang up on telemarketers, and never to
send money to anyone offering money in return.</TE>
<TE>   But Jay Dalton, a San Fernando Valley man whose mother was a
victim, said getting children to keep an eye on their elderly parents
is more important still.</TE>
<TE>   "These cons work because the cons are calling the [victims] more
than the family ... [and are] treating [the victim] with such
kindness on the phone that they build a rapport," Dalton said.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to open the eyes of the victims," he said. "You
have to open the eyes of the families."</TE>

<LD>Re "Voters Oppose Breaking Up Los Angeles," July 2: Of course most
L.A. voters don't want the Valley to secede--all that cash from the
taxpayer base goes away and won't support all those L.A. (non-Valley)
needs. What's wrong with the system is that, even if the 1.4 million
people within the Valley wish to form their own city, they can't if
the 3.7 million people in L.A. don't want them too. That isn't
democracy--only the masses ruling over a body of people who can't
have a voice against them.</LD>
<LD>   An example of how L.A. spends and supports the Valley was outlined
in the same edition, in "L.A. Unified Opens 1st Valley School in 31
Years." With all the overcrowding and extensive growth over the last
31 years, what took so long? Or is it a coincidence that Mayor James
Hahn is suddenly supporting Valley needs to avoid secession?</LD>

<TE>   Why a citywide vote? The whole idea of this secession bid is that
folks in the Valley are seeking to get away from Los Angeles. Don't
the citizens of the San Fernando Valley have the right to determine
their own fate? Where is democracy? This year, around Independence
Day, let's remember that the British were opposed to America's
secession from that empire.</TE>

<TE>   The poll shows that 61% of Hollywood residents are opposed to
secession. As one who lives in a neighborhood that has been drawn
into the map of Hollywood, I sincerely hope that regardless of how
Valley residents and others vote on Valley secession they will
respect the stated wishes of the people in Hollywood by opposing the
secession of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   As a historical note, those who say that Hollywood has been
neglected by the city of Los Angeles are wrong. As far back as 1983,
the city took note of the decline of Hollywood and began the process
to declare it a Community Redevelopment Agency zone that would allow
city money to be set aside for redevelopment and revitalization. A
group of Hollywood citizens filed suit to prevent this from
happening. City money was held up for years while the suit made its
way to the state Supreme Court, where it met final defeat in 1991.
Finally money was released, and we are beginning to see the benefits.</TE>

<TE>   Neighborhood councils in their current form have little chance for
citywide success ("An Era of Neighborhoods," editorial, June 30).
Unlike the new local area planning commissions, which have created
devolution in central control of localized planning concerns,
neighborhood councils are strictly "advisory" by statute, and the
imprimatur of city certification will not garner them any true
representation within the current structure of city governance. The
one opportunity for limited authority was the promise of an annual
city budget expenditure allowing each certified council to spend
discretionary funds in its community. This has now been replaced by
the requirement to apply for specific grant money.</TE>
<TE>   I do agree that neighborhood councils would thrive as part of a
borough system. All current borough proposals are united by the
inclusion of neighborhood councils, albeit with some form of
authority or budget allocation.</TE>

<LD>Re "Peace Missions Are Put in Doubt," July 3: I am utterly astounded
at the scofflaw attitude of the United States government toward the
new International Criminal Court, to the point of its willingness to
sabotage U.N. peacekeeping missions all over the world and plunge
entire countries like Bosnia and East Timor back into the abyss of
civil war just because our government wants to secure for Americans
absolute immunity from any court prosecutions.</LD>
<LD>   America is now ruled by an outlaw government that simply tears up
any treaties it no longer wants to live by; asserts the right to
first-strike use of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world for any
purpose, while denying that right to other nations; and now insists
that our military and civilian personnel are completely above the law
anywhere they go in the world. All the policies I've mentioned have
wide "bipartisan" support from the U.S. foreign policy establishment.</LD>
<LD>   Reading your July 1 and 3 articles on the U.S.' defiance of
international law and justice in regard to the International Criminal
Court and the peacekeeping responsibilities of the world's remaining
superpower, I feel profoundly embarrassed to be an American.</LD>

<TE>   I don't agree with this president or his bonehead advisors about
our role in the United Nations and in peacekeeping missions
throughout the world. Who are these guys who say that the U.S. should
be exempt from rules that everyone else has to follow? What a great
way to lose the friends we have and increase the hatred of our
enemies.</TE>
<TE>   These selfish idiots are like the bullies my son comes in contact
with--those playground boys who set rules for all the other kids to
follow but get to break the rules themselves. Proves we need a lot
more women in government, so some mom can give 'em the evil mom-eye,

legacy in history as the man who started World War III.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"INS Covers More Ground Than Homeland Security" (Commentary, July 1)
argues that placing the Immigration and Naturalization Service under
a new Department of Homeland Security would "deflect the agency from
its core missions." The problem, however, is that no one can really
define what the INS' core mission is, which is the primary reason the
agency has been a bureaucratic basket case for decades.</LD>
<LD>   Ironically, placing it under Homeland Security would give the INS
the very thing it has lacked for a long time: a definable
national-interest mission. That, along with some competent
management, would be needed even if there weren't a serious threat to
national security.</LD>
<LD>   Homeland Security is exactly where the INS belongs. Just as every
innocent airline passenger is subject to rigorous scrutiny before
boarding a flight, all applicants to come to the United States need
to be examined to ensure that they do not pose a threat to our
society. We cannot ignore the reality of the world in which we live
today.</LD>

<LD>Every person who has criticized airport security and security
screeners since Sept. 11 should applaud the dedication and the
observation skills that resulted in the grounding of an airline
piloted by two intoxicated pilots ("Pilots Drunk at Jetliner's Helm,
Police Say," July 2). In this time of war and worry about homeland
security it is easy to lay blame on our airport security forces.
These first-line defense forces have a difficult job, are paid low
wages, are met with hostility by passengers and are required to
fulfill a job that can only be as good as the equipment they use and
how much training they receive.</LD>
<LD>   Obviously the security screeners on duty did their job because
they cared. Next time you stand in line for a security check, thank
the security people for their time. They are there to save lives and
they know it.</LD>

<LD>Re "Tackling Neighborhoods' Little Woes Before They Grow Large," June
28:</LD>
<LD>   My neighbors and I recently had an ongoing parking problem in the
alley behind our houses. After months of frustration on our part and
inaction on the city's part, I wrote letters to the Parking
Violations Bureau, Mayor James Hahn, City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter
and City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo.</LD>
<LD>   I received a form letter from Parking Violations. Hahn's and
Galanter's offices never even bothered to respond to my plea for
help. But within three days, Gita Isagholian, the "neighborhood
prosecutor" from the city attorney's office, called me. Within two
weeks, she and Theresa Skinner, the senior lead officer for the
Police Department's Pacific Division, had solved our problem.</LD>
<TE>   Not only was I thrilled to get the issue resolved, I was elated
that someone in city government actually responded to my plea and
took on the responsibility of fixing the problem. Delgadillo should
be commended for instituting such an innovative and effective
program.</TE>

1:</LD>
<LD>   Frida Ghitis writes it is a "grand irony" that President Bush
conditions a Palestinian state on the creation of a free and tolerant
democracy, because no such Arab state currently exists and
Palestinians already have more religious and political freedom than
our friends the Saudis and Egyptians.</LD>
<LD>   But it is precisely their relative political sophistication that
makes the Palestinians the best people to start with. Moreover,
insistence on a genuine Arab democracy, committed to peace, could
lead to fundamental change in the Middle East.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, American acquiescence in the creation of still
another Arab tyranny, born out of terror, would benefit no one.</TE>

<TE>   In your June 30 Opinion review of world media reactions to
President Bush's Middle East speech ("World to Bush: Get Real!"), you
quote Ali Abunimah of Ramallah Online as referring to the
Palestinians as being "dispossessed of their country and freedom for
54 years."</TE>
<TE>   Comments like this show that there are Palestinians who feel that
for them, the problem is not "occupation" in the West Bank but rather
the very existence of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   People are in denial if they do not see that many Palestinians
want to go back 54 years and wipe the state of Israel off the map,
just as Palestinian textbooks and maps already do.</TE>

responses to the terror deliberately and systematically provoked by
Sharon because he abhors peaceful solutions.</TE>

<HD>Had Your McYoga Today? A Stretch of Success</HD>
<DH>Bikram Choudhury looks to franchise his torrid technique</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY E. MacGREGOR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dressed in sky-blue polyester, Bikram Choudhury leans back in his
leather chair and holds forth on how he saved Hollywood, how he saved
America, and how he will save the world. With yoga.</LD>
<LD>   His yoga.</LD>
<LD>   It is from here--a nondescript warehouse on La Cienega Boulevard
north of the Santa Monica Freeway--that this spiritually driven,
trash-talking, Rolls-Royce-driving guru is building his vast yoga
empire.</LD>
<TE>   Next to him is a map of the world, with pins for every Bikram yoga
studio in America. In 1973 there would have been three pins--one in
Honolulu, one in San Francisco and one in Beverly Hills. In January
there were 500. Today, 650 pins stud the map. Bikram studios, he
says, are opening around the world at a rate of two a day. Some
cities--such as San Francisco--are so saturated with Bikram yoga
studios that Choudhury may put a moratorium on the area.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like this for years," Choudhury says, drawing a flat line
through the air. "Then in the last years it shot up, like this! Like
a rocket!" He launched his hand skyward and nearly leaps out of his
chair.</TE>
<TE>   Choudhury has taught his trademark brand of sweaty yoga--practiced
in 100-plus-degree heat-- in Beverly Hills for nearly three decades.
He has always done well. But now, he is riding the crest of the yoga
tsunami sweeping the nation, and he is poised to cash in on his
"product" the American way. Since January, a San Diego lawyer has
copyrighted and trademarked Bikram's name, products, logo, clothing
line, his scripted 90-minute teaching dialogue, and his sequence of
26 asanas, or postures.</TE>
<TE>   Choudhury is not the first to copyright or trademark yoga
products. But by fall, if all goes as planned, Bikram's Yoga College
of India will become what is believed to be the first yoga franchise
in the United States. The announcement has caused a stir in the yoga
world, where Choudhury is already a controversial figure, dubbed
"yoga's bad boy" by Yoga Journal.</TE>
<TE>   By franchising, Choudhury makes tangible uncomfortable links
between spirituality and commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't typically think of yoga and business being that
intertwined," said Michael Harris, who runs a Bikram yoga studio in
Portland, Ore.. "But yoga and business country have become
intertwined."</TE>
<TE>   Trisha Lamb Feuerstein of the Yoga Research and Education Center,
a Santa Rosa-based nonprofit that tracks yoga trends, said
franchising defies the spirit of yoga. "Yoga is huge and infinite.
What's being branded are the physical aspects of the practice. You
can't brand the spiritual aspects. Yoga is not hamburgers."</TE>
<TE>   Choudhury counters that his popularity has created copycats and
diluted his teachings. Franchising, he hopes, will keep his yoga pure
and his workout as reliable as a cup of Starbucks coffee.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people think yoga belongs to the world," said Choudhury's
attorney, Jacob Reinbolt of San Diego."That is wrong." Bikram's
unique method, he says, "is one of the most easily protectable pieces
of intellectual property there is."</TE>
<TE>   So will Bikram yoga be as standardized as McDonald's?</TE>
<TE>   For a moment the charismatic yoga-vangelist who preaches the
miracles of the discipline in an amped-up patter of Indian-accented
hyperbole until he is hoarse, grows reflective.</TE>
<TE>   "You could say that," he finally says. "Only I sell life."</TE>
<TE>   In 21st century America, yoga is big business. There are yoga
retreats, yoga weekends, yoga books, yoga clothing lines, yoga
calendars, yoga videos, baby yoga, even a yoga cruise.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how many millions of Americans are practicing yoga,
but a 1998 survey by the Wall Street Journal and NBC pegged the
number at more than 18 million (up from 6 million in 1994). Although
there are no current figures, the editor of Yoga Journal believes the
number is significantly higher.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere is yoga more popular than in America's largest and most
stressed-out urban centers. But with perhaps more brand-name yoga
gurus per capita than any other city in the country--and legions of
celebrities doing "downward dog" daily--Los Angeles has emerged as a
center for yoga innovation. Still, for critics, franchising a form of
the 5,000-year-old sacred path to divine realization seems like the
biggest, and crudest, step yet in the commodification of spirituality
in America.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never heard of this," said Deborah Willoughby, founding
editor of Yoga International, a Pennsylvania-based magazine that
focuses on the spiritual dimensions of yoga. "A lot of places have
branch centers, like Shivananda, or the Himalayan Institute, where
students will open a center and work under the guidance of a
spiritual director. But it is not like it is owned, or licensed. It
is just a desire to spread the spiritual teachings.</TE>
<TE>   Franchising, she said, is "hard to imagine."</TE>
<TE>   "But it's very California," she said. "I think it probably means
everyone else will be doing it soon."</TE>
<TE>   On Easter Sunday, 300 giddy wannabes have descended on Bikram's
Yoga College of India on La Cienega for an intense, nine-week boot
camp that will transform them into yoga teachers. They have come from
France and Hungary, from Vancouver and Denver, from San Diego and
Silver Lake. They have paid $5,000 each for the chance to study at
the feet of the Indian master.</TE>
<TE>   Choudhury offered his first teacher training course eight years
ago, to 35 students. Today his courses fill as soon as they are
offered. This is his largest class ever. Choudhury earns $3 million
annually in teacher training alone.</TE>
<TE>   The training program is the key to Choudhury's breakneck
expansion; these fresh arrivals are the foot soldiers of the empire.
They will practice yoga twice a day, drill each posture until they
get it right and listen to lectures until the wee hours.</TE>
<TE>   They will also have to memorize every word of "the dialogue"
verbatim, complete with Bikram similes and turns of phrase. After the
course ends, they will be dispatched to their hometowns like
missionaries--taking Bikram to the people.</TE>
<TE>   Bikram Choudhury, 56, was born in Calcutta, where yoga is a way of
life. Like many Indians, he began doing yoga at the age of 4. His
guru, or teacher, was Bishnu Ghosh, brother of Paramahasa Yogananda,
who founded the Self-Realization Fellowship. At 13, Choudhury won the
National India Yoga Contest--which judges suppleness and strength,
knowledge, and presentation--and remained its undefeated champion for
three years. Choudhury then became a weightlifter, winning the All
India Weight Lifting Competition in 1963 at age 16. A year later he
dropped a 380-pound barbell on his knee. He says doctors told him he
would never walk again. He turned to his teacher--and yoga. Six
months later, he says, his knee was healed.</TE>
<TE>   Bikram's yoga is made up of a sequence of 26 postures (each of
which is performed twice), and two breathing exercises, culled from
84 classical postures and more than 10,000 combinations. He heats the
room to between 100 and 105 degrees, he says, to work bodies like a
blacksmith.</TE>
<TE>   At the urging of his guru, Choudhury came to the West. He opened
his first studio in Los Angeles in Beverly Hills in 1973, in the
basement of a former bank building. He was young and gorgeous, at a
time when the nation was bewitched with all things Indian--from
bedspreads and incense to Ravi Shankar and Krishnamurti.</TE>
<TE>   "In those years he was trying to be a pure yogi," recalls Emmy
Cleaves, who was Bikram's 15th student in Los Angeles and is now a
senior teacher. "He slept on the floor there. That's the kind of
sacrifice he was willing to make. He has invested a lot in this,
because his guru told him to go out and teach yoga. From an Indian
perspective, he was doing the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   In those days Choudhury was celibate. He didn't drink, nor does he
now. Some recall that the young Choudhury was so shy he would barely
meet people's eyes when he spoke. He ran his yoga school as if it
were in Calcutta, rather than Beverly Hills. "Do you know, every yoga
school in India is free?" Bikram asked. "My school was free. We don't
think to charge money. For us, a yoga school is like a temple. I had
a little box, and people could put money in it. Like a church."</TE>
<TE>   Shirley MacLaine, one of his earliest students, took him aside.
"You cannot run a yoga school the Indian way," he says she told him.
She hired a manager and a security guard, he says, and he began to
charge for classes.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's free, only 15 people would come," Choudhury said. "That's
the way America is." (A 90-minute class at Bikram's Yoga College of
India costs $20, making it one of the most expensive in the city.)</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, by arrangement of his guru's son, Choudhury wed
Rajashree, a famed yogini--or yoga practitioner-- and five-time All
India Yoga Champion. "That was the main reason I married her," he
says. "She beat all the men, 1,400 people. The year we got married
she was the champion."</TE>
<TE>   They have a daughter, Laju, 12, and a son, Anurag, 9. Rajashree
has proved a strong businesswoman and a gentle presence against
Choudhury's braggadocio.</TE>
<TE>   On this, their first day of orientation, the students shed their
shoes and walk into the 10,000-square-foot room where they will spend
more than 12 hours a day for the next two months. This is no ashram,
with wafting incense, soft light and chanting in the background. This
is a yoga factory.</TE>
<TE>   Mirrors line the walls. A carpet stretches forever. Lines for yoga
mats are etched like parking places on the floor. Students trim their
mats so everyone can fit in. Fluorescent lights glare down from
above. The light, the mirrors, the microphones, give the room a
carnival-esque quality. During yoga classes, heaters blow so hot,
people grow lightheaded. The stench of sweating bodies hits a visitor
like a wall.</TE>
<TE>   On the second day, around noon, Choudhury finally arrives. (The
master does not rise early because he stays up late watching Hindi
movies.) Applause ripples through the room as he walks across the
carpet, touching the hands of students who reach for him like a rock
star.</TE>
<TE>   Choudhury defies the stereotype of a soul-soothing,
aphorism-spewing bearded yogi. He likes expensive cars and Rolex
watches. He likes to drop the names of famous people he claims to
have saved (MacLaine, Raquel Welch, Quincy Jones), the athletes whose
careers he claims to have has resurrected (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, John
McEnroe), the president he says he cured (Richard Nixon--of
phlebitis).</TE>
<TE>   He climbs onto a chair perched like a throne on a large mirrored
cube, and dons a headset. His introduction ranges from the
compassionate to the profane, from the incomprehensible to the
profound. Now, he is a soulful Indian. Now, an abuse-spewing
Hollywood executive. (Cleaves calls his tendency to swear and
exaggerate "Bikram-isms.") "Sometimes he uses a little profanity. He
never did that in the early years," she says. "He learned a lot of
that from the show-biz people. He thought that was America."</TE>
<TE>   He welcomes his students and warns them what lies ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, they say, you can take a horse to the pond, but you
can't make him drink," he says. "My way is different. I only take the
horse to the pond to make him drink. If he doesn't, I'll cut his head
off."</TE>
<TE>   He asks the students to introduce themselves.</TE>
<TE>   A man rises.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from San Diego. I've been doing yoga for 11 months. I love
Bikram. He is God."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the students hope to open studios, some want to teach.
Some just love the yoga.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Colgan, 38, was a Northern California software executive who
quit his job to study with Bikram. "He is a world-class evangelist,"
Colgan said. "And I've known a lot of them in the technology world."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Besleme, 30, took up yoga to help her overcome running
injuries. Just out of graduate school, she has been hired by the Bush
White House to help develop environmental policy. She waffled about
disclosing to her new bosses the yoga training, fearing she would be
labeled a flake. She said she hopes to bring Bikram Yoga to the White
House. Seriously. "Why not bring this gift of healing to the people
who are making this country function and run?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   On the 61st day of training, just two days before graduation,
teacher training is winding down. Choudhury will lecture on the
postures. Normally, he teaches his yoga classes in a tiny Speedo and
lectures in street clothes. But tonight he is in tight white shorts
decorated with red and orange flames.  He climbs on the mirrored box
and dances, as his students cheer. In his day, they say Choudhury
ruled the discos. He still loves to dance.</TE>
<TE>   Here, there are no typical Indian greetings of "namaste." No oms.
"Welcome to Bikram's Torture Chamber," he announces, and he is not
joking.</TE>
<TE>   "This is beyond human imagination," Bikram says of his yoga. "You
are not Kareem, McEnroe, or Nixon. You are just a piece of
[expletive]." He threatens, in street language, to do damage.</TE>
<TE>   He segues into a discussion of the postures but digresses again.
"Your country, your life, they are a joke," he says. "This country is
a mental hospital. It is never too late. You are never too old. You
will be cured by only doing one thing," he says. "What is that?'"</TE>
<TE>   "Yoga," they cry out.</TE>
<TE>   What?</TE>
<TE>   "Yoga!"</TE>
<TE>   Students having trouble with postures come to the front of the
room to be corrected. A 50-ish man comes to the front of the room and
sits. Should he push himself in a posture that really hurts his knee?
He tries to lean back. Students stand, craning to see if he will make
it, holding their breath. Will he hurt himself?</TE>
<TE>   Bikram stands over him like a Marine drill sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it hurts! What do you think this is, cheesecake? When I
crushed my knee, I used to bite my finger [in pain]. I had 10 bloody
fingers. If you die, call me. American men are like women.</TE>
<TE>   "What do I sell?" Choudhury asks as the man struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "Pain," they scream.</TE>
<TE>   Later, a woman comes up and does a beautiful "camel." She leans
back on her knees and grabs her feet. She arches beautifully. Bikram
climbs onto her, his feet on her hip bones, surfing her like a circus
acrobat.</TE>
<TE>   And then, Choudhury will stun with his compassion. A stiff guy
comes up to do the camel. He kneels. Choudhury instantly perceives an
old ankle injury and grows gentle.</TE>
<TE>   His ability to discern injury and illness is uncanny, say his
students. From afar, he can spot a twisted spine, an injured knee, a
weak shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if the guru has lost his way in America. Those who
know Choudhury say beneath the trappings of wealth and glamour, he is
still a man committed to protecting his special form of yoga, and--as
his guru ordered--to spreading it as far as possible whatever it
takes.</TE>
<TE>   "Being in L.A., having all his cars, having all those people
around him, has changed him," said Tony Sanchez, a yogi in San
Francisco who studied with Choudhury and has a copyrighted yoga
system of his own. "Underneath all that, though, I think he is a very
pure, a very simple, and a very beautiful person."</TE>
<TE>   Choudhury wearies of hearing that his brand of yoga is somehow not
spiritual enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I teach spirituality," he said. "I use the body as a medium. I
use the body to control your mind, to make your spirit happy."</TE>
<TE>   But before he can expand on the thought, his inner salesman
emerges, touting ambitious new projects that seem to sprout from his
head by the minute. He is building five new studios in L.A., have you
heard? He is expanding the La Cienega studio. He is making an
infomercial that will reach millions. He is working with partners to
build a "health city" in India.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, he was on the phone from Paris.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just at the opening of a studio here today," he said. "This
is unbelievable. This has become a multimillion-dollar corporation.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I tell you about the first world yoga contest in Los Angeles,
from Sept. 25 to 28? There will be judges from all over the
world...."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From the moment they arrive, the class of 300 future yoga teachers is
told why the franchising of Bikram Choudhury's special brand of yoga
will be good for them. Details are still being hashed out, but future
Bikram teachers will probably pay an initial franchising fee of
several hundred dollars and a small percentage of each month's
profits.</LD>
<LD>   "There are people mixing Bikram yoga with God knows what," said
Sara Powers, Choudhury's general manager, in a lecture to the
students about franchising. "They take his yoga, throw in shoulder
stands [a yoga position], light some incense, put on some music and
call it Bikram yoga. You can't do that."</LD>
<LD>   Bikram, she said, is not franchising so he can buy another
Rolls-Royce. "Franchising will make Bikram yoga a more valuable
commodity," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Among potential franchisees, reaction is mixed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure a lot of people are like eeeewwww, franchise, it's like
McDonald's," said Kate Besleme, a Bikram student from Washington,
D.C., who just graduated from business school.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think it is a brilliant idea. It's not only smart business,
but it's good for the people who take classes, because it provides
consistency."</TE>
<TE>   Bill and Sandy McCauley and five of their children run a chain of
yoga studios called Yoga Loka in Northern California. They offer
Bikram yoga, as well as several other types. In mid-June, they
received a letter from Choudhury's attorney telling them they would
risk being sued if they did not either adhere to the rigid rules of
the proposed  franchise or stop teaching Bikram yoga.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going through tremendous turmoil," said Bill McCauley. "We
don't want to be involved because it gives Bikram too much control
over us." McCauley is especially conflicted because he believes
Bikram's system of yoga is the best. The McCauleys say they have seen
students with scoliosis straighten their spines, students with
diabetes cut their insulin intake in half, and some with spinal
injuries become pain-free, all as a result of the Bikram method.</TE>
<TE>   "He has put together the finest series of yoga that has ever been
created," said McCauley, "but the way he is trying to do this is like
Hitler taking over Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Sandy McCauley also has misgivings. "Yoga is something that can't
be owned by someone," she said. "I think that if you practice and
teach yoga regularly, you start to awaken. You need to be free to act
on those inspirations and not be under someone's thumb. I respect and
admire what Bikram has brought to the world, in terms of a great
system that has popularized yoga. Beyond that, I need to be free."</TE>

<HD>Really Best Friends Forever</HD>
<DH>The ties of a dozen women stretch across six decades to
their West Adams girlhood</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Friendship and longevity are simply not the kinds of things one can
know about in the beginning. Certainly the Dreamers had no idea back
when they were kids that now, at age 75, they would still be
together, still be best friends. Still be a dozen strong.</LD>
<LD>   Time is a powerful test. And 12 is a big number.</LD>
<LD>   For six decades, since their high school days--and for some,
dating all the way back to grade school--the women have been fast
friends.</LD>
<TE>   And they have the memories to prove it: Remember when you scraped
your knee on the pedals of my bike? When you copied my essay word for
word and got a better grade than I did? When we sneaked into the
Hollywood Bowl on a double date?</TE>
<TE>   To say nothing of the time the whole group went skinny-dipping at
age 60.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley, Esther, Hannah and Betty have known each other since
1933, when they were in the first grade together at Virginia Road
Elementary School in the West Adams District of Los Angeles. At Mount
Vernon Junior High, they met Phyllis, Gloria, Frances, Billie and
Marie. Evelyn, freshly transplanted to Los Angeles from New York, was
in the same 10th-grade French class as Shirley. Ruth, Millie and
Janet entered the fold in high school too.</TE>
<TE>   When the girls were seniors, they formed a girlfriends club, with
officers and regular meetings, and called themselves the Dreamers.
The group has shifted slightly over the years--one early Dreamer has
fallen out of touch, another woman has been an occasional adjunct
member, and one member has died--but 12 are still together, still
helping each other through all that life dishes out.</TE>
<TE>   Even through the most hectic times of their lives, the group has
managed to get together nearly every year. At their most recent
reunion, to celebrate hitting the 75 mark, almost everyone made it to
a seaside resort in Del Mar for a three-day gabfest and story swap.</TE>
<TE>   They say they haven't changed much since their school days, and
when they are all together, joking and laughing and reliving the old
memories, it doesn't take much of an imagination to see them as their
younger selves. "We were all children together, and around each
other, we're still children," says Phyllis Kurtz Rabins.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the girls grew up in West Adams, then a predominantly
Jewish neighborhood, and most attended Dorsey High. Their parents
were mostly immigrants from Eastern Europe, and it was natural that
their best friends would come from the same neighborhoods and schools
and backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   "First we were Californians and people, but we understood that we
were also Jewish girls," Shirley Lazarus Steppler says. As they were
growing up, World War II was being fought. They wrote letters to
soldiers and sailors but also played tennis, went horseback riding
and spent lazy days at the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Going steady" with a boy meant dates at a hamburger joint called
the Witch Stand, jitterbugging together to live big bands, and
parking on Mulholland Drive for long make-out sessions. "We kissed
like crazy, but that's as far as we got. There was no sex. We didn't
sleep together. It was a question of whether you got married, or it
was over," Betty Fisher Weiner says.</TE>
<TE>   The girls didn't have hokey bonding rituals--no secret handshakes,
no oaths sworn in blood, no chants, none of the stuff from the "Ya-Ya
Sisterhood"--but they did formalize their friendship by creating the
Dreamers.</TE>
<TE>   New members had to be approved by unanimous vote of the current
members. "I would invite someone over to a meeting, and everyone had
to approve. It was highly selective," says Steppler, who is club
historian.</TE>
<TE>   It was common in those days for girls to organize their own social
clubs, Steppler says. She got the idea for the club from her older
sister, who was in a club. (Her sister's club, a group of six women
in their late 70s, still meets.)</TE>
<TE>   The Dreamers shared more than lipsticks, suntan oil and the latest
gossip--they shared boyfriends too. "Maybe I'd go with Malcolm and
then Shirley went with Malcolm. And this one went with Morty and then
I went with Morty ... and there were no hard feelings! We were not
jealous of each other," Fisher Weiner says.</TE>
<TE>   Really? No hard feelings? The query is met with a chorus of
indignant no's. "We were glad to get rid of them!" Hannah Handman
Hamovitch declares.</TE>
<TE>   After high school, some of the girls went to college; others
worked for a few years before getting married.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the fantasy of that period was really not having a career
for most of us. It certainly was not my fantasy. We wanted to get
married and live happily ever after and have children," Steppler
says.</TE>
<TE>   All the Dreamers did marry and have children. Most stayed in the
Los Angeles area--Fisher Weiner lived for a time in New Jersey but
eventually moved back. One Dreamer lives in Northern California, but
the rest settled in Southern California communities, from Beverly
Hills to Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of those who lived so close to each other became closer. But
for a lot of years, if you asked me who are your friends, it would
still be these girls," says Esther Rosenblatt Spector, who moved to
what seemed a distant San Pedro after her marriage in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   Once their children were grown, the women embarked on a variety of
careers: Spector was a school secretary; Evelyn Herman Dreyfuss
became an activist on behalf of Soviet Jews; Steppler studied art
history and worked in child care; Marie Sussman Weiner worked at a
boutique; Ruth Weinstein Bieber was a dental hygienist and a
distributor for Shaklee products; Millie Sturner Eilenberg worked at
a dental office; Gloria Kornberg Kahn became a substitute high school
teacher and volunteered at the L.A. Zoo; Rabins volunteered at a
hospital and worked as a bookkeeper; Fisher Weiner became an activist
for Jewish causes; Hamovitch worked at a social service agency.</TE>
<TE>   Today they are busy with grandchildren, volunteering, and hobbies
such writing, painting and gardening.</TE>
<TE>   Two Dreamers, Janet Feldmar Rose and Billie Weinberg Mendelson,
couldn't make it to the most recent reunion. Eilenberg's Parkinson's
disease and other ailments almost kept her away. "I didn't want to
travel ... but I'm glad I came. It didn't hurt me in any way. My
younger son made me. He told me that in order to get well, you've got
to work at it," Eilenberg says.</TE>
<TE>   The women say they feel extraordinarily blessed to have a group of
friends who have known each other since childhood and who know they
can lean on each other in times of need. "Hannah is very wonderful
for me right now," Fisher Weiner says, tearing up as she looks at
Hamovitch. Fisher Weiner was widowed in 1994, and Hamovitch, twice
widowed, has helped her through a difficult time.</TE>
<TE>   Since they all knew one another's parents, their friendship also
helps keep the memory of their parents alive, the women say.</TE>
<TE>   And the memory of Frances Orenstein Koch, the Dreamer who died of
cancer about four years ago, is still strong. "We were young
together, we got our periods together, we slept over each other's
houses. We miss her, and she's not here. If she were here ... she'd
be the one telling us what to do," Fisher Weiner says.</TE>
<TE>   "She added her own personality. It's like a bouquet--when you take
something out, something's missing," Hamovitch adds.</TE>
<TE>   The women say their children, who grew up in a more frenetic, more
impersonal world, have not found the same breadth and depth of
friendships in their own lives.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids are amazed. They have friends here and there but not a
group that's been together years and years and years. I feel sad for
my kids that they don't have the friendships we had," Spector says.</TE>
<TE>   There is another generation on its way, though. Fisher Weiner's
and Dreyfuss' granddaughters, ages 2 and 3, play together regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher Weiner says she and Dreyfuss try to ingrain in the little
girls the importance of female friendship. "We tell our 3-year-olds,
you've got to make girlfriends. It's important to make girlfriends,"
Fisher Weiner says.</TE>
<TE>   And a dozen of them is a good number.</TE>

<LD>"Winnie-the-Pooh"</LD>
<LD>   by A.A. Milne</LD>
<LD>   "Winnie-the-Pooh" is a great book about a silly old bear called
Pooh. He and his friends Piglet, Rabbit, Owl, Kanga, little Roo and
Eeyore have great adventures. For instance, they once went out to
catch a Heffalump, which is an imaginary creature like an elephant.</LD>
<TE>   I would recommend this book because it is a great adventure story.</TE>

<TE>   "Hooway for Wodney Wat"</TE>
<TE>   by Helen Lester</TE>
<TE>   A rat named Wodney could not pronounce his "Rs." He said "w"
instead of "r." The other rats made fun of him because of the way he
said his words. Read the story to find out how Wodney learned his
sounds.</TE>
<TE>   We recommend this book. It has great pictures. We think it is very
funny and we learned that it is not nice to make fun of people
because of how they speak.</TE>

<TE>   "Over and Over"</TE>
<TE>   by Charlotte Zolotow</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a little girl who doesn't know about time. She
wants to find out what comes next. All the holidays happen and then
she has a birthday. She makes a wish. She wishes that it would all
happen over and over.</TE>

<TE>   by Marc Tolon Brown</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was playing soccer at the Lakewood School. The Brain told
Francine to pass the ball to him, but Francine didn't. She passed it
to Arthur. Then the Brain and Francine got into a fight. Buster and
Arthur tried their best to make them friends again. Read the book to
find out if Francine and the Brain become friends.</TE>

<TE>   "Princess Bella and the Red Velvet Hat"</TE>
<TE>   by T. Davis Bunn</TE>
<TE>   Princess Bella had 79 hats, but she wore only one. It was bright
red velvet and much too big. She wore the hat to hide her face. She
thought she was ugly. Her father, the king, helped her believe that
beauty comes from within you.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For months, we had anticipated their visit: a fun-filled week at home
with my two nephews from Northern California--one 4 years old, the
other 7 months--while my brother and his wife took a short
anniversary trip.</LD>
<LD>   My girls dreamed of taking the baby for walks and carting him
around to show off to their friends. They planned to teach the
4-year-old to swim, to play soccer, to ride a bike. We'd have family
outings--five kids and me--to the beach, the zoo and Chuck E.
Cheese's.</LD>
<LD>   But the rigors of outings with car seats and stroller and diaper
bag made our trips few and far between. The baby was happiest at
home, crawling around the living room floor, stuffing bits of paper
in his mouth and trying to aggravate the dogs. And his brother wanted
to play baseball, not soccer, pronounced pool water "too tickly" to
swim in, and preferred California Pizza Kitchen to Chuck E. Cheese's.</LD>
<TE>   "He doesn't want to do anything we want to do," my 11-year-old
complained, as he led her outside by the hand for another round of
baseball on our front lawn. "He can't have everything his way!"</TE>
<TE>   On his visit last summer when he was 3, he had run behind her and
her older sisters wherever they went, delighting in his cousins'
antics, following their dictates gleefully. Now, at 4, he
purposefully dawdles, greets every request with a question ("Why?"),
and devotes his boundless energy to fashioning his own identity.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just like you girls at that age," I tell her, recalling the
hours I'd spent playing Barbies, watching cartwheels, pushing
4-year-olds on swings. Now, as reality clashed with their fantasies,
my daughters felt that sense of responsibility. And I, from the
perspective of indulgent aunt, could enjoy the luxury of memories.</TE>
<TE>   The work seemed more tedious. I was impatient as I scrubbed juice
stains from the carpet, collected dirty socks and sippy cups and
teething rings, plucked plastic dinosaurs from the pile of trash on
the kitchen floor.</TE>
<TE>   But I am more tolerant. I can enjoy these kids in ways I couldn't
enjoy my own. I don't invest each moment with such significance that
I live in fear of doing something wrong. It's not just that they're
not mine to mold, but that I realize now how resilient children are.
So it doesn't bother me all that much when the baby fusses. I know
he's tired of sitting, but he can wait to be picked up until I finish
making his brother's lunch. He'll sleep better once he's exercised
his lungs. And he won't remember this when he's grown.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, I am not embarrassed by the idiosyncrasies of a
4-year-old. When he picks clothes that don't match, asks me to polish
his nails, refuses to join neighbor kids in a game, insists on
wearing his hair plastered to his head with gobs of gel ... that's
not a commentary on my management, just a 4-year-old being 4.</TE>
<TE>   And if my new attitude frees him, it liberates me as well. I don't
feel compelled to answer every "Why?" with some sort of rational
explanation, when "because I said so" fits the bill.</TE>
<TE>   I was supposed to keep them on a schedule, follow the rules,
adhere to routines. The 4-year-old "needs to go to bed by 8:30," my
brother advised. "He gets up at 7 and if he doesn't get enough sleep,
he'll get cranky." He needs a bedtime story to fall asleep, and the
baby should be rocked before he's put down.</TE>
<TE>   The list of warnings, needs and requirements seemed endless ... as
did the patient explanations. Didn't they remember I'd done this
three times over?</TE>
<TE>   I felt insulted ... and then sheepish, thinking back to when I was
in my brother's shoes. I realized how overbearing I was the first
time I left my girls with relatives. Their dad and I had taken them
to Ohio, then left them with his folks and took a weekend trip. And I
left my mother-in-law a list of instructions--three lists, actually,
typewritten, one for each girl--detailing everything from how often
they needed to go to the bathroom to what they should eat for
breakfast. I recall my mother-in-law rolling her eyes as she put the
lists aside. "We'll do fine, won't we, girls?" she said. And as we
drove away, I cried.</TE>
<TE>   What my children remember from those visits has nothing to do with
routines I prescribed. Their grandma's house was always noisy and
full of kids. They learned to shoot pool and catch lightning bugs,
stayed up past midnight watching movies, had biscuits with honey for
breakfast in Grandma's bed. "And she didn't even care about the
crumbs," they still marvel.</TE>
<TE>   It was me tossing out routines this time around. I hope the kids
don't tell, but I let the baby have pancakes for breakfast and sleep
curled up in my arms at night. His brother stayed up until 11 and
slept until 9. He had doughnuts for breakfast and cocoa before bed.
We didn't touch the pile of books he brought; he fell asleep to
SpongeBob on TV, with his cousins alongside.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the week has ended and the boys are gone, our house has
begun to settle down. And their house is in chaos, no doubt, as my
brother and his wife try to deal with the remnants of our
unscheduled-ness.</TE>
<TE>   But we did our job, the girls and I. The baby may not have slept
enough or eaten on time; his brother wasn't read to, didn't learn to
swim or ride a bike. But they made a week's worth of memories at Aunt
Sandy's house. And that's what vacations are for, after all.</TE>

<LD>Daring trapeze artists, squealing cancan dancers and huge bouquets of
scarlet roses set the mood for the "Moulin Rouge"-themed cocktail
party preceding the Hollywood Bowl Hall of Fame Gala and Concert.</LD>
<LD>   Partying alfresco on the Bowl grounds, guests were handed ruffled
garters as they swept along a red carpet taking them to a scene where
a streamer-festooned gazebo framed the bar and French-inspired
appetizers included mussels, escargots, mashed potatoes with salt cod
and petit croques monsieur.</LD>
<LD>   And that was just the beginning for the hundreds who paid $1,000
and up to join regular Bowl patrons for the tribute to Bernadette
Peters, Kathleen Battle, Randy Newman and the late George Harrison
while helping raise about $500,000 for Music Matters, the children's
education arm of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.</LD>
<TE>   The gala season opener also included primo seating in Bowl
boxes--decorated with red paper roses--where guests sipped fine wines
and dined on sirloin of lamb and chocolate tarts. Not to mention the
opportunity to enjoy music under the stars by the L.A. Philharmonic.
Welcoming the crowd, conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen noted that the third
annual event had become a tradition. "In my experience in Los
Angeles, when things happen twice, they are traditions," he quipped.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbing the 80-year-old Bowl "nature's concert hall--a tonic for
the senses," gala emcee Anthony Hopkins explained that the hall of
fame honorees were artists whose work "embodies the spirit of the
Bowl .... who have given unforgettable performances here."</TE>
<TE>   Pop diva Janet Jackson inducted opera star Battle, resplendent in
a black gown, multitiered ruffled cape and gardenias in her hair.
"Her voice is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Toy Story" creator John Lasseter inducted Newman, who recalled
his first visit to the Bowl: "I watched my uncle Alfred [Newman] do a
night of Gershwin," said the singer-composer. "It was a tremendously
moving experience. I'm deeply honored to be here, and yes, music does
matter--if it didn't, I'd be threading a pipe or driving a cab."</TE>
<TE>   Spouting the irreverent one-liners that characterized his Monty
Python days, Eric Idle paid tribute to his good friend Harrison at
the June 28 extravaganza: Upon learning that Harrison was to receive
the award, Idle told the guests, "My first thought was, 'I bet he
won't show up.'</TE>
<TE>   "He really wasn't into honors," Idle said. "George was one of
those people who believed that life is more important than show biz,
which I know is heresy in Hollywood. I can hear him saying, 'Oh, this
is very nice and useful, but where am I going to put it?' "</TE>
<TE>   Finally, performer Joel Grey introduced his close friend Peters
with an a cappella version of "Give My Regards to Broadway"--a
tribute to her glittering success there--saying all of her
performances have been "total truth onstage."</TE>
<TE>   Peters, stunning in a Bob Mackie lavender sheath with black lace
overlay, said that every time she visits the Bowl, her pulse starts
to race. "From the bottom of my fluttering heart, I thank you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, She Says</TE>
<TE>   Celebrating men who celebrate women, the Highlight Awards
recognized actors Edward James Olmos and Dennis Weaver and film
producer Daniel Melnick during a luncheon for 225 guests at the Four
Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Each received kudos from a woman who has played a significant role
in their lives: Paramount Chairwoman Sherry Lansing made the
presentation to good friend Melnick, chairman of IndieProd Co.; actor
Valerie Harper recognized longtime pal Weaver; and Olmos received the
nod from his mother, Eleanor Romo Olmos.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsored by the Women of Los Angeles and Pasadena, the awards are
handed out annually to men who have demonstrated "support for women
and the issues that are important to them," said organization founder
Gail Berendzen.</TE>
<TE>   "Eddie has a big heart," Olmos, 76, said of her son, an Academy
Award nominee ("Stand and Deliver") and producer of the anti-domestic
violence documentary "It Ain't Love." "He was always willing to give
help in school--especially to the girls."</TE>
<TE>   Taking the spotlight at the June 25 event, Olmos, 55, turned the
tables on his mother, a longtime community activist, saying she
deserved an award of her own. "I stand here in your shadow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Melnick, 70, is a mentor who encouraged her progression in the
studio system, Lansing said of the producer of films such as "All
That Jazz," "Altered States" and "Roxanne."</TE>
<TE>   Early on, he learned to "respect, fear and listen to women,"
Melnick told the crowd. "I was raised by my mother and older sister."</TE>
<TE>   Harper and Weaver are pals who share a common goal: feeding the
hungry. They founded a food distribution program that provided
thousands of meals to the underserved in Los Angeles in the '70s and
'80s.</TE>
<TE>   "Dennis is one of the great human beings of this world--an artist
whose work has touched our hearts," Harper said. "He has validated me
not only as a woman, but a person."</TE>
<TE>   Weaver, 77, probably best known for his cowboy-hat roles in
"Gunsmoke" and "McCloud," and whose book "All the World's a Stage"
(Hampton Roads) was recently published, is also an environmentalist.
"This award is awesome and humbling," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Event proceeds of about $30,000 will go toward mentoring,
education and support programs for women.</TE>

<TE>   Gesundheit!</TE>
<TE>   After a sold-out crowd jumped to its feet to applaud her
opening-night performance in "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife" at
the Ahmanson Theatre (through Aug.11), Valerie Harper got another
ovation when she arrived at the cast party June 26 in the Impresario
Restaurant at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved Valerie in the show--her energy and drive are amazing,"
said comedian Jo Anne Worley, joining about 350 guests who included
"Allergist" playwright Charles Busch, director Lynne Meadow and
Harper's co-stars Michele Lee, Tony Roberts and Shirl Bernheim.</TE>
<TE>   Portraying an affluent New Yorker in the throes of an "Is that all
there is?" midlife crisis has been fulfilling, said Harper, fresh
from playing the role on Broadway. "Her frustration is that of many
who are just sitting on their wealth and not experiencing joy. She
learns she has to get off the couch, roll up her sleeves. And she has
to accept her loved ones, warts and all--scream at them in the space
of love."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balancing Act</TE>
<TE>   Balancing wine glasses and plates, hundreds of foodies rode the
escalators at South Coast Plaza, sampling restaurant specialties set
up on three floors of the Costa Mesa retail center.</TE>
<TE>   "I call this two-fisted eating," said Shawn Henley, a guest at the
10th annual Summer Food &amp; Wine Festival on June 27 that raised
$70,000 to be divided between the Someone Cares Soup Kitchen and the
Food Distribution Center of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Among items up for tasting at tables topped with colorful summer
bouquets: mini cheese ravioli with pesto Alfredo sauce from
Maggiano's Little Italy; chocolate princess cake from the Champagne
French Bakery Cafe; and juicy summer berries dunked in chocolate from
Godiva Chocolatier.</TE>
<TE>   When guests had their fill, they worked it off by swaying to the
nostalgic sounds of the Zoot Suit Revue.</TE>

<LD>What kind of name is Rhonda Jaronda anyway? She walked into class
like she owned the world.</LD>
<LD>   "This is Rhonda Jaronda. She'll be joining your class." Our
principal introduced her right in the middle of my report on Mauna
Loa.</LD>
<LD>   "Rhonda moved here from Hawaii," our principal added.</LD>
<TE>   Ms. Murray said, "Rhonda, Kellie is giving a report on a Hawaiian
volcano. Feel free to contribute."</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda did feel free. I didn't finish my report. The kids asked
her questions until the recess bell. Ms. Murray gave me an A, but I
avoided Rhonda Jaronda. It wasn't easy, since her name was on
everybody's lips.</TE>
<TE>   One morning, I walked over to where Room 105 hangs out on the
playground. The key chains on my backpack jingled. I had 10 key
chains, more than anybody else in class. All the kids were gathered
around Rhonda Jaronda.</TE>
<TE>   She held a purple backpack. Twenty key chains dangled from it.</TE>
<TE>   "This one's from Florida," she said, pointing to a pewter mouse. I
stomped off and waited for someone to notice I was gone. Nobody did.</TE>
<TE>   My stomach rumbled like a bagel and cream cheese volcano.</TE>
<TE>   "What kind of name is Rhonda Jaronda anyway?" I mumbled at lunch.</TE>
<TE>   My best friend Mindy overheard me. "Kellie, she's really nice if
you give her a chance."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't answer. I got my lunch and walked to our table.</TE>
<TE>   Rhonda was already there, sitting in my spot. She was taking over
the whole school, including my best friend. I turned to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I saved a place for you," Rhonda called, " I wanted to find
out how you braid your hair like that."</TE>
<TE>   I sat down next to her. That's when I found out what kind of name
Rhonda Jaronda was. It was the name of a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Marlene Perez lives and writes in Orange County. The idea for
Rhonda Jaronda came from hearing the jingle-jangle of backpack key
chains at her children's school. This story will be on The Times' Web
site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Capitalism's Best Pals: Liberals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT L. BOROSAGE</AU>
<BD>Robert L. Borosage is co-director of the Campaign for
America's Future and editor of the Next Agenda.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Corporate corruption is a "moral cancer that ... is threatening this
great system and our economic health." These "sins of omission,
malfeasance and misfeasance" are "eroding shareholder value for all
corporations and public confidence in critical elements of our
economic system." This is a "betrayal of capitalism" in which the
"most fundamental principles of our market system were being
flouted."</LD>
<LD>   Corporate scourge Ralph Nader? Mirthful muckraker Michael Moore?
No, these quotes come from leaders of America's financial
community--Pete G. Peterson, Blackstone Group co-founder and former
U.S. Commerce secretary; John Snow, chairman and CEO of CSX Corp.;
and Felix Rohatyn, a former Lazard Freres partner. All are calling
for rapid, bold institutional and legal reforms to revive investor
confidence.</LD>
<LD>   But these financial giants are discovering that if they want to
save capitalism from itself, they'll have to rely on liberals to lead
the way.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the dire warnings from Wall Street, it is still business
as usual in Washington. The scandals have merely stirred dozens of
industry associations and hundreds of corporations into action to
bottle up even watered-down reform. For example, Thomas Donohue,
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued an "action call"
urging opposition to accounting reforms offered by Senate Banking
Committee Chairman Paul S. Sarbanes. He accused the Maryland Democrat
of having a "knee-jerk, politically charged reaction" to the Enron
scandal. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
which gave $14.7 million in campaign donations to both Democrats and
Republicans during the last election cycle, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, denounced Sarbanes' reforms as a "de facto
government takeover" of the profession.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican majority in the House has been happy to pass
legislation pre-approved by the business lobby. In the Senate, Phil
Gramm (R-Texas) has served as de facto administration point person.
Congressional Quarterly reported that he urged lobbyists to "stall,
stall, stall" to avoid reform legislation. Gramm denies the charge.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's initial response to Enron's bankruptcy
was to dismiss it. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the
company's fall was evidence of the "genius" of capitalism. As the
scandals have mounted, the administration has acknowledged, in the
president's words, "some bad apples" in the corporate world but
remains opposed to broad legal reform. Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the administration's lead
on the issue, has rejected most of the proposed reforms, such as
restrictions on stock options or conflict-of-interest limits on
auditors or stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   New Democrats and Blue Dog Democrats--the corporate money wing of
the party--have been reluctant reformers, at best. Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.)
has essentially punted, warning of the "twin dangers of doing too
little and doing too much." As Bruce Josten, executive vice president
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, crows, reform Democrats "have
problems on their side of the aisle, not just with Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   So, rescuing U.S. capitalism is left to liberals, just as it was
after the excesses of the 1920s led to the stock market crash and the
Great Depression. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has pushed for
pension reforms and legislation regulating stock analysts. Sarbanes'
bill, among other things, would create a new regulatory board to
monitor auditors and partly curb auditors' conflicts of interest by
prohibiting some types of consulting. Sen. Jon Corzine (D-N.J.),
former chairman of Goldman Sachs, has been the most vocal advocate of
significant legislation, often joined by Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), whose husband, Richard Blum, is a major investor. The two
senators have introduced a bill that would allow employees to invest
no more than 20% of their 401(k) funds in shares issued by their
employers. At the state level, New York's liberal attorney general,
Eliot Spitzer, exposed the conflicts plaguing stock analysts and
embarrassed Merrill Lynch into a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   But liberals don't have a majority in either house of Congress. So
despite the continuing scandals and the economic damage they may
cause, Corzine has warned that "it is unlikely that we will get
strong reform unless there is a new event that captures the
[public's] imagination." Even Martha Stewart's alleged insider
trading and WorldCom's staggering $3.9-billion exaggeration of
profits, which is giving new impetus to Sarbanes' accounting reform
bill and goading the president to speak out, may not suffice.</TE>
<TE>   At the turn of the 20th century, when the country was debating
what rules to impose on the emerging industrial economy, reformers
faced a similar dilemma. The dominant corporate Republican majority,
led by William McKinley and Mark Hanna, opposed new regulation.
Muckrakers and political movements helped push through change at the
state and local level, beginning with the eight-hour day, minimum
wage and basic fire and safety laws. Maverick Republican Theodore
Roosevelt laid out a larger agenda and made some progress. But the
market fundamentalists resisted regulation throughout the manic
1920s, until the stock market crash and the Great Depression
catapulted Franklin D. Roosevelt and a reform majority to power.</TE>
<TE>   The question is how to reform U.S. capitalism without having to
endure another crash. For this to happen, alarmed financial leaders
would be wise to ally themselves with reformers on Capitol Hill,
however uncomfortable that may be for them, and mobilize the
political clout represented by millions of small investors who have
watched their 401(k) plans plummet in value. To dramatize the urgency
of the matter, Sarbanes' Senate Banking Committee should stage a
televised hearing to establish just how perilous the current loss of
investor confidence is and how ideologically resistant some segments
of the business establishment are to reform. Then liberal Democrats
and financial gurus would be wise to enlist the Republican maverick,
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), to help lead the fight for the core
reforms on pension protection, auditor independence, stock options,
accounting standards and investment bank conflicts of interest.</TE>
<TE>   With sufficient exposure, President Bush, already scrambling to
limit the political fallout from burgeoning corporate scandals, might
even begin to support meaningful legislation. But for this to happen,
the conservative doyens of Wall Street must make public their common
cause with the few remaining liberals in the Congress.</TE>

<AU>MARC COOPER</AU>
<BD>Marc Cooper, a contributing editor to the Nation
magazine and LA Weekly's editor-at-large, spent his teenage summers
as a deckhand on Santa Monica sport fishing boats.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since my father first took me fishing--in 1955 when I was 5 years
old--rockfish have always been a sure thing in and around the Santa
Monica Bay. The swifter and splashier bonito would pass by for only a
few months in the summer and then--as the bay became more
polluted--just stopped coming around at all. Likewise with the fierce
and toothy barracudas. And significant "bites" by the mighty
yellowtail became infrequent enough to fall into the category of
near-legend.</LD>
<LD>   But throughout my youth and adolescence, just about any time of
the year I could board the Betty O or the orange-painted Kiora or the
diesel-belching Indiana sport fishing boats at a local pier and,
after a short run out of the bay, find the lumpy, lumbering rockfish
to be plentiful and hungry.</LD>
<LD>   There wasn't much art to hooking or landing these bug-eyed,
sharp-finned and brightly colored denizens of deeper, colder waters.
I'd load up a couple of leaders with wriggling anchovies and let a
big chunk of lead pull my line to the bottom. Usually within a few
minutes, a series of deep tugs would signal that the rockfish had
obliged. Then came the laborious task of cranking up the heavy catch.
There was none of the fight or challenge afforded by the
hard-striking bonito. None of the cunning of the elusive halibut.</LD>
<TE>   No, the catch of puffy, orange-red rock cod would come up to the
surface like so many wet burlap sacks. It was the most earnest sort
of fishing. The payoff wasn't in the struggle but rather in quantity
and quality. It was routine to limit out with a catch of 10. And
unlike the oily, gamy flesh of the bonito, the California rockfish
produced thick, white, meaty fillets.</TE>
<TE>   Made up of more than 80 species, and known commonly as red
snapper, rock cod, ling cod and bocaccio, these fish--which can live
50 or even 100 years--doggedly persisted in our waters even as other
species migrated or evaporated. Right up until last Sunday, local
amateur fisherman could catch a boat from Redondo Beach, Marina del
Rey, San Pedro or Oxnard and even with a rented pole and little
experience pretty much be guaranteed some sort of rock cod catch.</TE>
<TE>   But those days are now, abruptly, over. Since July 1, not only
California's commercial fishermen but also we recreational anglers
have effectively been prohibited from taking rock cod. After a
scientific study revealed that some rockfish stocks had been depleted
by as much as 95%, the Pacific Fishery Management Council--a hybrid
of state and federal regulators--ordered that rockfish in waters
deeper than 120 feet be off-limits. That's most of them. The measure
could hit California's commercial fishing industry like a tsunami and
will certainly rock the boats of local sport fishing operators.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to hit us real hard," says Ryan Peterson, manager of
San Pedro's L.A. Harbor Sportfishing. "It's going to affect our
business and a lot of others--everyone from the fuel dock to our food
suppliers to sporting good stores. You're going to see a big downturn
around here."</TE>
<TE>   But the ban--a stark reminder of the finite limits of the
environment we so often thoughtlessly exploit--was a long time in
coming and absolutely necessary. If anything, it was too little, too
late.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have known for years that our local rockfish weren't
reproducing in sufficient numbers. Some 20 years of poor ocean
conditions, El Nino episodes that have uncomfortably warmed the
waters for the cool-minded rock cod and general environmental
degradation have all taken their toll on this otherwise rugged
species.</TE>
<TE>   But government management--or mismanagement--of our marine
fisheries is also to blame. Hard to believe, but it wasn't until 1999
that the state of California as much as required itself to conduct an
annual scientific survey of the health and abundance of fish stock.
No surprise that the state was so lax. State ocean fisheries
management has been chronically underfunded and far too much
influenced by the commercial interests of the fishing industry. For
decades the state simply closed its eyes to the depletion of stock by
massive overfishing.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did government twiddle its thumbs as the crisis deepened,
it also helped create it. Worried about foreign competition, the
federal government in the 1970s offered tax breaks and low-interest
loans to domestic fishermen. Soon, commercial fleets were hungrily
scooping up millions of tons of fillet-rich rockfish in their
industrial-sized trawler nets.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law, however, requires that endangered fish species not
only be shielded from extinction but also be nurtured back up to 40%
of the level they were at before commercial fishing. It was on that
basis the Pacific council finally acted. But if palliative measures
had been taken earlier, the abrupt, draconian step implemented last
week might have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the new regulations aren't as tough and sweeping as
those recommended by council scientists, which means the regulatory
body is still postponing the inevitable. It's an open secret that
within the next few months the fishing ban is likely to be widened to
include Oregon and Washington and probably extended into shallower
waters. It might also affect other species. As big as the shock of
this first get-tough measure is, it should be seen as only the
beginning of an open-ended and uncertain process that could radically
redefine our relationship to the sea and its animal riches.</TE>
<TE>   Some local sportfishing operators claim that is all hooey and that
their livelihoods are being unfairly threatened. They point to the
current heavy bite of bocaccio--the rockfish species supposedly most
endangered. Anglers on half-day and three-quarter-day sport boats are
often limiting out on their catch this summer. "I think [the ban] is
extreme. I feel like the state wants to put us out of business,"
Peterson says. "Based on our own data, we've seen a decrease in size
of the rockfish but no real impact on the quantity."</TE>
<TE>   But marine biologists say that is precisely the problem. The
current crop of bocaccio is mostly 3-year-old fish born in 1999, when
there was an unexpectedly high survivorship of young fish. But since
there hadn't been a year like that in the preceding 20--nor has there
been one since--there is, to borrow a sports metaphor, a pretty thin
bench. The young bocaccio may, indeed, be plentiful this summer, but
there are few other fish in front of or in back of them and their
continued taking is just not sustainable.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the commercial fleet operators who took advantage of the
federal subsidies of the 1970s are now insisting they be economically
rescued. They are urging Congress to pass a $50-million "buy back" of
fishing boats, saying this is all the fault of the feds who first
lured them to fish so vigorously.</TE>
<TE>   Debating an industry bailout is only a distraction, however, from
the much tougher questions about our long-term relationship with the
environment. And if the scientists are right, we are going to have
plenty of time to calmly reflect on that issue. Biologists say that
it will be decades, maybe even as long as a century, before the
rockfish recover. No doubt these new regulations--and the ones sure
to follow--are going to put a big crimp in California fishing. But
that's better than winding up with no fishing at all.</TE>
<TE>   With some good luck, then, and maybe with some more painful
lessons taken to heart, my still unborn grandchildren will also be
able to experience the thrills I did when I was able to cast a line
into a bay teeming with obliging fish.</TE>

<HD>Terror's Aftermath</HD>
<DH>A convicted Hamas terrorist talks about his mission to
destroy Israel. The mother of a bombing victim talks about her
daughter and her pain.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Perhaps the most notorious figure in the suicide bombings that have
plagued Israel in recent years, Hassan Salameh orchestrated the wave
of attacks that terrorized Israel during the run-up to Israel's 1996
elections. It was the bombings he coordinated, many believe, that
resulted in Labor Prime Minister Shimon Peres losing the close
election to Likud Party candidate Benjamin Netanyahu, who promised
"peace with security." Salameh was ultimately arrested and convicted
of being responsible for 46 deaths, for which he is now serving 46
consecutive life sentences in an Israeli prison. The following
interview was conducted in prison as part of a project supported by
the Smith Richardson Foundation in which 35 incarcerated religious
extremists and secular terrorists were extensively interviewed to
explore their life histories, motivations and how, in the case of the
religious extremists, they came to rationalize "killing in the name
of God."</LD>
<TE>   Salameh was born in 1971. He was raised in a relatively well-off
family in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. In high
school, he took part in the first intifada and joined Hamas. As he
succeeded in the organization, he was promoted to organize and
coordinate suicide bombings. The passion of his convictions served as
a siren song to alienated Palestinian youth in the refugee camps,
where he successfully persuaded them  to carry out their violent
acts. What follows is a transcript of his interview, which has been
edited for length:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We were a normal, well-established and respected refugee camp
family. All the children went to school and were considered
well-behaved. No one in the family was involved in criminal
activities; most used to pray in the mosque. Within the family we
never discussed politics, and our social standing was good.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, I used to listen a lot to the radio and developed a keen
political awareness. Like some of my brothers, I used to pray in the
mosque and attend religious lessons. My leaning toward Islam was
clear and coherent.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the intifada I joined Hamas. I was recruited by a
friend from the camp. My joining-up was the normal thing to do, as
all the young people were enlisting. I joined in Hamas activities in
the camp, mainly demonstrations, rallies, stone-throwing and other
public disturbances.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, I was recruited to the Hamas shock troops in the camp by
a friend in the movement. Our task was to defend the organization
against infiltration by undesirable elements and to wage war on
corruption, negative social trends like theft, prostitution and drugs
and, of course, on traitors.</TE>
<TE>   As members of a cell, we attacked suspected collaborators with
Israel, some of whom were put to death. In order to get the truth out
of suspected collaborators when we interrogated them, we used to
break their legs and arms with iron bars and chains and to stab them
with knives. It was not cruelty for its own sake, but the way an
underground organization has to operate in occupied territory.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of 1993, after the other members of my cell had been
detained and interrogated by the Israeli security forces, I was
forced to flee. With the aid of a forged Egyptian passport, I fled to
Jordan across the Allenby Bridge. From Jordan I went to Sudan, where
I worked in the Hamas offices in Khartoum for eight months.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of 1993, we began to put pressure on the Hamas
leaders in Sudan to allow us to undergo advanced military training.
We wanted to acquire a high level of skill so that when we returned
to Palestine we would have enhanced operational capabilities. The
organization arranged a training camp for us and flew us to Syria and
then to Iran.</TE>
<TE>   [In the camp, Salameh learned to handle various weapons, to
prepare and place bombs, to gather intelligence and to lay ambushes.
He was helped to obtain another forged passport and given money to
get back to the Palestinian territories.]</TE>
<TE>   Soon after we crossed into Gaza, we were captured by people from
the Palestinian Authority and jailed for 7 1/2 months. On my release,
I met senior activists from [Hamas'] military wing, Izz a-Din
al-Qassam, including the commander in Gaza. I became [his] right-hand
man and helped him assemble charges and grenades from TNT, based on
what I learned in my training in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   [At the beginning of 1996, after the Israelis killed a Hamas
leader, Salameh was put in charge of a plan to avenge the death. An
East Jerusalem cell was activated.]</TE>
<TE>   Another cell, which specialized in stealing cars, got hold of an
Israeli vehicle and brought it to the orange groves near Ashdod. I
was [given money], names of accomplices in the Jerusalem area,
telephone numbers and code words for communication and photographs of
the people involved so that it would be easier for me to recognize
them.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by three recruits, carrying three suitcases of TNT, as well
as a smaller bag with two pistols and six hand grenades, I
infiltrated from Gaza into Israel proper through a hole in the
electric fence, prepared in advance by one of our cells. We buried
all the equipment in the orange grove area near Ashdod, in a place
that had been prepared in advance by the vanguard cell.</TE>
<TE>   In Hebron I made contact with Hamas activists I knew from my time
in jail [and also with someone] I had met in Lebanon. [Eventually],
the head of the Islamic Faction came to me with the news that he had
found two people willing to carry out suicide missions. I met the two
young men and took them to my safe house in Abu Dis. I prepared two
charges, each with 12 kilos of TNT, half a kilo of nails of different
sizes and round metal pellets. I put everything into nylon bags, and
attached batteries and detonators. Then I put each explosive charge
into a bag.</TE>
<TE>   I explained to the two men how to activate the charges and when to
prime them. I then left them with orders to carry out the bombings
the next day and made my way to my safe house in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, one of the suicide bombers was taken into Jerusalem
by a member of the Jerusalem cell, where he got onto a No. 18 bus
with the explosive charge. Within minutes, he detonated the bomb,
blowing himself and some of the passengers up. More than 25 people
were killed.</TE>
<TE>   The second [bomber] was taken by the other member of the Jerusalem
cell to the Ashkelon junction by car. There he was instructed to wait
at a soldiers' pickup point and to blow himself up. In the bombing, a
woman soldier was killed and many others wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the two bombings, I asked [the same man] to
recruit another bomber. He told me that there was another young
student ready to carry out a suicide mission, and we agreed that he
would bring him to me the following day.</TE>
<TE>   After I had met the young man, and he had expressed his
willingness to carry out the mission, I put him up in the safe house.
There I assembled another explosive bag and taught the young man how
to operate it. When the members of the Jerusalem cell arrived, I
instructed them to take the young man the next day to a No. 18 bus
for the bombing. Everything went according to plan, and about a week
after the first two bombings, there was another bus bombing in which
about 20 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   After these operations, the Israeli and Palestinian security
services launched a massive manhunt for me. I was randomly stopped at
an Israeli Defense Forces roadblock and wounded in the ensuing
exchange of fire. I managed to get away, but the security services
caught up with me in a Hebron hospital, and here I am.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, my family supports me and the organization. My
activities aside, two of my brothers were expelled to Marj Zahour.
One remained abroad, and the other is serving a 30-year sentence.
Most of the general community supports the recruits, although some,
through fear of the consequences, might hesitate to provide aid or to
admit their support.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, my standing among the members of the organization rose,
and I have no doubt that members of other organizations respect me
too. Every young Palestinian knows who Hassan Salameh is. But my
standing is not important. What is important is that Hamas, God
willing, achieves its goal.</TE>
<TE>   In general, any organization that fights for the liberation of
Palestine is a good thing. But we need to distinguish between
religious and secular organizations. Religious organizations
understand that we also have to fight for Islam and not only for the
nation and the land.</TE>
<TE>   Fatah is a good, positive organization, but mistaken in its
ideology and deeds. I have brothers who support Fatah, and despite
the great arguments between us, I love and respect them. Still you
must understand that Fatah, in its concessions to Israel, its
recognition of the state of Israel and its joining in the peace
process, is totally unacceptable to me. You also realize that it was
Fatah as the Palestinian Authority that arrested me for seven months.</TE>
<TE>   I know you try to depict us as immoral and cruel, but that is a
distortion in its own right. The rules in the war game are not equal.
We don't have tanks and planes, and only painful attacks can achieve
the organization's goals. If my commanders were to tell me tomorrow
to carry out a suicide bombing, I would pick up the explosive
suitcase without a moment's hesitation and do it.</TE>
<TE>   As for the peace process, I personally am against it. It entails
recognition of Israel, and that runs counter to Islam and Hamas. Even
if [the Israelis] were to withdraw to the 1967 lines, give us
Jerusalem and the right of return, we should not recognize Israel.
All of Palestine, from the sea to the river, must constitute the
Islamic Palestinian State.</TE>
<TE>   I am not a murderer. A murderer is someone with a psychological
problem; armed actions have a goal. Even if civilians are killed,
it's not because we like it or are bloodthirsty. It is a fact of life
in a people's struggle against a foreign occupier. A suicide bombing
is the highest level of jihad and highlights the depth of our faith.
The bombers are holy fighters who carry out one of the more important
articles of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   I always saw Israelis as murderers and as an occupying enemy who
had inflicted pain on us, and who were still hurting us, and who must
be expelled from our land by whatever means.</TE>

<DH>The mother of a bombing victim talks about her daughter and
her pain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN KAUFMAN</AU>
<BD>Alan Kaufman is the author of the memoir "Jew Boy."</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Among the dead at the Sbarro restaurant here last summer were two
best friends, Malki Roth, 15, and Michal Raziel, 16. Their story is
not all that different from those of hundreds of other victims of
suicide bombers. They stopped one evening for a slice of pizza. It
turned out they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.</LD>
<LD>   Suicide bombings of Israel's shopping malls, cafes, restaurants,
discotheques and buses often target women and children and have
turned this nation's once lively cities into ghost towns, its brave
people into anxious wrecks. Yet rarely in the extensive media
coverage of these horrors do we learn about the price in human terms
for the average person. What lies behind the front page images of
twisted steel and mangled limbs? What happens to those left behind?</LD>
<LD>   Meet Malki's mother, Frimet Roth.</LD>
<TE>   Roth lives in Ramot, a stark housing development baking on the
hills that swell Jerusalem's northern approaches. Despite its
nearness to the city's heart, the nondescript suburb is, by
Palestinian definition, "over the Green Line," a West Bank
settlement. It is ostensibly because of places like this that suicide
bombers like Izzedine Masri, the Hamas operative from Jenin who blew
himself up at the Sbarro restaurant, feel justified in taking
innocent lives.</TE>
<TE>   In her flat, Roth knows exactly how to begin our conversation. She
goes into another room and brings back a picture of her daughter,
Malki, and her friend Michal, then studies it before handing it to
me. "This is them," she says.</TE>
<TE>   They appear, like so many girlfriends of that age, complementary
(Malki the fair-haired dreamer, dark-haired Michal more down to
earth). Each smiles brightly, as if dazzled by all the promise they
embodied.</TE>
<TE>   We look at the photograph, discuss how beautiful the girls were.
Roth begins speaking of her daughter. "She was a very unusual child
in that she had high ideals which she strove always to live up to.
Three weeks before her murder she had volunteered in a camp up north
for handicapped kids."</TE>
<TE>   Always musical, Malki had lately played a guitar on loan from her
school. "Her friends told me afterward that she would take it out on
the bus to school and play. Michal also played guitar. They would all
sing. She was a dream of a child. The worst thing she did was mess up
her room."</TE>
<TE>   During the final year of her life, Malki, like all Israelis, had
to cope with a rising tide of violence. "[There was] death all around
her. She thought about it a lot," her mother says. "Every day were
new terrorist attacks. In her diary she marked them down, with the
names of the victims, their ages, details of what happened. As if she
knew them. Some of her friends traveled each day on a road where
there was constant shooting. Sometimes they stayed here overnight
because it was unsafe to return home. One of them told me: 'I kiss my
parents each morning before school because I'm not sure I'll see them
at night.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, her mother says, Malki "never imagined that she was going
to an unsafe place when she went to Sbarro."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the bombing, Malki and Michal went to see a friend
who'd just returned home from overseas. Then they headed for a
meeting of summer camp youth leaders. On the way, apparently, the
girls decided to stop off for pizza. "When I saw the news of the
bombing on television," her mother recalls, "I didn't worry about her
because I thought she had already gone to the meeting."</TE>
<TE>   Reflexively, she placed a call to her daughter's cell phone.
Knowing how the volume of cell phone calls after a bombing can
overwhelm the system, Roth didn't think much about not being able to
reach her daughter. But by late afternoon she had grown anxious. It
was unlike Malki not to check in to reassure her mother that
everything was OK. "I called up the summer camp office to see if
she'd arrived for the meeting. They said she hadn't. Now I truly
worried," Roth recalls. "I went to the hospital with my neighbor,
Aviva, Michal's mother, and on the way Aviva got a call from her
other children who said a friend had told them that Malki had called
earlier to say: 'Meet us at Sbarro. Michal and I are going there for
a bite before the meeting.' When I heard this I began screaming and
crying.... I knew, I knew."</TE>
<TE>   In the months since the bombing, Roth has grown increasingly
bothered by world reaction to the Palestinian bombings. "I read a lot
of newspapers, I watch the news. And I see my pain being ignored,
discarded. [I see] the reality of what we are going through totally
distorted, so that our pain does not exist.... I only wish that
Israel had our soldiers into the territories, to get the terrorists
before Malki was murdered. She'd be alive today.... But,
unfortunately, our government held back, restrained itself, as
instructed, time and time again, 'Just hold back, don't react.' And,
we didn't. So she and another 151 died after. Finally, we did
something sane and reasonable and the world is jumping on our backs,
pointing fingers. It's preposterous.</TE>
<TE>   "When America went into Afghanistan and just bombed away from the
sky, we have no idea how many civilians were killed in those raids.
When did we ever hear a total tally? No one cares. Here, we didn't
bomb from the sky. We moved in and fought house to house, so that we
lost soldiers, we did it the most dangerous way to ourselves, facing
an enemy that hides among their own women and children,
booby-trapping their own houses, yet in the eyes of the world we're
the villains!"</TE>

<BD>Mitchell Koss is a producer for Channel One News. His
work has appeared on public television's "Nova" and "The NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer" and on ABC and MTV.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month, I did a few laps in Pyongyang--literally--to correct a
deficiency in American punditry. That is, to paraphrase Mark Twain,
everybody talks about the axis of evil, but few have bothered to
check out its lines.</LD>
<LD>   In 1996, I went to Iraq to report on life after the Gulf War. I've
reported from Iran several times over the last decade. But it wasn't
until last month that I completed the third leg of my Axis of Evil
World Tour with a trip to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</LD>
<LD>   In many ways, it's hard to figure what President Bush was thinking
when he linked the three countries. Iran is a theocracy. Iraq is a
strongman state. And North Korea is a museum piece, our last living
relic of totalitarianism. Now that I've spent time in all three
places, I have some ideas about how they're connected, although I'm
not sure they're the links the president had in mind.</LD>
<TE>   But first, let me explain the circumstances of my North Korea
visit. If you follow news of the Hermit Kingdom, you're probably
aware that the brass there were not pleased about South Korea's
triumphant moment in the world spotlight as co-host with Japan of
soccer's World Cup. In fact, it galled the North Koreans so much that
the world's most closed-off country decided to stage a mass
exhibition by thousands of gymnasts, an event it named the Arirang
festival, after the most popular traditional folk song in both
Koreas.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a catch. In order for the Arirang festival to draw
attention away from the World Cup, the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea, which admits almost nothing from the outside world--no TV,
movies, books, newspapers, Internet or even visitors without
high-level invitations--would have to let in at least a few tourists.
So in May, two colleagues and I went to a Koreatown travel agent,
paid $1,350-plus air fare each and filled out applications to travel
to North Korea. Foreign journalists weren't being invited, so my
colleagues and I went simply as interested U.S. citizens.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, 29 of us from various parts of the U.S.--along with
our three police escorts--were on a bus heading from the airport to
Pyongyang. We made an obligatory stop to place flowers and bow in
front of a gigantic bronze statue of Kim Il Sung, the DPRK's "eternal
president," despite having died in 1994. And so our tour began--five
days and four nights in a country rarely seen by outsiders. We had
two home video cameras and the desperate hope that we could pass as
tourists even though everyone on the tour was Korean American except
for me and one of my colleagues, and our tour guides/police escorts
spoke only Korean.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, the best journalism on North Korea is done from the
outside, by interviewing defectors in Seoul or seeking out the tens
of thousands of refugees from famine who are hiding in northern
China. That's because North Korea isn't the kind of place where it's
easy to see anything the government doesn't want you to see--which is
not the case in Iraq and overwhelmingly not the case in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Our first night in Pyongyang, our police escorts took us on a
walking tour of the city. Leaving our hotel, we turned left, went
down to the corner, crossed the street via a pedestrian underpass and
that was it. Halfway to the corner, one of our escorts told me that
I'd shot enough video and could stop now. As we were walking back to
the hotel, I mentioned that I wanted to go jogging in the morning.
Our escorts told me that this would not be possible. I persisted: I
live in L.A. We jog. Beyond that, I'd jogged in Iran, I'd jogged in
Iraq, and if I were to truly research this axis business, I needed to
jog in North Korea. Finally, our escorts said they would meet me in
the lobby at 6 a.m. They did. While they stood in front of the hotel
smoking, I was allowed to run back and forth between two light
poles--an obsessive-compulsive sort of exercise I've witnessed while
doing stories in the yards of California's state prisons. It seemed
somehow normal, as I felt imprisoned myself.</TE>
<TE>   Our lives were completely controlled. The radios in the hotel
rooms, for example, had buttons, not dials, to prevent anyone from
dialing in a South Korean station. Only one button worked. My Korean
American colleague said she listened one night to an announcer
warning people that foreigners were in town for the festival and not
to talk to them.</TE>
<TE>   Pyongyang is desperately poor, and the signs of that poverty are
everywhere. The city's streets have almost no cars and--startlingly
compared with China--very few bicycles. People walk. At night, large
parts of the city go dark as the electricity is simply cut off.</TE>
<TE>   The Korean American man who sat next to me on the bus and who has
relatives in North Korea told me that most people were still eating
one meal a day, despite an increase in last year's harvest and a
slight easing of the famine that had killed an estimated 2 million
North Koreans since 1995. In the countryside, farmers plow with oxen
and build roads and bridges by hand, carrying rocks on pallets.
People drink out of ditches and harvest wild vegetation to supplement
their food supplies. None of this we were allowed to videotape,
except on the afternoon of the last day when, having had too much
beer and sun at lunch, all three police escorts fell asleep on the
bus, leaving us free to shoot out of the windows.</TE>
<TE>   While I wasn't able to see much of what I would have found most
interesting in North Korea, I did see a lot more of Kim Il Sung,
including his birthplace and a life-size wax statue set in the kind
of nature diorama that the L.A. Museum of Natural History uses for
displaying taxidermic animals. I saw the exhibition by tens of
thousands of massed gymnasts, which I must concede is a truly
impressive feat on the part of the DPRK, even allowing the
probability that there were no wage costs involved. I also ate dog
meat and bonded with our police escorts to the extent of conceding
that it's not extraordinarily evil to seek employment as an oppressor
if you live in a police state. When we flew back to Beijing, my first
thought was relief at being back in a "free" country.</TE>
<TE>   My second thought was that the North Korean government can't
possibly last. And that brings up the first thing that the nations of
the axis seem to have in common. With or without the wrath of George
W., it's difficult to imagine that any of these regimes will be
around a whole lot longer. In South Korea, the question seems to be
not whether reunion with the North will happen but how to manage it
so that the South's now-stellar economy doesn't take too big a hit.</TE>
<TE>   In Iran, the ruling ayatollahs have been on the defensive for
years. Many brave people are fighting the guardians of the Islamic
Republic to increase democracy--everyone from journalists and
intellectuals to middle-class kids who love U.S. culture to poor
people who can no longer stand the stifling lack of social and
economic opportunity. In recent years, they've been joined in their
struggle by the elected president, Mohammad Khatami, and the elected
majority in parliament. There were plenty of great jogging routes
from my hotel in northern Tehran past the notorious Evin prison. The
only drawback was that modesty laws forced me to wear sweatpants even
though it was more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and because women
can't wear sweatpants, my female colleagues couldn't jog at all.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, less free than Iran has become, but also less
ideological, the regime seems to require nothing of people other than
that they not challenge it--hardly the stance of a long-lived entity.
In Iraq, joggers can wear anything, and both sexes can participate,
but a lack of sidewalks and general congestion make the streets of
Baghdad unpleasant.</TE>
<TE>   According to those kinds of sources who won't be named, North
Korea earns hard currency by exporting ballistic-missile technology
to countries like Iran and Iraq. Which brings us to another
commonality. All three countries are nonfriendly nations with the
capability of hitting the U.S. or one of its allies with a missile.
The president doesn't seem to worry so much about countries with
missiles--even if they aren't our allies--as long as we have strong
commercial ties with them, as we now do with nuclear-armed China. But
if they're openly opposed to us, have weapons and don't have trade
ties, it's another story.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, that lack of trade ties served us well in the DPRK.
Because people there have no experience with the outside world, our
escorts never developed the sort of suspicions they should have had
about us, and we were able to complete our tour without being
expelled. But that isolation will also prevent anyone in Pyongyang
from reading this article. There are no Internet links in the entire
country. Otherwise, I'd end by thanking the North Koreans for
allowing me a glimpse of their country, however restricted.</TE>

<AU>PATRICIA NELSON LIMERICK and WILLIAM TRAVIS</AU>
<BD>Patricia Nelson Limerick, a professor of history and
environmental studies, is the author of "Something in the Soil:
Legacies and Reckonings in the New West." William Travis, a professor
of geography, is the editor of the Atlas of the New West. Both work
at the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado.</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>If you live here and try not to think about fire, you've got a big
job ahead of you. The sky is a gray haze because of the Front Range
fires. The effects of drought are everywhere: You are allowed to
water your lawn twice a week for 15 minutes. The forests immediately
to our west are as dry as our lawns; that these dry trees are not
burning is a state of grace that we're not taking for granted.</LD>
<LD>   Fire sweeping through Western forests and grasslands is the oldest
story both in and outside town. It's a story that began long before
rural subdivisions spread into the forests.</LD>
<LD>   Before we had the federal government and aggressive fire
protection to blame for our troubles, Indians often watched smoke
fill the air as trees and grasses burned. Sometimes lightning started
the fires; sometimes the Indians used fire to encourage conditions
more favorable to game. Either way, the Western forests burned.</LD>
<TE>   Combine lots of biomass (aka, plants) with an arid or semiarid
climate and fire is an entirely predictable feature of regional life.
Yet an unwillingness to let the recognition of risk restrict
individual freedom is an equally predictable feature of Western life.
In the summer of 2002, these two dynamics have collided: Never before
have so many Western homes been located, voluntarily and even
willfully by their builders and owners, in the line of fire.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the Western dream is an individual who insists on
making his own choices and refuses petty regulation. The Western
landscape is rugged and tough, but the Westerner is more rugged--and
tougher. He settles where he wants to and lives according to his own,
self-reliant terms.</TE>
<TE>   Until, that is, he needs help.</TE>
<TE>   The Western dream has a golden parachute, a bail-out sequence, an
escape clause and an exit plan. Pioneers intruded into Indian
territory, and when they got themselves into a mess, the Army arrived
to protect them and remove the Indians. Farmers tried to grow crops
in places with low rainfall, and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation built
the dams and reservoirs that filled in for the rain. Homeowners
wanted to live in houses with stunning views, and counties built the
roads and supplied the services to make these sites accessible and
livable.</TE>
<TE>   Western risk-taking has often relied on this back-up plan: We get
ourselves in a pinch and the government--local, state and
federal--rushes to get us out of it. Nature presents challenges that
are at once dangerous and appealing, but human ingenuity and
government funding quickly drain the danger out of these challenges
and leave only their appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Will the fires of 2002 lead to a different outcome? In the
mountains of the West, Americans seek tranquillity, leisure and
escape from the tension and friction of normal life. A landscape in
flames, with fire bearing down on an architect-designed dream house,
rebukes this vision with a force that should challenge our
perceptions and the customs that flow from them.</TE>
<TE>   But how justified is such a hope? Will a different, wiser West
arise from the ashes of this summer?</TE>
<TE>   Disaster will not necessarily discourage settling in the forest, a
lesson Westerners might have imported from the East. People are still
drawn to sites along the hurricane-vulnerable East Coast, even though
a single hurricane can destroy a far greater number of homes than a
whole season of Western forest fires. The Mississippi River floods
repeatedly, and yet development of flood plains has not significantly
slowed. Government programs to buy out storm-damaged homes pale in
comparison with (and achieve a whole lot less popularity than) those
that fund the rebuilding of communities.</TE>
<TE>   And a season of fire, unlike a hurricane or flood, can even give a
reassuring sense that now that misfortune has occurred, its
recurrence is unlikely, thus nearly eliminating danger in the near
future.</TE>
<TE>   In some unexpected ways, the fires may strengthen the belief that
the West is still an exciting, adventurous, wild place. Resilient
real estate agents may already be at work on the new ads:</TE>
<TE>   "Special home site with views unmarred by trees. Feel safe in the
wide open spaces close to nature; recent fire means little hazard for
the life of your mortgage! Improved habitat very likely to attract
elk, bears and mountain lions to your viewscape."</TE>
<TE>   Along with a weakness for real estate agents, Westerners have a
deep-rooted hostility to regulation and are die-hard advocates of the
rights of private-property owners. These attitudes are, apparently,
inflammable; fire passes over them and leaves no mark. Few rural
areas have any zoning, and many get along without building codes, not
to mention the sort of regulations that might reduce fire hazards.</TE>
<TE>   The human mind comes well-equipped with a set of time-sensitive
blinders. Past and future danger falls out of the range of vision. If
unpleasantness comes to a merciful end, and a comfortable present is
restored, the lessons of history fade quickly from view. But every
now and then, a lesson sticks.</TE>
<TE>   In the 19th century, nearly every newly founded U.S. city or town
endured a big fire, sometimes two or three. San Francisco blazed
spectacularly several times; cities in the interior U.S.--Denver and
Spokane, for example--similarly went up in flames. After one or two
rounds of rebuilding with wood, a shift to brick and masonry in
downtown buildings demonstrated that a lesson had, at last, been
learned.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, city regulations produced this change. Sometimes, it
was common sense. But before common sense reported for duty, a
remarkable amount of effort went into gathering and transporting
wood, stacking it up into structures, watching the structures burn,
and then repeating the whole peculiar process.</TE>
<TE>   The practices of our times might strike detached observers as
equally mysterious. Westerners have stacked up flammable material in
remote locations, embedding these structures in forests that burn
episodically. A visitor from an entirely different culture might
wonder: Could this be a religious ritual, a purposeful challenge to
fate, or a sacrifice of wealth to the universe's greater powers?</TE>
<TE>   Or is it simply an assertion of the Westerners' right to settle
the land as they please, without bowing to social or natural
constraints?</TE>
<TE>   When Daniel Boone found that his isolation had been breached, and
he could see the smoke rising from his neighbors' chimneys, he felt
compelled to move on. When today's settlers see the smoke rising from
their neighbors' living rooms and bedrooms, what actions will that
frightening sight inspire? Can the minds of Boone's ideological
descendants expand to embrace the idea that the constraints of
society have something to recommend them? Can those who celebrate
Western freedom bend to the recognition that regulation and
restriction are not always petty and intrusive but sometimes wise?</TE>
<TE>   Over the last few decades, many people who have lost homes to
disaster have shown great pluck, reckoned with their losses and
plunged in to rebuild. And, with an admirable generosity, Americans
have responded to other people's calamities with a "barn-raising"
spirit, albeit a barn-raising aided by insurance and federal and
state relief. But should pluck and generosity outweigh foresight and
caution?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe our response to wildfire will, in the long run, differ from
our response to floods, hurricanes and other disasters. Our fellow
humans who risk their lives to save us and our property from fire are
much more visible (though their counterparts appear during floods and
hurricanes, too). Our yellow-shirted knights, some of whom literally
drop out of the sky, prove that none of us is an independent Daniel
Boone when it comes to coping with fire. Their stories, sometimes
tragic, touch us. They remind us that even on the edge of wilderness,
we are embedded in society and our actions affect the lives of
others.</TE>
<TE>   The fires of 2002 present an opportunity to reevaluate our habits
and practices, and to see, through the smoke now clouding many
Western skies, a different, less complacent, more responsible way to
inhabit the West.</TE>

<KH>CALIFORNIA ECONOMY</KH>
<HD>The Dollar Doldrums</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCK O'CONNELL</AU>
<BD>Jock O'Connell is an international business consultant.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As if they don't have enough to agonize over, California budget
writers might want to add the shrinking U.S. dollar to their list of
economic bogeymen.</LD>
<LD>   After appreciating 5% in 2000 and another 6% last year, the dollar
peaked in February. Since then, it has been falling against both the
Japanese yen and the euro. As of last week, the dollar had declined
by more than 14% from its February peak against the two currencies
and by greater than 7% against the British pound.</LD>
<LD>   Most observers believe the dollar will continue its slide. The
only question seems to be whether its eventual landing will be hard
or soft.</LD>
<TE>   So, how will this affect California's budget?</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't a cheaper dollar stimulate economic growth (and generate
more tax revenue) by boosting overseas demand for U.S. goods?
Shouldn't it make California a more desirable vacation destination
for foreigners, as well as for Americans whose dollars don't
purchases as much abroad as they did last year?</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes, but ....</TE>
<TE>   Barring another terrorist offensive, California's travel and
tourism industry should benefit from a shrinking dollar. For everyone
else--including exporters--the fallout is apt to range from mixed to
undesirable. As a result, the economic expansion that California's
political leaders are banking on to help bridge the chasm between
revenues and expenditures may prove far less robust than hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Last February, the Legislative Analyst's Office cautioned that the
state faced not only an unprecedented revenue shortfall in the
2002-03 fiscal year but "an operating deficit in the range of $7
billion [that] would likely persist for some time." Since then, the
state's fiscal picture has darkened substantially, forcing Gov. Gray
Davis and the Legislature to adopt measures that effectively spread a
portion of today's deficit into future years. The scheme will work
only if California's economy recovers enough to generate the tax
revenues needed to cover the burden.</TE>
<TE>   The economic forecast underlying the governor's May budget
revision contains a number of assumptions: that California's economy
has already emerged from the 2001 recession; that consumer spending
will continue to increase gradually; that businesses will resume
capital investment toward the end of this year; that the colossal
dollops of dollars the Bush administration wants to spend on defense
and homeland security will spur California industry to higher rates
of expansion in 2003 and thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   There is no question that tens of billions of dollars of defense
and security spending will help revive important parts of
California's economy, especially the electronics, aerospace and
biotechnology sectors. There is less certainty about future consumer
and business spending, the real driving forces of a capitalist
economy.</TE>
<TE>   While U.S. fiscal policy may be turning more expansionary, the
nation's monetary policy could move sharply in the opposite direction
as a direct consequence of the dollar's continued deterioration. A
weaker dollar makes imported goods more expensive, and given our
immoderate dependence on imports--from luxury cars to
bargain-basement clothing and toys--any drop in the dollar's value
implies another import: inflation.</TE>
<TE>   As inflationary pressures grow, the Federal Reserve Board can be
expected to push up interest rates, which will increase the cost of
corporate and consumer borrowing. Higher rates will retard economic
expansion. Even worse, they also drive up the cost of bonds issued by
state and local governments.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar's decline represents a two-edged sword for California
exporters. Because a diminished dollar should spur export growth by
making our goods and services cheaper abroad, many smaller exporters
should benefit.</TE>
<TE>   However, the majority of California's export trade is conducted by
large multinational corporations that sit at the nexus of intricate
global supply chains. More than half of the state's merchandise
exports are shipped to parties within the same corporate family as
the shipper. Similarly, about 40% of California's imports come from
parties related to the importer.</TE>
<TE>   With so much trade conducted intramurally, the effect of a
declining dollar on state exports will probably be less stimulating
than standard economic models would predict. What is more certain is
that companies in California will see the earnings of their overseas
subsidiaries yield fewer dollars when repatriated.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar need not plummet suddenly for the worst to happen. One
commonly used definition of a hard landing is a currency correction
that undermines confidence in other classes of dollar-denominated
assets. Analysts at Morgan Stanley, for example, refer to a possible
"sell America scenario" in which investors, spooked by undisciplined
currency markets, precipitously divest themselves of U.S. stocks,
bonds and real property. While few analysts think this a likely
scenario, even a milder version could further shake the U.S.
securities markets, undermine the value of U.S. companies and raise
the cost of both public and private borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   A weaker greenback would also have some local effects, especially
for businesses reliant on imports. Thus, the ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach would probably see a significant falloff in activity.
Together, they constitute the nation's premier maritime trade
gateway. Yet both are primarily funnels for imported goods, handling
$166.4 billion worth, versus just $33.3 billion in exports in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   All these factors add up to (or subtract from) the likelihood that
state tax revenues will recover as briskly as those crafting the
state budget in Sacramento may hope. As long as the dollar continues
its decline, betting on tax revenues to grow substantially over the
next few years is a dicey proposition.</TE>
<TE>   There's one other thing. Much to the annoyance of real nations,
the state's political leaders regularly boast that California, with
its $1.3-trillion economy, tops France and Italy and is rapidly
closing in on Britain. A TV ad sponsored by Davis' reelection
campaign questioning Republican challenger Bill Simon Jr.'s business
acumen concludes by asking whether Simon is up to running "the
world's fifth-largest economy." Well, as luck would have it, the
sliding dollar could well ensure that, come election day, whoever
wins will find himself presiding over an economy that has dropped a
peg or two in the standings.</TE>

<AU>TONY QUINN</AU>
<BD>Tony Quinn is co-editor of the California Target Book,
a nonpartisan analysis of California legislative and congressional
elections.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>At last, California seems on the verge of confronting, and doing
something about, one of the great absurdities of U.S. politics--the
length of our campaign season. With luck, a bill shortening the time
between the primary and the general election will pass this year.</LD>
<LD>   More than four months have elapsed since the March 5 primary, yet
it is still nearly four months to the November general election.
Between the California primary and general election, baseball will
have gone through spring training, the regular season and the World
Series.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators of both parties in California realize how ridiculous
this is, and Senate Bill 1975, by Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), has a
good chance to correct the problem in time for the 2004 elections.
Nothing the Legislature does this year will be more important to
democracy than shortening the state's yearlong election season.</LD>
<TE>   Candidates seeking to be sworn in as new legislators in December
2002 had to begin filing campaign papers before last Thanksgiving. We
now have a shadow Legislature: Candidates nominated in safe districts
in March and who will be formally elected in November to replace
termed-out legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's legislation initially called for moving California's
primary to September, when 15 other states nominate candidates for
office. The advantage of a September date is that candidates need run
only one campaign until the general election. Such a change would, in
effect, be a major campaign-finance reform. Since campaigns would be
less expensive, candidates would not be forced to raise money to
cover two separate elections.</TE>
<TE>   But elections officials have balked at a September date. They
contend it gives them too little time to certify candidates and
prepare the necessary sample ballots. Campaign consultants too
lobbied against the September date--they, after all, benefit from a
longer campaign season. Johnson first moved the date to August, but
the final bill, as amended in the Assembly, could return California
to its traditional date of the first week in June.</TE>
<TE>   California held its primary in June for half a century, and the
June to November time frame worked out fine. This year's March
primary, the earliest in the country, had the lowest turnout in state
history because many voters were not ready to vote.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to hold a March primary was made to enable California
to be a player in the presidential nominating process. California
thus became a victim of the senseless trend of the past 30 years--to
front-load the presidential nominating system. Once, the presidential
contest followed a logical calendar: Small states like New Hampshire
began the progression in March, then the presidential primaries moved
to the Midwestern and Southern states, and California finished the
season with its June presidential contest. The three-to-four-month
primary season was followed by the national conventions in midsummer,
but the last convention that was not a coronation occurred in 1976,
when Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford battled for the GOP nomination.
With meaningless conventions, the primaries have been so condensed as
to be a joke.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, California moved its June primary to March 26 in the hope
of affecting the presidential nominating decision. But South
Carolina's early March primary settled the GOP nomination for Kansas
Sen. Bob Dole, and President Clinton was unopposed. So, California
moved its 2000 primary to the first week in March. Once again, South
Carolina stole California's political thunder when it picked Texas
Gov. George W. Bush--in February. The Democratic contest never
developed.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats will set the ground rules for 2004, and they appear to
be making an even bigger mess of the presidential nominating process.
They have adopted a rule that would allow any state to hold its
presidential primary on Feb. 3, with Iowa and New Hampshire holding
their contests in January. California is still stuck with March, so,
once again, the state's hoped-for impact will go begging.</TE>
<TE>   This leaves California with two unpleasant choices: forget about
presidential politics or move its primary to Feb. 3. Everyone
concedes that a February primary for all other offices makes no sense
at all (in fact, it makes little sense for president, but that's up
to the national parties). California thus has no real alternative but
to spin off its presidential contest from the state's regular
primary, and that is the most important reform in Johnson's bill.
State Democrats have resisted this idea because it would create a
third election in presidential years, which might depress turnout.
But experience shows that leaving the primary in March isn't going to
boost turnout, either.</TE>
<TE>   There's a strong practical reason to hold a separate presidential
primary in California, and 2004 would be a good time to start. If
national candidates don't have to campaign in the West, political
money raised in California will simply go to enrich newspapers and
television stations in Iowa and New Hampshire. And Western concerns
such as water policy and Pacific Rim trade deserve an airing in the
presidential nominating campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the national parties will some day return to a more logical
calendar. But until that happens, we have no choice but to hold one
primary for president when the snow flies in the Sierra and one for
state offices in June or August.</TE>

<HD>New Legislation May Ease Housing Crisis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW SICHELMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>For the first time in recent memory, state and national housing
industry leaders are optimistic that they can begin to solve the
affordable-housing crisis.</LD>
<LD>   At the state level, California's builders are pinning their hopes
on legislation that would insulate them from lawsuits over
construction defects until they have time to investigate complaints
and make the necessary repairs.</LD>
<LD>   The measure is far from a done deal, but if it passes, Michael
Pattinson, president of the California Building Industry Assn., said
builders will once again enter the affordable townhouse and
condominium market and begin shoring up what has become a "chronic
housing deficit."</LD>
<TE>   At the national level, builders say there has been "more of a
focus" on housing problems in the last month than they've seen in
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm encouraged," said Gary Garczynski, president of the
210,000-member National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters at the Pacific Coast Builders Conference
here, Garczynski said the deepening chasm between America's haves and
have-nots "still has to be addressed."</TE>
<TE>   In a single week last month, the Bush administration released a
report outlining the barriers that prevent minorities from becoming
owners and then announced an unprecedented public-private commitment
to knock down those barriers.</TE>
<TE>   The president then visited the Department of Housing and Urban
Development and said, "I believe owning a home is an essential part
of economic security."</TE>
<TE>   The president's June housing blitz was timed to coincide with
National Homeownership Month.</TE>
<TE>   According to the California Building Industry Assn., the housing
shortfall in California will reach about 100,000 units this year,
meaning that builders will produce about 100,000 fewer units than
they could sell based on current demand.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the deficiency is in the affordable price
ranges, which builders have all but abandoned because of lawsuits,
Pattinson said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the mid-1980s, the San Diego builder charged, practically
every builder of every condo project built in the Golden State since
the mid-1980s has been sued over "real or alleged construction
defects." And as a result, the insurance industry has "basically
walked away from this part of our industry."</TE>
<TE>   But with legislation that would establish a builder's right to
repair problems, Pattinson, who heads Barratt American in Carlsbad,
said he's "more optimistic" than he's been in the last 10 years that
"at least a partial solution to the condo crisis is at hand."</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to define the difference between acceptable
construction tolerances and defects, the bill would prescribe a set
of "functionality standards" and guarantee that the home will meet
those requirements. It would also detail what's expected of buyers in
terms of maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   If something should go wrong, owners would be required to notify
their builders of the problems within a certain time frame. And
builders would then have so many days in which to investigate the
defect and make any repairs deemed necessary.</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides cannot agree on the problem and how to correct
it, they would submit their dispute to a third-party arbitrator.</TE>
<TE>   If litigation were to be curtailed in this manner, the builders'
association maintains, insurance would once again become available
and housing production would increase sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what the consumer wants," Pattinson said. "If he has a
problem, he wants it fixed. He doesn't want to be dragged into
litigation."</TE>
<TE>   The bill is similar to measures passed or under consideration in
Washington, Arizona, Virginia and a number of other states, according
to the National Assn. of Home Builders.</TE>
<TE>   California builders are on track to build nearly 150,000 new units
this year. That's about the same as the last two years, according to
the California Industry Research Board, but it's 100,000 short of
production levels in the mid-1980s.</TE>

<HD>Taking Back the Streets</HD>
<DH>A few years ago, residents of historic Alamitos Beach near
downtown Long Beach organized to clean up the decaying area. Now the
community is thriving.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN E. KLEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alamitos Beach, an oceanfront community of historic bungalows,
1920s-era four-plexes and '60s apartment buildings just east of
downtown Long Beach, is on the mend.</LD>
<LD>   Drive Bonito, Esperanza or Falcon avenues, and you'll find at
least one painting or remodeling project on every block. Neighbors
are out, sprucing up their gardens and sweeping their driveways.</LD>
<LD>   A few years ago, an Alamitos Beach renaissance was unimaginable.
With economic recession, military and hospital closures and aerospace
downsizing, Long Beach and its small, historic communities suffered
in the late '80s and early '90s.</LD>
<TE>   Property values declined and buildings went into foreclosure, then
languished in the hands of financial institutions that managed them
loosely from afar. Drug dealers, prostitutes, gang members and beach
bums quickly took advantage of low rents, and a series of
domestic-abuse-plagued flophouses sprang up as well as party houses
where residents would rent floor space at $5 a night to vagrants.</TE>
<TE>   This is the environment that Mike Wilson and his girlfriend,
Dionne Degenhardt, confronted in June 1998, when they pulled up to
their newly purchased, 14-room Spanish Colonial Revival at Bonito
Avenue and 1st Street.</TE>
<TE>   "We sat across the street, watching a really scary guy selling
crack right on the corner, and we were close to tears," Wilson said.
"We thought we'd just made a horrible, horrible mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Although they had looked at the home a couple of times before
buying, they hadn't realized how bad the neighborhood was until the
day they moved in. They had fallen in love with the historic home and
seen its potential as an investment because of the nearby beach.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Wilson and Degenhardt's duplex, Esser House, is a Long
Beach Historical Landmark. It was built in 1929 for $9,000. The
couple paid $240,000 for the 3,000-square-foot house (they rent out
one side and live in the other) with oak floors, a three-car garage,
a Spanish-tile fireplace and a view of the Queen Mary. They say it's
worth twice that much now.</TE>
<TE>   The ocean-breeze-cooled neighborhood is close to the revitalized
downtown Long Beach, and new resident Drake Cruz says he never
hesitates to walk to dinner or the local drugstore after dark.</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic change, residents say, is due to a determined group
of neighbors, led by Wilson and Degenhardt, and a cooperative and
proactive City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "We began to fight back, and we worked with the police to document
heroin sales and gang warfare," Wilson said. The Alamitos Beach
Neighborhood Assn., headed by longtime resident George Romo,
encouraged the passage of a nuisance-abatement ordinance that carried
a maximum $5,000 fine--enough to light a fire under absentee
landlords and get them to clean house.</TE>
<TE>   Residents like Wilson and Romo laugh when they hear that the top
complaints to police today are about skateboarders on the sidewalks
and noisy helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime is down by about 80% from what it was several years ago,"
said Rick McCabe, a legislative aide to Long Beach Vice Mayor Dan
Baker.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-block area bordered by Alamitos Avenue on the west, Cherry
Avenue on the east, 4th Street on the north and the Pacific Ocean has
had no murders or rapes reported during the past 18 months, according
to Long Beach Police Department statistics.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001 and the first quarter of 2002, there were eight robberies,
11 residential burglaries, 26 stolen cars and seven bicycle thefts.</TE>
<TE>   Residents are now concerned about parking, crumbling sidewalks and
high density, McCabe said, issues that reflect the neighborhood's
age.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury hotels and high-rise apartment buildings constructed along
Ocean Boulevard during the 1920s, like the elegantly restored
16-story Villa Riviera, included no parking facilities because they
were close to the Los Angeles Red Car line, which had a terminus in
Alamitos Beach. And zoning laws were lax in the 1950s and '60s when a
plethora of 20-unit apartment buildings was developed throughout the
area with only a carport or two required in back.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a parking nightmare, said Brent Heflin, broker-owner
of Brent Heflin Properties. "It's not unusual for people to drive
around for an hour looking for parking at certain high-impact times,"
he said. The city is working on reducing red curbs and converting
some blocks to slotted parking to try to lessen the crunch, McCabe
said.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of garages has not dampened the area's popularity,
however. "Property values have taken a big jump in the past year or
so," Heflin said. "Especially as potential buyers have been priced
out of [neighboring] Belmont Shore and Bluff Heights, they have been
pushed over to Alamitos Beach."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Long Beach was the last "affordable" oceanfront
community between Santa Barbara and San Diego, with bungalows just a
block or two off the water going for $200,000 or less. While Alamitos
Beach still offers the rare bargain, Long Beach has revitalized much
of its crumbling image in recent years, Heflin said, and prices have
gone up accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Single-family homes, which are scarce, tend to be 1920s and '30s
California bungalows that sell quickly. While you might still find a
two-bedroom, one-bath home in the high $200,000 range, Heflin said,
prices for the larger houses start at $350,000. Four-plexes, many of
which have been charmingly restored to their '20s-era glory, are also
in high demand by investors, who typically live in one unit and make
a tidy sum renting out the other three. Rents start at $900 for a
one-bedroom apartment--more if there's a parking space included.
Purchase prices start at $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Popular with the racially diverse population of mostly single,
under-40 professionals are condominiums--in new buildings going up
and recently completed on Ocean Boulevard, in buildings converted
from older hotels, motels and apartment houses, and in
"own-your-owns," which are apartment houses that have been turned
into tenant-owned cooperatives.</TE>
<TE>   When you buy an own-your-own, instead of getting a deed to your
unit as you would when buying a condominium, you purchase shares in
the cooperative. The legal distinction may seem arcane, but it has an
impact on financing, Heflin said, because financial institutions are
often reluctant to fund loans for cooperatives.</TE>
<TE>   In Alamitos Beach, however, own-your-owns are the most affordable
option. One-bedroom units, from 550 to 1,000 square feet, rent for
$650 to $1,100 a month in older buildings, and $1,500 in newer
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Singles or studios, depending on building and location, might rent
for as little as $495 to $850 a month, and you might find an
own-your-own for sale for around $50,000 for a single; $75,000 to
$115,000 for a one-bedroom; and $140,000 to $170,000 for a
two-bedroom. Own-your-owns on the beach would sell for $200,000 to
$350,000.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury condominiums in beachfront high-rises sell for $600,000 and
up, and might rent for $2,000 a month if they have an ocean view. A
one-bedroom, one-bath condo in an older building might sell for as
little as $90,000, but could go up to $350,000 in a newer building.
Two-bedroom, two-bath condo units of 1,200 square feet rent for from
$800 to $1,500 a month and might sell for $250,000 to $395,000.</TE>
<TE>   Romo, the neighborhood association president, moved to Alamitos
Beach in 1985 from Huntington Beach and purchased an own-your-own in
the 17-unit Anita Imperial, built as an apartment complex in the
1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "We converted to a condominium association in the early 1990s,"
Romo said. He paid $83,500 for the two-bedroom, 1 3/4-bath,
1,200-square-foot unit three blocks from Ocean Boulevard. He
estimates the value now at $225,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this area because of the diversity of the population, and
because it's so close to the ocean," Romo said. "I knew when I moved
in that it would be a valuable property someday."</TE>
<TE>   New resident Cruz's condo, with two bedrooms, two baths and a
loft, which he purchased in November, has already gone up in value.
He bought the 1,200-square-foot unit, in a building three blocks from
the beach, for $189,000 and has already been offered $230,000 for it,
though it's not for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I love that the place is within walking distance to just about
everything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The area offers many amenities: Bixby Park is on Cherry Avenue,
and there are several nearby museums, including the Long Beach Museum
of Art and the Museum of Latin American Art. The Aquarium of the
Pacific and the Queen Mary are close, and in the works are some new
oceanfront developments, including the Long Beach Pike, that are
easily accessible via a free shuttle bus that runs along Ocean
Boulevard. (For $1 you can ride down to Belmont Shore and Naples.)
From the Metro Blue Line station on Pine Avenue in nearby downtown,
$2.75 gets you a round-trip ticket to Union Station in downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the best amenity, residents say, is the sense of friendship
and community that was born out of the fight to save their
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Having a strong group of neighbors that banded together to
upgrade our homes and kick out the riffraff really bonded us," Wilson
said. "We're a tightknit group now."</TE>

<TE>   History: John W. Bixby laid out the Alamitos Beach Townsite and
Bay Harbor in 1886. It originally encompassed a larger area,
stretching from Alamitos to Termino, and from the Pacific Ocean to
10th Street. The Bixby family of Maine purchased Rancho Los Alamitos,
covering much of present-day Long Beach and Los Alamitos, beginning
in 1866 and turned it into a sheep ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Bixby had ambitious plans for the community, envisioning a
deep-water harbor and railroad terminus, but he died in 1887, leaving
the development's completion to his cousins. An economic downturn
meant a slow start for sales in the Alamitos Land Co., but home and
farm sites began selling after the turn of the century. At that time,
a bitter fight ensued over whether Alamitos Beach would remain an
independent city or become a part of Long Beach. Several efforts to
annex Alamitos Beach failed between 1905 and 1909 before the area
finally became part of Long Beach on Nov. 30, 1909.</TE>
<TE>   Schools:  Alamitos Beach is part of the Long Beach Unified School
District, which operates 91 schools for 83,500 students. The
district's students are 47% Latino, 20% African American, 17% white,
11% Asian, 3% Filipino, 2% Pacific Islander.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Elementary School, 1620 Temple Ave., serves some Alamitos
Beach students from kindergarten through fifth grade. Its score on
the 2001 Academic Performance Index, based on test scores, was 3 out
of a possible 10, but compared with California schools with similar
demographic and economic profiles, Lee Elementary scored an 8 out of
10. Teachers at Lee have an average eight years of experience,
compared with the state average of 13 years, and 56% of Lee teachers
have a full credential, compared with the state average of 86%.</TE>
<TE>   Stevenson Elementary, 515 Lime Ave., also serves area elementary
students. Its 2001 API score was 3 out of 10, but it scored 10 out of
10 compared to similar schools. Teachers are less experienced than
average, with an average of eight years in the classroom, and 52%
have full credentials. Stevenson also lags in technology, with 17
students per computer, compared with a statewide average of 6.7.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin Middle School, 540 Cerritos Ave., serves sixth- through
eighth-graders and has a 2001 API Index of 1 out of 10. It ranks 6
out of 10 compared to schools with similar demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Along with less-experienced teachers--nine years' experience on
average and 65% with a full credential--Franklin has 14 students per
computer.</TE>
<TE>   Polytechnic High School, 1600 Atlantic Ave., serves grades nine
through 12 and has a 6 out of 10 API score, and 10 out of 10 when
compared to similar schools. Slightly fewer than half of Polytechnic
students (45%) take the Scholastic Achievement Test in preparation
for college admissions. The school's average SAT scores are 484
verbal and 516 math.</TE>

<HD>Tenant Faces Eviction as Landlord's Son Gets Set to Move In</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN POSTEMA</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have lived for 24 years in a rent-controlled apartment in
Los Angeles. The landlord has asked me to move out of the apartment
so that his son may move in. If the son lives there for less than one
year, can I sue the landlord for a bad-faith eviction? If the son
moves out after one year, is the apartment vacancy decontrolled, or
would the new tenant pay the same rent as I paid?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The apartment is not vacancy decontrolled after the son
moves out, regardless of how long he stays. However, the new tenant
will pay the amount of rent that you paid, plus any annual or other
allowed rent increases. Annual rent increases under Los Angeles rent
control are 3% per year.</LD>
<LD>   Under state law (Civil Code section 1947.10, which applies only to
rent-controlled cities), the owner or owner's relative must live in
the apartment for at least six months after an eviction. If the son
doesn't live in the apartment for the six-month minimum, a court must
determine that the eviction was based upon fraud before it penalizes
the owner.</LD>
<TE>   Penalties are fairly severe but there are exceptions. For
instance, if the son moved into the apartment and then after three
months his employer transferred him out of state, causing the son to
move before the required six months, it is unlikely the court would
find that the owner engaged in a fraudulent eviction.</TE>
<TE>   Loss of Off-Street Parking  Requires Compensation</TE>
<TE>   Q: Last year my wife and I bought an eight-unit (four two-bedroom
units and four one-bedroom units) rent-controlled apartment building
in Los Angeles. It was fully occupied when we bought it so we
inherited the tenants and their rental agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The rental agreements do not reference off-street parking so any
understandings the tenants had with the former owners must have been
verbal.</TE>
<TE>   Now we've had vacancies and we've re-rented those units. The
problem is that there are only six parking spaces for this eight-unit
building. As a result, some of the new tenants who live in the
higher-rent two-bedroom apartments do not have off-street parking.</TE>
<TE>   Can we reassign parking to those tenants who should have it by
virtue of the higher rent they pay?</TE>
<TE>   A: You can reassign the parking spaces at your building, but you
will have to compensate tenants for the loss of this service. The
rent-control law requires you to compensate tenants for any losses of
services that are included with their rentals. These services do not
have to be written into their rental agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that these "understandings" the tenants had with the
former owners were verbal does not make them unenforceable. They are
enforceable verbal agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The law says, "Whenever there is a reduction in housing services
which are defined in the LAMC 151.02.F, there must be a corresponding
decrease in rent equal to the reduction in the monthly cost to the
landlord of the service, divided by the number of units deprived of
that service. In those cases where the monthly cost to the landlord
is not readily available, the decrease in rent shall be equal to the
reduction in market value of the service."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, under the L.A. rent law, you must reduce the rent
by the precise value of the service being eliminated or reduced. If
the value of parking in your neighborhood is $100 per month, you must
reduce a tenant's rent by $100 per month if you take away his
parking.</TE>
<TE>   Landlord Can Assess $7 Surcharge--Only in June</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am told that the owner of our West Los Angeles apartment
building is going to tack $7 onto our July rent. He says he is
entitled to a $7 refund from his tenants because he participates in
rent control.</TE>
<TE>   The other tenants got letters informing them of this. I did not.
Can he do this?</TE>
<TE>   A: Assuming that you are asking if the landlord can assess the
tenants a one-time $7 fee, the answer is yes, but only if he meets
certain conditions.</TE>
<TE>   The landlord pays to the city's Rent Stabilization Division an
annual $14-per-unit registration fee for the administration of rent
control.</TE>
<TE>   He is entitled to recover half of the fee, $7, from the tenants
through a one-time annual surcharge to the tenants, but there are
specific procedures the landlord must follow.</TE>
<TE>   First, a landlord must give a tenant a 30-day notice of the annual
rent surcharge. Second, and most important to your situation, the
landlord must collect the surcharge during June. The law does not
allow for collection during any other month of the year, which
includes July.</TE>
<TE>   Your landlord is tardy if he is trying to collect the surcharge in
July.</TE>

<LD>This 7.7-acre estate in the heart of Montecito's Golden Quadrangle
was built on the former grounds of the Pillsbury estate, owned by the
Pillsbury milling family that was based in the Midwest.</LD>
<LD>   After acquiring the property in the 1980s, the current owners, an
L.A. businessman and his wife, had the Pillsbury home, built in the
late 1800s, torn down.</LD>
<LD>   The couple hired L.A. designer Michael Smith to create this
estate, which was completed in 1997. Now Smith is designing another
estate for the couple on a property they purchased in Malibu.</LD>
<TE>   About this house: The Portuguese-style manor home also has a
two-bedroom, two-bathroom guest house, a carriage house, pool house
and tennis viewing pavilion.</TE>

<LD>Rock star Eddie Van Halen and his wife, actress Valerie Bertinelli,
have purchased a Hollywood Hills home for close to its $2.25-million
asking price.</LD>
<LD>   The traditional-style home has five bedrooms and six bathrooms in
5,200 square feet. Built in 1948 but recently remodeled, the home is
on a promontory of about an acre. The house is behind gates with city
views and rolling lawns, where Van Halen, an avid golfer, can
practice his swing.</LD>
<LD>   The house also has vaulted ceilings, two wood-burning fireplaces,
a media and family room, a master suite with walk-in closets and a
separate bedroom wing off the family room.</LD>
<TE>   The couple, in their 40s, were living in a smaller home in the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Van Halen, lead guitarist for the band Van Halen, and Bertinelli
have been married since 1981. He composed the theme music for the
1990 sitcom "Sydney," in which she starred. Van Halen has been
described as "one of the most revolutionary guitarists in rock
music."</TE>
<TE>   The band was originally formed by Van Halen and his drummer
brother, Alex. With singer David Lee Roth and bassist Michael
Anthony, they released their debut album in 1978 with the single "You
Really Got Me." The album sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Eddie Van Halen announced that he had tongue cancer,
but in May he said that he had conquered it. He also had
hip-replacement surgery in 1999. His health has been cited as a
reason the band has not toured or released new material in four
years.</TE>
<TE>   Bertinelli, who first gained attention as the younger daughter of
a divorced mother on the CBS sitcom "One Day at a Time" (1975-84),
joined the cast of the CBS series "Touched by an Angel" in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Jana Jones-Duffy and Fred Holley of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills
South, shared the listing with Lee Walters of Leland Properties,
Studio City, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Portia de Rossi, who played lawyer Nelle Porter in the Fox series
"Ally McBeal," and her companion, singer-musician Francesca
Gregorini, daughter of actress Barbara Bach and stepdaughter of
former Beatle Ringo Starr, have purchased a home in the Los Feliz
area for $2.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after it was built in the '20s, the Spanish villa was the
home of Raymond Griffith, a silent-screen star who quit acting after
he appeared in the 1930 talkie "All Quiet on the Western Front." He
then entered the production side of the business and was associate
producer of the movie "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" (1938), starring
Shirley Temple.</TE>
<TE>   The home, behind gates with city views, has five bedrooms, 4 1/2
bathrooms and a library-den in about 3,700 square feet. There are
also three fireplaces in the house and such '20s design touches as
Malibu tiles, stenciled beams and vintage fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   The house was updated to include a granite kitchen, a new roof,
new plumbing, seismic retrofitting and electronic wiring.</TE>
<TE>   The half-acre grounds have a deep lap pool, cutting and vegetable
gardens, a flat lawn and specimen trees.</TE>
<TE>   Rossi, 29, had been living in a Hollywood penthouse that she
listed in May at just less than $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actress, who will be seen in Clint Eastwood's upcoming movie
"Blood Work," and Gregorini bought their new home from film producers
Patrick Crowley and Cathleen Summers, who moved to a home they bought
several months ago in Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   Crowley is producer of the recently released movie "The Bourne
Identity," starring Matt Damon, and he was executive producer of
"Sleepless in Seattle" (1993). Summers was executive producer of
"Slow Burn" (2000), starring Minnie Driver and Josh Brolin, and she
produced "Stakeout" (1987), starring Richard Dreyfuss.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Stanley of Coldwell Banker, Los Feliz North, had the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sinatra Jr., who will perform Aug. 15-21 at the MGM Grand in
Las Vegas--where he appeared earlier this year in a tribute to his
late father--has purchased a Beverly Hills-area home for just under
$1.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   He recently sold a nearby home, which he refurbished, for $2.9
million.</TE>
<TE>   The traditional-style home that the singer-orchestra leader, 58,
purchased has five bedrooms and 3 1/2 bathrooms in about 3,400 square
feet. The master suite has a deck and a fireplace. There are four
fireplaces in the house.</TE>
<TE>   The home also has a playhouse, private yard and pool. Built in
1977, the home was updated by its sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Arleen Ruby and Lawrence Leviton of the Ruby Leviton Team at
Prudential California Realty, John Aaroe Division in Beverly Hills,
had the listing on the house Sinatra bought; Michele Martin of DBL
Beverly Hills represented him in his sale and purchase, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Scheer Demme, widow of the late director Ted Demme, has
purchased a one-story, mid-century modern home in the Sunset Strip
hills for $2 million. She also has an apartment in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Demme, nephew of director Jonathan Demme, was an award-winning TV
director and producer when he died of a heart attack in January at
age 37. Ted Demme also directed the movies "Blow" (2001) and
"Beautiful Girls" (1996).</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Demme, a music supervisor on "Blow," and her husband had
been renting in the L.A. area for a couple of years. The house she
purchased has four bedrooms and four bathrooms in about 3,000 square
feet. Her new home is on half an acre with city-to-ocean views.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Peele of Sotheby's International Realty, Beverly Hills, had
the listing, and Brett Lawyer of Prudential California Realty,
Beverly Hills, represented Amanda Demme in buying, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Composer-arranger Roger Neill, who wrote the music for the NBC
series "UC: Undercover" and the Fox animated series "King of the
Hill" as well as the CBS series "Chicago Hope," and his attorney
wife, Lisa Sergi, have sold their country English duplex in Los Feliz
and purchased a Spanish-style villa in the same area.</TE>
<TE>   They sold the duplex, which was listed at $795,000, for $925,500,
and they bought the five-bedroom house for its $844,000 asking price.
The couple had restored the duplex, built in 1937, with Art Deco tile
work, carved doors and leaded-glass windows.</TE>
<TE>   They also plan to restore the Mexican-hacienda home they just
bought. Built in 1940, it has a pool, a pool cabana with a fireplace
and dressing rooms, and city views.</TE>
<TE>   Neill co-wrote scores for the movies "Trixie" (2000), starring
Emily Watson and Nick Nolte, and "Where the Money Is" (1999),
starring Paul Newman and Linda Fiorentino.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Chimienti, estates director of DBL Beverly Hills, represented
the couple in selling and buying. Rosemary Low, director of estates
for DBL Los Feliz, co-listed the duplex and represented the buyer as
well as the sellers.</TE>

<HD>Architect's Value Includes Cost Control</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I disagree with "When Choosing an Architect, Nail Down All the Fees
First" (June 16), by Katherine Salant.</LD>
<LD>   As a registered architect with more than 20 years' experience in
high-end residential homes and remodeling projects, the architect
fees are the least a client should worry about. In negotiating to
reduce a qualified architect's fee, the client is essentially
removing a most valuable experience resource from a process where it
is most needed.</LD>
<LD>   Architects are not just used for design and aesthetic
considerations. We excel in contract management, guided by forms and
agreements from the American Institute of Architects, which clearly
stipulate contract tasks and project responsibilities.</LD>
<TE>   Every construction project represents a difficult task to master.
From the first meeting to the turnkey completion, this process
requires extensive know-how, specific knowledge, able negotiation
skills and certain ubiquitous "people application" skills.</TE>
<TE>   Even the simple definition of the "scope of work" demands a keen
understanding of what an estimated budget and project should
describe.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly all the clients I've been associated with had a fixed
budget in mind, as well as a pretty good idea about what they'd like
to see in a completed construction project. Unfortunately, these two
concepts are at odds with each other. The project always costs more
to build, is always more complex and is never exactly like the
original vision we first started out with.</TE>
<TE>   Terms such as "cost definition" and "work scope" are often the
main cause of communication breakdown between client, contract and
architect. Everything in construction is cost-related, so the client
should not skimp on fees for the person most in control of those
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Limiting architectural contracts to keep the design fees low is
doing a disservice to clients' ability to "engage in saving money."
You should pay your architect more to ensure that your construction
costs remain within certain specifications.</TE>

<LD>"When in Doubt, Disclose" by Allison B. Cohen (June 23) is very good
advice. For me, it's about 20 years too late.</LD>
<LD>   I purchased my home in 1981, four years before the disclosure law.
Ten years after I purchased the house, it settled 3 inches on one
side. I repaired it at a cost of $30,000.</LD>
<LD>   During the restoration, we found a 6-inch oil company line with
the house foundation poured over it. The house was restored to tiptop
condition. Ten years later the house raised several inches on the
opposite side, directly over the pipe again.</LD>
<TE>   The article should have said this: If the seller discloses
anything relating to structural irregularities, walk away.</TE>
<TE>   The only compensation I have received is that I had my property
tax reduced 50%.</TE>
<TE>   It's a crying shame that those who are responsible for structural
failure, either installation or inspection, are beyond reach unless
you have a hefty bank account.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Upside and Downside of YSPs" (June 16), Jack Guttentag examines
yield spread premiums and the risks posed in adopting proposals that
limit their responsible use.</LD>
<LD>   Guttentag is right on the mark in cautioning regulators of the
risk of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater" when YSPs can be
used to benefit the consumer. The purpose of YSPs is not to deliver
"high cost" loans by mortgage brokers. Used as a means to decrease
closing costs, YSPs can be beneficial to borrowers with little cash
to obtain no-cost mortgages or represent an alternative for those
willing to pay a higher rate to reduce upfront fees. In many case,
YSPs make the difference between closing a sale and being denied a
loan.</LD>
<LD>   As the author states, disclosure is the remedy to unfair
practices. In fact, members of the California Assn. of Mortgage
Brokers are already remedying the problem by committing to upfront
practices by disclosing their compensation, in writing, before
submitting an application to a lender. Member brokers are committed
to conducting their business activities in a professional manner--a
sure-fire recipe for putting an end to deceptive practices.</LD>

<HD>Low Interest Rates Fuel Home-Loan Surge</HD>
<DH>The steady decline brings a boom in refinancing at the end
of June, and draws even the most timid buyers into the housing
market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The steady decline in mortgage interest rates to among the lowest in
30 years has created a surge of home mortgage lending and
refinancing, and nudged even the most reluctant home buyers to take
the plunge into the housing market.</LD>
<LD>   Lenders nationwide and locally reported a burst of refinancing
applications the last week of June, including borrowers who
refinanced just six months ago.</LD>
<LD>   "This [refinancing] boom has far outlasted anyone's predictions,"
said Marc Piscitelli, regional vice president of Wells Fargo Home
Loan Mortgage. "I've not seen a boom like this in my 22 years in the
business."</LD>
<TE>   The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage with one point in
Southern California was 6.15% last week, down from 7.14% a year ago,
according to Earl Peattie, vice president of National Financial News
Services.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year low of 6.12% was posted in November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are down in the stock market and that has a reverse impact
on securities and mortgage rates," Peattie said. "This is the time to
get qualified and check into refinancing and lock in a rate as soon
as possible. I don't think it can get much lower."</TE>
<TE>   Market analysts agree. Doug Duncan, chief economist for the
Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America, said he doesn't expect rates to
drop below 6.25% nationwide, unless investor confidence continues to
erode. The MBAA's average mortgage interest rate forecast of 7% for
2002 probably is slightly higher than the actual average for this
year, Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   The association is predicting a 7.4% average for 2003. The
surprisingly long period of low interest rates has spurred even the
most timid buyers into the home loan market, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and Orange counties, for example, Wells Fargo Home
Mortgage funded $541 million in total loans in May, with refinancings
representing about 51% of that loan volume.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, the lender funded $461 million in total loans in the
two counties, with refinances making up about 62% of those loans,
said Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   At Countrywide Home Loans, total loan fundings were $13.7 billion
in May, up 26% over the same period a year ago, according to the
company's monthly report of operating statistics.</TE>
<TE>   Refinancings made up about 42% of the total.</TE>
<TE>   "This is completely unexpected," said Doug Perry, first vice
president of Countrywide. "At the beginning of the year, we never
thought we'd have such a competitive interest-rate environment."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, total mortgage loan applications the last week of June
increased 24.8% from the previous week, according to the MBAA.</TE>
<TE>   Refinancing applications represented 50% of the total, up from
43.6% the previous week. The average loan size was $206,500, the
largest on record.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't get much better than this for interest rates on
any loan type, whether fixed or adjustable," the MBAA's Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers who prefer adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, when
interest rates are higher, are less interested now, analysts say.
ARMs represent about 27% of the current mortgage market in Orange
County, for example, compared with a peak of 77.4% in 1988, according
to DataQuick Information Systems.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agents say that first-time buyers, especially, are
benefiting from the low rates. More savvy than buyers were a decade
ago, today's home seekers know that lower interest rates allow them
to get more home for the dollar, said Judy Graff, a Re/Max Elite
agent in Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   "Lower rates are keeping first-time buyers in the market, even
when they have to make five offers before getting accepted," Graff
said. "They're staying in the game, rather than being scared off, as
they would have in previous years."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, when rates hovered around 6.75%, a borrower would
have locked into monthly payments of $1,622 on a 30-year, fixed-rate
loan of $250,000, said Kris Yamamoto, a Countrywide spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   At today's rate of about 6.25%, the monthly payment on the same
loan would be $1,539, a savings of nearly $10,000 over 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Altay Ovunc, 36, a Glendale marketing manager, has decided to keep
looking for a house in the Franklin Hills area of Los Angeles,
despite the fierce competition from others vying for the few homes
available in the higher-priced area.</TE>
<TE>   The first-time buyer lost out on his dream house there recently,
following a heated bidding war in which he agreed to a counteroffer
of $21,000 over the asking price. He is, nonetheless, determined to
hang in there.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still in the market, primarily because of the phenomenal
interest rates," Ovunc said. "If I wait, the rates may go up, and the
home prices too. It's better to stay in."</TE>

<HD>Lender Guidelines May Help You Pinpoint the Predators</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the July 1 implementation of AB 489, a California law
prohibiting predatory lending practices, the California Assn. of
Mortgage Brokers has issued these guidelines to help consumers
identify unscrupulous lenders:</LD>
<LD>   * Never sign a contract without knowing and understanding all
terms of the loan. Originators should be willing to explain all loan
terms and conditions.</LD>
<LD>   * Never allow yourself to be pressured into a loan. Reputable
mortgage originators strive to make consumers aware of and
comfortable with their options.</LD>
<TE>   * Beware of door-to-door and telephone solicitations.</TE>
<TE>   * Never sign a blank form in a loan package and be sure to get
copies of all documents bearing your signature.</TE>
<TE>   * Request an accounting of all fees associated with the
transaction. Question any fees you do not understand.</TE>
<TE>   * Shop around for a loan originator that you are comfortable with.
CAMB offers referral services at www.cambweb.org or by phone at (800)
253-2262.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure that you can afford the proposed monthly payments. Do
not agree to payments that you cannot comfortably make.</TE>
<TE>   * You have three days to cancel a refinance transaction for any
reason if you are unhappy with the loan. This is called the three-day
"Right of Rescission."</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure the loan officer is licensed to originate mortgage
loans.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Now is a good time to prepare to beat the heat and high energy bills
by purchasing a new air-conditioning system.</LD>
<LD>   Today's high-efficiency models with a federal "energy-star"
designation use half the energy a 20-year-old model uses. During peak
cooling periods, you can cut overall energy bills by 20% to 40%.</LD>
<LD>   Units that are 10 years old or older have seasonal energy
efficiency ratings of only 6 to 8. New units are rated 12 or
greater--a big difference that leads to big savings. Another bonus:
Many utilities offer rebates on these units.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Invited to: "Target a Time for Heroes," a celebrity carnival to
benefit the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, at a private
residence in Mandeville Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   Kid friendly, star-mom approved: "I do a lot of fund-raisers for a lot
of causes, but this is the one I can actually bring my kids to," says
Christine Lahti, actress, director and mother of three. "They like it
because there's no rubber chicken." Ah, but there is. The rubber chicken
presence is scarce, granted, at the multifarious buffets (everyone from
Campanile to Pink's representing), but Jennifer Love Hewitt is holding an
armload at one of the carny game booths. "It's called 'Flip-A-Chick,' "
she explains, while helping a line of kids catapult said rubber poultry
into a hole. Shuttle bus upon shuttle bus discharge more than 1,500
guests (the "Heroes" of the party's title) onto the ample grounds at
$1,000 a head, $250 for kids--a cool $2 million for the cause once you
factor in corporate underwriting. And thanks to liberal game rules, prize
tickets are easy to come by, so many of the small fry (and more than a
few not-such-spring-chickens) are happily lugging oversized FAO Schwartz
bags by the time they leave.</LD>
<TE>   Where the wild things are: "The fact that they're bringing a whole
ramp onto a private-residence tennis court is amazing," says Tony Hawk,
presiding over the party's extreme skateboard/inline/BMX zone. As the
star of his own video game, the pro skateboarder and his corkscrew
maneuvers generate more excitement with the junior contingent than
Hollywood's top movie draws, many of whom put in a shift at the story
tent. "A Beautiful Mind's" Jennifer Connelly reads from "The Lorax," and
sometime starship captain Patrick Stewart reads from "Click Clack Moo:
Cows That Type." A newly orthodontured Tom Cruise tries to hold the
kiddies rapt with readings from "Where the Wild Things Are" and "And to
Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street," while that other Cruz
--Penelope--looks on. "I'm losing my audience," he mock-frets, though,
needless to say, the adult children (media included) hang onto every
word. "Has he left the premises? Beat it, Cruise," cracks "Everybody
Loves Raymond" star Ray Romano, next in the storyteller's chair with
on-screen wife Patricia Heaton. They will endeavor to captivate the
children with the tale of "Rosie and Roger" once the Tom-and-Penelope
hubbub subsides.</TE>

<LD>The summer blockbusters are upon us, along with the inevitable
hang-wringing over the global reach of movie franchising. But amid all
the sequels, video games and action figures, yet another marketing
behemoth is uncoiling its tentacles in Los Angeles: the magazine tie-in.
If these magazine-owned or -licensed stores are any evidence, we can rest
assured that the publishing world is bravely doing its part to erase the
line between editorial content and merchandise.</LD>
<LD>   Once rife with carefully coordinated outfits and earnest essays on
popularity, seventeen magazine may still speak for the all-American
teenage girl--but today's girl dyes her hair platinum and reads articles
titled "Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Roll: We find out why so many teens get
wasted before getting it on." Tinseltown's spanking-new commercial mecca
at the Hollywood &amp; Highland complex includes a boutique that uses the
popular monthly's name under a licensing agreement. Adjacent to the
under-21 dance club 17 (pronounced "one-seven"), Seventeen offers trendy
Britney Spears-style threads from labels such as Frankie B. and Michael
Stars. Unfortunately, not many underagers (except Britney herself) can
afford them. Prices range from $28 for a T-shirt to $120 for jeans to
$200 for fancy tops and jackets. Seventeen/6801 Hollywood Blvd., 3rd
floor, #361; (323) 461-8417</LD>
<TE>   Devoted to "Asian Pop Culture and Beyond," 8-year-old indie publishing
phenom giant robot has evolved from homemade 'zine to glossy magazine and
still operates out of founder Eric Nakamura's West L.A. garage. Giant
Robot investigates topics such as Japanese animation, Hong Kong martial
arts films and "the return of Cambodian psychedelic rock." Its cozy shop
opened in October 2001 and carries comics, toys and books from Japan and
China, as well as the magazine's own line of T-shirts. Hot sellers
include the psychedelic Hello Kitty-like character "afro ken" (a cute
little dog with a puffy hairdo) on stickers and stationery. Giant
Robot/2015 Sawtelle Blvd.; (310) 478-1819</TE>
<TE>   Sure, vice magazine features articles such as "Dirty Deeds: Black
Market Nuclear Bombs Are Dirt Cheap," but it's hard to escape the feeling
that the merchandise is the message here. The Web site of the VICE
"empire" says the free monthly is for "tastemakers (like us) who indulge
in everything from hip hop and punk to skateboarding and fashion as well
as scatology and sexual perversities" and crows that "by offering the
magazine for free at key music, fashion and leisure locations, the
magazine enjoys a 100% pick-up rate and massive public response."
Unsurprisingly, said "key" locations include VICE boutiques in New York,
Toronto, London and Montreal (the magazine's home base), along with an
industrial-looking space that opened last August in L.A.'s Silver Lake
neighborhood. The store features edgy urban wear for men and women from
Canada, Sweden, England, Paris, Spain and Australia. The clothing--from
Miss Sixty's punky tops to Adidas' limited-edition track suit and sneaker
reissues--embodies the magazine's hip street flair. Vice/3938 Sunset
Blvd.; (323) 661-2741</TE>
<TE>   Imagine a naughty Starbucks, and you'll get a feel for hustler
hollywood. Like Larry Flynt's adult magazine, this colorful, Flynt-owned
Sunset Strip emporium is unabashedly sexy, glorying in risque novelties,
videos and clothes. Still, its bright and cheery atmosphere (there's a
general-interest magazine stand, coffee bar and rock 'n'
roll-meets-hot-rodder-style boutique clothing for sale) actually makes
the provocative merchandise seem kind of tame. You're more likely to see
rockers, clubgoers and middle-aged tourists in the aisles than seedy
types in trench coats. Hustler Hollywood/8920 W. Sunset Blvd.; (310)
860-9009.</TE>

<LD>Nobody turns down the manager at Yang Chow. William Sung once asked
a U.S. Secret Service agent for his business card. "He gave it to me,"
Sung said. "I told him, 'You're no longer secret.' " In 22 years at the
popular Chinatown restaurant and downtown institution, Sung has amassed a
business card collection numbering in the thousands and organized in
binders with loose subcategories.</LD>
<LD>   One huge binder is filled with cards from hundreds of local court
officials (judges, defense lawyers, prosecutors, etc.), including nearly
every major player from the O.J. Simpson case. "I got one from Judge
Ito--the real one, not the dancing one," says Sung, who also seems to
collect one-liners. "I got them all except Mark Fuhrman and Marcia Clark.
She was very busy with her hairstyle."</LD>
<LD>   Another section could be headed "Feds," mingling cards from officials
with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Justice Department, FBI,
Immigration and Naturalization Service and the IRS. Sung is particularly
fond of cards that display realistic imitations of metal badges. On the
local level, Sung has the cards of hundreds of police officers from
cities across the country as well as those of many politicians, including
Mayor James Hahn's old city attorney card.</LD>
<TE>   Cards from major entertainment executives fill several pages of one
binder; the collection also features unusual job titles such as
"Terrorism Expert" or "Serious Fraud Officer," and cards from major local
sports franchises (Lakers, Clippers, Dodgers and more). Sung has Magic
Johnson's business card and one from someone named Larry Bird--but it's
not the former basketball legend. "He's says he's Larry Bird, but he's
shorter than me," Sung says.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to explain his unusual collection, Sung, 53, lays his cards on
the table. "I tried to remember some of the customers," he says. "I
started asking for business cards and they'd send more." He also collects
autographed photos from celebrities, among them Sidney Poitier and Diane
Keaton. "Sometimes they don't have business cards," he says. "I'm still
waiting on Sharon Stone's autograph." The celebrity collection includes a
photo of Sung standing next to actor Don Johnson. "He and Magic are not
related," he deadpans.</TE>

<HD>High on Chicano Art</HD>
<DH>Cheech Marin's Collection is Wowing 'Em at the Smithsonian</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABEL SALAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a guy who spent much of his career "up in smoke" as half of the
counterculture comedy duo Cheech and Chong, Cheech Marin makes a
convincing fine-art connoisseur. In the last 20 years, the goofball
pothead foil of out-of-his-gourd Tommy Chong has amassed a personal stash
of Chicano art that is now in an exhibition at the Smithsonian
Institution.</LD>
<LD>   Disparaging remarks from a grade school teacher on his first stick
figure drawings did not inhibit Marin's love for art, he says, but rather
intensified his need to surround himself with it. Growing up as a
third-generation Angeleno in the late '50s and early '60s, Marin devoured
art books with a vengeance. By junior high, he was "conversant in world
art," able to "tell a Rembrandt from a Renoir, a Monet from a Manet."
Years later, encouraged by his wife, painter Patti Heid, he gained
familiarity with contemporary art through visits to Santa Monica
galleries. In the early '80s, Marin noticed that Chicano art was
attracting an audience in the larger L.A. scene, and the Chicano punk
movement added an avant-garde mystique. Marin bought his first painting
in 1982, moved by work that represented his community and culture with a
vibrant, contemporary palette.</LD>
<TE>   "It resonated with me both on a very personal level because I
identified with the imagery and subject matter, and on a world art
level," Cheech says of his affinity for the sophisticated work of artists
such as Frank Romero, Gronk, Carlos Almaraz, George Yepes and Carmen
Lomas Garza.</TE>
<TE>   Awarded a Grammy for Best Comedy Album with Chong in 1973, Marin went
solo in 1986 and has credits including "Tin Cup" and "Spy Kids," the
latter a film by Robert Rodriguez. His PCH home north of Malibu is
outfitted with terrazzo tile and wall-sized windows that open toward the
sunset. The walls under a loft-high, exposed-beam ceiling are riddled
with color and texture. A rare Gronk pastel, a Romero neon back-lit
painting on wood and a lush Yepes Madonna animate Marin's conversation as
much as the coffee he shares with his guests.</TE>
<TE>   Billed by curator Rene Yanez as the most comprehensive showing of
Chicano art yet mounted, "Chicano Visions: American Painters on the
Verge" draws heavily from Marin's private collection. In all, 82 pieces
by 26 artists--65 from Marin's collection of about 150 works--will tour
15 cities in five years. "It's where traditional Mexican met urban
angst," says Marin. "Where those two edges coincided, they blurred into
what we know as Chicano art and sensibility."</TE>
<TE>   While some activists have bristled at the inclusion of work devoid of
the political content sometimes deemed a requirement of "Chicano art,"
Marin remains ecstatic at the response to the show and plans to publish a
coffee table catalogue this fall. "You make it cool enough that everybody
wants to be there, in order to change the charge on that word and
reinterpret it as a term of pride and integrity."--abel salas</TE>

<HD>Truth and Consequences on the Reservation</HD>
<DH>Elouise Cobell Heard the Stories for Years: The U.S. Government Was
Cheating Native Americans on Payments for Land Rights. She Took Up the
Cause, and Now the Blackfoot Indian Tribe and Others Are Poised to Reap
Billions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. MICHAEL KENNEDY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Blackfoot country, passing down stories from one generation to
the next is an intricate part of tribal culture. The people who live here
at the foot of the Montana Rockies pride themselves on the accuracy of
this oral tradition. In the spring, when the geese have returned and the
first rumble of thunder has rolled over the land, the Blackfeet begin a
series of sacred ceremonies in which the stories they tell must never be
embroidered, lest they be colored over time. Truth, they say, is the core
of their history.</LD>
<LD>   On the days when Elouise Cobell drives to the dilapidated Blackfoot
reservation town of Browning, she passes a weathered historical marker
that tells part of a story. The wooden sign marks the site of the U.S.
government's first Indian office for the Blackfoot Nation. The marker
also describes the devastating winter of 1884, when more than 500
Blackfeet died of starvation on the treeless, wind-swept plains where the
government buildings once stood.</LD>
<LD>   That account bears little resemblance to the Indian version of this
grim tale, which has it that the U.S. Indian agent, John Young, hoarded
food that would have saved the Blackfeet. The Indians who perished were
buried in a mass grave atop what the Blackfeet reverently call Ghost
Ridge. Cobell can see the ridge, too, each time she makes the 30-mile
trip into Browning from her modest ranch south of town.</LD>
<TE>   Cobell is a Blackfoot who for nearly three decades has overseen the
financial fortunes of</TE>
<TE>   her people, once a feared warrior tribe that roamed the plains before
starvation, disease and</TE>
<TE>   the slaughter of the buffalo reduced them to the humbling status of
government wards. Now 56, this short, slightly plump woman has lived on
the reservation most of her life.</TE>
<TE>   In Browning, she spends much of her time schooling Native Americans in
the basics of starting their own businesses. On the ranch, she shares
chores with her husband, Alvin, including spreading hay for cattle in
winter when the ground is blanketed with snow. Last spring, during a
bitter cold snap, she saved two newborn calves from freezing by warming
them in the shower. Then she took a blow dryer to them for good measure.</TE>
<TE>   As she goes about this isolated existence just a few miles south of
the Canadian border, Cobell also lives a second life--one arising from
another story handed down by generations of Blackfeet that also is at
odds with official versions of the truth. The tale is still being
written, with Cobell emerging as the patient warrior whose labors over
the last quarter century have brought the U.S. Interior Department to its
knees. She has poised her tribe, along with countless other Native
Americans, to reap billions of dollars in payments owed them by the
government.</TE>
<TE>   cobell's office is on the top floor of a tired two-story building
painted a sickly shade of drab olive. Many other buildings in town are
worse, including a number of boarded-up trailers on cluttered, overgrown
lots. Sidewalks and paved roads are a recent addition to Browning.
Unemployment hovers at around 70% in winter, when construction jobs dry
up and the Blackfeet hunker down against the cold. In winter, dirty snow
adds to the forlorn scene, and it is well into May before the wildflowers
bloom and the plains turn green. On most days, a strong wind howls
through town.</TE>
<TE>   But its backdrop is the soaring, snow-capped Rockies at the gateway to
Glacier National Park. It is here that Cobell first began sorting out the
mystery of the missing money.</TE>
<TE>   One of eight children in a home with no electricity, running water or
telephone, she grew up listening to stories of Baker's Massacre, in which
American soldiers slaughtered 200 Blackfeet, most of them women and
children, after ambushing them on the banks of Montana's Marias River.
She heard other tales about how Indian children were sent off to distant
boarding schools for years at a time, where speaking their native Piegans
was cause for punishment. And, too, she heard stories of government
checks. She heard her parents wonder why those payments never made sense.</TE>
<TE>   The talk of the checks in Cobell's house was similar to those in
thousands of other homes on reservations throughout the American West.
The checks arrived sporadically and they were for amounts no one
understood. They knew the money was payment for land allotted to them but
leased out by the government to timber, mineral or ranching interests,
but they had no luck persuading the Interior Department or its Bureau of
Indian Affairs to explain or account for the amounts. This haphazard way
of doing business is called the Indian trust system. It is at the heart
of the story.</TE>
<TE>   In 1887, Congress passed a law intended to "civilize" the Indians and
dilute the tribal structure. Known as the Dawes Act, each Indian head of
household was given as much as 320 acres. But because the government
didn't believe Indians capable of managing their own affairs, they were
barred from actual ownership. The land was put in trusts, with the U.S.
government as the overseer.</TE>
<TE>   The law also contained a loophole allowing the sale of "surplus" land.
Vast tracts were sold to white settlers under that provision. By 1932,
Indians had sold off 90 million acres--about 65% of their holdings. The
Interior Department supervised the leasing of the remaining Indian land.
Theoretically, the government paid all leasing fees into Indian accounts.</TE>
<TE>   But the accounting system was sloppy and unworkable from the start and
only got worse as time went on. Checks would go unclaimed because people
moved away, leaving no forwarding address. In other cases, the land would
be divided among heirs, further complicating the bookkeeping. Also,
thousands of records were lost or destroyed, making a fair accounting
virtually impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The Indians had only limited knowledge of these government inner
workings. Certainly Cobell did not. All she knew were the stories. She
tucked them away as part of the Blackfoot lore, never imagining they
would consume much of her life.</TE>
<TE>   Though her family had limited resources, Cobell's parents stressed the
value of education. When she was 4, Cobell's father took her with him
when he visited the small reservation school. She found a desk and
refused to leave until her father promised she could return the following
day to begin her formal education. After high school, she headed for
Great Falls Commercial College and then spent two years at Montana State
University in Bozeman.</TE>
<TE>   College was cut short when Cobell returned to the reservation to care
for her dying mother. Then came her decision in 1968 to leave the
reservation behind her, to move to Seattle and begin a career. There she
met Alvin, also a Blackfoot, who made his living fishing the waters off
the Alaska coast. She got a job in the accounting department of a Seattle
television station. They had a son, Turk. Life was promising and the pay
was good. She thought she was through with reservation life forever.</TE>
<TE>   Funny how things can change, though, how a chance incident can set a
new course for a life or, in this case, an entire people. On a return
visit to Montana in 1970, Alvin realized he wanted to come home. He had
grown up hunting and fishing in the mountains, and the lure of the
majestic peaks pulled him back. So the three Cobells moved back to her
family's ranch. Six years after they returned, Elouise Cobell was offered
the job as treasurer of the Blackfoot Nation. She was 30 years old.</TE>
<TE>   It was like being handed a migraine. The slipshod tribal accounting
system was, as she puts it, "in total chaos." She began slogging through
the books, such as they were, finding more questions than answers. Why,
for instance, was the Blackfoot tribal trust drawing negative interest?
How could this be when, by law, trust money must be invested by the
government in the safest securities? Why was she seeing money leaving the
tribal account when she was the only one authorized to write the checks?
When she raised the questions with the local BIA, from which much of the
money flowed, the withering response was that she should learn to read a
financial statement.</TE>
<TE>   Humiliated, Cobell plodded on. When financial discrepancies arose--and
that was often--she would write to the Interior Department. "I'd write
and write and write," she says. "One guy hadn't paid in a year" for land
he used. "He'd gotten away with all the oil on a lease for free."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't as if the trusts ran her life. The ranch and the
treasurer's work added up to more than a full-time job, and as Turk grew
older, Cobell tried to be on hand to watch her son compete for his high
school's football, basketball and track teams. Turk Cobell recalls his
mother driving hundreds of miles to watch him play. "I think I can count
the number of events she missed on one hand," says Turk, now a manager at
Sunset Station Hotel and Casino in Henderson, Nev.</TE>
<TE>   Though it took years to accomplish, Cobell began making headway with
the Blackfoot tribal finances. In 1987, she was the prime mover in
founding the first tribal-owned bank in the nation, opening the door for
her people to finance their own businesses. Browning in those days was a
boarded-up disaster--far worse than today. Its residents had almost no
hope of making a living on their own. These days, although Browning is
hardly thriving, Cobell can point to various businesses, from the Glacier
Restaurant to the Browning Video store to the Dollar Store, that are
Indian-owned. It's a start.</TE>
<TE>   On the larger issue of accounting for the individual lease money,
however, Cobell was making almost no progress. Washington virtually
ignored her, even as her people kept asking for help. Josephine Wild Gun,
for instance, asked why she was receiving less than $1,000 a year even
though 7,000 acres of family land were being leased out for grazing, oil,
minerals and timber. Cobell had no answer.</TE>
<TE>   After more than a decade of frustration, she finally found a
sympathetic ear. David Matheson, deputy commissioner for Indian affairs
under the first Bush administration, was a member of Idaho's Coeur
d'Alene tribe. Unlike other officials she had approached over the years,
Matheson understood. He remembered how his own parents and grandparents
on the reservation believed they had been ripped off in timber sales and
leased land. He also remembered how they had been warned by the BIA not
to make trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "The BIA had a very prominent role in generations gone by in taking
resources from the tribes and giving them to other people," Matheson
says. "But then a generation would pass and the problems never got
resolved. We all heard it over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   While Cobell had a willing ear in Matheson, he did not have much time
left at the BIA. George Bush was ousted by Bill Clinton just a year later
and Matheson was out of a job. But before he left office, he arranged for
Cobell to meet in Washington with a group of high-ranking government
officials and banking experts. It was a fortunate stroke, for among those
present was prominent Washington, D.C., banking lawyer Dennis Gingold,
known for his slashing take-no-prisoners style, who was there as a favor
to a friend. Gingold says he went to the session thinking he was to meet
with East Indians. "From my experience, American Indians were not
involved in banking," he recalls. "I was looking for a bunch of people
with turbans."</TE>
<TE>   What he heard that day from Cobell and others left him astonished. "I
had never known this type of problem existed," says the tough-talking
Seton Hall law graduate. The status of the Indian trusts were "a
disaster," he says. "Regulators would never allow this to go on at a
bank. A bank would be shut down."</TE>
<TE>   gingold recommended filing a lawsuit against the government. but
Cobell and others were reluctant. The cost would be enormous. Besides,
Matheson's ouster aside, the election of Clinton was cause for hope,
Cobell thought. She assumed the new president's administration would be
sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   Congress also was getting involved. In 1992, the House Committee on
Government Operations issued a scathing report titled "Misplaced Trust:
The Bureau of Indian Affairs' Mismanagement of the Indian Trust Fund."
William Clinger, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and
one of the authors of the report, says the intractability of the BIA was
nothing short of stunning.</TE>
<TE>   "Every six months or so we'd haul them in again and then nothing ever
happened," he recalls. "They had the chutzpah to say 'Well, we're working
on it.' There was total incompetence in the BIA. They didn't have the
wherewithal to deal with this sort of thing."</TE>
<TE>   Two years after the report, Congress passed the landmark Indian Trust
Fund Management Reform Act, appointing a trustee to oversee straightening
out the financial mess. That trustee was veteran banker Paul Homan, known
for his ability to clean up troubled financial institutions. He had been
the CEO of four problem banks and the executive vice president of another
before coming to Washington as the president and CEO of Riggs Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Homan soon discovered the job was a nightmare. Records were in such
disarray that it was impossible to tell how many people were due money.
Of the 238,000 individual trusts Homan's crew located, 50,000 had no
addresses, which meant the money never left the Treasury. Some 16,000
accounts had no documents at all, and 118,000 were missing crucial
papers.</TE>
<TE>   Given those sorry conditions, it was reasonable to assume funds were
skimmed from the trusts over the years, Homan says. "It's akin to leaving
the vault door open," he says. "You leave it open and sooner or later
it's going to tempt somebody. If you don't have records and you don't
have management, you don't have much." Homan later resigned his post,
saying Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt refused to give him the kind of
support he needed for reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Still uncertain about filing a lawsuit, Cobell bumped into Atty. Gen.
Janet Reno at a conference. After a brief conversation, Cobell says Reno
promised to take a personal interest in the trust issue and invited her
to Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   As Cobell planned her trip, Gingold, long experienced in the ways of
the capital, tried to warn her that officials can mean well, but getting
results is another matter. "I told her not to expect anything," Gingold
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   He was right. When Cobell arrived in Washington, Reno handed the case
to a deputy without so much as a brief audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the straw that broke the camel's back," Cobell says.</TE>
<TE>   massive lawsuits are massively expensive, and this was one of the
largest class-action suits ever filed. To press this one would cost
millions of dollars for lawyers and court fees and expenses and, just as
important, for an army of accountants to try to sort out 100 years of
sloppiness. It was money the Blackfeet simply did not have. It was also a
step some Native Americans opposed, largely because they believe the BIA
is a friend as well as a link between two nations.</TE>
<TE>   But Cobell wasn't about to stop. If a lawsuit would be expensive, she
would become a rainmaker. She knew that a century of injustice is a
powerful appeal. She also knew that her years of arguing with the BIA,
not to mention her banking experience, had brought her into contact with
an array of organizations, including the Otto Bremer Foundation of St.
Paul, Minn. The regional foundation's goal is to promote social justice
in four northern states--Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and Montana.
So she started there, with a director who already knew of her odyssey.
The foundation responded with a $75,000 grant and a $600,000 loan.</TE>
<TE>   And so it began. On June 10, 1996, the Boulder-based Native American
Rights Fund filed a class-action lawsuit against the Interior and
Treasury departments, with Cobell as the lead plaintiff and Gingold as
the lead attorney. The suit, filed on behalf of half a million Native
Americans, accused the two agencies of failing to fulfill their fiduciary
duties to manage the trust funds.</TE>
<TE>   Then Cobell caught a huge break. In 1997, the John D. MacArthur
Foundation gave her a $300,000 "genius award"--quite out of the blue.
Cobell had never heard of the foundation. Surprised but elated at the
windfall, she threw most of the money into the legal defense kitty. She
didn't know that in Santa Fe, N.M., one J. Patrick Lannan Jr., whose
Lannan Foundation has a keen interest in Native American causes, was
reading about Cobell's MacArthur award. Lannan asked the foundation if
Cobell had applied for a Lannan grant. Yes, he was told, and the
application had been rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued, Lannan flew to Montana. He met Cobell for coffee at the
Glacier National Park lodge and they talked for almost two hours. What
the Native Americans needed most, Cobell told him, was money to hire
accountants, people to crunch the numbers in preparation for their day in
court.</TE>
<TE>   Lannan left the lodge without promising any money. When he reached the
Great Falls airport, he telephoned Cobell with a pledge of $1 million.
Then he boarded the plane for Sante Fe. By the time he landed, he'd upped
the figure to $2 million. Later, when that money ran out, the foundation
chipped in another $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always prided ourselves in the fact that if something needs to
be done, we should so it," says Lannan, whose family made its fortune in
finance. "There was something about her that really impressed us. I guess
it was her ability to describe what it's been like to be an Indian in
this sort of thing."</TE>
<TE>   To date, legal and accounting expenses have amounted to about $8
million.</TE>
<TE>   when gingold was plotting his strategy about where to file the
lawsuit, he knew that federal courts in Washington and New York are much
less likely to be overturned on appeal. Partly as a matter of
convenience, Gingold chose Washington. Then, he said, "We won the
lottery."</TE>
<TE>   The judge assigned the case was U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a
native Texan who favors boots and large cars. At first blush, the
selection seemed dubious. Lamberth was a Reagan appointee whose decisions
had often rankled the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   But Gingold knew that the judge had laser-like concentration when
dealing with complicated subjects. That would be a plus in the trust
case, with its voluminous boxes of documents and accountant-speak.
Further, Lamberth had been a federal prosecutor for many years, giving
him an insider's view of the federal bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning of the case, it was clear that the government could
not produce the records that would have allowed accountants to reconcile
the trust balance and get at least a rough estimate of how much the
Indians had been paid. Many of the records had already been destroyed
and, to make matters worse, 162 boxes of case-related documents were
shredded after the trial began, a procedure Justice Department lawyers
withheld from the court for three months.</TE>
<TE>   Other records were in Louisiana and in rat-infested warehouses in New
Mexico. Many more were kept haphazardly on reservations. The government
promised to produce various records during the trial, though it was
eventually clear that would prove to be impossible. Lamberth also
discovered that the Interior Department's computer system was so porous
that hackers could set up trust accounts. He ordered the system shut down
until the holes were plugged.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 22, 1999, Lamberth held Babbitt, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and an assistant secretary for Indian affairs, Kevin Gover, in
contempt for failing to produce records ordered by the court. The judge
also imposed fines of more than $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   In December 1999, Lamberth issued a 126-page opinion against the
government. He called the case "a shocking pattern of deception. I have
never seen more egregious conduct by the federal government."</TE>
<TE>   Equally blunt, Cobell says: "I'd like to see a few people go to jail
for this."</TE>
<TE>   The government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals, but was soundly
rebuffed, and opted not to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The folks at Interior are going to have to cut to the chase and admit
they don't have the records and settle up," says Bruce E. Johansen, who
teaches Native American studies at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.
"They aren't fessing up to what they don't have and can't do."</TE>
<TE>   But no settlement is on the horizon, which leaves the case far from
over. A second phase of the trial, which is not yet on the court docket,
will be held to determine how much the government owes. Gingold says he
believes the final award will be "far north of $10 billion," and a study
commissioned by the Interior Department warns that liability could be as
high as $40 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The government's legal team has had more than 100 lawyers assigned to
the case--more than the government employed in the complex Microsoft
antitrust litigation. "I think Justice doesn't want to give away the
store," says Clinger, the former congressman. "But the longer it goes on,
the worse it's going to get."</TE>
<TE>   in a ritual two years ago, Cobell was declared a warrior of the
Blackfoot Nation and presented with an eagle feather--an honor reserved
these days almost exclusively for U.S. armed services veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Cobell has traveled a lonely road, often dealing with a government
that ignored or insulted her, says Darrell Kipp, a Harvard-educated
Blackfoot who returned to the reservation intent on preserving the
Piegans language. "It took a lot of guts for her to do what she did,"
Kipp says. "Remember, we're a minority, a fact that sometimes escapes
greater America. Minorities do run a risk when we rise up like this."</TE>
<TE>   Cobell now speaks to children around the country about the ability of
Native Americans to succeed, even against long odds. Last month, more
than three decades after she left school to care for her mother, Cobell
returned to Montana State University to accept an honorary doctorate.</TE>
<TE>   When she drives through Browning these days, she sees progress where
others see poverty. Some homes on the north side of town are new and
well-tended. A new gas station is on the main drag because the owner was
able to borrow money from the Blackfoot bank.</TE>
<TE>   She heads out of town, talking as she drives. The time has come for
the government to settle, she says. For all the years of work, not a
single Indian has been paid a dime for the government's malfeasance and
neglect. "The government is going to fight this no matter what, even if
it's morally or ethically wrong," she says. "That's a real crime in
itself. They're in such denial, it's amazing. Congress needs to say no
more money to fight this litigation."</TE>
<TE>   The car swings south, past where the Blackfeet are buried at Ghost
Ridge. Then the tidy Cobell ranch house comes into view, with a new white
fence lining the driveway. She finds a solace in this place, where a
creek slices through the land near the house.</TE>
<TE>   She also takes comfort in Alvin, who shuns the spotlight that
sometimes falls on his wife. It's nothing he wants for himself, but he
takes pride in his wife for what she has accomplished. Sometimes he stops
her in mid-sentence as she rattles on about the case, and he tells her it
is time to talk about something else.</TE>
<TE>   There are days when Cobell admits to being somewhat wistful about that
$300,000 MacArthur award years ago, when she thinks of something she and
Alvin might have done with the money--such as a nice long vacation to
escape the frozen Montana winter. But then she shrugs and moves on.</TE>
<TE>   In the light of late afternoon, Cobell spotted two of her cows
standing by the roadside. They had found their way through a spot where
the barbed wire was sagging. Cobell, dressed in a light blue business
suit and street shoes, made her way through the muck of the spring thaw
and herded the cows back onto her property. Her feet covered with mud,
she hunted around until she found a sturdy stick to prop up the wire.</TE>
<TE>   A rancher's life. Next morning, she would fly out of Great Falls for
more work in her other life--of Blackfoot warrior.</TE>

<HD>A Voice Suddenly Heard</HD>
<DH>Psychotherapist A.W. Richard Sipe Spent a Lifetime Studying Sexual
Abuse by Catholic Priests. Finally, People Are Listening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After four decades in snowy cities as a counselor and
psychotherapist, A.W. Richard Sipe was ready for retirement to sunny La
Jolla. There would be ample time for reading (he's a big Tony Hillerman
fan), travel and maybe some light intellectual labor, such as updating
one of his books. He was also eager to indulge a hobby he acquired as a
stress-reducer: doing needlepoint, mostly classic religious scenes.</LD>
<LD>   Sipe and his wife, Marianne Benkert, had picked the perfect spot, a
gated community in the swank Mt. Soledad neighborhood, and for the first
year or so, the retirement went largely as planned. He worked at his
writings at an unhurried pace, and Benkert, a psychiatrist, joined a
clinic at UC San Diego. "I thought my life's work was pretty much over,"
says Sipe, 69. "I thought coming to La Jolla was like going to heaven,
with all your work done."</LD>
<LD>   Instead, his hours are now filled with phone calls, faxes and
letters--pleas from journalists, lawyers, former patients, even religious
figures, all begging for his advice, his consultation, an interview, a
lecture, something to help in the firestorm of a moral scandal unmatched
in U.S history. It's all happening because Sipe had devoted much of his
career to researching and writing about sexual abuses by Catholic clergy,
and to counseling the victims. Yet for all his labors, the American
public never quite seemed to be listening.</LD>
<TE>   Now it is. Sipe recently went to New York to talk to a documentary
filmmaker--one of several seeking his help--and returned home to find
more than 200 e-mails. Next it was off to Minnesota to help a school
there deal with the gathering crisis. His needlepoint has been put aside,
his Last Supper half-finished. "I've been called back into service," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   And a grisly service it is.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one keeps such statistics, it is doubtful anyone has met
more unchaste, or pedophile priests, or their traumatized victims than
Sipe, a Benedictine monk-turned-counselor whose practice led him to
explore a world that many in the Roman Catholic church, until recently,
denied even existed.</TE>
<TE>   In lectures, professional articles and three groundbreaking books--"A
Secret World: Sexuality and the Search for Celibacy," "Sex, Priests and
Power: Anatomy of a Crisis" and "Celibacy: A Way of Living, Loving and
Serving"--Sipe argued, backed with statistics and case studies, that
sexual abuse of children was rampant among priests and that many priests
become, in effect, accomplished serial rapists.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his efforts, and those of other reform-minded counselors and
priests, he had no indication when he closed his practice in Baltimore
that the church would ever acknowledge the moral corruption within its
ranks. But in January, the Boston Globe and then other newspapers began
uncovering the kind of widespread sexual abuse and official cover-up that
Sipe had long warned was festering. Suddenly the world that had been
ignoring him began banging on his door. There is no joy in the
turnabout--but there is a modicum of vindication.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel so alone anymore," he says.</TE>
<TE>   as befits a counselor, sipe is gracious and comforting and informal.
He sees no need to find a fancy term to describe the mendacity of the
church. He'll use a barnyard epithet when it seems appropriate. He does
not preach, argue or chest-beat. In conversation, his observations and
case histories start slowly and then come pouring out.</TE>
<TE>   Only one thing makes him particularly angry: The assertion by some
defenders of the status quo that victims are coming forth now, years
after the incidents, because they hope to make money by threatening
lawsuits. "My experience is that the primary motivation in the people I
deal with is: 'I don't want that [SOB] to do it to anybody else,' " he
says.</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the church's sexual corruption, Sipe believes, is a
system that keeps priests in a state of perpetual adolescence by refusing
to confront the issue of normal sexual urges. "We have said for years
that the church fosters and prefers adolescent development in their
clergy," Sipe says. "They're easier to manage, they're easier to control.
Adolescents, you know, are wonderful. They're enthusiastic, they can be
committed and can be ascetic, and they have many, many good qualities.
They can align themselves with a cause and go to the death for it. But if
you're an adolescent psychosexually, who are you attracted to? You're
attracted to other adolescents."</TE>
<TE>   Prominent on the living room wall of Sipe and Benkert's
Spanish-Mission-style home are several Crucifixion scenes by a painter
from Taos, N.M. Other religious artwork is sprinkled through the house,
which they share with their aging calico cat, Gwen.</TE>
<TE>   Sipe's battle is not with the Catholic faith but with the application
of that faith. He and his wife attend Mass each Sunday. "Richard and I
both believe we are very spiritual," says Benkert, 68. "There's a
difference between spirituality and the church as a bureaucracy. That's
what we want people to separate. The church bureaucracy is in trouble,
but spirituality remains strong."</TE>
<TE>   Their own spirituality has deep roots. Sipe was born Walter Richard
Sipe on Dec. 11, 1932, in Robbinsdale, Minn., a farming town of 5,000
within the shadow of Minneapolis. He had an upbringing that he jokes
could have been a chapter of a Sinclair Lewis novel: The dominant values
were Republicanism and pro-business; life centered around school and the
church; and Main Street was two blocks long and full of stores.</TE>
<TE>   Sipe's father owned several gas stations. The family was devoutly
Catholic, and Sipe admired the enthusiastic young monks who came down to
do parish work from St. John's Abbey in Collegeville, 80 miles away. "I
was pious, I was intellectually inclined, I think I needed community
support," Sipe says. "You know, if you're one of 10 kids, how do you make
your mark?"</TE>
<TE>   He graduated from St. John's Preparatory School and St. John's
University, and after studying at Collegio Sant Anselmo in Rome, he
arrived in 1957 at St. John's Seminary, run by the same Benedictine monks
he had admired as a boy. It was there that he was ordained as a Roman
Catholic priest and took the first name Aquinas, which he still uses
today as an initial.</TE>
<TE>   He worked as a counselor in a Catholic high school in Cold Spring,
Minn., and then as executive director at St. John's University Institute
for Mental Health. He began to encounter students who had been abused by
priests, and priests who could not stop stalking young boys. At the same
time, he began to have doubts about committing his life to the church and
forsaking marriage and a family of his own.</TE>
<TE>   "It just churned my guts upside down," he says. "I went into treatment
with a good person and he helped me get some sense and put it together.
The first thing was not sex but that I really couldn't live this life.
The obedience just doesn't make any sense. So that was it. But once I
made that decision, God, I fell in love with Mary. I've never had that
experience."</TE>
<TE>   He enrolled in a religious counseling program at Baltimore's Seton
Psychiatric Institute, where Marianne Benkert was doing a residency in
psychiatry. Benkert was born in South-Central Los Angeles and raised in
Arcadia. She was a nun in the Maryknoll Sisters order and a graduate of
St. Louis University of Medical School. Like Sipe, she was having doubts
about the religious life. They married in 1970 and their son, Walter
Edward Sipe, was born in 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Life for the couple has been a series of academic appointments and
professional positions at prestigious clinics and hospitals in the
Baltimore area, such as Johns Hopkins Medical School, St. Mary's Seminary
and University, Loyola College, Woodstock College and the U.S. Public
Service Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Sipe has counseled hundreds of priests who have broken their vows of
celibacy with consenting adults, or sexually abused children or young
adults. He has also counseled many of their victims. After serving as a
consultant in at least 58 cases of abuse victims seeking restitution or
acknowledgment from the church, he is receiving almost daily requests to
help in the burgeoning number of cases nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years he has seen it all: priests who have impregnated women
and are urging them to have abortions, transvestite priests, priests who
select altar boys on their potential as sexual targets, priests who
condone the conduct of fellow priests because they know of the sexual
transgressions of the laity and priests who dismiss their actions as just
"fooling" around.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been times in our careers," he says, "when we've said,
'God, we can't take anymore. We just can't take another revelation
because of the hypocrisy, because of the damage.' Those aren't
intellectual exercises. It breaks your heart."</TE>
<TE>   a criticism of sipe's writings has been that he has drawn his
conclusions--such as the belief that half of priests do not remain
celibate--from the priests who have come to him for treatment rather than
from a more scientifically grounded random sample. Sister Mary Ann Walsh,
deputy director of communications for the U.S. Catholic Conference, an
organization of American bishops, took issue with his conclusions in
"Secret World."</TE>
<TE>   "One instance of sexual abuse is one too many, but one can rightly
hope that conclusions drawn from a research base such as Mr. Sipe's
should not be seen as reflective of the general population of priests,
the vast majority of whom are faithful to their commitments."</TE>
<TE>   Eugene Kennedy, an ex-priest, university professor and columnist for
the Religion News Service, says of Sipe, "He's been written off by the
institution because he challenges their conception of reality. He's a
noble man. I don't know of anyone else who's tried dispassionately to
look at the most difficult of subjects."</TE>
<TE>   Sylvester P. Theisen, professor emeritus of sociology at Sipe's alma
mater, St. John's University, tried a middle approach in his review of
"Sex, Priests and Power." He wrote: "This reviewer thinks that the
officials of the Catholic church owe Sipe grateful attention but wishes
an editor had toned down the author's detracting arrogance."</TE>
<TE>   Although not a combative man, Sipe says his critics are missing the
point. He concedes that his conclusions are not based on anonymous
surveys or polling--but on collected data from individual cases.</TE>
<TE>   "When the church cannot refute my numbers, they attack how I collected
them," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a silver lining in the current crisis, Sipe says, it may
be that it will force the church to confront the forbidden topic of
sexuality. Ideally, the church would open its leadership ranks to women,
he says, and begin debating whether celibacy is an attainable goal for
all priests.</TE>
<TE>   The church's revolutionary Second Vatican Council (1962-64) "neglected
to talk about human sexuality. They dealt with everything else:
communications, ecumenism, world involvement, justice, the
Jewish-Christian question, everything. And although the focus of what's
happening now is sexual abuse of minors, the larger topic under
discussion is sexuality, the only question the church has not wanted to
discuss."</TE>
<TE>   He was disappointed in this year's Vatican gathering, where Pope John
Paul II called together American bishops and cardinals to discuss the
scandal. He wished that the pope had been more forthright in announcing a
"zero-tolerance" policy. He is more heartened by the resolve of American
bishops who met in Dallas last month. "It's a good first step but they're
going to have trouble being as public as they promised. They're just not
in the habit."</TE>
<TE>   Although some people may be shocked at the actions of Boston
Archbishop Bernard F. Law, who has been under fire for protecting abusive
priests by moving them to new parishes, Sipe says Law is sadly typical of
bishops he has encountered.</TE>
<TE>   If Sipe has some professional sympathy for the priests who are
attracted sexually to children--because he understands their underlying
psychological problems--he has none for the cardinals and bishops and
other ranking church officials who cover up their crimes. "Some of them
are so terrible," Sipe says. "I mean the plain lying that I've seen,
bishop after bishop saying, 'No, this was never true. I don't know
anything. I can't remember anything.' And sometimes the bishop just
smiles. One bishop said, 'I only lie when I have to.' "</TE>
<TE>   The bishops, Sipe alleges, are worried only about themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is this: There are a number of bishops who have this in
their background [even though] they may have done very good work since
that time. If they put that down retrospectively, they're going to have
to clean house in a very, very formidable way."</TE>
<TE>   In May he returned to his former abbey to help the monks confront a
long-hidden scandal: that a former abbot had repeatedly seduced younger
monks. The new abbot decided the scandal must go public. Sipe had
counseled some of the victims but because of therapist-patient
confidentiality had been forced to keep silent.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the pain of my position," he says. "I've known too much for
too many years."</TE>

<DH>A Venice Garden Mixes Japanese and Tropical Plantings with an
Airstream Trailer and a Craftsman House</DH>

<LD>Fred Sutherland grew up gardening on a tiny lot in Newport Beach,
where his dad, an ex-merchant marine, soothed his sailor's heart by
building boatlike decks and wrapping columns with nautical rope. Later,
in San Juan Capistrano, there was a Wild West garden full of hollyhocks,
covered wagons and old car parts. "He was an odd, eclectic guy," recalls
Sutherland, who has hung a star-shaped lamp of his dad's over his own
Venice garden gate. "His life, environment and art were all one. That
approach rubbed off on me."</LD>
<LD>   Though Sutherland's life took a different turn--he does residential
and commercial development and design and co-owns the Los Feliz
restaurant Fred 62--his garden is as personal and passionate as his late
father's were. Beyond that rose-wrapped, Japanese-style gate, around his
eggplant-colored house, red banana trees rustle among bamboo and goldfish
dart beneath water hyacinth in a pond. His potting bench was once a
restaurant prep table, and his backyard fountain is filled with
succulents dripping from its tiered bowls. In his borders, onions grow
beside nandinas; tomatoes splash around agaves, ferns and verbena. "First
I fall in love with plants. Then I find out what they do," he says.</LD>
<TE>   Take the 'Ingrid Bergman' rose. A deep, velvety maroon with red-tinged
new leaves, it called to him from the aisles of Home Depot's plant
department. He bought several and plunked them in beside cactuses and
salvia and amid herbs, where they stand out like moody flags. "I leave
them wild and gangly, just barely trimmed," he says. "They're hardier
than I expected. Of course they pick up every bug that comes along, every
mildew, and I battle them all plant by plant."</TE>
<TE>   Sutherland started his garden in 1990 after returning from seven years
in New York, where he'd designed apartment interiors for artists such as
Kenny Scharf and Jean-Michel Basquiat. With his wife Jessica, Sutherland
bought a 1920s bungalow on a 40-by-70-foot lot that was smothered in
concrete. Once he blasted out the paving, he began planting in a frenzy:
morning glories, ficus, nasturtiums--"all the wrong stuff," he concedes.
"I learned by watching things take over, ripping them out and starting
again."</TE>
<TE>   On his second pass, he chose more carefully: fruit trees (apples,
guavas, peaches, plums, pears), along with shade greens such as ferns and
callas and, for a sunny corner, lavatera.</TE>
<TE>   Then he and Jessica bought the house next door, the 1918 Craftsman
where they live now with their children, Emmett, 11, and Travis, 13. This
doubled Sutherland's garden space and gave him more room to experiment
with tropical plants and to create outdoor living spots. He built his
fishpond and introduced the banana trees (leftovers from a restaurant
he'd designed). He scrapped his driveway for a garden-edged path, built a
lounging deck and installed an outdoor bed. He also hauled in an
Airstream trailer as an office/guest house, creating a "Florida fantasy"
around it, complete with cannas, birds of paradise and more bananas. Near
this "homage to John Waters," there's a tree made of glass bottles, a
garden path of  restaurant-kitchen floor matting and a planting bed
stuffed with bronze flax, echeverias, red tea tree, acacias and aeoniums,
which, improbably, work together. "I'm fascinated by dramatic layering
and depth, the illusion that, if you can't see past something, it might
just go on forever."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, having admired perfectly round melons in Japan, he trained
honeydews up a fence, where they ballooned and ripened like living
ornaments. This year he's teaching himself the art of bonsai, practicing
on baby junipers from Home Depot. He has designed a swimming pool, which
will soon replace the Airstream trailer.</TE>
<TE>   He hand-waters his plants, which allows him to mix whatever he likes,
including drought-tolerant species with thirsty greens. As he waters, he
prunes; as he prunes, he considers whether or not it's time to feed the
beds with fish emulsion. "No one knows how obsessive I am out here," he
admits. "It's insane. But I like to focus on little details. Otherwise,
I'd never relax. Anywhere. Ever."</TE>

<HD>Changing His Tune</HD>
<DH>For His 8th Restaurant Downtown, Joachim Splichal Tries Italian</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's an unfortunate fact of life that most of the serious
restaurants in the L.A. area are concentrated on the Westside. Despite
that, Joachim Splichal, one of L.A.'s best-known entrepreneur-chefs,
doesn't have a single restaurant there.</LD>
<LD>   The one restaurant the German-born, French-trained chef did open on
the Westside, Max au Triangle in Beverly Hills, failed. Then came Patina
(which is celebrating its 13th birthday this year) and a host of Patina
and Pinot spinoffs. Splichal recently opened his eighth restaurant
downtown, two blocks from Staples Center, called Zucca. That's his eighth
restaurant downtown, not his eighth restaurant. And this time it's
Italian, not French.</LD>
<LD>   When I say Splichal, I mean the Patina Group, which was bought by the
New York-based Restaurant Associates in 1999. However, Splichal and his
wife and partner, Christine, still run the group of 22 restaurants, most
of which are in Los Angeles. The Splichals have a talent for creating a
fun and lively ambience--think Cafe Pinot next to the main library
downtown, the martini bar at Pinot Hollywood, or the first Pinot, still
going strong: Pinot Bistro in Studio City.</LD>
<TE>   Zucca, in keeping with its Italian theme, looks the part of a big city
ristorante. Occupying the bottom of an office building at 8th Street and
South Figueroa, it's one of the few downtown L.A. restaurants that has a
presence on the street. Cafe curtains screen the diners, but the milky
Venetian glass chandeliers, red silk lampshades and colorful,
hand-painted majolica platters and vases in the windows telegraph the new
restaurant to passers-by.</TE>
<TE>   At the entrance, ottoman-size wheels of Parmigiano-Reggiano peek out
from a display window. Past the heavy brass-trimmed doors, the first
thing a guest sees is the fire of the wood-burning pizza oven. Next to
it, an antique wooden cabinet shows off Zucca's signature handmade
biscotti.</TE>
<TE>   At lunch and at dinner, the latter when most of downtown is often
dead, Zucca is full of life, every table filled, a throng at the bar. The
place looks as if it has been here forever, even though it's only 5
months old. That may be because the Splichals hauled much of the decor
straight from Italy, such as the trio of Murano glass chandeliers, or the
floor, which the waiter tells me was lifted from an abandoned Tuscan
villa. On the walls, in San Francisco painter Charley Brown's scenes of
Carnival in Venice, masked figures in a swirl of black capes dance above
the glamorous butter-yellow banquettes.</TE>
<TE>   Waiters are dressed in crisp white jackets embroidered with ZUCCA. The
word has a nice fat sound. It's Italian for pumpkin, a theme that recurs
throughout the menu.</TE>
<TE>   A new manager, who is French and fresh from his last posting in Dubai,
dishes out the risotto of the day--radicchio with quail. The glaze is
delicious, aceto balsamico with Barolo and some rosemary.</TE>
<TE>   The best appetizer is uncooked, which says something about the kitchen
headed by executive chef Giancarlo Gottardo. This dish is a platter of
thinly sliced rustic salame and supple prosciutto di Parma. Another time,
the soup of the day is a lovely potato with saffron, zucchini and ribbons
of squash blossom.</TE>
<TE>   Pizzetta di zucca is a little pizza smeared with roasted red winter
pumpkin (there's that zucca), goat cheese and caramelized onion. It's not
much of a success. And what's this mystery appetizer? It's seared
scallops perched on a bruschetta of toast spread with roasted eggplant.
How are you supposed to eat this misconceived dish? You can't exactly
pick it up and take bites out of the hefty scallop.</TE>
<TE>   Plating tends to look messy, with too much sauce, too many
ingredients. It's as if cafeteria cooks were asked to perform in a
professional kitchen. The model is all wrong. Fritto misto, for example,
offers hunks of broccoli florets, asparagus, green beans and julienned
zucchini in a thick, somewhat greasy batter. The sauce, oddly, is a
garbanzo dip. Heavy and heavier. For one salad, baby artichokes and diced
tomatoes are turned out of a mold and topped with two huge seared
scallops. It's not a pretty picture.</TE>
<TE>   At lunch, panzanella, or Tuscan bread salad, is made with croutons
instead of torn stale bread soaked in water. This is a dish that only
works if it's made with top-quality ingredients--peppery green-gold olive
oil, ripe tomatoes, cucumbers and fragrant sweet basil--which is not the
case here. Nothing sings in the salad of grilled shrimp with white beans,
aceto balsamico and arugula. The sweetness of the aceto doesn't do a
thing for the beans. Starchy and bland, they need something more
refreshing and acidic, such as red wine vinegar or lemon.</TE>
<TE>   Pastas tend to be oversauced. Sardinian "gnochetti," a ribbed shell
pasta tossed in a sausage rag laced with fennel and topped with pungent
pecorino, is a hearty and sloppy dish that will put hair on your chest.
The best of the pastas I tried was the linguine alle vongole, made with
tiny clams in the shell. It has a nice balance of garlic and white wine
to olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   Among the stuffed pasta dishes, panzerotti would be a light and
satisfying dish if the kitchen cut down on the amount of tomato heaped on
top. It features little packets of dough stuffed with mozzarella in a
plain marinara of diced plum tomatoes. One day at lunch, I headed
straight for the ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach in an artichoke
ragout. But I can tell before I take a bite that the pasta is too thick
and stiff as cardboard. The filling is delicious, though, when you can
taste it through the sauce. When the waiter proffers "Parmesan," to
Zucca's credit, it's a hunk of that Parmigiano-Reggiano freshly grated
over your plate.</TE>
<TE>   But how to explain Zucca's signature pumpkin tortellini? They're huge,
clumsy things, as big as quail and stuffed to bursting with roasted
pumpkin the texture of baby food.</TE>
<TE>   But, I have to say, branzino, or striped bass, roasted in the
wood-burning oven, is one of the better versions I've had. It's firm and
has some flavor, in short a fish you'd want to meet. A halibut special,
though, is curiously bland. Nobody at the table attempts to finish it.</TE>
<TE>   That wood-burning oven is responsible for the fine bistecca--T-bone
steak for two served with chard and wild mushrooms. Downtown, this one
dish is enough to put the place on the map. The rotisserie also turns out
a fine arista (roasted pork loin) that's pink and juicy, basically a loin
roast on the bone three fingers high. Why this nice piece of pork is
sitting on acrid and salty braised cabbage is puzzling. Why the kitchen
thinks a dark transparent veal reduction the color of varnish is more
Italian than the pork's natural juices, I have no idea.</TE>
<TE>   Any of the meats from the wood-burning oven or rotisserie are an
excuse to pop open a Chianti Classico or Brunello. In putting the wine
list together, Patina sommelier Chris Meeske has done his homework. Along
with the well-known and ever more pricey heavy-hitters such as Gaja or
Castello di Ama are wines from rising young producers or lesser-known
wine regions.</TE>
<TE>   As for dessert, order the</TE>
<TE>   panna cotta, or Piedmontese "cooked cream." It tastes as it should:
barely sweetened cream, though with a touch too much gelatin, and is
surrounded by a deep stain of strawberries and raspberries. Zabaglione,
that seductive froth of egg yolks, sugar and Marsala, is served as a
gratin with a kind of bruleed sugar crust on top, which adds interest to
the texture. But mixing berries in with the zabaglione may not have been
the best idea: You no longer get the ravishing contrast of warm
zabaglione and cool berries.</TE>
<TE>   For those with a real sweet tooth, there's a ricotta cheesecake
wrapped in pale green marzipan. If you want to end with pumpkin, get the
caramel pumpkin gelato.</TE>
<TE>   After several meals at Zucca, I'm left wondering why Splichal went
Italian--probably not to compete with his other downtown restaurants,
among them the French Cafe Pinot or the steakhouse Nick &amp; Stef's. I'd
have expected better from this experienced chef and restaurateur.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>While Patrick Kiger does an excellent job documenting the wretched
excess of our times ("Living Ever Larger," June 9), his article
raises a host of unanswered questions. What are the consequences of
attempting infinite growth on a finite planet? If our needs are
indeed created by corporate propaganda (i.e. marketing), can we truly
call ourselves free? If our intellect cannot subjugate our "reptilian
brain," are we doomed to the same fate as the dinosaurs? (Having
produced Excursions, Explorers and Expeditions, maybe Ford should
call its next model Extinction.) Some people have succeeded in
consciously limiting consumption and living minimally but
comfortably. How are they able to achieve this while the masses
blindly allow themselves to be hypnotized by the mantra of bigger is
better, more is better, and faster is better?</LD>

<TE>   It is a generally accepted notion that the need to oversize is a
way to compensate for a perceived shortcoming. So what are we lacking
as a society that keeps us addicted to excess? Direction? Compassion?
Morality? Discipline? Maybe all of the above and more. The tragedy is
that the resources required in our never-ending quest for more
prevent us from enjoying what we work for and the relationships that
could provide true wealth. As long as we place more value on what we
have, instead of on how we live, we will continue to have super-sized
lives and empty souls.</TE>

<HD>Urging for a Tougher Sierra Club Stance</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sierra Club is obviously trying to duck the issue of immigration
("The Sierra Club and the Immigration Freight Train," by James Ricci,
Metropolis, June 9). Pollution is a local, national and international
problem, just like rapid population growth. If the Sierra Club has
pushed for legislation to reduce pollution, why is it not willing to
lobby for measures to stop population growth in the U.S., which
should include immigration reductions? The Sierra Club has spent a
large amount of supporters' money fighting development. But it
refuses to urge elected officials in Washington, D.C., to reduce
immigration, the driving force behind the population growth in the
U.S. Where does the Sierra Club expect newcomers to live?</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How can Ben Zuckerman, a UCLA professor and Sierra Club board
member who claims to have a clue of the workings of the cosmos,
impose a view that California and Mexico are separate ecosystems?
Nature has no borders. From a global perspective, what difference
does it make if 100,000 or a million Mexicans are here or there?
Ultimately, it is the same water and same air. For the Sierra Club to
even consider the lopsided view that immigrants (legal and illegal)
are California's biggest eco-threat is shocking. Compared to the life
span of a star, it was only a blink of an eye ago that California was
part of Mexico. California owes them, not vice versa. Immigrants are
a fact of life. Let's look at how we can accommodate people rather
than exclude them.</TE>

<LD>There's a bonanza in cruise ship bargains available for travelers who
don't mind taking a plane before they board their ship.</LD>
<LD>   Because many Americans still fear flying, especially flying
outside the continental United States, the cruises departing from
mainland ports that can be reached by car or train--Los Angeles; San
Diego; Miami; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.--are doing fairly well. But
departures from locations requiring a long flight--San Juan, Puerto
Rico; Hawaii; Barcelona, Spain--need help. Lines are turning to major
discounts to sell cabins.</LD>
<LD>   Here are some of the biggest cruise bargains awaiting the fearless
flier:</LD>
<TE>   * From Hawaii: GalaxSea Cruises and Tours, (800) 662-5450,
www.cruisestar.com, is offering discounted rates on 10-night
Norwegian Cruise Line trips that visit the most popular ports of the
Hawaiian Islands and Fanning Island in the Kiribati chain. The fall
cruises are by the Norwegian Wind, sailing round trip from Honolulu
and visiting Maui, Kauai, the Big Island and Fanning. The price is
$1,542 per person, including round-trip air fare from Los Angeles and
port charges. The Norwegian Wind is known for its cooked-to-order
meals, which run the gamut from French to Hawaiian.</TE>
<TE>   * From San Juan: If you're looking for a good buy for a family
foursome willing to share a cabin, another Norwegian Cruise Lines
trip may be for you. For departures Nov. 3 and 17 and Dec. 1, Cruise
Value Center, (800) 231-7447, www.cruisevalue.com, offers a weeklong
sailing for $470 per person, including port charges. Air fare add-on
from LAX is $529 to $599 per person, round trip. The vessel is the
Norwegian Sky, launched in 1999, which has six restaurants, golf
driving nets, two pools, four hot tubs and lots of bars (martini bar,
wine and tapas bar, cigar bar, sports bar). The ship sails round trip
from San Juan to St. Lucia, Dominica, St. Kitts, Barbados and St.
Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   If there are two of you rather than four, you might want to check
out the Carnival Destiny's itinerary. Cruise Value Center is selling
weekly sailings throughout autumn that start at $590 per person,
double occupancy, including port charges. Again, the air fare add-on
is $529 to $599 from Los Angeles. The seven-night itinerary is San
Juan to St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; Martinique; Barbados; and
Aruba, then back to San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   * From Barcelona: On Sept. 29, Cruise.com, primarily an Internet
cruise discounter, offers a seven-night Mediterranean sailing of
Royal Caribbean's Splendour of the Seas for $940 per person,
including port charges. The ship goes round trip from Barcelona to
ports within visiting distance of Nice, France; Florence, Italy;
Rome; Naples, Italy; and Malta. Air fare add-on from Los Angeles is
$1,374. To find out more, contact (800) 303-3337, www.cruise.com.</TE>
<TE>   * From the Bahamas: If you're looking for a sailing that's also an
educational experience, you might choose World Explorer Cruises.
Beginning Dec. 12, World Explorer will host an 18-night Mayan History
and Bird-Watching cruise, departing Nassau and sailing to Playa del
Carmen and Cozumel, Mexico, then on to Belize City and Puerto Limon,
Costa Rica, before transiting the Panama Canal. Once in the Pacific,
the ship stops at Puntarenas, Costa Rica; Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala;
and Acapulco and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, before disembarking
passengers in Ensenada.</TE>
<TE>   On board throughout the cruise will be naturalist Chuck Leavell
and Mesoamerican archeoastronomer Anthony Aveni. The price, based on
a companion-sails-free policy, is $2,450 per couple, plus taxes.
Third and fourth persons per cabin can sail for $895 each. Air fare
add-on from Los Angeles is $690 to fly from LAX to Nassau and from
San Diego to LAX. For more details, call (800) 854-3835,
www.wecruise.com.</TE>
<TE>   The few cruises mentioned here aren't all there are. Other deals
are available from the discounters mentioned above. Shop and compare.</TE>

<LD>You can spend five nights in Australia, including hotel, air fare and
car rental, for less than the typical air fare alone. There are two
off-season packages, both $998 per person, double occupancy, from
Discover Wholesale Travel in Costa Mesa that are good for departures
Aug. 2 to 30. Both offer round-trip nonstop air fare between Los
Angeles and Sydney on Air New Zealand, plus a five-day compact-car
rental with unlimited mileage. One package provides five nights'
lodging at Sydney's Pacific International Inn; the other lets you
roam with a pass good for five nights at Australia's Flag Hotels
chain. Airport taxes, about $90 per person, are extra. If you pay by
credit card instead of cash or check, the cost is 3% more. (866)

<HD>Passengers Face Tighter Security on Trains, Ships</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid new federal warnings of possible terrorist threats this summer,
security has been tightened on the rails and at sea.</LD>
<LD>   Amtrak, the debt-ridden national railroad system that recently
received a promise of a fresh infusion of federal cash, last week
began limiting passengers to two pieces of carry-on luggage and said
it would require identification tags on most such items. Purses,
laptops, briefcases and what it called "infant accessories" such as
car seats and strollers are not counted in the carry-on limit.</LD>
<LD>   Since fall, Amtrak has required identification on checked baggage.
Passengers can use their own identification tags or those supplied by
train crews, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Carnival Cruise Lines is "trying to phase in a more strict
posture" on the personal identification it requires of passengers in
the boarding process, spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said last week.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise company has required a photo identification plus proof
of citizenship, such as a passport, an original or certified copy of
a birth certificate, military identification or naturalization
papers. But Carnival has not always strictly enforced its policy, and
anywhere from a dozen to scores of passengers, especially repeat
guests, typically arrive each day for Carnival cruises without the
proper papers, De la Cruz said.</TE>
<TE>   Carnival in the last few weeks has been faxing travel agents and
contacting customers to remind them of the policy. De la Cruz said
the crackdown wasn't prompted by any particular incident.</TE>

<HD>Air Ticket Sales Post Year's First Gain</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A milestone in the recovery of air travel since Sept. 11 was reached
in May, when U.S. travel agents logged more in airline ticket sales
than during the same month last year, according to the Airline
Reporting Corp. The 1% gain was the first year-over-year increase
this year.</LD>
<LD>   Air fares remained lower, however, by an average of 21% for U.S.
travel and 6% for international travel compared with May 2001.</LD>

<LD>Last week the State Department renewed its ongoing "worldwide
caution." It advised traveling Americans to "remain vigilant during
the upcoming summer season" and said that the government has
"credible indications" that terrorist actions, including suicide
operations, may be imminent against what it called "U.S. interests."
The statement did not specify a place or time for the possible
attacks.... Are you a 20-something longing for a high-seas adventure?
You have only until July 10 to apply for the 15th annual Ship for
World Youth travel program, which will take 255 people between 20 and
30 on a cultural-exchange cruise from late October to early December.
The Japanese government pays for the cruise and economy air fares.

<DL></DL>
<LD>The makers of Crayola crayons have opened a store and crafts area for
children in Hanover, about 10 miles southwest of Baltimore.</LD>
<LD>   Reminiscent of the store-as-playground approach of FAO Schwarz and
the Toys R Us store in New York's Times Square, the Crayola Works
Studio &amp; Store devotes less than half its 20,000 square feet to
retail space and the rest to a crafts studio.</LD>
<LD>   Entrance to the retail area is free. Besides Crayola products, the
area has interactive stations where children can stretch images of
their faces, among other activities, plus a Volkswagen bug car and
walls that children can color on with markers and chalk. (Don't try
this at home, kids.) To enter the studio, visitors must buy crafts
kits, starting at $5.99, that provide the makings for decorating
wooden boxes, soccer balls and other objects to take home, a
spokeswoman said. Only one kit per family is needed for entry.</LD>
<TE>   The company, Binney &amp; Smith, continues to operate its Crayola
Factory museum in Easton, Pa., which also has a retail store and
activity areas plus a mock crayon production line.</TE>
<TE>   The Maryland store, at the Arundel Mills mall on Arundel Mills
Boulevard, is open 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday and
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sunday. (410) 799-0400, www.crayolaworks.com.</TE>

<HD>Downtown, a New Standard in Hip Hotels</HD>
<DH>Not far from MOCA's Warhol show is a place to stay that
Andy might have loved</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOS ANGELES</DL>
<LD>My friend Paul walked into my room at the new Standard hotel
downtown, settled into what passes for an easy chair and looked at
the king-size bed holding court on an extended platform.</LD>
<LD>   "This room is about sex," he declared. He sounded perturbed. What
Paul wants in a hotel room are velvety armchairs and a fluffy white
robe.</LD>
<LD>   I do too, usually. But there was plenty of luxury in my corner
room, with its deep bathtub, five windows and sweeping openness.
There was also a sense of humor. On the phone console, besides the
usual buttons labeled "room service," "housekeeping" and so on, were
options for "heaven," "hell" and "alibi." (I pushed each one and got
the same response: a message saying no one was available.)</LD>
<TE>   My visit two weeks ago to the new Standard--the sister of the
aggressively hip but relatively affordable Standard in West
Hollywood--was the centerpiece of a kind of pop-cultural weekend in
downtown L.A. Joined by various friends, I toasted the first night of
summer on the hotel's roof, toured the Andy Warhol retrospective at
the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art and dined in the Art Deco
restaurant Cicada.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived at the Standard on Friday night, eager to try the
rooftop bar that is fast becoming a hot hangout. Andre Balazs, the
hotelier behind the original Standard and the revival of its Sunset
Strip neighbor Chateau Marmont, fashioned this hotel on Flower Street
out of a Modernist 12-story office building.</TE>
<TE>   After a wait in the parking lot, an earpiece-wearing employee--not
a valet, just an attentive staffer who noticed a fuming guest--carted
my luggage through the lobby, a spectacle of shiny, dark floors,
magenta sofas and a sleek billiards table. Then the front desk clerk
delivered some bad news: The rooftop bar and pool would be closed
Saturday night for a private party.</TE>
<TE>   Even though I would have Friday night to see the roof, I was
disappointed. I wished I had been warned about the party earlier. "A
lot of times we don't know until right before," the clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, I had scored a $225 Gigantic room for $205
(the rate for a Huge room) courtesy of a reservations clerk who
purred over the phone that she wanted to hook me on the hotel.
According to the Standard's Web site, rates range from $500 (Bigger
Penthouse) to $125 (Medium room), though prices actually drop as low
as $95 (a few hard-to-get Medium rooms on a lower floor). In the
middle is the $325 Wow! rate that promises an "Extra-long room for
our Extra-long guests and those who appreciate them," a "tub big
enough for two or more" and an "emperor-size bed" bigger than a king.</TE>
<TE>   Except for the new, bright red carpeting, the corridors retain
their bland 1955 office-building look. But my Gigantic room--touted
as 460 square feet--was airy and inviting. The bathroom opened into
the bedroom, separated by a mesh curtain. (The toilet was partitioned
off by a door.) Later in the weekend, I peeked at a $125 room. It was
nice, but only a glass wall stood between the shower and the bedroom.
Whomever you stay with in that room should know you well.</TE>
<TE>   I was staying alone, but my friend Ralph joined me for dinner
Friday. As we headed for the roof--he in a sports jacket and dark
shirt, I in a funky print skirt and sleeveless top--we thought we
looked the part of hip downtowners. But as we stepped onto the roof,
never had my pashmina felt so out of fashion. Twentysomethings clad
in black suits, tight pants and short skirts chattered on loveseats.</TE>
<TE>   The lounge spreads across two levels, one appointed with furniture
so it looks like a living room transplanted outdoors. A deejay
ensures a constant but not overbearing beat. Near the infinity pool
on the upper level, red fiberglass pods house round waterbed lounges.</TE>
<TE>   We got drinks at the packed bar, tended by women with red tank
tops, hip-huggers and tattoos on their lower backs. Armed with skimpy
martinis in little glasses (what were they serving in the real
martini glasses?), we drank in the skyline.</TE>
<TE>   At the hotel's 24-hour restaurant, I had chicken and Ralph had
swordfish. We split a chopped salad and two half-bottles of
Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay, each weighing in at $20. Though it was
available only by the half-bottle, I felt it the best choice given
the rest of the wine list. At the end of the meal we split a
chocolate ice creamy concoction. The food was fine, but I expected
better decor than diner-like furnishings with lights turned low.</TE>
<TE>   Later we explored the lobby. I loved the entrance to the restroom,
where a curtain of heavy gold beads opens onto a unisex bank of
sinks. (The actual bathrooms are segregated.) It was like a scene out
of "Sex and the City."</TE>
<TE>   Not far from the bathroom is an old-fashioned photo booth. We had
so much fun posing that we sat on the little stool for two rounds of
picture-taking--a couple of $2 strips of miniature color photos, the
best deal in the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday started with room-service latte and toast, then 30
minutes on a recumbent bike--no uprights--in the Standard's
serviceable gym. After a shower, I headed out with another friend,
Tina, for the Warhol show at the Museum of Contemporary Art.</TE>
<TE>   We walked about four blocks from the hotel up a steep hill--more
exercise!--to MOCA and lunched on salads and bottled water at
Patinette in the courtyard outside the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Admission to the Warhol is timed to the hour, but visitors are
allowed to linger as long as they want. I bought tickets--$17 each on
the weekend--for the 2 p.m. admission at www.ticketmaster.com, where
I also paid an annoying "convenience" charge of $4.40 per ticket plus
a flat fee of $3.30.</TE>
<TE>   We wandered the galleries, taking in Warhol's works from his days
as a fashion illustrator to his period of distinctive portraiture.
The famous Warhols are here--Campbell's soup cans and portraits of
Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor and Jackie Kennedy--plus some pieces
visitors may not have seen before. I was intrigued by meticulous
pencil renderings of shoes and handbags, some accompanied by rebukes
written by Warhol's boss. ("The entire drawing is unattractive.")</TE>
<TE>   My favorites were the towering "Elvis I and II," which, hung
together, present four essentially identical images of Elvis--in a
signature splayed stance despite the cowboy get-up. Three of the
Elvises stare off to the side, while the eyes of one stare directly
at the viewer.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, they follow you," Tina observed as we crossed the room.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't rent the audio tour, but perhaps we should have. Except
for an introductory panel, the exhibit offers no text to explain
Warhol's development.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I returned to the Standard, it was bustling with
preparations for the private rooftop fete, thrown by Nike. It felt
like living with the host of a party to which I was not invited.</TE>
<TE>   So I was happy to leave with my friend Paul--the one who
pronounced my room too sexy for itself--and stroll 2 1/2 blocks
(about the maximum in 3-inch stilettos) to Cicada on Olive Street.</TE>
<TE>   Opening the doors to the restaurant, in the historic Oviatt
Building, we entered an Art Deco world of burnished wood walls and
gold trim, a dining room with majestic sweep and wide-set tables.
Weekends are notoriously deserted in this section of downtown, but
the room had a pleasant buzz.</TE>
<TE>   I started with a green salad, and Paul had the breaded zucchini
salad. Those were followed by a bottle of Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay,
salmon crusted with asparagus on a shallow pool of pureed potatoes
for me, and ahi tuna and sauteed rice with sausage for Paul. We
finished with coffee and shared a plate of buttery cookies. Paul
found his meal too heavy, but my salmon was luscious.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't wander out of the restaurant until 11 p.m., and back at
the Standard, the Nike party was still going strong. Clipboard-toting
security men were at every portal. At the bank of elevators to the
rooms, I was quizzed on my name, room number and number of guests
before I was allowed to pass. It was more amusing than annoying.
After all, I was cool enough to have a room.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday morning I went to the roof for one last look. Bikini-clad
sunbathers moved languidly around the infinity pool to soft Brazilian
music. It was as if Miami's South Beach had been suspended high above
the deserted streets.</TE>
<TE>   I moved on to a bleak industrial swath of downtown where artists
have lofts and studios on Traction Avenue. At the Gourmet Coffee
Warehouse, I bought an iced scone and a latte, found a table outside
and enjoyed the balmy breeze.</TE>
<TE>   Local artists gather regularly on Sunday mornings. I mentioned to
one of them that I had been at the Standard before moving onto
Traction. "Wow, you're really slumming," Ted Meyer teased. I had
hoped to catch one of the sporadic tours of artists' lofts, but the
timing was off. (Artists who live in the Brewery complex are hosting
one of the big events, ArtWalk, on Oct. 12 and 13. The Web site is
www.breweryart.org.)</TE>
<TE>   This Sunday, conversation was enough. I browsed the inviting Form
Zero Architectural Books and Gallery next door, then headed home.</TE>

<LD>Birds like it. Businesses do too. That explains why Ormond Beach has
been the scene of a long struggle between conservationists and
developers.</LD>
<LD>   People committed to preserving an extensive salt-marsh ecosystem
have been pitted against coastal industrialists and Oxnard developers
who are eager to build homes.</LD>
<LD>   Fortunately for wildlife, the Coastal Conservancy has been
purchasing land along the Ormond shoreline.</LD>
<TE>   In 2000 the conservancy acquired 600 acres from Southern
California Edison, and a couple of months ago the state agency got
approval to buy 265 acres of wetlands behind Ormond Beach. Plans are
to add Ormond Beach to a wetlands preserve (in need of restoration)
extending about nine miles from Point Mugu to Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Some proud locals refer to Ormond Beach as "the jewel of Oxnard."</TE>
<TE>   More objective beachgoers might not be so kind. The beach is
backed by a paper mill, a sewage treatment facility and a huge power
plant as well as a marsh that's a mess.</TE>
<TE>   Jewel or not, Ormond Beach has potential. Even in its current
state, the wetlands offer habitat for dozens of bird species,
including rare ones such as the least tern, western snowy plover and
California brown pelican.</TE>
<TE>   The best place for such birds--and those who like to watch
them--is a freshwater lagoon fed by agricultural runoff and ground
water. Ecologists intend to restore the Ormond wetlands' water
supply, which has been compromised for more than a century by dams
and diversions.</TE>
<TE>   But Ormond Beach offers more than a promise of things to come.
It's a fine beach walk, and explorations of sand dunes and marsh
habitats will reveal rare birds and plants.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: You can start walking the three-mile
stretch of Ormond Beach from either end. To start from the beach's
north end, take California Highway 1 to the Hueneme Road exit, just
south of Oxnard. Drive west on Hueneme Road for about five miles,
until you see a turnoff for Port Hueneme Beach Park. The park has
water, restrooms, picnic tables, a pier and parking (for a fee).</TE>
<TE>   To start at the beach's south end, follow the same directions but
stay on Hueneme Road for only a couple of miles. Turn left (south) on
Arnold Road and follow it to the section of Ormond Beach bordering
the Point Mugu Naval Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   A separate route loops around the wetlands. Drive on Hueneme Road
as though you're going to Port Hueneme Beach Park, but half a mile
before the park turnoff, make a left on Perkins Road. Continue south
to the road's end and a parking area.</TE>
<TE>   The hikes: Let's assume you're starting the beach walk from
Ormond's north end, at Port Hueneme Beach Park and its pier.</TE>
<TE>   Leave behind the surfers and sunbathers and head south down Ormond
Beach, walking along the surf line or on a parallel path slightly
inland, alongside the marsh.</TE>
<TE>   Three miles from the pier, you will reach the end of the public
beach at Arnold Road and the Point Mugu naval station.</TE>
<TE>   The separate wetlands trail head has a view of the Hueneme
drainage channel.</TE>
<TE>   Footbridges on the north and south end of the channel allow you to
loop around a part of the wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   Look for coots patrolling the lagoon, plus other waterfowl, native
and migratory. Note that the waterways run parallel to the shore and
thwart access to Ormond Beach.</TE>

<HD>Lakeside in the High Sierra</HD>
<DH>Thick pine forests and crystal blue waters are all the
frills that Huntington Lake needs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS CURWEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAKESHORE, Calif.</DL>
<LD>After five hours of driving, night had finally caught up with us.
Through the forest we caught glimpses of the lake and the flames of
campfires, and by the time our high beams fell on our turnoff, we
were ready to collapse. We unpacked the car and walked down to the
dock. Huntington Lake, this unexpected gem in the middle of the High
Sierra, lay before us, dark and still beneath the stars.</LD>
<LD>   It had been a spur-of-the-moment getaway, and we had been running
late all day. We'd packed the car and left Los Angeles in a blur:
Interstate 5 to Highway 99. We turned right at Fresno and hit the
mountains head-on. It was the middle of August last year, and we were
feeling the dog days of summer.</LD>
<LD>   As we drove north, fighting the monotony of the Central Valley, my
wife, Margie, and I listed the things we might do during the week
ahead--swimming and sailing, hiking and fishing. But that night in
our cabin, a bottle of Merlot and a deck of cards between us, we knew
this vacation would be a success if we did absolutely nothing.</LD>
<TE>   This is what a summer vacation in the mountains is all about. Be
it the clarity of the air, the cool nights or the warm days, the
atmosphere casts a spell that can derail the best-laid plans. I was
no stranger to the seduction. Blame childhood vacations, summer camp
and a few backpacking trips for my susceptibility. My favorite
destination was Huntington Lake, a blue pinprick in the Sierra
National Forest 70 miles east of Fresno, just south of Yosemite
National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington may not have the star power of Lake Tahoe, the
prettiness of nearby Bass Lake or the convenience of Big Bear Lake.
Four miles long by half a mile wide, it is a little scruffy, and it
doesn't get as many visitors as some lakes. But for us, this is the
appeal. There are no big resorts here, no fast-food restaurants or
fancy eateries, no deafening powerboats and Ski-Doos. This is a
no-frills kind of escape, reminiscent of a bygone era. At 7,000 feet,
surrounded by dark green forests, granite domes and peaks, it is just
short of heaven.</TE>
<TE>   When the sun rose the day after our arrival, the sweet indolence
of a morning without an alarm took over. I filled the percolator with
water (no automatic drip machines here), lighted the propane stove
and stepped outside to remind myself what this world looked like in
sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   We were staying on the quiet southwest corner of the lake at
Lakeview Cottages, a collection of 11 small, comfortable cabins,
desirable for their location at the end of the road. Surrounded by
tall red firs, the cabins were built almost 100 years ago and have
been progressively upgraded. All have porches facing the lake.</TE>
<TE>   The cabins, open from Memorial Day to Sept. 30,
weather permitting, are owned by Southern Californian Walter Krudrow,
but their daily operation during the summer months is handled by
Jayne and Denny Mann. They not only organize activities, ranging from
a pancake breakfast to a scavenger hunt for kids, but also maintain
the all-important waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   Because Huntington Lake is a popular destination with limited
lodgings--only four resorts are open during the summer--it is a good
idea to reserve well ahead. Lakeview Cottages takes bookings two
years in advance. When Margie and I heard this, we despaired of ever
getting a cabin. But the Manns are efficient and call immediately
with news of a cancellation. When the phone rang three days after our
initial call, we thought we were lucky, but we were told such luck is
not uncommon.</TE>
<TE>   Ours was a spotless one-bedroom, one-bath cabin. It had white
batten-board walls and linoleum floors. The cabins have plenty of hot
water, showers, refrigerators and enough pots, pans, plates and
utensils for a family of four. We'd brought a week's worth of
groceries, stopping in Visalia. Jayne had recommended that we bring
table lamps for reading at night; the cabins are starkly lighted by
single ceiling bulbs.</TE>
<TE>   Although the lake has some rustic places to eat, we chose to fix
our own meals. The local coffee shops serve hearty breakfasts and
cook up burgers, fish 'n' chips and the like for lunch. Some have
patios facing the lake. Near Lakeshore, the official hub of lake
activity, a few places serve dinner, mostly mountain-style fare
(pan-fried trout, chops, New York steak).</TE>
<TE>   After breakfast--and nothing compares with frying bacon and
brewing your coffee in the mountains--we went on a walk. A trail
wraps around the lake through a wilderness of red firs and lodgepole
pines, ferns and bracken. Overhead the breeze soughed through the
needles. To our left, the lake rose from the shore like a landscape
painted by Cezanne.</TE>
<TE>   For the first few days we were no more ambitious than this. Away
from phones, computers and interruptions, we watched the shadows of
trees clock from west to east, smelled sap warming in the sun and
listened to the silence, a luxurious emptiness broken only by the
distant slap of a screen door, children counting in a game of
hide-and-seek or the splash of someone diving into the lake.</TE>
<TE>   When we felt adventurous, we took beach chairs to a deserted cove,
read in the sun and swam in the icy clear water. Later we explored
the woods near our cabin, field guide in hand, identifying wolf
lichen, manzanita, larkspur and penstemon, and in the evening, we
barbecued steak or hamburgers and got to know another family who has
been coming to Lakeview Cottages for years. Their ski boat was tied
to the dock, and this year they had brought a sailboard with them.
They welcomed us around their fires and passed along a few favorite
activities: They recommended a drive into the back country over
9,175-foot Kaiser Pass and into the Vermilion Valley, where there are
two other dammed lakes that feed into Huntington. Or we could take a
dip at Mono Hot Springs, also in the Vermilion Valley.</TE>
<TE>   We decided not to take that drive; smoke from a forest fire had
drifted into this part of the Sierra, obscuring the views. Instead we
explored the lake. Just around the corner from the cottages is a
wonderful picnic spot: Dowville, as it's called, looks east across
the long expanse of water toward China Peak and Kaiser Pass.</TE>
<TE>   We drove by several picturesque campsites, some at the edge of the
lake. Tall pines shaded tents and campers. Swimsuits and towels hung
from impromptu clotheslines, and smoke rose from a few campfires. The
sites book fast, especially on weekends, when Fresno residents escape
the sweltering summer heat down below.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped in the Forest Service's Eastwood Visitor Center, where
a bulletin board was covered with photographs of the damage bears
have inflicted on trash cans, ice chests and large late-model
automobiles. It is an effective reminder that the California black
bear is alive and well in the region. The ranger attributed the
incursions to overpopulation and natural foraging. The bears, we were
told, are shy and usually take to the hills when confronted with a
clanging skillet and spoon.</TE>
<TE>   We also spent an hour at the Billy Creek Guard Station Museum,
learning about the lake and the fabled flight of a B-24 Liberator.
The story of the 1943 crash of this World War II bomber is the stuff
of campfire legends; its fuselage was found not far from the cove
where we swam. Having developed hydraulic failure in a winter storm,
the plane circled the mountains until its pilot found what he thought
was a snow-covered meadow. It was instead the frozen lake.</TE>
<TE>   Two crew members parachuted to safety; six others perished.
In 1955, when the lake's water level was lowered for dam repairs, the
tail of the plane rose above the water and a recovery was attempted.
Because the lake is nearly freezing at the bottom, the bodies of the
airmen in their leather flight suits were intact.</TE>
<TE>   Later that afternoon we rented a 16-foot sailboat from the small
marina just across the lake from our cabin. As the boat was being
rigged for us, we poked around the general store, which was stocked
with fishing gear: The lake is popular with anglers eager to hook
rainbow trout, German brown trout or kokanee. The store also had a
supply of candy, cheap paperbacks and--shades of the '50s--graham
crackers, marshmallows and Hershey bars for s'mores.</TE>
<TE>   It was a beautiful afternoon for a sail. Huntington has long been
regarded as one of the finest sailing lakes in California. Not only
are the afternoon winds brisk and challenging, but most power boaters
avoid it. They find that the lake is too choppy.</TE>
<TE>   Gliding across the water, we tacked downwind past one of the dams,
the spillway and its gatehouse, past the dense forests on the
southern shore and the posh cabins on the opposite side. The return
trip was wet and cold.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred years ago, our afternoon junket would have been
impossible. Huntington Lake, once a cattle station in a long valley
cut by a river called Big Creek, was the dream of John S. Eastwood.</TE>
<TE>   An engineer with the Pacific Light &amp; Power Co., Eastwood in 1902
started surveying the surrounding watershed of nearly 1,100 square
miles and embarked on a technological feat that in its day was
rivaled only by the Panama Canal.</TE>
<TE>   Built over 50 years, Eastwood's project would include the
construction of six dams and 43 miles of tunnels--driven through
granite--that would drop water collected in the back country more
than 6,000 feet and drive turbines and generators to create
electricity for the fledgling metropolis of Los Angeles, 300 miles to
the south. Henry Huntington, the railroad magnate and major
bankroller for the lake, purchased his fair share of that electricity
to drive the Pacific Electric Red Cars, the trolley line that once
coursed across Los Angeles. Today the vitality of Eastwood's
dream--and his arrogance--is undiminished. The dams, tunnels,
penstocks and power grid are owned and maintained by Southern
California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood's project didn't tame this part of the Sierra, though;
these mountains are as wild as ever. Head over to the D&amp;F Pack
Station, just west of Lakeshore, and go out on an hour, half-day or
full-day horseback ride. You will find yourself on a narrow trail
rising above the lake and soon disappearing in a world of crags,
meadows and dizzying views. There are several hiking trails--the
Eastwood Visitor Center has guidebooks and maps--that might inspire
you to lace up your Vibram-soled boots. Within an hour or two you
will have found yourself a private spot to picnic beside a stream or
some quiet mountain glade.</TE>
<TE>   One favorite destination is Rancheria Falls, a mile hike up
Rancheria Creek on a paved trail. For the more ambitious, there is
the hike to Nellie Lake, a 10-mile round trip in the Kaiser
wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   We were content to spend our time on the water. That evening,
after the wind had died down, we ventured out onto the lake again,
this time in a rowboat rented from the Manns. There, in the middle of
it all, we sat quietly, listened to the occasional splash of a fish
jumping after flies and watched the sunset splash lavender on the
peaks.</TE>
<TE>   This trip was something of a homecoming for me. Before leaving,
Margie and I had pulled out a Super 8 movie, since converted to
video, of a vacation my family had once taken here. Looking at the
frames, I couldn't help but feel estranged from the world they
depicted. Perhaps that is why I most needed this vacation.</TE>
<TE>   It was the early 1960s. There was my father with his buzz cut; my
mom with an assortment of hats; my sister, Sally; my brother, Bob; me
and Sheba, our black Lab, all piled into a green Ford station wagon,
a homemade sailboat tied to the roof. We had set out to explore this
golden state: Mt. Lassen one year, Mammoth the next, then Yosemite
and, finally, Huntington.</TE>
<TE>   Years later I had gone to summer camp here and learned how to
horseback ride, water ski and sail. At night I lay on my back and
watched satellites arc across the sky and, one evening, on a
television rigged up in the dining hall, saw Neil Armstrong step into
the Sea of Tranquillity. Who we were and what we dreamed back then
seemed a nostalgic reverie, and I wondered if the children who
toasted marshmallows for s'mores today would have that feeling 30
years from now.</TE>
<TE>   Later that evening I stepped off the porch of our cabin--Margie
was making our reservations for next year--and let my eyes adjust to
the darkness. The moon was setting. Steam rose from a quenched
campfire. As voices bid good night, I watched squares of light from
the windows of other cabins go dark.</TE>

<HD>Reserving at a National Park? Know Your Source</HD>
<DH>Some Web sites seem to represent the park service or its
concessionaires but actually link to companies that charge hefty
fees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internet site for "National Park Reservations" I logged onto last
week looked official. It had pictures of park scenery and lodges and
listed a toll-free number that offered this recorded message: "Thank
you for calling National Park Reservations. Your call may be
monitored for quality assurance. Please remain on the line, and a
reservation specialist will be with you momentarily."</LD>
<LD>   But this is not the Web site or phone of the National Park Service
or any of its concessionaires. Instead it's a Montana-based business
that charges customers 10% of the room cost to make a reservation at
national park lodges--a service that major lodges at the most popular
parks provide for free (or nearly free, if you count phone charges).</LD>
<LD>   There are many similar Web sites, often linked to one another,
with official-sounding addresses like www.parkreservations.com,
www.americanparks.net and www .yellowstoneres.com. Some charge
reservation fees; others don't. Some don't even book lodges within
the parks, only in nearby communities.</LD>
<TE>   All share a common trait: They can be mistaken for the Internet
sites of the park service or its concessionaires.</TE>
<TE>   "We're constantly being confused with other Web sites ... that
make people think they are talking to us," says Judi Lages,
Denver-based vice president of sales and marketing for Xanterra Parks
&amp; Resorts (formerly Amfac), an official concessionaire that contracts
with the park service to run lodges at seven national parks,
including the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Stolling, reservations manager for Yosemite Concession
Services, which runs lodging at Yosemite National Park, reports
similar confusion among customers.</TE>
<TE>   Operators of such Web sites say they aren't trying to deceive
people and that they are providing a service, worth the fee, for
frustrated customers who don't know which concessionaire to call for
reservations or can't get through the parks' clogged phone lines.</TE>
<TE>   They have a point about the frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Booking a room can be daunting. About 70 companies, each with its
own phones and Internet sites, contract with the National Park
Service to run lodges at various parks. A few big ones, such as
Xanterra and Philadelphia-based Aramark Parks &amp; Resorts, run lodges
at several parks. Many more operate at only one or two parks,
according to the National Park Hospitality Assn., a Washington, D.C.,
trade group for concessionaires.</TE>
<TE>   The easiest way to find the official lodge concessionaires is to
visit the National Park Service's Web site, www.nps.gov. Click on
"Visit Your Parks," choose a park from the drop-down menu, hit "Go"
and click on the "Lodging" button on the park's page (if it's not
grayed out). You'll find phones and often a link to online
reservations. Phone wait times for the most popular parks can be
lengthy, the concessionaires concede.</TE>
<TE>   You also can call the park service's information line at (202)
208-4747 from 6 a.m. to noon Pacific time Mondays to Fridays. I got
through after about five minutes on a recent Wednesday. Another
option is to call the park directly.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some of the differences I found recently in checking out
some of those "similar but different" Internet sites:</TE>
<TE>   *  The National Park Reservations company mentioned above used
several Internet addresses. Neither the home pages of the two sites I
looked at nor the recorded message on the company's toll-free phone
stated that it is--or is not--an official park service operation. By
clicking on small-type buttons on the Web sites I learned the company
"acts only as a reservation service," and when asked, a phone
reservations agent told me "we're an outside agency."</TE>
<TE>   The recorded message said there's a "10% nonrefundable reservation
fee"; on the Web sites, I had to click on small-type buttons or
scroll to the end of the reservations form to learn that.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Xanterra and other official concessionaires at 15 of
the most popular national parks I contacted generally don't charge a
fee for lodge reservations, although many charge cancellation fees or
keep the first night's room deposit if a customer cancels before the
arrival date. One exception is the Grand Teton Climbers' Ranch at
Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming, which charges a $20 reservation
fee. (The National Park Service doesn't have a rule that governs
reservation fees, officials said.)</TE>
<TE>   Steve Brashear, vice president of National Park Reservations, said
his nearly 2-year-old company, based in Red Lodge, Mont., operates as
a travel agency. Asked whether site visitors might confuse his
company with the park service, he said, "Not in our case.... We're
always upfront."  Xanterra pays the company sales commissions for
booking certain lodges in certain seasons, just as it does other
private travel agencies, Lages said.</TE>
<TE>   *  The home page of another company, www.yellowstoneres .com,
identified itself as "Yellowstone Reservations" and claimed to
represent "the largest selection of lodging in and around Yellowstone
Park." But the three hotels it listed, in West Yellowstone, Mont.,
aren't in the park. When I called the site's toll-free number last
month, one reservations agent said the company doesn't book in-park
lodges anymore because "they seem to be full most of the time," and
another told me park lodges were "a huge pain" and their phones were
"always busy."</TE>
<TE>   After I talked with them, I checked Xanterra's phone and Internet
site for Yellowstone. On the Web, three to seven of the park's nine
lodges showed rooms available on two August weekends I randomly
checked, although all were booked up on several July dates. I got
through by phone after five minutes on hold.</TE>
<TE>   *  The site of a third company, www.parkreservations.com, gave me
pause. Any button I clicked on the home page sent me to various pages
of another site, www.yellow stone.net , which said it charged a "12%
nonrefundable service fee" for reservations and listed six pages of
terms. It appeared to charge a $20 "processing fee" if customers
canceled "before we have had the opportunity to fill the
reservation," among other liberties. It also stated: "We do not make
any commitment to return phone calls for reservations."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to clarify these policies, I called the site's number. A
recording said the phone line was only for cancellations, not to make
reservations or "for information." I left a message anyway and also
e-mailed the company's chief executive. After I left the messages,
the provisions for   the $20 "processing fee" disappeared from the
site.</TE>
<TE>   At the Travel section's press time Tuesday, I was still waiting to
hear back.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently you published several letters pointing out the lack of
political correctness in some of your stories. I would like to add my
support to them. Let's examine your June 23 edition:</LD>
<LD>   The story on the front page ("Peak Season on Chesapeake Bay")
advocates eating crabs. Don't you know that those poor creatures are
cooked alive?</LD>
<LD>   There is a story ("Ensuring a Photo Finish to That Dream Trip,"
Travel Insider) that not only discriminates against travelers too
poor to own a camera but is offensive to those who believe that
taking people's pictures is equivalent to stealing their souls.</LD>
<TE>   The Weekend Escape ("Digging the Scene at an Arizona Ranch")
advocates mistreating animals, in this case, by riding horses.</TE>
<TE>   The article "Getting a New View of Native Lands" advocates
traveling through areas that Native Americans hold sacred.</TE>
<TE>   The Youth Beat column ("An Alternative Universe of Student
Vacations") discriminates against those of us who are no longer
students or young.</TE>
<TE>   "My Best Shot" is a "shot" at those who favor gun control.</TE>
<TE>   And the very name of the section, "Travel," is from the French
word travaille, which means "work," an obvious attempt to further
your leftist political agenda by promoting labor unions.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the number of articles you publish trying to get
Americans to visit and leave their money in foreign countries, I
wonder if you are in cahoots with our enemies who are trying to
destroy our morale and our economy and hoping to bring about an end
to the American way of life.</TE>
<TE>   It is obvious that the best thing any politically correct
red-blooded American who is interested in the outside world can do is
stay home and watch television.</TE>
<TE>   With my tongue firmly in cheek,</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Getting Lost in the Web of Internet Fare Searches" (Travel
Insider, June 9): I tried to use Sidestep and discovered that it
won't work unless you are using a Microsoft Windows-based computer.
The company told me it is working on making the program available to
Macintosh users, but my experience has been that this often doesn't
happen.</LD>

<LD>Readers should be aware that the SafeSit seat belt adjuster mentioned
in the June 9 Gear &amp; Gadgets column has not been tested or approved
by any federal regulatory body and is not an adequate substitute for
a booster seat.</LD>
<LD>   The fact that a child thinks she or he is too big for a booster is
a nuisance but irrelevant. It is the adult's responsibility to ensure
the child's safety. In California, children under 6 years old and
less than 60 pounds must use a booster seat.</LD>

<LD>I enjoyed Karl Zimmermann's article on traveling from Paris to
southern France by train ("Two Rail Ways, Swift and Scenic," June
23). But many readers would have enjoyed learning more about travel
and accommodations options.</LD>
<LD>   We will be traveling second class to Provence on the TGV this
month. Zimmermann described the first-class accommodations without
bothering to comment on second-class arrangements. Perhaps he could
have taken a stroll into a second-class car and provided a
description to the great unwashed.</LD>

<HD>Quebec City Puts on a Royal Welcome</HD>
<DH>European charm is fused with a pioneering spirit. And the
food-- c'est tres bon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY GRANT LECHTMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>QUEBEC CITY</DL>
<LD>With an almost jarring perkiness, the French-speaking waiter, a linen
napkin draped elegantly over one arm, thrust a plate of pungent
escargots past my face as his colleague dashed for the piano and
broke out into a giddy, heavily accented rendition of "Jailhouse
Rock."</LD>
<LD>   It was just another night at the Cafe du Monde in Quebec City,
capital of its namesake Canadian province and a place where the king
lives on--in more ways than one.</LD>
<LD>   With its beautiful, clean tangle of cobblestone streets, graceful
graystone churches nestled within thick ramparts, and nonstop parade
of cozy cafes and bistros, the only walled city in North America
feels like France. But far from an imitation, Quebec is a synthesis,
in the best sense, of old and new--even more so than Montreal, its
sassier sister to the southwest. Quebec has managed to preserve Old
Country charms and the pioneering spirit that was, and still is,
vital to the success of forging a new land.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the innumerable fortress towns of Europe, which trade
chiefly on their colorful pasts, Quebec exudes an energy that is
unmistakably North American. Add this vitality to the traditional
Gallic joie de vivre, plus the sheer drama of the city's location on
a rocky headland called Cap-Diamant, above the mighty 760-mile St.
Lawrence River, and you begin to see that Quebec really is different.</TE>
<TE>   After two visits here to research a guidebook, I was convinced
that as pregnant with the past as the place is, it is also mad about
the present, and that leads to an array of surprises, from outdoor
festivals in the middle of winter to hip hotels and restaurants in
ancient settings--not to mention waiters' smiles as wide as any
you'll find in Southern California. Unlike many other places in the
world right now, being an American here is an asset: Sure, they speak
French, but with a familiar inflection, and when the locals switch to
English, it's usually without a second thought. Plus, the exchange
rate results in savings of about 35% before taxes.</TE>
<TE>   For travelers, the history surrounding Canada's oldest city is its
main allure. Quebec's French origins date from 1608, when Samuel de
Champlain established a fur-trading post near what is now
Place-Royale, at the base of the 300-foot cliffs of Cap-Diamant,
which divide Old Quebec into upper and lower sections. Despite
regular attacks by the British and Native Americans, the capital of
New France flourished. And unlike the American colonists to the
south, Quebecers' allegiance to the French crown was unflinching:
Even today, a statue of Louis XIV stands in Place-Royale. But in 1759
the British laid siege to the lower town with 40,000 cannonballs and
10,000 more firebombs, and before long New France as a political
entity was finished.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a decisive British victory on the Plains of Abraham--an
event replayed almost religiously in museums and multimedia shows
throughout town--Quebec's cultural and linguistic ties to France
never foundered. As stark proof, 95% of the city's 600,000 residents
speak French as a first language, with a robust accent that sounds to
the French like American English does to the British. License plates
in Quebec province read "Je me souviens"--"I remember." And they do:
The fierce loyalty to collective memory led to a referendum in 1995
that would have spelled the secession of Quebec from the rest of
Canada had it passed. It was narrowly defeated. For the time being,
the issue of separatism has receded from the forefront of public
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   The best place to get a perspective on the 3,475-square-mile city
is from Dufferin Terrace. This broad wood walkway straddles the cliff
above the St. Lawrence River and is at base level with the
castle-like, 618-room Chateau Frontenac, rail magnate William Van
Horne's hotel and unofficial symbol of Quebec since its construction
in 1893. Today it is owned by the Fairmont chain. From here the
panorama over the river is nothing short of stunning, and it's easy
to see how Quebec's strategic location was prized by French and
British alike. On any summer afternoon, Dufferin Terrace plays host
to an unorchestrated waltz of families with young children, couples
strolling and a changing roster of performers, from youth choruses to
face-painted jugglers and ventriloquists.</TE>
<TE>   I followed the 2,200-foot-long terrace as it wound east away from
the modern, glassed-in funicular, which, for $1.50, eases visitors
down to the lower part of Old Quebec. (There are stairs for the
nimble.) The walkway skirts the Jardin des Gouverneurs, a small but
atmospheric European-style park notable for the 50-foot obelisk at
its center. It commemorates the Marquis de Montcalm and James Wolfe,
the French and British generals who died in battle on the nearby
Plains of Abraham, known as National Battlefields Park since 1908.
Beyond the park a narrower but no less immaculate path, the Promenade
des Gouverneurs, begins and traces the periphery of the Citadel, an
enormous star-shaped military fort sunk into the Plains of Abraham.
The British built the fort in the 1800s to guard against American
attack. The Americans tried but failed to wrest Quebec from the Brits
in 1775 and once more in 1812.</TE>
<TE>   Like the citadel, Quebec's walls were built by the British on the
site of earlier French fortifications. They extend for three miles
around the Upper Town, punctuated by elaborate stone gates and topped
by an uninterrupted walkway peppered with cannons. Past the walls and
west of the Porte St.-Louis, the city's regal main gate, lies
Parliament Hill, home of Quebec's ornate parliament building and an
enormous ice palace during the annual Carnaval celebration in
February. Parliament Hill's main thoroughfare is the Grande Allee, a
Quebecois answer to the Champs-Elysees lined with stately townhouses
and sidewalk cafes. On my first visit to Quebec last June, I followed
the wall to the far side of the hill, where the Old City meets the
new at the Place d'Youville, and stumbled upon a series of brash
posters of Elvis Presley.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that the most popular show in this fiercely
Francophile town was "The Elvis Story," which stars Martin Fontaine
and packs them into the plush Theatre Capitole five nights a week. As
I enjoyed a mixed berry tart at the adjacent Ristorante Il Teatro, a
hip Italian-inspired restaurant and bar, I heard women crowing in
French over Fontaine's apparently spot-on portrayal of the King.</TE>
<TE>   No great Elvis fan myself, I made a mental bookmark to see the
show on my second visit to Quebec last July, but that fell during the
Summer Festival, with so many performances--about 500--that just
reading the program made me dizzy. The most interesting one I saw was
a concert by Greek chanteuse Angelique Ionatos in the vast courtyard
of the austere Seminaire de Quebec, founded during the French regime
in 1663. Part of the seminary is now given over to the Musee de
l'Amerique Francaise, one of the more worthwhile museums within
Quebec's old walls because of its Romanesque-style chapel and
exhibit, "The Settling of French America."</TE>
<TE>   What my high school history books spent only paragraphs on is
explored here with texture and precision, through dioramas, documents
and even wax figures. The displays reminded me that the French were
every bit as bold and industrious as the British when it came to
colonizing this continent.</TE>
<TE>   With its concentration of buildings from French and British
regimes, many now made over into small inns and restaurants, Quebec's
Upper Town invites lingering. Its refreshing lack of big-city
commercialism carries over to the Lower Town. The funicular at
Dufferin Terrace makes a steep descent into the Quartier
Petit-Champlain, a pedestrian zone that is pretty but perhaps less
than authentic: The buildings are original, but the concentration of
creperies and souvenir shops lends it a manufactured ambience. The
more compelling promenade veers to the left and continues past the
small but strikingly authentic Place-Royale. Even after the British
bombardment in 1759, the stone walls of the houses here remained
standing, and today there is nothing Disneyesque about it.</TE>
<TE>   I followed the slender Rue St.-Pierre west. The street was the
commercial heart of Quebec in the 19th century, and now some of the
city's most exciting new hotels and eateries are interspersed between
the grand facades of banks and insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Those garlicky snails I mentioned at Cafe du Monde, a mainstay of
the neighborhood, were not intended for me but for my French
traveling companion Matthieu Lecroart, who ensured their speedy
disappearance with a quick verdict of "tres bon." Those were two
words I heard a lot in Quebec, which, along with Montreal, is one of
the better places to eat on this continent.</TE>
<TE>   One of my finds was the Bistro du Chef, a restaurant that combines
French innovation with Malibu breeziness. Picture an organic green
salad with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, mustard and fennel seed powder
followed by tender Quebec lamb with parsnips and thyme, served
swiftly on a terrace that backs up to a cool cliff side.</TE>
<TE>   Happily, cuisine du marche--meals made with the freshest
ingredients the market has to offer--has become a fixture at many of
Quebec's restaurants. Chefs are regular visitors at Le Marche du
Vieux Port, a waterfront market in Lower Town, where, from May to
early November, farmers from around Quebec province sell their
produce. During my June visit I noticed an abundance of
luscious-looking red strawberries simply labeled "Ile d'Orleans."</TE>
<TE>   Only 20 minutes north of Quebec City, the Ile d'Orleans has been
known for its fertile soil since 1535, when French explorer Jacques
Cartier made landfall there. On my first excursion to the island, on
a sunny day in June, Matthieu and I pulled over at a roadside fruit
stand for an inspection of the reddest, juiciest strawberries
imaginable--sorry, California--and returned to the city with more
fruit than we thought we could handle.</TE>
<TE>   I had already had enough history and scenery to see why Quebec was
so coveted by kings, but these regal flavors tipped the scales. Now I
covet the place too.</TE>

traveling along the Camino de Santiago, the medieval pilgrims' route

still follow a path that drew thousands--some say millions--at its
peak in the 12th century.</CP>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>My passport is precious to me, from the mug shot on the first page to
the Egyptian visa stamped on the last. It places me in Morocco in
1996, Hong Kong in 1998, New Zealand in 2000 and the Seychelles in
2001. Some years ago I had to send it back to the passport agency to
have more pages added so I could continue to travel and keep my job.</LD>
<LD>   Being widely traveled means I am a serial houseplant killer. It
also means I can't get too attached to home because I don't want to
pine for it when I'm on the road.</LD>
<LD>   Homesickness is a powerful feeling that can intrude on a trip, no
matter how much you want to go. I remember being filled with
excitement about going to camp in the Missouri Ozarks when I was
about 10. I was so miserable there that I called my parents and
moaned into the phone, "I want to come home." They didn't let me.
When I was a girl, travel was as much about learning I loved my home
as about getting away from it.</LD>
<TE>   I rarely feel homesick now, except on extended trips to exotic
places, including a monthlong visit in 1996 to China and in 1997 to
India. In both cases I was fine for the first three weeks,
invigorated by new sights and stimuli. By the last week, I was
counting the days until I could come home.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder whether I could even do a long trip around the world,
though the global wayfarers I know speak of eventually crossing a
threshold after which homesickness abates and they start feeling
rootless, like citizens of the world.</TE>
<TE>   I tend to feel homesick on shorter trips when I'm not thrilled
with the place I'm visiting or have landed in a hotel I don't like.
For this reason, hotel selection is important to me. It doesn't have
to be luxurious, but it must be nice. When I get to stay in fancy
hotels, I never feel homesick. In fact, after I leave them, I miss
the king-size beds, whirlpool tubs and room service I don't have at
home.</TE>
<TE>   I've found antidotes for the kind of homesickness engendered by
unlovely hotels. I make my room feel more familiar by draping a
favorite scarf over a chair, putting a picture of my family on a
bedside table and buying flowers because I always have them at home.
My well-traveled sister feels homesick only when she's ill or not
having fun on the road. Her prescription: Have a stiff drink and go
to bed.</TE>
<TE>   Homesickness is triggered by different things for different
people. My friend Penny Kaganoff has a sensitive nose. Whenever she
passes a lilac bush, it transports her back to Chicago, where she
grew up. To her, homesickness isn't a malady but nostalgia for a
place that may or may not be home. I have little desire to go back to
suburban St. Louis, my birthplace, yet occasionally I find myself
feeling pangs that are like homesickness for places I've only
visited--the English Lake District, the Colorado Rockies or the
historic heart of Naples. But then, looking for a new place to call
home is always in the back of my mind when I travel.</TE>
<TE>   The pull of homesickness can be mysterious, as children's book
author and illustrator Allen Say suggests in "Grandfather's Journey"
(Houghton Mifflin Co., 1993). It is a beautiful picture book about
Say's grandfather, who was born in Japan but lived for a time in
California before moving back to his homeland, because he missed it.
He raised a family and told his grandson stories about America. When
Say grew up, he settled in the U.S., where he raised a family of his
own. But he still gets nostalgic for Japan and goes back to visit. At
the end of "Grandfather's Journey," he says, "The funny thing is, the
moment I am in one country, I am homesick for the other."</TE>
<TE>   Recently I asked Say what homesickness is and whether children are
especially prone to it. "Homesickness is a hunger of the heart, which
gets hungry every time it leaves home," he says. "It affects children
more intensely than it does adults because children's hearts have yet
to be calloused by grown-up appetites."</TE>
<TE>   This year I've spent more time away than usual, for personal and
professional reasons, so I've thought about what it means to have a
home you yearn for. I've missed the comforter on my bed and my
flower-lined balcony. But I've also missed my friends, family and
neighborhood, where my mail carrier and the owner of a cafe I often
walk to know me.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, I've just felt road weary, which is different from
homesick. It has to do with hating the clothes I packed and the need
to get up at 4 a.m. to make yet another plane. Fortunately, I
completely forget road weariness by the time I have to leave on
another trip.</TE>
<TE>   I have wondered if there's something aberrant about my general
immunity to homesickness. In fact, if I have to stay home for more
than two weeks I usually start getting sick of it. Sometimes, driving
around L.A., I'm tempted to check into a hotel instead of going home.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, I have decided that homesickness is a good thing. It's
not just that it teaches us there's no place like home, as Dorothy
discovers in "The Wizard of Oz"--if so, why should I feel homesick
for the English Lakes? When I'm homesick, it reminds me that there's
such as thing as love of place, distinct from love of country, family
or home. It arises when I find places that suit me in some
fundamental, soul-stirring way.</TE>
<TE>   So I often leaf through my passport, just to get homesick all over
again for the places I love.</TE>

<LD>If you would like to see America's first national park at a slower
pace--and from a different angle--this summer, you might enjoy a
canoeing and camping adventure at Yellowstone National Park.
Five-night tours are sponsored by Wilderness Inquiry, a nonprofit
organization.</LD>
<LD>   Two types of trips are planned for late July and early August: one
for adults and the other for families. Adults spend the bulk of their
vacations exploring by canoe. Family adventures usually include two
days of canoeing combined with trips to Old Faithful and other
Yellowstone landmarks. Family trips are scheduled July 29 and Aug.
12. An adults trip is planned July 29.</LD>
<LD>   The trips begin in Grant Village campground, about 20 miles east
of Old Faithful geyser and the park's main visitor center. Paddlers
enter the water at the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake.</LD>
<TE>   Participants travel in 24-foot canoes, designed for use on large
lakes, that hold six to eight people each. Canoeing instruction and a

<HD>Structure in Their Lives</HD>
<DH>Pyramids were built as monuments in ancient cultures around
the world. The Learning Channel visits some.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Egypt may be home to the most famous pyramids, but the new three-hour
Learning Channel documentary "Pyramids, Mummies and Tombs," airing
Sunday, notes that these ancient, mammoth religious structures were
also built in many locations around the world, including China,
Mexico, Peru, Guatemala, Indonesia and the Sudan.</LD>
<LD>   Hosted by mummy expert Bob Brier, who teaches at the C.W. Post
campus of Long Island University, the program examines the
universality of these pyramids and asks: Why did these man-made
structures, which were separated by continents and diverse cultures,
look so similar?</LD>
<LD>   "For us, the answer sort of came out while we were doing the
show," Brier says. And that was: All of these cultures wanted to get
as close as possible to their gods, and the only way to make these
buildings--this was before steel beams or flying buttresses--was to
use pyramidal shapes, enabling the stones to be piled high without
collapsing under their own weight.</LD>
<TE>   The documentary was two years in the making. "We wrote it for a
while first," Brier says. "We like to write the scripts first. It
helps to know what you are doing before you get there rather than
trying to make it up and shoot footage. We visited every single sight
twice--first to look at it and scout it out and see if it is good,
and then when we come with the full crews there were no surprises. It
was quite an undertaking. We went to about 12 countries."</TE>
<TE>   Over the past five years, Brier has become a popular fixture on
the cable outlet. He doesn't see himself as a TV person, though. "I
am an academic," he says. "I haven't given up my day job. I only work
with TLC, and we have done 11 hours of shows before this"--including
a six-hour miniseries called "The Great Egyptians."</TE>
<TE>   "Anything about Egypt and mummies is clearly something that
fascinates people today," says Roger Marmet, vice president of
programming and acting general manager of TLC. "We have gone to that
programming well a number of times and found really great stories.
Rather than telling the same story, we are always finding new angles
and ideas or discovering new sites. I'd say some of our most
successful programs in this area have been with Bob Brier because he
is enthusiastic and he's an incredible conversationalist. He really
is bringing it to life and bringing it down to everyone's level."</TE>
<TE>   One of the aspects of pyramids that amazed Brier during his
travels is that "people would put so much energy and so much
economics into building these big pointy things," he says. "There is
a brief interview in the special with the director of the Egyptian
antiquity service, and he said that in a sense, the pyramids made
Egypt. Once you decided to build a pyramid, you had to have an
architect. You had to have artists. In a sense, it was the tail
wagging the dog."</TE>
<TE>   Though Egyptian pyramids were tombs designed to protect the
pharaohs and their treasures for all eternity, the pyramids of the
Aztec and Mayan cultures in Mexico were used for human sacrifice. At
one point, 20,000 prisoners were killed in just three days. "Over the
long run, it has to be hundreds of thousands," Brier says. "It was
kind of an ethic, a code of honor. You captured prisoners and the
honorable thing to do was to sacrifice them. It went on and on for
hundreds of years."</TE>
<TE>   The documentary also profiles several of the men who created these
pyramids, such as Egypt's Imhotep--who built the first pyramid, the
Step Pyramid of Saqqara--and Hemienu, who designed the Great Pyramid
of Giza. "We know the individuals," Brier says. "There is some
historical record. It's a nice story to match a face with a pyramid."</TE>
<TE>   "Pyramids, Mummies and Tombs" can be seen Sunday at 8 p.m on the
Learning Channel. The network has rated it TV-G (suitable for all
ages).</TE>

<HD>The Early Bird Gets the Spouse</HD>
<DH>India: Child marriage remains prevalent in rural areas
here. 'If I wait for my son to be 21, there will be no girl left for
him,' says one parent.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>CHANDARPUR, India</DL>
<LD>Mamtabai is dazzling in her wedding finery, dressed in a purple sari
and escorted by her uncle and new father-in-law.</LD>
<LD>   She climbs the 200-odd steps up a hill to the Hindu temple in this
village in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. They are
seeking the gods' blessings for her marriage, performed earlier in
the day at the bride's house.</LD>
<LD>   Mamtabai's husband, Ram Kalyan, from the neighboring desert state
of Rajasthan, is already complaining of aching feet.</LD>
<TE>   "Daddy, can't you pick me up? I can't walk anymore," he says. His
bride giggles under her veil: "Big boy can't walk."</TE>
<TE>   Ram is 8 years old, Mamtabai only 6.</TE>
<TE>   They were among thousands of children, some as young as 2, who
took their marital vows recently, honoring a centuries-old tradition
of the legendary Rajput warrior clan in defiance of Indian law. Long
lines of child couples stood outside Hindu temples across north and
central India asking priests for blessings.</TE>
<TE>   The youngsters do not live together until years later.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of the marriage ceremony, the bride and groom return
home to their families.</TE>
<TE>   A few months after a girl reaches puberty, she is taken to the
groom's home with great ceremony and the marriage is consummated soon
after.</TE>
<TE>   India forbids marriage for women younger than 18 and men under 21,
and parents can be sent to jail for up to three months if they are
caught marrying off minors.</TE>
<TE>   But officials mostly ignore the practice in Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan states, where Rajputs comprise nearly two-thirds of voters.</TE>
<TE>   While the practice is dying out among urban, educated Rajputs, it
remains common in rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Fathers want their sons to secure obedient, well-bred girls for
later in life. Hiralal Tawar, the head of Madhapura village in Madhya
Pradesh, says his sons married between the ages of 10 and 13.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the law. But if I wait for my son to be 21, there will be
no girl left for him," Tawar says. "You can't fight centuries-old
tradition with law."</TE>
<TE>   The families of girls say they want their daughters to have
security.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my duty to get my daughter married to the right boy, and if
I delay all the right boys will be married off," says Rupnath Singh,
father of a 5-year-old, Putlibai, who was married in Bankpura
village.</TE>
<TE>   "For a girl in these parts, the only social security is through
marriage. A marriage is the ultimate refuge, protection and security
in a woman's life. The earlier she meets her man, the better."</TE>
<TE>   In Chandarpur, Mamtabai and Ram accept their blessings as the
priest chants, "May you have a fruitful and happy wedded life."</TE>
<TE>   But they're not listening. Their eyes are on the sugar balls kept
on a brass plate as offerings to the deity. When the prayers are
over, they snatch the balls and stuff them in their mouths.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a traditional Indian soldier's attire, with a sword in
hand, Ram wants to have more fun.</TE>
<TE>   "Daddy, pick me up," yells the groom, pointing to brass bells out
of his reach. "I want to ring the bells."</TE>

<HD>School Labs Are Often Experiments in Danger</HD>
<DH>Education: Number of science accidents climbs in wake of
rules for hands-on training.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TAMMY WEBBER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>GENOA, Ill.</DL>
<LD>In a flash, the routine high school chemistry experiment turned to
chaos.</LD>
<LD>   An alcohol-fueled fireball shot into the classroom, searing the
skin of three junior honor students in the front row. They took the
brunt of the blast on their faces, necks, arms, hands and legs.</LD>
<LD>   The teacher pulled burning jeans off one of the girls; scorched
skin fell from the boy's face. The rest of the class scrambled for
the door, leaving burned backpacks and books behind.</LD>
<TE>   The fire at Genoa-Kingston High School last October may have been
a horrible accident, but it was not unique. Across the country, at
least 150 students have been seriously injured in school laboratory
accidents in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   But the number is almost certainly much higher, according to
interviews with researchers, school officials and insurance
companies. And the stage is set for a significant increase, they
said. As schools try to meet tough new science education standards
set by the National Academy of Sciences in 1996, students are
spending more time in laboratories. Some are crowded. Some have
teachers with no safety training. Some are in 19th-century buildings
ill-equipped for 21st-century science.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, most kids were reading out of textbooks, but the new
federal science standards absolutely, strongly, advocate hands-on,
inquiry-based science," said Kenneth Roy, who chairs an advisory
board on science safety for the National Science Teachers Assn. "What
this means is, you have to have safety concerns as job one, but some
schools don't."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers are protected in the workplace by state safety laws, but
students are not. There is little regulation of school labs, and no
government or private agency collects data on accidents that happen
there. As a result, the exact number of accidents is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the accidents and injuries could have been prevented
with simple measures, experts said. But many teachers are unaware of
the dangers, and there is no formal system to share information on
accidents so that teachers can learn from others' mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   But they occur often enough to be considered a serious problem,
according to safety experts and insurers who have paid millions of
dollars to settle claims.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been some terrible accidents and injuries that are
just absolutely gross," said John Wilson, executive director of the
Schools Excess Liability Fund in California, which recently paid more
than $1 million in one case involving a chemistry accident and more
than $3 million in another.</TE>
<TE>   A settlement is pending in a third case involving a Riverside girl
who was burned over 20% of her body. She is getting treatment to
reduce scarring and improve the use of her burned arm.</TE>
<TE>   There is evidence that the number of accidents has risen since
schools began adopting the new teaching standards. In Iowa, there
were 674 accidents in the three school years from fall 1990 through
the spring 1993, but more than 1,000 in the next three years, said
Jack Gerlovich, who teaches science safety at Drake University.</TE>
<TE>   The increase came after Iowa schools began adopting an early
version of the new standards, he said. The number of lawsuits soared
too, from 96 to 245. Gerlovich said he suspects the same thing is
happening in other states.</TE>
<TE>   If accurate statistics were gathered, he said, "I think the actual
numbers would be much, much higher. But it's the kind of problem
nobody wants to face."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the swoosh of fire hit Autum Burton, she was returning to her
seat in her chemistry class after taking a closer look at the colors
of the flames in the six petri dishes on the teacher's table.</TE>
<TE>   In an instant, she was engulfed. "I could feel it eating at me and
I could smell my skin burning," she recalled. "I was on the floor
trying to get this off with my hands."</TE>
<TE>   By the time someone finally managed to wrap her in a blanket and
put out the fire, she was burned over almost half her body: face,
neck, chest, arms and legs.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, 19, now attends Columbia College in Chicago. Despite eight
skin-graft operations and three laser treatments to diminish scarring
on her face, she will be disfigured for the rest of her life.</TE>
<TE>   The accident happened two years ago at Lakeview High School in
Battle Creek, Mich. Just two months earlier, a 16-year-old girl was
severely burned in a similar accident about 40 miles away, at Waverly
High School near Lansing. In both cases, the experiments involved
methyl alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   A volatile chemical that ignites easily, methyl alcohol often is
involved in the most catastrophic accidents. In recent years, it also
has caused flash fires at schools in Santa Clarita and Riverside,
Calif.; here in Genoa; Midland, Texas; New Berlin, Wis., and
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   If the teacher does not use an exhaust system, leaves the cap off
the alcohol jug or pours too much into the dishes, fumes can build up
and, if exposed to flame, create a flash fire. If the fumes come from
an open bottle, the blast can eject the liquid, followed by a
fireball.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a flame-thrower effect," said Steve Weston, a lawyer
representing Burton and the student from Lansing. "It jettisons fluid
from the bottle, whose opening is pointed like a gun right at these
students."</TE>
<TE>   The fire marshal in Battle Creek determined Burton's accident
could have been prevented if an exhaust system in the room had been
used to draw away fumes. And the injuries might have been minimized
if the teacher had used a plastic shield or required the students to
wear goggles.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, school officials believed such protection was
unnecessary when students were watching, rather than participating
in, an experiment, even though most state laws require eye protection
under such circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   But Gerlovich, the Drake University researcher, has found that
more than 70% of North Carolina science teachers had never received
safety training. He said surveys in 17 other states found an average
of 55% to 65% of teachers have never been trained in safety.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Paradise, assistant principal of East Bakersfield High School
in California, said he never imagined students were in danger in the
lab--until a glass bottle of methanol exploded three years ago,
sending a teacher and 22 students to a hospital with cuts, headaches
and nausea. The district began requiring shields and goggles and sent
teachers for training.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of training is alarming for another reason, experts said:
Many teachers don't know how to safely store chemicals, which can
cause dangerous reactions if they accidentally mix. Some teachers
store chemicals alphabetically instead of by chemical type, or keep
them beyond their safe life span.</TE>
<TE>   In Rogersville, Tenn., last March, old, unlabeled bottles of
chemicals being removed from a school accidentally leaked and mixed,
causing an explosion and fire. No one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In Valley, Neb., officials cleaning out a school lab last year
found a canister of picric acid, which crystallizes and becomes
highly explosive with age. When they realized it could be 30 years
old, they called the bomb squad.</TE>
<TE>   Eight months after the Genoa-Kingston flash fire, Rachel Anderson,
Eric Baenziger and Kara Butts are still recovering from their burns.
Kara and Eric wear pressure garments 24 hours a day to reduce
scarring and both will require skin grafts, said their lawyer,
Michael Alesia. The students declined to be interviewed for this
story.</TE>
<TE>   All eventually returned to school. Administrators are trying to
sort out what happened and whether they should change their chemistry
procedures. The teacher was not disciplined and remains on staff,
according to the school's superintendent, Richard Leahy. The teacher
did not respond to a request for an interview, but Leahy said, "No
one agonized more than this man over hurting his students. He's a
retired professional chemist; he teaches because he loves it."</TE>
<TE>   The Genoa-Kingston case illustrates a lack of school safety
oversight--a lack that is common in most states. Laws, if they exist,
are almost never enforced in schools. Aside from eye-protection
requirements, few laws are aimed specifically at students. School
labs rarely undergo inspections from state or federal authorities and
there usually are no requirements that accidents be reported to
anyone outside the school.</TE>
<TE>   "The schools are pretty much left on their own," said James A.
Kaufman, director of the Massachusetts-based Laboratory Safety
Institute, a nonprofit agency that promotes school lab safety. "They
all assume these are smart people, they have a science degree, they
know how to do this properly."</TE>
<TE>   Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules do not
cover local or state employees, and in most states similar workplace
safety laws apply only to employees. There is no OSHA equivalent to
protect students; instead, it is assumed that if laws protect
teachers, students also will be safe, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Illinois Labor Department, for example, investigates school
accidents only if someone reports them, said Al Juskenas, the
department's manager of safety inspection and education. But schools
are only required to report accidents if someone is killed, or if
three or more employees--not students--are injured seriously enough
to go to the hospital. The department investigated the Genoa-Kingston
case because a teacher complained, Juskenas said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think lawmakers need to take another look at things," said Roy
of the National Science Teachers Assn. "But there is a lot on the
books now that needs to be enforced, and teachers need training. You
send your kids to school because you think they're safe. It burns me
that [accidents] are happening when they're preventable."</TE>

<HD>A Trying Time Finding Truth in Small-Town Murder Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Three retarded defendants are accused of killing an
infant. But the baby's very existence is in doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First in a weekly series</LD>
<LD>   BUTLER, Ala.--Victoria Banks' court-appointed lawyers explained
the prosecution's offer to her as best as they could, using the
simplest language. She sat quietly as they laid out her options
across a mahogany law library table.</LD>
<LD>   There are two choices, the lawyers said. We can take the case to
the jury, or we can accept a plea bargain.</LD>
<TE>   There's a good chance we can win, the lawyers said. The police
never found a body. We can argue that you, your sister and your
estranged husband were confused by police questioning--that the
confessions were contradictory and coerced.</TE>
<TE>   But something could go wrong, they continued. You might be sent to
prison for the rest of your life. Or even die in the electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   As they spoke, the lawyers couldn't be sure how much the mentally
retarded woman understood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A trial is all or nothing. The risk is enormous for both sides.</TE>
<TE>   A plea bargain removes risk, replacing it with a compromise that
neither side may like but that both can accept.</TE>
<TE>   We like to think that justice is about finding the truth, but when
defense lawyers and prosecutors weigh whether to risk everything or
play it safe, something essential can be lost.</TE>
<TE>   Did Victoria Banks really kill her baby?</TE>
<TE>   Did the baby ever exist? When defendants -- in this case,
three--are retarded, the truth can be particularly hard to find.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Banks was in the Choctaw County Jail, awaiting trial on another
charge, when she started telling people she was pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   She'd been arrested in October 1998, after teachers found bruises
on her 11-year-old daughter. The girl had been raped by her mother's
new boyfriend, George Bonner. The way police figured it, he told
Banks she wasn't satisfying him and she let him have her child.</TE>
<TE>   At 27 years old, the poor, black mother seemed like a child
herself--quiet, shy, easily manipulated, prone to dissolving into
giggles. She had an IQ of 40, had dropped out of special education in
the ninth grade to have the first of her six children, was cowed by
an abusive boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Experts in retardation and criminal justice disagree about whether
people such as Banks, who have flawed judgment and poor impulse
control, should be held fully culpable for crimes they may commit.
Experts also ask whether reasoning difficulties put retarded
defendants at an unfair disadvantage in dealing with police.</TE>
<TE>   The debate reached a milestone last month when the U.S. Supreme
Court outlawed the death sentence for retarded people. Executing
them, the court decided, neither appropriately punishes the criminal
nor serves as a deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   In early February 1999, after telling guards she'd been missing
her period, Banks was taken to Dr. Roshdy Habib, 74, the jail doctor
for two decades. Banks told Habib she was six months' pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   Habib wanted to do a pelvic exam, but Banks refused. The doctor
examined her abdomen but saw no swelling. When he asked about a scar
on her belly, Banks said she'd had her tubes tied in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Fallopian tubes can spontaneously reattach after a tubal ligation,
but Habib knew it happens rarely--in just one out of 100 cases. He
wrote his conclusion in his records: Banks was faking pregnancy to
try to get out of jail.</TE>
<TE>   But Banks kept telling people she was pregnant, and after a while,
some inmates thought the short, stocky woman was starting to look it.
"She was showing," said Jonathan Rodgers, who was serving time for
burglary.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of church evangelists, who held weekly services at the
jail, saw Banks' body changing too. They prayed with her for the
health of the baby.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, Habib retired, and Dr. Katherine Hensleigh took
over Banks' care. Where Habib saw fakery, Hensleigh saw pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   She measured Banks' abdomen in February and again in March, and
found it consistent with a pregnancy of five or six months. She
attached a heart monitor to Banks' abdomen and picked up a rhythmic
sound distinct from the mother's heartbeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't difficult to hear," she said later, adding that nurses
and Banks heard the heartbeat too.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Donald Lolley did not regard this as good news. Lolley,
who declined to be interviewed for this story but talked to the AP
earlier about the case, thought his jail was no place for a pregnant
woman. Besides, those around him say, he didn't want Choctaw County
footing the obstetrics bill.</TE>
<TE>   Lolley saw to it that Banks' bond was lowered so her mother could
bail her out.</TE>
<TE>   On May 14, 1999, Banks walked out of jail and back into Butler, a
town with one diner, one motel and a Texaco gas station that serves
catfish and chicken-fried steak--all nestled in the woods of western
Alabama. It's home to 1,952 people, roughly split between black and
white, with both races holding elected offices. The country club
recently admitted its first black members.</TE>
<TE>   Banks returned to her job at the chicken plant, more than an
hour's bus ride across the Mississippi state line. That's where
working-class people in Butler go if they can't get a job near home
at the Georgia Pacific paper mill.</TE>
<TE>   She moved into a friend's trailer at the bottom of a dead-end dirt
road on the outskirts of town. It's a neighborhood of trailers,
shacks and hog pens, where her estranged husband, Medell Banks, liked
to hang out all day drinking beer.</TE>
<TE>   It was two months later, in late July, that Lolley happened to
look out his office window and spot Banks strolling from Bill's
Dollar Store across the street.</TE>
<TE>   Her belly was gone.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 3, 1999, Banks sat across from Lolley in a cramped, dimly
lighted office with his old campaign posters hung on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to the baby, the sheriff asked.</TE>
<TE>   Miscarriage, Banks replied.</TE>
<TE>   Lolley didn't believe her.</TE>
<TE>   There isn't much crime in Butler, but in a quarter-century as
sheriff, Lolley had seen a few big cases. This might be one of the
big ones--capital murder.</TE>
<TE>   Lolley held Banks and picked up two of her relatives: Banks'
husband, Medell, and her sister, Dianne Tucker. Like Victoria Banks,
both are mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   Over five days, Lolley and detectives from the Alabama Bureau of
Investigation questioned them, often late into the night, starting up
again the next morning. Between interrogations, the three waited in
their cells, without lawyers to advise them.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators turned on a tape recorder when they thought they
could get something useful. What was said when the tape was off isn't
known for sure.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks says investigators told her, again and again, "You
goin' to the 'lectric chair," but the threat isn't on tape.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators did bluff, according to tape transcripts. "There is
DNA evidence," Lolley told Medell Banks at one point--although there
wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Threats and bluffs are acceptable tactics in police
interrogations. However, experts such as Chris Slobogin, a University
of Florida law professor, say police often underestimate how easily
retarded suspects become confused, how suggestible they are, how
eager most are to please.</TE>
<TE>   As the questioning continued, a contradictory set of stories
emerged. The three suspects were either terribly confused or bad
liars. Nearly every account they gave, the tape transcripts show,
differed from the last.</TE>
<TE>   Victoria Banks was the first to stop insisting there had been a
miscarriage. She gave birth at Tucker's house in neighboring Halsell,
she said, but didn't know if the baby was alive or dead. Tucker's
husband, she said, wrapped the baby in a blue blanket and threw it in
the garbage.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, she changed her story, saying her sister smothered the
infant.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, she told an entirely different story: She gave
birth in an abandoned trailer near where she'd been living. Medell
cut the cord, wrapped the infant in a blue towel or blanket, said not
to worry and walked out with it.</TE>
<TE>   Why, then, had she said her sister had killed the baby, police
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I thought she was there," Victoria Banks said. "I had
pictured in my mind that she was there, and then I stopped and
thought last night, it wasn't her."</TE>
<TE>   In various accounts, Victoria Banks said:</TE>
<TE>   * That she very much wanted the baby--and that she didn't want it
because the father was the man who had raped her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   * That she watched the baby being born--and that she passed out
and didn't remember the birth.</TE>
<TE>   * That her sister, Diane Tucker, helped with the delivery--and
that Tucker wasn't there at all.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Tucker was talking too. The baby was born at her home, she
said. She suffocated it with a yellow towel and went with her husband
to bury it in a ditch. Before long, she changed part of her story,
saying she and her husband left the body for the coyotes and snakes.</TE>
<TE>   By the third day of questioning, Tucker was saying the baby wasn't
born at her place at all. The birth occurred in an abandoned trailer,
she said. Medell Banks took the baby away and returned an hour later
empty-handed. She'd lied before, she said, because she was afraid of
Medell.</TE>
<TE>   Medell Banks denied knowing anything about the baby. Police tried
baiting him, suggesting he was angry with his wife and her boyfriend
about the pregnancy. But he remained steadfast.</TE>
<TE>   On the day police thought the baby was delivered, he was drunk as
usual, Medell Banks said. He couldn't remember anything.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, police asked whether he had heard a baby cry, and
Medell Banks agreed that he had. But moments later, he denied even
being present. Victoria's story--the one about him cutting the
cord--couldn't be true, he said, because he wouldn't know how to do
that.</TE>
<TE>   Police tried another approach; they took Medell Banks to the
trailer and asked him to help find the body. Nothing came of it.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators combed the area for days, tramping through swampy
woods with a dog trained to search for cadavers. They picked through
trash in the trailer. They also looked in Halsell, in and around
Tucker's home.</TE>
<TE>   But they found no body.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators carted away sofa cushions, a mattress, sheets and a
shovel for analysis, but lab work turned up no blood or other
physical evidence of a murder--or even of a birth.</TE>
<TE>   No one in any of the nearby trailers came forward to say they had
seen or heard a baby.</TE>
<TE>   Still, police continued to hold the three suspects.</TE>
<TE>   About two weeks after his arrest, still without a lawyer, Medell
Banks told the sheriff a new story. Tucker killed the baby and asked
him to get rid of it, he said, so he put it in a hole across the
road.</TE>
<TE>   But later, he returned to denying knowing anything at all.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, little seemed certain.</TE>
<TE>   Had Victoria Banks faked her pregnancy to get out of jail, as one
doctor thought?</TE>
<TE>   Could she have had a hysterical, or "false" pregnancy?</TE>
<TE>   Had she overcome 100-1 odds and become pregnant despite her tubal
ligation, as another doctor thought?</TE>
<TE>   If so, might she have miscarried?</TE>
<TE>   Might the child have been born dead?</TE>
<TE>   Or was the child born alive and then murdered?</TE>
<TE>   And if so, by whom?</TE>
<TE>   It fell to Dist. Atty. Bobby Keahey, elected straight from law
school 15 years earlier, to make sense of it all.</TE>
<TE>   Keahey had no body, no physical evidence, no consistent accounts
from witnesses--and no doubt about what to do.</TE>
<TE>   Next week: "I'm getting ready to say I'm guilty for something I
didn't do."</TE>

<HD>School Projects Fight the Bad Rap on Bats</HD>
<DH>Wildlife: The flying rodents are endangered by the
blood-sucking reputation of one breed. Researchers try to counter
that in the classroom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK STEVENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Even as swarms of monarch butterflies flutter back to the United
States from their winter home in Mexico, another less-loved but
equally large migration has winged its way north: tens of millions of
Mexican bats.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. schoolchildren fascinated by the orange-and-black butterflies
might not go quite so gaga over a wrinkle-nose little flying rodent
like the Mexican free-tail bat, now summering in caves and under
bridges in a broad stretch from California to Louisiana.</LD>
<LD>   But the bats' migration is perhaps just as endangered as the
monarchs' -- even though bats more directly benefit human beings by
eating thousands of tons of agricultural pests and keeping the desert
blooming. They even help make tequila.</LD>
<TE>   The bats' annual October-April migration -- the same schedule as
the butterflies' -- contains marvels similar to the monarchs, whose
successive generations manage to find their way back year after year.</TE>
<TE>   For example, using just chirps and smells to guide her, a mother
bat can quickly locate her baby on a cave ceiling crowded with as
many as 20 million other bats, while many humans have trouble finding
their kids at the shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   Bats are already becoming a class project at some schools in
Mexico, much as monarch breed-and-release programs are in the United
States. About 100 million butterflies winter here, and about the same
number of bats.</TE>
<TE>   So why the difference in treatment? Both suffer. The monarch is an
indirect victim of deforestation. Loggers are cutting down the fir
trees it prefers.</TE>
<TE>   But for decades, Mexico's bat caves -- once some of the world's
largest -- have intentionally been burned out, bulldozed, poisoned,
filled in or covered up. Farmers sometimes set tires alight, and roll
them into caves to smoke out bats.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is truly and simply one of human perceptions," said
Rodrigo Medellin, a biologist and foremost bat researcher at the
Autonomous University of Mexico, referring to the bat's poor
reputation.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is the unfortunate overlap of habitat in Mexico between
vampire bats -- which don't migrate to the United States -- and the
insect-eating, people-shy free-tail bat, which gets blamed for the
vampires' attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "A rancher sees vampire bite marks on his cattle, and he goes
after the most visible group of bats around, which is almost always a
group of non-vampire bats, like the free-tails," Medellin said.</TE>
<TE>   Vampires are secretive, and roost in small groups of 50 to 100,
while other bats nest in groups as large as several million.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up to a bad rap for the bats.</TE>
<TE>   "When we go into classrooms and ask children what image they have
of bats, they almost all say things like, 'They're ugly. They suck
your blood. They're the devil's messengers. They should be killed,' "
said Maria Luisa Franco, an educator who works for the Migratory
Mammal Conservation Program.</TE>
<TE>   Using bat games and smiling storybook characters like Marcelo, a
nectar-eating bat, and Valentin, a vampire, Franco and her team try
to dispel some of the myths and inform children about the useful
functions of bats.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike monarch class projects, however, Franco is careful to tell
children they shouldn't enter bat caves or handle bats. And as part
of a community outreach program, adults are told how to safely poison
vampires.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a trade-off," said Steve Walker, who, as executive director
of Austin, Texas-based Bat Conservation International helps sponsor
the education program and would rather not see any bats killed. "But
when you look at the effect [of vampires] on other bat species, it's
worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Even the tequila industry wants to join the conservation effort,
in part to make up for past sins. The link between tequila and bats
is found in the endangered long-nosed bat, which is the main
pollinator of cactus and agave along its migratory route to the U.S.
Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   "Bats are intimately connected to the tequila industry," said
Ramon Gonzalez, director of Mexico's tequila council. But in the face
of the newfound popularity of the drink, farmers of agave are
expanding acreage with plants the bats can't eat.</TE>
<TE>   The long-noses stop at flowering cactuses to eat nectar along
their migration, thus spreading pollen from one plant to another,
increasing their genetic diversity.</TE>
<TE>   But to catch the distillable sugar that is the heart of tequila,
producers have to harvest agaves just before they flower, thus
reducing the bats' food source. Instead of naturally pollinated
plants, farmers use farm- or laboratory-produced seedlings,
descendants of just a few plants.</TE>
<TE>   Bat advocates are pressing farmers to let just a few agaves flower
in each field.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to let the agave flower, but then you lose that plant. It
has no commercial value," Gonzalez said. "We would be quite willing
to let some plants flower, but we need to know how many are needed to
sustain the bats. We need someone to do a study."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the bat advocates have had some successes.</TE>
<TE>   Consider La Boca Cave, in northeast Mexico, a couple of hundred
miles south of the U.S. border. It was once home to an estimated 25
million free-tail bats in the 1960s. The largest current colony, in
Bracken Cave near San Antonio, Texas, holds about 20 million.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1990s, the population at La Boca had dwindled to
about 100,000, largely due to vandalism. Teenagers would enter the
cave with flashlights, bonfires, or firecrackers, or pelt the
bat-crowded ceiling with rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Such disturbances cause waves of young bats to fall to the floor,
where the carnivorous beetles that live in such caves reduced them to
skeletons in a matter of minutes.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of bat-education programs, the La Boca colony
started to revive, reaching about 350,000 in 1996 -- when Latin
America was hit by a wave of reports of a mythical bloodsucking
animal, the Chupacabra, literally "the Goat Sucker."</TE>
<TE>   The Chupacabra was variously described by those who had "seen" it
as a kangaroo or turkey with claws, an alien or a panther-like beast.
Still, although they didn't fit the description, bats paid the price.</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, several adults went to La Boca Cave to wipe out
the evildoers, the supposed Chupacabras.</TE>
<TE>   But they were met at the mouth of the cave by a group of
youngsters who had done a classroom project on bats.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids stopped them," said Medellin, the bat researcher. "They
told them about the positive aspects of bats, what kind of bats lived
there, and they talked them out of killing them."</TE>
<TE>   It all causes a kind of feeling seldom associated with bats: "It
made my heart glow," Medellin said.</TE>

<HD>Austrian Town Struggles to Cope With Its Links to a Young
Hitler</HD>
<DH>History: The Nazi leader lived in Leonding just six years,
moving at age 15. But when his house was deemed a hazard, a feud
erupted over what to do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEORGE JAHN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>LEONDING, Austria</DL>
<LD>Word is spreading: Hitler lived here.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, few people outside Leonding knew the Nazi dictator
spent his boyhood in this picture-pretty town near the west Austrian
city of Linz. In a country still struggling to own up to its past,
Leonding would have preferred to keep its connection to Adolf Hitler
out of the public eye.</LD>
<LD>   But this year, the house where Hitler lived for six years until
age 15 was becoming a safety hazard and a decision had to be made: to
renovate it or tear it down? That, in turn, spawned a painful
dispute.</LD>
<TE>   Some in the town of 22,000 wanted the empty house designated as a
memorial to infamy, while others demanded it be razed. Both ideas
were too radical for Mayor Herbert Sperl, a self-described man of
consensus.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he got the town council to approve a plan to renovate the
house, leave it unidentified and use it to warehouse coffins for the
nearby cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   "Rededicating it for this function is one way of making sure
Hitler isn't being glorified," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Although renovation work already has begun, others remain opposed.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that other buildings--Hitler's birthplace in
Braunau to the west and a school he attended in Fischlham to the
south--display memorials or plaques condemning his crimes against
humanity. And most Austrians today acknowledge that their country was
not only a victim but a perpetrator during the Nazi era.</TE>
<TE>   "I suggested that we should make it a monument, a memorial to the
millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust," says Dr. Claudia
Mueller-Wechselberger, 42, a physician at the local hospital.
"Turning the house into something it never was won't change history.</TE>
<TE>   "It's time people here stopped turning away and started facing
facts: Hitler lived here, among us."</TE>
<TE>   In March she wrote to the regional newspaper, the
Oberosterreichische Nachrichten, complaining that the estimated
$300,000 cost of renovation would be better spent turning the
building into a memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction was quick--and in some cases scary. People accused her of
casting their community in a negative light by publicizing its links
to Hitler.</TE>
<TE>   "I started getting anonymous calls, nasty cursing," she says.
"Some of them asked if I had children."</TE>
<TE>   A town councilwoman stopped greeting her. So did neighbors, and
"one of them said that if I ever write another letter to the paper, I
should make sure I don't list my address again," Wechselberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Hitler was born in Braunau, on the German border, and lived there
until age 3.</TE>
<TE>   As Germany's fuehrer, he paid triumphant visits to Braunau,
Leonding and other boyhood haunts after Nazi Germany absorbed Austria
in 1938.</TE>
<TE>   Although Braunau's "Hitler House" long been has used as a workshop
for the mentally disabled, it remains a place of pilgrimage for
admirers and a venue for anti-Nazi demonstrators.</TE>
<TE>   Gerhard Skiba, mayor of the town of 16,000, says Braunau's
reputation as Hitler's birthplace is an eternal burden all its
residents must bear.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas Dorn-Fussenegger, a member of the environmentalist Green
Party, was one of only two of Leonding's nine councilors who voted
against the mayor's plans.</TE>
<TE>   His suggestion: Identify the house for what it was--Hitler's home
until 1904--and put up a mirror next to the sign "so that the visitor
can see himself and recognize that the intolerance that led to the
Holocaust begins with the little man."</TE>
<TE>   Opposed was the rightist Freedom Party of Joerg Haider, whose past
praise of some Nazi-era policies and disparaging comments about Jews
prompted the European Union to impose temporary sanctions on Austria
when the party joined the government coalition two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom Party Councilman Horst Wagenhofer says he would have
preferred to "drag the house down rather than make it a magnet for
leftist liberals and their graffiti."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Hitler's shadow is bound to go on looming over
Leonding.</TE>
<TE>   In the cemetery beside the house, his mother, Klara, lies in a
grave by her husband, Alois, surrounded by burned-out stumps of
votive candles that attest to frequent visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Cemetery workers and passers-by shrug and profess their ignorance
when asked who visits the graves. But at least one is not afraid to
speak her mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad someone is taking the time to treat their memory with
respect," said Ilse Maier, 55.</TE>
<TE>   As for Hitler, she said, "It's good that he lived here."</TE>

<HD>Thailand's 'Mr. Clean' Aims to Sweep Out Sleaze</HD>
<DH>Government: Interior minister's one-man campaign to restore
traditional values gets cheers and jeers. His success is in doubt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENIS D. GRAY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BANGKOK, Thailand</DL>
<LD>For Interior Minister Purachai Piumsombun, a night on the town often
means bursting into a bar or disco to round up young drunks, conduct
urine tests on suspected drug users and punish corrupt cops for
failing to enforce the law.</LD>
<LD>   The raids are part of Purachai's "new social order," virtually a
one-man campaign to restore traditional Thai values and rein in a
huge sex-and-drugs empire controlled by the powerful and abetted by
corrupt authorities.</LD>
<LD>   In a society known for bending the rules, the former policeman and
devout Buddhist is attempting to limit entertainment areas and close
down spots that stay open past 2 a.m. or admit those younger than 20.</LD>
<TE>   Launched last year, the minister's efforts are drawing cheers from
parents who see their children drawn into the often dangerous night
scene. But critics say his ideas smack of social engineering and
authoritarianism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's on the right road in helping Thailand. He's an
honest man, a man of principle. Present-day Thailand needs such a man
to remedy its sickness," says a veteran human rights lawyer who is
also a senator, Thongbai Thongbao. "But I am not sure he will
succeed. He stands alone."</TE>
<TE>   Succeed or fail, Purachai stands out in bold relief on Thailand's
political scene. The 1 1/2-year-old government of Prime Minister
Thaksin Shinawatra is widely criticized for scandals, cronyism and
putting private business interests ahead of national ones.</TE>
<TE>   A telecom tycoon, Thaksin himself narrowly escaped ouster from
politics on charges that he knowingly concealed his assets while
serving in a previous government.</TE>
<TE>   Commentators point out that Purachai, who lives modestly and has
no known business interests, named his three children after Buddhist
precepts while the names of Thaksin's three children are derived from
the Thai word for gold.</TE>
<TE>   But the two have been friends since their days at the Police Cadet
Academy, and Purachai served as secretary-general of Thaksin's Thais
Love Thais party until early this year.</TE>
<TE>   Purachai's intense, straightforward, stick-by-the-law approach
rubs many people the wrong way, making the political future of
Thailand's "Mr. Clean" far from secure.</TE>
<TE>   "I am my own man--I have my independence, my dignity and my pride.
I will never accept to be anybody's puppet," Purachai told a Thai
news magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The 51-year-old Purachai entered politics only in the mid-1990s,
after a short career in the police and 15 years as a teacher and
president of the National Institute of Development Administration.</TE>
<TE>   His academic work and studies--he holds a doctorate in criminology
from Florida State University--clearly form the basis of his policies
as interior minister. These include an emphasis on the family and
"Crime Control Through Environmental Design," the title of one of his
books.</TE>
<TE>   "The family is the best instrument to prevent crime and instill
ethics and moral values in children," he has said.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Purachai's "new social order," or at least the most
publicized aspect of it, has focused on youth. And what Purachai sees
firsthand clearly shocks him.</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, Thai children invariably grew up under the
vigilant eyes of parents and elders. Courting couples hardly dared to
hold hands in public.</TE>
<TE>   But a blitz of Western ways and new socioeconomic forces has
dramatically changed all that.</TE>
<TE>   Methamphetamine and other drugs, along with prostitution, have
seeped into schools and campuses.</TE>
<TE>   The children of both the Bangkok elite and their poorer upcountry
cousins frequent a galaxy of night spots where almost everything is
for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Purachai's quest to reverse the trend has put him high on public
opinion polls and he has received support from the much-revered
constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</TE>
<TE>   But some critics say he should make more use of his powerful
ministry position to go after "hard targets"--a police force that
needs thorough reform; laws that are archaic; and corrupt
politicians, crooked business executives and drug kingpins.</TE>
<TE>   Others say he's not in a position to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "What can he do?" asks Thongbai, the lawyer and senator. "He has
popular support, but nobody in the government is on his side."</TE>

<HD>Hungarians Eager to Learn of Relatives' Wartime Fate</HD>
<DH>WWII: Freed from Soviet-era strictures, Budapest's
Institute of Military History provides answers to thousands who
waited more than 50 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARL PETER KIRK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUDAPEST, Hungary</DL>
<LD>Deep in the Hungarian army's dusty archives, Ferenc Szottfried is
finally coming to terms with the loss of two grandfathers he never
knew.</LD>
<LD>   Both were killed on the Russian front in World War II, but the
circumstances of their deaths and the location of their bodies were
kept secret by Hungary's postwar communist regime. The communists,
who were installed with the backing of the Red Army, wanted to hide
the unpleasant fact that Hungary fought with Nazi Germany against the
Soviet Union.</LD>
<LD>   Now, 12 years after the fall of communism, Szottfried has managed
to track the few remnants of his grandfathers' short and fatal
service in the poorly armed and severely outnumbered Hungarian army.</LD>
<TE>   A fragile, yellowing sketch of a body is the crude autopsy report
on the grandfather for whom he was named, 24-year-old Ferenc
Szottfried. Crosses drawn on the sketch by fellow soldiers show where
bullets ended his life on April 30, 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Tears spring to Szottfried's eyes as he thinks about his
grandfather's death, on the day before he was due to head home on
leave.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so strange after so many years to hold these objects, like
his bloodstained pay book and his dog tag, which were with him when
he died," said Szottfried, 30, an electrician who has a daughter,
Greta, 6.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother is 81 now, and it will mean a lot to her to see
these papers before she dies," he said in an interview at the
archive. "It is just so sad that she had to wait so long."</TE>
<TE>   A single index card recording the death is all Szottfried has on
his maternal grandfather, Istvan Vajdics, who was killed by shrapnel
at 43, on the northern part of the same front -- six months after
Pvt. Ferenc Szottfried died.</TE>
<TE>   Vajdics' widow, Ana, died in 1993 without ever finding out what
had become of him.</TE>
<TE>   For some of the thousands of Hungarians who have waited more than
half a century to learn of lost loved ones, the mystery is finally
being cleared up thanks to the work of Lt. Col. Janos Bus and his
colleagues at Budapest's Institute of Military History.</TE>
<TE>   Szottfried said his family managed to track down his grandfathers'
graves in Ukraine after neighbors spotted their names in one of the
colonel's books.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were from Puspokszilagy, a small village 30 miles north
of Budapest.</TE>
<TE>   Using unmarked archive materials buried in the institute's vaults,
Bus has collected the names of more than 60,000 of the 200,000-plus
Hungarian soldiers who died in the war or in Soviet captivity, and
has painstakingly researched where they are buried. The results fill
two hefty volumes packed with photographs and information.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have much time left because of the age of the close
relatives who are still alive," Bus said.</TE>
<TE>   "These books are in a way the cemeteries for these soldiers,
because many of the real cemeteries were destroyed on Stalin's orders
as the Soviets advanced," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The communists who took power in Hungary regarded the war veterans
as ideological enemies, even though the country tried unsuccessfully
to switch to the Allied side in late 1944.</TE>
<TE>   "After the war, the dead soldiers were a taboo subject," said Bus.
"You were not allowed to talk about their role in the war in public
because they fought against the Russians, who now controlled the
country and were officially allies."</TE>
<TE>   Also problematic for the Kremlin was the fact that about twice as
many Hungarian soldiers died in Soviet prisoner-of-war camps as in
battle.</TE>
<TE>   When he took over as head of the institute's archive in 1998, Bus
decided it was time to fill in the blanks for the bereaved so they
could grieve properly.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when they come here looking for information, the
children of these dead soldiers pour out the pain of half a century
of growing up without a father," he said. "When they see the
belongings, the letters and the photos, they finally feel that he was
a real person."</TE>
<TE>   Bus and his team have spent the last four years visiting the sites
where Hungarian soldiers are buried and recording what they find.
Szottfried's grandfather, Ferenc, lies in the village cemetery of
Otinja in southwestern Ukraine. The records show he was probably shot
by a sniper as he ran messages between different units along the
front line. He struggled for a few hours, but slowly suffocated as
blood filled his lungs.</TE>
<TE>   Istvan Vajdics is buried 120 miles away in Volosjanka.</TE>
<TE>   Szottfried plans to visit the graves this summer and put flowers
on them.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it will mean a lot to my remaining grandmother if I bring
her photos of the grave," he said. "She'll know that her husband
really is resting in peace."</TE>

<HD>Earhart's Fate Still Prompts Flights of Fancy--or Fantasy</HD>
<DH>History: The aviator went down in the Pacific in 1937. Was
she killed or captured? Or did she live out her life in New Jersey?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RON STATON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Elgen Long believes Amelia Earhart remains in her plane on the
Pacific Ocean floor after running out of fuel.</LD>
<LD>   Ric Gillespie thinks she landed on an island and died a castaway.</LD>
<LD>   Tod Swindell theorizes that she survived a crash landing in the
Marshall Islands, was captured by the Japanese and secretly
repatriated, living out her life as a New Jersey homemaker.</LD>
<TE>   Sixty-five years after her disappearance at age 39, Earhart
remains one of the U.S.' great mysteries and the subject of
continuing searches of the Pacific and research and debate.</TE>
<TE>   The tomboy who became an icon with her short tousled hair, leather
jacket and silk scarf already had set numerous flying records when
she began her final flight May 20, 1937, from Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   She made it as far as New Guinea. And on July 2, she took off from
there for tiny Howland Island on a 2,556-mile flight that would be
one of her longest and most dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, never made it to the tiny
atoll southwest of Hawaii. She radioed that she was running low on
fuel.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy searched for Earhart's plane but found no trace.</TE>
<TE>   The official position of the U.S. government has been that Earhart
and Noonan went down with their plane.</TE>
<TE>   Long, a consultant for Nauticos, a company based in Hanover, Md.,
supports the government conclusion and this year led a $1.7-million,
27-day search of waters within 100 miles of Howland. The expedition
had equipment problems and ended early. Nauticos plans to resume the
effort when repairs are made and more money is raised, Long said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have high expectations the airplane is in the area we are
searching," Long said. "It's important to find it to correct the
history of the event. It's too late to save Amelia, but it's not too
late to save the integrity of her legacy."</TE>
<TE>   The Nauticos effort was preceded by Dana Timmer's group in 1999.
Head of Howland Landing Ltd. of Reno, he spent $1 million hunting for
the plane. Timmer wants to try again, but he's waiting to raise more
money.</TE>
<TE>   He has acquired rights to the lost Lockheed Electra from Earhart's
estate. He wants to restore it and display it at a museum.</TE>
<TE>   Ric Gillespie, on the other hand, believes the plane landed at
Gardner Island, now called Nikumaroro, in the Phoenix Islands.</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie, a former aviation accident investigator, heads up the
International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, a nonprofit
effort that has made six trips to Gardner Island over the last 14
years.</TE>
<TE>   On the trip in September, the group found evidence of a castaway.
Artifacts recovered there are still being analyzed, Gillespie said.</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers believe the Marshall Islands are where Earhart
and Noonan landed; some of the most intriguing theories stem from
that site.</TE>
<TE>   Earhart's mother, Amy Otis Earhart, in a 1949 newspaper interview,
said she was convinced that her daughter was on a government mission
and was picked up by a Japanese fishing boat and taken to the
Marshalls, which the Japanese controlled at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1966 book "In Search of Amelia Earhart," the late Fred
Goerner says former Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz told him
Earhart and Noonan were picked up by the Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Most who believe that theory think Noonan was executed and Earhart
either was executed or died of dysentery.</TE>
<TE>   However, Joe Gervais' research has convinced him that Earhart
survived and was secretly repatriated. He believes she lived in New
Jersey using the name Irene Craigmile Bolam.</TE>
<TE>   Gervais, a retired fighter pilot, was introduced to Bolam in 1965
at a gathering of the Early Birds of Aviation, a group of aviation
pioneers. He thought she resembled Earhart, and she was wearing two
aviation pins Earhart had worn.</TE>
<TE>   When a book based on Gervais' research came out in 1970 -- "Amelia
Earhart Lives" by Joe Klaas--Bolam sued. Five years later, the
defendants offered to settle for the requested $2 million if Bolam
provided fingerprints in front of a judge. Bolam dropped the suit,
Gervais said in a 1996 interview with screenwriter Tod Swindell.</TE>
<TE>   Before Bolam died on July 7, 1982, she willed her body to Rutgers
University for research. A spokeswoman for the medical school there
said the body was cremated. Bolam's death certificate listed her
parents as "unknown."</TE>
<TE>   Swindell expanded on Gervais' research, trying to find out if
Bolam really was Earhart. He recently showed a conference of Earhart
aficionados overlays of photos of the pilot's face and hands, which
matched perfectly with those of Bolam.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exact congruence," said Swindell, who had the help of two
forensic pathologists.</TE>
<TE>   Even some skeptics find the evidence intriguing.</TE>
<TE>   "We were inclined to think Irene probably was not Amelia Earhart,"
said John Bolam, a retired aerospace engineer from Merritt Island,
Fla., and a half brother of Irene Bolam's husband, Guy. However, he
said, "The forensic studies are very convincing."</TE>
<TE>   Although Bolam denied being Earhart, she was not an ordinary
homemaker as she claimed, John Bolam said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was influential, knew many well-placed people and was well
traveled."</TE>

<HD>Tide Has Turned Against Executing Retarded Criminals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LUO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Momentum is growing across the country to reexamine the way mentally
retarded people are treated by the criminal justice system.</LD>
<LD>   Citing a growing national consensus, the U.S. Supreme Court
recently banned the execution of mentally retarded people. The
landmark decision was just the latest milestone.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 15 years, state legislatures have moved steadily to
outlaw capital punishment for the mentally retarded, reflecting
widespread belief that such defendants are less culpable than those
without mental disability and that they are uniquely vulnerable to
wrongful convictions.</LD>
<TE>   While exact figures are hard to come by, studies indicate that
mentally retarded people are convicted and incarcerated at higher
rates than others, less likely to successfully plea-bargain and more
likely to be abused in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Most estimates put mentally retarded inmates at 4% to 10% of the
U.S. prison population. In contrast, the American Assn. on Mental
Retardation estimates up to 3% of the general population is mentally
retarded.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics make perfect sense, said Ruth Luckasson, president
of AAMR.</TE>
<TE>   "They're at higher risk for waiving their rights, coming up with a
confession, not having enough money to hire a lawyer, getting
confused, all that stuff," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Inequities exist in every step of the criminal process, according
to advocates, but they are particularly concerned about
interrogations that result in confessions. Investigators are often
unaware of how suggestible mentally retarded suspects are and how
confused they can get under stress, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   People with mental retardation often pick up cues from their
questioners and adopt whatever story seems best to try to please
them, said Chris Slobogin, a criminal law and psychology professor at
the University of Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "They try to hide their retardation because they're embarrassed by
it. One way of doing that is to agree with whatever is being
suggested," said Slobogin, who has written a book on psychological
evaluations for courts.</TE>
<TE>   "The research indicates that children who are older than toddlers,
that is, 6, 7, 8, are no more suggestible, probably less suggestible,
than people who are mentally retarded."</TE>
<TE>   Experts suggest that police avoid leading questions and that they
videotape interrogations so they can be evaluated.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates point to cases involving defendants such as Earl
Washington Jr., a mentally retarded farmhand from rural Virginia. In
1982, after a lengthy interrogation, he confessed to a series of
crimes, including stabbing a young woman. Washington, whose IQ was
measured from 57 to 69, came within nine days of being executed
before DNA evidence exonerated him. He was freed in February 2001
after spending 18 years behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many of the 3,700 people currently on death row
are mentally retarded, but estimates have ranged as high as 20%. At
least 35 of the 781 people executed since 1976, when the death
penalty was reinstated, were mentally retarded, according to the
Death Penalty Information Center.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that most Americans, including those who support the
death penalty, now oppose the harshest punishment for mentally
retarded inmates.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1989, the number of states barring execution of retarded
people has jumped from 2 to 18. Thirteen states forbid all capital
punishment. The federal death penalty statute also forbids executions
of the mentally retarded.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court cited this growing consensus as evidence that
society's views have changed, and that the execution of retarded
people is now considered cruel and unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not so much the number of these states that is significant,
but the consistency of the direction of the change," Justice John
Paul Stevens wrote in the court's majority opinion.</TE>
<TE>   Those who disagree with the decision cite the problem of assessing
mental retardation. Experts usually base the diagnosis on a
combination of factors, including an IQ test, measurement of adaptive
skills and childhood learning problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court places the IQ cutoff at 70 (average IQ is about
100). But test results in which a few points can mean life or death
are likely to be bitterly contested.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence, unlike height or weight, is not a fixed measurement,
and IQ scores can differ depending on the test given and the
circumstances under which it is administered.</TE>

<HD>Steamboat Graveyards Yield 'Time Capsules' to Salvagers</HD>
<DH>History: Marine archeologists scour the 19th century wrecks
in the Missouri and Mississippi rivers for artifacts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM SUHR</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>His boots caked in the shoreline muck befitting the Missouri River's
pseudonym, the "Big Muddy," Steve Dasovich gingerly climbs about the
carcass of a 19th century steamboat and thinks death becomes her.</LD>
<LD>   Partly hidden under murky water and silt, the remains are a muddle
of rusted steel spiking through rotting wood, veined with cracks and
bleached by decades of sun and water. The outline of a vessel
spanning half a football field still can be seen, as can the wooden
spokes--half-buried in mud--showing where the massive paddlewheel
once turned.</LD>
<LD>   Dasovich is a maritime archeologist hired by the state of Missouri
to preserve any artifacts from the relic. He isn't put off by the
river, which teases him by giving up such skeletons of American
history when its waters recede, only to swallow them up again.</LD>
<TE>   "Wrecks show you something, then hide it again," he said, near
what could be the remnants of the Montana, among the largest
steamboats to ply the Missouri before it hit a railroad bridge and
sank in 1884.</TE>
<TE>   He's beaming. "This is a lot of wreck to be still in one piece.
This is an active river, a living river. So we're lucky to have this
much in one spot."</TE>
<TE>   The Missouri and Mississippi rivers have claimed hundreds of the
wood-devouring, smoke-belching giants. Many underwater tombs are
awaiting discovery.</TE>
<TE>   Many historians estimate that in the Missouri from St. Louis to
Fort Benton, Mont., hundreds of ships--many of them steamboats--were
done in by such calamities as fires, explosions, ice floes and
run-ins with toppled trees.</TE>
<TE>   Along a 180-mile stretch of the Mississippi from St. Louis south
to the river's confluence with the Ohio near Cairo, Ill., records
suggest more than 500 boats met a similar end.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many steamboat wreckage sites remain underwater
or beneath farm fields (hidden there by the river's shifting course)
or were ripped apart by currents. Their remains do appear to have
been alluring to those wanting to salvage them--or to souvenir
seekers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to see these wrecks," said Terry Norris, an
archeologist with the Army Corps of Engineers St. Louis district. "If
you envision the past as a jigsaw puzzle, each piece lying out there
is a piece. If enough of it is removed, it's impossible to see the
whole image."</TE>
<TE>   The watery graveyards reflect bygone days when steamboats ruled,
swelling from just a few on the Mississippi around 1815 to the more
than 700 that regularly rolled on the river by 1860.</TE>
<TE>   At the Port of St. Louis, 22,045 steamboat arrivals were logged
between 1845 and 1852. Two years later, steamboats could be seen
lined up side by side for more than a mile along the city's
riverfront.</TE>
<TE>   Powering them on the river was no small feat. Smaller steamboats
of the time burned 12 to 24 cords of wood every 24 hours, the larger
ones 50 to 75 cords--enough to build 15 small houses.</TE>
<TE>   Such staggering demand for wood resulted in widespread
deforestation and destabilizing of the river banks. Between 1821 and
1888, the Mississippi became increasingly wider and shallower, with
the lower channel depth disrupting navigation and posing perils for
all vessels. On average, a steamboat lasted 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Between St. Louis and Cairo, by some accounts, the Mississippi
steamboat wrecks averaged one each mile--200 altogether before the
vessels faded into lore and railroads gained popularity.</TE>
<TE>   Once salvaged, wrecked steamboats have proven to be popular draws.
Each year, roughly 150,000 people visit a Kansas City museum where
the centerpiece is the Arabia, which sank in 1856 near Parkville and
was exhumed--along with thousands of artifacts--in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still hundreds that remain to be identified, all
preserved under the sediment," said Norris, citing existing insurance
records that show where the ships went down and what was salvaged at
the time. "The ones still intact with cargo are essentially time
capsules with significant amounts of information about whatever
period we're talking about."</TE>
<TE>   There are few artifacts around the weathered wreckage Dasovich is
exploring. The sternwheeler's resting place, he says, has been looted
countless times. Dasovich has salvaged a crate of rusted, enameled
saucepans--some in pieces or without bottoms.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important for Missourians to see these types of
historical sites and allow them to have a better understanding of the
state's cultural heritage," Dasovich said.</TE>
<TE>   He plans to let the wreckage stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "Pending a big flood, it's not going anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   His only request is, "Look but don't touch."</TE>

<HD>Vocational Students Lose Out on Transfers</HD>
<DH>Education: Four-year colleges are accused of snobbery as
they reject many technical school courses. The move causes time and
money woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARLENE LEVINSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gregory Spon was a drafting student at Pittsburgh Technical Institute
when he decided to move on to a four-year college and earn a
bachelor's degree in engineering or architecture. He got a nasty
surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Spon hoped to transfer some credits, but one university after
another rejected the college-level courses taken with his vocational
training. After two years and $18,000 in federal student loans,
attending college meant beginning again as a freshman.</LD>
<LD>   "How do I start my education?" Spon recalls worrying. "I don't
have the money. I don't have the time to do that."</LD>
<TE>   Cases like Spon's are at the heart of complaints from many of the
nation's technical and vocational schools.</TE>
<TE>   They accuse four-year institutions of snobbery for rejecting their
college-level courses, particularly because both groups of schools
are eligible for federal aid under the country's patchwork system of
academic accreditation. Four-year schools say they need to be free to
decide what passes muster at their institutions.</TE>
<TE>   With roughly 3 in 5 undergraduates now attending more than one
school on their way to a bachelor's degree, according to federal
studies, transferring credits is a constant issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Career College Assn., which represents 1,050 institutions,
about half of them vocational or technical schools, says many
four-year schools are biased against them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mind-set," said Bruce Leftwich, a lobbyist for the
Washington-based group. Colleges, he said, "have elitist ideas that
our students don't match up."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based CCA argues their schools are on the same
footing as traditional colleges in the eyes of Congress when it
awards federal student aid. Any of the nation's more than 4,000
degree-granting colleges and universities--from the Ivy League to
beauty academies--is entitled to federal aid if approved by a
recognized accrediting agency.</TE>
<TE>   Regional accreditors vouch for traditional two- and four-year
institutions. National accreditors sanction professional programs,
such as nursing and law, religious schools and those teaching skills
like culinary arts or optometry. Some schools are accredited both
regionally and nationally.</TE>
<TE>   But regionally accredited colleges often refuse credits from the
more than 600 schools with only national accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The result, says the CCA, is a two-class system.</TE>
<TE>   "If a student is paying money and denied an education, and the
only reason they're denied is some club, then who does it hurt?"
Leftwich said. "It hurts the student."</TE>
<TE>   He stresses his group wants only to transfer credits for basic
college courses, such as English composition and advanced math and
sciences, not specialized vocational training.</TE>
<TE>   Still, administrators at traditional colleges assert their right
to determine which credits to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is entitled to a credential," said Barmak Nassirian of the
American Assn. of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
"Credentials are earned, and they are earned on the basis of the
autonomous decisions of the institutions who awarded them."</TE>
<TE>   Community colleges, meanwhile, stake out the middle ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We think universities, when they consider accepting credits for
transfer, shouldn't just look at accreditation status," said George
Boggs, president of the American Assn. of Community Colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Federal figures suggest that hundreds of thousands of students, at
least, enroll each year in technical and skills-training courses at
career schools and community colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one tracks how many try to transfer credit from those
courses, it appears to be a substantial minority.</TE>
<TE>   Spon, 25, finally found a school--the NewSchool of Architecture
and Design in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   It accepted many of Spon's credits, so he shaved about a year off
the school's five-year program.</TE>

<HD>Forecast Isn't Bright for the All-Star Game</HD>
<DH>Baseball: As best players gather in Milwaukee for annual
contest, a few clouds hang over the national pastime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN WALKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Whether the leaky roof at Miller Park is open or closed, the forecast
for this Bud Bowl is the same: cloudy, real cloudy.</LD>
<LD>   Because as baseball gathers in commissioner Bud Selig's backyard
for Tuesday night's All-Star game, all is not well.</LD>
<LD>   Will fans be buzzing about seeing Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa in
the same NL outfield after patching up their spring-training feud?</LD>
<TE>   Forget it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, listen to Sosa and Bonds--and the whole sport, for that
matter--caught up in the swirl over steroids.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that television ads promoting the game portrayed
Bonds, Sosa and other all-stars as puffed-up, crazed cartoon figures.</TE>
<TE>   Will Alex Rodriguez and Jason Giambi attract a lot attention at
Monday's home-run derby?</TE>
<TE>   Nope.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's big event comes nearby in suburban Chicago, where the
executive board of the players' union meets and may set a strike
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "This should be a time the fans could come out and see the best in
the world," said American League All-Star manager Joe Torre of the
New York Yankees. "Certainly threatening the fans with what could be
happening down the road is bad enough."</TE>
<TE>   Will St. Louis pitcher Matt Morris enjoy the fun and festivities?</TE>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   Not with the tragic death of teammate Darryl Kile and the death of
longtime Cardinal broadcaster Jack Buck so fresh. There will be
tributes to both on game night.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Ted Williams on the eve of All-Star weekend is
certain to cast a somber tone on the celebration. A few years ago,
his emotional return to Fenway Park was one of the greatest moments
in the game's recent history.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner did catch a break by avoiding a potentially
embarrassing boycott. Boston pitcher John Burkett didn't make the AL
team and couldn't follow through on his threat to skip it.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, this All-Star game will be overshadowed by
off-the-field issues.</TE>
<TE>   There's more, too.</TE>
<TE>   With contraction a possibility, will Vladimir Guerrero and Jose
Vidro be the last Montreal players ever in an All-Star game?</TE>
<TE>   And then there's no telling whether Mike Piazza will feel
compelled to repeat his "I'm not gay" remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to the All-Star game," Selig said. "People
are very excited in Milwaukee, as they are every place. And
hopefully, it will be everything that we think it is.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some problems we have to deal with. But the All-Star game
is still one of our premier events with a lot surrounding it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   At least, he hopes so.</TE>
<TE>   The former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig continues to live
in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he proudly threw out the ceremonial first ball when
Miller Park opened.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, All-Star Shawn Green of the Dodgers hit four
home runs in a game at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some fans coming to Miller Park this week will surely remember
something else--three workers were killed in July 1999 when a crane
collapsed during the stadium's construction.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the All-Star game is a pure showcase.</TE>
<TE>   At Safeco Field in Seattle last year, Mariner star Ichiro Suzuki
was the early focus of excitement. Then Cal Ripken provided the
highlight with a home run in his final All-Star appearance.</TE>
<TE>   During the Williams homecoming in 1999, Pedro Martinez added to
the thrill by striking out NL most valuable players Barry Larkin,
Larry Walker, Jeff Bagwell and Sosa, along with home-run champ Mark
McGwire.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Roger Clemens, Derek Jeter and a lot of players got their
first look at Coors Field. Their curiosity was satisfied as the AL
won 13-8 in the highest-scoring All-Star game in history.</TE>
<TE>   This year?</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of first-timers, 25 to be exact. Minnesota center fielder
Torii Hunter is on that list, and he'll start.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I don't pass out there in front of all those people when
they call my name out to be one of those All-Stars," Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Six players from the World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks,
including aces Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, will be at the game.</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen players from the Yankees, with Alfonso Soriano, Jorge
Posada and Giambi in the starting lineup. They'll try to help the AL
win for the sixth straight time and match its best streak ever.</TE>
<TE>   The NL leads the series, 40-31-1.</TE>
<TE>   One of those NL victories came in 1975, the last time the All-Star
game was played in Milwaukee. Bill Madlock hit a tiebreaking single
in the ninth inning off Goose Gossage in a 6-3 victory at old County
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   While Carl Yastrzemski hit his only All-Star home run on that day,
the game was notable for one other reason: it marked Hank Aaron's
24th and final All-Star appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Having begun his Hall of Fame career with the Milwaukee Braves, he
represented the Brewers when he lined out as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just a shell of what I was," Hammerin' Hank recalled. "But
I still considered it an honor to have played my last [All-Star] game
in Milwaukee."</TE>

<HD>Plenty Is Riding on Knee of Ravens' Jamal Lewis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PRESTON</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is one constant in the year of change for the Baltimore Ravens:
the key to the upcoming season is running back Jamal Lewis.</LD>
<LD>   He is the other Lewis, besides middle linebacker Ray, that the
Ravens can't afford to lose. Even with a starting lineup intact, the
Ravens will struggle to reach .500 in 2002. Without Jamal, they'll
struggle to win a few games. Period.</LD>
<LD>   The Ravens' brass knows that.</LD>
<TE>   With the opening of training camp about three weeks away, they're
holding their collective breath and crossing fingers that Lewis shows
up healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis was on a Florida beach this week. He plans to fly into
Baltimore the night before training camp, but plans to change clothes
in a phone booth.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be looking like Superman," Lewis said. "I've got a
lot to prove and a lot to accomplish. We've got a lot of young guys,
and I've got to be one of the leaders."</TE>
<TE>   Impressive, huh?</TE>
<TE>   Here's more: Lewis tore a left anterior cruciate ligament and
sprained the medial collateral ligament last Aug. 8, forcing him to
miss the 2001 season. Since the last mandatory camp ended June 13,
the third-year veteran has worked out daily with personal trainer
Tony Villanie from 8 in the morning until noon, mostly on speed and
stabilization drills for the injured knee.</TE>
<TE>   Once a week Lewis travels to the beach, working exclusively on
knee drive. He says he weighs 245, and will report at 235.</TE>
<TE>   Comeback attempts are nothing new. There was major reconstructive
surgery on his right knee as a sophomore at the University of
Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's been easier because I've been there," Lewis said. "I
knew what it was going to take. Looking back when it happened last
year, I really didn't get hit. I kind of got nicked, but my knee was
in the right place at the right time. It was meant to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have suggested that it's a two-year injury, but I
can't think that way," Lewis said. "I'm going into this thinking that
I'm just as good as before, that I've got my speed back to where it
was before when I turned the corner on the sidelines."</TE>
<TE>   It was beautiful to watch, a 5-foot-11, 235-pound diesel running
downhill. As a rookie, Lewis was the rare blend of speed and power
who ran around and through defenses for 1,364 yards on 309 carries.
He scored six touchdowns--most via the air in the red zone--with
Lewis going airborne over the line of scrimmage with that vintage,
outstretched arm move.</TE>
<TE>   Ball control and a great defense, that was the Ravens' forte then.
But times have changed. The Ravens are young. Seven starters from the
league's best defense the past two years are gone. The top two
candidates for the No. 2 running back position are rookies.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens need Lewis to run. In the words of the King of Soul,
James Brown, "Please, Please, Please," let the kid be able to run.</TE>
<TE>   No player would benefit more than quarterback Chris Redman. A
running game would take a lot of pressure off the third-year player,
who has seen less than two full quarters of playing time. Redman
could use the time to become more comfortable with receivers Brandon
Stokley, Todd Heap and Travis Taylor, who are nearly as inexperienced
as Redman.</TE>
<TE>   If Lewis gets injured again, that would leave the Ravens with
Chestor Taylor and Tellis Redmon as possible starters. Things could
get ugly.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a little scary," said Coach Brian Billick. "You have to
be as nervous about the situation as the Colts were last year with
(Edgerrin) James and (Dominic) Rhodes as his backup. I'd like to
bring in another veteran, but we don't have that option."</TE>
<TE>   The defense needs Lewis to play well, too. Here's what is going to
happen: Teams will isolate on young linebackers Adalius Thomas, Ed
Hartwell and cornerback Gary Baxter, and they'll give up big plays
early. But if Lewis runs well, the less time the trio will spend on
the field.</TE>
<TE>   If the Ravens can't run the ball, the front seven, with four new
players, stays on the field longer.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens know about the importance of Lewis. They've maintained
constant contact with him at the University of Tennessee, where he
works out. When there are any communication problems, the Ravens
dispatch a coach or trainer faster than SWAT teams move in on a
hostage situation.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the team's last minicamp, Lewis said he was at 90
percent, which was a slight exaggeration. He was too big, and huffing
and puffing at the end of long runs and practice.</TE>
<TE>   A limp was also noticeable after a long run.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill (trainer Tessendorf) attributed that limp to fatigue,"
Billick said. "We've seen him steadily get stronger. At the first
passing camp, you could see a little bit of hitch coming out of the
gate. He ran strong, hard, but it was noticeable. During the second
passing camp in the first week of June, the hitch seemed to be gone,
but we didn't do much.</TE>
<TE>   "The second week of June, we had more of regular practices, and
you could see the fatigue," Billick said. "That's fairly typical. A
player usually concentrates more on rehabbing the knee than on his
cardiovascular. But Jamal noticed the fatigue and that he couldn't
carry that weight coming into training camp."</TE>
<TE>   It's a safe bet to assume Lewis will report in great shape. He is
too eager to succeed, too young to quit. The Ravens will limit his
amount of practice and playing time in the preseason. They won't know
if the old Lewis is back until the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there will be two phases," Billick said. "The first will
be taking that first big hit and getting through the first physical
practice. The second will come when he might be asked to carry the
ball that 24th or 25th time, when that limp shows up, not because he
is injured, but because he is tired."</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said: "At first, I thought this was going to be a tough
year, but the guys have picked things up fast, and they're looking
good. They have surprised me a lot. I'm looking forward to putting on
the pads again, getting hit. The first game will be the biggest game
of the season for me."</TE>
<TE>   And maybe for the Ravens.</TE>

<HD>Filion Returns to Racing in the Shadow of Scandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDALL CHASE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HARRINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>Harness racing great Herve Filion took a drag on his cigarette and
leaned against the metal bleachers at Harrington Raceway.</LD>
<LD>   "My conscience is clear," said the Hall of Famer, back at the
track after a hiatus of seven years stemming from charges of
race-fixing. "I didn't do anything wrong on the racetrack."</LD>
<LD>   At 62, when many people are easing into retirement, Filion is
making a fresh start, two years after pleading guilty to a
misdemeanor in return for the dismissal of more serious charges that
rocked the racing world in 1995 and led to his exile.</LD>
<TE>   Suiting up his in red, white and blue colors, he picked up where
he left off, winning three races June 23 at Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very relaxed, comfortable, just like I never left," said
Filion, who picked up his 14,787th career victory Monday, inching
closer to his goal of 15,000. "It feels good. It feels very, very
good."</TE>
<TE>   Between races, Filion, who has about 4,000 more victories than any
other driver or jockey in the country, caught up with old friends,
shook a lot of hands and signed an autograph for a boy in a
wheelchair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the greatest thing that's happened to harness," said trainer
Augustus Schumatti. "He's what harness racing is all about. When he
wasn't here, people missed him."</TE>
<TE>   On June 18, Delaware racing officials granted a license allowing
Filion to resume a career that began when Dwight Eisenhower was
president.</TE>
<TE>   "Delaware gave me an opening," said Filion, who also has obtained
a conditional license in Pennsylvania and hopes to win approval in
Florida and Massachusetts as well. He is mulling a trip to Europe,
where his return has generated interest.</TE>
<TE>   New York is another matter. Filion applied for a license last year
with the New York State Racing and Wagering Board and was denied.</TE>
<TE>   "It was found that his character and fitness were not in the best
interest of racing," said board spokeswoman Stacy Clifford. A hearing
on Filion's appeal is scheduled for July 17.</TE>
<TE>   Clifford said officials in Delaware and Pennsylvania contacted New
York authorities before issuing licenses to Filion, who acknowledges
there is a cloud hanging over him but only wants to concentrate on
racing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not better than the next driver, but I'm as good," said
Filion, a 10-time Harness Tracks of America driver of the year. "Just
give me the horse ... and I'll take him to the wire."</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne, administrator for the Delaware Harness Racing
Commission, said Filion should be considered innocent unless proven
guilty, something New York prosecutors couldn't prove.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that under those circumstances, the man should be
given an opportunity to continue his career," Wayne said.</TE>
<TE>   "He is to harness racing what Babe Ruth was to baseball and Dale
Earnhardt to NASCAR," said Jack Walls, Harrington Raceway president
and chief executive officer. "It affords people at our track the
opportunity to see one of the greatest of all time."</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Edwards, a Wilmington horse owner, said it was only right
for Delaware to offer Filion a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   "He came to Harrington and Dover when some of the other big
drivers wouldn't," Edwards said. "He's done good for Delaware."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Filion and fellow drivers Frederick Grant and David
Ingraham were accused of grand larceny and conspiracy for allegedly
fixing races at Yonkers Raceway. The charges were dismissed in 2000
when the three drivers acknowledged they failed to file state tax
returns in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth driver, Darron Ryder, pleaded guilty in 1996 to a charge
of tampering with a sports contest.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmaker Daniel Kramer, alleged to be the mastermind, pleaded
guilty to gambling-related charges in 1996 and agreed to a $2 million
settlement with the New York attorney general's office.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, prosecutors were dealt a blow in their effort to
prosecute others in the case when New York's highest court questioned
the admissibility of evidence from electronic devices used to monitor
Kramer's telephone.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged Filion conspired to fix five races at Yonkers
in 1995 as a way of repaying a $6,000 loan from Kramer. Filion denies
the allegations and said he simply got caught up in the investigation
of Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   "I got indicted because I spoke to him on the phone," Filion said.
"One race, he asked me if I thought I could finish third. I said 'I
don't see why not.' ... Sure enough, I did finish third, but I got
placed second."</TE>
<TE>   Filion said he wanted a trial to clear his name. He said he
pleaded guilty to the tax charge, which netted him a $90 fine and one
year of probation, on advice of his lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he deserves a chance," said Salvatore DiMario, executive
director of the Delaware Standardbred Owners Association. "You took a
man's livelihood away from him for six and a half years without
proving he did anything wrong."</TE>

<HD>Division, Indecision on Testing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE WILSTEIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major league baseball isn't a total muscle beach party. Not yet,
anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Far from the perception, suggested by Jose Canseco, that every
locker room is filled with ballplayers on steroids, the truth is that
most players look as skinny or flabby or unremarkably fit as they
ever did.</LD>
<LD>   Strutting among them, a few per team on average, are the muscle
mutants who stand out with their sequoia chests, bison necks and
biceps as big as baseballs--players who have transformed themselves
in the weight room and, perhaps, through chemistry.</LD>
<TE>   It will surely look as if there are more of those incredible hulks
in the locker rooms for the home run derby Monday and All-Star game
Tuesday in Milwaukee as baseball brings together its biggest bashers.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows how many are on anabolic steroids because baseball
doesn't test for them or even have a policy against them. And no one
is likely to know anytime soon, if the current contract talks between
the players' association and the owners fail to produce a drug
program that includes random, year-round testing.</TE>
<TE>   There's no agreement on any aspect of drug testing. Attitudes in
baseball range from ambivalence to dismay to indifference. Players
are lined up on all sides of the testing issue, with some advocating
Olympic-style testing, some opposing it, and some preferring a more
limited program.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Randy Johnson doesn't even want to speak about the
subject, saying "that doesn't affect me."</TE>
<TE>   One of Johnson's teammates, pitcher Rick Helling, has been
bringing up the idea of testing at the union's executive board
meetings the past three winters.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the problem was growing and we should do something
about it, basically try to get something taken care of before it
turned into what it did," Helling said after Canseco's comments and
Ken Caminiti's acknowledgment that he took steroids during his MVP
season in 1996. "We have to figure out a way to get something done
now."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Phillie trainer Jeff Cooper said he believes the
percentage of major league players using steroids is in the low
single digits and that in 22 years with the team he has suspected
just one of his players of using them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an ethical issue in all of this," Cooper said. "If I'm
pitcher X, I might be thinking, 'Is this guy juiced up? What if he
hits me in the head with a line drive?' Is somebody going to hurt
somebody else because of the increased force and velocity of the ball
coming off the bat? It scares me. I've already seen one broken skull.
I don't need to see another one."</TE>
<TE>   New York Met slugger Mo Vaughn laughed at Canseco's comment that
85 percent of ballplayers are using steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in three clubhouses in my career and I've never heard a
word uttered about steroid use," Vaughn said. "Eight-five percent is
a ridiculous number ....Baseball weight training has really advanced
and guys are working hard. I hate to see their accomplishments
tarnished like this."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Cub All-Star Sammy Sosa, who has hit more homers than
anyone else in the past four years, is one of the most muscular major
leaguers but he has consistently denied using steroids and said he
would be first in line if baseball tested for drugs.</TE>
<TE>   When Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly approached him with the name
of a lab to get tested, Sosa was offended and turned him down. Reilly
wrote that he told Sosa such a test would "show everybody you're
clean ... and lift a cloud off you and a cloud off the game."</TE>
<TE>   Sosa said he had nothing to prove, arguing he has not had the kind
of ligament and tendon injuries often associated with steroid use.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole world knows that I'm innocent," he told the Chicago
Tribune and other reporters clustered around him in the locker room.
"You guys know that I play every day and I've been healthy all my
life. You can take it from there."</TE>
<TE>   Detroit's Dmitri Young doubted that anyone in baseball is taking
steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "What people don't understand is there are some guys with
naturally unbelievable physiques who are just animals in the weight
room and with their diet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Florida slugger Cliff Floyd also thinks ballplayers are getting a
bad rap.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like the things that are being said about the game,"
Floyd said. "I work my butt off during the offseason and I add 10
pounds of muscle. You tell me I'm doing steroids, then we're going to
fight. The only thing that's going to solve the problem is if we
start getting tested."</TE>
<TE>   Ballplayers have been taking amphetamines for decades, New York
Met catcher Mike Piazza said, but he also doubts the extent of
steroid use suggested by Canseco and Caminiti.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of it is hysteria," he said. "It's for pure shock
value."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, acknowledged that
it's likely some of his players are taking steroids. Met Manager
Bobby Valentine said he wouldn't be surprised if 15 percent of the
players in the majors are on steroids.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be the naive baby or village idiot and say
there's none," he said. "I'm sure there's some use."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay general manager Chuck LaMar favors testing for steroids
because they threaten players' health and may alienate fans.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an identity problem as it is because of the money with
the major league players," LaMar said. "I think the fans would
appreciate [testing] so that they know that the player out there that
they're paying good money to see is not using some type of illegal
substance."</TE>
<TE>   LaMar said the blame for steroid use rests with the system more
than with the players since they are paid millions of dollars to
perform at a high level as long as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do is increase that temptation to find something that
will give you longevity or keep you in the major leagues because of
the money that's involved," he said.</TE>

<HD>A Major Step Forward</HD>
<DH>Former football star struggles at triple A but vows to make
Yankees</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDY RESNIK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio</DL>
<LD>Drew Henson is sticking with his plan. He wants to be like Mike
Schmidt instead of John Elway.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a baseball player," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Time will tell whether he's a good one.</LD>
<TE>   Henson is struggling in his first full season in triple A since
deciding on being a third baseman instead of a quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of being discouraged by his play for the Columbus
Clippers, Henson remains confident. He plans to be in The Bronx next
season, alongside Derek Jeter in the Yankees' infield.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the reason I'm playing this sport is for those kind of
opportunities," Henson said. "I'm one of the luckiest guys around to
be put in such a great situation. The excitement's there and that's
what motivates me to keep trying to get better and get up there."</TE>
<TE>   Henson, though, didn't always feel that way.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees traded Henson to Cincinnati in the summer of 2000 when
the team couldn't persuade him to turn in his helmet for a cap.
Frustrated by his unwillingness to commit to them, the Reds shipped
Henson back to New York in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Henson signed a six-year, $17 million contract that
included a provision that he had to skip his senior season at
Michigan and could not play professional football.</TE>
<TE>   The money didn't equal what Henson would have made as a top pick
in this year's NFL draft, but he thought it was a substantial
commitment from the Yankees--a team that doesn't settle for second
best.</TE>
<TE>   "It had to be done right then," he said. "The opportunity to play
for this organization and fit into their plans down the road wasn't
something I could afford to put off any longer."</TE>
<TE>   While Henson struggles to hit .260 and has committed 20 errors
this season, Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman is confident that
Henson is on course to play in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Ventura's solid play this season means the Yankees can wait
another year for Henson to improve.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our third baseman of the future," Cashman said. "As far as
his path and projection, he's like a good book. You want to take it
page by page and not rush it. You want to give it time because you
know it's going to be a good read."</TE>
<TE>   Columbus Manager Stump Merrill, who's worked for the Yankees for
26 years, likes Henson's intelligence, his work ethic and his
willingness to learn.</TE>
<TE>   But there's one thing holding Henson back, Merrill said. "I can
sum it up in one word real easy: experience."</TE>
<TE>   Henson struggles with breaking balls and changeups--like most
young hitters--and sometimes is out of position in the field.</TE>
<TE>   In a game last week, he committed two errors in one inning,
leading to an unearned run in a 10-3 loss.</TE>
<TE>   In football, Henson never seemed to make a mistake for the
Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, he threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns and
ran for the clinching score with just over a minute left as Michigan
beat Ohio State, 38-26, before 98,568 at Ohio Stadium. His arm and
mobility drew comparisons to Elway. Scouts said he could be the first
pick in the 2002 NFL draft.</TE>
<TE>   So why is Henson spending the summer in Columbus instead of the
Houston Texans' training camp? "It all came down to what I wanted to
do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, playing baseball has included getting booed by Clipper
fans who seem unwilling to accept a former Wolverine in the heart of
Buckeye country. But Henson isn't fazed.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got maybe 2,000 or 3,000 people here (in Cooper Stadium)
on average compared to 95,000 like they had at the Horseshoe," he
said. "It's no comparison.... I've been booed worse and I will be
booed worse."</TE>
<TE>   Henson said he's currently a better football player than baseball
player, but that will change.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to put in your time," he said. "It's just putting it
together and being consistent for weeks at a time and proving that to
the Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   No matter what happens with the Yankees, Henson has no plans to
return to football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really a non-issue," he said. "I love playing baseball and
this is what I do for a living. Football is something I did in
college and had a great time doing it, but it's nothing more than
that."</TE>

<LD>Secession--A story in the June 30 Real Estate section referred
incorrectly to the "alimony" payments that a San Fernando Valley city
would be required to pay if it becomes independent from Los Angeles.
The payment is set at $127.1 million for the first year, and would
gradually decline to zero over 20 years. The story also incorrectly
suggested that a Valley city might experience a shortfall in revenue
because it would not be allowed to levy a real estate transfer tax
that currently generates about $30 million per year. Under the terms
of secession, a Valley city would begin operations with a budget
reserve. While a Valley city would not be able to levy the transfer
tax as Los Angeles does, that amount has already been figured into
the budget for the proposed city and would not create a revenue gap.</LD>

<HD>Forecast Isn't Bright for the All-Star Game</HD>
<DH>Baseball: As best players gather in Milwaukee for annual
contest, a few clouds hang over the national pastime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN WALKER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Whether the leaky roof at Miller Park is open or closed, the forecast
for this Bud Bowl is the same: cloudy, real cloudy.</LD>
<LD>   Because as baseball gathers in commissioner Bud Selig's backyard
for Tuesday night's All-Star game, all is not well.</LD>
<LD>   Will fans be buzzing about seeing Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa in
the same NL outfield after patching up their spring-training feud?</LD>
<TE>   Forget it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, listen to Sosa and Bonds--and the whole sport, for that
matter--caught up in the swirl over steroids.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help that television ads promoting the game portrayed
Bonds, Sosa and other all-stars as puffed-up, crazed cartoon figures.</TE>
<TE>   Will Alex Rodriguez and Jason Giambi attract a lot attention at
Monday's home-run derby?</TE>
<TE>   Nope.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's big event comes nearby in suburban Chicago, where the
executive board of the players' union meets and may set a strike
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "This should be a time the fans could come out and see the best in
the world," said American League All-Star manager Joe Torre of the
New York Yankees. "Certainly threatening the fans with what could be
happening down the road is bad enough."</TE>
<TE>   Will St. Louis pitcher Matt Morris enjoy the fun and festivities?</TE>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   Not with the tragic death of teammate Darryl Kile and the death of
longtime Cardinal broadcaster Jack Buck so fresh. There will be
tributes to both on game night.</TE>
<TE>   The death of Ted Williams on the eve of All-Star weekend is
certain to cast a somber tone on the celebration. A few years ago,
his emotional return to Fenway Park was one of the greatest moments
in the game's recent history.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner did catch a break by avoiding a potentially
embarrassing boycott. Boston pitcher John Burkett didn't make the AL
team and couldn't follow through on his threat to skip it.</TE>
<TE>   But clearly, this All-Star game will be overshadowed by
off-the-field issues.</TE>
<TE>   There's more, too.</TE>
<TE>   With contraction a possibility, will Vladimir Guerrero and Jose
Vidro be the last Montreal players ever in an All-Star game?</TE>
<TE>   And then there's no telling whether Mike Piazza will feel
compelled to repeat his "I'm not gay" remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to the All-Star game," Selig said. "People
are very excited in Milwaukee, as they are every place. And
hopefully, it will be everything that we think it is.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some problems we have to deal with. But the All-Star game
is still one of our premier events with a lot surrounding it," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   At least, he hopes so.</TE>
<TE>   The former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig continues to live
in the city.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, he proudly threw out the ceremonial first ball when
Miller Park opened.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this season, All-Star Shawn Green of the Dodgers hit four
home runs in a game at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some fans coming to Miller Park this week will surely remember
something else--three workers were killed in July 1999 when a crane
collapsed during the stadium's construction.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, the All-Star game is a pure showcase.</TE>
<TE>   At Safeco Field in Seattle last year, Mariner star Ichiro Suzuki
was the early focus of excitement. Then Cal Ripken provided the
highlight with a home run in his final All-Star appearance.</TE>
<TE>   During the Williams homecoming in 1999, Pedro Martinez added to
the thrill by striking out NL most valuable players Barry Larkin,
Larry Walker, Jeff Bagwell and Sosa, along with home-run champ Mark
McGwire.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Roger Clemens, Derek Jeter and a lot of players got their
first look at Coors Field. Their curiosity was satisfied as the AL
won 13-8 in the highest-scoring All-Star game in history.</TE>
<TE>   This year?</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of first-timers, 25 to be exact. Minnesota center fielder
Torii Hunter is on that list, and he'll start.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I don't pass out there in front of all those people when
they call my name out to be one of those All-Stars," Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Six players from the World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks,
including aces Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, will be at the game.</TE>
<TE>   A half-dozen players from the Yankees, with Alfonso Soriano, Jorge
Posada and Giambi in the starting lineup. They'll try to help the AL
win for the sixth straight time and match its best streak ever.</TE>
<TE>   The NL leads the series, 40-31-1.</TE>
<TE>   One of those NL victories came in 1975, the last time the All-Star
game was played in Milwaukee. Bill Madlock hit a tiebreaking single
in the ninth inning off Goose Gossage in a 6-3 victory at old County
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   While Carl Yastrzemski hit his only All-Star home run on that day,
the game was notable for one other reason: it marked Hank Aaron's
24th and final All-Star appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Having begun his Hall of Fame career with the Milwaukee Braves, he
represented the Brewers when he lined out as a pinch-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just a shell of what I was," Hammerin' Hank recalled. "But
I still considered it an honor to have played my last [All-Star] game
in Milwaukee."</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove Chooses Wisely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A homeowner whose emotional plea helped to derail a massive
redevelopment project that could have forced 1,000 Garden Grove
families to move subsequently described the victory as "what America
is all about." What the Garden Grove City Council did certainly was
good and sensible policy, whatever else. It voted unanimously to drop
huge chunks of land from a proposed 195-acre redevelopment project
that would have wiped out hundreds of houses, mobile homes and
apartment units.</LD>
<LD>   The council vote reaffirmed that, at heart, Garden Grove is a
residential community. An estimated 700 Garden Grove residents
delivered that message during an intense seven-hour City Council
meeting late in June. Thankfully, council members listened to
constituents and dropped 500 houses, 300 mobile homes and dozens of
apartment units from the rezoning that would have cleared the way for
massive redevelopment.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners were the winners because, given the high price of
housing throughout Southern California, it's difficult to imagine
that the city could have kept its promise to relocate families whose
properties eventually would have been taken, and long-standing
neighborhoods faced the threat of being ripped apart.</LD>
<TE>   Council members, though, had solid reasons for promoting the
massive redevelopment project. The hodgepodge of houses, trailers,
apartments and small retail establishments along the city's major
thoroughfares--as well as the corresponding lack of big shopping
malls, big hotels and big-box retailers--make Garden Grove the second
poorest city in Orange County in terms of sales tax revenue
collected.</TE>
<TE>   Cities fight hard for a new Costco or an auto mall because they
fear losing a potential cash cow to their next-door neighbor. Garden
Grove officials long have cast an envious eye at next-door neighbor
Anaheim, which benefits mightily from Disneyland and its
constellation of revenue-generating hotels, restaurants and retail
outlets.</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano lacks nearby Dana Point's upscale hotels, so
it's considering selling a tract that would be used to house a Home
Depot--a deal that would generate a $9-million payday for the city.
Cypress' plan to use eminent domain to seize land owned by a church
and turn it over to Costco has generated negative national publicity
in the form of a Wall Street Journal editorial and network news
stories.</TE>
<TE>   The game of civic one-upmanship has disrupted solid planning
practices and created a cadre of rich cities and a second tier of
have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   The first step toward a return to rational urban planning is the
passage of AB 680, which will be considered by the state Senate later
this summer. Affluent cities oppose the bill, which would regionalize
the distribution of sales tax on a trial basis in the Sacramento
area, but it's a necessary step toward reducing the painful gap
between haves and have-nots.</TE>

<LD>Re "Outside Inquiry of D.A. Ordered," June 29:</LD>
<LD>   I never cease to be amazed at the lengths to which entrenched
government bureaucrats will go to trash someone trying to clean
things up.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Rackauckas was elected in 1998 with a mandate to toss out the
corrupt and abusive members of the Capizzi-Wade administration.
Rackauckas did that, and now, a grand jury, hijacked by those same
people, issues a self-righteous (and taxpayer-funded) "report"
condemning him for his efforts.</LD>
<TE>   Rackauckas should be praised, not scorned. This grand jury report
tells me one thing: Rackauckas did exactly what we elected him to
do--clean house. That's the thing Wade and his cronies could never
came to terms with. Fortunately, the voters did it for him in March,
by crushing his insidious and laughable candidacy for D.A.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Rackauckas: Criticism Is Driven by Politics," June 27:</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, these are serious and depressing times. It is good to
know that we can always look to the newspaper for a smile or even a
good belly laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Rackauckas, our esteemed district attorney who has come up
just short of being indicted by the county grand jury, says: "None of
this should undermine the public's trust." Tony Rackauckas discussing
the public's trust? There's a laugh. Rackauckas hasn't a clue to what
the term means.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney claims he was elected "to bring far-reaching
change." That has happened. Never before has the sitting district
attorney pandered to so many of his political friends, including
Ambassador George Argyros and the rest, while letting the integrity
of his office sink so low.</TE>
<TE>   He was a mediocre judge. If he were only a mediocre district
attorney, we'd settle for that. God knows, Orange County has had
plenty of those. His actions in office tear the heart out of what
should be the pristine integrity of the office.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury at least had the guts to stand up and say that his
behavior is outrageous, that something should be done. Now, will any
of the politicians busy issuing press releases decrying the 9th
Circuit's "Pledge of Allegiance" ruling have the guts to follow
through on the grand jury report and get this guy out of office?</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gable</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the long-awaited county grand jury report now released, the
matter now comes before the county Board of Supervisors. There is no
doubt that the report is unusual, and indicates a problem in the
district attorney's office. Is Orange County in reality more like
Hazard County?</TE>
<TE>   William A. Wetzel</TE>
<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Criminals who are indicted by a county grand jury generally
complain that the district attorney's office controls the jury. The
district attorney usually praises the panel as a group of impartial
citizens. Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas is rightfully
criticized by the county grand jury and he cries that the panel is
"politically motivated." Does Rackauckas have the mind-set of a
criminal?</TE>

<LD>Re "Tollway Price Is Fair, OCTA Says," June 25:</LD>
<LD>   Members of the public and the press have a right to review
documents on which elected officials and county agencies base
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   The Times reported that the Orange County Transit Agency released
documents regarding the 91 tollway negotiations solely as a result of
public information requests filed by The Times and the Orange County
Register.</LD>
<TE>   OCTA released the documents because, as a public agency, we report
directly to our customers: residents and riders in Orange County. In
dealings with the 91 tollway, documents were released because it is a
standard part of the process. Our policy is to share public
information regarding public funds when the board reviews these
materials.</TE>
<TE>   More than a month ago, I assured the public and the media that
every document presented to the OCTA board would also be made
available to the public with sufficient time for thorough review
before any final vote on the possible 91 tollway purchase.</TE>

<LD>Re "Limited John Wayne Expansion OKd," June 26:</LD>
<LD>   The settlement agreement on John Wayne Airport expires in 3 1/2
years. Sure, the county Board of Supervisors passed a 5-0 resolution
in favor of an extension. One would think this would be a time of
hugs and kisses for the whole county. However, the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Air Transport Assn.--not local
politicians--are the final authority on the matter.</LD>
<LD>   It's amusing to hear Supervisor Todd Spitzer, the overconfident
lawyer and the dragon slayer of El Toro, say he will litigate to
prevent future growth of John Wayne. Sorry, but it's not that simple.
When the powerful ATA insists that there is demand for more airport
growth in Orange County, it will prevail in federal court on
interstate commerce grounds.</LD>
<TE>   Trying to stop the ATA is akin to trying to prevent the tide from
rising. However, the water can be diverted. So where will the rising
tide of future flights occur? It's inevitable, they will have to go
somewhere. Unless, Spitzer wants to see more approaches to John Wayne
going over his district, he had best come up with a
solution--possibly another site--that will have the ATA 's blessing.</TE>

<LD>Re "On Some Airlines, Size Does Matter," June 21:</LD>
<LD>   If you've sat next to someone in an airplane whose obesity
overflows onto your seat, straitjacketing you into your seat so that
it is virtually impossible for you to move, then you can imagine why
the people of Southwest Airlines want to have obese people pay for
two seats instead of one.</LD>
<LD>   If these obese people can't afford a first-class seat where the
seats are generally much wider than in coach, then every airline has
my vote to charge these people for an extra seat so that the rest of
us can sit in some kind of comfort and enjoy the flight.</LD>

<HD>Huntington Considering an Animal Act Ban</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "The Human Wrongs Behind Animal Rights," June 30:</LD>
<LD>   I am writing in response to the letter from the former circus
employee opposing the Huntington Beach City Council's decision to
consider a ban on the exploitation of wild and exotic animals in
circuses. Society is becoming more and more enlightened on this issue
because circus animals live hideous lives, deprived of everything
that is natural to them. Additionally, these animals can pose a
threat to public safety. Consequently, many cities, counties and even
countries around the world have passed legislation prohibiting this
form of animal cruelty.</LD>
<LD>   The attacks on "animal activists" also are disturbing. Just
because a person opposes cruelty to animals does not make one a
"terrorist." That word is particularly insulting and misdirected
given the times. Those who support the capture of wild animals that
are forced to tour the country in cages and perform stupid tricks for
the amusement of humans are more closely aligned with "terrorist"
mentality than those who oppose animal cruelty. The Huntington Beach
City Council should be commended for its courage and intelligence.</LD>
<TE>   Priscilla Gargalis</TE>

<TE>   I would like to commend the Huntington Beach City Council for
having the foresight to consider banning circuses. There is
absolutely no reason for animals to be exploited in this cruel way.
The tricks that they are made to perform are not natural behaviors.
They are beaten into the animals through the use of "terror tactics,"
including whips, tight collars, bull hooks and other abusive tools.
There is plenty of documented evidence available to substantiate
these claims.</TE>
<TE>   Tigers do not willingly jump through hoops of fire; big cats are
naturally terrified of fire. Elephants sometimes go berserk and kill
people. Circuses without animals are the only good circuses; we do
not learn anything by subjecting animals to perform acts for some
people's amusement.</TE>
<TE>   Many enlightened countries, including Sweden, Finland,
Switzerland, Denmark and India, have banned circuses using animals.
May we learn by their good example.</TE>

<TE>   I think Shirley Carroll O'Connor lives in a dream world. Maybe she
should go behind the scenes of a circus and see what is going on. It
is sad to see a majestic animal like an elephant beaten into
submission to make it stand on its head. Pushed by years of cruelty,
animals often lash out against their captors. Let's make Huntington
Beach a humane city.</TE>

<LD>   After reading your article, I have to hand it to pro-airport
supporters. They've tried to disguise themselves as groups worried
about jobs and the economy. Now they reappear as a water quality
group.</LD>
<LD>   Although inventive, when you peel away the facade, all you find is
another Newport Beach-based group trying to tell Irvine what to do

<TE>   Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and City Councilman Chris Mears should be
ashamed of themselves for engaging in a smear campaign against Defend
the Bay and its director, Robert Caustin.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and Mears have accused Defend the Bay of being backed by
pro-airport money but have never once offered any proof.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know how opposing more sludge in Newport Bay is
pro-airport. I'd like to know how opposing the transfer of 8,000
housing units into the Northern Sphere is pro-airport. And I'd like
to know how any of this is relevant, considering that the Navy has
stated that it will sell off the El Toro base in parcels for
non-aviation uses once Irvine annexes the land.</TE>
<TE>   The El Toro airport proposal is dead, but that doesn't seem to
stop Agran and Mears from using Joe McCarthy tactics in destroying
the reputation of citizens exercising their right to be heard.</TE>

Irvine's Northern Sphere development would have on adjacent cities.
But, where was this neighborly concern in her previous letters
promoting an LAX-like airport at El Toro that would have had jets

development makes an airport at El Toro that much harder to attain.</TE>

<HD>Go Slow on Merrill Lynch Ties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's too soon for Orange County to be embracing a "business as usual"
relationship with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the giant brokerage firm that
played a crucial role in the county's 1994 bankruptcy. Elected
officials and taxpayers shouldn't forget the county lost $1.7 billion
on ill-advised investments during Merrill Lynch's watch.</LD>
<LD>   County services continue to suffer because the county is making
$93 million in annual interest payments on $1 billion in bonds sold
in the wake of the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill Lynch's share of the huge California municipal bond
underwriting market plunged to 6.5% from 18.4% in the three years
after the bankruptcy filing. So the firm clearly sees the county's
stamp of approval as a way to polish its image among potential
municipal customers.</LD>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch has resumed doing limited business with some local
government agencies, including the Santa Ana Unified School District
and the Irvine Ranch Water District.</TE>
<TE>   County Treasurer-Tax Collector John M. Moorlach, a fierce Merrill
Lynch critic at the time of the bankruptcy, says he's willing to give
the giant firm some of the county's business. Others clearly aren't
ready to bury the hatchet.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer, who also is Orange County Transportation
Authority chairman, says he'll forgive and forget after Merrill Lynch
reimburses the county for bankruptcy-related losses.</TE>
<TE>   Elected officials in the county shouldn't necessarily keep the
financial-services giant on the sidelines if it can prove beyond a
doubt that its service and rates are competitive. The Irvine Ranch
Water District, which sued Merrill Lynch and collected $18 million,
has adopted what seems to be a sensible approach. The district
contracted with Merrill Lynch to handle two short-term debt deals.
Based upon its successful work, the firm now is eligible to compete
for a $50-million bond issue.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated development, Merrill Lynch recently agreed to pay
$100 million to settle charges that its stock analysts served up
tainted advice to investors during the dot-com boom. Merrill Lynch
has been spending freely on advertising that's designed to polish its
image with investors. The glitzy advertisements promise the firm will
work "face to face, eye to eye, to help realize your financial
goals."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill Lynch's eyes were closed to everything but potential
profits during the days leading up to the county's painful
bankruptcy. Elected officials owe it to taxpayers to keep their eyes
open while considering whether Merrill Lynch should be invited to
compete for business involving taxpayers' funds.</TE>

<HD>Continue Probe of Rackauckas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Grand Jury didn't do voters any favors when it
waited for more than three months after the March election to release
its in-depth and critical report on Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas. We
had urged the grand jury to make its findings public well before the
election so voters would have an unbiased view of the controversy
generated by Rackauckas' alleged politicization of his office.</LD>
<LD>   There could be no more pressing assignment for this grand jury
than getting to the bottom of criticism that friends of the county's
top law enforcement officer enjoyed favored treatment during the
incumbent's first term. By waiting until late June to issue its
findings, the grand jury lost a golden opportunity to inform the
voters who in the spring embraced the district attorney for another
four-year term. Much of what the grand jury reported is not new
information, and indeed was the focus of challenger Wally Wade's
unsuccessful campaign challenge. But had it come out earlier, the
voters would have had a chance to consider the panel's findings
before casting ballots.</LD>
<TE>   Rackauckas, who previously dismissed the grand jury investigation
as little more than a routine audit, since has slammed the report as
politically motivated. Neither description holds up. The grand jury
isn't a perfect reflection of Orange County's population, but it is
representative of the concerns that residents have when it comes to
good, clean government. These aren't people who are carrying a grudge
against the district attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The seriousness of the conclusions seems to put to rest any
question about whether the district attorney has conflicting
allegiances in cases involving some campaign contributors. It's no
longer possible to pass off the complaints as the grumbling of a few
unhappy holdovers from the days of former Dist. Atty. Mike Capizzi or
sour grapes left over from Wade's unsuccessful challenge.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors took a step in the right direction by hiring a
law firm to investigate the grand jury's 92 findings and 42
recommendations. But state law apparently precludes supervisors from
doing much of anything when it comes to policing the district
attorney's office. So it's time for the state attorney general's
office, which helped jurors prepare the report, to further
investigate possible wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Rackauckas' outright rejection of any wrongdoing, the
grand jury report contains serious allegations that Rackauckas
intervened in criminal cases at the request of political supporters,
hired family members of friends over more qualified candidates and
used public resources for personal business. One of the panel's most
striking recommendations is to bar the district attorney from hiring
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas is probably betting that the report is a tempest in a
teapot, and that voters will quickly move on to other concerns. But
the newly re-elected district attorney owes the public more than his
promised point-by-point refutation of the grand jury's findings. The
lengthy report includes dozens of substantive findings that
Rackauckas simply cannot brush aside.</TE>
<TE>   The report's findings and recommendations need to be reviewed in
the clear light of day. The alternative is four years of mistrust and
a district attorney whose effectiveness could be diminished. The
county's residents deserve better than that.</TE>

<HD>Freeway Pileup Kills 5 in Stockton</HD>
<DH>Crash: Three children are hurt after SUV and car veer into
oncoming traffic on Interstate 5.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Five people--including two infants and a small child--died in a fiery
four-car collision Saturday on Interstate 5 in Stockton.</LD>
<LD>   The midday crash left two more children badly burned at a
Sacramento-area hospital, said Officer Ted Montez, a spokesman for
the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred when a black Honda and red Ford Expedition
sport-utility vehicle traveling south on Interstate 5 collided and
careened across a highway divider into oncoming traffic, Montez said.</LD>
<TE>   The Expedition slammed into an oncoming Volvo and burst into
flames, he said. Another car, a silver Toyota, tried to swerve but
crashed into the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Several passersby pulled three children from the SUV, two who were
badly burned and one with minor injuries, Montez said. The Toyota's
driver and a child died at the scene. The driver of the Volvo and two
infants also were killed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not release the identities of the victims pending an
investigation and notification of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The highway's northbound lanes were closed for about two hours
after the crash, which occurred about 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Montez said, "There's nothing at this point to indicate that
alcohol or drugs were involved."</TE>

whole community has really embraced these kids," Paliska said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a cultural exchange."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball wasn't the only culture being exchanged, however.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, team members shared meals, had a pool party
and barbecue, watched fireworks, visited Wild Rivers Waterpark and
participated in the city's annual Fourth of July parade.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it held on our behalf?" asked an incredulous Hsui-Chuan
Tseng, 17, who plays left field for the Taiwanese team.</TE>
<TE>   The local teams were the regular squads from the Irvine,
Northwood, University and Woodbridge high schools, while Hermosillo
fielded its City League All Stars, and Taiwan sent a team from the
National Taoyuan Senior Vocational, Agricultural and Industrial
School.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best-attended events on Saturday, when University High
School lost 11-1 to Taiwan, was an impromptu demonstration of
cheerleading skills by the Woodbridge High School cheerleaders for an
appreciative Taiwanese team.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very easy to get along with," said Kevin Chen, 17, one
of the Taiwanese players.</TE>
<TE>   "Chinese girls are more conservative and introverted."</TE>
<TE>   In an apparently successful effort to impress the American girls,
the Taiwanese boys got into the act too, demonstrating several dances
and chants--as well as the proper pronunciation of the phrase shuai
mou, or "handsome cat."</TE>
<TE>   "These guys rock," said Sabrina Jacobs, 15, when it was all over.</TE>
<TE>   Added fellow cheerleader Abby Altman, 15: "They're very respectful
and really fun to hang with. We all want to go to Taiwan."</TE>
<TE>   The visitors had their share of surprises too.</TE>
<TE>   Isidro Morales Ramirez, manager of the Hermosillo team, said he
was impressed with the host city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The parks, the facilities--it's very different from what we're
used to; it's a whole other world."</TE>
<TE>   Chiahao Liu, 18, of Taoyuan said he was struck by the size of the
American and Mexican players, compared with himself and the others
from Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem more mature," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And teammate Chen said the first thing he would remember about
America is the abundance of hamburgers.</TE>
<TE>   "In Taiwan I wanted more of them," he said, "but this is too many.
I miss Chinese food."</TE>

<HD>Bush Gets His Name on Another Close Vote</HD>
<DH>Education: Stockton district officials believe their
future elementary school is the first to be named for the president.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>STOCKTON</DL>
<LD>A new middle school here to be named for author Maxine Hong Kingston
received unanimous approval. So did the planned elementary schools
that will honor Stockton's first African American schoolteacher and a
local soldier who received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his
heroism during the Vietnam War.</LD>
<LD>   But when it came to naming a school after the sitting president of
the United States, school board members had different opinions.</LD>
<LD>   The Democrats on the board believed it was premature to honor a
leader whose legacy has yet to unfold.</LD>
<TE>   The Republicans, who hold a majority, said phooey. This was about
patriotism. And besides, one of them said, there are lots of schools
in Stockton named for mediocre presidents.</TE>
<TE>   Thus it was decided that Stockton Unified would become what may be
the first school district in the nation to name a school for
President George W. Bush. No stranger to close elections, the leader
of the free world squeaked by in this one on a 4-3 vote last month.</TE>
<TE>   So far it's just a sprawling expanse of flattened dirt among some
of this Central Valley city's last remaining 90-year-old walnut
groves. But by fall 2003, the squat, stucco George W. Bush Elementary
School will have 25 classrooms and enough space for about 800
year-round students.</TE>
<TE>   School board President Glen Dolberg said he had hoped to avoid
controversy over any particular school by bringing up all of the
proposed names for a vote at the same time. Flush with cash from an
$80-million school bond that passed in November 2000, the overcrowded
district of 39,000 students plans to open seven schools by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants an ethnic representative, and if you do
one school at a time, there's a fight," Dolberg said. "The high school
went to the Hispanics. [It will be named for Cesar Chavez.] The
middle school went to the Chinese American community, with the name
Maxine Hong Kingston [author of 'China Men' and 'Warrior Women:
Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts,' among other books]. She was
born, raised and went to school here. One elementary school will be
named for Wilhelmina Henry, the first African American teacher in
Stockton."</TE>
<TE>   As for Bush, he said, "we didn't have any conservative names, and
Bush is a good conservative name. Mr. Bush is quite an outstanding
individual who has been underestimated in our country."</TE>
<TE>   And the more he thought about it, Dolberg said, he realized that a
Bush school could prove to be a great political opportunity for
Stockton. When the school is dedicated, the next presidential
campaign will be in full swing.</TE>
<TE>   "I engineered it so that the Bush school would be the one that
opens right away," Dolberg said. "I think there's a strong likelihood
that we will have someone from the Bush family here to see it open."</TE>
<TE>   Stockton school officials said they believe theirs will be
the first school in the nation named for the president. The White House
did not respond to requests for confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   To one school board member, Clem Lee, a Republican, the Bush name
is an expression of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an expression of the sentiment 'America Now' for me," Lee
said. "There's probably some post-9/11 stuff mixed in there. We have
a president who is facing really an unprecedented challenge. So my
vote was informed by a culmination of all those things.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the first person to admit that it might be premature to
honor a sitting president," he said. "But it's quite defensible.
We've got schools in Stockton named after Cleveland, Harrison,
Garfield, Tyler and Fillmore. These were truly mediocre presidents."</TE>
<TE>   Clarence Chan, a Democratic school board member who opposed the
name, sought to keep the controversy in perspective. "It's not so
much a partisan thing as it is just not a proper time. He hasn't
proven himself yet. He's in the middle of his term," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But to retired Marine Corps Sgt. Richard A. Pittman, the new
school names are significant. In about five years, Pittman, the only
Stockton resident to have received the Congressional Medal of Honor,
will see an elementary school in Stockton bearing his name. Pittman
was awarded the medal in 1968 for his heroism in the face of enemy
fire in Vietnam in July 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "I am absolutely flabbergasted. It's just a great, great honor,
and it's right up there with receiving the Congressional Medal of
Honor," he said. "I'm just giddy at the possibility of my
grandchildren going to a school named after their grandfather."</TE>
<TE>   As for the sitting president who also will be so honored, Pittman
said, "I'm surprised that they named a school after a living
president. And I'm just as surprised that one of the schools will be
named after a Vietnam veteran."</TE>

<HD>Breakup Backers to Seek Wider Appeal</HD>
<DH>Secession: Opposition will continue to stress the possible
pitfalls. Both sides say Valley is still the main battleground.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the anti-secession campaign say they will stick with their
strategy of highlighting the risks of a municipal breakup, while
advocates of an independent San Fernando Valley and Hollywood concede
they must do more to appeal to key groups of voters.</LD>
<LD>   A recent Los Angeles Times Poll found support for secession is
holding firm in the Valley but has slipped citywide and seems anemic
in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   "We have a message that resonates. We've got to get the message to
more people," said Richard Katz, a former assemblyman and co-chairman
of the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</LD>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn said he will keep voters focused on the
possible pitfalls of secession, and also draw attention to how City
Hall is changing to better meet their needs. When not attacking
secession as a recipe for higher taxes and reduced police protection,
the mayor has been busy holding news conferences to tout neighborhood
councils, economic development in Hollywood and plans to improve a
range of city services in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "People are noticing we are doing things differently in L.A.,"
Hahn said. "We are going to continue doing what we have been doing,
saying that L.A. is a great city and we are moving in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns say the Valley remains the main battleground in the
Nov. 5 election. Secessionists are counting on carrying the Valley
with a large enough margin to tip the citywide vote in their favor.
The poll, however, shows them short of that mark.</TE>
<TE>   It found that Valley secession is backed by 52% of voters in the
Valley and 38% of voters citywide, while Hollywood cityhood is
opposed by 61% of voters in that area. To win, the secession measures
must receive a majority of votes in the breakaway region and a second
majority citywide.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly need to carry the Valley with a strong majority,
whether it is 58% or 60%," said Frank Schubert, a political
strategist for the Valley and Hollywood secession campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers outside the Valley suggest that breakup advocates need
to do a better job explaining to voters how they would benefit from a
municipal split, said political strategist Arnold Steinberg, who
conducted a poll for the secession group Valley VOTE two years ago
but is no longer involved in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Times] survey confirms that these movements have not had a
clear, focused message," Steinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Berg, retired founder of the Unruh Institute of Politics at
USC and a Valley resident, said the message coming from the Hollywood
secessionists is even murkier. "I think Hollywood [secession] is
dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Eric Garcetti, who represents much of Hollywood
and is opposed to secession, said a key finding in the poll was that
only 10% of Hollywood residents believe the city is shortchanging
them. "We are on the right track."</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood secession leaders say they are about to broaden
their campaign, and will continue to hit hard on the theme that the
city has neglected the area. The secessionists have new offices and a
phone bank on Santa Monica Boulevard. Hollywood VOTE founder Gene La
Pietra, who is funding much of the effort, says the campaign has
about 200 volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra and Geoffrey Garfield, campaign manager for the
Hollywood Independence Committee, said they are lining up precinct
captains to organize the volunteers neighborhood by neighborhood. "To
use a Lakers' analogy, this is only the first quarter of this game,"
La Pietra said. "We have three more quarters in which to win this
thing, and we're going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   He also said the campaign will encourage voters citywide to look
at the blight in Hollywood. "Their hearts will be broken and they'll
support what we're doing," he added. "They'll see how neglected and
abused the area is, and they'll vote for for us."</TE>
<TE>   In the Valley, Laurette Healey, co-chairwoman of the secession
campaign committee, agreed a sharper pro-breakup message is needed.
She also said the poll underscored the campaign's need to do more to
reach black and Latino voters citywide, who are leaning heavily
against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not explained enough about how their lives will actually
be improved," Healey said.</TE>
<TE>   The secession proponents will work harder to convince Latinos in
the East Valley--where voters are split on secession--that the ballot
measure is an "unprecedented opportunity" to create a city in which
they would be major force, Healey said. Voter registration figures in
six of the 14 council districts in an independent Valley would favor
the election of Latino candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley secession camp will send a similar message to African
American voters in other parts of the city, Healey said.</TE>
<TE>   "The African American community has the same opportunity that
those living in the Valley have for a compressed city with more local
control," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn campaign strategist Kam Kuwata, however, said the poll made
clear that the mayor's views on secession have won over African
American and Latino voters, especially outside the Valley. "Those are
strongholds for us," Kuwata said, "but we are not going to take those
areas for granted."</TE>

<HD>Crowded Field Runs for Top Job at LAPD</HD>
<DH>Chief: The city receives dozens of inquiries within days of
posting the job, and could eventually get more than 100 applications.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The official posting for the Los Angeles police chief position went
out early last week, and within days the city received nearly 30
inquiries--including several from former department members who have
launched political-style campaigns for the job.</LD>
<LD>   City officials are expecting dozens of resumes from those seeking
to serve as the LAPD's top cop before the filing period closes July
19. The Police Commission is expected to narrow the list to the top
three candidates by the end of summer. Mayor James K. Hahn then will
make his choice, subject to City Council confirmation.</LD>
<LD>   Among those who are already actively seeking the position are: the
Portland, Ore., police chief, Mark Kroeker, a former LAPD deputy
chief who was a finalist for the job five years ago; Oxnard Police
Chief Art Lopez, also a former LAPD deputy chief; and LAPD Cmdr.
George Gascon.</LD>
<TE>   All three have for weeks been making the rounds of City Council
offices and community meetings to lobby for the position. Lopez has
even sanctioned a Web site to support his candidacy. Initially, he
also sanctioned a "testimonial" dinner to raise money for his
efforts. He later canceled the event, amid criticism that he didn't
need to raise money to apply for the job.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the campaigns, Hahn remarked dryly: "There's only
one vote." Council members, meanwhile, have found the early efforts
somewhat amusing, but not surprising.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing is clear: The chief of police position has been
political for many years," said Councilman Eric Garcetti. "It
shouldn't be a surprise that politics have entered into it. Because
of what we demand of a police chief, the chief has to have good
political skills. Management skills are not enough. It's not a bad
test for them."</TE>
<TE>   The city began looking for a new police chief in April after the
Police Commission voted to deny then-Chief Bernard Parks' request for
a second five-year term. Parks stepped down several weeks later and
is now running for the 8th Council District seat.</TE>
<TE>   The city recently hired Bob Murray and Associates to screen
applicants and forward the names of qualified candidates to the
Police Commission. On Monday, the group opened the application
process.</TE>
<TE>   City officials did not disclose the names of those who have
applied so far for the job, which pays $168,000 to $253,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have publicly expressed interest include current LAPD
Deputy Chiefs David Kalish and Margaret York and Cmdr. Jim McDonnell.
Former Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy is serving as the department's
temporary chief, with the understanding that he will not seek the
position permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook said the city is expecting more than
100 applications. "We are confident we will have more than enough
interested candidates to make the best selection," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The job announcement describes the ideal candidate as someone with
"considerable experience working with diverse communities" and in
"inspiring and motivating" officers.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Commission recently held the last of seven public
forums to gather community input on selection criteria.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard it over and over.... They want somebody who is honest
and somebody who really cares about community policing and the
reduction of crime in the many neighborhoods of Los Angeles," said
the commission resident, Rick Caruso. "They also want someone who can
improve morale, recruitment and retention."</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker, Lopez and Gascon (no relation to Deputy Chief David
Gascon) wasted no time in setting up public appearances as the
application period started.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Gascon and Lopez appeared at a breakfast meeting of
the National Alliance for Positive Action, a nonprofit advocacy
organization based in Inglewood. Kroeker had addressed the group a
week earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, the police chief is not elected," said Laura Santos,
the group's speaker coordinator. "But community members in a
democracy are entitled to hear from different public officials, and
particularly those seeking to be police chief. So we decided to
invite them."</TE>
<TE>   George Gascon--who told the group that he is intent on reforming
the Los Angeles Police Department and boosting morale--said he
welcomed the chance to get his message out.</TE>
<TE>   "The selection is not a political campaign, but it is critically
important that the public become a participant in the process," he
said. "It's important for the public to see the candidates and see
what they believe."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, who also billed himself as a community-minded fixer who can
tackle the department's tough problems, agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not looking for an endorsement," he said. "I want to be able
to have a dialogue with people on the issues they see as important."</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker said he has been meeting with city leaders and community
groups, not only to raise his profile but also to "learn what is
important to the community."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm listening, I'm studying, and I'm trying to make sure I retain
an understanding about the heart of the city and its issues, because
I've been out of town for the past four years," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kroeker called the search for a new chief "a professional
process."</TE>
<TE>   "In this process, there are stakeholders, including elected
people, appointed people and, most importantly, the mayor," he said.
"Ultimately it's the mayor who needs to have a comfort level. I
haven't spoken to him directly, but the time will come when I will."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles police officer was shot in the wrist and a fleeing
suspect was killed Saturday night on the Harbor Freeway, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The incident began when two officers saw a man they believe was
either using or dealing drugs at 79th and Figueroa streets in
Southwest Los Angeles. The officers approached the suspect, who was
sitting outside an abandoned building. There was a brief scuffle,
with the man knocking down the officers, LAPD Deputy Chief David
Gascon said. The officers suffered minor injuries.</LD>
<LD>   The man jumped into the police car and drove away, prompting the
officers to shoot at the fleeing car, witnesses and police said. The
man was not hit at that time.</LD>
<TE>   Backup officers gave chase while a police helicopter tracked the
patrol car. After a short pursuit, the man stopped on the freeway
near Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Officers fired beanbag rounds. The police did not believe the man
was armed, said Interim Police Chief Martin Pomeroy.</TE>
<TE>   Officers tried to pull him out of the police car, Pomeroy said.
Then, believing the man was reaching for a weapon, at least one of
the officers opened fire, killing him.</TE>
<TE>   About two dozen LAPD officers converged on the scene of the
shooting, which was reported at 7:36 p.m. Shortly after the shooting,
several officers huddled around a wounded colleague. Nearby, the
suspect's body lay across one of the traffic lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The Newton Division officer was taken to St. Francis Medical
Center in Lynwood, where he underwent surgery for a gunshot wound to
the wrist, authorities said. It was unclear whether he was shot by
the suspect or by one of his fellow officers, Pomeroy said. He was in
stable condition late Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Harbor Freeway was closed and traffic backed up for miles.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not release the identities of the officers
involved or the suspect.</TE>

<HD>Visa Cut Threatens Rural Clinics</HD>

<AU>LEE ROMNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WATERFORD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>This little town is lucky. When Dr. K. Krishnamoorthi arrived last
year, he became the first full-time doctor in a decade at its worn
brick clinic. Now, walk-ins are welcome. Krishnamoorthi gamely
explains every ailment from toenail fungus to heart disease in his
South Indian lilt, and even telephones patients at night to check on
their progress.</LD>
<LD>   "What I'm happy about is just feeling good about the doctors here
and not having to go to Modesto," said Carol Harrison, 53, who raises
Holstein cows nearby and was recently treated for a throat infection
and, yes, toenail fungus. A convenience for her, the shorter medical
trips are a significant comfort to her mother-in-law, who is under
Krishnamoorthi's follow-up care for heart surgery and a collapsed
lung.</LD>
<LD>   For many agricultural workers with no access to transportation,
the proximity of a physician is a vital necessity.</LD>
<TE>   The baby-faced Krishnamoorthi is part of a federal program that
has addressed a critical shortage of medical care across rural
America. Thanks to visa waivers sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, more than 3,000 foreign doctors have been assigned since
1994 to small towns.</TE>
<TE>   But the program that brought Krishnamoorthi to this Central Valley
farm town has fallen victim to the war on terrorism. Citing
post-Sept. 11 security jitters, the department announced earlier this
year that it would no longer sponsor the visa waivers.</TE>
<TE>   The decision has caused panic among rural health advocates, who
have come to depend on foreign medical graduates to hold together the
country's fragile rural health system. In some areas, the foreigners
make up more than 40% of all doctors. In California, the program has
supplied towns with 232 doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "If a federal agency is looking for a way to generate any greater
vulnerability in an already under-resourced rural health system, this
is a great way to do it," said Nancy Oliva, a public health
consultant and board member for the Oak Valley Hospital District,
which includes Waterford. "We rely on an international manpower
pool."</TE>
<TE>   Krishnamoorthi works in Waterford because a two-year search by the
clinic's owner yielded not a single American-trained doctor. Six of
the last eight doctors recruited to Waterford and the surrounding
towns of Oakdale, Riverbank and Escalon have been foreign medical
graduates granted special visa waivers. Among them were a
pediatrician from Peru, doctors from the Philippines, one doctor from
Syria and another from Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   So-called J-1 visas require doctors to return to their home
countries after they have completed their residencies, but thousands
have received waivers allowing them to stay if they hang their
shingles in underserved areas for three years. U.S. graduates tend to
shun small towns because of long hours, antiquated hospital
technology and a dearth of cultural activities.</TE>
<TE>   But doctors from poorer, more unstable parts of the world have a
different take on rural America. It is, after all, America. And the
stints in the country significantly increase their chances of
permanent residency here.</TE>
<TE>   To Krishnamoorthi, 35, the Central Valley's hot weather and
seasonal harvests are reminiscent of Mangalore, the southern coastal
town of fruits and flowers where he grew up. He and his wife, Soma,
who is a doctor at a sister clinic in the nearby town of Escalon, are
eager to stay. Three-year-old Mahima--born in the Bronx while the
Krishnamoorthis completed medical residencies at Lincoln
Hospital--plays in a rambling park across the street from the
family's ample Modesto home. Another baby is on the way.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beneficial for everyone," said Krishnamoorthi. "I can have
the American Dream. At the same time, I can serve a small community.
We are thankful for life."</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration task force is reviewing the program in
response to an outcry from rural health advocates. The USDA decision
has set off a discussion on how to balance national security concerns
with the needs of rural Americans who are typically poorer, older and
sicker than the population as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "For certain rural communities, the only physician available for
hundreds of miles will be a J-1 visa waiver doctor," said Alan
Morgan, vice president of governmental affairs for the National Rural
Health Assn., which is lobbying for the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services to take over sponsorship of the waivers or, barring
that, for the USDA to reconsider. "It's had a tremendous impact."</TE>
<TE>   Any federal agency can sponsor an unlimited number of the waivers,
but since 1994 the USDA had taken the lead, accommodating doctors
mostly from India, Pakistan, the Philippines and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   A separate waiver program, sponsored by the states, has brought
2,000 additional doctors into underserved rural and urban areas since
1998. But, coincidentally, that program expired on June 1 and must be
reauthorized by Congress. Pending bills that would extend and expand
the states' program have bipartisan support and are expected to pass.</TE>
<TE>   California began participating in that program only this year,
days before the USDA slammed its doors. The Department of Health
Services was inundated with applications and filled its 20-doctor
quota quickly. Most of the doctors are headed for rural towns,
including the Central Valley's Los Banos and Dos Palos. But Health
Services will also be sending doctors to several urban clinics--not
allowed under USDA guidelines--and providing desperately needed
psychiatrists to the counties of Fresno, Merced and Tulare.</TE>
<TE>   There are many more remote places than Waterford (population
6,924), which is just 15 miles from the relative bustle of Modesto.
But the two-lane road to Modesto can make for an agonizing journey
for the sick.</TE>
<TE>   Waterford recruited Krishnamoorthi before the USDA decision, so
its clinic will be fully staffed for two more years and possibly
longer, if the Krishnamoorthis settle here permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby Oakdale wasn't so lucky.</TE>
<TE>   The town's sole pediatrician, Polish-born Dr. Krystyna Belski,
lost her Peruvian partner, a J-1 visa waiver doctor, earlier this
year to Modesto when his medical group pulled out for business
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Belski was on the verge of hiring a Salvadoran-born specialist in
pediatric infectious diseases on a J-1 visa, when the USDA pulled out
of the program. She now rattles around in the large private clinic
that she leases, on call seven days a week. Many of her
Spanish-speaking patients have stopped coming, driving instead to
Modesto or making do with a physician's assistant at a public clinic.
On a recent Friday, one patient with a vomiting toddler brought in
her 8-year-old son to translate. But Belski must often resort to AT&amp;T
phone translators, costly for her and cumbersome for patients.</TE>
<TE>   The original intent of the J-1 visas was to provide residency
training to foreign medical graduates, then send them back to serve
their underdeveloped home countries. But as a physician shortage
flared in the 1970s, more J-1 recipients received permission to stay,
said Thomas R. Konrad, who directs the program on health professions
and primary care at the University of North Carolina's Sheps Center
for Health Services Research.</TE>
<TE>   But the program has been dogged by political tensions.
Organizations representing U.S. medical graduates have strongly
objected whenever there appeared to be more than enough U.S.-trained
doctors.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Health and Human Services decided to sponsor the
waivers only for researchers. But rural areas were going without
service and, in 1994, the USDA stepped in. The states followed suit
four years later.</TE>
<TE>   Whether there is a nationwide glut or shortage of doctors remains
a topic of hot debate in academic and policy circles. But shortages
in rural areas have persisted for decades. Even with financial
incentives, it's difficult to attract U.S. medical graduates to such
areas.</TE>
<TE>   The new reality of stricter visa policies now has health experts
looking harder at domestic alternatives. The Bush administration has
proposed increasing the National Health Service Corps. budget from
$99 million to $143 million next year. That program pays off loans
and provides scholarships to U.S.-trained doctors who serve in
shortage areas, but has fluctuated along with federal budgets.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by the Rural Policy Research Center suggested
expanding programs to attract rural youths to the medical profession.
The report also proposes stricter security measures, in hopes of
saving the visa waiver program.</TE>
<TE>   "In the near term, it's an absolutely vital role that
international medical graduates play," said Keith J. Mueller, the
report's main author. "The future could be different."</TE>
<TE>   Here in Waterford, Krishnamoorthi has been welcomed--although at
times clumsily. Patients had so much trouble with his last name that
he shortened it to Moorthi on the clinic sign. He tolerates his
truncated identity, and the mispronunciations, with good humor.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife have adapted easily, but they are not pioneers.
Photographs of other foreign medical graduates fill the pages of the
county's medical society directory. Among them is Indian-born Dr.
Brij Gupta, the Krishnamoorthis' boss.</TE>
<TE>   The Krishnamoorthis live one block from Gupta, rounding out a
small community of more than half a dozen Indian-born doctors in the
region. Modesto offers two Indian supermarkets and two Punjabi
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Rural doctoring suits the Krishnamoorthis. They are honing the
Spanish they learned during their residencies in the Bronx. And there
is a warmth here that they did not always experience in New York,
where they treated hostile patients suffering from addiction or
mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   "The patients know that I'm expecting a baby and that my husband's
a doctor, and they ask about me," said Soma, 32. "That's the
difference between here and a big city. We want to settle down here."</TE>

<HD>Displaced Tenants Still Feel Aftershocks of Explosion</HD>
<DH>Housing: Residents have been unable to retrieve belongings
from the damaged Encino complex and are struggling to meet the costs
of resettling.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Juanita Hill, 72, lies awake at night worrying about how she and her
son, Daniel, 48, are going to come up with an extra $200 a month to
pay the rent on an apartment they had to lease after their unit in
the Park Encino housing complex was severely damaged in a fiery blast
six weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Plumber Dror Senderov, 66, struggles to make out what people are
saying after he suffered partial hearing loss in both ears as a
result of the explosion, caused by a tenant's attempt to fix a
natural gas stove, which resulted in that man's death.</LD>
<LD>   Bank teller Shoereh Rashidsarokhi, 37, wonders how she will
fulfill her dream of becoming a full-time graphic artist without the
computer equipment she had to leave behind when she and 300 other
residents fled their homes after the May 24 incident, which caused $5
million in damage to the building and its contents.</LD>
<TE>   Although the residents said they are grateful to be alive, some,
such as Rashidsarokhi, said they feel as if their world has been
turned upside down.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been working all my life trying to make it," she said.
"All of a sudden, I am put outside my door with nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Rashidsarokhi said her once stable life has turned nomadic. She
lived in a motel for three weeks and now rents a room month to month.
Even putting together outfits suitable to wear to the office is a
chore.</TE>
<TE>   "All of my stuff is in there," she said, referring to her former
studio apartment at Park Encino. "I don't know whether I should buy
new things or whether I will be able to get my own stuff. I am just
waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Her former neighbor, Hill, who suffers from chronic fatigue
syndrome and a degenerative muscle disorder, said she has lost many
nights' sleep wondering how she and her son, a sign maker, will pay
the $1,162 rent on their new Lindley Avenue apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "We made the rent this month, but what about next month?" she
said, choking back tears. "I am so upset by the whole thing. I
haven't been able to do anything--I'm too stressed."</TE>
<TE>   Christina Cogan, 19, and her husband, Carlos Cordova, 23, are
trying to make a home for their 2-year-old daughter in an apartment
with few pieces of furniture and no toys or a TV.</TE>
<TE>   "I stay home all day. I don't have anything. My daughter doesn't
have anything to do," said Cogan, who is expecting the couple's
second child in September. "I hope to be out of this situation by the
time the baby comes."</TE>
<TE>   Her former neighbors, Senderov and his wife, Margarita, moved
Thursday to a new apartment, after sleeping on the floor of a
friend's apartment for a month. They still go to their friend's home
for meals because all their cookware is still at Park Encino, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are like gypsies," Senderov said.</TE>
<TE>   Senderov said he had come home for lunch May 24 and was parking
his truck in front of the 130-unit apartment complex in the 5300
block of Newcastle Avenue in Encino when the building exploded.</TE>
<TE>   He grabbed his cell phone, punched in his phone number and yelled
to his wife to get out of the building. The couple found each other
on the street amid firetrucks, police cars and other traumatized
residents.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, he and his wife just want to collect their
belongings and move on.</TE>
<TE>   But, along with the other tenants, they have been kept out of the
complex by security guards because of asbestos contamination.</TE>
<TE>   "All my furniture is in the old apartment," he said, "but they
won't let me take it because of asbestos. The refrigerator and pots
and pans--we should be able to take them. We can wash them with soap
and water."</TE>
<TE>   South Coast Air Quality Management District officials have
determined that portions of the apartment complex are contaminated
with asbestos, agency spokesman Sam Atwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Asbestos, a fiber used as a fire retardant and insulator, was
outlawed in the mid-1970s after studies showed exposure could cause
cancer and other diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The material was found in a collapsed section of the building
containing nine units, as well as in fire doors, acoustic ceilings,
stucco and other areas of the three-story building, Atwood said.</TE>
<TE>   Property owner Avi Rojany and GLE Group, an El Segundo-based
construction company, have filed plans, approved by the air quality
district, for asbestos removal from the building.</TE>
<TE>   David Bahng, a construction consultant at GLE Group, said a
meeting is planned for Monday to hammer out the details.</TE>
<TE>   Former residents say Rojany has not told them whether they will be
able to retrieve their belongings or move back. Six former tenants
have filed a lawsuit in Small Claims Court, asking for the return of
their security deposits and reimbursement for relocation costs.
Rojany could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The American Red Cross of Greater Los Angeles provided vouchers
for temporary housing, food, clothing, toiletries and household items
to 114 families and continues to assist 20 families, spokeswoman
Brenda V. Castillo said. Elderly residents also received assistance
to replace medication, eyeglasses and medical equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Seven residents have applied for low-interest loans, which can be
used for resettlement costs. The loans are administered by the city
of Los Angeles from funds provided by the federal Small Business
Administration, said Anna Burton, a spokeswoman for the city's
Department of Emergency Preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, welder Shemon Baharouzi, 45, said more needs to be done
to assist displaced residents, especially now that the incident is
fading from public attention.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, everyone was out here willing to help, but now
we feel forgotten," he said. "They give billions of dollars to help
people overseas, but there is nothing for us. It's frustrating."</TE>

<HD>John Frankenheimer, 72; Director Was Master of the
Political Thriller</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER and SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Frankenheimer, the director best known for the classic political
thriller "The Manchurian Candidate" but who was equally successful in
television's Golden Age and, more recently, making films for cable,
died Saturday morning. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   He died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles of
complications from a stroke following recent spinal surgery, a
publicist for HBO announced.</LD>
<LD>   Frankenheimer was part of a group of filmmakers that included
Franklin Schaffner, Sidney Lumet and George Roy Hill who started in
live television and forged influential careers in film. By the time
Frankenheimer was 30, he had received five Emmy nominations for live
dramas.</LD>
<TE>   He brought innovative camera work and a strong sense of moral
justice to his early efforts on the big screen in films that included
"The Young Savages," "The Birdman of Alcatraz," "All Fall Down," "The
Manchurian Candidate," "Seven Days in May," "Seconds" and "The
Train."</TE>
<TE>   "Frankenheimer developed in live television a kind of visceral and
highly energized way of filmmaking," said director Frank Pierson,
current president of the Board of Directors of the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences. "It gave us a new way of looking at film.
He really changed the language of film."</TE>
<TE>   As one Times reporter noted some years ago: "You won't find much
romance or many complex leading ladies in a Frankenheimer film: For
the most part his characters are men, real men, fighting each other
or some outside force trying to destroy a way of life. His films are
known for their biting look at this country's political and social
times."</TE>
<TE>   But despite his early success, Frankenheimer's career went into
sharp decline in the 1970s and '80s, when he made a series of films
that were both critical and commercial failures.</TE>
<TE>   He battled depression after the 1968 assassination of Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy, a close friend, and later alcoholism. He moved to France
for a number of years and studied cooking.</TE>
<TE>   With the re-release of "The Manchurian Candidate" in 1988, 26
years after its initial release, however, a critical reappraisal of
his work brought him new opportunities, this time doing films for
cable outlets such as Turner Network Television and HBO.</TE>
<TE>   He made the most of those opportunities, winning Emmys in 1994 for
HBO's drama on the uprising at the New York prison Attica, "Against
the Wall"; in 1995 for "The Burning Season" on the life of Brazilian
environmentalist Chico Mendes, also on HBO; and in 1996 for the TNT
miniseries "Andersonville," about the Civil War prison. In 1998, he
won for the TNT miniseries, "George Wallace."</TE>
<TE>   His most recent HBO movie, "Path to War," on Lyndon Johnson and
the Vietnam War, has received strong reviews. Also among his later
work was "Ronin," in 1998, which starred Robert De Niro.</TE>
<TE>   Frankenheimer was born in New York City, the son of a Jewish
stockbroker, and was raised Catholic by his Irish American mother.</TE>
<TE>   At one time he wanted to be a priest, but later he was drawn into
drama and attended Williams College with the thought of being an
actor.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation with a degree in English in 1951, he did some
small theater before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force. Assigned to a
photographic service squadron in Burbank, he directed a documentary
film about asphalt and another about a cattle ranch.</TE>
<TE>   He knew he wanted to make films when he was discharged in 1953, so
he returned to New York City and talked his way into a job at CBS as
an assistant director. His early work was on weather, news and sports
programs. He later did segments of Edward R. Murrow's celebrity
interview program "Person to Person," and dramatizations of
historical events in news format on "You Are There" and "See It Now."</TE>
<TE>   He was seen as a bright, up-and-coming director and was given
chances to direct live television dramas on "Playhouse 90" and other
anthology series. He was steadily employed in this capacity,
directing 152 dramas.</TE>
<TE>   He got Ingrid Bergman to do "Turn of the Screw," her first
television role in America, in 1959. She won an Emmy for that
performance. He made "Days of Wine and Roses," a riveting look at
alcoholism, for CBS' "Playhouse 90."</TE>
<TE>   "It was very exciting," Frankenheimer once told a Times reporter.
"If they had live television right now, I'd still be doing it. You
had total control as a director. It was live, so we had the final
cut. And you had no such thing as a difficult actor."</TE>
<TE>   He turned to the big screen in 1957 with the theatrical version of
one of his television dramas, "The Young Stranger," starring James
MacArthur. But he found the experience not particularly rewarding and
went back to television.</TE>
<TE>   The year that really put Frankenheimer on the map as a filmmaker
was 1962.</TE>
<TE>   He made "The Birdman of Alcatraz" with Burt Lancaster, the first
of five films that the two men would make together.</TE>
<TE>   Critics noted that Frankenheimer got an unusually restrained but
highly effective performance from Lancaster, who earned an Academy
Award nomination for best actor. "I think we fulfilled a need for
each other," Frankenheimer commented to the Washington Post on his
relationship with Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted a director who was technically adept and didn't waste a
lot of time, because Burt was not a time-waster. He hated profligate
waste, and I was kind of a lean, mean director and still am, and he
liked that. I needed an actor who could get in there and do it and
who was an example. We were very, very close."</TE>
<TE>   That became a hallmark of Frankenheimer's career: working well
with most actors.</TE>
<TE>   "He got the best out of the actors--but he was a demanding
director," said Jack Shea, former president of the Directors Guild of
America and a longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not saying that as critical." Shea said. "It is wonderful to
be able to do that, and the actors loved working with him."</TE>
<TE>   "The Manchurian Candidate," the dark thriller about a communist
conspiracy to take control of the U.S. government, came out the same
year but drew a mixed reaction when it was released.</TE>
<TE>   After "Seven Days in May," another political thriller, was
released in 1964, Frankenheimer seemed firmly entrenched as a top
director in Hollywood. A year later he made his first color film, the
car-racing saga "Grand Prix."</TE>
<TE>   Always politically liberal, Frankenheimer spent part of 1968
working on Kennedy's presidential campaign, acting as director of
campaign spots.</TE>
<TE>   But after Kennedy's assassination, Frankenheimer developed what he
later called "a severe case of burnout."</TE>
<TE>   "I was 38 years old, and my world was over as I knew it,"
Frankenheimer told the Washington Post some time back.</TE>
<TE>   He spent several years in France, where he studied cooking at the
Cordon Bleu, emerging as a gourmet chef. He also developed what he
later conceded was a severe drinking problem, which harmed his
filmmaking.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a drinking problem," he told the New York Times. "It took a
toll on me. And the state of mind you're in when you have a problem
like that, even when you're not drunk, is the most dangerous time.
Because you make decisions that are not in your best interests--about
your life, about your career choices and everything."</TE>
<TE>   Frankenheimer stopped drinking in 1981, but by then the quality
filmmaking work had pretty much stopped as well.</TE>
<TE>   But when "The Manchurian Candidate" was re-released in 1988,
critics rushed to dub it an American classic, and a reappraisal of
Frankenheimer's work began.</TE>
<TE>   "This picture may be the most sophisticated political satire ever
made in Hollywood," said the late New Yorker film critic Pauline
Kael.</TE>
<TE>   "It's done me a lot of good," Frankenheimer said at the time.
"Anytime people say you've directed a classic--well, most people
haven't directed anything that, 20 years later, they want to be
remembered for."</TE>
<TE>   A tall man with piercing blue yes, a loud, distinctive voice and a
shock of white hair, Frankenheimer had a strong personality.</TE>
<TE>   "As a friend," said Pierson, "he was tough-minded, opinionated,
forceful and could get very angry. He was great fun to fight with."</TE>
<TE>   Angela Lansbury, who appeared in two films for Frankenheimer, "All
Fall Down" and "The Manchurian Candidate"--for which she received a
best supporting actress nomination as Laurence Harvey's politically
ambitious mother--was shocked to learn of Frankenheimer's death
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have lost a wonderful champion of our business," she said, "He
was such a good man. I am deeply saddened. It is so unexpected."</TE>
<TE>   Frankenheimer is survived by his wife of 41 years, Evans; two
daughters, Elise Riggs and Kristi Frankenheimer; a grandson, Dylan
Frankenheimer; a sister, Jean Hieber; and a brother, Richard
Frankenheimer.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for a memorial service are pending.</TE>

<DH>Kaiser Bellflower's annual Hearts at Work day of
volunteerism cheers helpers almost as much as those they help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This Saturday morning started for Dr. Marty Gilbert with him flipping
pancakes for 600 people gathered at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower
Medical Center, where he is the medical director and chief of staff.</LD>
<LD>   After helping feed the large crowd of other doctors, nurses,
hospital staff and even their families, Gilbert headed into the
hospital parking lot to help lead a session in painting ceramics for
handicapped children.</LD>
<LD>   One of the children he guided in her painting was a 7-year-old
girl born with no legs, the victim of a drug-addicted mother and now
in foster care.</LD>
<TE>   On this bright sunny day, Gilbert was not the only Kaiser
Bellflower staffer here to do good deeds. The breakfast kicked off a
much-anticipated day for the Kaiser Bellflower staff: their annual
Hearts at Work day of volunteerism.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the day, the hundreds of volunteers who enjoyed
Gilbert's pancakes would scatter throughout southeast Los Angeles
County to paint houses, repair kitchens, build a playground and a
garden--for the needy, the elderly, a church and a public school.</TE>
<TE>   Days of volunteerism are a popular tool among institutions, such
as churches, synagogues, businesses and nonprofit groups, which once
a year venture out into the community to do their share in improving
the quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   At Kaiser, the children's ceramics session was just one of 11
community service projects the hospital staff carried out during
this, the sixth year of the event.</TE>
<TE>   Community service has a strong influence on the Kaiser Bellflower
family of doctors and staff, Gilbert said. The elaborate Hearts at
Work day grew out of smaller community service projects the staff
used to perform.</TE>
<TE>   "We have 400 physicians. Most of us live in communities outside of
this area, but we spend 40 to 50 hours in the community," said
Gilbert, who lives in the hills above Hollywood's Sunset Strip. "Most
of us like to give back to the communities in which we work."</TE>
<TE>   After the breakfast, about half of the crowd went on a 2-kilometer
walk to raise funds for "999 for Kids," a support program for
children with physical and mental problems. It is sponsored by the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. During the breakfast, the
hospital already had presented the group with a $5,000 check.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the volunteers got in van shuttles to their assigned
projects in communities such as Huntington Park, Norwalk, Bellflower
and Bell. One shuttle arrived just before 9 a.m. at Olympia Orozco's
modest home in Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital works with community contacts, such as social workers
or social service agencies, to get referrals for projects.</TE>
<TE>   The coordinator of the parent center at Huntington Park High
School, which Orozco's twin 17-year-old daughters attend, had visited
Orozco before and seen the falling sink in her kitchen and the holes
in the cabinets.</TE>
<TE>   Orozco, 52, and her husband, Luis, 65, bought the house in 1980
and had never made a repair. She made little in sewing and he was
recently laid off from his job at a factory that makes car rims.</TE>
<TE>   The parent center coordinator asked the hospital to consider the
Orozcos' home as a Hearts at Work project, which is how on this day
15 volunteers descended on it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get tired of thanking God," Orozco said as the swarm went
to work.</TE>
<TE>   Inside her kitchen, Don Buma--who works in Kaiser's facilities
department--got to work on the cabinets and sink. Carole Jurado, a
physician scheduler, painted the walls around Buma while nurses
Candice Rogers and Linda Wolff rolled a new coat of white paint on
the dining room walls.</TE>
<TE>   Many staff at the hospital look forward to the yearly Hearts at
Work day.</TE>
<TE>   For Cathy Buddemeyer of Downey, administrator of the internal
medicine and family practice at Kaiser's Imperial medical offices,
it's one of those important events that mark the time of year for her
family: Easter, Mother's Day, Hearts at Work.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, in fact, she brings her two sons to help out. Sean, 15,
and Corey, 13, painted the house's exterior walls a light green
alongside their mother.</TE>
<TE>   "We went into medicine because we like to help people," Cathy
Buddemeyer said. "This is a very concrete way to make a difference in
somebody's life."</TE>
<TE>   Miles away, another crew arrived at Sam and Agnes Latino's home in
Bellflower to landscape and paint their home's exterior.</TE>
<TE>   Agnes, 73, has been in a wheelchair for years. She's diabetic,
suffered a stroke and endured heart surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Sam, who at 79 is too frail to withstand the hip replacement that
he needs, hobbles around the house not much faster than Agnes can get
around.</TE>
<TE>   The volunteers came to their rescue partly because Agnes is
well-known at Kaiser, where she volunteers feeding data into
computers.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the greatest of volunteers," Sam said proudly of his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything I can do in a wheelchair," she said, with an embarrassed
laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Recently she got a plaque from the hospital for her volunteer
work. Volunteering is not new for Agnes, who as far back as the 1950s
went door-to-door collecting money for the March of Dimes and its
work to fight polio.</TE>
<TE>   Now she's the beneficiary of others' good will.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than painting the house," Agnes Latino said. "It brings
up your spirits."</TE>
<TE>   Hearts at Work's other projects this day included building a
playground at the Good Day preschool run by the Huntington Park
Community Church and a science garden at Dolores Huerta Elementary
School in Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   And this year, like every year, Hearts at Work offered the
hospital staff a chance to take its mission of helping people beyond
the hospital's walls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a root of why most of us went into medicine," said Gilbert,
the hospital's administrator. "We have a tool, we have skills, we
have means and we like to use those to better the community and the
people that live in the community."</TE>

<HD>How Low Can Our Culture's Ethics Sink Before They Hit
Bottom?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you could take all the bank robbers, stick-up artists and con men
of the last century and put them in a room together, do you know what
you'd have?</LD>
<LD>   Pikers, says ethicist Michael Josephson of Marina del Rey. They
were low achievers compared to the cabal of corporate thieves who
have recently fleeced investors and ravaged the American economy.</LD>
<LD>   If you've got a 401(k) or other retirement fund, chances are
you've had your pocket picked.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a watershed time," Josephson said when I checked in with
him to ask when and how we became a society without scruples. "It's
huge, and it's still unfolding."</TE>
<TE>   I met Josephson in the mid-'80s and have listened since then to
his do-the-right-thing radio commentaries, which end with a line that
seems inspired by the straight-and-narrow dad on "The Brady Bunch":
"This is Michael Josephson reminding you that character counts."</TE>
<TE>   I always picture an entire nation of people jerking their hands
out of cookie jars when they hear Josephson's voice. But apparently
the commentaries are blacked out in the boardrooms of WorldCom,
Xerox, Enron, Rite-Aid, Adelphia, Global Crossing and Arthur
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, a new chapter in the Book of Lies.</TE>
<TE>   Last week in The Times, we had a developing scandal involving
allegations that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power drove
up prices with an illegal trick that's used so routinely, it's got a
name--ricochet.</TE>
<TE>   We had a report that Warner-Lambert Co., maker of a diabetes drug
that has figured in the deaths of dozens, pushed the drug on Latinos
in part because "the Hispanic patient is easy to intimidate."</TE>
<TE>   And we had hospital officials awkwardly attempting to explain why
they didn't bother to tell relatives of two patients, who both died,
that their loved ones had Legionnaires' disease.</TE>
<TE>   The name of the hospital?</TE>
<TE>   Good Samaritan.</TE>
<TE>   I've written fiction, but I've never come up with story lines this
creative. How could anybody make up anything more absurd than real
life at a time when Catholic bishops and cardinals are taking
management tips from the tobacco industry?</TE>
<TE>   Major league baseball players are launching home runs over the
moon and telling us they're not on steroids, and we're about to go on
another bombing-for-oil mission that we'll call a blow for democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Asking when it all started is like asking the causes of the Civil
War," says Josephson. "Everyone wants one coherent theory."</TE>
<TE>   Of course we do. And I'd like to blame it on the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Milli Vanilli and REO Speedwagon were hit bands, yuppies became
the standard bearers for human achievement, and not only did
President Reagan promise prosperity without sacrifice, but he
preached family values while estranged from his own children.</TE>
<TE>   Of course it's just as easy to blame our current mess on President
Clinton, who taught us you weren't guilty of anything unless you got
caught, and even then, you could probably weasel your way out of
trouble, depending on your definition of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But Josephson says it was more complicated than any of that. He
points to a time when the dreaded phrase "cost-benefit analysis"
became the driving force behind every vital decision. That was when
principle became considered too expensive a luxury and had to be let
go.</TE>
<TE>   "A huge contributing factor was a change in the standard of
accounting ethics. It became a bottom-line mentality that says
whatever works is right," Josephson says.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is gamed now, and the challenge is, 'How do I beat the
system?' Tax evasion is a crime, but tax avoidance isn't. We have
learned to avoid laws by finding ways around them, and paying people
lots of money to tell us how to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   At some point, that ethic moved beyond boardrooms and wormed its
way into the culture, and we all danced on the edge of a slippery
slope. When the average Joe became an investor, for instance, did he
care what the company stood for, as long as it was returning 20%
profits?</TE>
<TE>   More students are cheating on exams and college applications,
Josephson says, but no one is all that worked up about it. Certainly
not anyone whose kid got accepted to a good school.</TE>
<TE>   NBA teams pull their own "ricochet" scams with rosters, shuffling
players onto the reserve list with bogus injuries. But if the team is
winning, who cares?</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it that people don't even get offended when they know top
basketball teams are totally willing to sign a document that's a
lie?" Josephson asks in the incredulous tone of the last honest man
on the planet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're [in trouble] the moment we start making it look like there
are shades of gray when telling little lies, because why shouldn't it
be that way for big lies too?"</TE>
<TE>   Fair enough, we're all in on it.</TE>
<TE>   But I'd like to make a distinction between the small lies we
average folks tell ourselves, and the act of making billion-dollar
accounting "mistakes," running a corporation into the ground, costing
thousands of people their jobs, and wiping out pensioners' savings.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, you cook the books on your personal income tax returns,
and you're in deep trouble. But the CEO just flashes his Get-Out-of-</TE>
<TE>   Jail-Free card, walks away with $200 million in bonuses, and
remodels the 45-room mansion.</TE>
<TE>   Josephson says we can't sink too much deeper before we hit rock
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   And the good news is that some accounting reforms and beefed-up
regulatory scrutiny may be on the way, now that CEOs--and the pols
who let them get away with grand larceny--have become objects of
public ridicule and contempt.</TE>
<TE>   I'll believe it when I see it.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, this is Steve Lopez for Michael Josephson, reminding
you that character counts.</TE>

<DH>Activism: The Agoura Hills woman who started the battle to
block Ahmanson Ranch now has reinforcements, but stays on the front
lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Rob Reiner, Martin Sheen or Erin Brockovich rallied against
the Ahmanson Ranch project last fall, one small woman with a keen
mind and a righteous anger declared the proposed mini-city a recipe
for environmental disaster.</LD>
<LD>   Today, actor-director Reiner carries the anti-Ahmanson mantle most
prominently. Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn recently joined the
campaign.</LD>
<LD>   But it was Mary Wiesbrock, a college-educated stay-at-home mom,
who started the fight against the 3,050-home project in the rugged
Simi Hills overlooking the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   And the Agoura Hills activist helped keep it alive until a potent
alliance of politicians, environmentalists and celebrities joined the
fray.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 10 years after approval of the golf course community by the
Ventura County Board of Supervisors, its future remains in doubt,
despite pledges by ranch owner Washington Mutual Bank to break ground
in 2003. Ventura County officials are weighing the adequacy of a new
environmental study, and Hahn is threatening a lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   While the merits of the Ahmanson Ranch plan are still debated
angrily, there is little dispute that the tireless Wiesbrock--a
trained teacher, biologist and laboratory technologist--made a big
difference in this arduous longshot campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I give Mary a lot of credit," said planning expert and author
William Fulton, who has analyzed the Ahmanson deal. "She has
repeatedly changed the terms of the debate. It's not built, because
she kept opposing it until she got friends."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County planner Dennis Hawkins made the same point at a
recent public hearing, giving backhanded praise to Wiesbrock for
repeatedly pressing him to test an Ahmanson Ranch water well she
thinks might be contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as it pains me to agree with Mary Wiesbrock ... we're
supporting additional examination to put this issue to bed," Hawkins
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire her tenacity," he added. "She's been there at every
hearing for 13 years, always pushing her concerns. Sometimes we
haven't agreed with her because of lack of evidence, but she's been
there fighting the good fight."</TE>
<TE>   But the fight has changed, according to Wiesbrock. "Ahmanson Ranch
has become a regional, statewide and national issue," she said. "It's
gone to a higher level."</TE>
<TE>   The $2-billion development by the savings and loan has come to
symbolize the push and pull between California's need to ease its
housing crisis and a growing grass-roots movement to preserve the
state's dwindling open space.</TE>
<TE>   The seeds of the struggle were planted in 1989, when Wiesbrock
helped pull together Save Open Space to protect the mountains that
separate the sprawl of Los Angeles from the leafy commuter towns of
eastern Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   That group of activist homeowners hoped to block not only the
Ahmanson Ranch community, but a second huge country club project that
comic Bob Hope planned for his Jordan Ranch two canyons away.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, Wiesbrock and her husband, Frederick, now a retired oil
company manager, moved into a four-bedroom tract home in Agoura
Hills, where they raised four children and sent them to college.</TE>
<TE>   Their new house was an easy one-mile hike over a ridge to Hope's
old cattle ranch. It was five miles, as the crow flies, from Ahmanson
Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw the worsening traffic and air quality," Wiesbrock
recalled, "and after years of working in homeowners associations, I
had come to realize we needed a regional group."</TE>
<TE>   So Wiesbrock, 55, the daughter of a nuclear physicist who
challenged the use of atomic weapons after retiring from the Oak
Ridge Nuclear Laboratory, took that same spirit to try to save the
open space around her.</TE>
<TE>   In Wiesbrock's own campaign, she recruited Maria VanderKolk of
Thousand Oaks, a naive but articulate 25-year-old toy marketer, who
in a stunning upset won a seat on the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year, VanderKolk and a staff headed by a leading Ventura
County environmentalist had fashioned a deal they considered a unique
opportunity to protect large swaths of open space forever.</TE>
<TE>   With then-Gov. Pete Wilson's encouragement, they consolidated the
Hope and Ahmanson projects onto one-half of Ahmanson Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   By late 1992, however, both the Ventura County Planning Commission
and the county planning staff had opposed the project, citing its
severe environmental effects and its precedent-setting potential for
development of other open space in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   When the Board of Supervisors approved it anyway, an outraged
Wiesbrock declared VanderKolk a traitor to the environmental cause.
"This is a story of betrayal and greed," Wiesbrock said after the
supervisors' 4-1 vote. Hope eventually got about $57 million for his
land, nearly half from parks agencies and the rest from developers.
The ranches are now part of the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area and the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.</TE>
<TE>   Save Open Space lost four lawsuits trying to block construction,
and surrounding cities and Los Angeles County lost numerous others.</TE>
<TE>   Wiesbrock maintains Ahmanson Ranch is a bad deal. The public would
have obtained the parklands anyway, she argues, because they either
were so rugged they could not be developed or were zoned as open
space.</TE>
<TE>   Tim McGarry, a spokesman for Washington Mutual, said Wiesbrock has
single-mindedly pursued her objectives while ignoring California's
housing crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The hallmark of Mary's thinking seems to be an exclusive focus on
open space preservation with no serious consideration of other social
needs," he said. "We think that Ahmanson Ranch should be judged on
how well it balances open space and the need for new housing."</TE>
<TE>   To solve California's housing crisis, Wiesbrock said, developers
should rebuild blighted urban areas, not sprawl onto sensitive ranch
lands. "As long as we can save that land, I'm going to fight for it,"
she said. "It's a treasure of natural resources all in one place, and
when it's gone, it's gone with the wind, never to be recaptured."</TE>

<TE>   And perhaps Irish luck too. In an odd coincidence, Wiesbrock's

the potential for a catastrophic nuclear tornado.</TE>

<HD>Sensitive Tract Where Homes Plan Won't Die</HD>
<DH>Growth: State and federal wildlife officials thought
Saddleback Meadows had been saved from development. County is poised
to OK 299 homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Environmentalists liken the 20-year saga of fighting development of
Saddleback Meadows, in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains, to
the plot of a horror film. Just when they think they have finally
killed off any chance of major construction on the ecologically
sensitive 230-acre property, the proposals rise from the grave.</LD>
<LD>   The first plan died when the landowner went bankrupt. After new
owners took over, their plans were met with lawsuits by opponents,
which indefinitely delayed progress on the proposals. Opponents also
offered to buy the land for a park, using private and government
money.</LD>
<LD>   But negotiations to buy the property collapsed and the developer
avoided court action by filing new environmental reports. Saddleback
Meadows is the only remaining wildlife link between two of the
nation's biggest urban conservation districts, connecting tens of
thousands of acres of open space.</LD>
<TE>   Now development prospects have been reborn in the form of a thick
county environmental report that says building 299 homes meshes with
the county's land-use vision for the site.</TE>
<TE>   It's a conclusion that has environmentalists sputtering and some
government experts concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a key wildlife corridor connection," said Bill Tippets,
environmental program manager for the state Department of Fish and
Game. "It is very valuable because of the species on site and the
critical role it plays in connecting the two large areas."</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback Meadows is home to such rare or endangered species as
gnatcatchers, fairy shrimp and the cactus wren. It has vernal ponds
that biologists say are unlike any in the country, significant
coastal sage scrub and oak trees that are hundreds of years old.</TE>
<TE>   The parcel's owner, California Quartet of Sacramento, says that if
conservationists wanted to stop development, they should have forked
over the cash when they had the chance. The company entered into an
agreement to sell the property to a coalition of wildlife agencies
and conservation groups for $12.2 million in June 1998. The deal
unraveled at the last minute, with each side blaming the other.</TE>
<TE>   "We invested years and significant financial resources negotiating
with the county and private parties for the acquisition of the
property, only to have private parties back out of signed
agreements," said company spokesman Jason Grange. "At this point, we
regard any further proposals as nothing more than a delaying tactic."</TE>
<TE>   The next key decision rests with the county, which will take up
California Quartet's proposal in the fall. If past actions are any
guide, officials will probably approve the project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, the county approved plans for 705 mobile homes on the
land--a zoning designation that still stands.</TE>
<TE>   And in 1999, the county approved an earlier plan for 299 homes on
the site over the objections of state and federal agencies, a
decision thrown out by the courts after the environmental studies
were found to be inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say they are perplexed by the county's willingness to
clear the way for large-scale development on the property.</TE>
<TE>   "If this huge project comes in, that corridor is dead," said Ed
Connor, an attorney for the Vedanta Society of Southern California,
which runs the Ramakrishna Monastery next to Saddleback Meadows. It
donated 240 acres to the county to bolster the corridor. "You would
think the county would recognize that and say, 'We really shouldn't
be putting 300 houses there.' "</TE>
<TE>   County planners say their hands are tied. Blocking development
without reimbursing the owners would amount to an unconstitutional
taking of property by the government, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking for a balance," said Bryan Speegle, the county's
assistant director of Planning and Development Services. "If they can
propose a plan that works and is compatible with the surrounding
environment, then it may be appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Before the previous 299-house plan was approved by the county,
state and federal wildlife officials signed a letter warning that the
proposal would "severely constrain wildlife movement" and
"essentially eliminate the corridor." They stated flatly that the
proposal was "not acceptable."</TE>
<TE>   But those agencies do not have jurisdiction over the corridor: The
county does. And county planners say they are open to California
Quartet's argument that the homes can be built without destroying the
wildlife link.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be ways to align habitat corridors through the site
that meet everybody's needs," Speegle said.</TE>
<TE>   He notes that 299 houses would do far less damage to the
environment than the 705 mobile homes already approved--and which
California Quartet says it will build if its other proposal is
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists say that's a ruse. They argue that the mobile
home project isn't feasible because it would require property
improvements too expensive to turn a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the county should call their bluff," said Dan Silver,
coordinator of the Los Angeles-based Endangered Habitats League.
Silver says he believes the company is trying to get building rights
to inflate the cost of the property before it invites government
agencies and preservationists back to the negotiating table.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials, however, say they are done negotiating to sell
the property as a park. The only negotiations they intend to engage
in, they say, are with builders interested in buying the land once it
has been approved for the 299 homes.</TE>
<TE>   "The company has already been through serious negotiations to sell
the property as open space," said William Ross, an attorney for
California Quartet. "It didn't pan out."</TE>

<HD>Builder Got Break on Safety Rules</HD>
<DH>Housing: City program relaxed some code requirements, but
some inspectors say hazards existed. Top officials, developer deny
risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN and PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A showcase effort to convert downtown office buildings into loft
apartments skirted safety standards and exposed hundreds of tenants
to potential fire hazards for nearly a year, according to veteran Los
Angeles city fire and building inspectors.</LD>
<LD>   City officials exempted the Old Bank District project from some
building and fire code requirements that field inspectors said were
crucial, records and interviews show. The exemptions allowed the
$37-million development to fully open last year despite warnings by
inspectors of potential dangers.</LD>
<LD>   The hazards, the inspectors said, included stairwells that could
fill with smoke in a fire, as well as a water-supply system for pipes
and sprinklers that did not meet standards for a high-rise building.</LD>
<TE>   Developer Tom Gilmore and the city officials who approved the
240-unit project said the complaints are groundless.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore's successful conversion of old offices on the fringes of
skid row into apartments has drawn national attention, as well as
millions of dollars in city funds and federally guaranteed loans. The
project along 4th Street at Spring and Main streets is the first
under a city program to promote downtown housing by easing building
requirements.</TE>
<TE>   "If you were to look at our correction notices ... you would swear
we were criminals, when in fact, if you look at them substantively,
you will see we are in fact--and have always been since the day we
opened--some of the safest buildings in Los Angeles," Gilmore said.</TE>
<TE>   David Keim, head of code enforcement for the city Department of
Building and Safety, said Gilmore was freed from some code
restrictions, but the allowances were either minor or were balanced
by other safety measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we thought there was any potential life-safety issue, the
Fire Department and Building and Safety Department would not have
approved any modifications," Keim said.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Capt. Robert Holloway, who eventually oversaw fire code
enforcement on the project, said the safety issues were never
life-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   But a group of veteran inspectors voiced criticism of the
exemptions granted Gilmore. They have asked that their names not be
printed because they say they fear retribution from their bosses, who
gave Gilmore approval to start renting his apartments beginning in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were minor stuff that would not impact the welfare of
people there, it wouldn't be an issue with us," said one senior
building official. "But we are no longer assuring that buildings are
being constructed to the standard they are supposed to be. And this
is a good example."</TE>
<TE>   The alleged fire hazards did not result in any tragedy. But
inspectors who worked on the project said that might have been luck.
Their job, they said, is to reduce the chance of death or injury, a
responsibility that relies on a long checklist of fire and building
safety standards. They said approval of Gilmore's buildings shows how
those standards can be compromised.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the exemptions from safety standards, they said, two
inspectors left for other assignments after Gilmore complained that
they were being too strict.</TE>
<TE>   "There seems to be a pattern ... of seeking ways to provide
influential developers like Gilmore with economic advantages at the
expense of public and firefighter safety," said Mike McCosker, vice
president of the United Firefighters of Los Angeles, the union that
represents city firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints by inspectors target both agencies that share
responsibility for building safety in Los Angeles, the Fire
Department and the Building and Safety Department.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore and officials from those two agencies disounted the
significance of the code exemptions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got a lot of ... stupid stuff in these buildings in terms
of overkill on the part of Building and Safety and the Fire
Department," Gilmore said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he felt so harassed by some of the field inspectors that
he asked top fire and building officials to replace them. Inspectors
cited the city's response as an example of special treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore was especially critical of veteran fire inspector Monte
Buckner, whom the developer described as a "cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody building anything new wants this guy on their job,"
Gilmore said, adding that the inspector is "famous for spending just
insane amounts of time and energy on everybody's part to the
detriment of the project and without any fundamental improvement in
life safety."</TE>
<TE>   Buckner rejected those claims, saying they show Gilmore's "lack of
knowledge of fire-safety issues."</TE>
<TE>   "I spent numerous inspection hours out there, because there were a
lot of life-safety issues. And during the reinspections, the
corrections were not completed," Buckner said.</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Holloway also rejected Gilmore's criticism of Buckner. "I
reviewed the items [cited by Buckner], and there is not one thing
that is not code-based or is vindictive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Holloway acknowledged that Gilmore asked for Buckner's removal,
but said, "I absolutely refused." Normal work schedules determine
which inspectors worked on the project, the captain said, explaining
why Buckner did not stay on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Fire Department records show that the project went through at
least two of the five fire inspectors responsible for new
construction in Los Angeles before Gilmore's inspections were taken
over by Holloway, their supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Fire union official McCosker said Gilmore was allowed to shop for
an inspector.</TE>
<TE>   "If a developer is complaining about a fire inspector, he is ...
complaining about the cost to him of the fire code being enforced,"
McCosker said. "And if [the developer] is accommodated by Fire
Department management, then that is at the expense of the public and
the firefighters who serve them."</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore's buildings are the first approved under the city's
so-called adaptive reuse ordinance. The program, created in 1999, is
intended to help developers revive downtown by relaxing parking,
zoning and seismic-safety rules. About 40 downtown buildings, with
about 3,400 units, are being converted by various developers.</TE>
<TE>   After a building has met all code requirements, it is issued a
certificate of occupancy. A building also can be given a temporary
certificate of occupancy if it fails to meet some requirements but is
deemed safe to open by both departments.</TE>
<TE>   The first two buildings to open in Gilmore's project were granted
temporary occupancy certificates. Permanent certificates of occupancy
were issued in February, more than a year after they opened their
doors to tenants.</TE>
<TE>   The project's first building, the 70-unit San Fernando, was
occupied in September 2000 under a temporary occupancy certificate.
The temporary certificates are intended to provide a grace period for
a developer to make minor code corrections.</TE>
<TE>   Tenants of the San Fernando were still moving in nearly a year
after its temporary certificate of occupancy had expired.</TE>
<TE>   After that expiration, according to a correction notice issued in
October 2001, inspectors found problems at the eight-story structure
that included fire doors not properly sealed, trash rooms with no
smoke detectors, and no floor-level exit signs to guide tenants out
of the building in a fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Any one of those items I would have gotten prior to a [temporary
certificate of occupancy]," said one veteran building official.</TE>
<TE>   Senior building and fire officials said the potential hazards were
worse at the Hellman and Continental buildings, which encompass
almost an entire block.</TE>
<TE>   During the renovation of the 104-unit Hellman, Gilmore installed a
system for supplying water to sprinklers and fire hoses that did not
meet standards for a high-rise building.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of requiring Gilmore to replace the system, officials
classified the building as a "modified high-rise," a category they
later said does not exist. The exception was granted on the condition
that the system--which used a water pipe with a smaller diameter than
the code normally requires--would pass a performance test.</TE>
<TE>   But the final test of the lines did not take place until December,
almost a full year after the first residents moved into the Hellman.
The water lines failed the test.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had had a major fire, they may not have had the water
pressure to cover the entire building," one veteran city inspector
said.</TE>
<TE>   Both Gilmore and officials who signed off on the project deny that
the water line was ever a safety issue.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt in my mind we could have effectively fought a
fire," said Capt. Holloway.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore said the 4-inch lines did not meet the Fire Department's
testing requirements--which mandated 6-inch lines--but would have
been sufficient in a fire.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they did not seek penalties against Gilmore or
his contractor for installing the substandard piping. "They paid the
price for it," said the Building and Safety Department's Keim,
referring to the expense of later replacing the pipe.</TE>
<TE>   But Gilmore got city help to cover the expense. In December, the
Los Angeles City Council approved a $1.3-million loan to Gilmore, in
part to pay for additional fire system costs, records show.</TE>
<TE>   City records show that the total cost of the project was first
estimated at $30 million, with $3.8 million loaned to Gilmore by the
city and $23 million secured in a mortgage guaranteed by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Gilmore contributed $3.8
million in equity on the property. The final cost rose to about $37
million.</TE>
<TE>   In refurbishing the Hellman Building, Gilmore's company decided
not to cover some steel beams with fire-retardant coatings. While the
coating is required in new buildings, and was insisted upon by
inspectors before the Hellman opened, the city waived the requirement
on grounds that the structure would have a new sprinkler system.</TE>
<TE>   A group of Hellman residents last fall appealed the city's
decision to allow the exposed beams, as well as the building's
classification as a modified high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about stopping the development of downtown Los
Angeles," resident Patricia Gentry told the city Building and Safety
Commission. "This is about ... having a safe building."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Steve Grace agreed. "When a developer comes before the
city, he has the right to push [building and safety standards]. But
the city has to stand its ground."</TE>
<TE>   The Building and Safety Commission denied the residents' request
to hear from field inspectors and other department officials familiar
with the case, and in February rejected their appeals on a 5-0 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The adjacent Continental Building was cleared for occupancy in
September without passing a required safety test of the stairwell
pressurization system, records and interviews show.</TE>
<TE>   The system is supposed to blow air through stairwells during a
fire to keep them clear of smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Senior inspectors said the department did not follow the standard
practice of bringing in outside experts to test the system with
instruments to measure the air flow.</TE>
<TE>   Building and Safety Department Assistant Bureau Chief Tom Stevens
said he was able to determine that the stairwells were adequately
pressurized simply by standing in the doorways.</TE>
<TE>   "You open the door," he said, "and you can feel the air pressure."</TE>

<LD>William Shane was cleaning his garage in Irvine the day after the
Fourth of July but quite willing to set that aside and tackle the
thornier problem. We should all be so willing.</LD>
<LD>   I asked him: What does it mean when an Arab American is linked to
a possible terrorist action? And how should we react?</LD>
<LD>   Those questions are on people's minds this weekend after Hesham
Mohamed Hadayet, also of Irvine, was shot to death at LAX after he
opened fire on an Israeli airlines ticket agent and several other
people in line behind him, killing two. Although it appears to have
been an isolated act by a troubled man, it's human nature to view the
action against a backdrop of Mideast politics and the terrorist
agenda of Al Qaeda and others.</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, if a such a man can come from as sedate a setting as
Irvine, should we suspect other neighbors with a similar background
as well?</TE>
<TE>   That's what I'm asking Shane, the executive director of the county
branch of the National Conference for Community and Justice. Among
other things, the organization is trying to bridge the gap between
the Muslim and non-Muslim communities. It has been part of several
such efforts already in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple thoughts come to mind," Shane says. "One definitely
comes under the category of 'Don't overreact.' Whether we're talking
9/11 or 7/4, we've just got to keep things in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Second, it's another opportunity to engage the community in a
dialogue over some rather broad issues revolving around prejudice and
identity and unity, all those themes. We can take this as an
opportunity to say there are bigger issues here."</TE>
<TE>   Shane's Irvine home is not an ivory tower. He knows that for many
Americans, Thursday's one-man assault at LAX will be expanded into a
condemnation of Arab Americans. Hadayet, according to authorities,
was Egyptian-born and apparently had invoked the Koran in a message
left at his home before he left on his fatal mission.</TE>
<TE>   And that means ... what?</TE>
<TE>   Probably nothing, other than one man with emotional problems acted
on them in a terrible way.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's accountable?" Shane asks rhetorically. "People with
Egyptian heritage? Muslims? Males? People of Irvine? Which of his
groups are we going to target here?"</TE>
<TE>   The answer is that, barring some further disclosures, what Hadayet
did strikes a mark against his name and his name only.</TE>
<TE>   American society tends to consider Muslims or Arab Americans "as
if they're all one, they all think in one way," Shane says. "That is
something we Americans do quite readily. We think of the Muslim
community as one, [when] it's obvious it's no more one than the
African American community or Jewish or fill-in-the-blank."</TE>
<TE>   Our heads know that people, for all different reasons, react
violently every single day in America. Grievances are a dime a dozen.
Angry husbands shoot their wives. Angry drivers shoot other drivers.
Angry employees storm their offices and shoot their bosses.</TE>
<TE>   Our heads know that. In Hadayet's case, will our hearts follow?</TE>
<TE>   Will we superimpose his actions on a Muslim and Arab American
community that numbers an estimated 170,000 in Orange County and that
had nothing to do with his rampage?</TE>
<TE>   Those who knew Hadayet have their own challenge. Were there clues
he was so close to the edge? Could they have done anything before he
got to that point?</TE>
<TE>   Those are the questions that always must be asked when violence
flares out of control. They are questions about human nature, about
individuals, about violence in America.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, despite our ill-considered temptation to think
otherwise, it's not a question about being Muslim or Arab.</TE>

<HD>Cities Aim to Shift Sand to Eroded Beaches</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Coalition seeks to streamline the process of
shoring up coast in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of beach cities wants to shore up the eroded Ventura
County and Santa Barbara coastline by trucking in sand from winter
landslides, inland construction projects or harbor dredging.</LD>
<LD>   Though the concept is not new, the proposed method is.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by various regulatory agencies, Ventura County's beach
replenishment project would be the first in the nation allowed to
place material on sand-deprived beaches as soon as it becomes
available, said Christopher Webb, a coastal scientist in Long Beach
who is working on the project.</LD>
<TE>   The group passed a major hurdle a month ago when Port Hueneme city
officials signed off on the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pilot idea; no one's ever done it before," Webb said.
"The goal is to put sand back into the coastal system to augment a
loss of sand over the years. It's just a little baby step in the
right direction to solving the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Housing, road and highway development along the coast in the last
100 years has prevented sand from making its way down to the beach
naturally from rivers.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the ocean's pounding waves have eroded once-vast
beaches into thin strips of sand, threatening oceanfront homes and
diminishing recreation opportunities, said Jonathan Sharkey, a Port
Hueneme city councilman.</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County has the highest percentage of its coast armored
with sea walls and revetments of any county in California," he said.
"If this sand is available and it's the right kind, why shouldn't it
go to the beach?"</TE>
<TE>   But right now, using sand to fight beach erosion is a bureaucratic
nightmare. The permitting process for each deposit can take as long
as nine months. And because acts of nature such as floods and
landslides are unpredictable, it has been nearly impossible to take
advantage of the high-quality sand produced by them, Webb said.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the coalition--called Beach Erosion Authority for
Clean Ocean and Nourishment--wants to work out the permits ahead of
time for "opportunistic" sand replenishment on six beaches from
Goleta to Port Hueneme over the next five years. Under the group's
proposal, if sand becomes available, meets certain guidelines and is
not contaminated, it could be dumped on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   But that is precisely what one critic of the plan is worried
about.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Donovan, a resident of Oxnard Shores, one of the six areas
chosen for sand replenishment, said the beach outside his home
doesn't need more sand. There is plenty already, he said, and any
more would be close to a nuisance.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan also worries about the quality of the sand, saying he does
not believe the material would be properly tested, as proponents have
promised.</TE>
<TE>   "It would appear the sole motivation is that they need to dump
this waste somewhere," he said. "We have vastly too much sand here,
and calling it 'nourishment' is a cynical abuse of the language.
They're saying they're going to nourish something of which there is
an overabundance."</TE>
<TE>   Webb said Oxnard Shores was chosen in part because sand along the
coast travels south. Much of the sediment deposited in Oxnard,
therefore, will end up in Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   In total, no more than 1.15 million cubic yards of sand could be
dumped on the six beaches each year, Webb said, adding that natural
rivers now deliver about 2 million cubic yards of sediment to the
area.</TE>

<DH>Growth: The developers of Oxnard's RiverPark project agree
to build new schools themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rio Elementary School District Supt. Yolanda Benitez suspected she
was in for a fight when she first met with developers of the huge
RiverPark project in Oxnard last year.</LD>
<LD>   "We asked for the land and the completed schools and everything
inside," said Benitez, chief of the small Ventura County district.
"And they just said, 'OK.' "</LD>
<LD>   What is emerging from that exchange is a rare agreement between a
developer and a California school district.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of donating land or paying for one-third to one-half of
the construction, as other developers may have done, RiverPark
investors thought completed schools so enhanced their 2,800-home
project that they agreed to spend $47 million to build and equip
three campuses right away, with no guarantee of repayment.</TE>
<TE>   If that deal is finalized, the Rio district will become one of a
handful in California to get developers to build new schools
themselves instead of passing that responsibility to cash-strapped
districts, which often rent portable classrooms for years while
awaiting voter approval of state and local construction bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "School districts are looking at new alternatives," said Duwayne
Brooks, director of school facilities planning at the state
Department of Education. "And if you can get a developer to donate
schools, that's great, if they will work with you on the design. But
there are just a few instances where that has happened."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, California districts have submitted plans to build 725
schools, including about a dozen where developers agreed to pay for
the campuses up front, according to the state architect's office.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few have been built so far, including two in San
Francisco's suburban East Bay and one in Corona in Riverside County,
both fast-growing areas. Districts in Merced, San Joaquin and Yuba
counties have also approved developer-built schools. And more are on
the drawing board in areas where new subdivisions are large enough to
support big up-front expenses--in San Ramon in Contra Costa County,
near Santa Clarita in Los Angeles County and in Moreno Valley,
Camarillo and Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a very good deal for school districts and developers,"
said Bill Van Gundy, former executive officer of the state Office of
Public School Construction. "It can be a win-win situation."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not common, at least not yet.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is because not many developers have the financial
wherewithal to offer such an expensive bonus. And districts have a
legal right to demand only part of the construction cost from
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Another is because animosity between home builders and districts
grew during the last two decades as California public school
enrollments increased 50% to about 6 million students. It was not
until 1999, when a new law established stricter guidelines for
developer fees, that tensions began to ease between builders and
educators.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been almost a line drawn in the sand," Van Gundy said.
"There's a lot of acrimony over fees and sites and all kinds of
things. School districts kind of distrust developers, and some school
districts have been overzealous in their desire for fees."</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't take long for developers of the $750-million
RiverPark project--the largest home-and-business development in
Ventura County history--to see the political benefit of getting
Benitez on their side.</TE>
<TE>   The Rio district is already saddled with a 3-year-old elementary
school comprised solely of several boxy, brown portable buildings.
And the Oxnard City Council wanted to make sure the same thing did
not happen again.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark's developers realized, too, that it would be good
business to have schools ready to open when their houses first go on
sale in about 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "We told the school district we need to have the schools in place
when we bring the houses on board, and they said they didn't have the
money," said RiverPark partner David O. White.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools are home buyers' first concern," White said. "They don't
want their children bused or stuck in portables."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento lawyer Addison Covert, who specializes in school
construction and finance, said big developers have grown more
interested in building schools because the state construction process
is so cumbersome. They also think, he said, that they can build
high-quality schools far more cheaply than districts can.</TE>
<TE>   Under the traditional process, school construction money comes
from state and district bond sales--both requiring voter
approval--and developer fees. About half comes from the state, but
that well ran dry last summer and there is a waiting list of $5
billion in projects. Voters would have to approve a $13-billion bond
sale in November and a $12-billion sale in March 2004 to replenish
the supply.</TE>
<TE>   Once state money is secure, school districts must match it. But in
fast-growing districts, administrators often borrow from tomorrow to
pay for today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a very satisfactory approach to dealing with schools,"
Covert said. "Developer fees are a one-time opportunity for a
district to collect money, and then they spend [some of] it setting
up portables."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, up-front construction builds schools when they are
needed.</TE>
<TE>   There are potential pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Developers have to follow the same state siting and construction
rules as school districts. So districts and developers must take care
in choosing builders and designs and crafting cooperative agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a partnership that really requires a lot of careful analysis
by both sides," Covert said. "The school district needs to make sure
it does not get involved with a development team that's not reliable,
and the same rule applies for the developer."</TE>
<TE>   Covert, who represents the relatively poor Rio district, found the
right combination in the rich commuter haven of San Ramon in an
inland valley of the San Francisco East Bay.</TE>
<TE>   There, the school district paired with developers Shapell
Industries and Windemere, which are each building half of the 11,000
homes planned for Dougherty Valley. The builders are paying nearly
all the estimated $266 million in costs for land and construction of
four elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school, said
Joan Butt, assistant superintendent for the San Ramon Valley Unified
School District.</TE>
<TE>   The district's stylish 740-student Coyote Creek Elementary School
opened in August 2000 amid a community celebration with clowns and
food. The school cost $17 million, the party $35,000. And Shapell
paid for it all, Butt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first really successful undertaking where a developer
built a quality school in lieu of developer fees," Butt said. "If
anything, Coyote Creek is nicer than if the school district had built
it ourselves, and it cost us nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The way she figures it, Butt said, San Ramon schools are getting
about twice the value they would have gotten with straight developer
fees.</TE>
<TE>   "For this to work, you've got to have a developer big enough to
front-load the costs," she said. "This won't please the
slow-growthers, but the small-time guys just can't do it. And I'm
always cautioning other districts not to let a developer come in and
give land and portables--those only last 15 or 20 years, then you
have to replace them, and there's no money left for that."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Koch, a vice president for Shapell of Northern California,
said his company built what he believes was the state's first
developer-constructed school in Castro Valley, about 10 miles from
San Ramon, in 1995. That school was pre-built and much cheaper, and
the builder got no reimbursement from the state.</TE>
<TE>   At the San Ramon school, Shapell is eligible for $8.4 million in
reimbursement, he said. But even if that comes through one day, the
builder will have spent millions of dollars beyond the developer fees
it was obligated to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "There are benefits to having these schools [up front]," he said.
"But we built Coyote Creek four years earlier than we had to and with
a series of design elements and treatments they requested."</TE>
<TE>   In several other California districts, administrators and
developers are working together to build modular schools, as distinct
from portable classrooms. The modular buildings look the same as
traditional wood-and-mortar buildings, but they cost 15% to 25% less
than a school built in the traditional way and can have the same
50-year life.</TE>
<TE>   "We received a very typical California elementary school,"
although with modular construction, and paid for by the developer of
an 1,100-home subdivision, said Ted Rozzi, assistant superintendent
at Corona-Norco Unified School.</TE>
<TE>   "It came in at $7.4 million [about 25% less than traditional], and
they built it in six months, as opposed to the traditional year,"
Rozzi said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Ramon and Corona-Norco models are being passed around the
state by school facilities experts.</TE>
<TE>   Benitez, the Rio superintendent, was aware of both as she met with
representatives of RiverPark.</TE>
<TE>   So she asked for it all, and got it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good business for us," she said. "And it's good business for
them."</TE>

<HD>Builders Pick Up Tab for Schools</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: In an uncommon move, the developers of RiverPark
project agree to provide construction of new campuses themselves.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rio Elementary School District Supt. Yolanda Benitez suspected she
was in for a fight when she first met with developers of the huge
RiverPark project in Oxnard last year.</LD>
<LD>   "We asked for the land and the completed schools and everything
inside," said Benitez, chief of the small Ventura County district.
"And they just said, 'OK.' "</LD>
<LD>   What is emerging from that exchange is a rare agreement between a
developer and a California school district.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of donating land or paying for one-third to one-half of
the construction, as other developers may have done, RiverPark
investors thought completed schools so enhanced their 2,800-home
project that they agreed to spend $47 million to build and equip
three campuses right away, with no guarantee of repayment.</TE>
<TE>   If that deal is finalized, the Rio district will become one of a
handful in California to get developers to build new schools
themselves instead of passing that responsibility to cash-strapped
districts, which often rent portable classrooms for years while
awaiting voter approval of state and local construction bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "School districts are looking at new alternatives," said Duwayne
Brooks, director of school facilities planning at the state
Department of Education. "And if you can get a developer to donate
schools, that's great, if they will work with you on the design. But
there are just a few instances where that has happened."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1998, California districts have submitted plans to build 725
schools, including about a dozen where developers agreed to pay for
the campuses up front, according to the state architect's office.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few have been built so far, including two in San
Francisco's suburban East Bay and one in Corona in Riverside County,
both fast-growing areas. Districts in Merced, San Joaquin and Yuba
counties have also approved developer-built schools.</TE>
<TE>   And more are on the drawing board in areas where new subdivisions
are large enough to support big up-front expenses--in San Ramon in
Contra Costa County, near Santa Clarita in Los Angeles County and in
Moreno Valley, Camarillo and Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a very good deal for school districts and developers,"
said Bill Van Gundy, former executive officer of the state Office of
Public School Construction. "It can be a win-win situation."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not common, at least not yet.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is because not many developers have the financial
wherewithal to offer such an expensive bonus. And districts have a
legal right to demand only part of the construction cost from
developers.</TE>
<TE>   Another is because animosity between home builders and districts
grew during the last two decades as California public school
enrollments increased 50% to about 6 million students. It was not
until 1999, when a new law established stricter guidelines for
developer fees, that tensions began to ease between builders and
educators.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been almost a line drawn in the sand," Van Gundy said.
"There's a lot of acrimony over fees and sites and all kinds of
things. School districts kind of distrust developers, and some school
districts have been overzealous in their desire for fees."</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't take long for developers of the $750-million
RiverPark project--the largest home-and-business development in
Ventura County history--to see the political benefit of getting
Benitez on their side.</TE>
<TE>   The Rio district is already saddled with a 3-year-old elementary
school consisting solely of several boxy, brown portable buildings.
And the Oxnard City Council wanted to make sure the same thing did
not happen again.</TE>
<TE>   RiverPark's developers realized, too, that it would be good
business to have schools ready to open when their houses first go on
sale in about 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "We told the school district we need to have the schools in place
when we bring the houses on board, and they said they didn't have the
money," said RiverPark partner David O. White.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools are home buyers' first concern," White said. "They don't
want their children bused or stuck in portables. So we wanted to make
sure our development has first-class schools."</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento lawyer Addison Covert, who specializes in school
construction and finance, said big developers have grown more
interested in building schools because the state construction process
is so cumbersome. They also think, he said, that they can build
high-quality schools far more cheaply than districts can as part of a
larger construction plan.</TE>
<TE>   Under the traditional process, school construction money comes
from state and district bond sales--both requiring voter
approval--and developer fees. About half comes from the state, but
that well ran dry last summer and there is a waiting list of $5
billion in projects. Voters would have to approve a $13-billion bond
sale in November and a $12-billion sale in March 2004 to replenish
the supply.</TE>
<TE>   Once state money is secure, school districts must match it. But in
fast-growing districts, administrators often borrow from tomorrow to
pay for today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a very satisfactory approach to dealing with schools,"
Covert said. "Developer fees are a one-time opportunity for a
district to collect money, and then they spend [some of] it setting
up portables."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, up-front construction builds schools when they are
needed, rather than after the fact or not at all.</TE>
<TE>   Not that there aren't potential pitfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Developers have to follow the same state siting and construction
rules as school districts. So districts and developers must take care
in choosing builders and designs and crafting cooperative agreements.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a partnership that really requires a lot of careful analysis
by both sides," Covert said. "The school district needs to make sure
it does not get involved with a development team that's not reliable,
and the same rule applies for the developer."</TE>
<TE>   Covert, who represents the relatively poor Rio district, found the
right combination in the rich commuter haven of San Ramon in an
inland valley of the San Francisco East Bay.</TE>
<TE>   There, the school district paired with developers Shapell
Industries and Windemere, which are each building half of the 11,000
homes planned for Dougherty Valley. The builders are paying nearly
all the estimated $266 million in costs for land and construction of
four elementary schools, two middle schools and one high school, said
Joan Butt, assistant superintendent for the San Ramon Valley Unified
School District.</TE>
<TE>   The district's stylish 740-student Coyote Creek Elementary School
opened in August 2000 amid a community celebration with clowns and
food. The school cost $17 million, the party $35,000. And Shapell
paid for it all, Butt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first really successful undertaking where a developer
built a quality school in lieu of developer fees," Butt said. "If
anything, Coyote Creek is nicer than if the school district had built
it ourselves, and it cost us nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The way she figures it, Butt said, San Ramon schools are getting
about twice the value they would have gotten with straight developer
fees.</TE>
<TE>   "For this to work, you've got to have a developer big enough to
front-load the costs," she said. "This won't please the
slow-growthers, but the small-time guys just can't do it. And I'm
always cautioning other districts not to let a developer come in and
give land and portables--those only last 15 or 20 years, then you
have to replace them, and there's no money left for that."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Koch, a vice president for Shapell of Northern California,
said his company built what he believes was the state's first
developer-constructed school in Castro Valley, about 10 miles from
San Ramon, in 1995. That school was pre-built and much cheaper, and
the builder got no reimbursement from the state.</TE>
<TE>   At the San Ramon school, Shapell is eligible for $8.4 million in
reimbursement, he said. But even if that comes through one day, the
builder will have spent millions of dollars beyond the simple
developer fees it was obligated to pay.</TE>
<TE>   "There are benefits to having these schools [up front]," he said.
"But we built Coyote Creek four years earlier than we had to and with
a series of design elements and treatments they requested."</TE>
<TE>   In several other California districts, administrators and
developers are working together to build modular schools, as distinct
from portable classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The modular buildings may look the same as traditional
wood-and-mortar buildings, and they often have the usual concrete
slab foundations. But they have steel frames, instead of wood, and
pre-cut walls.</TE>
<TE>   Builders say they cost 15% to 25% less than a school built in the
traditional way and, but can have the same 50-year life. They are
inexpensive enough that some developers say they can put them up for
about the cost of the fees they would have to pay schools, if the
state comes through with some reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   "We received a very typical California elementary school,"
although with modular construction, and paid for by the developer of
an 1,100-home subdivision, said Ted Rozzi, assistant superintendent
at Corona-Norco Unified School.</TE>
<TE>   "It came in at $7.4 million [about 25% less than traditional], and
they built it in six months, as opposed to the traditional year,"
Rozzi said.</TE>
<TE>   The San Ramon and Corona-Norco models are being passed around the
state by school facilities experts.</TE>
<TE>   Benitez, the Rio superintendent, was aware of both as she met with
representatives of RiverPark, which is backed by a $12-billion
pension investment fund. So she asked for it all, and got it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good business for us," she said. "And it's good business for
them."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>When the latest experiment in downtown living was launched nearly two
years ago, brothers Chris and Peter Black were among those who wanted
to be in on the ground floor.</LD>
<LD>   "My brother and I were going to start our own studio, and this
seemed like a new frontier," recalled Chris, a 35-year-old studio
musician.</LD>
<LD>   But the two native New Yorkers are among the folks who said they
have had it with the Old Bank District project.</LD>
<TE>   First, they said, it was the broken elevators. Then, they said,
security was scaled back to almost nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ceiling was one of the worst ... that I saw," said Peter
Black, 32. "They had people re-tarring the roof [with] big rolls, and
they would drop them, and chunks of concrete would fall all over our
apartment."</TE>
<TE>   Added Peter's girlfriend, Carrie Vaiano: "We didn't have heat for
the first two months we lived there. The place was absolutely filthy.
A number of fire alarms went off."</TE>
<TE>   So in March, Peter and Carrie ended their $1,575-a-month lease on
a 900-square-foot unit at the Hellman Building at 4th and Main
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Chris and his wife also left.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel we were duped," Chris Black said days before moving out
this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Project developer Tom Gilmore dismissed the complaints as
unfounded. "Anytime somebody had a problem with their apartment, if
they went to the property management office ... somebody would go and
fix it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He also denied misrepresenting the amenities available at the
three buildings that make up the 240-unit project. "It's baloney ...
the whole thing about security," Gilmore said.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, his buildings have satisfied some tenants.</TE>
<TE>   "We plan on staying here until we can buy something downtown,"
said Elizabeth, a 31-year-old TV producer, who asked that her last
name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Living in the San Fernando Building has been such a positive
experience, she said, that she and her husband were married on its
roof by Gilmore.</TE>
<TE>   Another San Fernando resident, Chris McCoy, 36, also praised
Gilmore. "Tom has been ... good about making sure this is a
community," said the computer consultant who moved in in November
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Still, more than a handful of residents have been critical of the
project. Last fall, 70-plus tenants at the Hellman signed a petition
complaining about its safety. And in January, according to residents,
more than half a dozen tenants moved out of the 110-unit structure.</TE>
<TE>   "I am amazed at the number of people who did not renew their
leases or left before their leases were up," said Stephen Grace, who
moved into the Hellman last July and moved out in March.</TE>
<TE>   Also a former New Yorker, Grace said he owned a co-op loft in
Hell's Kitchen in the mid-1980s. "It's not as if I am naive about
living in a city and a questionable neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Grace said, he was unprepared for life at the Hellman.</TE>
<TE>   "Had it not been for the tenants pushing issues--whether it is
personal safety, fire safety, maintenance--God only knows what would
have happened here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the push has been Patricia Gentry, a child advocate with
the Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, Gentry, 47, and Grace were designated tenant
representatives. "I started making phone calls," Gentry said.</TE>
<TE>   Her first calls to the city Building and Safety Department were
exasperating, Gentry said, because its records showed that the
converted office buildings were vacant.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry, however, pressed for answers, exchanging letters and
e-mails with city bureaucrats and elected officials. The pestering
paid off, she said, after some city inspectors, and top building and
safety officials, pressed for corrections. She left the Hellman in
February.</TE>
<TE>   Gilmore said Gentry was unreasonable.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted ... me personally to listen to her complaints,"
Gilmore said. "And on a certain level, I have to say, 'I am not doing
that.' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Gentry: "If he had called and said, 'I want to meet with
you,' ... we would have been happy to. But he never did that."</TE>
<TE>   Added Grace: "I think the whole concept of what Gilmore is doing
is right on. I just don't understand how they've handled some of
these issues.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not willing to risk my safety to make a point that people
can live downtown."</TE>

<HD>Tollway Trial at a Dead End in California</HD>
<DH>Transit: Pay-as-you-go highways have become a political
nightmare. But backers say that with new approach, the roads can live
up to early hype.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Political and financial problems have led many state leaders to
conclude that California's nearly two-decade experiment with toll
roads has failed, despite fervent hopes and vast investments.</LD>
<LD>   When the state first embraced toll roads, think tanks, politicians
and government officials couldn't find enough superlatives to
describe them. Whether government-run or privately owned, toll roads
were transportation's future--an effective way to build highways when
the state had little money for new construction. So enthusiastic was
the Legislature that it helped create seven of them--five in Orange
County.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the governor says "Freeways should remain free." California
legislators speak openly of scrapping the toll-road experiment. Even
the most ardent supporters are tempering their positions.</LD>
<TE>   "I've been burned, and the public has been burned by the whole
thing," said state Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who
supported legislation that approved the 91 Express Lanes on the
Riverside Freeway and three other privately owned tollways. "We must
never allow the state's obligation to build a first-rate public
highway system to be compromised again."</TE>
<TE>   The Express Lanes created such a political nightmare that the
Orange County Transportation Authority wants to buy the project and
put it into the public's hands. Three other toll roads in the county
are struggling with lower-than-expected revenue. A fifth proposed
tollway in Orange County and another in the Bay Area have been
stalled by political opposition and financial problems.</TE>
<TE>   The only tollway project untainted by controversy is a proposed
segment of California 125 near the Mexican border in San Diego
County. It may provide the last chance to prove that a privately
owned toll road can work in California. Construction on the
$425-million highway is scheduled to begin by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Toll road advocates concede that the experiment has not gone well.
But they say tollways remain a viable alternative in a state
struggling to meet its growing transportation demands. Federal and
state gas taxes, supporters say, will not provide enough money to pay
for billions of dollars in needed highways. And the state, they note,
had to close a $23-billion budget gap this year.</TE>
<TE>   "There probably isn't much support for this idea anymore. That is
a shame," said Irvine City Councilman Mike Ward, who sits on the OCTA
board of directors. "When a mistake is made, the pendulum always
swings too far the other way."</TE>
<TE>   McClintock and other disaffected politicians should not be so hard
on the measures they helped to make law, Ward said, because they
supplied necessary freeways much faster and cheaper than the state
could.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the eastern United States, where turnpikes have been widely
accepted, California has little experience with toll roads and turned
to them only when no alternative could be found.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature began supporting them in 1986 when it created the
Transportation Corridor Agencies, a government entity based in
Irvine. Financed by $4 billion in bond sales, the TCA built a 51-mile
network of highways, including the Foothill, the Eastern and the San
Joaquin Hills toll roads slicing through the canyons and hills in
eastern and southern Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, the Legislature approved four more that would
be owned and financed by private companies--The Mid-State Tollway in
Alameda and Contra Costa counties; the segment of California 125 in
San Diego County; a proposed extension of the Orange Freeway in
Orange County and the 91 Express Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   Facing an acute shortage of transportation funds at the time,
legislators said tollways would take the pressure off snarled
freeways and accommodate future residential and commercial
development, particularly in fast-growing Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Disenchantment with the pay-as-you-go highways took root in 1995
when public opposition to the Mid-State Tollway began to grow. The
40-mile, $600-million route that was to run through the East Bay was
abandoned in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the state recently terminated the franchise
agreement for the proposed extension of the Orange Freeway, an
11-mile road that was to follow the Santa Ana River, connecting the
Santa Ana and San Diego freeways. Caltrans officials say American
Transportation Development did not begin construction on time,
leaving them no choice but to cancel the contract. The Arizona-based
company is contesting the matter in court.</TE>
<TE>   Default on Bonds Feared</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, traffic and revenue on the 16-mile San Joaquin Hills
toll road has lagged so badly behind projections that the
Transportation Corridor Agencies may default on $1 billion in bonds
by 2012.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials are considering an administrative merger of the
ailing road with the Foothill and the Eastern tollways, two routes
that--so far--are ahead of revenue projections. But there is concern
that dramatic cutbacks in commercial and residential development in
east Orange County might affect those two roads as well, putting them
in the same situation as the San Joaquin Hills. New traffic studies
have been ordered.</TE>
<TE>   Legislative opposition to toll roads began to build in 2000 when a
little-known agreement between Caltrans and the owners of the 91
Express Lanes came to light. The clause gave the owners of the
Express Lanes power to block major improvements to the Riverside
Freeway, one of the most congested routes in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The owners of the four-lane tollway, which runs for 10 miles down
the middle of the Riverside Freeway, used the so-called noncompete
clause to halt lane additions Caltrans wanted to build.</TE>
<TE>   The clause, which was negotiated by Caltrans and never subject to
legislative approval, can prevent improvements along 30 miles of the
Riverside Freeway if they take business away from the Express Lanes.
In effect, the state had turned over control of a portion of a public
highway to a private company.</TE>
<TE>   Less restrictive noncompete agreements are in place on the roads
operated by the Transportation Corridor Agencies. They require that
the TCA be compensated for any revenue loss caused by improvements to
several public highways, including stretches of the Santa Ana and San
Diego freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Noncompete agreements are necessary, toll-road operators say,
because no one would invest in the project without some assurances
the highway would survive economically. In other words, the more
congested the freeway, the more drivers will turn to toll roads.</TE>
<TE>   After years of supporting the Express Lanes, the Orange County
Transportation Authority is now trying to buy the tollway for $207.5
million. If the deal is made, OCTA wants to lift the controversial
noncompete clause and make hundreds of millions of dollars in
improvements to the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole concept of noncompete clauses has put a stranglehold on
the state's ability to make improvements to highways," said Orange
County supervisor and OCTA board chairman Todd Spitzer, who has led
the effort to buy the toll lanes. "Government should not abdicate its
responsibility to provide infrastructure."</TE>
<TE>   Future Backing Unlikely</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of noncompete clauses, members of the Assembly and
Senate Transportation Committees say it is unlikely the Legislature
will support more toll roads. State Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver
City), chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, has called
noncompete clauses "a scam."</TE>
<TE>   "The Express Lanes have been ... so controversial, I don't know
any one who would want to front one of these things right now," said
Steven Schnaidt, staff director of Murray's committee.</TE>
<TE>   In campaigning for reelection, Gov. Gray Davis has said he is
against toll roads, especially those privately owned. His opponent,
Bill Simon Jr., favors the for-profit operations.</TE>
<TE>   Even less restrictive agreements like the TCA's are in question.
McClintock said he would "strenuously object" to toll road deals that
would interfere with construction on state highways.</TE>
<TE>   Support for toll roads has eroded so much in the Capitol that OCTA
officials say they are having a hard time getting support for a bill
that would help complete the authority's purchase of the 91 Express
Lanes.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA, which wants to maintain the toll lanes for awhile, needs
state approval to charge tolls.</TE>
<TE>   Toll road advocates agree that noncompete clauses are a weakness
in the effort to build more toll roads in California.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably won't see privately owned tollways like the 91
anymore," said Robert Poole Jr., president of the Reason Foundation
and a leading proponent of private highways. "The idea is very much
alive. It is just going to be done differently."</TE>
<TE>   Poole and other toll road supporters point to the Transportation
Corridor Agencies as a better model. The TCA's more moderate
noncompete agreement requires the agency to be compensated for
improvements to nearby highways if they take away so many paying
customers that the operation can't pay its bills.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost momentum. The support is not where it was 15 years ago
when the TCA was created or 12 years ago when the private toll roads
were approved," said Walter Kreutzen, the TCA's chief executive
officer. "But when the population grows and the traffic gets bad,
toll roads will be one of the solutions."</TE>
<TE>   As the debate continues, a private venture is moving ahead with
California 125 in San Diego County. California Transportation
Ventures Inc. plans to build a four-lane, 12-mile highway from
California 905 to San Miguel Road near California 54.</TE>
<TE>   The north-south corridor across Otay Mesa will serve traffic going
to and from the U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   The tollway has no significant competition from public highways
and the road's noncompete agreement was revised so it cannot be used
to halt construction of public roads called for in the area's
regional transportation plan. The pact, however, allows the company
to collect for lost revenue if competing highways draw motorists
away.</TE>
<TE>   "With as much blood, sweat and tears as we have put into this
thing, I will be proud if we're the last remaining private toll road
in the state," said Kent Olsen, president of California
Transportation Ventures.</TE>

<HD>Driver of Tow Truck Is Killed</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: Man was helping a stranded motorist when
another vehicle drifted off the Ventura Freeway and struck him,
police say.</DH>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police on Saturday were investigating an accident on the Ventura
Freeway that took the life of a Thousand Oaks tow truck driver who
was aiding a stranded motorist.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Morris, 38, was killed instantly when the driver of a 1999
Honda Accord drifted onto the shoulder, striking him as he hooked a
stalled car to his truck.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the California Highway Patrol declined to identify
the driver but said he told officers that he was changing radio
stations when he veered from the right lane.</LD>
<TE>   The accident happened at 9:55 p.m. Friday on the southbound side
of the freeway near Moorpark Road.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, who grew up in Simi Valley, was the father of four sons,
ages 8 to 18. "Losing him was bad enough, but at least he passed away
doing what he loved. He loved towing--that was just Rich," said Larry
Andrews, manager of Roy's Towing in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   An employee for about three years, Morris was known for going out
of his way to help customers, Andrews said.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial fund is being planned.</TE>

<LD>Environmentalists have announced an 18-month program to restore
eelgrass in the waters off Anacapa Island, where sea urchins

<LD>   Drew Bohan, executive director of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper,
said the project received a $30,000 matching grant from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Eelgrass grows in beds and supports marine life such as rockfish
and kelp bass. A tremendous surge in the sea urchin population in the
1980s led to the disappearance of the eelgrass.</LD>

<HD>Buying Out Chancellor an Expensive Notion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the embattled Philip Westin is forced out of his job as chancellor
of the Ventura County Community College District over allegations of
excessive spending, the district will have to pay him more than
$300,000 to buy out his new, four-year contract.</LD>
<LD>   The provisions are laid out in an agreement approved in May that
pays Westin $203,000 a year to run the three-campus district. If the
board asked Westin to resign, his contract allows him to collect 18
months' salary, or $305,000.</LD>
<LD>   But at least one board member said it might be worth it, noting
that it is more important to ensure that a recent voter-approved bond
measure and subsequent construction plans are administered without
the swirl of controversy surrounding Westin.</LD>
<TE>   "We've passed a $356-million bond," said trustee John Tallman, a
longtime critic of Westin and the only board member who voted against
renewing his contract. "Three-hundred thousand dollars is a very
small amount compared to that.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look at it in terms of, 'Are we really set up with the
right people to do the right job on that bond?' "</TE>
<TE>   Westin, 57, could not be reached for comment. But he has said
repeatedly that he has no intention of resigning.</TE>
<TE>   District counsel Jack Lipton noted that any termination of the
chancellor's contract would have to come with Westin's consent,
unless the board could show cause.</TE>
<TE>   "The contract is very simple," Lipton said. "It's not meant to be
tricky."</TE>
<TE>   To show cause, the board would have to prove one of the following:
that Westin violated the contract; that he failed to perform his
duties competently; that he had a physical or mental disability that
prevented him from performing his job; that he habitually neglected
his duties; that he engaged in willful misconduct; or that he was
convicted of a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Art Hernandez said last week that he wants the five-member
board to reconsider Westin's contract because of public outrage
sparked by recent revelations of the chancellor's spending habits.
During a four year period, Westin was reimbursed more than $119,000
by the district for business-related expenses, according to district
records.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Norman Nagel could not be reached for comment, but
trustees Bob Gonzales, Allan Jacobs and Tallman said they would be
willing to discuss the issue at a future board meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we need to revisit the contract, but I think we
need to review all the expenditure issues and the policies we have
and see if there's more that needs to be done," Jacobs said. "I think
the chancellor has done a very good job for the district. There have
been some glitches along the way, which you are always going to have
if you're a public figure like that."</TE>
<TE>   The board voted 4 to 1 in May to extend Westin's contract and
award him a 16% raise, even though it had been informed of immense
expense reimbursements two months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   After Westin's expenditures were made public, however, taxpayer
advocates, faculty union members and the public responded by calling
for the chancellor's resignation. More than 100 people showed up at
last month's board meeting, demanding that the chancellor and
trustees step down.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said the public outcry prompted him to ask Nagel to call
a closed-session meeting to discuss Westin's future with the
district. He said he was under pressure and acted hastily when he
voted to renew the chancellor's contract.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to revisit the contract--that's what the people want,"
Hernandez said last week. "I just want to show some leadership....
I'll take responsibility for my vote."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez said it would be premature to discuss the potential
costs of buying out Westin's contract.</TE>
<TE>   Tallman said that before reviewing the chancellor's contract, the
board should hire an independent auditor to thoroughly examine
Westin's expenses. Earlier this year, the board hired an auditor
chosen from among a handful suggested by Lipton's law firm. Tallman
objected at the time, saying the auditor was not truly independent.</TE>
<TE>   "This [previous audit] cost something like $6,000, it only took
about a week and they only used one person," he said.</TE>

<HD>Nearly 40, Moyer Is Coming of Age</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Kelley of the Seattle Times, commenting on junkball Mariner
pitcher Jamie Moyer:</LD>
<LD>   "He turns 40 in November, but he's pitching as if he has found the
secret to eternal youth. He's baseball's Dick Clark....</LD>
<LD>   "Moyer is to baseball what Jason Kidd is to basketball. His
pitches are as deceptive and on-the-money as Kidd's no-look passes.
He changes speeds like Kidd in the open court, like a Formula One car
at Monte Carlo....</LD>
<TE>   "Moyer is all dirty tricks. He's G. Gordon Liddy with a glove."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Byron Nelson holds the record for PGA Tour victories
in one year with 18 in 1945. Who is the runner-up?</TE>
<TE>   Wrong man to go? Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune, writing
before Don Baylor was fired by Chicago Cub President Andy MacPhail:
"It sure would be nice to find out if MacPhail's backbone is made of
something stronger than marmalade. This is his $75-million payroll.
He hired Baylor. He knew this was a manager who could relate to
veterans. The veterans have let Baylor down."</TE>
<TE>   Seve's decline: Seve Ballesteros, 45, the former Masters and
British Open champion, has withdrawn from this year's British Open.
His game is apparently in shambles.</TE>
<TE>   Comment from Jim McCabe of the Boston Globe: " ... It's probably a
blessing that Ballesteros won't be at Muirfield in a few weeks. The
image of him making miraculous shot after miraculous shot and
charging up the fairway a proud and majestic artist is one that
should be preserved forever, not replaced by those hapless rounds
that have become far too common."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprising: Eddie Sefko of the Houston Chronicle researched
the names of golf courses in the U.S. and found that Riverside was
the most popular choice.</TE>
<TE>   "There are 23 Riverside Golf Courses available to the public. And
this doesn't even include private facilities," he wrote. "Riverside
far outdistanced Lakeside, which had 16 entries....</TE>
<TE>   "And here's a personal favorite from Florida--the Hombre, in
Panama City. It's got three nines--the Good, the Bad and the Ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Strip, but no tease: Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg in the San
Francisco Chronicle: "After watching the World Cup, one of the many
things I don't understand about soccer is ripping off your shirt
after a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "We should pray this trend does not find its way to the Senior PGA
Tour."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1985, 17-year-old Boris Becker became
the youngest champion and first unseeded player in the history of the
men's singles at Wimbledon with a 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4 victory over
Kevin Curren.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1923, Cleveland, scoring in
each of its eight at-bats, set an American League record for runs in
a 27-3 victory over Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Ben Hogan, with 13, in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jim Armstrong, writing on Alex Rodriguez in the
Denver Post: "Let's see if I got this straight. A-Rod, already making
$25 million a year, got $100,000 for making the American League
All-Star team?</TE>
<TE>   "Let me guess. He's going to be flown to the game in a private jet
and will get frequent-flier miles for his troubles."</TE>

<HD>Petitions May Be for Cottonwood ... or Not</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Cypress Petitions Seek Vote on Church," June 28:</LD>
<LD>   I live in Cypress. Over the last few days I've noticed a group of
assertive volunteers gathering signatures for two petitions outside
supermarkets. One petition is publicized as "Parks for Our Kids."
When I Iooked at the details of the petition, it appeared to me to be
directly related to the land-use issue involving the city of Cypress
and Cottonwood.</LD>
<LD>   I asked the volunteer about that and he said that the petition had
"nothing to do with Cottonwood," but that he couldn't tell me any
details. If this volunteer group is the same one identified in your
article, I would have to think they are being deceitful with the
public about their intentions. I wonder if they are afraid to state
they are gathering signatures for a petition related to the
Cottonwood issue because they fear they might get less support?</LD>
<TE>   Kimberly Magee</TE>
<TE>   Cypress</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   First let me be upfront and tell everyone that I'm a Cypress
resident, a retired police officer and a member of Cottonwood Church,
an average citizen, raising an average family, like most here in
Cypress. There have been a lot of hate letters against Cottonwood.
This comes as no surprise because there are those out there who just
don't like churches and churchgoing people, or successful ministries
that have grown large. This has been the case for over 2,000 years
and will always be the case.</TE>
<TE>   Cottonwood has been criticized for fighting for their land and for
using Nazi Germany as an example of the potentially abusive power of
the government. I've toured the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles.
One of the first things the Nazis did was take Jewish synagogues and
Christian churches through eminent domain, claiming it was for the
public good. Then they came for Jewish and Christian businesses and
homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Cypress City Council says it isn't taking people's homes--just
a vacant lot. But if you give them an inch, they'll take a mile. Just
look at how Garden Grove's City Council tried to take nearly 1,000
homes to make way for an amusement park that would generate tax
dollars. A vacant lot may be a stepping stone to your home.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Cypress is for or against Cottonwood is not the issue. The
issue is, should government decide who gets to progress and who
doesn't? Should government have the power to take privately owed land
as it pleases so it can bring in a private business it likes?</TE>
<TE>   I think we all agree that eminent domain is an allowable
government action when it comes to making freeways. But kicking out a
church for a Costco, or someone's home for an amusement park, is an
abuse of government power.</TE>

<HD>Garden Grove's Eminent Domain Plan Draws Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Hundreds Protest Zoning Proposal," June 26:</LD>
<LD>   It was a shock to see that city officials in Garden Grove have
such a low opinion of the city's residents. That is the only
conclusion I can draw from the comments attributed to the mayor and
city manager of Garden Grove. The citizens at the meeting were
correct in their lack of faith in their leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Ivan Edelman</LD>
<TE>   La Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The situation in Garden Grove, in which the City Council backed
away from using eminent domain to take several hundred homes in order
to build a revenue-producing zone, is why the majority of Cypress
residents support a retail shopping center on the land where
Cottonwood Christian Church wants to build its gymnasium, recording
studio and, I guess, a church too.</TE>
<TE>   Forgetting for a moment that Cottonwood purchased the land knowing
it was zoned for commercial use, the fact is that cities need revenue
to maintain services. All Garden Grove has is that monumental Crystal
Cathedral, which brings thousands of people to Garden Grove to pray.</TE>
<TE>   Then they get right back into their cars and go home, leaving
almost no money in Garden Grove. The church is a nonprofit. All the
entertainment put on by the church is nonprofit. Except for name
recognition, the Crystal Cathedral does nothing for the city of
Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   Now Garden Grove is forced to declare eminent domain on hundreds
of homeowners to find revenue-producing entities to maintain its
services. This is just what Cypress will be faced with if Cottonwood
is allowed to build its gymnasium/recording studio/church. And this
is why I support the Cypress City Council.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "O.C. Jail Officials Accused of Abuses," June 27:</LD>
<LD>   I must disagree with attorney Richard Herman. I have been a
Newport Beach reserve police officer for 29 years. One of my duties
is to deliver prisoners from the Newport Beach City Jail to Orange
County Jail. During this time, I have seen Orange County Jail develop
into a thoroughly modern facility, reflecting the directives of state
and federal overseers of prisons and jails, concerned about the
well-being of its inmates, and, above all, the safety of its deputies
and inmates. I have never witnessed unprofessional behavior by the
intake deputies, even when the prisoner is accused of a horrific
crime. Prisoner rights appear to be foremost in deputies' minds while
maintaining officer safety. There is an exacting medical screening of
prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   Medical safety for all concerned is tantamount, and all prisoners
are treated the same. An exacting search of the prisoners' person,
clothes and property is necessary to ensure that no contraband gets
past the intake area. Would Herman want drugs, weapons or contagious
diseases to be spread? This concern should exceed any prisoner
discomfort in having to stand for a while.</LD>
<TE>   There is no expectation of privacy in jail. This is especially so
when the safety of deputies and other prisoners is concerned. There
is no "code of silence" nor is there a "silent green wall." Jail
deputies do not make the rules. Supervisors run the jail according to
federal and state laws. Supervisors do run the jail based on Sheriff
Mike Corona's interpretation of those policies.</TE>
<TE>   If any deputy or supervisor chooses not to follow those
directives, then his or her career with the Orange County Sheriff's
Department will be short.</TE>

<LD>   What difference does $680 million make to Gov. Gray Davis, who
sees himself as lord of all California? Sitting atop his bureaucracy,
he passes down tax burdens to the California taxpayer. He squeezes
the hard-working and conscientious to fuel his unending lust for
money, money and more money. He looks on taxpayers as beasts of
burden whose sole role is to provide him with a political future.</LD>

<LD>Re "Mormons Get an OK on Newport Steeple," June 27:</LD>
<LD>   Your headline was inaccurate and an example of The Times either
playing politics or being influenced by external forces. Newport
Beach simply released the draft Environmental Impact Report on the
proposed Mormon Temple. Nobody has received any approval to do
anything. There is now a 45-day period for the public to comment on
the report; then it heads to the Planning Commission.</LD>
<LD>   This is not a religious issue, but rather an issue about building
a 124-foot lighted steeple in a residential area. Proponents know
that local homeowners oppose such a structure. We would be equally
opposed to a water tank or an illuminated gas-station sign of equal
height.</LD>
<TE>   Your headline gives those opposed to the structure the impression
that it is a done deal and that we might as well give up. They
couldn't get this past the opposition back around Christmas so now
they are trying to do it during summer vacation. The Times should
stick to reporting factual news and not try to editorialize or
influence people with inaccurate headlines.</TE>

<LD>Re "Vast Arts Complex at College Ruled Out," June 25:</LD>
<LD>   As a taxpayer in the South Orange County Community College
District, I expect some accountability from the trustees on the job
performance of employees. How could a dean spend months planning a
$463-million complex without authorization from the chancellor or the
college president? Surprising the board with a proposal to give away
35 acres of public land is not in the job description of a dean.</LD>

<HD>Legislation for Pool Retrofits Is Urged</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "1 Boy Drowns, Another Is Injured in Pool Accidents," June 27:</LD>
<LD>   Last month, two Orange County children drowned in family swimming
pools. These children, 2 and 3, were able to access the swimming
pools and fall in without being seen or heard by their caretakers.</LD>
<LD>   Drowning is the leading cause of death for Orange County children
between 1 and 5. We can avoid these recurrent family and community
tragedies by mandating four-sided fencing that isolates the pool or
spa from the rest of the property. This strategy, in addition to
greater supervision and vigilance, has been proven a
lifesaver.Lawmakers are considering state legislation (Assembly Bill
2455) to improve pool safety. However, the bill falls short because
it does not mandate the retrofit of pools with isolation fencing and
other sensible measures when properties are sold or leased.</LD>
<TE>   To use a slogan from the American Academy of Pediatrics: "Who's
for kids and who's just kidding?" In the absence of a legislative
mandate, we can only hope that property owners will voluntarily
install four-sided isolation enclosures around their pools. The
California Chapter 4, American Academy of Pediatrics Injury
Prevention Program joins others in advocating that adults protect
children by enclosing pools with four-sided isolation fencing in
accordance with Consumer Product Safety Commission guidelines.
Advocate for legislation at the state and local levels that will make
a difference. For information on child drownings and prevention,
contact the Web sites: www.aap.org and www.cpsc.gov.</TE>

<LD>Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, medics and others urged
maverick European Parliament member Marco Pannella to halt his 85-day
hunger strike in protest of the government's failure to resolve a
parliamentary wrangle, but the white-haired septuagenarian vowed to
continue.</LD>
<LD>   Pannella, founder of the civil libertarian Radical Party, is
protesting "phantom seats" in Italy's Parliament.</LD>
<LD>   In elections last year, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's party
won more seats than it had candidates, leaving 12 seats in the lower
house empty. The government says it cannot allocate these seats to
other parties as this would not be what the country voted for.</LD>

<LD>Colombia's president said U.S.-funded drug sprayings will resume in
the world's largest cocaine-producing region after being suspended
this year, the state news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The decision could spark strong reaction from thousands of farmers
in the southern state of Putumayo who earn a meager living growing
coca, which is used to make cocaine.</LD>
<LD>   President Andres Pastrana said the spraying would target large
plantations. Pastrana did not indicate when it would begin.
Fumigations have been suspended frequently in the last two years amid
opposition from farmers and pickers who say they have no other way to
earn a living.</LD>

<HD>Opposition Wishing for Ultimate End to Chavez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Jose Antonio Gil is among Venezuela's elite.</LD>
<LD>   He moves in circles of money, power and influence. He was educated
in top U.S. schools. He heads of one of the country's most
prestigious polling firms.</LD>
<LD>   And he can see only one way out of the political crisis
surrounding President Hugo Chavez.</LD>
<TE>   "He has to be killed," he said, using his finger to stab the table
in his office far above this capital's filthy streets. "He has to be
killed."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three months after Chavez was forced from office, then
returned two days later in a mass uprising of the poor, Venezuelan
society remains deeply divided. Tensions remain high, and the country
seems as polarized as before the events of April 11.</TE>
<TE>   Reconciliation efforts have completely failed. Opposition leaders
openly long for Chavez's death. One of the country's leading
historians recently wrote a front-page article whose headline read,
"It's OK to Kill a Leader Who's Not Following the Laws."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez, whose firebrand rhetoric and erratic behavior have made
him one of the most controversial leaders in the country's history,
has taken steps to moderate his tone, but they have not been enough
to appease the various sectors arrayed against him, from business
leaders to union officials to media members.</TE>
<TE>   There is no getting past the bitterness. In a week of interviews
in Venezuela, opponents used the following terms to describe Chavez:
Hitler, assassin, psychopath, terrorist, messianic, Stalinist,
communist, fascist, authoritarian, country bumpkin and several other
epithets not fit for breakfast reading.</TE>
<TE>   Security has become a top concern for the president. A populist
who once loved wading through crowds, he has almost eliminated public
appearances. Late last month,  he had ground-to-air missile batteries
installed around the presidential palace after intelligence reports
warned of a planned aerial attack. A group calling itself the United
Self-Defense Forces of Venezuela claimed to have 2,200 paramilitary
troops ready to kill Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, he has fired or demoted more than 240 military
officials who he believes were involved in the coup attempt. The
actions have deepened dissent among those in the military who already
opposed Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the economy continues to worsen. The currency, the
bolivar, has plunged almost 45% against the dollar since last year.
Unemployment and inflation both continue to rise. Venezuela is a
country holding its breath, waiting for more violence.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors of a second coup fill the country's boardrooms and
airwaves, although others dismiss such talk as wishful thinking. More
recently, a growing number of observers has come to believe that an
assassination attempt against Chavez is a near certainty.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a more divided or polarized society than
Venezuela," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the Americas division
of Human Rights Watch, who has spent more than two decades observing
Latin America's guerrilla wars and dictatorships.</TE>
<TE>   The coup began April 11 after opposition leaders held a mass march
that headed toward Miraflores, the Venezuelan version of the White
House. Each side accuses the other of opening fire on the marchers
and the counterdemonstrators supporting Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   In the melee that followed, 17 people were killed and Chavez was
forced from office. Coup leader Pedro Carmona, a businessman,
nullified the constitution and dissolved the government.</TE>
<TE>   But two days later, poor Venezuelans who form the bulk of Chavez's
support came streaming into the city center to demand his
reinstatement, as did loyal military units. Soon, the coup leaders
fled, and Chavez triumphantly returned to office.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez immediately promised to reconcile with the opposition. He
shook up his Cabinet, firing or transferring some of the most
controversial ministers to other posts. He also replaced a
controversial ally who was managing the state's oil company.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also took steps to moderate his fiery rhetoric. A former
paratrooper, he has stopped calling opponents "the squalid ones" and
has stopped wearing his military uniform during public appearances.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Chavez held out the possibility of a referendum on
his leadership as soon as next year, even though his term in office
doesn't end until 2007. His popularity soared after the coup,
increasing 10 percentage points to reach 43%.</TE>
<TE>   Top government officials said Chavez is sincerely seeking
cooperation but is faced with an intransigent opposition that has so
far refused to sit down and talk.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes two to tango," Foreign Minister Roy Chaderton said. "We
are trying to find a means to negotiation, but it's very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Chavez made clear during a recent appearance to
commemorate a historical battle, he continues to believe in his
"Bolivarian revolution," a political movement to drastically reduce
inequity in Venezuela. More than 80% of the population lives in
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   The ill-defined movement has lead to the creation of such
controversial policies as a law to allow the government to seize
unproductive land and increase state control of petroleum production.</TE>
<TE>   "The road to construct Venezuela is the Bolivarian revolution,
democratic and peaceful," Chavez told a long row of camouflaged
soldiers standing at attention before him during the ceremony. "This
is the road. There is no other."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders have responded to Chavez's overtures by
dismissing them as cosmetic. They say that he continues to interfere
with the operation of PDVSA, the state oil company and that the
Cabinet moves were simply a reshuffling, not a real change. And some
who blame him for the deaths during the coup say they can't negotiate
with a "killer."</TE>
<TE>   A congressional effort to form a truth and reconciliation
commission has stalled, further dividing the national legislature,
where members of Chavez's Fifth Republic Movement now hold a slim
majority. Outside Congress, Chavez supporters hold a hangman's noose
aloft as a warning to those who think of switching sides.</TE>
<TE>   Even outside efforts at bringing the government and opposition
together have failed. Opponents favor an inquiry by the Organization
of American States. Former President Carter and members of his
peacemaking foundation, at Venezuela's invitation, arrived Saturday
to help with mediation.</TE>
<TE>   "Venezuela's problems have a first name and a last name, and
that's Hugo Chavez," said Henry Ramos, head of the largest opposition
party, Democratic Action. "The best solution is for him to have a
heart attack. The most probable is a coup."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez opponents, at least those who don't want him dead, have
placed their hopes in two tracks.</TE>
<TE>   First, Chavez has been hit with a swarm of lawsuits and
legislative scandals in recent weeks, alleging everything from
genocide to fraud.</TE>
<TE>   At least two of those could threaten Chavez. The first is a
lawsuit accusing him of taking more than $1.5 million in secret
campaign contributions from a Spanish bank. Meanwhile, there is a
growing political scandal over the diversion of $2 billion from a
governmental "rainy day" fund to pay for state salaries and pensions.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition is also gathering signatures for a constitutional
amendment that would limit a presidential term to four years, meaning
that Chavez would be out of office next year.</TE>
<TE>   But for many, that path is too slow, and too uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything could happen," said Hidalgo Valero, an ex-colonel in the
National Guard who was arrested recently after leading a parade of
former military officers against Chavez. "There are fanatics on both
sides, and the one responsible for it is Chavez."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the heated rhetoric, some people believe in the
possibility of more tranquil times ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Protest marches since the coup have been more peaceful and
smaller, although the opposition is preparing for a massive
demonstration this month. Some groups have welcomed the government's
attempts at dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the media, which had become some of Chavez's most
heated opponents, also appear to have turned down the volume. And
some of the protesters have simply grown fatigued with the constant
battling.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is still tense, but I can see some faint signs of
hope," said Teodoro Petkoff, an analyst and editor of Tal Cual, an
influential Caracas newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Chaderton, the foreign minister, agreed, saying the climate is
less heated. He said there were "private conversations" going on with
"rational" members of the opposition to seek an accord.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult, but the only alternative is violence," Chaderton
said. "We are worried about democracy in Venezuela. It's not a
democracy under siege, but it's a democracy under attack."</TE>

<DL>ATHENS</DL>
<LD>Greek police, assisted by U.S. and British agents, raided an
apartment Saturday and found dozens of antitank rockets that they
believe were stolen from the army in the late 1980s by the elusive
November 17 terrorist group.</LD>
<LD>   Police now believe that they have seized most, if not all, of the
group's known arsenal. The organization has been linked to the
slayings of 23 people.</LD>
<LD>   Police spokesman Lefteris Ekonomou said the raid in the Athens
suburb of Pangrati uncovered large numbers of stolen antitank
rockets, hand grenades and timing devices, plus clothing and
material, such as wigs, for disguises.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second such raid against the group since Wednesday,
when weapons and documents were seized from what police said was the
group's main hide-out in downtown Athens.</TE>
<TE>   However, November 17's shadowy leaders, sought for nearly three
decades, continue to elude arrest. Police estimate that the group has
a few dozen members.</TE>
<TE>   Suspected anarchist groups reacted to the raids with two firebomb
attacks in Athens. One slightly damaged a building at a cemetery
where Commonwealth soldiers who died during World War II are buried.
The other slightly damaged an Athens bank. No injuries were reported
from either attack.</TE>

<HD>2 Held in Pakistani Woman's Rape</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MULTAN, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Police arrested two men Saturday in connection with the gang rape of
a woman who was assaulted by four men on the order of a Pakistani
tribal council. One man is a suspect in the rape, and the other is a
police official accused of failing to prevent the incident.</LD>
<LD>   Faiz Bakhsh Mastoi was the second suspect arrested in connection
with the June 22 rape. Police are searching for two other suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Bakhsh Mastoi went to the office of a local newspaper in Multan,
in Punjab province, and identified himself as one of those wanted in
the case. "I'm surrendering at the newspaper office because I'm
afraid that police may kill me," Bakhsh Mastoi told reporters.</LD>
<TE>   Police have been under pressure to capture the rapists after
Pakistan's Supreme Court accused local officers of negligence for
failing to arrest them immediately after the crime was reported.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the woman was raped by four men after a tribal council
in Meerwala village ordered that her family be punished after her
11-year-old brother was seen walking unchaperoned with a girl from a
different tribe, the Mastoi. The rape victim's age has been the
subject of dispute: Some accounts have said she is 18, while others
say 30.</TE>
<TE>   Police say the tribal verdict was illegal. But Pakistan has a
tradition of tribal justice in which crimes or affronts to dignity
are punished outside the framework of Pakistani law. The government
has given the woman a compensation check for $8,200.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Farman Ali, senior police superintendent in the city of
Muzaffargarh, said Mohammed Iqbal, an assistant sub-inspector, had
been arrested and charged with criminal negligence "for failing to
follow the procedure" in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Before the woman was raped, her brother was kidnapped by the
Mastoi tribe as punishment. A police team led by Iqbal freed him but
failed to arrest the tribesmen, who later took revenge on the boy's
sister, Ali said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's criminal negligence," Ali said.</TE>

<HD>Officers Reject Arafat's Security Pick; 3 Palestinians
Killed in Gaza</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Palestinian security chiefs rejected Yasser Arafat's choice for a new
West Bank leader for their forces, increasing pressure on the
Palestinian leader Saturday as he faces U.S. calls for reform.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, three Palestinians were killed in two separate
shootings in the Gaza Strip, including a woman and her 2-year-old
daughter who were hit while riding in a taxi near a Jewish
settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians claimed that Israeli troops were responsible for all
three deaths. The Israeli army said soldiers had fired several shots
at "suspicious figures" in the area and were checking whether they
had killed the woman and her daughter. Army officials said they were
unaware of another incident.</LD>
<TE>   Arafat has been under Israeli and American pressure to restructure
his overlapping security forces and direct them to stop terrorist
attacks against Israel. Last week, the Palestinian Authority
president dismissed three senior security leaders, including Jibril
Rajoub, head of preventive security in the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat appointed the governor of Jenin, Zuhair Manasra, to replace
Rajoub.</TE>
<TE>   But almost 200 security officers gathered Saturday to object to
the appointment of Manasra and demand that Rajoub be given another
high-ranking political or security post. Rajoub's fellow officers
said Manasra was unsuitable because he was not from Preventive
Security Services, the most powerful security branch.</TE>
<TE>   The protesters met near Ramallah and planned to march to Arafat's
battered compound, which is surrounded by Israeli forces, who control
seven of the eight main Palestinian cities and towns in the West
Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The troops turned back the marchers as they approached the
compound, but they later allowed a delegation of 10 senior officers
to enter and meet with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the protest, Rajoub said in a Palestinian radio interview
Saturday that he was not seeking another post, either in security or
politics, for the moment.</TE>
<TE>   In the Gaza shootings, Randa Hindi and her 2-year-old daughter,
Noor, were killed by machine-gun fire from an Israeli tank while
traveling in a taxi in central Gaza, according to Dr. Ahmed Rabeh, a
spokesman for Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al Balah.</TE>
<TE>   A passenger in the taxi, Jamal Ismail, 29, said the car came under
fire just after passing the Netzarim junction near a Jewish
settlement that is heavily guarded by the army.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, a 44-year-old Palestinian man, Subhi Shurab, was
killed by Israeli gunfire while walking from the southern Gaza City
of Khan Yunis to his home just outside the city, Palestinian security
officials said.</TE>

<HD>Ireland's 'Golden Circle' Accused of Tax Evasion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>DUBLIN, Ireland</DL>
<LD>Government investigators issued a long-awaited report Saturday on the
biggest tax-evasion scandal in the history of Ireland, alleging that
many of the country's business leaders secretly deposited millions in
an illegally run bank for decades.</LD>
<LD>   Scores of people lined up outside the government publications
office in central Dublin to purchase copies of the 10,000-page report
for $145 each. The inquiry has drawn huge interest in Ireland amid
allegations that a "golden circle" avoided paying millions when the
Irish faced some of the highest tax rates in Europe.</LD>
<LD>   The bank's secret clients included disgraced former Prime Minister
Charles Haughey, doctors, athletes, property developers and even a
former director of the Central Bank of Ireland.</LD>
<TE>   "The report concludes unambiguously that a variety of individuals
and corporations knowingly promoted widespread tax evasion," said
Deputy Prime Minister Mary Harney. However, she added that its
publication "demonstrates that we in Ireland now have the capacity
and the courage to lift the veil of secrecy and the determination to
enforce the law."</TE>
<TE>   The report is the product of a three-year, $3.1-million
investigation into the Irish operations of Ansbacher Ltd., a Cayman
Islands-registered bank co-founded by Haughey's late accountant, Des
Traynor. It lists 169 depositors and 10 people who conducted other
business through the illegal bank, which hid money from tax
authorities offshore and enabled Traynor's high-earning associates to
dodge crippling Irish tax rates that sometimes exceeded 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of the firm was uncovered in 1997 by a tribunal
investigating controversial payments to scandal-dogged Haughey, whose
lavish lifestyle once included spending nearly $22,000 of public
money on shirts handmade in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the depositors this year unsuccessfully sued the government
in an attempt to prevent the publication of Ansbacher names.</TE>
<TE>   The government's director of corporate enforcement, Paul Appleby,
said Saturday that the report found that Ansbacher was never legally
registered in Ireland during the approximately 20 years Traynor
oversaw its deposits and loans to Haughey and influential business
friends.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland's tax authorities vowed last month to "stick like limpets"
to the holders of Ansbacher accounts until they have exacted all tax,
interest and penalties owed to the government.</TE>

<HD>LAX Assailant Died of Abdominal Gunshot Wound</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Egyptian man who killed two people after opening fire on the
Fourth of July at the El Al Israel Airlines ticket counter at Los
Angeles International Airport died of a gunshot wound to the abdomen,
the county coroner's office said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   An autopsy Saturday on Hesham Mohamed Hadayet, 41, showed that he
died from the abdominal wound, said Medical Examiner James K. Ribe.</LD>
<LD>   Coroner's officials would not elaborate on the specific findings
of the examination, including whether Hadayet was shot multiple
times, details of the entry and exit wounds on the body or the range
at which he was shot.</LD>
<TE>   Shooting victim Yaakov Aminov, 46, died of a wound to the abdomen,
and Victoria Hen, 25, who worked behind the El Al ticket counter,
died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the coroner's
office.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the FBI continued its investigation into Hadayet's
background and what may have motivated him to open fire in a crowded
terminal building before a deadly shootout with undercover security
guards.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not linked Hadayet to any organized terrorist
groups or found that he quarreled with anyone before the shooting.
Armed with .45-caliber and 9-millimeter handguns and a 6-inch knife,
he attacked a crowd at the El Al counter inside the Tom Bradley
International Terminal before being wrestled to the ground by two El
Al security guards, one of whom shot him. At least one bystander
joined the melee.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police continued increased patrols at LAX through
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   An unattended rifle bag forced an evacuation of a section of the
Tom Bradley Terminal at 4:30 p.m. Saturday. The bag was found on the
departure level near the Thai Airways ticket counter, said airport
spokesman Tom Winfrey.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of people were led out of the building, but international
flights continued to come and go, he said. The evacuation was called
off about an hour later, when a bomb squad determined that there were
no weapons or explosives in the luggage. The bag contained a broken
bottle of liquor, Winfrey said.</TE>
<TE>   As is normal practice, no El Al flights were scheduled Friday or
Saturday from LAX in observance of the Jewish Sabbath.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to examining items seized from Hadayet's Irvine home,
officials have been pursuing interviews with family members, friends
and associates who might provide clues about his intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Hadayet, a devout Muslim, lived in a condominium with his wife,
Hala, and their two sons, ages 8 and 11, who are visiting relatives
in Cairo. He had entered the United States in 1992 on a tourist visa,
and his wife had won a green card for him through an Immigration and
Naturalization Service lottery. Records indicate that he owned a
struggling limousine company.</TE>
<TE>   Separate memorial services are expected to be held today in the
San Fernando Valley for Aminov and Hen. The service for Hen is
scheduled for 2 p.m. at Groman-Eden Mortuary in Mission Hills. The
public is invited.</TE>
<TE>   Arrangements were still being finalized late Saturday for a
private memorial service for Aminov, a father of eight, at Yad
Avraham Synagogue in North Hollywood.</TE>

<HD>John R. Luther, 83; Trade Tech Teacher Built Off-Road Rigs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Russell Luther, who built midget racers, "sand sailors" and
other inventive off-road vehicles and who taught for 22 years at Los
Angeles Trade Technical College, has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Luther died June 30 at the Kensington, an Episcopal retirement
home in Alhambra, of complications from a stroke he suffered last
year, said his daughter, Robina Riccitiello.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Adel, Iowa, Luther worked for Lockheed Vega overseeing
aircraft production for the World War II effort before joining the
Marines. After the war, he worked for such companies as Weber
Aircraft and Rocketdyne.</LD>
<TE>   He also created and built his own company, Luther Engineering, and
helped pioneer racing vehicles for youth, including quarter-midget
and half-midget cars. Modeled after state-of-the-art Indy-style race
cars, the midgets were used at special race tracks built across the
country with boys in mind.</TE>
<TE>   Luther also built sand sailors, three-wheel carts equipped with
sails, that were raced across the dry lake beds of Southern
California in the 1950s and '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Other ahead-of-their-time products he built were lightweight alloy
bicycle frames and motorized minibikes with balloon tires that could
handle rugged mountain trails and streams--precursors of off-road
vehicles to come in later decades.</TE>
<TE>   Cycle magazine tested Luther's Cobra Cycle minibike and
big-wheeled Mini-Goat in 1961. He offered both in three
versions--fully assembled, in kit form, or as a mere set of plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Minibikes are fun," concluded the enthusiastic Cycle editor Jim
Davis in his report.</TE>
<TE>   "With adequate traction, they will climb almost any hill you can
point out. They are so light that if you find yourself in a tight
spot on a trail, all you have to do is pick your bike up and walk off
with it. A pile of them will fit in the trunk of the average car.
Anyone can ride them with ease. On top of all this, they're
economical to operate.... The Cobra Cycle has a 2.5 horsepower
two-stroke engine that just screams."</TE>
<TE>   During his teaching and mentoring years at Trade Tech, Luther went
to Okinawa and helped create an education program for Americans
stationed there in the armed forces, enabling them to take courses
for academic credit at Trade Tech or USC.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to daughter Robina, Luther--a resident of Eagle Rock
for decades--is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Bina
Wallace; their other four children, Wally Luther, Laura Box,
Priscilla Heft and Rollin Luther; 11 grandchildren; and one
great-granddaughter.</TE>

<HD>Walter Mertz, 79; Discovered a Key to Insulin's Efficacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Mertz, a government nutrition researcher who was one of the
first to report that chromium is essential as a trace element needed
to make insulin work effectively, has died. He was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Mertz died of cancer June 28 at his Rockville, Md., home.</LD>
<LD>   He researched vitamins and minerals for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture for 21 years, retiring in 1993 as director of the Human
Nutrition Research Center of the Agricultural Research Service. He
conducted his early research at the National Institutes of Health and
the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.</LD>
<TE>   Mertz edited the authoritative text "Trace Elements in Human and
Animal Nutrition." He was co-author of three editions of the
government's Recommended Dietary Allowances and the National Academy
of Science publication "Diet, Nutrition and Cancer," one of the first
reports to associate diet with human cancers.</TE>
<TE>   His early chromium research was performed at NIH, where in 1957,
he and Kenneth Schwartz isolated a compound, extracted from pork
kidney, that they called glucose tolerance factor. Two years later,
chromium was identified as the active component of glucose tolerance
factor. The compound binds insulin to cell membranes and helps
regulate blood sugar metabolism.</TE>
<TE>   As an authority on human nutrition, Mertz was advisor to the World
Health Organization and chairman of the committee that issued
recommendations for trace element nutrition.</TE>
<TE>   Mertz graduated from the University of Mainz and its medical
school in his native Germany. He joined the NIH as a research fellow
in 1953 and was chief of the biological chemistry department of the
Army institute in the 1960s. He was named chief of the USDA's vitamin
and mineral nutrition laboratory in 1969. He is survived by his wife,
Marianne.</TE>

<HD>Bush Celebrates in Maine--but Texas Is Home</HD>
<DH>Birthday: Contrasting areas form the president, who turned
56 on the New England coast with his family, away from the heat of
Washington.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine</DL>
<LD>He has talked disparagingly about ''sucking salt air'' along the
coast of Maine. On Saturday, he reiterated his determination to spend
August at his ranch in Texas.</LD>
<LD>   But President Bush is by birth and upbringing as much New
Englander as Texan, and his annual visits to his parents' seaside
home bring out the dual--and sometimes conflicting--elements of his
psyche.</LD>
<LD>   ''Welcome,'' said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer as Air
Force One carried Bush to Maine on Friday, ''to the
North-of-the-Mason-Dixon-Line White House.''</LD>
<TE>   Of all the factors that contribute to public perceptions of a
president's fundamentals, perhaps none is more important than the
place he calls home. It goes to the heart of his values, familial
ties, his very foundation as an American.</TE>
<TE>   And even before his parents planted new roots just after World War
II in oil-booming Texas, their lineage was well-established in New
England--in Maine, where the Bushes had spent each summer since the
turn of the century; in Massachusetts, where the 41st president,
George Herbert Walker Bush, was born, and in Connecticut, where the
43rd president, George Walker Bush, was born 56 years ago Saturday
while his father was studying at Yale University.</TE>
<TE>   The appeal is undeniable: On any given summer day, it is likely to
be cooler in Maine than just about anywhere else in the lower 48
states, and certainly more so than in Crawford, Texas, where the
president bought a ranch in the last year of his Texas governorship.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, overnight temperatures dipped low enough to make a
blanket a bedtime comfort. It is what the president's father would
happily call ''good sleeping weather'' when he escaped from
Washington for regular visits here during his presidency.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday morning, as the sun transformed itself from a glowing
burnt umber to bright gold just above the horizon, the president was
in a long-sleeved sweater as he teed off at the century-old Cape
Arundel Golf Club.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, the high temperature was predicted to hit the low
90s, cool by standards there.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's a little warmer there,'' conceded the former President Bush
as the father-son combo began their two-hour-and-18-minute round of
speed golf. The family sport leaves little time for chatter--or
miscues--as they travel the 5,881-yard, 18-hole course.</TE>
<TE>   To see the president with his 78-year-old father is to see a man
at ease in these surroundings, which he had not visited since his
last birthday.</TE>
<TE>   The two environs--Kennebunkport and Crawford--couldn't be more
different.</TE>
<TE>   In Crawford, the two-block downtown features a secondhand store, a
barber shop, and a gas station-restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   In Kennebunkport, the shopping district includes A Source of Joy,
featuring plush rabbits, as long as they are white and wearing
costumes of pink or lavender frills; Games People Play, which sells
''fine games and puzzles;'' Shades of Summer, a sunglasses emporium,
and a store offering ''personalized'' children's books
(''grandchildren spoiled here,'' reads the window sign).</TE>
<TE>   Neither town commands much of the president's attention during his
visits: two to Kennebunkport since taking office, and 13 to the
ranch.</TE>
<TE>   And on this trip, he did not appear overly distracted by work
either. His weekly radio speech Saturday, its words lifted almost
directly from the Fourth of July speech he delivered in West
Virginia, was taped ahead of time.</TE>
<TE>   Aides said he was working on the speech he is scheduled to deliver
to Wall Street on Tuesday demanding tougher corporate accountability.
But on Friday, soon after setting down, he was out on his father's
boat, casting a fishing-pole line into the steel-gray waters off
Walkers Point, the promontory where the family compound sits.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, he set out a post-golf agenda that included a
''mechanical run,'' meaning a treadmill workout, lunch with his
family, and, for his birthday, ''maybe a surprise party.'' He was
seen tossing a ball to the family dogs.</TE>
<TE>   ''Other than that, just hanging out with my family, which is a
wonderful gift unto itself,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was certainly relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the president showed up for his birthday round of golf
in a baseball hat bearing the number 43. His father pulled out a hat
marked 41. Each designated their place in the order of presidents.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, President 43 wore a cap marked ''El Jefe.''</TE>
<TE>   ''That's French,'' he joked.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and his father call each other, in a studied formality that
actually speaks of their informality, by their titles: ''Yes, Mr.
President!'' says the younger approvingly as the elder hits his
drive. ''Mr. President,'' says the father, summoning his son to meet
an old friend encountered at the golf course.</TE>
<TE>   But notwithstanding the moist salt breeze, the vistas from the
great house on the rocks overlooking the Gulf of Maine, and the
family history here, Bush calls his 1,600-acre ranch in Central Texas
home. It offers political ties more muscular than the Texas accent
that sets him apart from his father.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, roots that run as deep as the Bush family has
planted in New England have spoken politically of wealth, privilege,
and detachment from the masses, says Bruce Buchanan, a University of
Texas political scientist. Texas roots do not.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11 and his re-creation as a wartime president, all
that may have less importance as Bush establishes a track record
outside the country's borders.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it is important in Bush's political orbit, said Buchanan,
''to be perceived as a Texan rather than as a New Englander with
roots in Kennebunkport and New Haven. Texas offers 'everyman' roots
better than Yale does.''</TE>
<TE>   There is also the braggadocio of Texas. It rankles diplomats in
Europe, who would prefer a more diffident U.S. administration,
Buchanan said. But ''Americans sometimes welcome it--it stands for
assertive leadership.''</TE>

<HD>2 Pilots Held in Airspace Violation Over N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two pilots whose low-flying jaunt through restricted airspace spurred
fears of a possible Fourth of July terrorist attack were arrested at
a New Jersey airport, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Pilots Andre Morais and Daniel Oliveria were picked up by Wall
Township police Saturday after each landed at Monmouth Executive
Airport.</LD>
<LD>   They were returning from a day of flying planes with advertising
banners attached, according to the Queens district attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   The men were being held in New Jersey on charges of reckless
endangerment filed Friday by Queens Dist. Atty. Richard Brown. The
DA's office was seeking to extradite them to New York within a few
days.</TE>
<TE>   Each man could face up to seven years in prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear whether the men had retained lawyers, the DA's
office said. A telephone message left at their company office in
Hollywood, Fla., was not immediately returned.</TE>
<TE>   Morais and Oliveria, both of Miami, flew dangerously low while
cruising their small planes past Rockaway Beach, Queens, Thursday
night, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   The planes--returning from Cape Cod, Mass., where they towed
advertising banners above holiday beachgoers--allegedly flew just 25
feet over a swimming area.</TE>
<TE>   "Their alleged aggressive and reckless actions put many lives in
danger, including their own, and showed extremely poor judgment
during a heightened state of security, especially on our nation's
birthday," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Three helicopters followed the planes along the New Jersey coast
to an airfield in Wall, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The planes are owned by Aerial Sign Corp. in Hollywood, Fla. The
company's chief executive, Jim Butler, dismissed the charges on
Friday as "grandstanding."</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities also were considering whether to file criminal
charges in the case, and the pilots may face Federal Aviation
Administration sanctions for flight violations.</TE>

<HD>Effects of Radiation on DNA Studied in Civil War Sub Tests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLESTON, S.C.</DL>
<LD>The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley may not yet have outlived its
military usefulness.</LD>
<LD>   Experts studying bioterrorism and weapons of mass destruction are
using experiments conducted with the Civil War sub, which sank with
its nine-man crew in 1864, to gauge potential effects of radiation on
DNA.</LD>
<LD>   "As with all great science, it's usually an accident that
something comes along," said Dr. Jamie Downs, Alabama's chief medical
examiner and a member of the Hunley's forensic science team. "You
don't always get exactly what you're searching for, but there are
often unintended benefits."</LD>
<TE>   After the Hunley was raised off the South Carolina coast nearly
two years ago, scientists studied whether its hull could be X-rayed
without damaging DNA of the entombed crew.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no way we could use the Hunley as a guinea pig, so real
research was needed before we could decide to use X- or gamma rays on
the sub and its contents," said Paul Mardikian, the senior
conservator on the Hunley project.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers tested remains donated to science with both kinds of
ionizing radiation and found there was no appreciable DNA
deterioration.</TE>
<TE>   Though the results offered little help to the Hunley--X-rays were
hindered by the sub's iron hull, and gamma rays had trouble
penetrating the wet sand inside--the research served another purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Downs presented it to the Mass Fatality Management Partnership, a
group of federal, state and local officials working on information
related to weapons of mass destruction, and to the American Academy
of Forensic Sciences. The partnership is coordinated through the
Army's Soldier and Biological Chemical Command.</TE>
<TE>   The experiments' results might help protect researchers handling
bodies infected with lethal anthrax. The research could also protect
health-care workers, emergency personnel and others who might come
near infected tissue, Downs said.</TE>
<TE>   The Hunley's interior remained a mystery until it was opened late
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Downs said the research answered any doubts about the
wisdom of spending time and money examining the Hunley, which went
down after sinking the Union blockade ship Houstanonic.</TE>
<TE>   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration "is the perfect
example," Downs said. "If they hadn't gone to the moon, we wouldn't
have desktop computers right now."</TE>

<HD>School Science Labs Are Often Experiments in Danger</HD>
<DH>Education: Pressured to meet higher standards, teachers are
exposing students to new perils. But state and federal agencies
keeping tabs on safety aren't watching.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GENOA, Ill.</DL>
<LD>In a flash, the routine high school chemistry experiment turned to
chaos.</LD>
<LD>   An alcohol-fueled fireball shot into the classroom, searing the
skin of three junior honor students in the front row. They took the
brunt of the blast on their faces, necks, arms, hands and legs.</LD>
<LD>   The teacher pulled burning jeans off one of the girls; scorched
skin fell from the boy's face. The rest of the class scrambled for
the door, leaving burned backpacks and books behind.</LD>
<TE>   The fire at Genoa-Kingston High School last October may have been
a horrible accident, but it was not unique. Across the country, at
least 150 students have been seriously injured in school laboratory
accidents in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   But the number is almost certainly much higher, according to
interviews with researchers, school officials and insurance
companies. And the stage is set for a significant increase, they
said. As schools try to meet tough new science education standards
set by the National Academy of Sciences in 1996, students are
spending more time in laboratories. Some are crowded. Some have
teachers with no safety training. Some are in 19th-century buildings
ill-equipped for 21st-century science.</TE>
<TE>   "Before, most kids were reading out of textbooks, but the new
federal science standards absolutely, strongly, advocate hands-on,
inquiry-based science," said Kenneth Roy, who chairs an advisory
board on science safety for the National Science Teachers Assn. "What
this means is, you have to have safety concerns as job one, but some
schools don't."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers are protected in the workplace by state safety laws, but
students are not. There is little regulation of school labs, and no
government or private agency collects data on accidents that happen
there. Thus, the exact number of accidents is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of the accidents and injuries could have been prevented
with simple measures, experts said. But many teachers are unaware of
the dangers, and there is no formal system to share information on
accidents so that teachers can learn from others' mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   But they occur often enough to be considered a serious problem,
according to safety experts and insurers who have paid millions of
dollars to settle claims.</TE>
<TE>   There is evidence that the number of accidents has risen since
schools began adopting the new teaching standards. In Iowa, there
were 674 accidents in the three school years from fall 1990 through
spring 1993, but more than 1,000 in the next three years, said Jack
Gerlovich, who teaches science safety at Drake University.</TE>
<TE>   The increase came after Iowa schools began adopting an early
version of the new National Academy of Sciences standards, he said.
The number of lawsuits soared too, from 96 to 245. Gerlovich said he
suspects the same thing is happening in other states.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this was the tip of an iceberg," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When the swoosh of fire hit Autum Burton, she was returning to her
seat in her chemistry class after taking a closer look at the colors
of the flames in the six petri dishes on the teacher's table. In an
instant, she was engulfed. "I could feel it eating at me and I could
smell my skin burning," she said. "I was on the floor trying to get
this off with my hands."</TE>
<TE>   She was burned over half her body, sustaining injuries to her
face, neck, chest, arms and legs.</TE>
<TE>   Burton, 19, now attends Columbia College in Chicago. Despite eight
skin-graft operations and three laser treatments to diminish scarring
on her face, she will be disfigured for life.</TE>
<TE>   The accident happened two years ago at Lakeview High School in
Battle Creek, Mich. Just two months earlier, a 16-year-old girl was
severely burned in a similar accident about 40 miles away, at Waverly
High School near Lansing. In both cases, the experiments involved
methyl alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   A volatile chemical that ignites easily, methyl alcohol often is
involved in the most catastrophic accidents. In recent years, it also
has caused flash fires at schools in Santa Clarita and Riverside,
Calif.; here in Genoa; Midland, Texas; New Berlin, Wis., and
Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   If the teacher does not use an exhaust system, leaves the cap off
the alcohol jug or pours too much into the dishes, fumes can build up
and, if exposed to flame, create a flash fire.</TE>
<TE>   The fire marshal in Battle Creek determined Burton's accident
could have been prevented if an exhaust system in the room had been
used to draw away fumes. And the injuries might have been minimized
if the teacher had used a plastic shield or required the students to
wear goggles.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases, school officials believed such protection was
unnecessary when students were watching, rather than participating
in, an experiment, even though most state laws require eye protection
under such circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   But Gerlovich, the Drake University researcher, has found that
more than 70% of North Carolina science teachers had never received
safety training. He said surveys in 17 other states found an average
of 55% to 65% of teachers have never been trained in safety.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of training is alarming for another reason, experts said:
Many teachers don't know how to safely store chemicals, which can
cause dangerous reactions if they accidentally mix. Some teachers
store chemicals alphabetically instead of by chemical type, or keep
them beyond their safe life span.</TE>
<TE>   In Rogersville, Tenn., last March, old, unlabeled bottles of
chemicals being removed from a school accidentally leaked and mixed,
causing an explosion and fire. No one was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In Valley, Neb., officials cleaning out a school lab last year
found a canister of picric acid, which crystallizes and becomes
highly explosive with age. When they realized it could be 30 years
old, they called the bomb squad.</TE>
<TE>   Eight months after the Genoa-Kingston flash fire, Rachel Anderson,
Eric Baenziger and Kara Butts are still recovering from their burns.
Kara and Eric wear pressure garments 24 hours a day to reduce
scarring and both will require skin grafts, said their lawyer,
Michael Alesia. The students declined to be interviewed for this
story.</TE>
<TE>   All eventually returned to school. Administrators are trying to
sort out what happened and whether they should change their chemistry
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   The Genoa-Kingston case illustrates a lack of school safety
oversight--a lack that is common in most states. Laws, if they exist,
are almost never enforced in schools. Aside from eye-protection
requirements, few laws are aimed specifically at students. School
labs rarely undergo inspections by state or federal authorities.
Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules do not
cover local or state employees, and in most states similar workplace
safety laws apply only to employees. There is no OSHA equivalent to
protect students; instead, it is assumed that if laws protect
teachers, students also will be safe, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Illinois Labor Department, for example, investigates school
accidents only if someone reports them, said Al Juskenas, the
department's manager of safety inspection and education. But schools
are only required to report accidents if someone is killed, or if
three or more employees--not students--are hospitalized with
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I think lawmakers need to take another look at things," said Roy
of the National Science Teachers Assn. "But there is a lot on the
books now that needs to be enforced, and teachers need training. You
send your kids to school because you think they're safe. It burns me
that [accidents] are happening when they're preventable."</TE>

<KH>DISPATCH FROM MOORESVILLE, N.C.</KH>
<HD>An Economic Engine Nobody Had Imagined</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOORESVILLE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Twenty years ago this fading mill town faced its own mortality. The
minimum-wage jobs stitching blue denims were disappearing fast and
when Mayor Joe Knox convened the first meeting of a new economic
development board, his opening words sounded like an obituary: "We're
getting ready to go broke."</LD>
<LD>   But a combination of shrewd planning, blind luck and convenient
geography turned Mooresville into an unlikely success story: a town
that re-created itself as "Race City, USA," home to the nation's top
stock-car teams. Now, with a facelift, identity transplant and
economic transfusion, this nowhere town has such a prominent place on
the map that it's even become a honeymoon destination.</LD>
<LD>   "The only stipulation I made when I proposed was that Mooresville
would be our first trip," said Missouri contractor Bob Kelton, a
so-called "gear head" who led his accommodating bride through the
high-tech palaces where Daytona 500 racers are built and fine-tuned.
"For race fans, this is what Graceland is to Elvis fans. It's the
Hollywood of NASCAR."</LD>
<TE>   A decade ago, top NASCAR drivers and their teams began to alight
here, drawn by favorable economics and geography. In their wake came
jobs (half the town's workers have jobs in or related to motor
sports), tourists and a construction boom that changed State Highway
150 from a country road with two gas stations into a thoroughfare of
malls, racing museums, motels and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   The problem Mooresville faced when turn-of-the-century mills
started closing is hardly unique. The Carolinas lost more than
100,000 mill jobs between 1991 and 2001. Last year alone, 62 plants
closed, taking 23,000 textile jobs as the industry--once the economic
foundation of the Carolinas--suffered through its worst year since
the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the loss of jobs, the South went hunting for
replacement industries, many of them automotive. Over the last
decade, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz went to Alabama; BMW to South
Carolina; Nissan to Tennessee. In April, Alabama won out over four
other Southern states for a $1-billion Hyundai Motor Co. plant that
will employ 1,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   But attracting new industry did not come cheap. Mercedes-Benz, for
example, got $253 million in state tax incentives to put down roots
in Vance, Ala.--$168,000 for each of the 1,500 jobs the plant
created. Mississippi got Nissan's $1-billion truck factory after
offering a $300-million package, including $80 million to train
workers.</TE>
<TE>   What is unusual in Mooresville's revival is that the effort was
spearheaded by a town, not a state, and they didn't have to buy the
jobs. And that the motor sports industry landed here by a stroke of
good luck and wasn't the type of industry townspeople wanted to
attract.</TE>
<TE>   "When the first race team moved in, then others followed, a lot of
people thought we were just getting noise; a bunch of greasy
mechanics and junkyard garages," recalled Dick Morosa, a volunteer at
the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame off a street named
Gasoline Alley. "Well, it turns out these people go to church and
their shops are cleaner than any restaurant you ever ate in."</TE>
<TE>   Knox saw the curtain coming down on the textile era in the early
1970s. He got the federal government to build a wastewater treatment
plant and the state to provide grants. The town leased 753 acres off
Highway 150 and created two industrial parks with infrastructure,
paying off the notes when plots in the parks were bought by
developers or NASCAR teams.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR's top drivers--51 of the 58 Winston Cup teams live and work
in Mooresville, or within a two-hour drive--were enticed to the town
by easy access to three interstate highways, one of South Carolina's
lowest property tax rates, plenty of land in industrial parks, and a
good lifestyle on the banks of Lake Norman, where million-dollar
mansions now are as commonplace as an order of ribs at the Sweetfire
Bar-B-Q.</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed in town with all the growth," said Jack
Moore, who has worked at the hardware store on Main Street for 56
years. "Traffic's worse, property's gone up. But we've still got a
small-town flavor and you don't hear people complain. I don't know
where we'd be without NASCAR. It saved Mooresville."</TE>
<TE>   Small-town Mooresville may still be, but with a touch of Disney.
Restaurants put stock cars on their roofs to attract customers,
streets have names like Performance Road and Speedway Drive, tour
operators shuttle tourists to the "garage mahal"--built by the late
racer Dale Earnhardt and run by his son--and the police chief is
looking for a sponsor to buy his department's 30 cruisers, to be
painted in the wild colors of stock cars.</TE>
<TE>   With NASCAR's popularity soaring, Mooresville's timing was perfect
to get a slice of the bonanza. NASCAR says its licensed clothing
sales alone total more than $100 million a year and top drivers have
become national celebrities with NBA-style incomes. Motor sports is a
$1-billion industry in North Carolina, the state says, with $750
million of it generated in and around Mooresville.</TE>
<TE>   At one new business in town, a training school for pit crews,
Chuck Homrighouse was lifting weights. A computer security analyst,
he moved to Mooresville from upstate New York and signed up for the
school's $1,700, five-week course--the first step toward a career on
the racing circuit.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured all the students would be local guys," said
Homrighouse, 36. "But look at the license plates in the parking lot.
They're from Michigan, California, Illinois--all over. Ten years ago,
I'd never heard of Mooresville. Now, if you want to do NASCAR for a
living, this is where you've got to come."</TE>

<LD>The arrest of two America West pilots last week on suspicion of
trying to fly while drunk illustrates a continuing problem that
requires a new crackdown by the Federal Aviation Administration, a
noted researcher on alcohol-related transportation accidents says.</LD>
<LD>   "What happened in Miami is a wake-up call," said Barry Sweedler,
president of the International Council on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic
Safety and former chief of safety recommendations for the National
Transportation Safety Board.</LD>
<LD>   "The FAA did take action in the early 1990s," Sweedler said. "But
they need to reinforce the steps taken, because if we don't, we'll
end up with tragedy."</LD>
<TE>   Government statistics indicate that very few professional pilots
seem to have problems with alcohol. Only nine tested positive in
random checks last year by the Federal Aviation Administration. But
if drinking problems are rare, so are many other safety issues
involving commercial aviation. Indeed, improving safety is a process
of continually focusing on rare events to make them even less likely.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA defended its drug and alcohol screening program, and
spokeswoman Laura Brown said the agency is ready to consider
suggestions on how to make it better.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always looking at ways to improve safety," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts, among them Sweedler, cannot recall an airliner crash ever
being blamed on a drunken pilot, but alcohol abuse is a recurrent
factor in a limited number of crashes of small private planes.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent involved a La Grange, Ill., physician, Edward
Marcoski, who pleaded guilty last year to operating an aircraft while
intoxicated. Federal officials said Marcoski's single-engine plane
crashed into a cornfield after he forgot to switch fuel tanks and ran
out of gas. Both he and his passenger escaped with a few scratches.</TE>
<TE>   DeKalb County prosecutor Ron Matekaitis said Marcoski's
blood-alcohol level after the crash was 0.08%, twice the level
permitted under federal aviation regulations. "Apparently, he had
been drinking before he took off," Matekaitis told the Chicago
Sun-Times.</TE>
<TE>   Federal records don't list a single commercial airliner crash that
has been linked directly to drinking, but that doesn't mean
professional pilots haven't been caught flying, or attempting to fly,
when drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, officials in Miami said they smelled alcohol on the
breaths of two America West pilots, Capt. Thomas Cloyd, 44, and First
Officer Christopher Hughes, 40, as they were carrying cups of coffee
through an airport security checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   The America West plane left the gate before authorities could
intervene, but air traffic controllers ordered the aircraft back to
the gate before it could take off on a scheduled flight to Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The two pilots were arrested after tests showed Cloyd's
blood-alcohol level was 0.091% and Hughes' was 0.084%. Both men were
later released on bond and are scheduled for arraignment within a
month.</TE>
<TE>   The airline, saying it has a "zero-level tolerance" of pilot
substance abuse, suspended Cloyd and Hughes with pay.</TE>
<TE>   Police records in Arizona show Cloyd had been arrested twice
previously in alcohol-related incidents, one involving a dispute with
his wife and the other after an argument with a neighbor. The airline
said it was unaware of the incidents before Cloyd's arrest in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Northwest Airlines Capt. Norman Lyle Prouse, his copilot,
Robert Kirchner, and their flight engineer, Joseph Balzer, were all
convicted and sentenced to prison for flying a Boeing 727 from Fargo,
N.D., to Minneapolis/St. Paul after drinking heavily at a bar the
night before.</TE>
<TE>   Prouse admitted downing more than 15 rum-and-colas, and the other
two men shared at least six pitchers of beer. Prouse fell as he
staggered out of the bar about 11:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Their plane took off at 6:30 the next morning. That was about
seven hours after they quit drinking, an hour less than the minimum
interval that the FAA allows between drinking and flying a plane.</TE>
<TE>   A man with whom they had argued at the bar notified authorities,
and all three were arrested after their plane landed safely.</TE>
<TE>   Two hours after they landed, Prouse's blood-alcohol level was
still 0.13%, Balzer's was 0.08% and Kirchner's was 0.06%. After the
Northwest Airlines incident, the FAA instituted random flight crew
tests for alcohol and drugs, checking about 10% of the country's
265,000 professional aviators every year. In addition, the agency
began checking pilots' driving records, looking for arrests for
driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Of the pilots subjected to the random checks, nine tested positive
in 2000, nine more in 2001 and nine so far this year. Most, if not
all, lost their licenses to fly.</TE>
<TE>   Arrests for driving while under the influence led to the
revocation or suspension of the pilot licenses of 230 professional
aviators in 2000 and 220 in 2001. This year's figures are not yet
available.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's 330,000 private pilots are not subject to random
tests. Arrests for driving under the influence cost 336 of them their
licenses in 2000 and 328 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Those figures seem to indicate that the problems involve only
about 0.01% of America's pilots.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 34 years of flying, I never saw a single pilot who I
suspected had been drinking or on drugs," said Barry Schiff, a
retired Trans World Airlines pilot and air safety consultant. "And I
must have flown with more than a thousand of them."</TE>
<TE>   Lew Aaronson, a retired Continental airlines pilot, agreed with
Schiff.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started flying in the Air Force in 1960, everything
revolved around the bar in the officers club, and when I started with
Continental in 1966, drinking was considered acceptable for a pilot,"
Aaronson said. "But by the '70s, all that had changed. I never got
into the cockpit with a pilot I thought was impaired."</TE>
<TE>   Sweedler said that while the problem does not appear to be all
that widespread, it's still there. "And it needs to be dealt with,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   A past problem with alcohol does not mean a would-be pilot can
never fly, but it does mean his records will be scrutinized for
evidence of recurring problems and he will be questioned thoroughly
each time his license comes up for renewal--usually once every year
or two.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA and the Air Line Pilots Assn., the union representing most
of the nation's commercial pilots, have a substance abuse
rehabilitation program that has been given high marks for
successfully returning pilots to the cockpit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very good program," Sweedler said.</TE>

<HD>More in Hospitals Will Be in Need of Smallpox Vaccine</HD>
<DH>Bioterrorism: The government believes hundreds of
thousands--not 20,000--of emergency room workers would need
inoculation in case of an attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of emergency room personnel would probably have
to be vaccinated against smallpox to adequately prepare the country
for a bioterrorist attack, a senior federal health official said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Previous estimates that only 10,000 to 20,000 "first responders"
would have to be vaccinated have turned out to be premature and
inaccurate, said Dr. Donald A. Henderson, principal scientific
advisor to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson.</LD>
<LD>   However, Henderson said in an interview there are no current plans
to vaccinate all 280 million Americans against the deadly virus,
which was eradicated worldwide in 1978 and only exists in laboratory
samples.</LD>
<TE>   Thompson is weighing an advisory committee's recommendations on a
strategy for using the smallpox vaccine, which is more dangerous to
administer than most common vaccinations. Late last month, a
15-member panel that sets vaccine policy for the nation recommended
limiting the vaccine to members of bioterrorism response teams,
estimated to number fewer than 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Requiring that all Americans be inoculated would probably result
in the deaths of 300 people because of severe reactions to the
vaccine, according to government estimates. Because of that risk, the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices also recommended against
a broad immunization campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the considered judgment of a lot of people that
[vaccinating all Americans] is not a good idea, absent a greater
threat than is now perceived," said Henderson. "What we are saying is
that we should be prepared, in case that a threat suddenly emerged,
we could move."</TE>
<TE>   However, as the government began analyzing the implications of
limited immunizations, Henderson said, it became clear that much
larger numbers of medical workers would have to be vaccinated than
the initial estimate of fewer than 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers involved here are very much larger than many people
appreciated," said Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   That view came into focus as HHS officials began consulting with
states and hospitals around the country on how the vaccinations would
be carried out. It was quickly evident that personnel in emergency
rooms receiving victims of a bioterrorist attack would also have to
be immunized.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked at length with medium and large hospitals," said
Henderson. "When you calculate three shifts a day, seven days a week,
the doctors, nurses, X-ray technicians, people who draw blood, and
attendants start adding up. You might be looking at 200 to 400 people
in the course of a week."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming that 1,000 of the 5,000 hospitals around the country were
readied to deal with the consequences of a smallpox attack, some
200,000 to 400,000 medical personnel would have to be vaccinated,
Henderson said.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be the first line of health-care workers," said
Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether hospitals could require employees to
participate. The vaccine is a live form of the smallpox virus, and
people taking it must be informed of the risks and sign a statement
indicating their consent. People who have just been immunized can
also transmit to others the particular form of the virus used in the
vaccine.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, when the vaccine was in use, the health profile of
Americans was in some ways more resistant than it is today.</TE>
<TE>   "We had very few people with immune deficiency disease," said
Henderson. "And we now have many more people who are undergoing
aggressive cancer therapy, or who have had organ transplants, which
are also significant risk factors for this vaccine." The estimates of
300 deaths in a nationwide immunization campaign rely on data from
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the government wants to stockpile enough vaccine for
every American in case there is an attack. Currently, there are some
70 million doses available and plans call for producing another 200
million by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The only known samples of the smallpox virus are under the custody
of the U.S. and Russian governments. But terrorism experts have
worried for years that samples from Russia might fall into the hands
of terrorists through the black market.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in a position where, if we needed to, one could undertake
a large scale vaccination program in a state or in an area of the
country," said Henderson. "Having said that, we would prefer not to.
It is not an innocuous procedure by any means. You could have a lot
of deaths."</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Lawyers See Motives Changing</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Advocates for victims' families say some of their
peers are driven by profit. Others say they offer protection the
government cannot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>It's a small but growing specialty practice, lawyers who go after
rogue nations for mega-million-dollar awards on behalf of victims of
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department, and some legal scholars, worry that these
lawyers are preying on the vulnerabilities of victims and their
families, innocents who already have suffered the lashes of grief and
pain. Moreover, critics argue, lawsuits against rogue countries
complicate diplomatic efforts to pressure these nations into more
civilized behavior.</LD>
<LD>   The lawyers counter that they are litigating cases no one else has
wanted--at least until recently--pursuing emotionally grueling and
financially draining lawsuits against the likes of Libya and Iran
because their clients' needs have been ignored by the U.S.
government.</LD>
<TE>   For 200 years, U.S. law prohibited Americans from suing foreign
countries. Angry at growing violence toward U.S. citizens, Congress
made an exception six years ago for victims of state-sponsored
terrorism by the countries on the State Department's terrorism
list--Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. That
opened a floodgate of litigation, mostly against Iran for its support
of Hezbollah and Hamas terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Now Congress is weighing a bill that would unlock certain frozen
assets of Iran and Iraq, ensuring a payoff for some victims--and a
boon to lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   To pioneers in the field, the trend is oddly disturbing. "I've
seen the motivations change, from the hearts of lawyers to the
pocketbooks," said Mark Zaid, who represents families suing Libya
over the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. "Now it's just another
personal injury claim. Anybody with $150 can file a lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   And they have. Since Sept. 11, lawyers around the country have
sued Afghanistan or Al Qaeda or Osama bin Laden, even though current
law limits claims to the seven countries on the terrorism list.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Newberger, who won $42 million for former hostage Terry
Anderson, disparages lawyers who bring suits against countries not on
the list, thus putting victims through more torment. "Ambulance
chasing is too good a [term] for some of these people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But others in the terrorism bar believe that suing governments not
on the list is precisely their job --pushing the legal envelope,
prodding the political system to enact change. "If you feel strongly
about a particular government, and you're worried about time limits,
shoot first and ask questions later," said Aaron J. Broder, a New
York lawyer handling some of the Sept. 11 cases, who recalls that
Libya was sued by Pan Am Flight 103 victims' families long before
Congress changed the law. "File your lawsuit, then go to Congress."</TE>
<TE>   The complexity of the law--and the urge to keep amending it in
Congress--ensures that most veterans in the terrorism bar are
Washington lawyers. "You need someone who understands the legislative
process," said Steven Perles, who once worked for Sen. Ted Stevens
(R-Alaska) and who has won some breakthrough cases in the field.
"Without those skills, it's like trying to run up Mt. Everest in your
track shoes. You're going to freeze."</TE>
<TE>   Alisa Flatow was a 20-year-old U.S. student visiting Israel in
1995. A suicide bomber detonated explosives. Her father, Stephen
Flatow, a New Jersey real estate attorney, flew to Israel and took
her off life support. The family donated her organs to Israeli
patients, and looked for a way to punish the perpetrators, the
Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Perles, a native of New England, was a familiar name in New
Jersey, having won the longshot case of a U.S. citizen imprisoned in
a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. By his own
description, Perles used a political and legal pincers tactic:
enlisting disabled war veteran and then-Senate Majority Leader Bob
Dole (R-Kan.) and suing Germany's four biggest corporations to force
Germany to pay $25 million to Hugo Princz and 200 other U.S.
survivors of Nazi camps.</TE>
<TE>   Now Flatow asked him to "do to Iran what you did to Germany."</TE>
<TE>   What Perles did was mount an emotional case against Iran that
brought the judge and several lawyers to tears. Then-Sen. Frank R.
Lautenberg (D-N.J.) sponsored a bill to make an exception in the
Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act for state-sponsored terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The bill's success was helped by an equally gripping case in
Florida. Cuba had shot down two private U.S. planes, funded by an
anti-Castro group called Brothers to the Rescue, which scoured the
Straits of Florida to help Cuban refugees find safe passage. Three
U.S. pilots were killed. The families sued, eventually winning the
largest payout so far: $97 million from frozen Cuban assets.</TE>
<TE>   The new law unleashed a backlog of grievances. Verdicts started to
pile up. The Flatows won more than $247 million. The family of Navy
diver Robert Stethem, who was beaten and murdered during the
hijacking of TWA Flight 847 in 1985, was awarded $321.4 million.
Anderson, the former Associated Press reporter who was held hostage
in Lebanon for more than six years, won $341 million.</TE>
<TE>   But collecting was difficult. The United States had no diplomatic
relations with the countries, which for the most part did not defend
themselves in court.</TE>
<TE>   Congress authorized using frozen assets to pay some specific
victims--the Flatows got $26 million, Anderson got $47 million,
Stethem soon will get $27 million--but in fact the money came largely
out of a U.S. account earmarked for Iran's military purchases. The
U.S. government put a lien on the funds and paid the award itself,
leading some to question its efficacy. Lawyers like Zaid want Libya
to hurt, not U.S. taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   Other victims were left out entirely. The current legislation
seeks to free assets for victims of Iran's terrorism who were
omitted, and Iraq's, who never were included.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is arguing instead for Congress to set up
a compensation fund to give victims of terrorism the same benefits
provided firefighters and police officers, as much as $250,000 per
family. Such a fund has kept most Sept. 11 victims from filing
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   The current approach, the State Department says, encourages "a
race to the courthouse by victims" and competition for "a scarce pool
of resources."</TE>
<TE>   And the awards are so large that they are producing lawsuits of
their own. Perles, for instance, is being sued by a former legal
assistant who says she did much of the work on his big cases and
wants one-third of his $9-million contingency fee.</TE>
<TE>   From a top-floor office overlooking the Capitol, just a block from
FBI headquarters, Stuart Newberger presides over the only
full-fledged terrorism unit at a major law firm.</TE>
<TE>   With two partners and 20 associates, Newberger has the largest
roster of terrorism clients in town--from the 11 families whose
relatives were killed by a bomb at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya in 1998
to the family of Malcolm Kerr, president of the American University
in Beirut, who was assassinated in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   The team is high-powered. Karen Hastie Williams, who clerked for
the late Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and whose father,
William Hastie, was the first African American to be named a federal
appellate judge, handles legislation. Michael Martinez, a graduate of
Boalt Hall School of Law, tracks a database of the cases on a weekly
basis. Recently, Beth Nolan, former White House counsel to President
Clinton, joined the team.</TE>
<TE>   Newberger's favorite expression is "getting in the game," and he
loves the mix of politics and prosecution that sustains the city's
legal community. A former assistant U.S. attorney in the District of
Columbia, he is an expert on the Freedom of Information Act; he won
declassification of the Kennedy-Khrushchev correspondence.</TE>
<TE>   Because his team seeks only to bring cases that have a chance of
success, Newberger said he was especially disappointed by a case
brought on behalf of U.S. diplomats held hostage by Iran for 444 days
in 1979-80. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan dismissed the case,
saying that the Algiers Accords, which ended the hostage crisis,
expressly relieved Iran of liability. Sullivan blasted the lawyers
who brought it for "repeated ethical failures," such as neglecting to
mention the Algiers Accords.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the judge is flat wrong," said Terrance Reed, one of
the diplomats' attorneys. Predicting eventual victory, perhaps with
Congress' help, Reed said, "We have a long road, and Judge Sullivan
made it longer, but you cannot ask for more worthy clients."</TE>
<TE>   Edwena Hegna has been waiting for 18 years. Her husband, Charles,
who worked for U.S. AID, was a passenger on Kuwait Airlines, going
from Yemen to his base in Pakistan, where he planned to pack and head
home for the Christmas holidays in 1984. Terrorists hijacked the
plane, then asked if anyone on board was an American. Chuck Hegna
stood up.</TE>
<TE>   They shot Hegna and threw his body on the tarmac at Mehrabad
Airport in Tehran. Two days later, as an ambulance approached, one of
the terrorists saw Hegna twitch, and shot him again--fatally.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Dupont, a lawyer in New London, Conn., was involved in the
case even before the hijacking ended. He was a family friend to
another passenger, Hegna's fellow AID worker, William Stanford. The
hijackers forced Stanford to the top of the plane's steps to plead
for their demands. Then they shot him dead. At his funeral,
Stanford's widow introduced Dupont to Edwena Hegna.</TE>
<TE>   "My whole family has been devastated by this," said Hegna, who was
42 years old with four children when the hijacking occurred. Her
oldest children were grown; her youngest son was 17. "He was the one
who came home every day to find his mother crying and wondering what
there was to live for. He was the one who admitted his mother to a
mental institution. What a price to pay, for a child to have to
endure this responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Hegna said she often has pondered why her husband volunteered that
he was American. "Maybe history might have been different if Chuck
had sat in his chair and said nothing," she said. "But my husband
wouldn't do that.... When we lived overseas we were never the 'ugly
Americans.' I keep wondering, what was Chuck's reward for being the
good American?"</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford family has dropped its case. Hegna says she will
pursue hers until she dies. Dupont was back in court recently, trying
to wrest the Hegna family's $42-million award from Iran's frozen
assets. U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy Jr. ruled that Congress
"made a grievous error" in deciding which victims get paid and which
do not.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Zaid worries that the terrorism bar's very success is
changing its character, and has stopped taking cases.</TE>
<TE>   He came to terrorism cases in law school. At Albany Law School of
Union University, he knew two of the 240 passengers killed aboard Pan
Am 103 who were coming home from a semester serving as interns in the
British Parliament. He had completed the program the semester before.</TE>
<TE>   Zaid has a seeming attraction to long-shot cases--he tried
unsuccessfully to have John Wilkes Booth's body exhumed and
represents Mohamed Al Fayed in a suit seeking U.S. documents that he
says would prove Fayed's son, Dodi, and Princess Diana were murdered
by British intelligence. And he is not the only attorney handling the
Pan Am 103 case--some families have hired the New York firm of
Kreindler &amp; Kreindler.</TE>
<TE>   But he is a believer. "There is nothing wrong with getting money,
but that's not why I pursued the case," he said. "If we, as
attorneys, don't collect a dime, it will have been worth it, just to
punish Libya."</TE>
<TE>   Anne-Marie Slaughter, a Harvard University law professor, has a
problem with what she calls "plaintiff's diplomacy."</TE>
<TE>   While faulting neither the lawyers nor their clients, she argues
that litigating victims' compensation makes bad foreign policy. The
Flatow decision, she said, came down just as Iranian President
Muhammad Khatami was trying to consolidate his pro-reform policies,
making reform a harder sell.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department argues that it needs the frozen assets to
pressure rogue regimes into correcting their histories. It warns that
other countries may someday reciprocate and attach U.S. assets.</TE>
<TE>   "Using blocked assets would preclude their use to pressure regimes
to improve their policies on terrorism," Deputy Secretary of State
Richard Armitage wrote in a recent letter to lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Kleinman, a lawyer who helped win the Brothers to the Rescue
case, agrees that litigation is hardly the best way to conduct
foreign policy. But he is outraged at the suggestion the State
Department is protecting U.S. interests.</TE>
<TE>   "For 18 years the State Department hasn't been able to use those
assets to stop terrorist states," he said. "The professors are
absolutely correct. I wish this weren't necessary. But if the State
Department is not going to protect the victims, we are."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gregory Spon was a drafting student at Pittsburgh Technical Institute
when he decided to move on to a four-year college and earn a
bachelor's degree in engineering or architecture.</LD>
<LD>   He soon got a nasty surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Spon hoped to transfer some credits, but one university after
another rejected the college-level courses taken with his vocational
training.</LD>
<TE>   After two years and $18,000 in federal student loans, attending
college meant beginning again as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I start my education?" Spon said, recalling his anxiety at
the time. "I don't have the money. I don't have the time to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Cases like Spon's are at the heart of complaints from many of the
nation's technical and vocational schools.</TE>
<TE>   They accuse four-year institutions of snobbery for rejecting their
college-level courses, particularly because both groups of schools
are eligible for federal aid under the country's patchwork system of
academic accreditation. Four-year schools say they need to be free to
decide what passes muster at their institutions.</TE>
<TE>   With roughly 3 in 5 undergraduates now attending more than one
school on their way to a bachelor's degree, according to federal
studies, transferring credits is a constant issue.</TE>
<TE>   The Career College Assn., which represents 1,050 institutions,
about half of them vocational or technical schools, says many
four-year schools are biased against them. "It's a mind-set," said
Bruce Leftwich, a lobbyist for the Washington-based group.</TE>
<TE>   Colleges, he continued, "have elitist ideas that our students
don't match up."</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based CCA argues their schools are on the same
footing as traditional colleges in the eyes of Congress when it
awards federal student aid. Any of the nation's more than 4,000
degree-granting colleges and universities--from the Ivy League to
beauty academies--is entitled to federal aid if approved by a
recognized accrediting agency.</TE>
<TE>   Regional accreditors vouch for traditional two- and four-year
institutions. National accreditors sanction professional programs,
such as nursing and law, religious schools and those teaching skills
such as culinary arts or optometry. Some schools are accredited both
regionally and nationally.</TE>
<TE>   But regionally accredited colleges often refuse credits from the
more than 600 schools with only national accreditation.</TE>
<TE>   The result, says the CCA, is a two-class system.</TE>
<TE>   "If a student is paying money and denied an education, and the
only reason they're denied is some club, then who does it hurt?"
Leftwich said. "It hurts the student."</TE>
<TE>   Leftwich stresses that his organization wants only to transfer
credits for basic college courses, such as English composition and
advanced math and sciences, not specialized vocational training.</TE>
<TE>   Still, administrators at traditional colleges assert their right
to determine which credits they are going to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody is entitled to a credential," said Barmak Nassirian of the
American Assn. of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
"Credentials are earned, and they are earned on the basis of the
autonomous decisions of the institutions who awarded them."</TE>
<TE>   Community colleges, meanwhile, stake out the middle ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We think universities, when they consider accepting credits for
transfer, shouldn't just look at accreditation status," said George
Boggs, president of the American Assn. of Community Colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Federal figures suggest that hundreds of thousands of students, at
least, enroll each year in technical and skills-training courses at
career schools and community colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one tracks how many try to transfer credits from those
courses, it appears to be a substantial minority.</TE>
<TE>   Spon, 25, finally found a school--the NewSchool of Architecture &amp;
Design in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   It accepted many of Spon's credits, so he shaved about a year off
the school's five-year program.</TE>

<HD>Death Raises Questions on Trauma Cases</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>A man here has become the first person to die from trauma injuries
since Southern Nevada's only trauma center shut its doors last week.</LD>
<LD>   Jim "Fisty" Lawson, 59, was injured in a traffic accident Thursday
near McCarran International Airport and died a little more than an
hour later at Desert Springs Hospital's emergency room.</LD>
<LD>   He previously would have been taken to University Medical Center's
top-level trauma center, but it was forced to close Wednesday after
the resignations of dozens of doctors who cited rising medical
malpractice insurance premiums.</LD>
<TE>   Las Vegas trauma patients now are transported to the closest of
the area's emergency rooms.</TE>
<TE>   As a medical examiner performed Lawson's autopsy, his two
daughters questioned whether trauma specialists could have saved his
life.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital and police officials declined to say whether they thought
Lawson's life could have been saved if the trauma center had not been
shuttered.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way anyone, a physician or anyone else, can say
whether it would've made any difference," said Mike Tymczyn, a Desert
Springs Hospital spokesman. "There's too many variables. It's so
dependent on the man's medical history [and] the severity of the
accident."</TE>
<TE>   Officials also declined to speculate whether a pedestrian who was
hit by a car early Friday and died could have been saved at the
trauma center.</TE>
<TE>   The closure left Las Vegas the only city of its size in the nation
without such a life-saving facility for critically injured victims.</TE>

<DH>Crime: Shortly before her nuptials, she shoots the suspect

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MOUNT VERNON, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Florists were hanging wisteria at Charlotte Ann Neely-White's home
for her wedding when a stranger drove up, claimed there was a bomb in
his car, and made the mistake of demanding her beloved pickup.</LD>
<LD>   Neely-White had her fiance get her pistol, and while she fought
with the man, the gun went off, wounding the man in the chest.</LD>
<LD>   A few hours later, Neely-White got married as scheduled.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a long day," the former public school principal said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "This lady was as calm as a cucumber. She can withstand anything.
I admire her guts," said flower arranger Linda Cassidy. "I don't
think I'd want to make her upset."</TE>
<TE>   Lawrence County Sheriff Doug Seneker said he had no doubt that
Neely-White acted in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the confrontation started about three hours before
Neely-White's Fourth of July wedding.</TE>
<TE>   The stranger "went rushing by and then he slammed on his brakes,
and then he came into the yard, and he said 'Somebody call 911 quick,
there's a bomb in my car,' " Cassidy said. "He was scared and
excited, and just kind of wired."</TE>
<TE>   Then he demanded that Neely-White give him her pickup.</TE>
<TE>   She refused.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever had anything you really love? Well, I love that
truck," said Neely-White, 55.</TE>
<TE>   She said the man threatened to set off the bomb if she didn't give
him her truck. "I said, 'No sir, you go ahead and set the bomb off.
My house needs work anyway.' "</TE>
<TE>   Neely-White said the man attacked her with a riding whip, so she
yelled for her fiance, who had gone inside to call police, to grab
her .22-caliber pistol.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably mowed my fiance over," Neely-White said. As a former
principal, it was in her nature to take control, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Seneker said Neely-White and the assailant struggled for the gun,
and it went off, hitting the man once in the chest. He managed to
grab the gun from her, break a window in Neely-White's pickup with a
piece of firewood and open the door. With the gun pointed at her,
Neely-White backed off.</TE>
<TE>   Police later arrested Jorge Luis Cecenas, 30, after he allegedly
abandoned the pickup. He was charged Friday, while hospitalized with
a chest wound, with first-degree assault and other counts.</TE>

<HD>State Budget Is Test for O.C. Legislators</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVEN B. FRATES</AU>
<BD>Steven B. Frates is a fellow at the Rose Institute of
State and Local Government at Claremont McKenna College.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The state budget impasse has generated substantial political heat but
very little statesmanship light. With much posturing and
pontificating, the Legislature is conjuring up a "balanced" budget.
In reality, any budget passed by the Legislature and approved by the
governor at the start of this fiscal year will be little more than a
sham.</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, the Legislature and the governor are engaged in an
elaborate ritual dance to produce a "balanced" budget. To find a
political consensus, the governor desperately will try to persuade
one or two Republican legislators to go along with the proposed
Democratic budget.</LD>
<LD>   In such a closely balanced and tense political situation, there is
a unique opportunity for innovative maneuvering. A handful of
legislators from either or both parties could wield enormous
influence. One need only recall the powerful effect of the so-called
"gang of five," moderate Democratic legislators who controlled the
budget process during the budget stalemates of the early 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Orange County taxpayers, cities, schools and special districts get
a raw deal from Sacramento. And Orange County is not alone in this
respect. Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Imperial and Los
Angeles counties get much less money per capita in state subventions
(state payments to local governments) than San Francisco County and
some other Bay Area counties.</TE>
<TE>   This presents a unique opportunity for members of the Orange
County delegation, both Democrat and Republican, to work together
with their colleagues representing the rest of Southern California to
remedy this gross inequity. The question is whether any member of the
Orange County delegation has the requisite political skill and
leadership ability.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, based on past performance, the Orange County
delegation doesn't seem up to the task. This is unfortunate, because
with just a modicum of political skill Orange County legislators
could work closely with other Southern California legislators to make
sure that Southern Californians don't bear the brunt of any bad
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader John Burton, who ably represents San
Francisco, is always keen to raise taxes. The good senator from San
Francisco is especially enthusiastic about raising taxes and fees
that smack suburban Californians with particular ferocity. Orange
County residents, to note just one example, pay more in vehicle
license fees than San Franciscans. Maybe it is time for the Orange
County delegation to look out for its constituents.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, any "balanced budget" passed this summer is going to be
balanced in name only. The governor and incumbent legislators are
justifiably uncomfortable with the prospect of facing irate voters in
November. A long, messy and inconclusive budget process is not
something that will help incumbents on election day. Hence, this
"summer budget" will be balanced by a combination of borrowings from
various restricted funds, accounting gimmicks and cleverly disguised
tax increases--all covered with a thick gloss of unrealistically
optimistic economic projections.</TE>
<TE>   The budgetary rubber will probably meet the proverbial road
shortly after election day. Only then will legislators start to be
really candid about how the state's finances are going to be
arranged.</TE>
<TE>   Given this state of affairs, the Orange County legislative
delegation actually has two opportunities to accomplish something for
its constituents. The first opportunity is right now. If the Orange
County legislative delegation were capable and competent, its members
could exercise considerable leverage during the budget deliberations.
Based on their track record, this does not seem likely to happen.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they continue their virtually unmatched record of fiscal
and political ineptitude, the Orange County legislative delegation
could get another chance to do something constructive when hard
decisions will be made in November. Their hand would be strengthened,
of course, if they push to protect their constituents during the
current negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, year after year, the cities, schools and citizens of Orange
County continue to get a raw deal from the state. And, year after
year, the Orange County legislative delegation continues to bring
home the bacon--to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   It would take many years of greater state subventions to Orange
County and reduced subventions to San Francisco County to achieve an
equitable balance of state funding for Orange County, yet Orange
County legislators do nothing about the situation.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in the interests of truth in advertising, both incumbent
Democratic and Republican legislators from Orange County could each
adopt a campaign slogan that accurately reflects their record in
Sacramento in terms of representing their constituents during the
state budget process. A short-and-sweet slogan that fully captures
their legislative record: "Pay more, get less."</TE>

<HD>Runoff Is Far Greater Threat to Coast Than Sewage Plume</HD>
<DH>The root problem at Huntington Beach is not contaminated
surf, per se, but the way California manages and regulates coastal
water quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY B. GRANT</AU>
<BD>Stanley B. Grant is a professor of environmental
engineering in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Material
Sciences at UC Irvine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most people believe that more should be done to protect our coastal
ocean and beaches, but disagreements arise over what should be done
and who should pay. A case in point is the situation at Huntington
Beach, where three years of beach postings and closures have
frustrated the public and spawned growing rancor over whether the
Orange County Sanitation District should upgrade to full secondary
treatment of sewage.</LD>
<LD>   As a scientist studying coastal pollution, and the person
frequently cited as suggesting a link between the sewage plume and
surf pollution at Huntington Beach, I think that the debate over
secondary treatment is probably, well, secondary.</LD>
<LD>   Full secondary treatment would reduce the levels of organic
contaminants, viruses and bacteria, released to the ocean. But so far
there is no evidence that the extra treatment, at a cost of $400
million, would make Huntington Beach's water quality problems go
away. What's more, sewage treated to full secondary standards still
harbors enough viruses and bacteria to pose a significant health risk
to recreational bathers if the plume comes ashore.</LD>
<TE>   So what's the solution? The sanitation district's plan to
partially disinfect their sewage is a good start, particularly if it
can be done in a way that won't harm the environment. Unlike
secondary treatment, disinfection targets the contaminants of
greatest concern (protozoa, bacteria and viruses) and does it at a
fraction of the cost of secondary treatment. It's also a great
experiment: If the surf at Huntington Beach doesn't clean up after
the start of disinfection, then the sewage plume can't be the main
culprit.</TE>
<TE>   But the truth is that street runoff is a far greater threat to
coastal water quality than the sewage plume. During dry weather,
runoff is generated by over-irrigation of lawns, car washing and
other activities that send excess water into storm drains. From there
the runoff picks up bacteria, viruses and other pollutants as it
flows to the coast, where it enters the ocean at the surf line.</TE>
<TE>   Recent efforts to divert runoff to the sanitary sewer system are a
wise expenditure of public and private funds that appears to be
improving surf water quality.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent epidemiological study in Santa Monica Bay,
the runoff diversions may also reduce the number of people who get
sick after recreating in the ocean. Expanding the runoff diversions
to include wintertime dry-weather periods (most diversions operate
from June through September) and finding ways to waste less water (by
using next-generation irrigation systems, for example) would also
help.</TE>
<TE>   However, the real challenge will be to find ways of treating the
torrents of runoff, in some cases generated by inland communities
dozens of miles from the beach, that flow into the ocean during
storms.</TE>
<TE>   The root problem at Huntington Beach is not contaminated surf, per
se, but the way California manages and regulates coastal water
quality. Because different sources of pollution are, in effect, owned
by different agencies, there is a tendency for these agencies to
focus on blame shifting rather than identifying and fixing sources of
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   The situation would improve if, as recommended several years ago
by a USC/Sea Grant blue-ribbon panel, water-quality investigations
were carried out by a neutral third party. This third party would
impartially investigate all potential sources of contamination, and
prioritize water-quality projects based on their likely benefits and
cost. Finding funding for this new agency might be difficult,
although the money currently contemplated for secondary treatment
would make a great down payment.</TE>
<TE>   The situation at Huntington Beach exposed weaknesses not only in
the way we manage and regulate coastal pollution, but also in the way
we study it. Coastal pollution is a maddeningly trans-disciplinary
problem, equal parts microbiology, ecology, physical oceanography,
environmental engineering and political science.</TE>
<TE>   For scientists, the biggest challenge is overcoming the
disciplinary arrogance that typifies our enterprise, to find creative
new ways of identifying, mitigating and managing sources of
pollution. In the process, we are creating a whole new research
field, call it coastal water quality science, that will be a critical
player in the years to come.</TE>

<HD>Iverson Investigated by Police for Alleged Threat</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson is being investigated by police after two men accused
him of threatening them at an apartment complex in Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   The Philadelphia 76er star and another man, who was not
identified, allegedly used "assaultive behavior" at the Cobbs Creek
Court apartments early Wednesday, Police Capt. Stephen Glenn said.</LD>
<LD>   That type of behavior can include "physical contact or the fear of
physical contact," he said without elaborating.</LD>
<TE>   No charges have been filed and police have not spoken with
Iverson, who they believed was out of town.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the investigation came after the Philadelphia
Daily News published a story about the case Saturday. Citing
unidentified sources, it reported that the two men said Iverson,
armed with a gun, and another man went to the apartment looking for
Iverson's wife and cousin.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson and Tawanna Turner were married Aug. 3 and have two
children.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn said the men who filed the complaint did not contend they
were physically assaulted. He declined to release a copy of the
complaint, identify the complainants or specify their relationship,
if any, with Iverson.</TE>
<TE>   Only the two men who filed the complaint were at the apartment,
Glenn said. Police, responding to a call, did not find Iverson or any
intruders when they arrived at the apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they do not expect to make a decision about possible
charges for several days.</TE>
<TE>   A telephone message left at Iverson's lawyer's office on Saturday
was not immediately returned. The 76ers had no immediate comment.</TE>

<TE>   Slammed, a promising 2-year-old thoroughbred, died early Saturday
in a barn mishap at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Grand Slam was found dead in the shedrow of trainer Al
Stall Jr. by a night watchman, track officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Stall said Slammed appeared to have suffered a broken neck when
the colt burst through the webbing of his stall and hit the barn wall
with his head.</TE>
<TE>   Owner B. Wayne Hughes bought Slammed for $250,000 at last year's
Keeneland July sale.</TE>

<TE>   According to police, Arroyo got into an argument at the Raxx Pool
Hall in West Hempstead, N.Y., and hit three men with a wooden pool
cue June 9.</TE>
<TE>   One man was knocked unconscious. He was transported to Winthrop
University Hospital for treatment of head injuries.</TE>

<LD>The Avengers will need another week to secure a home game in the
Arena Football League playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, Los Angeles lost to Arizona, 52-46, in overtime when
Rattler quarterback Sherdrick Bonner scrambled five yards for a
touchdown before 13,120 at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Avengers trailed, 46-38, but rallied to tie the score at the
end of regulation. Quarterback Tony Graziani took the snap with two
seconds remaining and found Greg Hopkins for a two-yard touchdown
pass. He then threw a two-point conversion to Russell Shaw to force
overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles had the first possession but failed to score, setting
up Bonner's heroics.</TE>
<TE>   The loss dropped Los Angeles (7-5) into a third-place tie with
Dallas in the West Division.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona (9-3) trailed, 17-16, at the half, but scored three times
in the third quarter to take a 36-24 lead. Los Angeles fought back
but needed to recover a Rattler fumble on the Los Angeles 23-yard
line to set up the final drive that tied the score and forced
overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona took a 9-0 lead in the second quarter as the Avenger
offense sputtered. But Graziani smoothed things out with a 12-yard
touchdown pass to J.J. Washington. Later, Chad Dukes rumbled in from
two yards out to put Los Angeles ahead, 14-9.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Cruises Past Tigers to All-Star Break</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pedro Martinez is headed in the right direction again--back to his
Dominican Republic home for a rest after winning his fourth
consecutive start.</LD>
<LD>   Healthy at midseason for the first time in four years, Martinez
gave up one hit and struck out eight in five innings, and the Boston
Red Sox beat the Detroit Tigers, 8-0, Saturday at Fenway Park in
Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez planned to fly south to relax during the All-Star break.</LD>
<TE>   "It's great the way I am going home now and sit down, relax and
swim a little bit," he said with a smile. "Just be at my house and
chill, play with my flowers."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (11-2) was selected by New York Yankee Manager Joe Torre
for the All-Star game Tuesday at Milwaukee, but declined so he could
rest and take care of personal matters. He'll have more than a week
before his next scheduled start July 14 at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time Cy Young Award winner continues to dominate. In his
last four starts, he has given up four runs, 23 hits and four walks,
and struck out 42 in 28 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Discounting his first start of the season, when he gave up seven
earned runs in three innings, his earned-run average is 2.24, which
would lead the American League.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez was helped by a five-run first inning against Mike Maroth
(1-3) that was highlighted by Doug Mirabelli's three-run homer.
Maroth took Jeff Weaver's spot after Weaver was traded to the Yankees
early Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 4, Oakland 3--Michael Tucker hit a home run that
turned into a single because of a baserunning mistake, but he still
drove in the winning run at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Randa singled to left to lead off the 10th against Billy Koch
(5-1). One out later, Tucker's hit sailed over the fence in center
field, but he passed pinch-runner Mike Caruso between first base and
second base. Caruso thought the ball was caught by center fielder
Terrence Long, who made a leaping stab at the hit, and turned back
toward first. Tucker was credited with a run-scoring single and was
out on the way to second.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 8, New York 3--Steve Parris earned his first victory of
the season and the Blue Jays ended their six-game losing streak.
Parris (1-2), making his fifth start since returning from shoulder
surgery, held the host Yankees to four hits over the first seven
innings--two singles each by Nick Johnson and Robin Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 7, Cleveland 3--Jeff Liefer, starting in place of
struggling Frank Thomas, hit a three-run homer at Chicago and Mark
Buehrle got his 12th victory.</TE>
<TE>   After Magglio Ordonez walked and Paul Konerko was hit by a pitch,
Liefer hit his second homer to end a 2-2 tie in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 7, Texas 5--Melvin Mora hit a tiebreaking, two-run
triple in the ninth inning at Arlington, Texas, to end the Rangers'
four-game winning streak.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Kyle Lohse pitched six scoreless innings and the Minnesota Twins got
home runs from David Ortiz, Matthew LeCroy and Torii Hunter to beat
the Seattle Mariners, 7-2, Saturday night at Safeco Field.</LD>
<LD>   Ortiz's homer in the second ended Seattle starter Jamie Moyer's
scoreless innings string at 24 1/3 innings, 10 shy of the team record
set by Mark Langston in 1988.</LD>
<LD>   In a matchup of division leaders, both benches and bullpens
emptied onto the field at the start of the fourth when Moyer (8-4)
hit Ortiz in the backside with a pitch. It was apparent retaliation
after the Mariners' Bret Boone was hit by a pitch by Lohse above the
left elbow in the third.</LD>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4, 230-pound Ortiz walked toward the 6-foot, 175-pound
Moyer but was held back by Mariner catcher Ben Davis. Lohse came out
of the dugout and tried to get to Moyer but was held back by teammate
Denny Hocking.</TE>
<TE>   No punches were thrown and no players were ejected.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz gave the Twins a 2-0 lead in the second with his fifth homer
of the season, a towering shot to right, after a single by Corey
Koskie.</TE>
<TE>   LeCroy made it 4-0 in the fifth with Minnesota's second two-run
homer. Hunter was aboard with a single.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter's second homer in two nights and fourth in 14 games off
Moyer in the seventh gave the Twins a 5-0 lead. Hunter's team-leading
20th homer of the season landed in the second deck in left.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle left 16 men on base.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer gave up five runs and 12 hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't walk a batter but had a wild pitch and hit a batter. He
struck out nine.</TE>

<HD>Eckstein Gets Things Started</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Eckstein's shining moment Friday was certainly the 10th-inning
infield single that drove in the winning run in a 6-5 victory over
Tampa Bay. But the at-bats that were more significant in the big
picture came earlier in the game, when Eckstein was the catalyst who
got the offense in gear.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein, the Angels' leadoff batter, has had some clutch moments
producing runs, including three grand slams this season. But his main
job is to get a rally started.</LD>
<LD>   "I know I need to score more runs," said Eckstein, who was tied
for second on the team with 54 runs after Friday's game. "For a week
and a half, I haven't felt like I've been doing my job."</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein was struggling at the plate and the offense was suffering
because of it. He was one for 14 before Friday's game. He had reached
base only three times in the previous four games.</TE>
<TE>   But in the fifth inning Friday, he was hit by a pitch--increasing
his American League lead to 12--and then scored on Tim Salmon's
single.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Eckstein fought off a two-strike pitch for a
single to right, which began a three-run inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Being hit by that pitch felt good," Eckstein said. "Sure it hurt
and there is still a bruise. But it got me on base and we scored.
Then I got that hit and started a big inning. That's my main job,
getting things started."</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein did just that Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He walked to lead off the first inning and stole second base--his
14th stolen base this season. He scored on Salmon's home run.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Scot Shields picked up his first major league victory
Friday, pitching the 10th inning, then benefiting from Eckstein's
bases-loaded single.</TE>
<TE>   Shields allowed only a two-out double, then waited in the dugout
while the Angels rallied.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even think about it when I went in to pitch," Shields
said. "I was focusing on what I had to do. When the inning was over,
I got to the dugout and started thinking about it. When we loaded the
bases, I got pretty excited."</TE>
<TE>   He was awarded the game ball, then had a brief celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "I called my family, then went to bed," Shields said.</TE>

<HD>No Decision but Satisfaction for Lackey</HD>
<DH>Angels: Rookie goes seven strong innings, then watches
teammates rally in eighth to beat Tampa Bay, 4-3.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are still a few things the Angels' John Lackey can learn about
being a major league starting pitcher. Little things.</LD>
<LD>   Such as, on the day you are pitching you don't have to shag balls
in the outfield during batting practice, which Lackey did before
Saturday's game at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   And, on the day you are pitching, sometimes you don't get the
victory no matter how well you throw, which is what happened to
Lackey.</LD>
<TE>   Still, there was nothing more satisfying for Lackey than watching
the Angels rally for a 4-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in
front of 29,513.</TE>
<TE>   He did the lion's share of work, giving up two runs in seven
innings. Scott Schoeneweis, replaced by Lackey in the rotation,
worked one inning and became the pitcher of record when Darin
Erstad's broken-bat single broke a 2-2 tie in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis got the victory. Closer Troy Percival wobbled through
the ninth, giving up a run and stranding two runners, but picked up
his 21st save. And the Angels moved with three games of the Seattle
Mariners in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   In Lackey's eyes, the evening lacked for nothing, even if he
didn't get the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a pennant race, all that matters is we win," Lackey
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey, 23, was superb in his third major league start, being
denied victory by inches. Chris Gomez hooked a line drive down the
left-field line in the seventh inning that just stayed fair for a
solo home run, tying the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, dormant most of the game, woke up for an eighth-inning
rally. Adam Kennedy led off with a single and David Eckstein, after
failing to sacrifice, looped a single to right, and both advanced on
a passed ball. Erstad followed by stroking a single to right, leaving
his bat in splinters at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "When they go like that, I call them warriors," Erstad said,
saluting. "It died a good death."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad also helped out by making a diving catch to take an
extra-base hit away from Aubrey Huff in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the best catch I have ever had behind me," Lackey said.
"I'll take a few of those. I get an out, even on a hit like that, it
was a good pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey is still absorbing the whole major league experience, which
included chasing down fly balls during batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done that my whole career," Lackey said. "If I sat in the
clubhouse, I'd just go crazy."</TE>
<TE>   After walking two batters in the first inning, Lackey settled
down.</TE>
<TE>   "That's his makeup," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said. "He's very
calm, but very aggressive. That's important in every pitcher, but
rare in a young pitcher. It allows him to pitch at a high level that
his experience wouldn't seem to allow."</TE>
<TE>   When Lackey did labor, the Angels helped him out. Gomez and Jared
Sandberg had consecutive singles to start the fifth inning, but
Eckstein fielded Randy Winn's sharp grounder and started a double
play.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Abernathy then caught third baseman Troy Glaus napping with
a bunt to score Gomez, but Lackey got Steve Cox on a ground out to
end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel pretty comfortable here," Lackey said. "Sure the talent
level is higher, but it's the same baseball game I have always
played."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel offense couldn't wait to get started, so it seemed, then
took a lengthy siesta.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein walked to lead off the first, sprinting to first base
after ball four. One out later, Tim Salmon smacked a 2-1 pitch over
the center field wall, giving him six runs batted in in the last five
games.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lineup, top to bottom, that is very aggressive," Salmon
said. "Whether it is David Eckstein at the top of the order or Bengie
Molina and Adam Kennedy at the bottom of the order, everyone is a
competitive hitter. It's not like we sit around thinking, 'It's my
turn to do it tonight,' but there are a lot of guys in this lineup
that can hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble was, none got around to it after Salmon's home run until
Erstad in the eighth inning.</TE>

<BD> Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Arizona Diamondbacks, looking to bolster their bullpen for the
second half of the season, acquired setup man Mike Fetters from
Pittsburgh for prospect Duaner Sanchez on Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Fetters is 1-0 with a 3.26 earned-run average in 32 relief
appearances this season and was 2-1 in 52 games for the Pirates since
they acquired him from the Dodgers for Terry Mulholland last season.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what you play the game for, a chance to win a
championship," Fetters said.</LD>
<TE>   Sanchez, 22, can throw in the mid-90s and was 0-0 with a 4.91 ERA
in six appearances with Arizona. He was assigned to the Pirates'
triple-A Nashville farm club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Five Cuban baseball stars have received permission from the
government to play with or coach teams in Japan for the rest of this
season, the Communist Party's official newspaper Granma reported.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Omar Linares will play with the Chunichi Dragons.
First baseman Orestes Kindelan, with nearly 400 home runs, will play
with the amateur team Sidas, as will second baseman Antonio Pacheco.
Outfielder Luis Ulacia will work as a coach, as will shortstop German
Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Green Will Skip the Derby</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>All-Star right fielder Shawn Green has been on the fence all week,
unable to decide whether to participate in Monday's home run derby in
Milwaukee. Saturday, Manager Jim Tracy and the Dodgers nudged him off
it.</LD>
<LD>   Green, who sat out two games after suffering a jammed left thumb
June 29 but has played the past four games with the injury, will not
join Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, et al in the home run contest.</LD>
<LD>   "That thumb needs extra time to mend, and I would hate to see
something funky happen in the home run derby," Tracy said. "To me, it
doesn't seem to make sense to take a chance. We talked to him about
it, and I said I'd rather he didn't push it. I don't want it to be
bothering him Thursday [when the Dodgers open the second half with a
four-game series against Arizona]."</LD>
<TE>   Green is tied for third in the National League with 26 home runs,
four of them in his record-setting game in Milwaukee's Miller Park on
May 23.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to do it, but it's smart not to do it," Green said. "The
home run derby is the most enjoyable event of the All-Star game, but
in the grand scheme of things, it has no meaning. It would be stupid
to do it if you're going to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reserve catcher David Ross was hitless in three at-bats with a
walk Saturday, but his first major league start was anything but a
failure.</TE>
<TE>   Ross, filling in for starter Paul Lo Duca, did a solid job of
handling starter Hideo Nomo, whose split-fingered fastball can baffle
the most experienced of catchers, as well as relievers Giovanni
Carrara, Jesse Orosco, Paul Quantrill and Eric Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   He also threw out Edgar Renteria attempting to steal second base
to end the seventh inning, sprinting off the field and pounding
high-fives into the hands of his teammates in the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   "I got excited, I had a little adrenaline rush," said Ross, who
will be sent back to triple-A Las Vegas when Chad Kreuter is
activated Thursday. "Once I got used to Nomo's splitter and got the
nerves out of the way in the first inning, I was fine. I wished I
could have helped out at the plate a bit, but that's not what I'm
here for."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Though he had only two plate appearances Saturday, Lo Duca had two
singles, giving him nine multi-hit games in his last 12 games
played.... With Odalis Perez (10-4) and Kazuhisa Ishii (11-5), the
Dodgers have two starters entering the All-Star break with 10 or more
wins for the first time since 1977, when four Dodgers--Doug Rau
(11-1), Tommy John (10-4), Don Sutton (10-4) and Rick Rhoden
(10-6)--reached double figures before the break.</TE>

Tony La Russa pulled him from the rotation Saturday night. Among the
candidates to start today are right-handers Luther Hackman and Mike
Timlin or left-hander Mike Matthews. The Dodgers are 17-5 against
left-handed starters.</TE>

<HD>Better Late Than Ever for Lo Duca</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: He comes off bench to spark tying and winning
rallies against Cardinals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>The boss wanted to give Paul Lo Duca Saturday off, in order to pace
the Dodger catcher through these hot summer months, but Lo Duca still
wound up in the office, punching the clock in the late afternoon and
adding some punch to a sagging offense that worked overtime for a
victory.</LD>
<LD>   Lo Duca led off the ninth inning with a pinch-hit single, scored
the tying run on Eric Karros' double, and he singled during a two-run
11th inning to key the Dodgers' 4-2, come-from-behind victory over
the St. Louis Cardinals before 42,825 in Busch Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Miguel Cairo, a Cardinal second baseman who was inserted into the
outfield in the 10th inning, dropped Jeff Reboulet's bases-loaded,
no-out fly ball to shallow right, eliminating any chance of throwing
out Dave Roberts at the plate, as the Dodgers scored the go-ahead
run.</LD>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek's sacrifice fly gave the Dodgers a two-run
cushion, and closer Eric Gagne sealed the victory by striking out two
of three in the bottom of the 11th for his major league-leading 32nd
save.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge win, especially coming right before the All-Star
break," Lo Duca said after the Dodgers increased their National
League West lead over Arizona to 2 1/2 games. "This should give us
some more momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca was supposed to be at rest. He had caught the last 12
games, including five in the oppressive heat of Phoenix and St.
Louis, and with another day game against the Cardinals today, Manager
Jim Tracy wanted to give him a break Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But after St. Louis took a 2-1 lead in the eighth on Eli Marrero's
homer off reliever Giovanni Carrara--after Hideo Nomo's splendid
seven-inning, one-run, three-hit effort--Tracy turned to Lo Duca to
lead off the ninth against Cardinal closer Jason Isringhausen.</TE>
<TE>   The odds didn't favor the Dodgers. They were 0-33 when trailing
after eight innings before Saturday, and Isringhausen had converted
19 of 22 save opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca lined an 0-2 pitch to left for a single, Shawn Green lined
out to left, and Karros smashed an RBI double to the gap in
right-center to make it 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy pulled Karros for pinch-runner Hiram Bocachica, who was
stranded when Brian Jordan, who homered off Cardinal starter Woody
Williams in the fourth, and Grudzielanek struck out. Lo Duca remained
in the game at first base.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts drew a leadoff walk off left-hander Steve Kline in the
11th, Lo Duca singled to left, and Green walked to load the bases
before Cairo botched Reboulet's fly ball. Roberts has good speed, and
Cairo doesn't have a strong outfield arm, but a good throw would have
made it close.</TE>
<TE>   "We're winning, things are going well, and we're getting a lot of
breaks," Karros said. "This might be one of those years. Things have
been working out for us. Hopefully it will continue."</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing lucky about Lo Duca. He's batting .329 with five
homers, 23 doubles, 38 runs batted in and 41 runs, and his .390
average with runners in scoring position is the third best in the
league.</TE>
<TE>   With only 13 strikeouts in 328 plate appearances, his average of
one strikeout every 25.5 plate appearances makes him the
second-hardest player to fan in the league. Lo Duca has put to rest
any speculation that his .320 average, 25 homers and 90 RBIs in 2001,
his first full big league season, was a fluke.</TE>
<TE>   He also has done an outstanding job handling a pitching staff that
is as diverse in style as it is in ethnicity--the Dodger rotation,
which consists of two Japanese pitchers, Nomo and Kazuhisa Ishii,
Dominican left-hander Odalis Perez, Venezuelan left-hander Omar Daal
and right-hander Andy Ashby--leads the major leagues with 44 wins and
is second in the majors with a 3.42 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still in the weeds, I guess, this is two years in a row and
I'm still not getting noticed, but that's fine," Lo Duca said,
referring to his All-Star snub. "My job is to catch these pitchers
and to get on base for the big guys, and I'm happy with the way I've
played."</TE>
<TE>   He even performs well on the days he's not supposed to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice day off for Lo Duca, huh?" Tracy said. "As much as we've
caught him, we can't be in that saddle riding him all the time. But I
loved having him available to lead off the [ninth inning Saturday].
We had the spot we wanted to use him in. And fortunately, his spot
came up twice. He's as tough an out as there is in this league."</TE>

<HD>Ducks Get Sykora in Big Deal</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Seven-player trade lands New Jersey forward in
Anaheim for Tverdovsky, Friesen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks, continuing to search for offense and a winning
attitude, acquired high-scoring forward Petr Sykora on Saturday in a
seven-player trade with the New Jersey Devils.</LD>
<LD>   Sykora, 25, helped the Devils win the Stanley Cup in 2000 and two
seasons ago scored a career-high 81 points, among them a career-high
35 goals, in helping the Devils reach the finals.</LD>
<LD>   Though he slipped to 48 points last season, the Czech right wing,
along with newly signed free-agent center Adam Oates, is expected to
add much-needed punch to a Duck offense that scored fewer goals than
all but the Columbus Blue Jackets last season and ranked last on the
power play.</LD>
<TE>   Sykora scored an average of 27.5 goals over the last four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   To get him, the Ducks gave up defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky, 26, left
wing Jeff Friesen, 25, and a prospect, right wing Maxim Balmochnykh,
23.</TE>
<TE>   Also joining the Ducks are Mike Commodore, a 22-year-old
defenseman who is expected to step into the lineup; 22-year-old
goaltender J.F. Damphousse, who probably will start the season as
Jean-Sebastien Giguere's backup; and a prospect, right wing Igor
Pohanka, 19.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it for a real purpose, and that is to change the dressing
room, the chemistry on our hockey team," Duck General Manager Bryan
Murray said of the trade. "It's not necessarily a clean slate, but a
new slate.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a new coach [Mike Babcock] and hopefully these guys will
make a huge difference."</TE>
<TE>   For the Ducks, the centerpiece of the deal is Sykora, whose
surname is Czech for a type of bird. They hope he can take flight in
his new surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost some good players, who were a big part of the
organization," center Steve Rucchin said. "At the same time, we know
what kind of player Petr Sykora is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good step for the team. When you get new players, of this
quality, it usually pans out pretty good. I just hope our players
outperform their players in this deal."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Ducks had no one on their roster that had played
in a conference final. Now, they have a player who was the Devils'
leading goal-scorer in their consecutive runs to the finals, netting
19 goals in 48 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel that he has a huge ability to score goals," Murray said.
"Playing on a line or a team with Adam Oates and Paul Kariya, in
particular, we think he'll make a huge difference in our power play,
special-team areas that hurt us tremendously last year. He's an
offensive player with potential to probably get 70, 80 points for
us."</TE>
<TE>   Tverdovsky, meanwhile, had the potential to be a negative
influence. After last season, he met with then-general manager Pierre
Gauthier to complain about his role under Murray, who was then the
coach. The next day, Gauthier was fired. When Murray replaced him,
Tverdovsky's days with the team seemed numbered.</TE>
<TE>   The departure of Friesen leaves the Ducks with only a second-round
pick in next year's draft to show for the trade that sent Teemu
Selanne to the San Jose Sharks in March 2001. Goaltender Steve
Shields was dealt last month to the Boston Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Friesen, though, was a disappointment in the Ducks' eyes.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ducks apparently were a disappointment in Balmochnykh's
eyes. Playing for the Ducks' American Hockey League affiliate in
Cincinnati last season, Balmochnykh bolted in January and returned
home to Russia, where he was said to be contemplating signing with a
team in the Russian league.</TE>

<HD>Schmid Knows Way to (Rattle) San Jose</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Galaxy coach says the heat is on Earthquakes
tonight as they try to avenge Thursday's loss to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minutes after his team claimed its first "must-win" game of the
season, a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes, Galaxy Coach
Sigi Schmid was talking about how the "onus" was now on the Galaxy's
Northern California neighbors to pull out a win in the return match
at San Jose.</LD>
<LD>   Earthquake forward Landon Donovan was in another corner of the
Rose Bowl Thursday night, promising that the Galaxy "won't know what
hit them" come tonight at Spartan Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone ready for Round 2?</LD>
<TE>   Though the rivalry between Major League Soccer's two California
clubs got a jump-start at last October's MLS Cup title game, a match
San Jose won, 2-1, in overtime, the Galaxy and Earthquakes act as if
they've despised each other since the league's inception in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But while the Galaxy has long been a league power and has appeared
in three league championship games--losing each time--the upstart
Earthquakes won their title the first time they played for it ...
against the Galaxy.</TE>
<TE>   Bad blood? Sure. Plus, the Galaxy, which had dropped five of its
previous seven matches, needed a victory in the worst way Thursday in
the first game of the midseason home-and-home series against the
Western Division-leading Earthquakes.</TE>
<TE>   A loss would have dropped the Galaxy 12 points behind San Jose
entering tonight's game at intimate Spartan Stadium, where the
Earthquakes are 7-0 this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's much different playing at San Jose," Schmid said. "The
field's a lot smaller so they're able to play with that compactness
and they can keep things tight on an opponent ... and they
counterattack very well and have good speed."</TE>
<TE>   The Earthquakes employ their smothering 4-4-2 formation on the
pinball machine that is Spartan Stadium, which measures 70 yards by
110 yards when set up for soccer. The Rose Bowl's configuration for
soccer is 72 yards by 116 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "At least it's a field where it's easier to chase on," Schmid
said. "They can't hide from you as well since there's less space,
less acreage.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they're a team that's very comfortable playing on that
field....We have to be mentally sharp."</TE>
<TE>   The Earthquakes, whose midfield seemed a shambles at times
Thursday, will regain the services of veteran midfielder Richard
Mulrooney, who had to sit out after drawing a red card the previous
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   But San Jose was hit with injuries against the Galaxy as defender
Troy Dayak (strained groin) and midfielder Ian Russell (right calf
strain) left at halftime. Their status for tonight was unknown.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy did not escape unscathed. Defender Tyrone Marshall went
down with a strained groin and did not travel with the team.</TE>
<TE>   But with the rest of the team relatively healthy, Marshall's
absence shouldn't hurt the Galaxy as much as it would have earlier,
when as many as five starters were out with injuries and Cobi Jones
was at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   With Marshall out, expect deposed starter Danny Califf to reclaim
his spot or, possibly, Craig Waibel to get the call.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime you have [internal] competition, it's a good thing,"
Schmid said. "Our big problem has been that we really haven't been
able to train together as a unit."</TE>

<HD>Sorenstam Keeps Her Cool in Open Heat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shrinking list of challengers all made costly bogeys on the 18th
hole, allowing Annika Sorenstam to get out of the sweltering sun with
a two-stroke lead Saturday in the U.S. Women's Open at Hutchinson,
Kan.</LD>
<LD>   She says the tournament is far from over.</LD>
<LD>   It sure doesn't look that way.</LD>
<TE>   Prairie Dunes might have met its match in Sorenstam, who lived up
to her reputation as the most dominant player in women's golf with
her third consecutive round of par or better, this time a one-under
69 to take a two-stroke lead over Jill McGill and Juli Inkster.</TE>
<TE>   The 31-year-old Swede, who already has won half of her 12
tournaments this year including a major championship, hit every
fairway and missed only three greens on a course that demands
precision at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   She seized control with a 12-foot birdie on the tough, 400-yard
16th hole after a booming drive that split the fairway and an
eight-iron into the green.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam finished at 208, the only player still under par.</TE>
<TE>   And she sounds like she's just warming up.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hitting the ball as well as I can," Sorenstam said. "I know
my game is good enough to win, so I don't worry about everyone else."</TE>
<TE>   She might not have to.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam will be paired with McGill, best known for turning down
an offer to pose for Playboy magazine. McGill has never won on the
LPGA Tour, and today will be her first time in the final group--at
the biggest championship in women's golf, no less.</TE>
<TE>   She is in contention after shooting a 69, which included a
round-saving bogey after hitting into waist-high weeds on No. 13 and
a disappointing bogey on the final hole that dropped her to 210.</TE>
<TE>   Along with trying to contain her nerves, McGill will be playing
with someone who has had to hit out of the rough only once in the
last two days.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a machine," McGill said. "I wouldn't expect her to make any
drastic mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Also at 210 is Inkster, who can thank her brilliant short game for
still having a chance. She hit only eight greens and escaped with a
71. Seven par saves--four from the six-foot range--kept alive her
hopes of becoming the Open's oldest champion. Fay Crocker was 40
years, 11 months when she won in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep telling myself that I'm close," the 42-year-old Inkster
said. "I think I'm going to have to go with what I've got. I have to
play better."</TE>
<TE>   The problem they face is that Sorenstam has the same objective.</TE>
<TE>   "My game plan is to hit every fairway and every green," Sorenstam
said, "and not worry about anything else."</TE>
<TE>   Shani Waugh of Australia also stayed in the picture, thanks to a
30-foot eagle putt on No. 7 and solid play along the back nine until
a bogey on 18 dropped her to a 71. She was at one-over 211 and will
play with Inkster.</TE>
<TE>   Those might be the only players with legitimate chances. Michele
Redman holed a 155-yard shot from the ninth fairway for eagle, but
she had two short lip-outs on the back nine and finished with a 73,
five strokes behind.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz, who started the third round tied for the lead at one
under with Sorenstam and Inkster, bogeyed four of five holes in the
middle of her round and shot 77.</TE>
<TE>   The wind wasn't nearly as strong as it had been the previous two
rounds as thunderstorms threatened throughout the day.</TE>
<TE>   Inkster is still in the hunt despite not hitting the ball where
she wants it to go. She didn't hit a green in regulation until No. 4,
and spent most of the afternoon making one clutch par putt after
another.</TE>
<TE>   "It just takes one or two good shots, and I'm on my way," Inkster
said.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether that will be enough to catch Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Allenby followed an eagle on the par-five 15th with a
birdie and shot a seven-under 65 to take a two-stroke lead in the
third round of the Western Open at Lemont, Ill.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to tomorrow," said Allenby, the 2000
champion, who was at 15-under 201 after 54 holes. "I'm feeling pretty
comfortable and confident with the way I'm playing."</TE>
<TE>   Neal Lancaster was at 203 after a five-under 67. Jerry Kelly and
Bob Estes were at 204, and Davis Love III and second-round leader
John Cook were at 205.</TE>
<TE>   "Eleven under with one round to go, I'm still in pretty good
shape," said Love, who had birdies on his last two holes to stay in
contention.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Appleby held the lead at 13 under through 11 holes, but his
second shot on the par-four 13th missed the green, rolled downhill,
across a cart path and finally settled behind three trees.</TE>
<TE>   He had a double bogey on the hole and is at 206, five strokes
behind Allenby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Campbell birdied the 18th to take a one-stroke lead over
Padraig Harrington and Paul Lawrie after three rounds of the European
Open at Straffan, Ireland.</TE>

<HD>Megahertz Negotiates a Bumpy Stretch Drive</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Favorite is declared winner of American Oaks
after Dublino is placed second for interference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ultimately, the inaugural American Oaks had a predictable finish
Saturday at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Megahertz, the 19-10 favorite in the field of 14 3-year-old
fillies, kept her record perfect in the United States, but she needed
some help from above.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, Hollywood Park stewards Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and
George Slender, who, from their perch on the roof above the press
box, ruled that original winner Dublino interfered in the stretch.
Dublino was placed second.</LD>
<TE>   A daughter of Lear Fan making her U.S. debut in the $500,000 race
for trainer Laura De Seroux, Dublino, the 4-1 second choice, crossed
the wire first by a half-length in 2:00 2/5 for the 1 1/4 miles on
turf, but various replays indicated the right decision was made.</TE>
<TE>   Megahertz, who is five of five for owner Michael Bello and trainer
Bobby Frankel, was bumped solidly by Dublino. Jockey Alex Solis also
said his filly was hit twice by the whip of Kent Desormeaux, who rode
Dublino.</TE>
<TE>   "She was flying down the stretch when the other filly came out and
bumped her," said Solis, who was forced to rally widest of all after
trailing early. "Then, she got struck twice in the face, too, by
[Desormeaux's] whip and it really messed up my momentum. It really
cost her the race.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an incredible filly. There were 14 horses and the last
three-eighths I had to come around because there wasn't too much room
anywhere else. She ran a great race."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, De Seroux, who trains Dublino for a partnership
that includes Michael Klein, the son of the late Gene Klein, wasn't
happy with the stewards' decision. Neither was a group of fans near
the winner's circle, who greeted the announcement with loud boos.</TE>
<TE>   "Alex didn't stop riding," she said. "Dublino's the winner in my
opinion. It's very disheartening because I didn't think Megahertz
ever lost her momentum. To bring a filly off one race this year [on
April 14 at Longchamp in France] and to bring her to a race like
this, 2 1/2 months between races, I'm pretty disheartened. We'll be
back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   E Dubai, whose participation was uncertain until Friday night, led
all the way to win the $500,000 Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Godolphin Stable and trained by Saeed bin Suroor, the
4-year-old Mr. Prospector colt and 9-2 third choice slowed things
down early under jockey John Velasquez, then repelled a challenge
from 5-2 second choice Lido Palace to win by a three-quarters of a
length in 2:00 4/5 for the 1 1/4 miles. Macho Uno, the 11-10
favorite, was third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Richard Dutrow Jr. picked up the first Grade I victory of
his career when Carson Hollow remained unbeaten with a two-length
victory in the $200,000 Prioress at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   Carson Hollow, a New York-bred daughter of Carson City owned by
Hemlock Hills Farm, Gabrielle Farm, Justine Zimmerman and Sanford
Goldfarb, was the 4-1 third choice in the field of seven 3-year-old
fillies. She completed the six furlongs in 1:08 4/5 under Velasquez,
beating Spring Meadow, a 6-1 longshot, by two lengths. It was the
fourth consecutive victory for Carson Hollow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disqualified out of a victory in the 2001 United Nations Handicap,
With Anticipation got the money this time around in the $500,000
Grade I, winning a thriller against the Frankel-trained Denon and the
Neil Drysdale-trained Sarafan at Monmouth Park.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Pat Day for owner George Strawbridge's Augustin Farm and
trainer Jonathan Sheppard, the 7-year-old Relaunch gelding completed
the 1 3/8 miles in 2:12 2/5. Suances, the pacesetter under jockey
David Flores, finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disturbingthepeace, a 16-1 longshot, led virtually throughout to
win the $300,000 Triple Bend Breeders' Cup Handicap at Hollywood
Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by David and Rita Milch and trained by Darrell Vienna, the
4-year-old Bold Badgett gelding completed the seven furlongs in 1:21
in beating 5-1 longshot D'wildcat by three lengths. He was ridden by
Victor Espinoza. It was the California bred's fourth victory in a
row. Kona Gold, the 4-5 favorite, faded to sixth. It was only the
fourth time in his career that the 2000 Breeders' Cup Sprint winner
had finished worse than third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Surya, the 3-5 favorite, won for the third time in as many starts
in the U.S. when easily dispatching of her 11 rivals in the $114,800
Royal Heroine Stakes at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Flaxman Holdings, Ltd. and trained by Frankel, the
4-year-old Unbridled filly was kept wide by Desormeaux while rallying
and went on to beat 34-1 longshot Angel Gift by two lengths in 1:34
3/5 for the mile on turf.</TE>

<LD>The Huntington Beach Union High School District, which operates six
schools in Huntington Beach, Westminster and Fountain Valley, has cut
allocations to athletics and eliminated the job of district athletic
director because of a $3.5-million budget shortfall.</LD>
<LD>   The school board voted to cut funding for athletics and
co-curricular programs from its general fund by $50,000 and suspended
for one year extra allocations of $25,000 to Westminster High and

<HD>Tizbud to Make Debut</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a stakes-filled card on Saturday, things quiet considerably
today at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   The feature attraction is the $75,000 Great Lady M. Stakes for
fillies and mares at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf, but the most
interesting race on the program might be the third.</LD>
<LD>   The six-furlong main track sprint drew a field of seven
California-bred maidens and the colt breaking from the outside has
quite a family legacy to live up to as he makes his first start.</LD>
<TE>   Tizbud is by the sire Cee's Tizzy out of the mare Cee's Song,
making him a full brother to Tiznow, the only two-time winner of the
Breeders' Cup Classic, and multiple-stakes winner Budroyale.</TE>
<TE>   Bred by the late Cece Straub Rubens, Tizbud was originally in the
barn of Tiznow's trainer, Jay Robbins, but apparently two Breeders'
Cup victories weren't enough for owner Michael Cooper, and the colt
was transferred to John Sadler's stable. Tizbud is the 2-1 favorite
on the morning line.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 minutes before that race, Gygistar, a 3-year-old
Prospector's Music gelding, will try for his fourth consecutive win
and fifth in six starts in the $150,000 Dwyer at Belmont Park.</TE>
<TE>   His main rival in the field of six is Yankee Gentleman, who was
the beaten favorite in the Riva Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The sixth at Hollywood Park is a competitive
$62,000 allowance at one mile on the turf. The race brings out, among
others, comebackers Marine and Fateful Dream for trainer Bobby
Frankel and Special Ring, who went too fast for his own good in the
Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Johnny Show. The 5-year-old gelding will try for his
seventh win in a row in today's $50,000 Alamedan Handicap at
Pleasanton.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Roberto Gonzalez. The jockey opened Pleasanton winning
with only one of his first 20 mounts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Special Ring and Fateful
Dream in the sixth, The Station and Bluesthestandard in the seventh,
Go Go, Kalatiara and Twin Set in the eighth and Salish Slew and My
Darling Brocco in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 5/141. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $30.40/$811.80. Total money bet: $910.</TE>

<LD>If the real Ronnie Jace shows up tonight, the rest of the field is
running for second money in the eighth, a $12,550 allowance at 350
yards.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, who also owns the 3-year-old son of
Fishers Dash in partnership with Ron and Ronnie Keller, Ronnie Jace
was the champion 2-year-old gelding in California in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   He won five of 11, including three stakes victories, and has
trained well for his first start since Nov. 30. He will break from
the outside in the field of six and will be ridden by Alex Bautista.</LD>
<TE>   Leading trainer Paul Jones will try to beat Ronnie Jace with two
runners--Tux N Rolls and Miami Cartel. The former has won three of 10
while the latter, who will be handled by leading quarter horse jockey
Ramon Sanchez, has won three of 12.</TE>
<TE>   One of two fillies in the race, Famous Cartel has won two of seven
for trainer R C Howell but has been worse than third only once.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the daughter of Corona Cartel was second to
Santispac in the Stockton Derby on June 22.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Mirobolant. 2. Ima Big City Chick. 3. Zipolator. 4.
Murrieta Red. 5. Never Phoney. 6. Murr Key Blurr. 7. Proyen. 8.
Ronnie Jace. 9. Vels Silent Charger.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Murr Key Blurr and Splash Charger in the sixth, Proyen,
Free Ice and Drivers Seat in the seventh, Ronnie Jace and Famous
Cartel in the eighth and Vels Silent Charger and Ryland in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: L.B. Down shortens up and drops in class in the
first for trainer Craig Robertson. Flying Ts Cassie Ann makes her Los
Alamitos debut in the second having won two of four for trainer Dan
Thomas.</TE>

<HD>Waltrip Can Enjoy This Victory at Daytona</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, a win for Michael Waltrip to savor.</LD>
<LD>   Waltrip, whose only other career win was marred when Dale
Earnhardt died in the Daytona 500 last year, finished first again at
NASCAR's most famous track Saturday night, defeating Rusty Wallace in
a Pepsi 400 race that finished under caution at Daytona Beach, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Fans were upset that the race ended under caution. They pelted the
cars with debris in what appeared to be a protest to NASCAR's
inconsistency. There is no clear-cut rule on stopping races.</LD>
<TE>   Just as Earnhardt did when he finally broke through at the Daytona
500 in 1998--and as Dale Earnhardt Jr. did last year in his emotional
victory here--Waltrip celebrated by spinning doughnuts in the
infield.</TE>
<TE>   Waltrip led 99 of the 160 laps and held off his teammate,
Earnhardt, on a pair of late restarts that more or less decided the
race.</TE>
<TE>   "We led the whole last half of the race," Waltrip said. "I didn't
want to see it get away from me. The key was the way the car
handled."</TE>
<TE>   Counting Earnhardt's stirring victory here last year, in the first
race at Daytona since his dad's death, Dale Earnhardt Inc. cars have
won five of the last seven races on restrictor-plate tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Wallace had his best finish ever at Daytona. Winston Cup points
leader Sterling Marlin raced near the front all day and was third.</TE>
<TE>   The finish under yellow was fitting for a race that was run in
fits and starts.</TE>
<TE>   The worst wreck of the night came with 16 laps left. It sent
flames shooting out of Brett Bodine's car and sent many good cars,
including Dale Jarrett's, out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Tomas Scheckter won the pole for the IRL's Ameristar 200,
shattering the Kansas Speedway record and knocking his Red Bull
Cheever Racing owner and teammate off the front row as
Infiniti-powered cars took three of the top four spots at Kansas
City, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old South African turned in a fast lap of 218.547 mph
on his second time around the 1.5-mile tri-oval, just after defending
champion and 2002 points leader Sam Hornish Jr. set a short-lived
record of 217.743.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta rose to the challenge again, winning a shootout
with Paul Tracy to wrap up the pole for the CART Toronto Molson-Indy.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, who started the day third on the 18-car grid, took the top
spot with a 108.609 with just over two minutes remaining, but Da
Matta answered at 1:55 to go with a lap of 108.648, then kicked that
up to 108.678 just 45 seconds before the checkered flag.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Juan Pablo Montoya will be on the pole for the fourth consecutive
Formula One race. The BMW Williams driver clocked a time of 1 minute
18.998 seconds on his final lap of qualifying for today's British
Grand Prix at Silverstone, England.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya grabbed the pole on his final lap, bumping Ferrari's Ruben
Barrichello and Michael Schumacher from a 1-2 finish. Barrichello
qualified second in 1:19.032 and was followed by teammate Schumacher
in 1:19:042.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bliss won the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series O'Reilly Auto
Parts 250 at Kansas Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ben Walker of Santa Clarita continued to hold fast to the Miller
Lite Big 10 Challenge series as he won the 75-lap Jani-King Super
Late Model series feature before 4,496 at Irwindale Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   In the 75-lap Southern California Automobile Club Late Model

<HD>A Family Matter for Anderson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The father who was there only occasionally is going to the All-Star
game with the son who yearned for family and learned from that
youthful void to be more loving and attentive with his own children.</LD>
<LD>   Garret Anderson, the Angels' left fielder, isn't taking his three
young children on the red-eye to Milwaukee tonight, but he's taking
his wife, Teresa, and the mother who raised him, Leita Smith.</LD>
<LD>   He is also taking the father he was named for but has seen only
intermittently.</LD>
<TE>   And if Anderson's All-Star selection by Manager Joe Torre created
a new level of national respect and recognition for a player, as
Anderson put it, who has been looked on simply as "that West Coast
guy who plays a lot of games," maybe the decision to invite Garret
Sr. is an attempt to create a new level of respect and recognition
for their relationship as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty cool," Garret Jr. said. "He was my coach in Little
League and saw me learn the game. He's a lot like me and doesn't show
a lot of emotion, but I could tell when I called that he was proud
and excited to be included."</TE>
<TE>   Smith was 15 when she became a parent. She and Garret Sr., two
years older, tried to build a life together but failed. Her son, she
says, knew aunts, uncles and a grandmother, but there was no male
presence in the house. Tough love was the prescription, she believed.
They moved 11 times throughout the Los Angeles area, the television
becoming her son's companion while she worked.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a responsibility and took it seriously," Smith said. "I
think that's what Garret saw. It was hard on him and hard on me. He
wanted the closeness of a father and a big family, but there were
long periods when his dad just wasn't too involved. It's unfortunate,
and I've always prayed that Garret would accept what happened. He
took on a lot of my character as far as not showing much emotion, but
he's always had a lot of maturity. There were times I had to tell him
to go out and play because he felt he needed to stay in and keep me
company."</TE>
<TE>   Her son now is the father of Brianne, 5, Bailey 3, and 1-year-old
Trey, or Garret III. He and Teresa met in junior high school and were
married in 1993. He was in his fourth year in the Angels' system,
having passed on a Fresno State scholarship out of Granada Hills
Kennedy High after being taken in the fourth round of the 1990 draft.</TE>
<TE>   "I've come 180 degrees since high school," Anderson said. "All I
could do then was hit. I took some bad raps in the minors because I
simply didn't know how to play. I basically had to learn on my own,
although I have to give a lot of credit to [former Angel instructors]
Gene Richards and Lenny Sakata. They escalated my development, taught
me how to think and act like a major leaguer."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson learned he was an All-Star on his 30th birthday. He is in
his eighth season. His first-half pace projects to 30 home runs and
120 runs batted in, a virtual replay of 2001 (28 homers, 123 RBI) and
2000 (35, 117).</TE>
<TE>   Consistency is his hallmark.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter is the only major leaguer with more hits in the last
five years. The only American Leaguer to have played more games since
the start of the 1997 season is Rafael Palmeiro.</TE>
<TE>   Of his new recognition (the All-Star selection gives him a $25,000
bonus and increases his $5-million salary next year by $350,000),
Anderson said:</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't deserve it the first five years because I hadn't put up
the numbers. The last two ... well, they can say, 'Everybody can have
one year,' but then I had a second and now I'm doing it again, and it
had started to bother me. When you start putting up 100-plus RBIs and
30-plus homers, that's when the recognition comes, and I knew it
would if I continued doing it. It's not that I was looking for
anything special, just what I deserved."</TE>
<TE>   Batting .295 through Friday, Anderson was listed among league
leaders in RBIs, doubles, total bases, extra base hits and several
other categories.</TE>
<TE>   Coming up to his prime years, with those eight years of
experience, Anderson said he should be ranked "at the top or in the
upper third" of AL outfielders and "I feel that I still have room in
my ceiling to move up to another level."</TE>
<TE>   In the process, the stoicism he inherited from his mom and dad has
tended to mask his intelligence and determination. As a public
figure, he said, his wife has been working on him to become more
open, and he has shown a willingness, more often at least recognizing
his responsibilities as a veteran leader behind clubhouse doors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Darin Erstad risks life and limb in center field,
Anderson continues to take hits for that unemotional demeanor.
Critics on the fringe see it as uncaring, citing his refusal to dive
in the outfield as one example.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, however, was openly angry at being moved out of the more
demanding and glamorous center field in the spring of 2001, expressed
his displeasure once and only once (as is his pattern), met with
Manager Mike Scioscia ("I respect authority and will always do what
the team feels is best") and has moved on. He insists that
appropriate positioning doesn't require him to dive and that his
value to the Angels stems from his consistent availability.</TE>
<TE>   He had made only two errors in the last 233 games through Friday
and missed only one game since the start of the 2001 season. That
came last season when he flew home from Kansas City to accompany
daughter Bailey, who is autistic, to a doctor's appointment, then
returned to Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson is reluctant to talk about Bailey's condition, believing
people will think he is using it as an excuse if he plays poorly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like I'm sitting there saying, 'Why me?' " he said. "We
deal with it and go on."</TE>
<TE>   If his mother provided context and stability at a fragile time,
the absence of his father served in a curious way as a reminder of
where his focus should always be.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a decent relationship, considering he wasn't in the
house when I was growing up," Anderson said. "It makes a world of
difference to a child to have both parents there. My dad lives in
L.A. and we live in Tustin and I know he'd be there for me if I
needed him, but I've been concentrating on being a dad myself."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, he will focus on being an All-Star, and maybe
the two Garrets will emerge a little closer in the process.</TE>

<HD>Alou Homers Twice, Kimm Gets First Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Kimm didn't get showered with beer, and no one smeared shaving
cream on his face.</LD>
<LD>   The Chicago Cubs' interim manager celebrated his first major
league victory simply, enjoying a plateful of food and a bottle of
water in his clubhouse office.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Zambrano gave up two hits over five innings and Moises Alou
hit two homers to help the Cubs beat the Braves, 7-3, at Atlanta on
Saturday night in Kimm's first game since Don Baylor was fired.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm feeling good," Kimm said. "This is a special win because it's
my first win as a major league manager, but what really makes it
special is we did it against a Hall of Famer like [Tom] Glavine."</TE>
<TE>   Sammy Sosa sat out his second consecutive game because of a family
emergency, and he's not expected back for today's series finale.</TE>
<TE>   Kimm, a former major league catcher, spent six seasons managing in
the minors before replacing Baylor. In his first game, Kimm put
second baseman Mark Bellhorn in the leadoff spot and the move paid
off immediately. Bellhorn walked in the first to start a three-run
rally and later hit a solo home run.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Patterson, who normally bats first, originally was dropped
to No. 6 in the order but was scratched because of a sore foot, and
Roosevelt Brown started in his place.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor was dismissed Friday, and bench coach Rene Lachemann ran
the team in Friday night's 4-3 loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs won for only the third time in 12 games and ended
Atlanta's three-game winning streak. Alou finished four for four, the
18th four-hit game of his career. He also had four hits June 29
against the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   "This was better, because we won the game," Alou said. "We needed
to win a couple before the break."</TE>
<TE>   Florida 5, New York 2--Michael Tejera (5-1) gave up five hits and
two runs in a career-high 7 1/3 innings at Miami to win his fourth
consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   He left to a standing ovation after giving up a two-run home run
to Roberto Alomar in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 6, Milwaukee 4--Jason LaRue drove in four runs with a
bases-loaded double and a run-scoring single for the Reds at
Cincinnati. Jimmy Haynes (10-6) gave up 10 hits in 6 1/3 innings. He
left after a two-run homer by Richie Sexson, his 19th, cut the Reds'
lead to 6-4.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Philadelphia 3--Brad Wilkerson homered for the third
consecutive game and Fernando Tatis and Andres Galarraga also hit
home runs for the Expos at Philadelphia. The Expos, winners of three
consecutive, have outhomered their opponents, 20-9, during a 12-game
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, San Diego 2--Todd Zeile got his 1,000th run batted in
and John Thomson won for the first time in eight starts to lift the
Rockies at Denver. Zeile, who went three for four with two singles
and a double, snapped a 2-2 tie with a two-out single in the third
inning. Larry Walker went two for four and raised his league-leading
batting average to .351.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 10, Pittsburgh 2--Daryle Ward hit the first homer to land
in the river beyond PNC Park's right-field wall on the fly, a grand
slam that was among three Astro homers at Pittsburgh. Lance Berkman
took over the major league lead with his 29th homer, and Jeff Bagwell
also homered.</TE>

<HD>Bonds' Bat Does Talking in 3-2 Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds ended a 10-game drought with his first home run against
Randy Johnson. How he felt about it is anybody's guess.</LD>
<LD>   As has been the case recently, Bonds refused to talk to reporters
after the San Francisco Giants' 3-2 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson talked, but not about Bonds' homer.</LD>
<TE>   "Anybody else?" he said when the subject was brought up.</TE>
<TE>   That left it to Giant Manager Dusty Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never easy to get Randy," Baker said. "Barry got one today,
but Randy's won most of the battles."</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow singled in the go-ahead run against reliever Matt Mantei
in the eighth inning after Arizona had rallied to tie the score, 2-2,
on Craig Counsell's two-out single with the bases loaded in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Baker marveled at the number of clutch performances.</TE>
<TE>   "We got 'em, they got 'em," he said. "Boy, it was hard-fought down
to the end. The crowd was into it. That was like straight-up playoff,
World Series atmosphere right there."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, the only left-hander in the lineup, had gone 33 at-bats
without a home run, his longest lull this season, and 31 at-bats
against Johnson without a homer.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson struck out five in a row leading up to Bonds' homer, the
first four on 13 pitches. But on a 2-and-0 count with two out in the
sixth inning, Bonds slammed one 417 feet onto the porch in
right-center field, his 26th home run.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson struck out 10 in seven innings to move ahead of Don Sutton
into sixth on the career strikeout list with 3,583 but failed to win
for the second consecutive start. He gave up two runs and seven hits
and walked one.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I pitched pretty well," said Johnson, who appeared to
be in a foul mood after the game. "I made a couple of questionable
pitches, but you go out there and grind and do your best."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So, the Boston Red Sox complete a five-game sweep of the Toronto Blue
Jays, and Commissioner Bud Selig can forget about lifting his gag
order on fellow owners. The standings speak eloquently about
competitive imbalance.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that the Minnesota Twins, once bound for contraction,
and a couple other smaller revenue teams are in the playoff hunt, but
it's also numbingly true that an unprecedented six teams--San Diego
and Milwaukee in the National League and Toronto, Tampa Bay, Detroit
and Kansas City in the American--are arriving at the All-Star break
on pace to lose 100 or more games.</LD>
<LD>   Mismanagement may be a factor, but Red Sox Chief Executive Larry
Lucchino quickly picked up the Selig script and hammered the point.</LD>
<TE>   "Competitive imbalance is alive and well in Major League
Baseball," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no one has taken more advantage of those four AL
patsies than the Red Sox. They started the weekend 23-4 against the
Blue Jays, Tigers, Royals and Devil Rays compared to 1-11 in their
interleague games against Atlanta, Arizona and the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Owners are speaking out on labor issues because Selig, stressing a
united front as the union's executive board meets Monday in Chicago
to discuss a possible strike date, lifted his threat of a $1-million
fine, providing owners stick to the negotiating points outlined in a
memo they received from the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Houston Astro owner Drayton McLane promptly got into an exchange
with his closer, Billy Wagner, who seemed to be mocking McLane's
theme of "what have you done to make us a champion?" when he said
"you can't be a champion" when cutting veterans and asking too many
young players to play above their heads.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand Drayton and the money issue," Wagner said. "That's
OK, but don't say we're going to be champions when you don't give us
a chance."</TE>
<TE>   McLane said he respects Wagner, but the Astros have lost more than
$160 million in nine years and no one can continue to subsidize that
pattern.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a terrible system in baseball," McLane said. "It works
for four teams--the Yankees, Mets, Red Sox and Dodgers. They all have
payrolls in excess of $100 million. Clubs can't continue to take
substantial losses and stay in business. We're hurting the game when
success is narrowed to only a few teams."</TE>
<TE>   Border War</TE>
<TE>   Phil Nevin and Ryan Klesko, insisting they spoke for a majority,
reacted to a rash of pitching injuries and staff turnover by saying
that inflexible guidelines in the San Diego minor league system were
not preparing young starters to pitch at the big league level because
they are not permitted to pitch out of late-inning jams. At the same
time, Nevin said, relievers in the minors are being overtaxed, which
is why "many of them are blowing out" after joining the Padres.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego started the weekend having used 27 pitchers this year,
including infielder D'Angelo Jimenez in a rout. Eight of the pitchers
were making their major league debuts, combining for a 3-10 record
and 7.54 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Suggesting Nevin and Klesko were far off base, General Manager
Kevin Towers said the guidelines were designed to protect young
starters from injuries, and that while some of those who debuted this
year may not have been ready, they will all benefit from the
experience, particularly when the club moves into its new ballpark in
2004.</TE>
<TE>   That's no solace to Nevin or Klesko, but Ted Simmons, the club's
vice president of player development and scouting, wasn't offering
sympathy when he told the San Diego Union-Tribune that "Nevin has no
idea of what we're doing in the minor leagues. If he can rehab [from
a broken arm] to the extent that he can get back on the field and run
minor league operations at the same time, then he's a very
interesting man. My recommendation is that he stick to rehabbing, and
he stick to getting himself back on the field."</TE>
<TE>   Influence Peddling</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, the Blue Jays traded Raul Mondesi to the Yankees to get
out from under his contract and continue rebuilding, but dealing him
for a minor league player who is more suspect than prospect
underscored concern that his erratic behavior--in and out of
uniform--was having a negative influence on Felipe Lopez, the
talented young shortstop who prompted the Blue Jays to trade Cesar
Izturis to the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the Yankees' acquisition of Mondesi closes the door on
Cliff Floyd, leaving Seattle, Boston and San Francisco as the rumored
front-runners for the Florida Marlin right fielder. Floyd had
summoned agent Seth Levinson to Miami on Tuesday in a futile bid to
reach a long-term agreement with the Marlins. He now believes a trade
before the July 31 non-waiver deadline is inevitable and is mystified
why his overtures drew no response when Mike Sweeney and Bob Abreu
recently got long-term deals from Kansas City and Philadelphia and
neither of those teams is "as good as us."</TE>
<TE>   Broken Bats</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to know what the fired Don Baylor was expected to do
differently when his underachieving Chicago Cub offense was near the
bottom in virtually every National League category, utility man Mark
Bellhorn had more home runs (10) than Moises Alou, Todd Hundley and
Alex Gonzalez, touted second baseman Bobby Hill batted .182 before
returning to the minors and ballyhooed Corey Patterson had a .320
on-base percentage in the leadoff role. If Sammy Sosa didn't do it,
the Cubs didn't do it. Worse yet, as coach Rene Lachemann told them
in a blistering clubhouse meeting on Friday, they went about it as if
they didn't care.</TE>

<LD>More important than the record, more enduring than the statistics,
this year's Dodgers have carved out a perception that would make
Sally Field proud.</LD>
<LD>   You like them. You really like them.</LD>
<LD>   You like that their catcher points to the heavens in honor of his
late mother every time he crosses home plate.</LD>
<TE>   Has there ever been less pining for Mike Piazza?</TE>
<TE>   You like that their left fielder soothes the clubhouse instead of
setting it ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody still miss Gary Sheffield?</TE>
<TE>   You like it that their best hitter lurks around with the
uncertainty of a high school sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   You like it that their best pitcher struts around with the
excitement of a high school hockey player.</TE>
<TE>   And you love it that this year's three biggest impact
additions--Dave Roberts, Cesar Izturis and that pitcher, Eric
Gagne--all make $300,000 or less.</TE>
<TE>   For how many consecutive summers has this town been hollering at
bums who made $300,000 per pitch?</TE>
<TE>   Of all the Dodger accomplishments during the season's first half,
there is only one assured of enduring the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   It has been their most difficult and important accomplishment of
all.</TE>
<TE>   They have made people cheer for them again.</TE>
<TE>   It is a cheering not out of duty or season-ticket responsibility,
but out of genuine affection for a team that is behaving like a team.</TE>
<TE>   The most beloved Dodger team since Gibby and Bulldog and the Stunt
Men.</TE>
<TE>   The most promising mix of new Dodger faces since the appearance of
Garvey, Lopes, Russell and the Penguin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the sort of thing we had at CBS and Warner Brothers, people
relying on each other, people who weren't afraid of teamwork. I
didn't know why we couldn't have that here."</TE>
<TE>   Talking is Bob Daly. But don't tell anybody. The Dodger chairman
doesn't give interviews on his team. He wants to stay in the
background. He wouldn't talk to me if the interview would involve
anything other than the baseball labor situation.</TE>
<TE>   So when I phoned him the other day, I asked one question about
labor. But I couldn't stomach anymore.</TE>
<TE>   When thinking about a strike, which seems to be the only thing
that could keep the Dodgers out of the playoffs, I don't question, I
chant.</TE>
<TE>   The players aren't that dumb ... the players aren't that dumb ...
the players aren't that dumb.</TE>
<TE>   So I stopped talking about labor and started talking about the
Dodgers and, well, Daly slipped. I knew he would. He loves his team
too much to keep quiet about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I'm the father looking down on all this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The father who endured the mother of all criticism.</TE>
<TE>   He hired untested Jim Tracy as the manager and was toasted.</TE>
<TE>   He hired unknown Dan Evans as the general manager and was basted.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy is going to his first All-Star game. Evans is hotter than
Shawn Green. Daly shows up late in batting practice, stands behind
the batting cage in rumpled shirt and tie, and chuckles.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wondered why I didn't go after the big names. People
thought it was because I wanted to run the team myself, but that
wasn't true," he said. "I wanted people who weren't afraid to hire
strong people to work with them. People who weren't afraid to rely on
each other."</TE>
<TE>   Where else, indeed, would you have a second-year manager who
agrees to have two former major league managers--Jim Riggleman and
Glenn Hoffman--on his bench?</TE>
<TE>   And where else is there a rookie general manager willing to share
the stage, despite one notable early miscommunication, with vice
presidents named Tom Lasorda and Dave Wallace?</TE>
<TE>   "We have leaders who aren't afraid to say they don't know
everything," Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   The ego-bloated Dodger front office and dugout of recent years
were not like that. Players fought in the showers, the general
manager nearly fought in the stands, and who can forget the time
Davey Johnson purposely got himself thrown out of a game after he
knew he was fired?</TE>
<TE>   Contrast that with the situation that occurs in the dugout before
every Dodger game this season. The players line up, put their hands
together, and perform a schoolboy cheer like a team full of Mickey
Hatchers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever seen that before," Daly said. "But that
is what I'm talking about."</TE>
<TE>   I thought career minor league Roberts would be a bust in center
field. But he has leaned on former Dodger Maury Wills for advice, and
has become the team's first true leadoff hitter since Brett Butler.</TE>
<TE>   I thought Eric Karros was disappearing at first base. But he spent
the winter strengthening his back, then followed Tracy's orders to
become more of a situational hitter, and the boos have stopped.</TE>
<TE>   I thought Izturis was too inexperienced to be a regular shortstop.
But he makes all the routine plays and, on this team, routine is
perfect.</TE>
<TE>   I thought there was no way Gagne could be a closer. But I had no
idea he would show up this spring looking as big as Eric Lindros.</TE>
<TE>   Until last week, I also thought the other shoe would drop. The
Dodgers were lucky. The pitching was freaky. Reality would strike.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Monday, that shoe dropped right on Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   And on Friday, with bases loaded and none out, it dropped on Jim
Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   And on Saturday, in the top of the ninth inning, it dropped on
Jason Isringhausen.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers start their post-All Star break schedule Thursday with
an 11-game home stand.</TE>
<TE>   They end the season with a six-game home stand against Colorado
and San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a complete collapse in a league with few other contenders,
there's a legitimate possibility the town will not hear the sound of
the other shoe.</TE>
<TE>   Green will have to prove he is a big-game hitter. Tracy will have
to show he can be a big-game manager. The return of Darren Dreifort
and Kevin Brown must be handled carefully amid a clubhouse that is
doing fine without them.</TE>
<TE>   But the chances they could make the playoffs for the first time in
six years--and even win a playoff game for the first time in 14
years--are real.</TE>
<TE>   Just like those cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to what was once a Dodger town, halfway through a summer
in which it could become one again.</TE>

<HD>Morgan Barely Misses a 59</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LaSALLE, Canada</DL>
<LD>Walter Morgan beat the score he was going for and just missed golf's
magic number.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan tied the Senior PGA Tour record with an 11-under-par 60 on
Saturday--just missing birdie putts on the final two holes--and moved
within two shots of co-leaders Tom Jenkins and Morris Hatalsky after
two rounds of the Canada Senior Open.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't really thinking about shooting a 59," said Morgan, who
is 61. "I was just trying to shoot my age."</LD>
<TE>   Morgan had 12 birdies in bettering the Essex Golf and Country Club
record of 63 tied by Jenkins in Friday's opening round of the
$1.6-million event.</TE>
<TE>   He matched Isao Aoki's senior tour record of 10-under 60--set in
the second round of the 1997 Emerald Coast Classic--and had two
chances to match golf's magic score--59.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan left an eight-foot birdie putt on the lip at No. 17 and
barely missed a 13-footer for birdie on the final hole.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who had an opening-round 73, had one blemish on his
scorecard Saturday--a bogey on the par-four 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Three players have shot a 59 on the PGA Tour--Al Geiberger, Chip
Beck and David Duval--and Annika Sorenstam is the only player to do
it on the LPGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's last victory came at the 1996 Ameritech Senior Open.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins and Hatalsky each were at 11-under 131, one stroke in
front of Bruce Lietzke, who had a 62 on Saturday, and two in front of
Morgan and Bruce Summerhays, who had a second-round 65.</TE>
<TE>   Hatalsky's second-round 64 featured eagles on Nos. 10 and 13, both
par fives. Jenkins had two bogeys in his 68.</TE>

<LD>The root of all evil has wormed its way to the surface again, but not
everything that has to do with money has been bad this past week.
Some of it, yes, but not all.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea, for instance, managed to turn an unseemly squabble
over World Cup bonuses into a public relations coup.</LD>
<LD>   The Korean Football Assn. awarded each of the 23 players who
helped the country finish fourth a tidy 300 million won, or $251,500.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Guus Hiddink, who masterminded the campaign, pocketed the
same amount, to go along with the $1 million he had been given
earlier because Korea advanced past the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, meanwhile, decided that as long as its players couldn't
get their hands on the gold cup, they should at least be able to
garner something for finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   So the Turkish Football Assn. showered its players with 300 gold
coins apiece, and Coach Senol Gunes received 600.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that our players are not playing for money," TFA head
Haluk Ulusoy said when Turkey reached the quarterfinals, "but we
will, of course, try to give them a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   Of course.</TE>
<TE>   The Turkish government, sensing a mint to be made, produced the
first of what will be 300,000 commemorative silver coins honoring the
Turkish team for its achievement.</TE>
<TE>   The coins, being sold at $9 apiece, feature the names of the
Turkish players on the obverse.</TE>
<TE>   Time for Ronaldo</TE>
<TE>   Brazil, which won the World Cup, has made no mention of bonuses
for its players, but Ronaldo has taken matters into his own hands. Or
at least his own wrist.</TE>
<TE>   The striker is embroiled in a legal dispute with Montega, a Swiss
watch company from which he is seeking $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo several years ago signed a $5.2-million contract with
Montega to promote its R9 watch--R for Ronaldo's name and 9 for his
number--but claims that the company paid him $1.2 million, then
stopped payments once he was sidelined because of a series of knee
injuries that curtailed his public appearances on behalf of the
company.</TE>
<TE>   Montega is trying to get the $1.2 million returned. The squabble
is headed for arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   The Taxman Cometh</TE>
<TE>   Two days after he had helped Brazil win the World Cup, midfielder
Rivaldo was handed a $1.77-million demand by Spanish tax authorities,
who claimed he had not paid taxes on "image rights" income he
received from his club, Barcelona, and Catalan television between
1997 and 1999.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Spanish daily newspaper El Pais, under Spanish
law "a player can deduct a maximum of 15% of his total image rights,
the rest is considered like salary [and hence taxable]."</TE>
<TE>   Rivaldo is disputing the claim.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, former Dutch stars Ruud Gullit, Marco Van Basten and
Frank Rijkaard accepted a prison sentence of three months from an
Italian court for tax evasion that occurred during their playing time
with AC Milan more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   None of the three will actually serve any time behind bars. Under
Italy's often peculiar laws, a three-month sentence converts into a
fine of $1,465, which the three readily paid.</TE>
<TE>   Compensation, Please</TE>
<TE>   Bayern Munich, the club that traditionally produces most of
Germany's national team players--although Bayer Leverkusen did so
this year--is looking greedy and is threatening to set a troublesome
precedent by its latest action.</TE>
<TE>   The club is seeking some sort of financial settlement from the
DFB, the German soccer federation, for the injury that midfielder
Sebastian Deisler suffered while playing for the national team
against Austria in May.</TE>
<TE>   The right knee injury knocked the promising Deisler, 22, off the
World Cup roster and will keep him out for another five months.</TE>
<TE>   Bayern Munich wants compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that we must come to some agreement on this," former
national team player Uli Hoeness, now Bayern's commercial manager,
told the German sports news agency SID.</TE>
<TE>   If the DFB agrees, it could open a multitude of problems
worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Money, Money, Money</TE>
<TE>   One reason top clubs such as Bayern Munich get into frequent
arguments with their respective national associations is the amount
of money they stand to make or lose in European club competitions.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Real Madrid's victory in the European Champions
League this season netted the Spanish club an astonishing $36.36
million.</TE>
<TE>   That was the lion's share of the $520 million that the Union of
European Football Assns. (UEFA) paid out to the 32 teams that played
in the Champions League.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen, which finished second, earned not much less at
$33 million, and Manchester United and Bayern Munich each netted more
than $30 million.</TE>
<TE>   England Wins, for Once</TE>
<TE>   According to the accounting firm of Deloitte and Touche, the
English Premier League's income rose 18% to $1.9 billion in the
2000-2001 season, the latest for which figures are available.</TE>
<TE>   That makes the Premier League the world's richest.</TE>
<TE>   "If the World Cup had been based on finance and economics, we'd be
bringing the trophy home right now," Gerry Boon, head of Deloitte and
Touche sport, told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   "The business of football should not be compared to the Internet
world of boom and bust," Boon said. "Football clubs are far more
robust and resilient than many dotcoms ever were....</TE>
<TE>   "Football is not just a few smart guys with a new idea and a pile
of venture capital funding. This is a real business indelibly woven
into the fabric of national life."</TE>
<TE>   All of which will come as no comfort to the family of Nelson Hu,
the manager of a Hong Kong clothing export company who asphyxiated
himself by setting a fire in the sealed bathroom of his home in
Bangkok, Thailand, last week after racking up World Cup gambling
debts of $238,000.</TE>

<DL>MANKATO, Minn.</DL>
<LD>The sun had barely peeked over the hills of Blue Earth County and
already local cattlemen were bracing for the worst. It was July 31,
2001, and Minnesota was in the middle of its most intense heat wave
in a decade. A radio warning advised farmers to keep livestock out of
the sun. It was too hot even for grazing.</LD>
<LD>   One of those farmers, Jerry Seitzer, started the day by turning on
the sprinklers in his brick-red barn, dousing his cows with hundreds
of gallons of cool water while circulating the air with massive fans.
His philosophy: "You have to treat the cows like you treat yourself."</LD>
<LD>   A few hours later and 10 miles away, in the withering heat of
training camp, the Minnesota Vikings' Korey Stringer was dying.</LD>
<TE>   Stringer, 27, a Pro Bowl offensive tackle, collapsed after the
morning practice on the second day of training camp and died of
heatstroke complications 13 hours later at a nearby hospital. He is
believed to be the only NFL player ever to die of heat illness, and
his widow, Kelci, has filed a $100-million wrongful-death lawsuit
against the Vikings and their medical personnel. Kelci has brought
the suit on behalf of herself and other Stringer heirs, including
their 4-year-old son, Kodie, and Korey's parents. The trial is set
for next summer.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings say they did everything they could to save the
335-pound tackle, who struggled to keep his weight in check
throughout his career. They insist they didn't miss signs that he was
in distress, pointing to a three-month investigation by the Minnesota
Occupational Safety and Health Division clearing the club of any
direct responsibility for Stringer's death. The NFL echoed the Viking
claim that Stringer received "exemplary treatment" and Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue said he is largely satisfied with the way teams
approach training-camp practices and heat-related issues. Teams begin
training camps this month.</TE>
<TE>   Almost four months after Stringer's death, the Vikings disclosed
he had a locker full of controversial and possibly dangerous dietary
supplements on the day he collapsed. The revelation cast doubt on the
notion heatstroke alone killed him.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the Stringers say there is no basis for that theory,
arguing a posthumous toxicology report showed the player's system was
"absolutely clean" and offered no evidence he was taking supplements.
They say the Vikings are guilty of gross negligence and could not
have been more blind, missing all the warning signs and letting
precious minutes slip away as the player's temperature rocketed to
108.8 degrees, possibly higher.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews and depositions indicate Stringer was left alone,
writhing on the ground, while fellow linemen trudged through a
blocking drill, then essentially went untreated in an air-conditioned
trailer for approximately 40 minutes under the watch of an
unregistered, 22-year-old trainer. All this occurred a day after an
overheated Stringer vomited five times, failed to finish the morning
practice and sweated profusely into the night.</TE>
<TE>   "The first day of camp starts a chain of events leading to his
death," said Paul DeMarco, an attorney for the Stringer family. "It's
an unbroken chain from then on."</TE>
<TE>   High heat and humidity made for a heat index of 110 on the day
Stringer collapsed, one of the Upper Midwest's hottest days in a
decade. Stringer attorneys say their weather experts will testify the
day felt between 120 and 130 degrees to the players, who were in full
pads for the first time. Stringer and the rest of the offensive
players wore dark purple jerseys, which made them feel even hotter.
In addition to Stringer, 10 Vikings were treated for heat-related
problems on July 30 and 31, Stringer lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Said DeMarco: "If Korey had been given no more care and attention
than the farmers gave the cows, he'd still be alive."</TE>
<TE>   A Reluctant Witness</TE>
<TE>   Stringer's Viking medical records, obtained by The Times, reveal
the Vikings had treated him for heat-related problems in years past,
even making a special notation a year earlier. Wrote team physician
Dr. David Knowles after treating Stringer for nausea, diarrhea and
severe muscle cramps on July 24, 2000: "I will follow him closely at
training camp."</TE>
<TE>   A year later, at the conclusion of Stringer's final practice, the
only person watching him closely was freelance photographer Billy
Robin McFarland, who was aware Stringer had problems the day before
so he kept an eye on him throughout practice. He noticed Stringer
looked exhausted, disoriented and out of step all morning.</TE>
<TE>   McFarland, 49, is a reluctant and deeply conflicted witness. He
feels very close to the Vikings, whom he has worked with for 20
years. He considers the players his friends--Stringer used to call
him Billy Vanilli--and he has long provided them with flattering
photographs they distribute to fans. The Vikings, in turn, have
treated him well over the years, often letting him fly to away games
on the team's charter, even providing an extra media credential
McFarland used to bring his son onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   McFarland said he barely slept in the weeks after Stringer's death
and considered never showing anyone his pictures of Stringer from
that day. He is haunted by his memories. He has a recurring dream he
saves Stringer by dousing him with a bucket of ice water.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will never forget what he saw on those practice fields,
which sit on the campus of Minnesota State University, Mankato. For
most of the players, practice ended at 11:10 a.m. The offensive
linemen stayed later, though, making their way across the field to
"Big Bertha," a refrigerator-sized heavy bag hanging from a metal
frame. When they got there, they pulled off their helmets and
shoulder pads, dumping them on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, McFarland saw Stringer drop to his knees, fall
over on his right side and curl into a fetal position. All the while
Stringer was clutching his stomach and groaning loudly, McFarland
said. Finally, the player flopped his massive arms over his head. By
the photographer's estimate, Stringer was on the ground for as long
as five minutes, yet did not attract the attention of then-offensive
line coach Mike Tice, who was leaning against the Big Bertha frame
and watching his players strike the bag.</TE>
<TE>   The heat was almost unbearable. "It was like having a whole bunch
of hair dryers blowing on you," McFarland said. "It was stinking
hot."</TE>
<TE>   He was about 10 feet away from Stringer when he snapped a picture
of him sprawled on the ground. Suddenly, the photographer felt a hand
shove his shoulder. It was Pro Bowl center Matt Birk, who had just
hit the bag.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need any pictures of Korey on the ground," said Birk,
sounding annoyed.</TE>
<TE>   McFarland was shaken. "You're right," he said, lowering his camera
and walking across the field, away from the drill.</TE>
<TE>   Recalled McFarland: "I was almost too embarrassed to look up."</TE>
<TE>   A Young Trainer</TE>
<TE>   Moments before McFarland snapped the picture, an offensive lineman
shouted for a trainer to attend to Stringer. The trainer in charge
was Paul Osterman, 22, who was two months out of school and in his
third summer working for the team. He testified he had passed a test
to become a certified athletic trainer at the end of April 2001, but
was not registered until Jan. 12 of this year.</TE>
<TE>   But he was in charge, taking over for head trainer Chuck Barta,
who left the field after practice to treat a cut on the leg of
then-coach Dennis Green. Before leaving, Barta gave Osterman his
cellular phone and the responsibilities that came with it. Barta
instructed him to call Fred Zamberletti, the team's longtime medical
services coordinator, in the athletic training room across the street
"if anything comes up."</TE>
<TE>   It was around 11:20 when Osterman was summoned. He jogged over to
the area where the linemen were hitting Big Bertha and noticed
Stringer lying on his back. "Korey, how are you doing?" he asked.
Stringer didn't respond, instead rising to his feet, walking over to
the heavy bag and taking a rep. Tice and some players say he stumbled
or slipped a bit when he struck Big Bertha. Osterman suggested to
Stringer that he head into the air-conditioned trailer, which was
about 40 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   "It had been a pretty hot day and a pretty long practice and I
thought it would be a good idea, more as a preventive measure, to get
him inside," Osterman testified.</TE>
<TE>   He said Stringer responded by jogging over to the trailer without
saying a word. But attorneys for the family say they have player
testimony that Stringer staggered to the trailer as if he were drunk.
Either way, Stringer and Osterman entered the otherwise empty trailer
around 11:25 and the 62-degree air was so cool it fogged the young
trainer's sunglasses.</TE>
<TE>   The trailer was as much a lounge as it was a first-aid station, a
comfortable oasis for Viking VIPs, including owner Red McCombs and
his family, as well as players. Although it featured two training
tables, it also had cushy office chairs and, hanging on the back
wall, an Edward Hopper print. Water was not immediately available in
the trailer; intern D.J. Kearney brought some in for Stringer, later
testifying there was Gatorade in the trailer's refrigerator. Osterman
testified there was no thermometer to take the player's temperature.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime between 11:25 and 11:30, Osterman advised Stringer he
should drink some water. Stringer took one or two sips, then moved
from a training table to the floor. Osterman said he was letting him
"relax." Ten minutes passed.</TE>
<TE>   Stringer sat up between 11:35 and 11:40 and asked to have his
shoes, socks and ankle tape removed. Osterman needed two minutes to
do so and--in what would be his last words--Stringer thanked him.</TE>
<TE>   Osterman said Stringer was sweating and his skin did not feel
feverish. After drinking a bit more water, the trainer recalled,
Stringer climbed back onto a table and began humming to himself,
bobbing his head to an imaginary beat.</TE>
<TE>   The two had been in the trailer for at least 20 minutes when
Osterman called for a cart to take Stringer to the training room
across the street. He later testified he did so as a matter of
procedure, not because Stringer looked to be in distress. Stringer
got off the table and lay on the floor. He was silent. Osterman tried
to place an ice towel on Stringer's head, but the player pushed it
away.</TE>
<TE>   Five to 10 minutes later, Kearney arrived with the cart. The two
had been in the trailer a half-hour. "Korey, the cart's here,"
Osterman said. "Let's get up." Kearney testified Stringer lifted his
arms and head slightly as if trying to sit up. Osterman remembers him
being "unresponsive," although his eyes were open.</TE>
<TE>   Kearney and Osterman tried to lift Stringer but couldn't budge
him. They had no hope of getting him out of the trailer and down the
small flight of stairs to the cart.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the first sign where, you know, something was wrong and
I was concerned, and that's the first time I checked his vitals,"
Osterman said. "His breathing was normal, and that's the first time I
took his pulse."</TE>
<TE>   Osterman instructed Kearney to get Zamberletti in a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   "I really wasn't sure what was going on at that point," Osterman
said. "I was pretty confused."</TE>
<TE>   Kearney left with the cart, and Osterman checked Stringer's pulse,
which was weak but steady. He didn't count the beats. Kearney
returned with Zamberletti within two minutes. Stringer's breathing
was rapid and shallow, so Zamberletti, in his 41st season with the
Vikings, instructed Kearney to put a zip-lock bag over his face,
concerned about hyperventilation. Kearney held it there for something
less than two minutes, but Stringer kept panting.</TE>
<TE>   Osterman was told to call Knowles, the team physician at training
camp. When he couldn't reach Knowles right away, he called an
ambulance. It was noon, and it was the first time Osterman used the
cellular phone.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Cross ambulance arrived at 12:09, and Stringer was
transported to Immanuel St.-Joseph's Hospital, arriving at 12:24.
When his temperature was taken 11 minutes later, for the first time,
it was 108.8 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Checking the Locker</TE>
<TE>   Osterman, Barta and Zamberletti testified the Vikings provided
trainers with little formal instruction on how to deal with
heat-related problems. The notion Stringer might be suffering from
heat illness did not occur to Zamberletti until after the trainer
arrived at the hospital and heard someone mention heatstroke.
Zamberletti, who testified he has treated approximately 150 cases of
heat-related illness in his career, told attorneys he thought
Stringer had fainted or was having a seizure, possibly because of a
bug bite.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 1, at 1:50 a.m., Stringer was pronounced dead of
heatstroke complications.</TE>
<TE>   The OSHA report, which cleared the Vikings, focuses only on the
workplace environment surrounding the team until 11 a.m., around the
end of formal practice. It contains no analysis or opinion on the
medical attention Stringer received from Viking trainers or doctors.</TE>
<TE>   During the 13 hours when Mankato doctors were scrambling to save
Stringer's life, they called Viking trainers and asked whether the
player had been taking any medication. Team officials talked to his
roommate, guard David Dixon, and sent all the bottles and containers
from his locker to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   In his locker, according to the Vikings, were an empty bottle of
the supplement Ripped Fuel; a vial of Celebrex, an anti-inflammatory
prescription drug; an unopened bottle of the weight-loss product
Xenadrine, and the herbal supplement Mo' Power, a
performance-enhancing product endorsed by teammate Cris Carter.</TE>
<TE>   Xenadrine and a version of Ripped Fuel include derivatives of
ephedra, an herbal stimulant commonly used by athletes and body
builders. According to the Food and Drug Administration, such
over-the-counter products can raise blood pressure, speed heart rate
and contribute to dehydration. At least three of the football players
who died last year--Devaughn Darling of Florida State, Rashidi
Wheeler of Northwestern and Curtis Jones, who played for a Utah
indoor team--were found to have traces of ephedrine in their system
when they died.</TE>
<TE>   A month after Stringer's death, the NFL added ephedrine to its
list of banned substances, following the lead of the NCAA and
International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Stringer reported to training camp at 335 pounds, the lightest
he'd been in six previous seasons as a pro. His agent, James Gould,
said Stringer had been especially careful about what he ate in the
off-season and had no rapid weight loss.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in perfect shape," Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   But when Stringer arrived at the hospital, he might have been
beyond saving. He was essentially comatose, and his organs were in
the process of shutting down.</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back on it now," Knowles said recently in a televised
interview, "all the damage that was done, I don't think we had a
prayer from the start."</TE>
<TE>   Knowles, who works in Mankato full time, is one of the defendants
in the wrongful-death lawsuit and, partly because of that, he has
recently said he wants a reduced role with the team. In the past, he
attended summer practices on request and to make occasional rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL does not require teams to have doctors on duty during
training camp, and, like the Vikings, many teams hire local doctors
to be available for their summer practices.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Gabe Northern, who spent one season with the Vikings
and was cut in training camp last summer, said he had little
confidence in Zamberletti and his staff of trainers. He said they
frequently relied on home remedies when it came to rehabilitating
players, rather than using the conventional methods he saw in his
previous four seasons with Buffalo or in a training-camp stint with
Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like the Beverly Hillbillies," Northern said, referring to
the Viking training staff.</TE>
<TE>   He had nagging hamstring problems, for instance, and requested ice
and electric stimulation for the back of his legs. Instead, he was
told to rapidly kick his legs back and forth. He said it was not
uncommon to see players fresh off knee surgeries pushing a golf cart
with Zamberletti behind the wheel, or to see them carrying
Zamberletti piggyback up and down stairs.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I saw that I called my mom," said Northern, 28, a
former Louisiana State standout. "I said, 'Mom, if they ever make me
do that, I'll retire right away.' That has nothing to do with playing
ball. I couldn't see the help in that."</TE>
<TE>   Northern, and other Viking players who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the team changed some of its policies immediately
after the tragedy. Before Stringer died, for instance, players were
instructed to take only one water or sports drink at the beginning of
camp, then save the bottle and refill it, rather than taking another
one. Beginning the day after Stringer died, water and sports drinks
were offered in abundance, as were iced towels.</TE>
<TE>   "Big K died; we have a lot of Gatorade now," Northern said.
"That's just the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   He said as much when he delivered a eulogy in a memorial service
for Stringer, one of his closest friends on the team. After the
service, Northern said, Barta reminded him the Vikings have always
made drinks readily available to players at training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Northern, who lives in Baton Rouge, La., believes it was more than
a coincidence that he was released a week later and has not been
contacted by an NFL team since.</TE>
<TE>   The Coach's Favorite</TE>
<TE>   The young player was so dehydrated, so wobbly and faint from the
heat, he felt drunk. Had trainers not acted quickly, things might
have been much worse. That player was Mike Tice.</TE>
<TE>   Tice, Stringer's offensive line coach who later would be promoted
to head coach, can remember succumbing to heat illness in 1982, his
second season as an NFL tight end. He was playing for Seattle, and
then-coach Jack Patera didn't believe in making water available to
players. According to sources familiar with his testimony, Tice
recounted the episode in a recent deposition with Stringer attorneys.
He said Patera's no-water policy was "mean," and he said it helped
shape his own coaching philosophy: Treat your players well and they
will perform for you. He has denied calling him a "big baby" when
Stringer struggled during his final practice.</TE>
<TE>   "If you canvassed my players, they would tell you that Korey
Stringer was my favorite," Tice told reporters at the NFL owners
meetings in March. "A lot of people wanted to believe it was Matt
Birk. My players know that it was Korey. I need to be very careful
with what I say because we're in the middle of a lawsuit, but that's
why a lot of the things that have been said have hurt me so bad.</TE>
<TE>   "Because I never, ever in the five years I coached Korey Stringer,
yelled at him. He wasn't the kind of player that took to the yelling.
So the things that I read just kind of tear me apart, to see what's
being said now, what's in this lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at everything, you go through every minute of practice.
You look at it and say, 'What did I miss? What did I not see that I
should have seen?' And there's nothing. I don't want to say I'm at
peace with it because I don't think I'll ever go through a day where
I don't think of it. But at least you have a sense that, 'Thank God,
I didn't miss something.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tice and Stringer were Viking teammates in 1995, often lining up
shoulder to shoulder. Tice remembers him as a young kid teeming with
talent who was enormous and "Cadillac quick." But Stringer wasn't big
on running or training, Tice testified, and frequently would need a
phone call to get him up, out of bed and moving. The two took
frequent walks and, Tice said, Stringer took great pride in his role
as a leader on the offensive line.</TE>
<TE>   So Tice believes Stringer was embarrassed about throwing up five
times on the opening day of practice--once right in the middle of the
huddle--and was mortified the next day to find the St. Paul (Minn.)
Pioneer Press had run a photo of him getting sick. According to
several sources, Stringer was enraged by the photo and, some say,
especially determined to prove himself the next day.</TE>
<TE>   When Stringer was in the trailer, slipping into unconsciousness,
Tice was eating lunch at the team cafeteria, then reading and
relaxing in his dormitory room. It wasn't until the player had been
in the hospital for an hour that Tice received a call from his wife,
informing him of the situation. She had heard about it on a local
sports radio show.</TE>
<TE>   Tice testified he rushed to the hospital, where Viking personnel
and some players were holding vigil. He later told lawyers he was
angry that he wasn't told one of his players was sick.</TE>
<TE>   The person left entirely out of the loop was Kelci Stringer, who
was in Atlanta visiting her parents. Her husband had been in the
hospital more than five hours by the time a friend reached her after
hearing it on the news. Despite the efforts of Viking receiver Randy
Moss, who arranged for a chartered plane for her, Kelci did not
arrive at the hospital until an hour after her husband died. At the
time, she had no idea how bad the situation was.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got there, I asked the hospital communications director,
'Is he OK?' " Kelci recalled. "He just turned around and said, 'Let's
go upstairs.' So I kind of prepared myself--well God prepared me,
rather--and I was walking upstairs to the elevator and I saw some of
his teammates and they were crying. I thought, he has to be in a lot
worse condition than I thought for them to still be crying at this
time of day.</TE>
<TE>   "And I went upstairs and all the coaches were around, and I asked
if he was OK. They told me, 'We lost him.' At that moment, I just
kept saying, 'This is not real. This is not real.' But something else
inside of me kept saying, 'This is real. This is real.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now, almost a year later, the Vikings have made some quiet but
significant changes. Umbrellas were installed on the field for
cooling during mini-camps. Players will report to training camp two
days early and must pass a fitness test, and, for the first time,
there will be a physician on the field at all times during practice.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers in the area are bracing for a summer that could be even
hotter than last year's. Down the road from Jerry Seitzer's farm, his
cousin, Dave, recently installed a new ventilation system for the
cattle in his barn. "We haven't lost any yet," he said, reaching out
to knock on a wooden door frame.</TE>

<HD>No Funeral Services Planned for Williams</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>No funeral services are planned for Ted Williams, his attorney said
Saturday, as a dispute arose over the plans for the remains of the
baseball great.</LD>
<LD>   Williams died Friday in a hospital near his home in Florida. He
was 83.</LD>
<LD>   "Ted Williams was a private person in life, and in death he wished
to remain private," Eric Abel, Williams' attorney, said in a
statement. "He did not wish to have any funeral or funeral services."</LD>
<TE>   Boston Red Sox officials said Saturday they have tentatively
scheduled a memorial celebration on July 22 at Fenway Park, Williams'
home field for 19 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Williams' estranged daughter accused her half
brother, John Henry Williams, of planning to cryogenically freeze
their father's body and preserve his DNA, perhaps to sell in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Later Saturday, Barbara Joyce Williams Ferrell told the Associated
Press that she was told by a "very important person" at Hooper's
Funeral Home in Inverness that her father's body had been moved to
Scottsdale, Ariz., the day before.</TE>
<TE>   "My father's body was put on a plane yesterday with people from
Alcor," Ferrell said, referring to Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a
provider of cryonics services.</TE>
<TE>   "My father's body was picked up yesterday, transported to Ocala
and he was accompanied by a Mr. David Hayes of Alcor to Scottsdale.
All I know is that," Ferrell said. "I'm imagining they were trying to
keep it quiet," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I will rescue my father's body. Me and my attorney are working on
that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams did not return a call Saturday seeking comment
on Ferrell's statements.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Hooper, vice president of the funeral home, said Saturday
he could not comment on whether the body was still at the funeral
home or somewhere else because Williams' family has requested privacy
on the matter.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Alcor said the company would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrell told the Sunday Boston Globe that a restraining order was
to be filed Monday.</TE>

<HD>Armstrong Wins Tour Prologue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE DeSIMONE</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>LUXEMBOURG</DL>
<LD>Lance Armstrong, the defending champion, could have opted to start
Saturday's Tour de France prologue in the leader's yellow jersey.
Like many athletes, however, he prefers clothing that's a little
broken in.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike most athletes, Armstrong has enough talent to win even when
he doesn't mean to.</LD>
<LD>   Armstrong rose up in the saddle on the last gradual grade, pumping
hard but smoothly, and won the 4.3-mile time trial in 9 minutes 8
seconds, two seconds ahead of France's Laurent Jalabert, with an
effort he said left him "cross-eyed."</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know that it's right to start in the yellow jersey,"
Armstrong said. "That's last year. I prefer to look down and see a
team jersey and say to myself, the yellow one is out there and you
have to earn that."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the Tour's quirks, it's not necessarily the best idea to
win this preamble when you have designs on overall victory. Armstrong
and his royal blue-clad U.S. Postal minions are already marked men.
They will have to decide whether to try to keep the jersey or cede it
to a more sprint-oriented team in the initial flat stages, conserving
strength for the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks from other teams will be immediate and furious.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 100% confident in our team, but I don't know that any team
can defend the yellow jersey for three weeks," said Armstrong, who
also won the prologue in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   That victory, in Armstrong's first Tour after recovering from
cancer, was a pleasant surprise. So was Saturday's, he
said--especially after losing time trials to Tour contenders Santiago
Botero and Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano in tune-up races this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Jalabert, last year's top climbing specialist, figuratively doffed
his hat to the Texan.</TE>
<TE>   "As in Formula One, you have to choose the best route and the best
gear," Jalabert said of the all-out sprint. "I did fine, but I forgot
about the blue rocket."</TE>
<TE>   Intermittent rain stopped well before the top riders took their
turns, giving the streets a chance to dry. The riders started one
minute apart, wheeling through the oldest part of the city over
cobblestones, past expensive shop windows and practically close
enough to this financial center's ubiquitous banks to withdraw cash
from the push-button machines.</TE>
<TE>   One absentee, Armstrong's erstwhile chief rival Jan Ullrich, told
reporters Saturday in his native Germany that illicit drugs were
responsible for his positive test for amphetamines last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very naive," said Ullrich, who said he popped two pills
believed to be similar to the party drug Ecstasy because he was
depressed about a recent knee surgery and a drunk-driving incident.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought about it as cheating, because I haven't raced in
a long time....</TE>
<TE>   "What I did was stupid, not cheating. I will not finish my career
on this note."</TE>

<HD>A Surprise Guest at Final Party</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: Unheralded Nalbandian rallies and defeats
Malisse to earn a shot against top-seeded Hewitt on Centre Court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>They say it takes years to come to terms with the grass at Wimbledon,
with players slowly learning the vagaries of the surface during
matches filled with trial and error.</LD>
<LD>   Then there is David Nalbandian.</LD>
<LD>   Conventional wisdom not only has been disproved--how about
obliterated?--by Nalbandian of Argentina, who came to Wimbledon with
no grass-court experience as a professional.</LD>
<TE>   And now, incredibly and inexplicably, he will be playing in the
Wimbledon final today against top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt of Australia.
Nalbandian, a 20-year-old from Cordoba and the most surprising
finalist here since Chris Lewis in 1983, is a match away from joining
Thomas Johansson and Albert Costa as shocking winners in the Grand
Slam tournaments of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot describe this," said Nalbandian, who dropped to his
knees on the court after beating Xavier Malisse in their semifinal,
7-6 (2), 6-4, 1-6, 2-6, 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is the best week of my life. This is very great for
me. For me, this is a dream."</TE>
<TE>   He reached the final by winning the fifth set of his semifinal
Saturday against Malisse of Belgium. Their match was suspended
because of darkness after they played four sets Friday.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth, he fell behind a service break and rallied, breaking
Malisse's serve three consecutive times. "He played well. He probably
kept his nerve just a little better than I did, and that's why he's
going through," Malisse said</TE>
<TE>   Nalbandian eclipsed the Open-era mark of John McEnroe, who lost in
the semifinals in 1977 in his Wimbledon debut and joked about never
having lost here. As a junior, Nalbandian was defaulted from the
semifinals in 1999 for arriving late.</TE>
<TE>   Also, he will be playing on Centre Court for the first time. He
was unruffled by that fact, pointing out before the semifinals he had
been relegated to the secondary courts.</TE>
<TE>   And he didn't plan on stepping on Centre Court on Saturday to get
a feel for it. "It's fine. I don't need it," Nalbandian said.</TE>
<TE>   He is the second Argentine man to reach a Grand Slam final.
Guillermo Vilas won the French Open once, the U.S. Open once and the
Australian Open twice.</TE>
<TE>   This will be the youngest Wimbledon final in Open era history.
Hewitt, who won the U.S. Open in September, turned 21 in February. In
six matches, Hewitt has dropped only two sets, both against Sjeng
Schalken of the Netherlands in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   The last Australian to win Wimbledon was Pat Cash in 1987, and
Hewitt spoke of that after he beat Tim Henman in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what kids dream of, sitting back at home," he said. "It's
what every Australian kid who picks up a tennis racket dreams of, one
day, to be in this situation. For me to have it at the moment, at age
21, it's incredible."</TE>

<LD>Apparently, the ace by Serena Williams to win the first-set
tiebreaker against her older sister Venus in the Wimbledon final
Saturday should have been a let.</LD>
<LD>   The net-cord beeper went off but the noise was drowned out by the
crowd's applause on Centre Court. Chair umpire Jane Harvey called a
let, but the sisters went to their chairs for the changeover. Harvey
was the same official who allowed Elena Dementieva to serve in
consecutive games at the French Open.</LD>
<LD>   Serena had no idea the serve was a let.</LD>
<TE>   "No, no. Thank God, I didn't," she said. "That's just my luck, an
unbelievable serve to be called let."</TE>
<TE>   Much later, Martina Navratilova told her about the let when they
were in the locker room. Serena was asked whether Venus knew.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not telling her," Serena said, laughing.</TE>

<HD>It's Serena Standing Tall</HD>
<DH>Wimbledon: She defeats Venus, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in final as
sisters showcase potential of their budding rivalry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WIMBLEDON, England</DL>
<LD>Graduation Day didn't come at the raucous U.S. Open, the refined
French Open or even the egalitarian Australian Open. It came off at
the stuffiest tennis cathedral of all, Wimbledon. And the Duke of
Kent and Princess Alexandra might as well have been handing out
diplomas, or in this case, shiny hardware.</LD>
<LD>   Venus Williams, 22, and her sister Serena Williams, 20, have
passed almost every test, real or imagined, in a relatively short
span of time. Perhaps the most difficult question was asked and
answered Saturday in the women's final at Wimbledon: Was it possible
for them to play a competitive match against one another?</LD>
<LD>   Yes ... finally.</LD>
<TE>   It took nine matches for two sisters who grew up in Compton to get
it done and mute the criticism about their dominance being a negative
for women's tennis.</TE>
<TE>   Second-seeded Serena defeated No. 1 and two-time defending
champion Venus, 7-6 (4), 6-3, in 1 hour 17 minutes, handing her older
sister her first loss in 21 matches at Wimbledon. Though Venus leads
their series, 5-4, the last three matches have been won by Serena,
all in straight sets.</TE>
<TE>   This was Serena's third Grand Slam title--trailing Venus by
one--and she became the first female player since Steffi Graf in 1996
to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Venus and
Serena have played each other in three Grand Slam finals in the last
10 months, with Serena winning twice.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning of the year, I said, 'I don't care what happens
this year. I want to win Wimbledon,' " Serena said. "And it was an
extra bonus for me to win the French. Sure, I really wanted to win
the French. I just couldn't even believe I won.</TE>
<TE>   "But I just wanted Wimbledon. I wanted to become a member, of so
much prestige, so much history. I want to be part of history."</TE>
<TE>   This match footage probably isn't immediately bound for ESPN
Classic. But it was compelling theater, particularly in the first
set, and it reached a superior level in the tiebreaker. The
shot-making and power was sometimes astounding, and there was
legitimate emotion from both sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to win Wimbledon," Serena said. "It brought out
the best in both of us."</TE>
<TE>   Venus dropped her head after missing shots and appeared on the
verge of tears after losing. Serena angrily bounced her racket after
getting broken at 5-4 when she served for the first set. On break
point, she hit a 105-mph serve and the return came rocketing back,
and Serena netted a backhand. Her racket promptly hit the grass.</TE>
<TE>   When Venus hit a forehand return into the net on Serena's first
match point, Serena dropped her racket in joy but didn't celebrate
excessively after sharing a hug with Venus at the net. She blew
kisses to the crowd and motioned to a ball boy to retrieve the
racket.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two, Serena is more visibly emotional, and Venus appears to
internalize her disappointment. In the last game, serving at 5-3,
Serena was taking big breaths, calming herself, and waiting to
exhale.</TE>
<TE>   In the previous set, Venus had scrambled and survived to pull
herself back after Serena served for it at 5-4, winning eight points
in a row to take a 6-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Serena held to reach the tiebreaker, which featured some of the
best points of the match. Serena hit a 112-mph service winner, a
backhand passing shot down the line, moving forward on the dead run,
and a 100-mph ace on her second set point. For her part, Venus put
down a difficult overhead and later drew a cry of despair from Serena
when she smacked a backhand cross-court passing shot.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, she was just tremendous today," Venus said. "I think that
it wasn't a lot between us. But just on some of those points, she was
getting some that I couldn't get."</TE>
<TE>   Venus looked devastated afterward. She had one ace and six
double-faults, and the average speed of her first serve was 100 mph,
well below last year's standard. The six double-faults were the most
she had in any match here this year. She was troubled by a sore
shoulder and arm, but refused to offer it as an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   Serena knew her older sister was hurting.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially in the second set today I noticed it," Serena said of
the slower serve. "If I'm a competitor, I'm going to have to notice
it. Unfortunately, it's a war out here. If there's a weakness,
someone's going to have to be attacked."</TE>
<TE>   The attitude was a contrast to the Serena of 2001. Last year, she
lost in the quarterfinals here to Jennifer Capriati and seemed to be
the weakest strongest-looking woman, joking that she was a
hypochondriac. Now, a year later, not only have Venus and Serena
distanced themselves from the rest of the players on the tour, Serena
has opened up a sizable gap on her older sister.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I was going for it as much as Serena," Venus said.
"But I don't play the same game as she plays. For her, it's all or
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Said Serena, who has not lost in 19 matches: "I'm happy. I'm part
of the [All England] club.... Yeah, this is going to be my main
hang-out, don't you know?"</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, her clothing and shoe contract with Puma is due
to expire at the end of the year. She was asked if she was worth
"major bank."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I definitely am," she said. "I'm really exciting. I smile a
lot. I win a lot, and I'm really sexy."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the older sister had one more lesson for the younger one on
this commencement day. It was important too. Venus had a chat with
Serena on the court about protocol.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, no one told me that first year that you have to curtsy,"
Venus said. "So I was just running around like a fool.</TE>
<TE>   "I made it a point to tell her that you have to curtsy. I said,
'Did you know?' She said, 'No.' 'Well, you have to curtsy.' "</TE>
<TE>   Sisterhood, after all, has its benefits.</TE>

<DH>Africa: Angola's civil war is over. Now its people are
finding they must be fiercer, and more creative, in fighting AIDS.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LUANDA, Angola</DL>
<LD>A crowd gathers at a dusty outdoor social center in the Morro Bento
neighborhood here to watch as a young man tries to persuade a teenage
prostitute to have sex with him--without using a condom.</LD>
<LD>   The man offers to pay double, arguing that using the contraceptive
will ruin his fun. But the sex worker stands firm, finally convincing
her prospective customer that using a condom properly can actually
enhance his pleasure, because it can prevent his death.</LD>
<LD>   The children and adults who have congregated to watch the
seven-minute skit join in as the couple sing the joys of safe sex.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it is the right way to teach people about HIV and AIDS
because it's easy for people to learn," said Nati Florinda Camoss,
22, who brought her two young daughters along to watch the amateur
theater performance.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what representatives of the Fraternity for
Children, Solidarity and Humanism, an Angolan nongovernmental
organization locally known as FISH, want to hear. The group has been
staging such events throughout this capital since December, targeting
women, young people and prostitutes.</TE>
<TE>   With the recent end to Angola's 27-year civil war, activist groups
say the time is right to launch a full-court press to stop AIDS from
devastating this southwestern African nation.</TE>
<TE>   "In this moment of peace, we are all united, so let's fight this
terrible illness," said Alice Neto, a community activist with FISH.</TE>
<TE>   The war gave Angola all the right ingredients for the epidemic to
thrive. Four million people were driven from their homes, straight
into a migratory life racked by poverty. High unemployment led many
women to sell their bodies. Unruly soldiers and police officers used
their weapons and social influence to command free and typically
unprotected sex, AIDS activists here say.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the cessation of fighting has opened up access to
once-besieged towns and provinces. The fear is that the free flow of
people will enable HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to circulate even
more rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   "The war helped the spread of AIDS, because there were many
people, like the UNITA [rebel] soldiers and their families, who
didn't have access to information," said Osvaldo Colsoul Reinaldo
Melin, president of Humanitarian Action United Angola, a local group
that runs a project called Stop AIDS. "With peace, there is a need to
work even harder to prevent it."</TE>
<TE>   Statistics from the Angolan government put the number of people
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus at about 8,000 out of
a population of 2 million. The United Nations, however, estimates
that more than half a million Angolans live with the virus. This
figure could be even higher, local activists insist, because of the
low rate of reporting cases of HIV infection and Angola's limited
capacity to test for the virus.</TE>
<TE>   And although Angola's infection rate appears to be lower than that
of other southern African nations, where about 20% of adults are
HIV-positive, activists here believe that this country's rate could
easily spiral.</TE>
<TE>   More than 82,000 former guerrillas and 250,000 of their family
members have moved into demobilization camps since the end of the war
in April. UNICEF reportedly plans to inundate the camps with condoms
and information about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases,
and train military health personnel.</TE>
<TE>   Strapped for cash, many local nongovernmental organizations have
been forced to sell condoms rather than give them away, providing a
convenient excuse to many people not to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Ignorance about the disease and ways to prevent it is widespread,
said Antonio Montiero, a coordinator with Population Services
International, a U.S.-funded group that helps local groups with AIDS
prevention initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Montiero explained that common myths about the disease include the
belief that AIDS is a "white man's disease" invented by Europeans to
try to exterminate Africans; that only prostitutes and promiscuous
people can get AIDS; and that condoms make men sterile.</TE>
<TE>   In a survey conducted in Luanda last year by Montiero's group in
coordination with the World Health Organization, 70% said they didn't
believe that condoms were effective in preventing the spread of HIV;
34% said the contraceptive reduced sexual pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Such perceptions have left AIDS awareness groups scrambling to
come up with creative ways to grab attention.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of the Stop AIDS project fan out across the city,
distributing anti-AIDS pamphlets and booklets to taxi drivers,
truckers and passersby. The literature includes photos of some of the
ghastly effects of sexually transmitted diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the pictures shock people," said Melin of the Stop AIDS
project. "But when they see these pictures, they become aware faster
and they start believing faster."</TE>
<TE>   FISH officials use similar scare tactics in graphic films they
show about how to use condoms properly and the impact of living with
the virus.</TE>
<TE>   Many AIDS activists believe that the message is gradually sinking
in, with anecdotal evidence indicating that many people are becoming
more comfortable with talking about the virus.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the film is good," said Feliciana Armando, 27, a sex
worker since 1992. "It has helped me protect myself by showing me how
important it is to use condom so that I don't get infected."</TE>

<HD>Turf Dispute Mars Plan for Bolivia-California Gas Pipeline</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>This impoverished country's best-known export could change from
cocaine to energy in coming years, with California a chief
beneficiary, unless politics and a century-old border dispute get in
the way.</LD>
<LD>   A consortium that includes international energy companies and San
Diego-based Sempra Energy has proposed a $5-billion project to bring
liquid natural gas from deep in the Bolivian jungle to California via
a trans-Andean pipeline, a fleet of huge tankers and a Baja
California terminal and pipeline.</LD>
<LD>   But the pipeline route favored by the energy companies, linking
the consortium's Margarita gas field 200 miles south of here to the
Pacific coast of Chile, has generated intense political opposition
here.</LD>
<TE>   Nationalist critics charge that any such deal would amount to a
surrender of land that Chile seized from Bolivia at the end of the
War of the Pacific in 1883. The territorial dispute has remained a
thorn in their relations. Opponents prefer the pipeline to follow a
northern path to the ocean through Peru.</TE>
<TE>   The energy companies, however, say the additional 125 miles of
pipeline necessary for a northern route would make the project
unfeasible. There would also be higher financing costs associated
with routing the pipeline through Peru, said Ed Miller, general
director of British Gas, one of Sempra's partners here.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no other option than Chile," Miller said in an interview
in Santa Cruz, the center of Bolivia's booming energy industry.</TE>
<TE>   A decision by Bolivian President Jorge Quiroga was expected
shortly after last Sunday's presidential election. But the winner of
that race is still in doubt, as is the congressional coalition that
will wind up choosing a new president Aug. 6. Quiroga may leave the
call to his successor, which would come after Sempra's agreement with
the gas field's producers expires, freeing the consortium to seek gas
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivia is not the only energy-flush country anxious to fill
California's energy deficit. Australia, Indonesia and Russia all have
huge amounts of surplus natural gas they would like to ship to the
state. Three other Baja port-pipeline proposals have been made that
would take in liquid natural gas from those countries and others.</TE>
<TE>   A delay in the pipeline routing decision could cause Bolivia to
lose the race to be part of a gas supply chain to deliver 15% of
California's gas needs, if it forces Sempra into the arms of another
gas supplier. Bolivia's annual share in the proceeds from annual gas
sales to California could be about $600 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra and the other companies pitching the projects, which
include Royal Dutch/Shell, El Paso Corp. and Marathon Petroleum, are
all vying to be the first to start construction on a gas terminal in
Baja. They are waiting only for the Mexican government to finalize
the permit process.</TE>
<TE>   Although four such projects have been proposed, two at most are
expected to be built, with the first one off the mark likely to enjoy
a huge advantage in obtaining financing and accessing the market.</TE>
<TE>   Liquid natural gas has been cooled to minus 160 degrees to reduce
its volume and make it transportable. The liquid is then loaded onto
vast tankers resembling giant thermos bottles and shipped to where
demand is. Upon arrival, the liquid is stored, returned to a gaseous
state and shipped via pipeline to consumers.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal by Sempra, British Gas and other partners includes a
gas terminal to be built about 60 miles down the Baja coastline south
of the U.S.-Mexico border. The seven tankers in this project's fleet
would each be the size of a football field, cost $200 million and
take three years to build.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivia, which privatized its energy industry in 1996, is a major
global storehouse of natural gas. Its 57 trillion cubic feet of
proven gas reserves rank it second only to Venezuela in South
America.</TE>
<TE>   But without markets, the rich reserves in remote locations such as
Bolivia and Russia's Siberia region do the countries little good.</TE>
<TE>   Several natural gas proposals have been made in the wake of
California's energy crisis. More than a quarter of the state's
electricity comes from natural-gas-burning power plants.</TE>
<TE>   The projects are modeled after a successful facility in Trinidad
and Tobago, where immense volumes of gas are shipped via tanker to
U.S. and European ports.</TE>

<HD>San Diego Team Strikes Gold in Bronze-Age Copper Factory</HD>
<DH>History: The 5,000-year- old complex yields trove of
artifacts and a map of society's development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Working in the arid desert of southern Jordan, UC San Diego
archeologists have uncovered a massive 5,000-year-old copper
factory--a Silicon Valley of the Early Bronze Age that helped power
mankind's leap from the Stone Age to more complex, urbanized
societies.</LD>
<LD>   The 70-room complex, on a well-defended mesa about 30 miles south
of the Dead Sea, was dedicated to producing copper ingots, axes,
hammers and other artifacts that are believed to have spread
throughout the Middle and Near East.</LD>
<LD>   Called Khirbat Hamra Ifdan, or KHI, the factory was apparently
destroyed by an earthquake about 2700 BC, a disaster for the owners
and workers but a spectacular opportunity for the UC San Diego team.</LD>
<TE>   The preservation of artifacts is similar to that at the Roman
village of Pompeii, which was destroyed by a volcano in AD 79, said
UC San Diego anthropologist Thomas Levy, who led the expedition with
archeologist Russell Adams.</TE>
<TE>   "We really hit the jackpot here," he said. "We were extremely
lucky to find it as well preserved as it is and not robbed."</TE>
<TE>   The team has already excavated thousands of artifacts from the
site, including crucibles, ingots, copper lumps and slag, copper
tools and more than 1,000 ceramic molds for casting ingots and tools.
By comparison, the largest copper production facility previously
unearthed, at Hisarlik, Turkey--site of the legendary Troy--yielded
fewer than 70.</TE>
<TE>   The scope of the installation has astounded other scientists.</TE>
<TE>   "This tells us that the folks who were living there were
technologically more sophisticated than we had anticipated and
engaging in metallurgy on a scale we hadn't appreciated," said
archeologist Steven Falconer of Arizona State University, who was not
involved in the research. "It shows that the society was more
organized than we thought and trading more widely than we thought."</TE>
<TE>   The factory "is related to the time when the first cities emerged,
the first walled towns, all over the ancient Near East," Levy said.
"Early metallurgy opens a kind of window on how societies evolved."</TE>
<TE>   Archeologists had previously noted a "virtual explosion" in the
availability and use of copper objects from the Early Bronze Age and
onward, a phenomenon often referred to as Metallschock, added Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Such items had previously been associated only with the culturally
elite, as markers of social ranking and personal prestige.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, however, copper items became objects of mass
consumption, available to nearly everyone.</TE>
<TE>   That availability has been viewed--albeit indirectly--as an
indicator of the increased complexity of society, the ability to
mobilize large numbers of people and resources to produce significant
quantities of once rare items--in much the same way Henry Ford's
assembly line brought the once rare and exotic automobile to the
masses.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence from KHI is significant largely because it provides,
for the first time, detailed evidence of this expansion in the
production and use of metals from the perspective of a production
center rather than from the consumer or end-users," said Adams, whose
findings were reported in the June issue of the journal Antiquity.</TE>
<TE>   The site was found by a British road engineer in the early 1970s,
but no excavations were carried out and "nobody had any inkling that
it was very important," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990 and 1992, he did some limited digging there as part of a
broader survey of the region for his doctoral thesis.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in the field when Iraq invaded Kuwait, so it was a short
field season," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he found enough to recognize its potential importance, and he
and Levy organized a larger expedition that has been working at the
site since 1999, in association with researchers from Jordan's
Department of Antiquities and the Deutsche Bergbau-Museum in Bochum,
Germany.</TE>
<TE>   KHI is on a small mesa in a desert region that gets less than 2
inches of rain a year, Levy said. "It's brutally hot most of the
year"--so hot that the team speculates that workers may have occupied
the site only during cooler seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The location on the mesa makes the site easily defended: Only one
pathway to the top exists, and the site's owners built heavy walls
there to block it.</TE>
<TE>   The team has excavated an area of about 1,500 square yards that is
dedicated exclusively to copper production. Using a sophisticated
surveying system based on satellite mapping, the researchers have
been able to plot the progress of copper through the 70 rooms,
courtyards and alleyways of the facility.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the copper was molded into ingots, indicating that an
extensive trade system must have been in place to distribute it
throughout the area.</TE>
<TE>   At the 13 smelting facilities at the site, the team discovered
about 5,000 tons of slag, indicating that the complex produced
several hundred tons of copper over its lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   "This is by far the largest evidence of copper production during
this period," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the team has not found any residential buildings at the
site or any monumental architecture, Levy and Russell are not sure
who built the installation and owned it.</TE>
<TE>   But there are few signs of external influence in the factory, so
it was most likely indigenous people, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally speaking, the basic ethnic stock was loosely associated
with the Canaanites of the Old Testament," Falconer said. "But we
would have to imagine that these communities would have had lots of
different people of different ethnicities."</TE>
<TE>   Whoever was in charge, "the architecture of the settlement was
very well planned, with small alleyways and very well defined storage
complexes," Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, many different technologies had to come together for
the copper production, including shaft mining, new smelting
techniques and charcoal production methods. Charcoal analysis at the
site indicates that local fuel had grown scarce, Adams said, and wood
had to be imported from long distances.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, other technologies were being developed in the
region, he said. That included large-scale building projects,
extensive changes in agriculture patterns, development of an olive
oil industry and the planting of vineyards and the production of
wine.</TE>
<TE>   "There were lots of things going on that reflect mustering human
resources toward a longer-term end," Adams said. added.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a part of the world that provides Western society with a
lot of our cultural background," Falconer said. "It's important to
know how they developed their ways of life that ultimately influenced
ours so thoroughly."</TE>

<HD>Zionist Dreams Sinking Into Despair</HD>
<DH>Mideast: U.S.-born Israelis revise their belief in a
peaceful yet democratic state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Tina Silverman walks past the boutiques and cafes on Rothschild
Boulevard in Tel Aviv and, for a moment, sees Israel as it was
supposed to be. Mothers push their kids in strollers, grandparents
nibble on ice cream, teens linger over cappuccino. Safe in their
country.</LD>
<LD>   But, she realizes, they're not safe.</LD>
<LD>   Janet Aviad recaptures her life's work in a fleeting splash of
activism each Saturday night when she joins a peace demonstration
outside the Jerusalem residence of the Israeli prime minister. But
crowds are small, and those who do show up, Aviad says, are depressed
"to the point of despair."</LD>
<TE>   Twenty-one months of debilitating warfare with the Palestinians,
of suicide bombings and political stagnation and crippled economics,
have had profound effects on Israeli society. Especially for Israelis
such as Silverman and Aviad, who once believed peace and a normal
relationship with the Palestinians to be possible, fundamental
questions about the future and evolving character of the Jewish state
wrench the gut and eat at the soul.</TE>
<TE>   They came to Israel from America many years ago to further the
Zionist cause, the building of a Jewish state that would be tolerant,
secure and democratic. Instead, they see today a scared, hardened
nation awash in hatreds, with space for dissent shrinking and many
people, especially among younger generations, fleeing instead of
arriving--in direct contradiction to the spirit of Zionism.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five years after what Israelis saw as a glorious victory in
the Middle East War, and as Israel has turned the clock back on the
Oslo peace accords and reoccupied the West Bank, many now feel doomed
to a life of eternal conflict. They feel trapped by the collapse of
even a semblance of a peace process, the seemingly unabated rise in
Palestinian attacks and fury, and the lack of
leadership--anywhere--to change things.</TE>
<TE>   For Janet Aviad, one of the founders of the activist group Peace
Now, the hopes she had for a democratic and tranquil Israel are
evaporating. And Tina Silverman, a magazine art director, has all but
given up on the Zionist dream that brought her to Israel nearly two
decades ago. The two women encapsulate the palpable sense of
despondency that permeates Israel today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aviad, a petite woman of 59, was sitting in her living room the
other day in Jerusalem's tony German Colony neighborhood with her
32-year-old son, Mikie. He had just finished another tour of military
reserve duty that included, among other tasks, occupying the biblical
West Bank city of Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   Aviad and her son's politics once meshed absolutely. He
occasionally accompanied her to peace rallies. But he is bitter now,
any tolerance he once felt toward his Palestinian neighbors wiped out
by the past months of violence.</TE>
<TE>   The mother recoils at some of her son's harsher comments. But she
also finds herself repeatedly conceding points to him.</TE>
<TE>   "We lied to ourselves for years," Mikie Aviad said. The left and
much of Israel's so-called peace camp ignored extremism on the
Palestinian side, the pace at which Palestinians were amassing guns
and the continued anti-Jewish rhetoric, he said.</TE>
<TE>   His mother essentially agrees. Many in the Israeli left felt
betrayed when Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat walked
away from peace talks at Camp David in the summer of 2000, then
supported an armed uprising against Israeli occupation. Like those on
the right, many leftists no longer trust Arafat--and wonder how they
could have been so wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "We all blinded ourselves," she said. "All of us are sobered up
now."</TE>
<TE>   Force is the answer, Mikie says. He believes what he did in
Bethlehem was necessary and right. The army invaded Bethlehem, and
most of the rest of the West Bank, as part of a five-week offensive
this year with the stated aim of wiping out terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "We went in a house, took the family, put them downstairs and
slept in the house two days," Mikie recalled. "I have no problem with
it. I have no problem using them to protect myself. That's exactly
what we did. We didn't kick them out--we [kept] them there so no one
would blow us up. I have no problem with it whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to use Palestinian civilians as targets, but if some
get hurt while we're doing what we're doing, then that's how it has
to be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His attitude has been shaped by the suicide bombings, by the fear
and anger that have gripped the nation. More than 2,000 people,
Palestinians and Israelis, have been killed since September 2000, and
in recent months the number of Israeli dead in certain periods has
outpaced the number of Palestinian dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel they are a bunch of barbarians," Mikie Aviad said,
adding that his preferred solution is to build a fence between the
two peoples--an idea fast becoming reality. "I don't want Arab
friends.... I don't want to see Arabs, I admit it."</TE>
<TE>   It must hurt Janet Aviad, a longtime champion of coexistence who
to this day continues to attempt meetings with Palestinians, to hear
her son say such things. She grimaced ever so slightly and stared at
the tiled floor of her meticulously refurbished 1930s home.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little sorry about it," she said. "I know he's angry--at
the use of terror, the violence, the betrayal. I'm angry, but I don't
have the same desire not to see. But many, many people have given up
on the idea of peace right now.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not 'peace now,' it's 'border now.' Stop the occupation, get
out, build a fence, they're there, we're here. Then, after a while,
when the [violence] is forgotten and the graves are cold, then we
might go back to a certain kind of normalization."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tina Silverman goes to work in Jerusalem three days a week but
vastly prefers Tel Aviv. The coastal city, despite suffering its
share of suicide bombings and other attacks, maintains more of a
semblance of normality than does Jerusalem. It is still a party town,
with restaurants and cafes that endure in spite of it all.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Simmy Reguer, also endure in spite of it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a day has gone by that I haven't cried about it,"
she said. "You can't help it.</TE>
<TE>   "You go to a funeral of somebody [killed in a terror bombing], and
they're burying a leg. You don't just brush that aside. Oh, everybody
goes on with their lives.... But it's tough. You really go up and
down, up and down. Every single time."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman and Reguer, a television sports announcer, once
considered themselves to be leftists. But both have had a change of
heart, his more drastic than hers.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't used to believe we should go and blow people out. Now I
believe we should go in and blow people out. That's a very big
difference," said Reguer, a gregarious man of 56. "We're getting
bombed--we should bomb them. Plain and simple. No turning the other
cheek. Those days are over."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman, 52, doesn't like to hear it put quite that way. But she
too says the brutal reality has hardened the choices.</TE>
<TE>   "We came to Israel to build a state so that the word 'victim'
wouldn't be part of our vocabulary. It strikes at a very deep chord,"
she said. "Unfortunately, the primal response is not very pretty. It
means going into Jenin. It means checkpoints. It means all these
things that are not very pretty."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman and Reguer live in a third-floor apartment among small
buildings on one of Tel Aviv's sunny side streets. For both, this is
their second marriage. Their comfortable home is peppered with family
photos and original art; in one corner of the living room is a huge
television, testament to Reguer's work as a broadcaster. He also runs
a sports camp for children, but it was hard to get people to sign up
this year.</TE>
<TE>   The Aviads, Silverman and Reguer--all American-born
Israelis--support, in varying degrees, their army's actions. They
worry not about Israel's survival but about the quality of the state
that is developing. They have come to realize that their Zionist
vision will not be realized, at least not in the way they conceived.
Expectations are being lowered, redefined.</TE>
<TE>   By circumstance more than by design, all but one of Silverman and
Reguer's four children have chosen to live in a country other than
Israel. In some respects, many Israeli children have outgrown a small
country hemmed in by war and have left, bucking a long trend of
immigration to the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   "The days of when Israeli kids stayed in Israel are" over,
Silverman said. Her older daughter is working in Spain; her younger,
Israeli-born daughter has stayed in Tel Aviv. Reguer's two sons are
on the U.S. East Coast, one studying filmmaking and the other working
in a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to think of yeridah, of leaving Israel, as something that
was really a social no-no. You were ashamed of it," she said. "Now
everyone talks about their kids, 'This one's in London, this one's
there,' and no one's embarrassed anymore. We're grateful that they're
doing well economically, we know they can't make it here. It's
impossible for these children to support themselves here. We're glad
that they're safe, we're glad that they're enjoying their lives, and
we're not ashamed."</TE>
<TE>   Not ashamed, but not delighted either. The desertion of younger
generations speaks to the failure of Zionism, Silverman said.</TE>
<TE>   "For Zionists like myself, it's extremely painful," she said. "It
means what I thought was going to be a rebirth of not only Jewish
culture but Israeli culture is now being disseminated throughout the
world, and none of it is staying here because we cannot give our kids
what we thought we could give them. It's been beaten away by war.
It's a country that's been at war for 53 years."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman and Reguer came to Israel in different years, but in
times of promise and change. She became an Israeli citizen in 1984
after making many visits to the country, milking cows on a kibbutz
and filling in for young farmers who fought the Yom Kippur War in
1973.</TE>
<TE>   He arrived 35 years ago at one of the country's most critical
junctures, four months after Israel captured east Jerusalem, the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war. Those were heady days of
personal and collective empowerment, when Israel was realizing the
extent of its military self-reliance.</TE>
<TE>   It would also be the start of decades of occupation, something
Silverman and Reguer see as a historic mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Silverman struggles emotionally with whether to stay,
though she can't imagine leaving. Reguer is firm about remaining
against all odds and in the face of the violence. That is his Zionist
duty, he said, proof that Zionism has not failed.</TE>
<TE>   "If Zionism would have failed, we'd be gone already," he said.
"Take a look at the ugly picture of what's going on here, of people
walking into supermarkets and blowing themselves up. If you weren't a
true Zionist, you'd pack your things and get on a plane and be gone."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman countered, "I think Israel is kind of like New York in a
way, that old feeling where you think that anything is possible. I
used to get that feeling here. I don't get that feeling here anymore.
That's why I think Zionism has failed."</TE>
<TE>   Janet and Mikie Aviad think that Israel's 35-year occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip has corrupted the nation. Zionism might
not have failed, they said, but it is in trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Very basic questions have to be re-answered, things that we
thought were very obvious about the nature of our society and the
Jewish people," Mikie Aviad said. "Everything has been shaken up here
to the point where we have to ask everything."</TE>
<TE>   Why, he asks, do polls show support for undemocratic measures such
as limiting the civil rights of Arab citizens of Israel and even the
expulsion of Arabs? Why are extremists, the right, a minority of
Jewish settlers and the ultra-Orthodox so often allowed to shape and
propel the national agenda?</TE>
<TE>   Janet Aviad believes that the goal of Zionism, to establish a
Jewish state, succeeded beautifully. It is the history since 1967,
she said, that has tainted Zionism and made its existing form
something other than what she envisioned. Whether the liberal,
democratic Zionism she favors will still shape Israeli society is,
she said, an open question.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an earthquake in Israel, and a lot of buildings have
collapsed," she said. "They have to be, they can be, rebuilt. I
think."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mikie, who came to Israel with his mother when he was 3, now has
his own son, 18 months. He contemplates leaving. And he is so worried
about the kinds of things being taught in Israeli schools right now
that he only half-jokingly said he is considering sending his child
to a local Catholic school.</TE>
<TE>   The state of affairs was driven home to him by a care package that
he and his troops received from Israeli sixth-graders. In addition to
the cookies and fruit, it contained a neatly lettered sign, "Death to
the Arabs." He thinks that the teacher probably wrote it because the
handwriting was so clear.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people my age ... want what everyone else our age
wants. They want to be able to raise their children in a good way,
they want to have enough money to live well and they want to have a
good, interesting job," he said. "None of these things are available
in Israel, and they don't seem that they're going to be available in
the near future."</TE>
<TE>   For the Aviads, and for Silverman and Reguer, this is an
about-face in expectations that has taken place in just the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take it as a whole, the weight of it leaves no hope. It
represents no exit," Janet Aviad said.</TE>
<TE>   "What kills me," Reguer said, "even though this is selfish what
I'm saying, these are the years that stuff should be coming back.
I've worked 35, 40 years."</TE>
<TE>   "You fight depression [that comes from] fear and death, but you
also fight the depression that you have to get used to it. And that
you have to get used to it for the rest of your life because this is
the way we are going to live our lives," Silverman said.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually do think that's true. Maybe my grandchildren will be
able to live in a society that's peaceful. But I really do,
unfortunately, think that this is going to be it for the next 100
years."</TE>

<HD>Assassins Kill Afghan Official</HD>
<DH>Asia: Vice president, an ethnic Pushtun, is the second
government minister slain. He had a controversial past and many
enemies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TARIN KOWT, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A pair of gunmen assassinated Afghan Vice President Haji Abdul Qadir
in broad daylight Saturday as he drove away from his office in the
capital--a crime that clearly destabilized this nation's fledgling
democracy.</LD>
<LD>   Qadir was the most prominent ethnic Pushtun in the government of
newly installed President Hamid Karzai, apart from Karzai. Qadir's
appointment was considered crucial to appeasing the demand of his
fellow Pushtuns for a voice in the government, which is dominated by
ethnic Tajiks.</LD>
<LD>   This was the second assassination of a government minister in less
than five months. Air Transportation and Tourism Minister Abdul
Rahman, who was killed under still-unexplained circumstances Feb. 14
at the airport in the capital, Kabul, also was a Pushtun. But Qadir's
slaying marked the first such violent incident since Karzai's
18-month transitional government was sworn in 2 1/2 weeks ago.</LD>
<TE>   In Kennebunkport, Maine, where he is spending the Fourth of July
weekend, President Bush said the assassination left the United States
"more resolved than ever to bring stability to the country, so the
Afghan people can have peace and hope."</TE>
<TE>   He said that Qadir "desired freedom and stability for the country
he loved" and that a national security official had expressed
condolences to Karzai and the government and people of Afghanistan,
"who lost a good and valued friend."</TE>
<TE>   The slaying occurred about 12:30 p.m. local time, according to the
BBC's Pashto-language radio service. Police and witnesses said
Qadir's four-wheel-drive Toyota Land Cruiser crashed into a wall as
bullets riddled the side and windshield, killing both the vice
president and his driver. A bodyguard was injured.</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai rushed to the hospital where Qadir's body was taken and
then summoned his Cabinet to an emergency session. He set up a
five-member delegation to investigate the killing. No group claimed
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the United States would offer investigative
assistance to Afghanistan to determine responsibility for Qadir's
death, Bush said: "Right now, the Afghan government believes they can
handle the investigation. There's all kinds of scenarios as to ...
who killed him. But we'll work closely with the government if they
want us to."</TE>
<TE>   He said that terrorists could be responsible, but "it could be
drug lords, it could be longtime rivals. Who knows?</TE>
<TE>   "All we know," he said, "a good man is dead, and we mourn his
loss."</TE>
<TE>   However, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Omar Samad called the
killing a "terrorist action" carried out by "enemies of the state who
are against peace in the country."</TE>
<TE>   Qadir was one of Karzai's five vice presidents and was also the
minister for public works. His decision to join the new government
was considered a victory for Karzai in his effort to bring warlords
with strong regional bases into the Kabul administration as part of a
strategy for unifying the country.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime moujahedeen commander, Qadir was one of the few ethnic
Pushtuns to join with the Tajik-dominated Northern Alliance in its
fight against the hard-line Taliban regime, which toppled last fall.
His family in recent years has staunchly opposed the Taliban, and his
brother Abdul Haq was executed by the Taliban last year when he was
captured after entering the country secretly to organize a Pushtun
rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   Qadir's death underscored the fragility of the new government and
the difficulties facing Karzai as he attempts to stabilize this
country after 23 years of war. Afghanistan is as much a collection of
provinces, each with its own powerful commander, as it is a unified
nation, and now that a centralized government is taking shape,
intense rivalries are becoming deadly.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Qadir survived a bomb attack aimed at Defense Minister
Mohammed Qassim Fahim, a Tajik, as he accompanied Fahim on a visit to
the eastern city of Jalalabad. The attack was widely viewed as a
Pushtun protest against Tajik domination in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   In the capital Saturday, conjecture about the identity of the
assassins ranged from fellow Pushtuns with old grudges to
drug-dealing competitors and rivals who want more power in eastern
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Qadir, a tall man with a trim white beard, had a controversial
past and many enemies. An articulate and intelligent figure who spoke
English and was tremendously popular in his home base of Jalalabad,
he was a significant player in almost every chapter of Afghanistan's
recent history.</TE>
<TE>   Born into a prominent and influential family in Jalalabad, he was
one of the most prominent of the guerrilla commanders during the
1980s war against the Soviet occupation. When that regime ended, he
became a successful businessman. His family owned an airline in the
1990s that it used to import goods from Dubai and sell in Pakistan,
which borders his home province.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, he became governor of Nangarhar province, before
the Taliban took power, and welcomed suspected terrorist Osama bin
Laden when he arrived in Jalalabad with a number of Arab followers
from Sudan. Although there is no reason to think that Qadir supported
Bin Laden's political views, he allowed the terrorist leader to use
cave complexes that later became Al Qaeda bases.</TE>
<TE>   As governor of Nangarhar from 1992 until 1996, Qadir was often
criticized by the United Nations drug control program for not doing
enough to curb poppy production in the province, one of the largest
poppy-producing regions of the country. Poppies are used to make
opium and heroin. More recently, he talked about his efforts to
persuade Nangarhar farmers to stop planting poppies, but he appears
to have allowed them to harvest this year's crop.</TE>
<TE>   Qadir had an intense rivalry with another commander in eastern
Afghanistan, Haji Mohammed Zaman, whose forces were allied with the
United States in its December assault on Tora Bora, the mountain cave
complex in the eastern province of Nangarhar where Bin Laden was
thought to have been hiding. Zaman lost out when Qadir was
reappointed governor of Nangarhar after the fall of the Taliban, but
with Qadir's move to the capital as vice president, it appeared
likely that Zaman might use his absence as an opportunity to augment
his power in Jalalabad.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate development Saturday, U.S. military authorities
acknowledged for the first time that Afghan civilians were killed in
U.S. bombing raids Monday in the eastern province of Oruzgan.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference in Kabul, Army Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill,
commander of U.S. forces in the country, said a preliminary
U.S.-Afghan inquiry into the incident had determined that there were
civilian deaths and injuries in the attack, which struck several
hamlets in the province.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said a formal investigation would be conducted to unearth
more details and to determine whether U.S. forces should change their
method of operations in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Afghans, including Karzai, have complained publicly about the
raid, which allegedly killed a large number of Afghans attending a
wedding ceremony at Kakarak. Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah, who
appeared at the news conference with McNeill, said that by the latest
count, 48 people were killed and 117 wounded in the raid.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said the preliminary investigation indicated that there
were several reports from sources on the ground and in the air
suggesting that U.S. aircraft had been targeted by antiaircraft fire
at the time of the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators found some shrapnel and shell casings near the
attack site, but they did not find an antiaircraft gun, he said.</TE>
<TE>   McNeill said U.S. investigators had not been able to examine any
of the dead, who had already been buried.</TE>
<TE>   Though the incident has caused strains in the alliance, McNeill
and Abdullah sought to emphasize their intent to forge ahead and put
the incident behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important that we keep this coalition together and properly
oriented," McNeill said. "We are guests, and they are our allies."</TE>

<HD>Drug Resistance Complicates HIV Therapy</HD>
<DH>Health: Another study, ahead of a conference on the
epidemic, finds such infections can be safely treated in those who
also have hepatitis C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>At least one in every four San Franciscans newly infected with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, contracts a form that is resistant to one
or more of the commonly used AIDS drugs, researchers said here
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   As a result of this resistance, it takes at least three times as
long to bring these infections under control, and more complicated
drug regimens are often required, said Dr. Frederick M. Hecht of UC
San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Hecht's remarks came on the eve of the 14th International AIDS
Conference, which opens in this Mediterranean port city today. The
findings are particularly alarming with respect to HIV treatment in
developing countries, because the greatest increase in resistance was
observed for the drugs that are least expensive--and thus more likely
to be widely used in the Third World, other experts said.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate study, Baltimore researchers found that, contrary to
the belief of many physicians, HIV infections can be safely treated
in people who are also infected with the hepatitis C virus.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists had thought that the AIDS drugs would exacerbate
liver problems caused by the hepatitis, but that was not the case,
Dr. Richard E. Chaisson of the Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine said. In fact, the hepatitis victims in the Baltimore study
who were not treated for HIV developed AIDS and died sooner than
those who were treated.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all HIV-positive people should receive anti-AIDS drugs,
even if they are also infected with the hepatitis C virus, Chaisson
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Both sets of findings appear in the July 10 Journal of the
American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco is an ideal place to study transmission of resistant
strains of HIV because many AIDS drugs receive their first trials
there, antiviral therapy is widely used, and increases in high-risk
behavior among its young male homosexuals have meant greater AIDS
transmission, Hecht said. Trends that appear in San Francisco are
likely to appear elsewhere a few months or years later.</TE>
<TE>   Hecht, Dr. Robert Grant and their colleagues studied 225 newly
infected patients--none of whom had yet received treatment--between
1995 and 2001, using at least two different tests to determine drug
resistance. Their criteria were quite stringent, requiring that a
resistant virus tolerate 10 times the normal dose of a drug.</TE>
<TE>   They found that about 25% of the patients had a virus resistant to
reverse transcriptase inhibitors--the first and most widely used
class of AIDS drugs--in 1996 but that the incidence of resistance had
dropped to 7% in 1998-99, probably because of the increasing use of
other drugs during the period. By 2001, however, the rate of
resistance in this class resurged, to 21%.</TE>
<TE>   Equally alarming was the growth of resistance to the
non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a new and potent
class of drugs. The team found no resistance to the drugs in 1996,
when they had just been introduced. But resistance levels grew to 6%
in 1998-99 and 13% in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   These two classes are the most likely to be used in developing
countries because they are the cheapest.</TE>
<TE>   For the final class of drugs, protease inhibitors, the resistance
rate was 3% at the beginning of the study, 5% in 1998-99 and 7% in
2001. Hecht speculates that either the drugs in this class impair
transmission or the resistant virus is somehow less viable.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of patients with resistance to more than one drug
had climbed to 13% by 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, only one of the 225 subjects was resistant to all
three classes of drugs," Hecht said.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, 27.4% of the patients in 2001 had a virus resistant to at
least one drug.</TE>
<TE>   The patients with resistant viruses could receive effective
treatment, but it was more difficult, Hecht said. For those without
resistant viruses, four weeks of treatment were required to reduce
the virus to undetectable levels in the blood. For those with a
resistant virus, 12 weeks were required.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also expect the incidence of resistance to
continue to grow in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "The question," Hecht said, "is whether it will eventually plateau
or keep growing."</TE>
<TE>   The take-home message, he concluded, is that people who engage in
high-risk behaviors are now putting themselves in a position to
contract a form of disease that is increasingly difficult to treat.</TE>
<TE>   Hepatitis C infections are a major problem among the HIV-positive
because the two viruses are spread in the same way: by intravenous
drug abuse and unsafe sex. In the United States and Europe, one in
every three HIV-infected people is also infected with hepatitis C,
according to Dr. Glen R. Hanson, acting director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse. In some cities, more than half of
HIV-infected people are co-infected.</TE>
<TE>   But what to do about this has remained problematic. Some small
studies had suggested that the AIDS drugs accelerated the pace of
liver disease. A majority of those with both viruses, furthermore,
are injection drug users, and some clinicians doubted that they would
adhere to treatment regimens. As a consequence, many patients have
gone untreated.</TE>
<TE>   Chaisson, Dr. Mark Sulkowski and their colleagues studied 1,995
HIV-positive patients who visited HIV clinics at Hopkins between 1995
and 2001. None had AIDS, but 45% were co-infected with hepatitis C.
The patients were treated by other doctors in the routine course of
business. The team merely monitored the outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   The team found that those with the hepatitis C virus responded as
well to AIDS therapy as did those without the virus. The Hopkins
clinicians gave AIDS drugs to 69% of those who were not infected by
the hepatitis C virus and to 54% of those who were. And those who did
not receive the drugs progressed to AIDS and died sooner.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, Chaisson said, is that physicians should treat
patients who are co-infected in the same manner they would those who
do not have hepatitis C.</TE>
<TE>   But he and others cautioned that treatment of hepatitis C
simultaneously with AIDS treatment can, in fact, cause serious liver
problems. If physicians intend to treat the hepatitis, they should do
it before beginning AIDS therapy.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Business Model a Tough Sell Overseas</HD>
<DH>Scandals: Many foreign markets are rethinking the idea of
America as fiscal standard-setter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN IRITANI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carolyn Brancato was supposed to advise the top officials of the
oil-rich sultanate of Oman on how to clean up their stock market.
Instead she found herself fielding offers of condolence.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone was dressed in their robes and talking about Enron and I
thought to myself, wait a minute, I'm in the wrong movie," said
Brancato, director of the Global Corporate Governance Research Center
at the New York-based Conference Board, a business think tank. "These
other countries have had to prove that their capital markets are good
and honest and we've taken it for granted in the U.S. Unfortunately
we now have to prove it ourselves."</LD>
<LD>   Corporate America's fall from grace has been swift and brutal, but
it has been particularly humbling for people like Brancato, on the
front lines of a campaign to convince foreigners that the quickest
path to fiscal righteousness was replicating the U.S. model of
corporate openness, independent directors and outside auditors. Those
efforts are increasingly running into roadblocks as corporate
improprieties pile up like a freeway collision and spooked foreigners
pull their wealth out of U.S. markets.</LD>
<TE>   Around the world, the architects of the global economy are
rethinking the idea that the U.S. should be the undisputed
standard-setter for everything from executive compensation to
accounting. They point to the problems of Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc.
and Xerox Corp. as the dark side of a Western-style capitalist system
that rewarded greed and short-term gain and turned high-flying chief
executives into celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been a student of capital markets for 40 years and an
individual investor for almost as long, and in that period I have
never seen the collapse of faith in American corporations that I see
today," said Linda Tsao Yang, the former U.S. ambassador to the Asian
Development Bank and an organizer of the Asia Corporate Governance
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I still believe the American model works, but I have to work much
harder to persuade others in Asia to share my faith."</TE>
<TE>   The cries of hypocrisy are particularly loud across the Pacific
Ocean, where the 1997 Asian economic meltdown inspired U.S. officials
to preach on the need to stamp out crony capitalism and tighten up
regulation of their markets.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some Japanese that are taking delight in this, saying
that the U.S. really doesn't have a very good system despite the U.S.
trying to proselytize and tell others they should adopt the U.S.
system," said Glen Fukushima, a former U.S. trade official and
president of Cadence Design Systems Japan, a software firm.</TE>
<TE>   Dogged by accusations of ethics violations tied to a Texas energy
venture, President Bush has promised to address America's sinking
credibility in a speech Tuesday on Wall Street. Corporate governance
supporters argue the U.S. still has the toughest corporate ethics
requirements and market regulations in the world and it is the
failure of individuals--not the system--that is at the root of the
latest wave of Wall Street scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Investors still know more about U.S.-listed companies than those
trading abroad. But with the world's stock markets in a freefall and
the dollar losing 8% of its value in the last quarter, America is
under pressure to move quickly to prove to the rest of the world that
corporate governance is more than an empty slogan.</TE>
<TE>   "No one believes anyone right now," said Erik Berglof, a fellow at
the European Corporate Government Institute based in London and
Brussels.</TE>
<TE>   "A fundamental lesson of this is that the repercussions of one
company making errors or misjudgments are tremendous. It affects the
whole image of stock markets not just in the United States but goes
much more broadly."</TE>
<TE>   Berglof believes that there are basic rules of good corporate
behavior that are universal, such as the need for better reporting
and accountability to shareholders and independent oversight. But he
also argues that key differences in culture and corporate ownership
structures were overlooked during the rush to emulate the global
superpower in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., which boasts the world's most developed capital
markets, publicly held companies dominate the Fortune 500. But
outside the U.S. and England, the vast majority of companies have
controlling shareholders, often families that tend to vote as a bloc.
The government also owns major stakes of leading firms in many
countries.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, U.S. institutional investors and officials sought
to reduce the power of controlling shareholders, arguing that they
were unresponsive to minority concerns. But such important
shareholders can play a positive role if they wield their power
wisely, according to Berglof.</TE>
<TE>   Though firms controlled by families are notoriously close-mouthed
and resistant to outside criticism, they face greater social pressure
to protect their reputation than chief executives who owe their jobs
to corporate boards.</TE>
<TE>   In the riches-to-rags tale of France's Vivendi Universal, it was
the Bronfman family that orchestrated the ouster of embattled
Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier last week after the
water company-turned-entertainment giant lost $41 billion this year.
The Bronfman family controls 5% of the company, making them the
largest shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   This year, for example, angry shareholders of Swiss-based ABB
Ltd., one of the world's largest engineering firms, forced former CEO
Percy Barnevik to give up more than half of the $120-million pension
he had awarded himself. They also replaced most of the board of
directors. Swiss authorities have launched a criminal investigation
into the scandal involving the charismatic Barnevik, known as
Europe's Jack Welch, the GE icon. His defense was that he had given
himself an "American payment system in a European environment."</TE>
<TE>   "In this case, the controlling shareholders were quite useful
because they forced this payback, which benefited all the
shareholders," Berglof said.</TE>
<TE>   Many fear that the latest scandals will be used as an excuse to
scuttle badly needed reforms in places like Asia, where governments
eager to lure back foreign investment have tightened up regulation of
their capital markets. Those include requirements for the appointment
of independent directors, auditing committees and improved financial
reporting.</TE>
<TE>   Amar Gill, who recently conducted a corporate governance survey
for Hong Kong-based CLSA, an emerging market consulting firm, said
America's woes are a reminder that corporate governance involves more
than "creating a set of boxes to check off." Though many large Asian
companies have begun appointing independent board members, they are
often friends of key management. Audit committees lack the knowledge
of "forensic accounting" to detect problems, according to Gill,
CLSA's research director.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest improvements have come in countries such as South
Korea, where influential foreign investors and outspoken academics
have successfully forced companies to open their books, expose
cross-dealings among related companies and accept independent board
members. Unhappy shareholders also have begun filing civil suits
there and in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get that much shareholder activism from big global
institutions," Gill said. "You need activists on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   David Webb, one of Hong Kong's most vocal critics of corporate
abuse, said Asian business leaders are using the problems of Enron
and WorldCom to backslide on tougher market regulations. He cited the
case of HSBC Holdings, which has opposed a proposal by Hong Kong
regulators to require quarterly reporting. The bank argues that it
would create undue pressure to emphasize profitability over long-term
goals.</TE>
<TE>   "Defenders of the status quo, who are always dragging their feet
on reform, now point to America and say, 'They're no better than we
are, let's all be bad together,' " said the editor of webb-site.com,
a Hong Kong based corporate governance Internet site.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. clearly has lost ground in the skirmish over a global
accounting standard, designed to lessen the headaches for
multinational firms and make it easier for stock market regulators to
monitor corporate performance across borders.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. had been pushing the Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, or GAAP, issued by the Norwalk, Conn.-based Financial
Accounting Standards Board. U.S. officials argued that the GAAP
standards reduced the opportunities for mistakes or fraud by closely
detailing how companies should handle specific accounting issues. But
Europeans prefer the broader accounting principles set by the
London-based International Accounting Standards Board, which will
become mandatory in 2005 for companies in the European Union.</TE>
<TE>   "The compound effect of Enron and now WorldCom has people starting
to question the value of the U.S. systems in general," said Bryce
Corbett, a spokesman for the International Chamber of Commerce in
Paris. "The European standard is starting to look quite effective in
comparison."</TE>
<TE>   America's woes haven't dampened the fervor of Iwao Tomita, one of
Asia's fiercest advocates of U.S.-style corporate governance. A
founder of Tohmatsu, Awoki &amp; Co., Japan's first national auditing
firm, Tomita has pushed for the development of a securities
regulating body similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission and
has urged Japanese companies to switch auditors, a heretical idea in
a society in which accounting relationships are passed on from father
to son.</TE>
<TE>   "For those who are engaged as auditors, the clients are theirs
forever," said Tomita, whose firm became part of the global
accounting giant Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Tomita also intends to keep fighting for the adoption of U.S.
accounting standards in Japan, though he thinks U.S. accountants
could take some lessons in ethics from their Asian counterparts. "Too
many American partners," he said, "are motivated by money."</TE>

<LD>Traffic is worse than ever. Street crime and gang violence have been
compounded for years by ever-unfolding police scandals. For a
turbulent decade--through riots and O.J. and myriad lesser issues--it
often seemed Los Angeles was falling apart. Now the fracture might
finally come: a vote in November that would cleave north and south at
the Cahuenga Pass.</LD>
<LD>   Terry Beggs has seen it all since moving here in the late 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   Fed up? Ready to move?</LD>

<TE>   "It's absolutely not perfect ... but it's going well," Beggs, 58,
said of life in his Woodland Hills neighborhood and Los Angeles as a
whole. "It could be terribly worse. I have high hopes for the place,
that things will keep going well and kids will grow up in a better
community."</TE>
<TE>   Beggs' outlook might seem surprisingly optimistic, but he is far
from alone, according to a Los Angeles Times poll whose results were
released last week. Against the darker backdrop of international
terrorism, wars, corporate collapses, a lingering economic slowdown
and other global problems, Los Angeles emerges in a light that might
even be called rosy.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-three percent of poll respondents said things are going
well, or even very well, in the city, compared with 31% who think the
city is faring badly or very badly. (Six percent were not sure.) The
level of approval was even greater when people considered their own
neighborhoods. Three residents out of four said, yes, they like the
way things are going up and down the street.</TE>
<TE>   Asians (83%) and whites (82%) expressed the highest level of
neighborhood satisfaction, but opinions also were strongly favorable
among Latinos (73%) and African Americans (65%) and in central-city
communities long plagued by poverty and social ills.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers are particularly striking when compared to Times polls
of past years. The percentage of people saying they are pleased with
the city today is twice as high as during some periods in the
mid-1990s, even though, as South Los Angeles resident William Nelson
said, much of the city still needs fixing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty satisfied with the way things are right now, but I
think, overall, nothing's changed," said Nelson, 65, an African
American who moved here in 1960. The Sept. 11 attacks on New York and
the Pentagon were "a wake-up call," he said. "You start looking at
things a little different."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles was spared those horrors and has experienced none of
the devastation of Afghanistan's Tora Bora or the suicide mass
murders of Jerusalem. It's been 10 years since L.A. was torn apart by
rioting. It's easy to be lulled by the calm, to see the sun and palm
trees and feel a little upbeat, even if it's still possible to
witness moments of violence or feel the strain of racial mistrust.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson lives near Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards
and rarely goes out after dark. His 21-year-old son, who is living at
home, walked to the street a month ago and encountered some youths
flashing gang signs. When he failed to respond, the apparent gang
members fired shots, putting a bullet hole in his car, Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident leaves Nelson unsure how to gauge his own
neighborhood. It's been "pretty stable," he said, but there are
"little things like that. It can be an aberration. It never happened
before."</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, like others, feels a sense of well-being that is tempered
by concerns that seem to persist forever. He decries the "lack of
economic opportunities for black kids. There's no new enterprises
growing up in the community that are black-oriented ... no real black
presence in terms of shops." Yet he has also seen some easing of
tensions between black patrons and Korean merchants--two groups that
clashed tragically during the 1992 riots.</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, they've gotten to know each other a little bit,"
Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Latino population has grown sharply, complicating
the racial dynamics. The resentments and occasional conflicts are
leavened with lessons to be learned.</TE>
<TE>   "You look at the work ethic of the different minorities, you kind
of sharpen your own program a little bit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Such ambiguities frame much of life in so vast and diverse a
metropolis. Romilio Lima, 40, is a Latino who lives near Koreatown.
He also expressed a high level of approval for how things are going,
but he does not paint a glossy picture of paradise. Crime and gang
violence remain significant concerns. The Los Angeles Police
Department has performed well despite the Rampart corruption scandal,
Lima said, but he criticized citizens for not being adequately
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Lima worries about the schools and frets that the proposed
secession of the Valley could cost the city needed tax dollars. Race
relations are still not very good, especially between Latinos and
African Americans, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't want to learn English," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's 10 or 20 houses on the block where we all know each
other, but in the rest [of the neighborhood] people just come and go;
nobody knows who they are," he said. "Some people don't know how to
say 'hi' or 'good morning.' I think there are a lot of communication
problems."</TE>
<TE>   Residents who believe that things are going poorly cited the same
problems, but from more critical perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   Some Are Not Impressed</TE>
<TE>   Westsider Peter Griffith, 40, has experienced no swell of civic
pride amid the flurry of antenna flags and bumper stickers that
sprouted after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A man with diverse ancestry--both Jewish and Muslim--and light
brown skin, he might be taken for Asian Indian, Latino or Middle
Eastern.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith said he feels the suspicion. When he walks his dog--part
pit bull, part ridgeback--the police sometimes cruise behind him, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel like, 'OK, they don't get it,' " said Griffith, who has
lived in his neighborhood for years. "I don't want to give the
impression I'm being harassed by police. They do good things. [But]
it's a town where people don't understand each other. The mechanism
for understanding race has never really existed here. If you're not
black or white, I don't think there's a true interest in the cultures
that exist in Los Angeles, and the differences between them.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, it's a good thing; you can blend in, and no one cares,"
he said, but it also makes him wary. "My worst fear is that one day
I'll be walking down the street, I'll be shot in a drive-by because
I'll be mistaken for some other culture, and the police will come
along and not do any investigation. Then it'll be written up in the
paper that I was killed in gang violence. To me that's Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Charlette Livingston sees a very different Los Angeles from the
suburbs of Granada Hills, far from the worst of the crime and
gangbanging.</TE>
<TE>   She taught high school in the Valley and now, at 80, is retired
and living on a fixed income.</TE>
<TE>   From her vantage point, the unrest of years past has dissipated,
and today's big issues are being handled with due attention.</TE>
<TE>   "Race relations have improved," she said. "We've gone through some
pretty awful times here ... [but] I think things have settled down
and people have realized that everybody is equal. I feel pretty good
about that. Now there's nothing I can fight for--and I'm a fighter.
There's no side to take. Everything seems to be rolling along."</TE>
<TE>   Livingston remembers visiting China many years ago, when her
husband was alive, and the way people clamored to meet a couple of
Americans. They seemed to base their hopes for the future on the
standards that America had set. The pride she felt then has been
reaffirmed by the patriotic spirit of recent months--seeing the
flags, hearing the likes of Marilyn Horne and Robert Merrill singing
American anthems on the radio.</TE>
<TE>   "What I do realize is there is no place in the world quite like
where we live," Livingston said. "I don't care, they can talk about
Europe or South America or Canada or China or anywhere else, but
somehow I feel this is the best of all possible worlds. There is hope
here. It doesn't make any difference if your family came yesterday or
in 1620. I don't think any place in the world has that."</TE>
<TE>   The only matter that troubles her, Livingston said, is the
Valley's plan to break away. Having lived in Los Angeles her entire
life, she thinks it would be "a tragedy" to chop the city in two.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is so immense, so confusing, that few see it wholly in
one light. Those who rate it highly find faults, and those who
critique it harshly see blessings.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Donner, a marriage and family therapist in Sherman Oaks, is
one of those who think things are going "pretty well." But the city
seems too big to her.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic Gets Low Marks</TE>
<TE>   "The upkeep of roads is terrible," she said. "So is traffic
congestion. There isn't any kind of rapid transit [in the Valley].
That's one of the things I hate most about L.A.--and I love L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Someone in her community was stabbed not long ago. The schools are
not what they should be. "I'm leaning toward supporting secession
right now, but don't know how I'll vote in November."</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Glennon, 67, a resident of the Palms area of the
Westside, gave the city a poor grade partly because of the
schools--"We're turning out functional illiterates"--and partly
because of potholes, traffic and sewage contamination of the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Property values are high despite the long stock-market slide. That
is great for older homeowners but a terrible hurdle for young people
seeking a place to live, Glennon said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm unhappy with a lot of things," she said, pausing, but added
that there are good parks and museums. "We have the beach. The
weather's nice. The air quality's not bad. We get a nice ocean
breeze."</TE>
<TE>   The crime in her neighborhood is not so awful--mainly graffiti and
car break-ins. She feels safe. She is happier than she at first lets
on.</TE>
<TE>   "I've lived in Miami ... San Antonio, Texas ... Denver. This is
still the best," Glennon said. "There are some kooky people out here.
I've lived here 45 years. I can't imagine living anywhere else."</TE>

<LD>To the untrained eye, the sleepy seaside town of Cape Canaveral seems
so ordinary. But there is something more (and less) to this town, and
now it's as official as the Census Bureau gets: Cape Canaveral is
Splitsville, USA. The newly-named divorce capital of the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   According to the 2000 census, 22% of the population 15 years old
or older is divorced and not remarried. (Throw in those who checked
the box for "separated," and it's 25.67%.)</LD>

<TE>   The silver medal goes to Marina del Rey (20.71%), the

<HD>Flood Waters Recede, but Texans Wary</HD>
<DH>Weather: Residents are assessing damages. 'The hardest part

killed.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BANDERA, Texas</DL>
<LD>When the creek finally drew back, there was nothing left of the
Little Horseshoe but crushed pinball machines, shattered lights and
chunks of insulation spilling from the ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a fun little place, and now I ain't got ..." owner
Kristen Schmid said Saturday, her voice breaking. She planted her
rubber boots in the sludge, glanced about the wrecked game room and
forgot to finish her sentence. She had just opened her arcade a few
months back. She never bought flood insurance. "I had a jukebox here
somewhere," she finally muttered.</LD>
<LD>   The skies over the Texas Hill Country were benevolent for the
first time since warm summer showers thickened into a week of deadly
floods and downpours. As the relatively dry day wore on, flood waters
drained slowly away and miles of devastation rose into view. Houses
had been swept off their foundations, and littered fields gaped where
trailer parks once stood. At least eight people have died in the
violent currents.</LD>
<TE>   "The water packs a punch--you need to respect it," said Bandera
Chamber of Commerce manager Patricia Moore, scraping thick slabs of
mud from the floor of the trashed visitors center. "We live with the
flooding in exchange for tall cypress trees and clear streams. It's a
lifestyle, and it's a beautiful one."</TE>
<TE>   An old cattle drive outpost and self-proclaimed "cowboy capital of
the world," Bandera is the sun-dappled, creek-laced home to dude
ranches, rodeo champions and limestone bed-and-breakfasts. Late last
week, Red Bluff Creek, Privilege Creek and Bandera Creek spilled from
their clay banks, cutting all the roads out of town and making an
island of Bandera.</TE>
<TE>   It was Saturday afternoon by the time Elva and Joe Hernandez made
their way back to the swath of slimy earth where their trailer once
stood--and found nothing but an empty cement slab, a golf club and an
old iron bed frame. "It's shocking--we thought there would be
something left," said Elva Hernandez, 42. "You find a golf ball and
think, 'Why this? Why did I find this?' "</TE>
<TE>   The water wasn't done tormenting South and Central Texas: Massive
pools still were washing over dams and working their way downstream
along the bloated rivers from Austin down toward Victoria. Thousands
have been evacuated from their homes, and many may have to stay away
for days.</TE>
<TE>   "We got no place to go if the house is ruined," said Carl Verow,
22. He folded his lanky frame into a plastic chair outside a
makeshift shelter in a New Braunfels middle school and pulled his
13-month-old son onto one knee. His wife was asleep inside--she's due
to deliver their second child next week.</TE>
<TE>   When police ordered the Verows to abandon their house on the banks
of the Guadalupe River, they moved to the shelter with nothing but a
diaper bag and the clothes on their backs. Verow's thin face was
ashen Saturday from sleepless nights on a canvas cot.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't worry," he said, kissing his boy's cheek. "I can't worry
about things until they happen."</TE>
<TE>   Bridges, farm roads and highways were washed out Saturday morning,
and thousands of people across Bandera County woke up stranded.
Rescue workers dropped food from helicopters and hurled bundles of
supplies over swollen creeks to marooned residents. Fields of
sorghum, corn and cotton were devastated. Hundreds of cattle drowned.
Across the county, 150 homes were swept away or crushed; many more
were waterlogged and badly damaged.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part is not knowing what's going to happen," said
Tina Kesei, 30, who hunched outside the New Braunfels shelter,
lighting one cigarette after the next, wiping sweat from her face.</TE>
<TE>   "Just sit and wait," Elizabeth Reynolds said in agreement, her
eyes trained on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a boy who has been in a coma since he was pulled
unconscious from the swollen Apache Creek died. Joey Alejandres was
playing on the bank five days ago when his shoe slid into the water.
He reached after it and tumbled into the current. The 11-year-old
didn't know how to swim. At least one more man was still missing
Saturday. He was last seen paddling off into the flood after his car
stalled and sank near Boerne.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Saturday, hundreds of miles away, residents fled small
towns in the dry plains of West Texas after summer storms unleashed
more than a foot of rain.</TE>
<TE>   All over the South Texas region Saturday, there was a sense that
the worst had passed. But the ground is saturated, dams are
overflowing and waterways are engorged. Another rainstorm could
provoke another disaster--and forecasters predict thunderstorms in
coming days. "If we have these torrential rains again we'll be back
to where we were," Medina County emergency manager Frank Perkins
said.</TE>
<TE>   On the front porch of a bed and breakfast on a Bandera side
street, a small, weary wedding party gathered with platters of
barbecue. In the morning, Daniel and Kimberly Cameron nearly had to
call off their wedding. The musicians were trapped, the chapel was
swamped and nobody could get to the ranch that was to host the
reception. The families were stranded on opposite banks of a flooded
river, the bridges were gone and the telephones were down.</TE>
<TE>   But the guests had flocked in from Wisconsin, Indiana and Idaho,
and nobody wanted to forgo the ceremony. And so the groom's parents
hired a helicopter from San Antonio and flew across the rivers,
clutching homemade potato salad in their laps.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of all part of the adventure," Daniel Cameron said,
posing for photographs beneath the gnarled bows of live oaks. "Now
that it's all come out all right."</TE>

<HD>Michael Jackson Says He's Not in Harmony With Sony</HD>
<DH>Music: Singer, in Harlem with the Rev. Al Sharpton, accuses
the firm of racism toward blacks. Company denies the charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michael Jackson threw down a glove on Saturday in his dispute with
Sony Music, calling its treatment of black artists racist. Sony
executives termed the accusation "bizarre" and hinted that Jackson is
losing touch.</LD>
<LD>   In an appearance with black activist Rev. Al Sharpton in Harlem,
Jackson portrayed himself as the latest in a long line of victims of
corporate exploitation. He joins other recording artists such as the
Dixie Chicks and Courtney Love in challenging what they call the
industry's unfair accounting practices. The Dixie Chicks, who had
accused Sony of ''systematic thievery," last month settled their
dispute with the firm and agreed to a new contract.</LD>
<LD>   "The record companies really do conspire against the artists,"
said Jackson to a crowd of admirers at Sharpton's National Action
Network office. "Especially the black artists."</LD>
<TE>   Jackson, whose seven releases under Sony have sold more than 100
million units, announced two weeks ago in London that he intended to
leave the company as soon as he finishes his contract. He owes the
company a greatest hits compilation with three new tracks--songs he
said he has recorded but has not handed over.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson says Sony didn't do enough to promote his latest album,
"Invincible," which had such disappointing sales that critics called
it "Invisible." But on Saturday, with the help of Sharpton and an
earlier endorsement from lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., Jackson
attempted to escalate the artists' rights movement--and his right to
a bigger share of profits --into a civil rights issue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you fight for me," Jackson said, "you're fighting for all
black people, dead and alive."</TE>
<TE>   Sony executives say Jackson is free to go at the end of his
contract and were bewildered by his attacks. "Mr. Jackson's comments
today were ludicrous, spiteful, and hurtful," a Sony Music
representative said Saturday. "It seems particularly bizarre that he
has chosen to launch an unwarranted and ugly attack on an executive
[Sony chairman Thomas D. Mottola] who has championed his career and
the careers of so many other superstars throughout the years....
Today's false statement makes it clear that Mr Jackson's difficulties
lie elsewhere than the marketing and promotion of 'Invincible.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's associates also have blamed Sony for blocking the
release of a charity single made to benefit victims of the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, "What More Can I Give." But the Sony
representative said Sony doesn't have rights to the song, and that
Jackson and the single's producer appear to be wrangling over its
release.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's friction with Sony has drawn not only the attention of
civil rights leaders, but of an intensely loyal international fan
club as well. Several hundred devotees who had gathered to present
him with a Fan Appreciation Award staged a protest in his support
Saturday in front of Sony's headquarters on Madison Avenue. While
they waited for Jackson to show up, they danced to tracks from
"Invincible" behind police barriers and waved banners portraying
Mottola as the devil.</TE>
<TE>   Tanya Spencer, 32, sat on the curb with her 4- and 11-year-old
daughters, tired from a vigil that started at 3 a.m. to ensure a good
spot at Jackson's Harlem appearance. It paid off. "I kissed him," she
said, "and he gave my girl a hug. Spencer didn't particularly like
the results of Jackson's serial plastic surgeries, she said, but
didn't begrudge him. "If you're a true fan, it's just like being a
married couple. You're supposed to love the person for better or
worse, straight from the heart."</TE>
<TE>   Helene Bayle, a 23-year-old student who started a Jackson fan club
in Europe, flew from France for the event, and said others had come
from Israel, Spain, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. She opened her
blue leather wallet to show off pictures of her with Jackson. "A
sudden arrangement of police officers in the street signaled the
crowd that Jackson was about to arrive, and they started up with a
chant deriding Sony. Then he was there, riding atop a red
double-decker tourist bus, shielded from the sun by a black umbrella,
and flashing peace signs, one hand clad in a black glove. Sharpton
stood at his side.</TE>
<TE>   The fans burst from behind the barricades and, screaming, followed
the bus down the middle of Madison Avenue. They were chased in turn
by 22 surprised police officers. The bus hit a young woman who darted
in front of it trying to get a better glimpse of Jackson, injuring
her shoulder. The bus then turned the corner to circle back for a
second round of drive-by admiration.</TE>
<TE>   People walking in Midtown paused, though just barely, to take in
the bizarre parade. "Michael Jackson?" said Angela Gutierrez. "That's
all? I thought it was some kind of attack."</TE>

<HD>Airport Security Stakes Rising</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Air travelers are likely to find even longer
waits and more intrusive searches as the federal government takes
over screening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Fourth of July shootings at Los Angeles International Airport
raise the stakes for the federal government as it plunges into a
major security makeover at airports around the country.</LD>
<LD>   The violence only underscores how difficult it will be for the new
and untested Transportation Security Administration to find the few
intent on causing harm among the millions of people who fly daily.</LD>
<LD>   The task of "federalizing" 429 airports with different layouts,
travel patterns and threats will be a vastly complicated undertaking
that could encumber travel, especially during peak times, industry
and government officials warn.</LD>
<TE>   They predict longer lines and more intrusive searches as federal
screeners take over hundreds of security checkpoints during this
summer travel season and into the fall. And more delays by the end of
the year, when millions of passengers will have to open their checked
luggage to be inspected for explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "Eventually, we should have one of the safest systems in the
world, but getting there is a hassle," said Rep. John L. Mica
(R-Fla.), chairman of the House aviation subcommittee. "Between
Thanksgiving and Christmas, you have the possibility of a complete
meltdown."</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the security takeover is the TSA, a huge new law
enforcement agency. Still unknown to many Americans, its employees
will be picking through people's carry-ons and asking some passengers
to step aside to be patted down.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has placed sky-high demands on the new agency: Create a
system that will screen 670 million travelers and 1 billion checked
bags a year in ways that cannot easily be undermined by terrorists.
And install it by New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   The goal might never have been realistic, and the agency is
already behind the curve. It will need an estimated 33,000 screeners
to check passengers and an additional 30,000 to examine luggage. It
has deployed fewer than 3,000. Thousands of bomb detection units that
the agency is buying may have to be replaced in a few years by
automated machines that don't require bags to be opened.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, TSA officials said the agency plans to eventually
extend its reach to ticket lobbies, garages and other public areas of
the airport now patrolled by local and state police. It's always been
part of the congressional mandate, said a spokesman, but there is no
timetable yet for widespread deployment of armed TSA police officers
and undercover agents.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis believes installing such guards "is the logical
next step" in tightening security, his spokesman, Steve Maviglio,
said Saturday. He said the issue has been under discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, an Egyptian immigrant opened fire at an El Al ticket
counter at LAX, killing two people before an airline security guard
fatally shot him. It raised new concerns about security before
passengers ever get to a security checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   "Our responsibility for aviation security extends from the
perimeter of the airport ... to checkpoints and beyond, in fact, to
the successful conclusion of each and every flight," a TSA statement
said.</TE>
<TE>   Airline and airport executives, however, fear that the security
agency will turn out like a cross between Inspector Clouseau and
Detective Sipowicz--an unpredictable combination of hapless bumbler
and bullheaded cop.</TE>
<TE>   TSA officials respond that federal security will be intelligent,
thorough and customer-friendly. Its better-trained but unproven
screeners will replace private security employees.</TE>
<TE>   Yet within the aviation community, a consensus has formed that the
TSA risks harming the very industry it was set up to protect. The
agency's leadership is perceived by some critics as isolated and
unresponsive, heavy on law enforcement and military veterans who have
little experience with the complex choreography of aviation.</TE>
<TE>   "You have bright, intelligent people with unimpeachable law
enforcement backgrounds," said David Plavin, head of Airports Council
International, a major trade group. "But they don't know anything
about transportation and they don't understand what it means to keep
the system moving. The first year or two of this process is going to
be messy and ugly under the best of circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines estimates the industry will lose $3.8 billion in
revenue this year because of people not flying to avoid the "hassle
factor" of security.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta
defended the security efforts. "I don't think TSA has the tin ear the
airports and airlines accuse it of having," he said. "I think they
are now listening."</TE>
<TE>   Returning to the previous security system is out of the question,
Mineta added. "Security was minimal before," he said. "There was no
consistency and uniformity."</TE>
<TE>   The new system is on view at Baltimore-Washington International,
the first major airport to be "federalized" with government
screeners.</TE>
<TE>   There are more checkpoint screeners, more searches--and longer
lines, say BWI frequent fliers. A Travelocity survey found that BWI
has the slowest checkpoints among major airports. Nationally, 63% of
passengers said they cleared checkpoints in 15 minutes or less, while
42% of BWI passengers got through that quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Airport security lines have generally been diminishing this year,
and Mineta has said travelers should not have to wait more than 10
minutes at the new federal checkpoints. But there was near-gridlock
at BWI on Memorial Day weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "There were people looking at people, who were looking at people
who were looking at you," said Annapolis, Md., lawyer Harry
Blumenthal, who flies out of BWI every week. "If anything was found
suspicious, there were a lot of people looking at it. Even if it was
innocuous, you would still be required to do a full search."</TE>
<TE>   Blumenthal's trip to Florida turned into an endurance test. "It
took me an hour to get to the head of the line, only to find out it
was a holding line," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't say anything to the screeners about it,
because if you act at all belligerent or concerned, next thing you
know there'll be a guy with a rifle in your face."</TE>
<TE>   The TSA is trying to smooth out glitches at BWI, airport officials
said. The federal security force was trying to do too much at the
beginning. For instance, new screeners were getting on-the-job
training during peak hours. That has now stopped, BWI officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel more secure because of the federal presence, but with
that comes longer time," said BWI spokeswoman Melanie Miller.</TE>
<TE>   The personnel-heavy approach is partly because of antiquated metal
detectors and X-ray machines inherited from airline security, said
Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), who chairs a panel that oversees the
agency's budget. "We're in midstream here, right in the middle of
this process, so there's still a lot of ragged edges."</TE>
<TE>   The rough going is evident.</TE>
<TE>   In Orlando, Fla., a TSA advance team recently showed up
unannounced at the airport and set up a hiring center for screeners.
When the airport director went to investigate--and introduce
himself--he was threatened with arrest for trespassing in a federal
area. The agency apologized.</TE>
<TE>   In Louisville, Ky., the new TSA airport security chief was
summarily suspended last month after he flashed his identification to
help a passenger circumvent a checkpoint. Trying to assist a woman
who was in a rush to catch her flight, he violated a rule that every
passenger must be screened.</TE>
<TE>   Even the elite air marshals have been humbled. Some have gone out
on missions only to find that no arrangements had been made for
flying them back home, a congressional official said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the confusion, many TSA employees express a sense of
mission and earnest patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the American public would be very, very proud if they saw
the level of commitment and dedication," said Gail Rossides, the
TSA's director of training.</TE>
<TE>   "People are coming to work for the right reasons, to do the right
thing. And these are not easy jobs. People are working seven days a
week, 14 hours a day to get this done."</TE>
<TE>   The TSA also pays competitively. Air marshals start at $45,500;
base pay for TSA law enforcement agents ranges from $31,100 to
$36,400, and screeners start at $23,600 to $29,500, depending on
experience.</TE>
<TE>   One consequence has been an exodus of hundreds of officers from
other federal agencies and local police departments. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service has lost more than 560 agents to the TSA,
including almost 400 Border Patrol officers.</TE>
<TE>   The salaries come from the estimated $6.8 billion taxpayers will
pour into the agency this year. That figure is more than 45 times
what the Federal Aviation Administration spent on security in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Security is improving, said Transportation Department Inspector
General Kenneth Mead. He cited reinforced cockpit doors, much greater
numbers of air marshals and the willingness of passengers to confront
people behaving suspiciously. He also credited the TSA for bringing
energy and discipline to its mission.</TE>
<TE>   "The system we have today is much more effective than what we had
before Sept. 11," Mead said.</TE>
<TE>   "It needs to be a lot better still. We still find alarming lapses,
but when these lapses occur, they are paid attention to. I see a
genuine interest in incorporating the lessons learned from mistakes
into training."</TE>
<TE>   However, the two main initiatives that the TSA will be judged on
this year appear to be in serious jeopardy. By Nov. 19, the agency
must have federal screeners in place at 429 airports with regular
commercial service. By Dec. 31, it must be able to screen all checked
luggage for bombs using explosives detection technology.</TE>
<TE>   Few observers think the timetable is realistic. When Mineta raised
the same concern early this year, he was drowned out by an outcry
from lawmakers. Since then, he has unswervingly insisted that the
deadlines will be met.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a determination made by the administration as a
whole that our obligation is to comply with the law," Mineta said.</TE>
<TE>   What if there aren't enough federal screeners on hand by Nov. 19?</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that we don't get our full strength at any airport,
we may just have to cut some [checkpoint] lanes," he responded.</TE>
<TE>   What will happen at the remaining lanes?</TE>
<TE>   "Long lines," Mineta said. "Long lines. Long lines."</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers wrote the deadlines into law because the Transportation
Department had a notorious record of watering down security
recommendations. Now there is a sense that Congress may have been too
prescriptive.</TE>
<TE>   "Haste makes waste," said Carol Hallett, head of the Air Transport
Assn., the main airline trade group. As a former U.S. Customs
commissioner, Hallett once had to quickly hire 1,000 agents for the
war on drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that doing anything of that magnitude in a short period
of time, you make mistakes, you overlook things," Hallett said.</TE>
<TE>   The TSA is going to have to hire about 4,000 screeners a week to
meet its deadlines.</TE>
<TE>   Congress itself has made the TSA's job more difficult simply by
moving at its usual bureaucratic pace to approve legislation and
funding. The debate over creating the agency bogged down for weeks
last fall over the issue of whether screeners should be federal
employees. When the Aviation and Transportation Security Act was
finally signed Nov. 19, lawmakers began sending mixed messages about
their level of commitment.</TE>
<TE>   A senator seeking attention on an unrelated local matter stalled
confirmation of TSA head John Magaw. Even now, the House and Senate
have yet to pass $4.4 billion in emergency funding requested by
President Bush. The agency is being kept solvent with transfers from
other federal agencies, but that strategy can work for only a few
more weeks before it runs into legal problems.</TE>
<TE>   Mica, who had unsuccessfully argued to loosen the deadlines, said
Congress may well have to make a midcourse correction. He complained
that the rush to carry out the law has shut down a needed debate on
what kind of aviation security system the country should have.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we have a pretty offensive system to passengers,
because we're almost assuming all of them are guilty," Mica said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost the reverse of what our justice system is based on.
We should be concentrating on risk and letting the 80-year-old
grandmothers go by."</TE>

Southeast Asian Cuisine</DH>

<LD>Whatever Golden Boy is drinking, I want some. The guy's sitting on
top of the world, literally, his chubby behind touching down
somewhere in the Arctic Circle. A healthy blush kisses his cheeks,
while a vibrant corona seems ready to engulf him from behind. His
right hand flashes thumbs-up. His left cradles a giant bottle of his
own product: Golden Boy Brand fish sauce.</LD>
<LD>   His is not the only fishsauce label you can see in the Southland
these days. From Westminster to Pomona to Mar Vista, it's pretty easy
to find brands such as Tra Chang, Squid and Tiparos, most of them
priced at less than $2 for a 725-milliliter bottle.</LD>
<TE>   A lot of us are only now becoming familiar with this ancient
ingredient. Southeast Asians consume tens of millions of gallons of
fermented fish sauce every year. In Thailand it is known as nam pla,
meaning "fish water." It is nuoc mam in Vietnam, tuk trey in
Cambodia, budu in rural Malaysia, gnapi in Burma, shottsuru in Japan.
In Eagle Rock they call it patis. At least they do on one hilltop,
where Gloria Valde, a dentist by profession, has been known to make
her own fish sauce for a range of Filipino dishes. Gloria's daughter
Jane, also a dentist, is my wife's friend from college. My wife
admits to being slightly horrified at the sight of anchovies being
"digested" by their own enzymes in a jar next to the Valde driveway.
(She was equally spooked by the lifelike plaster dental molds strewn
about the landscaping). And the Valdes' dogs aren't exactly thrilled
about the patis production, either. Jane says they bark vehemently
whenever someone removes the lid.</TE>
<TE>   For human or hound, the making of fish sauce is an earthy
experience. The age-old method calls for placing fresh fish in a vat
or jar, covering them in brine and setting them in the sun. Any fish
can be used, but anchovies are especially popular because they are
too small to offer much value as an entree. The vats are periodically
opened to allow direct sunlight to hit the fish, but the process is
mostly passive. Over time, the fish solids turn to liquid. After up
to 18 months, the deep-amber liquid is poured off, filtered, placed
in the sun for a couple of additional weeks, bottled and sold.</TE>
<TE>   Good fish sauce should look a lot like good whiskey, and it's
equally staggering at first whiff. But high-grade fish sauce isn't
nearly as "fishy" as you might expect. Instead of pure saltiness, you
get a robust and complex burst of the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The Thai use nam pla in practically every meal they cook: noodle
dishes, salads, sauces, soups and more. (Some call it the soy sauce
of Thailand.) And nam pla prik--a mixture of fish sauce and diced
chiles--might be Thailand's most commonplace condiment.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it this way: If you like Thai food, you have already been
converted to nam pla. Why not experiment with it at home? At the same
time, we can't really recommend the homemade variety. The barking
dogs bug the neighbors.</TE>

<DH>The U.S. Army Rangers Sought Redemption in Afghanistan as They
Embarked on Their First Combat Mission Since the Tragic 1993 Battle
That Killed 18 Soldiers in Mogadishu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kim Murphy</AU>
<BD>Kim Murphy is The Times' Seattle bureau chief. She last wrote
for the magazine on the murder of gun control advocate Tom Wales.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For military aviators, there are two kinds of darkness. There is the
night of a luminous moon and the patchwork carpet of sleeping cities,
nights where targets are easy and the runway is near. And then there
is the Afghanistan night during a new moon, so dark it seems to suck
up the starlight. The blackness below might shroud a desert plateau,
or the sharp edge of a mountain, or a small figure aiming an
antiaircraft gun at the sky.</LD>
<LD>   These are the things that go through men's minds when they ride in
on those nights, huddled in the belly of an MC-130 Combat Talon
aircraft. That their paratrooper pack is strapped on and ready. That
their wife seemed to hold on for an extra moment when they left her a
few weeks before. That the plane seems to be slowing and it's almost
time to get hooked up and ready to jump. That the Taliban probably
has a few Stinger missiles. That when it's time they'll line up at
the door and leap into the void, counting out the seconds before they
can expect the invisible ground to pound into their feet. Run through
the script: 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, contact! Find your
buddies and start moving. Once again: Hook up, line up, jump, count,
hit, move. That outside the cargo door that just opened there's a
great big, windy patch of night, and Jesus never made a night so
black.</LD>
<TE>   It is 10:45 p.m., Oct. 19, somewhere over the desert of southern
Afghanistan. The new crescent moon is still lodged under the horizon.
In unison, over the roar of the MC-130's big engines, the men begin
to shout the creed of the U.S. Army Rangers:</TE>
<TE>   I accept that as a Ranger my country expects me to move farther,
faster and fight harder than any other soldier. Never shall I fail my
comrades .... Energetically will I meet the enemies of my country. I
shall defeat them on the field of battle, for I am better trained and
will fight with all my might. Surrender is not a Ranger word. I will
never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy ....
Readily will I display the intestinal fortitude required to fight on
to the Ranger objective and complete the mission, though I be the
lone survivor.</TE>
<TE>   "One minute, thirty seconds," the pilot radioes into Staff Sgt.
James Anderson's earpiece. Just ahead is a Taliban airstrip with a
complex of buildings, one of which has been identified as a military
barracks for a small guard force. The buildings are aflame from a
barrage of U.S. preassault airstrikes launched moments before. The
mission for these 200 men of the 75th Infantry (Ranger) Regiment of
Fort Benning, Ga.: take over the airstrip, kill any Taliban still
resisting, gather intelligence documents from the complex, secure the
buildings, then get out again.</TE>
<TE>   "Target in sight," Anderson shouts over the roaring noise of wind
and engine coining through the open doors. "Thirty seconds."</TE>
<TE>   Ten seconds out, Anderson steps back and thumps the first two
jumpers. "Go!" he screams. From all four planes, two jumpers exit
each second, and soon all 200 are suspended in the Afghan night,
gliding down through the terrible no man's land between aircraft and
ground, between safety and peril, between what has already happened
and what is going to happen next.</TE>
<TE>   Contact! Look for your buddies in the dark. Move.</TE>
<TE>   Before this raid on the airstrip near Kandahar that night, the war
in Afghanistan was a 2-week-old air campaign, conducted by remote
control from planes that dropped bombs and broadcast the results on
video screens. When the night was over, the Americans had conducted
their first full-fledged ground assault, and even the oldest,
gruffest generals back home could call what was happening in
Afghanistan a war. American troops had landed. They had been shot at,
and shot back, and heard the screams of dying enemies. A combat squad
had walked into a Taliban outpost, keyed the mike on the radio and
declared, "Clear."</TE>
<TE>   It was not a huge battle--about 20 Taliban died, most from
preassault airstrikes. The American casualties came not from enemy
fire but from a helicopter accident, and legs broken when they landed
hard oil the desert floor. There was no new front line established --
a few hours after the Rangers landed on the airfield, they left
again.</TE>
<TE>   But the raid marked a crucial turning point in the new war, not
only for the military strategists who demonstrated the U.S.' ability
to strike deep within enemy territory, but for the Army Rangers
themselves, who that night launched their first major combat mission
since the 1993 quagmire in Mogadishu, Somalia -- the miserable street
battle that left 18 soldiers dead and inspired the recent Hollywood
release "Black Hawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   After that night, the U.S. was able to move in a battalion-sized
expeditionary unit of Marines, who would use the airstrip as a
forward operating base known as Camp Rhino. Soon after that night
there was no longer any real question that American forces could
operate virtually unimpeded anywhere in Afghanistan, including on the
doorstep of the Taliban's spiritual headquarters at Kandahar.</TE>
<TE>   "The mission was to destroy the Taliban at that location. It was
to gather intelligence on what exactly was going on at that facility,
and really the most important thing, after all was said and done, was
the fact that we established it as it legitimate forward staging base
in southern Afghanistan, setting the stage for having a permanent
American presence. That's a classic Ranger operation," says Maj. John
Renda, who conducted electronic warfare operations for the 75th
Regiment in Southern Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "The other part was sending a message to the Taliban leadership,"
Renda says. "That U.S. forces could act with relative impunity,
attack at will, leverage massive firepower at a precise location. And
then disappear." Unspoken was the unofficial desire to purge the
demons of Somalia, to show the world that the disaster on the streets
of Mogadishu was a tragic exception.</TE>
<TE>   AIRFIELD SEIZURES ARE A BREAD-AND-BUTTER OPERATION FOR THE
RANGERS, a force of about 2,100 highly trained light infantry
soldiers who are the only mainline Army troops able to conduct
special operations -- to enter enemy territory unseen, engage in
major combat to secure new ground and attempt to return alive.</TE>
<TE>   Rangers are the kind of soldiers who slog through swamps with
107-pound packs without food for days on end, prepared to be deployed
anywhere in the world within 18 hours. They sport the unmistakable,
shaved-on-the-sides haircut -- extremely tight and very high," they
tell their barbers -- that distinguishes them from what they tend to
dismissively call "the big Army." No women, and kindly don't ask them
why.</TE>
<TE>   The Kandahar airfield raid, timed to coincide with a special
forces assault on Mullah Mohammed Omar's compound the same night,
actually began as a training drill at Ft. Benning only a few days
after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, though the
soldiers had no idea at the time that they were training for the real
thing.</TE>
<TE>   The airfield they would target had appeared on no maps or
satellite imagery prior to 2000. A confidential informant told U.S.
intelligence officers about the small complex of buildings there,
surrounded by a 7-foot-high perimeter wall and observation posts,
with a small Taliban guard force housed outside.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought, 'How many people would it take to defend this
building 24 hours a day, seven days a week? We figured, four people
per shift in this building, plus one or two people in the guard
towers -- 15 to 20 people," says Col. Robert Whalen, the regiment's
44-year-old intelligence officer, who helped design the operation.</TE>
<TE>   Whalen, unlike the 18- and 19-year old recruits who normally try
out for the Rangers, had come late to soldiering. After growing up
the son of a career Marine officer, Whalen was determined to have
nothing to do with the military. He got a degree in economics at
Yale, another B.A. and a master's in economics from Oxford
University, and was thinking of going to law school or medical
school. Then he went to Germany on a scholarship and visited East
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   I had never seen a communist country before, a dictatorship," he
says. "It was really astonishing to me. And it really brought home to
me that there are really good reasons why we have armies in places
like Germany, to allow people to live ordinary lives. It hit me like
a punch to the solar plexus. And I thought it might not be a bad way
to spend a career." He signed up for the Rangers, as a first
lieutenant in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Whalen and regiment commander Col. Joseph Votel were careful not
to tell the rest of the men that the operation they were rehearsing
at Ft. Benning was a dead ringer for an assault on a desert airstrip
in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the men had known as soon as they turned on their
televisions on Sept. 11 that they wouldn't be home much longer.</TE>
<TE>   "We were out doing a training exercise when Sept. 11 happened,"
recalls 1st Lt. Tom Bostick, 32, who left the small town of Llano,
Texas, to work as an Army enlisted intelligence analyst, then went to
officer training school and became platoon leader for the Rangers'
Alpha Company. "We heard a plane hit one of the buildings, and we
came back and saw on TV the second plane hit. Then we knew there
might really be something. Really, our thoughts were, 'Oh my God,
we're gonna go.' "</TE>
<TE>   Capt. Douglas Vincent, administrative headquarters commander, was
driving into the office after a workout when he heard the news on
NPR. "I came in and we had CNN on in the office. We all had a feeling
that something would be happening."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent was careful not to say anything to his four brothers and
sisters when they called. But keeping an impending deployment under
wraps on base was another thing. The wives just seem to know that
sort of thing, Vincent says. They can sense it."</TE>
<TE>   Vincent had gone to the same high school in Boca Raton, Fla., as
his wife, but the two didn't meet until a few years later, when he
was home on leave from the Virginia Military Institute. A priest who
taught at their high school married them, and when Afghanistan began
to loom in the news, Vincent's father took a handful of medals of St.
Michael, patron saint of paratroopers, to be blessed by the same
priest.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent had four of them in his pocket as he and the other Rangers
left Ft. Benning Oct. 12, headed for a forward staging base at a
secret location, a few hours' flight from Afghanistan. He told his
wife they'd be protecting him. "Don't worry," he told her. "We're the
best guys possible to do this mission. I'm probably in the safest
place I could be, because of the nature of the people around me."</TE>
<TE>   He really felt that way, Vincent says. He had spent more time with
these men than anyone, probably even his wife. He knew how strong
they were. He knew how bad it had to be before they broke. He knew
they wouldn't come home without him. And he knew if somebody ought to
be sent over there to do something, it ought to be them.</TE>
<TE>   AT THE FORWARD STAGING BASE, WHALEN AND HIS INTELLIGENCE CREW
BEGAN the painstaking task of assembling an exact picture of what the
Kandahar airstrip looked like, along with the terrain around it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my job to gather all the imagery we could," Whalen says,
first from satellite photos, then drone aircraft, and later, as U.S.
planes took control of the skies, Whalen's own imagery specialist,
flying in a P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft equipped with infrared
sensors able to take still photos and video imagery of the target
during daylight and at night.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed to find out: This is what the target looks like, this
is how big it is, these are the walls, this is how high the walls
are, this is where the doors are, we think the doors open inward or
outward, these are the people that are defending the target, these
are the kind of weapons they have. What does the runway look like?
How is the terrain -- how hard are you going to hit when you fall?"</TE>
<TE>   Some of the answers to the questions came from carefully studying
photographs of the same location over different days. Tents that were
there one day and gone the next -- what did that mean? Vehicle tracks
one day, no tracks the next day, or tracks in a different direction.
Footprints in the sand. Allcould provide clues to the number and
location of Taliban who were likely to be on site at P-hour -- the
time the paratroopers landed.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd try to figure out, what the hell goes on inside each of
those buildings, and what would be needed to defend it?" Whalen says.</TE>
<TE>   With the evidence available, Whalen's team prepared a situation
template, representing their best guess of what the paratroopers
might expect when they arrived, displaying it in a powerpoint slide
presentation transmitted back to headquarters in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights before the mission, scale photos were laid out on a
large concrete floor inside a warehouse, and small model buildings
were laid on top for a "rock drill," a talkthrough of the mission
that brought together not only the Rangers who would be on the
ground, but the various commanders, pilots, refuelers and others who
would have a role.</TE>
<TE>   By then, each Ranger knew what rock he was supposed to go to for
meeting up with the other members of his team, what depression in the
ground would indicate he was almost to the rock, the location where
one team would set up covering fire, another would enter a building,
another would watch the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   The men, meanwhile, were preparing themselves, mentally and
physically. They started reversing their sleep cycles, sleeping by
day and remaining awake at night. "The longer we were there, I sort
of started tapering off, I got to the point where I was only eating
once a day. A couple times I stopped eating for 48 hours," says Sgt.
1st Class Thomas Pendleton, 30, a sniper platoon sergeant.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, 26, who was a weapons squad leader in addition to his
role as jump master on the inbound flight, drilled his squad
repeatedly. They rehearsed the way they would set up a
support-by-fire position with their three M-240-B machine guns to
cover the line squads as they moved in to attack the enemy position.
They practiced what they would do if they got engaged by the enemy
and had to move to a different position. Anderson would go to each
man on his squad. "What are we doing?" he'd ask, so many times it got
tedious. "What's our mission? How am we going to assemble?"</TE>
<TE>   "The day before the mission, we had pretty much the entire day for
ourself," Pendleton says. "We spent the entire day doing last-minute
changes to equipment. Guys could take their time packing things,
making sure everything was in its right place."</TE>
<TE>   There was a moment of last-minute panic, when a new surveillance
photo came in showing what looked for all the world like the turret
of a tank sticking out of one of the tents.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the analysts came in and said, 'I think there's a tank on
the objective,' and everybody just shut up. Because that changes
everything," Renda says. "They went in and did their magic
manipulation, and figured out it was not. But it was almost surreal.
We had been studying this thing for a month. We had rehearsed
communications, rehearsed the fire-support package, everything, it
was like written out in a book. You were on autopilot. And when that
little event occurred, it makes you realize, this is for real. Let's
not get too comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   OCT. 19, DUSK. FOUR MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT TAKE OFF FROM THE
forward staging base, just behind an assault force of AC-130 gunships
headed for a pre-assault airstrike on the target in the minutes
before the paratroopers land. The goal: wipe out as many of the 15 to
20 members of the guard force on the ground as possible before the
first paratrooper jumps out of the plane. Leave the rest of them
stunned.</TE>
<TE>   It takes several hours to reach southern Afghanistan. "A lot of
guys slept on the way in, which is normal," says Vincent. "Actually,
what I was thinking about was exiting the airplane. And then every
single thing I do from the moment we stand up, to the moment I go out
of the aircraft, to the moment I touch the ground. Visualization is
what they call it. It just makes me feel calm. And then I pictured
everything I needed to do on the ground, which was assemble all my
guys and move my guys to where we need to be to do what we need to do
when we get there, which is command and control."</TE>
<TE>   A little after 10:30 p.m., the men on each aircraft began to
recite the Ranger Creed. It was something they don't normally do on
combat jumps-but this wasn't a normal jump. Then, 10 minutes out from
target, Anderson gave the command: "Everybody up!"</TE>
<TE>   As the men begin hooking their static lines onto a long cable
running the length of the aircraft, Anderson opened the doors and
leaned out into the slipstream, where he was suspended over the
desert in a blast of freezing air. It was so black he couldn't see
anything except the glow of burning buildings ahead in the distance
-- a reassuring sight. It meant the gunships had done their job. It
meant many of the Taliban down there were already dead.</TE>
<TE>   As they quickly found out on landing, a single Taliban soldier had
survived the aerial assault and was firing green tracer rounds from
within the building complex. A Ranger squad made out the soldier with
their night-vision goggles. "As soon as the SAW [machine gun] gunner
opened up, it was over. The guy dropped, and he was done," Renda
says.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, the psychological operations team began
broadcasting a prerecorded message in Pashto, the southern
Afghanistan dialect, over loudspeakers. "U.S. forces are here to
conduct combat operations," the message said. "For your own safety,
remain flat on the ground with your arms extended. If you encounter
U.S. forces, remain on the ground, you will not be harmed." But there
was no one to broadcast to. Everyone was already dead.</TE>
<TE>   Vincent located Votel and the other senior commanders in the
landing zone, and it took them less than eight minutes to walk to the
prearranged command and control location near the runway. "I
basically memorized the layout of the airfield, and I knew basically
how far it was from where we were assembling to where we were going,"
Vincent says. "I'd pace count, look for prominent features. I knew
there's a little rise in the ground here, a dip in the ground there
...."</TE>
<TE>   As he stood guard, he could hear explosions in the building
complex behind him. But Vincent's job was to keep his back to the
commanders, standing with his rifle staring out into the darkness
around them.</TE>
<TE>   At the tactical operations center back at the staging base, Renda
was anxious.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting in the command and control tent, we had the radios
on speaker so you could hear all the transmissions from the
regimental commander. Here we're responsible for doing all these
plans, to make sure everything happens the way it's supposed to. And
we just listen to the radios, hoping everything goes the way it's
supposed to. Your heart's with these soldiers," Renda says.</TE>
<TE>   "We were listening to the airplanes, and we heard 'em say,
'Jumpers away. ' Then the pilots stopped [talking], they dropped off
the net, and it took a long time for the regimental commander and his
little cell to come up on the radio. There was a good 15, almost 20
minutes when we were sitting there, 'Oh God, what the hell happened?'
And then all of a sudden, comms came up. It was like, 'Yeah, we're
all here, a couple of minor injuries on the jump, but we've got the
situation under control here and we're getting ready to move on the
compound.'"</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, a soldier on the thermal weapons site spotted some
lights and heat in the distance, and looking in his nightvision
goggles, he saw a vehicle heading toward the airstrip. Bostick's crew
called in the sighting to command and control, and an aircraft fired
on the vehicle, destroying it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they were surprised at how well the U.S. military can see
at night," says Pendleton. "I think they figured if they just flipped
off the headlights, they'd be good." Several other Taliban vehicles
were similarly dispatched.</TE>
<TE>   Bostick took his squad and cleared out a dug-in fighting position
overlooking the airfield. Just below it was a tent with fresh tire
tracks around it. "We cleared it and went back to our fighting
position," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Teams began moving through the buildings in the complex, looking
for documents of possible intelligence value and any evidence that
the Taliban -- as some suspected -- might have been using the
buildings for drug processing. Another team examined the runway, to
determine whether it could safely support the MC-130s, and any other
aircraft the military might want to use to supply a base there later.
When it was deemed safe, the MC-130s landed, and exfiltration --
loading the paratroopers back onto the aimraft for the flight home --
began.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers left behind a pile of fliers with the famous picture
of the New York firefighters raising the flag at the World Trade
Center. "Freedom endures," it said in English and Pashtu.</TE>
<TE>   It was still not dawn. Imagery after the fact showed about 30
Taliban bodies, either at the complex or in vehicles nearby. The U.S.
tally was far less. Two American troops had sustained leg and ankle
injuries during the parachute landing. Two others were killed many
miles away in Pakistan, when a helicopter supporting the mission
crashed on landing. There was a certain sense of letdown on the quiet
flight back, that the fighting hadn't been fiercer, but more keenly
there was a sense that America had gone to war, and they had done
their part.</TE>
<TE>   "When my kids are in school reading, 'Hey, there's this thing in
Afghanistan,' You can tell 'em, 'We were there first. We were the

No matter how big or little it was, one day your kids can tell you,

<LD>Ex-teen idols may understand the vagaries of fame better than anyone.
Just ask florist Michael Gray, 54, who starred as Billy Batson on the
hit '70's TV series "Shazam!" His shag-haired puss graced countless
fanzines alongside fellow heartthrobs such as Michael Jackson and
Donny Osmond. The spotlight fizzled, however, and Gray had a rough go
of it before finding his way to marriage and purchase of Casabella,
his in-laws' Beverly Hills flower shop, which he's built into a
successful business catering to industry clients such as Garry
Marshall, Berry Gordy, Stevie Nicks and, oh yes, a neighborhood
family called the Osbournes.</LD>
<LD>   From Tiger Beat to tiger lilies--seems like a long journey.</LD>
<LD>   I wouldn't want Tiger Beat again, not that I could have it. I
enjoyed it a lot at the time, sure, but I wanted to be an actor. I
was just born with the looks I had and the teenyboppers took to them,
and my managers steered me there.</LD>
<TE>   Is it tough serving famous people?</TE>
<TE>   The problem is not the people. I love being around entertainment
people, always have. What's difficult is, there's a void in me that
wants to be acting. And I'm not. Some people have made peace with it,
but it's still a hunger for me.</TE>
<TE>   Why does teen stardom often not carry over into adult success?</TE>
<TE>   I've done so may soul-searching episodes with myself over that
issue. It may be an industry thing, people scoffing, "Oh, you were a
teenage idol, we can't put you on our show." Or it may be an audience
perception thing, I just don't know.</TE>
<TE>   How do today's teen interviews compare to the '70s?</TE>
<TE>   You mean, what's my favorite color, do I like girls with long or
short hair, what is my favorite pet dog? Back then I always answered
those questions truthfully. That was a different epoch. Today, kids
are far more advanced. We'd probably get more questions [a la Howard
Stern accomplice "Stuttering" John Melendez], who once, incidentally,
interviewed me--his first question was, "Do you masturbate?"</TE>
<TE>   Have you seen yourself watering plants on any MTV segments of "The
Osbournes"?</TE>
<TE>   When I was there for a Christmas installation I saw a tiny camera
they'd placed on a tripod behind a potted palm in the entryway. I
walked up to it, stuck my eyeball on the lens and said, "Hi, remember
me?" Since everyone else had to sign a release and they never asked
me, I assume my eyeball wasn't that amusing.</TE>
<TE>   What flower should a man not send a woman?</TE>
<TE>   Carnations. My mother loves carnations, so she'll be upset with
me. But it's an old-fashioned, not very romantic flower. He should
send something delicate and feminine like tulips and lilies. Men like
to send women roses. Women don't like to receive them, at least
that's what I've learned from my female clients. They'd prefer
something more feminine and unusual.</TE>

<LD>Not long ago, state assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles)
tried to make California the first state to ban race- and
ethnic-based school nicknames. After clearing some intermediate
legislative hurdles, her much-amended measure ran into a brick wall
of local tradition and Republican sneering about political
correctness in the Assembly.</LD>
<LD>   Sooner or later, however, well-meaning politicos are bound to try
again to bring this enduring manifestation of breezy stereotyping
into alignment with more highly evolved modern sensibilities. If they
succeed, about one-fifth of California's 1,292 sports-playing high
schools, by my reckoning, will have to re-nickname themselves and
adopt new mascots.</LD>
<LD>   School nicknames compose a small but venerable subcategory of jock
talk. Many a sports-bar laugh fest has turned on obscure and colorful
names. (No state matches Illinois in this regard; what other can
boast such transcendencies as the Cobden Appleknockers, the Hoopeston
Cornjerkers, the Freeburg Midgets and the Effingham Flaming Hearts?)</LD>
<TE>   Perusing the list of nicknames of California's 1,292 high schools,
I calculate 258 of them to be potentially offensive to somebody
somewhere. By far, the largest category is Native American names,
which are claimed by 82 schools. The most common, both in the Native
American category and overall among the 258, is Warriors. Other
Native American nicknames are Indians (15 schools), Braves
(10--although two, Sherman Indian High School in Riverside and Noli
Indian School in San Jacinto, would seem perfectly entitled to the
moniker), Aztecs (8), Apaches (4), Redskins (4), Chieftains (2) and
Comanches (1).</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five are Spanish-derived, and thus Latino referencing. The
most popular among them is Dons (14), followed by Matadors (8),
Conquistadors (5), Vaqueros (3), Gauchos (3) and Toreadors (2).</TE>
<TE>   Muslims, meanwhile, well could take offense at Sultans (2), and
Moors, Arabs and Sheiks (1 each). Neither, surely, are they delighted
by all those Crusaders (14 schools).</TE>
<TE>   The second most common among the 258, is Vikings, which, at first
glance seems innocuous enough. Yet the invocation of those infamous
early marauders might well rub the more sensitive among modern
Danes--one of the world's most civilized people--the wrong way.
They're not the only northern Europeans potentially umbraged, either,
having company in the Scots (5), Celts (1), Celtics (1), Gaels (2)
and Fighting Irish (2).</TE>
<TE>   The point here is, once you start cleaning up nicknames, where
should you stop? Racial, ethnic and tribal names aren't the only ones
that conflict with present social values. Warlike Spartans (25) and
Trojans (16) abound and, aside from any uncomfortable resonances they
may hold for Greek Americans, don't exactly bespeak the peaceableness
we're constantly begging our teenagers to practice. The same applies
to the state's plethora of Marauders, Diablos, Devils, Raiders,
Pirates and Rebels.</TE>
<TE>   And, for a place ostensibly governed by the people, should
California feel comfortable with such an abundance of Kings,
Emperors, Monarchs, Royals, Regents, Chancellors and Nobles but only
one Democrat (and no Republicans)?</TE>
<TE>   Schools picked ethnic nicknames, I believe, not to deride the
referenced peoples, but rather to appropriate their perceived dash,
bravery, fear-someness or exoticism (an obvious exception is
Redskins, a pejorative name given one people by another; its
equivalent would be calling the La Palma JFK Fighting Irish the
Micks, or the Venice Gondoliers the Wops).</TE>
<TE>   A minority of names look not to ethnic stereotypes, but to
something closer to home, namely, occupations associated with their
regions. Thus, the Eureka Loggers, the Hollister-San Benito
Haybalers, the Montebello Oilers and the Napa Vintage Crushers. Such
names are among the most endearing nowadays because they celebrate a
disappearing localism in an age of mass media, chain-store retailing
and national fast-food franchising.</TE>
<TE>   More often, however, the naming of high school teams has been a
kind of delinquent release from the workaday. While the majority of
California schools send their athletes into competition bearing the
names of ferocious animals and valiant fighters, not all do. Some,
through whimsy, are delinquent even from the bellicosity of the
general name-giving (bravo and Anaheim Cornelia Connelly Koalas, the
Los Olivos Dunn Earwigs, the Burroughs Burros, the Laguna Beach
Artists, the L.A. Ribet Academy Fighting Frogs).</TE>
<TE>   Getting worked up over school nicknames is a lot of wasted energy,
a futile exercise in abstraction that has nothing to do with
real-life discrimination against categories of people. Take it from
an erstwhile Crusader (Catholic Central High, Steubenville, Ohio) who
never took seriously for a moment his nominal association with that
medieval mob of inadepts, delusionals and murderous plunderers.</TE>
