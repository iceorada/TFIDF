<HD>A Large-Scale Journey</HD>
<DH>Violinist Chalifour, L.A. Philharmonic find all the drama
and complexity in Gubaidulina's wondrous 'Offertorium.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A raging chaos of a violin concerto, at once fragmented and
free-flowing, Sofia Gubaidulina's "Offertorium" (1980) grips the
listener through 35 harrowing minutes of hyperactivity.</LD>
<LD>   And the large-scale work achieved that same compelling result when
it had its Los Angeles premiere at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on
Thursday night by violinist Martin Chalifour, guest conductor Alan
Gilbert and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</LD>
<LD>   It is a wondrous piece for its integration of drama and calm, of
distraction and focus, and for the continuity of its ideas. It is
reminiscent, in its resonant tintinnabulations, of the 20th century
styles of Bartok and Messiaen, yet strikingly contemporary in its
evocation of the tinkling sounds of Asian rituals. But the fierceness
is Russian, and unmistakably Gubaidulina. Steven Stucky's pre-concert
comments rightly noted many "magic" moments in this thrilling piece,
which mesmerizes as often as it surprises.</LD>
<TE>   "Offertorium" was written for the quirky brilliance of Gidon
Kremer, yet Chalifour made it all his own with that combination of
panache, vehemence and eloquence we have come to expect. Chalifour
plays with a passion that threatens to break the instrument, yet he
achieves his musicality and deep communication with the
effortlessness he might bring to a ditty by Dancla. He is a
treasure--or have we said that before?</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert, the 35-year-old American musician, probed the depths of
this difficult, complex piece, with the sharp ears of an enthusiastic
musical partner. The orchestra collaborated brilliantly, in
particular principal cellist Andrew Shulman, who shared in the bows
at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Preceding the concerto, Gilbert led a transparent run-through of
Anton von Webern's orchestration of the Ricercata from Bach's
"Musical Offering," the theme of which is the occasion for the
variations in the Gubaidulina work.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Tchaikovsky's emotional Sixth Symphony, the
"Pathetique," turned into an anticlimax, despite a most respectable,
even brilliant, performance, led energetically by Gilbert, and
realized wholeheartedly by the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic repeats this program tonight at 8 in
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A.
$12-$78, (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>British Film Awards Seek Higher Profile</HD>
<DH>Ceremonies: BAFTA's event, moved ahead of the Oscars, has
secured a deal to be shown on a U.S. cable network.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GRITTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>In the context of movie awards ceremonies, one hesitates to use the
phrase "The British are coming!" Screenwriter Colin Welland,
brandishing his Oscar statuette for "Chariots of Fire" 20 years ago,
said just that, with a global television audience watching. The
infamous phrase would come to haunt him; it ushered in a wretched
period for British movies that lasted several years.</LD>
<LD>   But now the British really are coming--in a much different
context. This time around, it's their leading movie awards that are
making their presence felt in America.</LD>
<LD>   The British Academy of Film and Television Arts, popularly known
as BAFTA, has been handing out annual awards to home-grown and
international films since 1947. In Britain, the awards ceremony has
gained a much higher profile in recent years. But now plans are afoot
to take the British academy a stage further. BAFTA Chief Executive
Amanda Berry recently achieved a major priority--to secure an
American TV deal. E! Entertainment has agreed to carry BAFTA's annual
awards, which will be held here Sunday. (E! will broadcast the awards
next Saturday at 8 p.m., hosted by actor Stephen Fry). In future
years, Berry hopes a U.S. network may broadcast the event.</LD>
<TE>   "I think TV is a very important factor," she said. "The studios
are supportive of the event, and they realize its significance. But
the next logical step was making it available to be seen in the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   BAFTA's power brokers are aware that there is a limit to how
visible the British academy can become in America. "We'll never be as
big as the Oscars," noted BAFTA Chairman Simon Relph. But they
genuinely believe they can become recognized as a credible, informed
indicator of Oscar voting--possibly more so than the Golden Globes,
the annual awards given by members of the Hollywood Foreign Press
Assn. (Within the industry, HFPA voters have long been regarded as
susceptible to hospitality and considerations from studios promoting
movies they wish to suggest for Golden Globe awards.) "There's a
small number of them, aren't there?" said Berry of the HFPA, which
numbers fewer than 100. "But they go two months before the Oscars,
which is something I think they've been very clever about. And now
their awards ceremony is seen every year on network television."</TE>
<TE>   "One reason we have a lot of respect from the studios is that we
have 4,500 members, of whom 2,600 vote in our film awards. We are a
similar size to the American academy (which has about 5,700 members).
And every one of our voters is someone working inside the industry,
someone who has made a significant contribution."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, BAFTA's gala evening was scheduled after the
Oscars, and thus was something of an anticlimax and of little help to
the studio's Oscar marketing campaigns. Relph, a film producer whose
best-known credit in the U.S. is "Enchanted April," commented: "I
always felt we were at the tag-end of the awards season, and everyone
was exhausted. It was hard to get people to come along." There was
another problem: BAFTA's awards included both TV and films, which
made for a cumbersome, overlong ceremony, sometimes beyond four
hours.</TE>
<TE>   Those days are gone. A spirit of modernization has swept through
the British academy, and it first staged its own separate film awards
in 1998. Last year was the first year for an even more radical
experiment: The BAFTA awards were moved forward to late February, a
month before the Oscars. The switch was judged a success.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly Hollywood studios are taking a keen interest in BAFTA.
Screenings of films likely to compete for awards are organized for
them at BAFTA's well-appointed headquarters on Piccadilly, 100 yards
west of Piccadilly Circus, which houses a luxurious theater. Members
now also receive regular mailings and videotapes from studios with a
very American label attached: "for their consideration." The thinking
behind this change of mood is obvious--a BAFTA award or nomination
for a film or its actors helps legitimize its Oscar-worthiness.</TE>
<TE>   Berry, who took over the post 15 months ago, embarked on a tour of
Hollywood studios at that time along with BAFTA Vice Chairman Stephen
Woolley (who has produced such films as "The End of the Affair" and
"Interview With the Vampire") to drum up support for a February
ceremony. "There's a window in the film world where everyone focuses
on films," she said. "It starts with the Golden Globes and closes
with the Oscars. We'd separated our film and TV awards and we felt
the timing was right to move the film event pre-Oscars. We needed to
know [the studios] would support us."</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, the British academy relies on the goodwill of
Hollywood studios to add luster to its awards evening. The studios
can jet American stars to London, and their presence makes the awards
a more glittering event.</TE>
<TE>   The entreaties from Berry and Woolley paid off. "The reaction was
immediately positive," Berry said. "[The studios] wanted to support
the event. It created problems for them; we asked them to push
forward the U.K. release dates for some of their films so they could
qualify for the BAFTAs. But on the whole they were phenomenal."</TE>
<TE>   Having helped Berry win over Hollywood studios, Woolley agreed
that establishing a regular U.S. TV slot for the awards is BAFTA's
next priority: "Apart from the Golden Globes, ours is the most
important ceremony outside the American academies," he observed. "If
we have any ambition, it would be to try and position ourselves as a
better alternative than the Golden Globes. What we'd like is to be
seen as a more honest and trustworthy guide to what could well happen
in the American academy. That's where we have our biggest challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the BAFTAs carry more prestige than any awards ceremony
outside America, more so than say France's Cesars, in part because
they are viewed as more than just a strictly one-nation event. The
British academy has a section in its awards devoted to international
films and artists.</TE>
<TE>   BAFTA voters traditionally go their own way, often diverging from
choices made by Oscar voters. For example, three years ago, Peter
Weir's film "The Truman Show" won three BAFTAs but not a single
Oscar. And last year, British teenager Jamie Bell was named best
actor by BAFTA voters for his starring role in "Billy Elliot,"
beating Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe and Michael Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   But BAFTA voters do not always vote along patriotic lines: Two
years ago, they named Pedro Almodovar best director for "All About My
Mother," over British favorite (and Oscar winner) Sam Mendes for
"American Beauty."</TE>
<TE>   This year's BAFTA nominations, announced this month, confirm this
independent streak: "Moulin Rouge" and "The Lord of the Rings: The
Fellowship of the Ring" head the list of admired films with 12
nominations each. "Amelie" and "Shrek" are among the five nominees
for best film (none of which is British, though there is also a
separate category for best British film). Kevin Spacey (a huge
favorite with BAFTA members) is a best actor nominee for "The
Shipping News." Both Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith are nominated for
best supporting actress for their roles in "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   The British academy has been in existence since 1947, when it was
founded by 14 members and chaired by director David Lean ("Lawrence
of Arabia"). Most members are affiliated to its London headquarters,
but BAFTA has regional branches, including a thriving one in Los
Angeles. BAFTA/LA has some 800 members who can also vote on the
awards.</TE>

<TE>   The BAFTA awards can be seen on E! Channel, next Saturday, 8-10
p.m.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Troubador Sings for Change</HD>
<DH>Fernando Delgadillo, who has never had a recording
contract, carries on his country's Nueva Trova movement, a product of
social unrest in the '60s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Singer-songwriter Fernando Delgadillo was used to playing for small
crowds in Mexico City, the enormous metropolis where fluffy pop music
monopolizes the record industry. But an audience of two? Isn't that
taking intimacy too far, even for this bohemian troubadour who
attributes his artistic survival to never having had a recording
contract?</LD>
<LD>   No, it didn't matter to Delgadillo when only two fans showed up
five years ago to hear him play at a club on the capital's artsy
south side. The owner, on the other hand, wanted to cancel the show.</LD>
<LD>   "'Cancel? How can we cancel if they came to see me?'" the singer
of protest songs recalls protesting. "And so I sort of sat down with
the two of them, and the truth is, I had a great time. And so did
they."</LD>
<TE>   Delgadillo, who makes his U.S. debut tonight at the Museum of
Latin American Art in Long Beach, says he never saw those fans again.
But other people started coming to his concerts, referred by friends
who raved about getting a private performance from this prolific,
singing poet. Now, the others were hoping to get lucky and be the
only ones to show up for a performance.</TE>
<TE>   Those early fans wanted a private audience, he says, because they
had so many favorite songs to request. By 1999, 3,000 followers were
calling out song after song during a Delgadillo performance at a much
larger venue. The recording of the concert, distributed on two CDs by
Discos Pueblo, sizzles with lively interaction between the singer and
his excited fans, who can be heard enthusiastically singing along to
his lengthy lyrics like a happy class recital.</TE>
<TE>   "I had underestimated the power of word-of-mouth," says
Delgadillo, who's been making music for 17 years. "When people hear
you and are convinced, they try to convince others. And that is
basically what has happened to me."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo is a prime exponent of the New Song movement in Mexico,
known as Nueva Trova. The movement is no longer new, of course, since
it arose during the era of social unrest in Latin America during the
1960s. Its major exponents, such as Cuba's Silvio Rodriguez and
Chile's Inti-Illimani, expressed both rebelliousness and hope in
acoustic music that fused smart, contemporary lyrics with folkloric
forms.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo, who wasn't born until 1965, has defiantly carried the
torch in Mexico for a genre that became increasingly marginalized as
young people gave up on changing the world and turned to living la
vida loca.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, skeptics warned him people wouldn't buy songs with
so many lyrics--tanta letra. But he kept writing them. Songs about
his country's corruption and its rich ancient culture, occasionally
using pre-Hispanic indigenous instruments. Stories about serious
relationships and fanciful tales spun from everyday life, such as the
one about a popcorn fight in a movie theater.</TE>
<TE>   He calls his work Cancion Informal, "informal song," because it
doesn't lend itself to formal categories. Few compositions qualify
strictly as protest songs, but they all are grounded in a restless
search for change and honesty.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, five years before Mexican voters ousted the country's
quasi-dictatorial ruling party, Delgadillo wrote a bold indictment of
corruption called "Evoluciones." The song exposes the apathy and
inertia of citizens who become uselessly invested in the way things
are: "There's so much to change and nobody begins/ Many are afraid to
start/ They feel that somebody's just waiting for them to get out of
line/ and take their place on the way to nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   English versions of some of Delgadillo's lyrics will be projected
during tonight's performance. The songs were translated so those who
don't speak Spanish can appreciate their meaning, though often the
grace, rhythm and nuance of the original are lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the museum to become a forum for artists who don't have a
place to present themselves but who have a lot to say," says Gregorio
Luke, the museum's director.</TE>
<TE>   Serious Mexican artists are in particular need of more places to
promote their work. The Mexican entertainment industry tends to favor
pop artists based on looks or hooks, says Luke.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no options within that system, so in Mexico we have
seen a virtual exile of the truly talented," Luke says. "That's why
there is so much merit to people like Fernando Delgadillo, who have
created their own market on the margins of the record industry."</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo is the oldest of five children whose parents owned
Mexican-food restaurants. They taught Fernandito to be frugal and
save his money, traits that would help during lean years as an
artist.</TE>
<TE>   They never wanted him to be a musician, and Fernando never wanted
to be anything else. When he dropped out of college, he recalls, they
were upset and put him to work behind the counter of one of the
family eateries. Delgadillo, barely out of his teens, brought his
guitar to work and wrote songs during the lull before lunch. He first
started playing with a group named Huancayo, specializing in Andean
folk music and pro-Socialist protest songs. But his urge to write and
sing his own material led him to a solo career.</TE>
<TE>   Six feet, three inches tall and wearing boots, the singer towered
above most fellow Mexicans, looking increasingly like James Taylor as
he went bald on the top but kept his hair long on the sides. He cut a
striking figure in his barrio of Ciudad Satelite, a northern suburb
not known as an artist enclave, performing occasionally with a band
of like-minded bohemians.</TE>
<TE>   They hung banners across neighborhood streets to advertise their
concerts, and Delgadillo sold homemade cassettes of his music to fans
after the shows. Much of that early material appeared later on his
first recorded CD, "Con cierto aire a ti" (1992), also on the
independent Discos Puebla.</TE>
<TE>   Six years and four CDs later, Delgadillo performed before a
capacity audience of 3,200 at the Teatro Metropolitan. According to
his Web site (www.fdelgadillo.com.mx), he became the first
singer-songwriter to sell out the venue without major label support.
Last year, he sold out two nights at the same venue for the premiere
of his seventh and latest studio recording, "Campo de Suenos," or
Field of Dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Delgadillo, who's married to a psychologist and has three
children, keeps his family budget simple. He figures each new CD
brings in enough money to keep him going for a year and a half. "The
truth is that I started writing songs because I like writing songs,"
Delgadillo says. "All the rest of it, whatever happens with what I
like to do, those are mere consequences."</TE>

<LD>Remember those heady, romantic days in the 1980s when dedicated TV
watchers--me, for sure, and quite possibly you--were entranced by the
mating dances of Sam and Diane on "Cheers" and "Moonlighting's" Dave
and Maddie? When Capt. Frank Furillo of "Hill Street Blues" made
Schick chic when he tenderly shaved the legs of his lover, Joyce
Davenport?</LD>
<LD>   When nebbishy "L.A. Law" partner Stuart Markowitz learned the
mysterious "Venus butterfly" maneuver and won the undying ardor of
the elegant Ann Kelsey? Remember those days? They're gone.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, Niles Crane recently proposed to Daphne Moon, the longtime
object of his affections, in a heavily promoted episode of "Frasier."</LD>
<TE>   And it was done so charmingly you could almost believe that the
show's writers will be able to contrive a credible, long-term
relationship for these fundamentally improbable lovers.</TE>
<TE>   But if you look over the broader TV landscape, romance has become
a lot more complicated, even pessimistic, in the past decade.</TE>
<TE>   I got to thinking about this in part because of  a "Scrubs"
episode that followed the question-popping "Frasier."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the young "Scrubs" doctors--joke-cracking J.D. (Zach Braff)
and socially inept Elliott (Sarah Chalke)--gave in to the sexual
attraction that had been gnawing at them since the medical dramedy
debuted in October.</TE>
<TE>   They were idiotically infatuated for a week, slyly smiling at each
other across patients' beds, making out in the stairwells.</TE>
<TE>   But an ill-chosen word here, a razzing from a co-worker there, and
suddenly little things they had found endearing about each other were
about as pleasant as chewing aluminum foil. Yes, that painful.</TE>
<TE>   Comments to a psychologist by Dr. Perry Cox (William C. McGinley),
a senior physician still bruised by a bitterly failed marriage,
served as a sort of Greek chorus to J.D. and Elliott's crash and
burn. "Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in
the movies: Will they, won't they? And then they finally do and
they're happy forever. Gimme a break. Nine out of 10 of them end
because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half the
ones that get married get divorced anyway."</TE>
<TE>   There are some twosomes on TV these days who seem to escape the
undertow: Ray and Debra on "Everybody Loves Raymond"; Hal and Lois on
"Malcolm in the Middle," cartoonish though they are; Bernie and Wanda
on "The Bernie Mac Show." But most romantically inclined characters
don't get deep enough into a relationship to encounter the long-haul
obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   On "Philly," defense attorney Kathleen Maguire (Kim Delaney) is
wrangling with her ex-husband over child custody and stumbling into a
doomed affair with a judge.</TE>
<TE>   On "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," Gil Grissom (William
Petersen) and Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) look about as
likely to mate as "Law &amp; Order's" Briscoe and Green. She's still
stinging from a rotten marriage, and he's ... strange.</TE>
<TE>   On "Ally McBeal," they're more preoccupied with Ally's bizarre
motherhood--the 10-year-old product of her supposedly frozen ovum
showed up at her door--than the latest guest star (Jon Bon Jovi) to
streak through her life.</TE>
<TE>   TV today. It's enough to make a hopeless romantic break down and
rent "When Harry Met Sally" again.</TE>

<LD>Sex Ed: "I was watching Discovery channel ... and a marine biologist
said studying the sex lives of Antarctica's sea urchins may hold the
clue to understanding human fertility. I'm no scientist, but if you
want to understand human fertility, why don't you just study humans?
It's not like they're hard to find. They're having sex all the time.
Isn't it easier to find two humans having sex than a 2-inch sea
urchin under 6 feet of ice in Antarctica?" (Jay Leno)</LD>

Anderson get along so well." (Ira Lawson)</LD>

<HD>The Ardent 'Joan of Architecture'</HD>
<DH>Museums: Phyllis Lambert curates a Mies show and reflects
on designers who shaped mid-century America.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BLAIR KAMIN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>She is reportedly one of the world's richest women, but money is
hardly the only thing that sets her apart.</LD>
<LD>   She is still remembered for what she did at age 27, which was to
persuade her father, Samuel Bronfman, president of Joseph E. Seagram
&amp; Sons Corp., to drop an architect that his company already had
selected for its Manhattan headquarters. She picked Ludwig Mies van
der Rohe instead. His bronze-covered Park Avenue Seagram Building
turned out to be his signature building, an aesthetic triumph and a
world landmark.</LD>
<LD>   Now 75, still fiercely opinionated and formidably intelligent,
Phyllis Lambert was here for the opening of "Mies in America," the
traveling exhibition that she curated and that will run at the
Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art until May 26.</LD>
<TE>   Lambert recently discussed everything from her selection of Mies
to today's architectural scene. She also looked back on her own
career as a museum director, historic preservationist and champion of
the avant-garde--activities that have earned her the sobriquet "Joan
of Architecture."</TE>
<TE>   Question: You were living in Paris in 1954 when your father sent
you a clipping from Newsweek, which said that the California
architects Charles Luckman and William Pereira had been chosen to
design the Seagram Building. What was your reaction?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: I had met Mr. Luckman on the boat going over to Europe a
couple of years earlier. And I said, "That's a rotten apple." The
drawing [of the Seagram Building] was so absolutely vile.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did your father react to your protest?</TE>
<TE>   A: He said: "You come over and choose the marble."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have a hunch you didn't want to be the decorator.</TE>
<TE>   A: No. Then my mother said to my father: "Well, dearie, why don't
we have her come over and see what she can do?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q. Was Frank Lloyd Wright on your list?</TE>
<TE>   A. I never even considered Wright. To me, he was completely a 19th
century man--manifest destiny, that sort of stuff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q. So the choice came down to Mies and the Swiss-born Le
Corbusier. Why did you go with Mies?</TE>
<TE>   A. All the younger architects were always talking in terms of
Mies. I came here and I saw 860 and 880 Lake Shore Drive [Mies' steel
and glass apartment towers, finished in 1951]. It was this kind of
shock. It was so wonderfully beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: What struck you about the design?</TE>
<TE>   A: The toughness of it and the gentleness of it at the same time.
The toughness is the steel--the raw, exposed found objects. And [the
gentleness is] the proportions, the way the two buildings sat on the
travertine, the way it played as you moved around the building, and
the proportions of the steel to the glass and the curtains behind.</TE>
<TE>   You stand on that white podium at the bottom of the buildings. The
wonderful black columns come down. You have a sense of structure
about you. You're quite calm, you're quite serene. Yet you have all
these cars whizzing by. You're there, but you're away from it. That's
very strong in all of Mies' work.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: After the Seagram Building was finished, you went to
architecture school at Yale, then transferred to the Illinois
Institute of Technology and got your master's degree in architecture
in 1963. You also worked in Mies' office. What wisdom did you sop up
from the master?</TE>
<TE>   A: I had a desk in Mies' office. When he came in, I just followed
him around. You absorb so much of it the way you absorb language when
you were a child.... For example, I remember discussing with him the
space that you'd live in. I'd grown up in a vertical house [a
townhouse in Montreal]. And so I thought that was great. He said,
"No, no."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I now can't bear anything but this great, big
horizontal open space.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've been lauded for recognizing that Mies was the
architectural giant of his era. Who, in your view, are the key
architectural figures of today?</TE>
<TE>   A: There's Rem Koolhaas, and that is because he has this
incredible ability to gather tons of information and to synthesize it
to a point. There's Peter Eisenman, who is always searching for a new
way of making forms that are highly inventive.</TE>
<TE>   There's Frank Gehry. He's learned to use the computer as means of
constructing things you couldn't do without it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why has it been so difficult for Chicago to sustain the
architectural spark it had when Mies was here?</TE>
<TE>   A: One of the problems with Mies' teaching was that Mies always
said, "I want to do an architecture everybody can do." But you
couldn't [do it] because you didn't have all that in your head--you
hadn't read all those thousands of books. You didn't have that
intimate inquiry into philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   At IIT, there was no experimenting. You were taught to keep your
paper clean and all those things, like respect for materials. But you
weren't allowed to make mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've long been interested in pushing the boundaries of
contemporary architecture, but you've also championed the cause of
historic preservation. Why should the past be part of the future?</TE>
<TE>   A: You can't start from tabula rasa. If you start pulling a town
apart, it's a terrible thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   What Mies was doing [by delicately inserting his buildings into
cities] was a much more gentle and a much more interesting thing than
what Le Corbusier was doing [by advocating the demolition and
rebuilding of swaths of cities].</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: But so many people can't stand Mies' work. They think his
buildings are cold, aloof, especially compared with Wright's.</TE>
<TE>   A: What about the people who live in lofts? That's more Miesian
because of the exposed structure and free-flowing spaces. It's not
Wrightian.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Wright was famously unconcerned with problems like leaking
roofs. How did Mies deal with everyday problems in projects like the
1951 Farnsworth House, his single-story steel and glass masterpiece
in Plano?</TE>
<TE>   A: Mies was very pragmatic. But he was wonderfully naive. The
travertine [for the porch and floor of the Farnsworth House]--he said
it's a wonderful material. But he'd never tested it in this climate.
And there's mud; you take it in.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: You've devoted your life to architecture, especially by
directing the Canadian Centre for Architecture, the museum and study
center you established in 1979. Did you make the right choice?</TE>
<TE>   A: I remember Mies saying once, "There are so many ways to be an
architect." It's always been an adventure. Just working on the Mies
exhibition has been an adventure. Doing social housing in Montreal
has been an adventure. It's all part of architecture.</TE>

<HD>A Fitting Farewell for Waylon Jennings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I read many articles about Waylon Jennings last week, but Robert
Hilburn's was the most nuanced and insightful ("Tenderness in a
Country Tough Guy," Feb. 15). I have listened to his music for most
of my life and always believed that while it was the macho-posturing
songs that drew the most reaction from the crowds, it was the
sensitive, slower songs that people really listened to.</LD>
<LD>   ALONSO JASSO</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I was very touched by Robert Hilburn's article. I'm 55 years old
and grew up listening to Waylon, Willie Nelson, Buck Owens and
others. Although I rarely listen to the current "country" artists,
I've continued to frequent Waylon's old hits, and I must say I have a
strange, empty feeling with his passing.</TE>
<TE>   He was certainly his own man, a great guitar player who had a
unique and rich voice. He was a true talent and will be greatly
missed. Fortunately for his many admirers, he will live on through
his recorded music.</TE>
<TE>   RUSS SKRABLE</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I had often thought that Waylon's down-to-earth view of life plus
his enormous artistic talent would have qualified him to be the poet
laureate of America rather than the highfalutin writers we praise so
highly. Unlike most of them, Waylon captured the essence of the
average, sometimes magical, American guy as he suffers through life.
His genius, thanks to recordings, lives on.</TE>
<TE>   RALPH RISKIN</TE>
<TE>   Santa Barbara</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I once had a cat named Waylon. He was always covered with dirt,
mewed vociferously, kicked the hell out of anything that got in his
way and loved me intensely. I miss him a lot. Best cat I ever had. He
would have little use for the phony publicity that Nashville will be
cranking up over his namesake; nor will I.</TE>
<TE>   Waylon Jennings was one of the handful of greatest country artists
ever, and the country establishment dissed him for his entire career.
So let me preempt the saccharine platitudes from Music City with the
remark that Waylon was a genuine "Honky-Tonk Hero." That's all that
needs to be said.</TE>
<TE>   MICHAEL HELWIG</TE>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   in his review of the "Down From the Mountain" concert at Universal
Amphitheatre is just plain ridiculous ("Acoustic Americana," Feb.
19).</TE>
<TE>   One would think a semi-educated guy like Cromelin would be willing
to judge the concert and its content without preconceptions, but he
blathered on for several paragraphs about the "unjustified air of
self-congratulation" evinced by Bob Neuwirth, the able and wry singer
of songs chosen as master of ceremonies, who celebrated the
tremendous surge of popular response to this great music with genuine
warmth and love. Then Cromelin waxed poetic on the emphasis on female
artists being showcased, without getting the fact that this vital
music is not about a male or a female sensibility, nor is it a
vehicle for feminism--it's just a tradition that is carried by the
faithful, telling simple stories that have real emotional weight.</TE>
<TE>   Any artificial agenda attached to the music, as Cromelin feebly
attempted to do, simply falls flat on its fanny.</TE>

<LD>There's a simple solution to the barrage of ads and promos on
television: the mute button ("NBC's Promos a Sport in Themselves," by
Brian Lowry, Feb. 20). The interruptions for commercials and promos
have become so numerous and long, I can get through almost my entire
newspaper during an evening of watching television.</LD>

<LD>I saw the production of "War Letters" at the Canon Theater and I
disagree with Diane Haithman's review ("Emotion From the Front Lines
in 'War Letters,'" Feb. 19). Her observation that the "punch" of this
material has been weakened by "five long months of hideous headlines"
is, for me, more a comment on the reviewer's detached state of mind.</LD>
<LD>   On the contrary, I felt awakened to the humanity within each of
us. The acting is superb and the subtle directing, where each actor
becomes a different character, affected in a different way, in a
different time, is haunting.</LD>

<LD>In his response to the recent article about Marlon Brando's film
career, Burt Prelutsky (Letters, Feb. 16) tried to draw a comparison
with the actor to Orson Welles, claiming that "both soon lost
interest and wound up as 300-pound grotesqueries, devoting the last
30 or 40 years of their lives to overpriced cameo appearances in
lousy movies."</LD>
<LD>   The only thing Welles lost interest in was catering to the
Hollywood studio system. To the end of his life, he passionately
pursued significant projects in both theater and film despite being
constantly frustrated by the difficulty of raising money and his
unwillingness to compromise his own vision.</LD>
<LD>   In the period that Prelutsky describes, Welles devoted his
energies to films like "Othello" and the aborted "Don Quixote" and
directed major stage productions of "King Lear" and "Moby-Dick" as
well as the stage and film versions of "Chimes at Midnight." Hardly
the output of a "grotesquerie."</LD>

<LD>In spite of Bettijane Levine's implication that Allen Reid made up
the term "dog-robbers" ("Last-Minute Saves," Feb. 18), it is indeed a
military term for what Reid does.</LD>
<LD>   I was surprised that her industry sources have never seen an
utterly charming film, "The Americanization of Emily," in which James
Garner plays a dog-robber and explains the job. Tell them to rent the
movie. They won't be sorry.</LD>

<LD>Taking on the Critics</LD>
<LD>   I just wanted Leah Ollman to know that my life has been shattered
since reading her review of the exhibition of my photographs at the
Orange County Museum ("Framing Light Without Heat," Feb. 16). My wife
decided indeed I was passionless and left me; my kids decided indeed
I wasn't funny and left me; my psychiatrist decided indeed I wasn't
ironic and left me ... and my dog left when I beat her with the L.A.
Times.</LD>
<LD>   I hope that before running a review this personally devastating,
Ollman will consider what can result from such critical writing.</LD>

<TE>   The Times has again given Andre Watts a correct yet understated
review and has again treated his concerto performance as background
to a conductor ("Young Conductor Makes Strong L.A. Debut," by Daniel
Cariaga, Feb. 16). Watts deserves far more. An Andre Watts
performance is a predictably striking combination of deep
interpretative profundity and stunning technique, and this
performance of the Beethoven Fourth Piano Concerto did not
disappoint. Watts' second movement was the high point of the entire
event.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's bad enough that one of our most valuable native art forms,
American roots music, has been historically ignored, passed over and
relegated to the back bins of old music stores. But to have a
misguided modern critic such as Richard Cromelin further distort it
in his review of the "Down From the Mountain" concert at Universal
Amphitheatre is just plain ridiculous ("Acoustic Americana," Feb.
19).</TE>
<TE>   One would think a semi-educated guy like Cromelin would be willing
to judge the concert and its content without preconceptions, but he
blathered on for several paragraphs about the "unjustified air of
self-congratulation" evinced by Bob Neuwirth, the able and wry singer
of songs chosen as master of ceremonies, who celebrated the
tremendous surge of popular response to this great music with genuine
warmth and love. Then Cromelin waxed poetic on the emphasis on female
artists being showcased, without getting the fact that this vital
music is not about a male or a female sensibility, nor is it a
vehicle for feminism--it's just a tradition that is carried by the
faithful, telling simple stories that have real emotional weight.</TE>
<TE>   Any artificial agenda attached to the music, as Cromelin feebly
attempted to do, simply falls flat on its fanny.</TE>

<LD>Dance fusion seems to be rampant lately, whether it's in the realms
of flamenco, folkloric or Indian dance, as in the case of Shyamala
Moorty and Sandra Chatterjee's"Inner [di] Visions," a nine-part
program at Highways Performance Space on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired fusion, however, is another matter, something that eluded
Moorty, a master's degree candidate in dance at UCLA, but fared
better with Chatterjee, a PhD candidate in the same program. Both
women are of mixed parentage, and it was that notion that infused
their works: The two-part "2 in 1" began the evening on a misstep as
Moorty confronted her duality in "Balance of Being," presenting
traditional ballet moves with one side of her body and Indian dance
with the other. Oh, yes: One foot was bare, the other shod in a
ballet slipper. Chatterjee's more successful "Hapa," which means
"half," was fluid and graceful, accentuated with deep squats and
delicate arm work.</LD>
<LD>   Moorty's "At the Ballet," another schizoid effort, featured
Franchesca Cabrera, Dorothy Ramey, Eva Wilder and Lauren Ziminsky
displaying manic pirouettes amid much Indian head-bobbing, forcing
the fusion issue to no avail. On the other hand, Malathai Iyengar's
work "Pallavi" found Chatterjee and Moorty effectively executing fine
bharata natyam and kuchipudi-style dancing, with polyrhythmic
footwork abounding.</LD>
<TE>   Chatterjee also captivated with her "Dasi (displaced)," vamping in
tank top and plain black pants, long hair flowing, as she let loose
with a series of repetitive, Indian-based posturings. The duo
cleverly incorporated face masks (worn on the backs of their heads)
in "Like Mother Like Daughter?," which was hampered by a
cliche-ridden taped sound collage.</TE>
<TE>   Completing the program: Moorty's work, "Public Service
Announcement," featuring Matt Motal's technically plagued video; and
Moorty/Chatterjee's game show gambit, "Identity Facts I, II and III."
This amateurish, three-part piece involved the audience, where
individuals were asked to characterize their identities in one word.
This reviewer's response: why?</TE>

<TE>   "Inner [di] visions," repeats tonight at 8:30 at Highways

<LD>   A Public Glimpse Into Cobain's Diaries</LD>
<LD>   Two notebooks from the collected diaries of Kurt Cobain were made
available to select New York publishers this week by the Nirvana
singer's widow, Courtney Love, according to MTV.</LD>
<TE>   Love is said to be fielding offers to publish the late rock star's
writings, which reportedly include his early lyrical drafts for
"Smells Like Teen Spirit," his youthful reviews of punk shows and
love letters to Love. MTV quotes an unidentified source at one of the
publishing houses who estimated that seven-figure bids would be made
by month's end for the publishing rights.</TE>
<TE>   Love, the source says, is emphasizing the need for deft handling
of the book's marketing and packaging in light of the fact that
Cobain committed suicide in 1994. Love is also involved in a legal
dispute with the two surviving members of Nirvana over a proposed
boxed set of their complete recordings.</TE>
<TE>   The source went on to predict that the complete diaries could
become a landmark release. "This was an unmediated look at one of the
greatest minds of the 20th century ... there were lists of his
favorite albums, precise descriptions of what it was like to be an
addict, heartbreaking letters. This will have long-lasting value,
this will be a huge book."</TE>

<TE>   Elton John Deplores State of Music Business</TE>
<TE>   Elton John likens the new generation of pop stars, including
Britney Spears and 'N Sync, to packets of cereal. And he's fed up.</TE>
<TE>   The music industry, he says, is churning out "average and
mediocre" bands--"fodder" that damages the chance of real talent
getting air-play.</TE>
<TE>   "Nowadays, record companies want the quick buck from the
Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, Britney Spears, S Club 7, from the Steps,"
he told the British Broadcasting Corp.'s "News- night." "They've
always been around, I'm not knocking the music perhaps, but it's like
packets of cereal."</TE>
<TE>   John also came down on music videos. "If I was king of the music
business and I would do one thing, I'd close down all the video
stations and say let's just have music, can we?"</TE>

<TE>   Another Incarnation for Alice Walker Novel</TE>
<TE>   "The Color Purple," Alice Walker's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel
about a poor Southernblack woman's struggle for freedom, is being
turned into a musical.</TE>
<TE>   The material was last adapted into a 1985 movie by Steven
Spielberg, starring Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover.</TE>
<TE>   According to the New York Times, the musical will be directed by
Mathew Warchus, an Englishman responsible for revivals such as "True
West" and "Follies," from a script by actress-playwright Regina
Taylor. The music will be written by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis,
and Stephen Bray. The producers hope to bring it to Broadway in 2004.</TE>

Tenenbaums" and "Waking Life" have in common? They're all multiple
nominees in the third annual Golden Trailer Awards, taking place at
the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood on March 14.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling to the West Coast after two years in New York, the event
honors film trailers for their artistic value--as determined by
judges that include actor Ben Stiller, producer Kathleen Kennedy,
director Brett Ratner and Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers.</TE>
<TE>   The panel will select winners in 17 categories, with the top
award, given to an editor, going to the trailer that best convinces
audiences to see a not-so-great film. New this year: the "What's
Left?" award, which allows the public to vote (at
www.goldentrailer.com) for the trailer that gave away the most plot.</TE>

<TE>   Artist Takes Care of His Benefactors</TE>
<TE>   Chris Ofili, the British artist whose dung-daubed portrait of the
Virgin Mary angered religious leaders and the mayor of New York, is
coming to the aid of the elephants that supply raw material for his
art.</TE>
<TE>   The Zoological Society of London said Thursday that Ofili had
agreed to donate proceeds from the sale of one of his paintings to
elephants at the Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Dunstable, northwest
of London. Three of its elephants lived until recently at the London
Zoo and have supplied Ofili with dung for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The painting, "Triple Couple," is being offered for sale at the
Armory art fair in New York City, which runs until Monday. It's
expected to sell for at least $57,000.</TE>

<TE>   Olympic Skating Sends Ratings Soaring</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Olympic ratings were huge for NBC on Thursday
when the women's figure skating finals took place. More than 49
million people watched during the last hour--roughly double the
average audience for prime time's most-watched series, "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Based on Nielsen Media Research estimates, the network averaged
more than 42 million viewers for the night at any given minute,
second only to the opening ceremonies among the 14 nights of Winter
Olympic coverage in the books thus far.</TE>
<TE>   According to the NBC, the numbers were the best Thursday-night
ratings for any network since the series finale of "Seinfeld" in
1998.</TE>

<TE>   Networks Gear Up  for Pilot Season</TE>
<TE>   Michael Mann, who made his name with TV's "Miami Vice" and then

the small screen. He'll be collaborating with writer Barry Schindel
("Law and Order") on the pilot for a proposed L.A.-based police
series for CBS.... UPN has ordered a pilot for a new version of the
classic Rod Serling "Twilight Zone" series.... Mark Burnett, creator
of "Survivor," is developing an unscripted martial arts series. No

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Oliver Hudson, the son of Goldie Hawn and the brother of Kate
Hudson, will star in a TV series premiering on the WB network March
14, "My Guide to Becoming a Rock Star".... Dancer-choreographer Bill

<HD>The Music Isn't Live, Either</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Cold weather and a global audience require
performers to try to match recordings during the opening and closing
ceremonies.</DH>

<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Take heart, Olympic detail fiends: If the last two weeks have gotten
you in the habit of squinting at your television in search of flubbed
lutzes and leaning judges, you'll still have plenty of subtleties and
misdirection to look for in Sunday night's closing ceremonies.</LD>
<LD>   Like the performances that opened the Games on Feb. 8, the
send-off performances won't be as live as they look.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, facing a global audience and treacherous weather, the
producers and headliners will be relying on recordings to bolster
performances on a bill that includes 'N Sync, Harry Connick Jr.,
Gloria Estefan, Christina Aguilera, Bon Jovi, Dianne Reeves, Earth
Wind &amp; Fire and dancer Savion Glover, along with a few surprises.</LD>
<TE>   "There are some people who are electing to do things live, but I
haven't heard yet if we're going to let them," said a spokeswoman for
Don Mischer, the executive producer of the ceremonies. "The weather
will obviously play a role."</TE>
<TE>   The opening ceremonies, watched by an estimated 45.6 million
viewers in the U.S. and 3.5 billion worldwide, featured bow-syncing
by the Utah Symphony Orchestra and Yo-Yo Ma, and lip-syncing by the
Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Sting and others. Producers and participants
said performers were singing and playing over recordings of
themselves made weeks or months before.</TE>
<TE>   The not-quite-live nature of these performances has been something
of an open secret. Officials at the Utah Symphony, in fact, discussed
the arrangements in public interviews before the Games. Mischer told
reporters that "we feel it's important to have the orchestra and
choir on stage, but it's most important that the sound be good around
the world. Music is more or less the soul of the ceremonies."</TE>
<TE>   For West Coast viewers, the rest of the Games haven't been
entirely spontaneous either. Despite the word "LIVE" appearing
frequently in the upper-left-hand corner of NBC's screen, most
Olympic events have been tape-delayed to reach viewers during
prime-time hours here. The network acknowledges that with a second
superimposed footnote: "Recorded live from a previous broadcast."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's likely that millions of viewers have been imagining
more spontaneity than they've actually seen. The Games' broadcaster,
NBC, has contributed to that. On Jan. 15, for instance, the "Today"
show featured an interview with Olympics theme music composer John
Williams, and co-host Matt Lauer signed off by saying first that
Williams' Olympics-commissioned composition, "Call of the Champions,"
was on a CD available in stores, and then that the piece "will be
performed live on Feb. 8th during the opening ceremonies."</TE>
<TE>   What Lauer didn't say is that without the recording, the Feb. 8
show would have been impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something that we'd do in any circumstances other than
this," said David Green, orchestra manager for the Utah Symphony,
noting that temperatures on the field were around 20 degrees on the
night of the opening ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   "None of the musicians would even entertain the idea of putting
their instruments out of doors in that weather," said Green.</TE>
<TE>   In those temperatures, fingers soon lose their nimbleness, wood
warps or cracks and strings quickly slip out of tune. Fifty-six of
the orchestra's 83 musicians play stringed instruments.</TE>
<TE>   So Mischer's production company came up with a way to make it
work: Mischer would provide a disposable set of instruments, which
after the show would be given to Utah schools, and it would outfit
the orchestra members for the cold--from sweaters to scarves to hats
to gloves to silk underwear, Green said.</TE>
<TE>   From the pre-Olympic recording sessions in November and January to
the performance at Rice-Eccles Olympic Stadium, "it's been an
educational experience," said Keith Lockhart, the music director of
the Utah Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart has also served as conductor for the Boston Pops since
1995. He noted that on Feb. 3, when he directed the Boston
orchestra's pregame performance at the Super Bowl in New Orleans--a
room-temperature gig in the Louisiana Superdome--the producers and
players had the same prerecorded setup in place.</TE>
<TE>   Basically, said Lockhart, he's learned that "any time this sort of
thing happens, it's done this way." And when the temperature is below
freezing, he added, there's no real choice: "Orchestral instruments
don't function when it's 25 degrees."</TE>
<TE>   As for the needling references he's heard to the Milli Vanilli
lip-syncing scandal of 1990, Lockhart said there's no parallel
because "everything that was recorded, we played."</TE>
<TE>   In the Milli Vanilli controversy, the pop band's frontmen, Rob
Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan, and their German producer Frank Farian
admitted that the duo never sang a note on their "Girl You Know It's
True" album, which sold 10 million copies, or in concert. In a 1992
move to settle a consumer lawsuit, the duo's record company, Arista,
agreed to give partial refunds to fans who bought recordings and
attended concerts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playing Live Along With Recorded Soundtrack</TE>
<TE>   One of eeriest aspects of the Olympic adventure, Green said, was
sitting amid the musicians during their quasi-performance, hearing
genuinely live instrumental sounds around him while the full recorded
soundtrack echoed through the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat right in the orchestra," Green said. "And they were very
caught up in the experience of it all, and they did play. They either
followed the conductor closely or wore headsets. You could hear some
instruments stick out, because the strings really get swallowed up.
You could definitely hear the percussions and the brass. It was like
an orchestra that wasn't well-balanced.... I think the world would
have looked at the Utah Symphony pretty sadly, had we not
prerecorded."</TE>
<TE>   In the offices of the 360-voice Mormon Tabernacle Choir, spokesman
Randy Riplinger said those singers "have many times prerecorded and
sung over the top of it." Among the occasions: presidential
inaugurals, Utah Jazz basketball games and church productions at the
21,000-seat Conference Center in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   But not every performer in Salt Lake was well-versed in these
subtleties. When dancer Glover landed a spot in the closing
ceremonies, the producers surprised him by insisting that he
prerecord a "tap track" and dance along to it, instead of creating
the sounds live.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never done that before, I always improvise my solos," Glover
told The Times. "But now I have to choreograph a routine and stick to
it."</TE>
<TE>   Word of the prerecorded performances has provoked no particular
outcry in Salt Lake City, although the subject was raised in a Feb.
19 letter to the editor of the Salt Lake City Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   In that note, reader Bill Bynum complained that at the opening
ceremonies, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's performance of Williams'
composition also included the voices of the child choristers of the
Madeleine Choir School, "who had recorded the song earlier with the
Tabernacle Choir and the Utah Symphony" but were not invited to
appear in the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the letter writer suggested, the event's organizers
believe "that children should be heard but not seen."</TE>

<HD>Sharing Their Vision</HD>
<DH>In an unusual collaboration, cellist and dancer push aside
the traditional barriers that separate music from movement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The oldest, most basic relationship in dance is between music and
movement, and most performers leave it unquestioned.</LD>
<LD>   Not so American cellist Walter Haman and Venezuelan modern dancer
Jose Navas.</LD>
<LD>   In their two-part collaboration Haman/Navas Project, presented by
Navas' Compagnie Flak (based in Montreal) at the Skirball Cultural
Center on Thursday, these artists explored unusual connections and
modes of shared expression that gave their performance great intimacy
and immediacy.</LD>
<TE>   The small, dark, nervy Navas and the tall, blond, reserved Haman
started their 40-minute duet at the far end of the stage space, both
dressed in black.</TE>
<TE>   Navas began in profile, executing slow-motion walks, while Haman,
seated but not playing, faced away from the audience.</TE>
<TE>   As the room darkened and Navas began restlessly rolling and
stretching on the floor, the silence of the room and isolation of the
dancer loomed larger than anything specific in the movement.</TE>
<TE>   Finally Haman began playing Allan Hovhaness' "Yakamochi," a suite
of many moods and kinds of attack.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the range of the music often seemed greater than that of
the dancing.</TE>
<TE>   For all his supple, intuitive power as a dancer, Navas always
seemed driven by windblown arms and not always as compelling in his
development of steps as in his use of the upper limbs and torso.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the piece, after Haman moved his chair to face front,
Navas stood behind him, covering the cellist's eyes with one hand and
touching his chest with the other during a fast, turbulent piece
played with almost contemptuous exactitude.</TE>
<TE>   This startling tableau--the dancer immobile, his own eyes closed,
the musician furiously active despite the invasion of his
space--shattered the customary separate-but-equal politesse of music
and dance, replacing it with a shared meditative union.</TE>
<TE>   From this moment on, the interplay between Haman and Navas took
many forms, from the dancer circling the cellist while chattering
rapidly in Spanish about a Caracas earthquake to the cellist
mirroring, in miniature, the dancer's onstage costume change by
removing his own shoes and socks.</TE>
<TE>   Haman's eyes intently followed Navas during the piece's second
half, in which Benjamin Britten's Suite for Cello set formidable
technical challenges for the musician and propelled the dancer
through increasingly bold movement patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting by Marc Parent sometimes left one or the other briefly in
silhouette but most often made their artistic interdependence a
small, bright exception to the surrounding darkness.</TE>
<TE>   At the end, racing figurations on Haman's cello inspired Navas'
dramatic turns on the floor with arms flung overhead: a last
exhilarating statement of something deeper and more mysterious than
mere collaborative excellence: a sense, perhaps, that each artist had
completed the other's vision.</TE>

<HD>Hannibal Lectures</HD>
<DH>Anthony Hopkins, who is reprising his famous role in the
upcoming 'Red Dragon,' teaches on Saturday mornings at an acting
class in Santa Monica. His price: coffee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The volunteer teacher at the Ruskin School of Acting in Santa Monica
contemplated two acting students doing their first perfunctory
performance of a scene from "Macbeth."</LD>
<LD>   As soon as they finished, he jumped in with his distinctive Welsh
baritone: aristocratic, playful, intense and kind. "Let's try this
... " and then "Take your time ... " and later, "Once more. Be
patient."</LD>
<LD>   Two dozen tries later, David DeSimone was huddled in a chair,
howling at the pain of existence; April Beyer was smiling
malevolently, a woman obsessed. "This is great. This is terrific,"
the teacher said.</LD>
<TE>   Then he asked them to try it half a dozen times more.</TE>
<TE>   Lunchtime came and went. None of the 40 students left, preferring
to see whatever Anthony Hopkins would say or do next.</TE>
<TE>   When they enrolled, the students, whose class is a small
industrial space in the Santa Monica Airport, never imagined they
would be learning from one of the world's most celebrated actors.
Last September, student Marilyn Anderson, an acquaintance of Hopkins,
asked the star if he would talk to the class. He did, and he has
returned most Saturday mornings since then to lecture, demonstrate,
advise on scenes and talk about his life and craft.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they love me because I'm the one who brought him in,"
Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   It is rare for an actor of Hopkins' stature, at the top of his
career, to offer his services to a new generation of actors. "I've
never heard of it," said John Ruskin, the school's founder. "That's
part of what makes it so amazing. He could be doing anything he
wants, and he's offering himself to our school and our students."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins said all he wants in return is a cup of coffee. He enjoys
himself, he said, and not just because he's "giving back."</TE>
<TE>   "That's too Mother Teresa for me," he said. "It's a wonderful
feeling to see somebody suddenly opening up.... I feel I have an
intuitive thing about actors, especially younger actors. And I feel I
can help out a bit and give encouragement because it's a tough
business."</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly cynical about the harsher or more pompous aspects of
professional acting, Hopkins has had his own tempestuous run-ins with
directors and teachers. He sees his task as a teacher mainly as
helping students relax. "I want to make sure they feel comfortable,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   No matter students have talent, he said, "I have to treat people
with courtesy and respect. The whole point of this exercise is to
respect people's gifts, to respect what they can do, to respect their
courage."</TE>
<TE>   At 64, the actor is unexpectedly tall and muscular, formal enough
to wear a sport coat to class, casual enough to wear his loafers
without socks. He has a friendly, unpretentious air marked by
exuberant gesturing and quick sentences, coupled with a reserve
bordering on shyness.</TE>
<TE>   Known as a veteran actor of the no-nonsense British type, Hopkins
has acted in 50 films and an equal number of television projects,
plus stage performances and stints as a composer or director.</TE>
<TE>   He's won many of the world's top acting prizes and was knighted by
Queen Elizabeth in 1993, but he has also been chided for choosing
projects beneath his talent, such as "A Change of Seasons" (1980)
with Bo Derek. ("Everyone makes mistakes," he told the class
sheepishly.)</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins will soon be appearing in the comedy "Bad Company" with
Chris Rock and has another film scheduled for release later this
year, "The Human Stain," with Nicole Kidman. (The film will have some
"raunchy" scenes in which he will appear nude, he said.)</TE>
<TE>   He's now filming "Red Dragon," reprising his most famous role,
that of killer-psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter, for which he won an
Oscar in "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991). He was nominated again
for best actor for performances as a repressed English butler in "The
Remains of the Day" (1993) and for the title role in "Nixon" (1995).</TE>
<TE>   Ruskin said he so idolized Hopkins that he feared meeting him
would be a letdown. In fact, he said, "I was more in awe of him as I
got to be around him."</TE>
<TE>   Ruskin, an apprentice of the late Sanford Meisner, the influential
director of the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New
York, established his acting school 15 years ago. Meisner taught his
acting technique, which aims to replace thinking with visceral
responses, to thousands of actors, including Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Steve McQueen and Grace Kelly.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica school has about 115 students and is forming a
nonprofit company, the Parnassus Group Theatre, which will stage
performances and offer free classes and tickets to underprivileged
students. Hopkins has also offered to direct a company production
this fall at Theatre Palisades in Pacific Palisades, Ruskin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday students have completed the basic two-year course, in
which they are taught to observe their own and their fellow actors'
emotional lives, and now attend a master class. Most are in their 20s
and 30s. A few are full-time actors or aspiring professional actors,
but some are interested mainly in personal development. Many hold day
jobs that range from bartender to bookkeeper to substance-abuse
counselor.</TE>
<TE>   Beyer, 30, an improv actor who also helps run a matchmaking
company, said that if students sound gushy about Hopkins, it's not
just because he's a star and a world-class talent. What the students
most admire about Hopkins is that he has so thoroughly explored his
inner geography that he radiates a delighted acceptance of the
terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins has shared parts of his personal life, his previous
struggle with alcoholism, for instance, and his lonely, depressed
childhood in Wales.</TE>
<TE>   He's told them about his continual efforts to keep his ego in
check and how he locates and controls his emotions in a scene.</TE>
<TE>   Student Cass Allen, a physical therapist, said Hopkins showed her
a part of herself she didn't know was there. She was playing the part
of the deaf girl in "Children of a Lesser God," a role that required
a confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   "I already felt really confrontational for me," she said. "He
said, 'Do you mind?' to my scene partner," stepped into the scene and
then physically restrained Allen.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I want you to try to get free in this part and let
yourself go.'</TE>
<TE>   "He knew from his experience, which he was sharing with me, that
if there was a constraint like that, I could go to a place of anger
and rage....</TE>
<TE>   "Afterward, he was saying, 'It's fun! It's fun to go to that
terrifying place!'"</TE>
<TE>   In the dim classroom-stage decorated with holiday lights, Hopkins
sipped a cup of coffee. Ignoring the buzz of a small plane, he
instructed his students not to take him too seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Acting isn't something he fully understands, insisted Hopkins, who
was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and understudied
Laurence Olivier at London's National Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   It's just something he does.</TE>
<TE>   Acting in Hollywood is all about casting, he told them. "If you
cast a movie well [half-beat, smile], no acting required!"</TE>
<TE>   Among his insights about art and life:</TE>
<TE>   * Actors should know their lines by heart because the text is all
the information they have. For his movies, he said, he will read a
scene 200 times at home, out loud.</TE>
<TE>   * Stillness is more powerful than movement.</TE>
<TE>   * Doubt is good. Certainty is fascism. Absolute knowledge is
insanity.</TE>
<TE>   * Many actors have self-destructive tendencies. Those who succumb,
such as Marilyn Monroe or James Dean, don't have people to protect
them, nor do they protect themselves.</TE>
<TE>   * Ego is an actor's worst enemy.</TE>
<TE>   * Most of it is luck.</TE>
<TE>   To demonstrate some of his points, he sat down at a table on the
stage and performed a monologue from "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf." Hopkins apologized in advance in case the exercise appeared
to be an ego trip. "Indulge!" the students cried.</TE>
<TE>   As he started to speak, it wasn't immediately clear whether he was
acting or just reminiscing. His audience seemed hypnotized.</TE>
<TE>   After class, Hopkins chatted amiably with the students and made
arrangements to meet some later. Then, taking a seat on a couch, he
fielded some interview questions with short answers, which he
instantly revised.</TE>
<TE>   Waving off the students' praise, he said, "I'm not that humble.
I've got my ambitions. Or I used to have. I don't have any. I just
enjoy my life. If you have too much humility, you can't work."</TE>
<TE>   He can be quite tough on actors who don't know their lines and on
directors who try to manipulate him, he said. "Directors are
wonderful. I enjoy the process. I'm not saying this to be falsely
modest. I'm always risking. I hope they haven't found out yet I don't
know what I'm doing."</TE>
<TE>   Hopkins said he finds it moving to work with actors, no matter how
young they are, to help them strip away what is nonessential and
"wrinkle out their sense of sadness."</TE>
<TE>   In directing the students performing "Macbeth" and in most of his
teaching, what he wants the actors to understand is that underneath
all great dramatic art--from tragedies like "Macbeth" to Woody Allen
comedies--is the recognition that "one day we will have to depart
this realm of life. Everything is one long farewell all the time.</TE>
<TE>   "They will understand it," he said, "when they get older."</TE>

<HD>Foxx Fires Up His Stand-Up Self</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jamie Foxx, riding high on a steady string of high-profile movie
roles, returns to his stand-up roots tonight with his first HBO
comedy special in eight years, "I Might Need Security" (10:15 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   A graduate of TV's "In Living Color," the 34-year-old Foxx has
enhanced his marquee value by co-starring in such recent films as the
Oscar-nominated "Ali," "Any Given Sunday" and "Booty Call."</LD>
<LD>   In tonight's program, he hits the stage running, revving up the
audience at Oakland's Paramount Theater with an old-school
call-and-response rap and a generous flash of his famously sculpted
abs. As winner of the Bay Area Black Comedy Competition more than a
decade ago, Foxx gets a welcome-back reception worthy of a conquering
hero. But the hourlong performance that follows works a bit harder at
maintaining the energy than the focus.</LD>
<TE>   Foxx offers profanity-driven insights on post-9/11 America that
hit the mark more often than not, and then it's celebrity-skewering
time. Refreshingly oblivious to whatever show-biz bridges he might be
burning, Foxx runs through and runs down a who's who list of
notables, including Whitney Houston ("I'm not saying she's a
crackhead, but she's crack-ish"), Michael Jackson, O.J. Simpsonand
Jennifer Lopez.</TE>
<TE>   Comments on a well-publicized scuffle with "Any Given Sunday"
co-star LL Cool J are remarkable in their candor ("He hit me into
another movie," admits Foxx), as are his confessions on a meeting
with Prince.</TE>
<TE>   The special tends to flatten out thereafter, including a segment
on filming "Ali" in Africa that presents observations similar to and
more crisply conceived years ago by Richard Pryor in the concert film
"Live on the Sunset Strip."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Foxx's return to stand-up is a welcome one, and his
next trip onstage just might prove as well-honed as those abs.</TE>

<HD>Olympic Ideal Will Skate Past Scandal</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will the 2002 Winter Olympic Games be best remembered for feats of
athleticism or what's become known as "Skategate?" A French judge
said she had been pressured into awarding the Russian pairs figure
skating team the gold medal over the team from Canada. In a
post-competition resolution of the controversy, the Canadian pair
received duplicate gold medals.</LD>
<LD>   MARY REESE BOYKIN spoke with a former Olympian about the scandal.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   WYOMIA TYUS</TE>
<TE>   Former U.S. sprinter, relay team member; winner of three gold
medals in the 1964 and 1968 Olympics</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the judges have done a great job. But I don't
think it is the first time a judge has rendered the wrong decision.
Maybe it's the first time that an official was caught. The panel of
nine judges was wise in righting a wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Will Olympic committees go back and correct other wrongs? In 1988,
many felt that boxer Roy Jones Jr. earned the gold rather than the
silver.</TE>
<TE>   In figure skating, judging can be subjective, since so much
depends on where the judges' values are.</TE>
<TE>   I remember watching a black French skater who brought something
different to the sport.</TE>
<TE>   Comments made about her were that she was ungraceful, too
athletic.</TE>
<TE>   How level was the playing field for her?</TE>
<TE>   While this incident does not tarnish the Olympics--one bad
decision can't bring down the Olympics--it will make judges more
accountable.</TE>
<TE>   They will pay closer attention to the particulars of athletes'
performances.</TE>
<TE>   They must demonstrate integrity, regardless of national pride.</TE>
<TE>   The judges will also realize that, whether their decisions are
popular or unpopular, they must stand up for what they believe.</TE>
<TE>   They must feel comfortable with their decision.</TE>
<TE>   In this day, winning a gold medal can be a paycheck for life. The
athlete who has strived hard and won should not be denied the honor.</TE>

<LD>In his State of the Union speech, President Bush challenged Americans
to contribute at least 4,000 hours to volunteer efforts over the
course of their lifetimes. SAMANTHA and BARBARA MACLAREN spoke with
student volunteers about the president's message and why they chose
to donate their time.</LD>

<TE>   I volunteer as a candy striper at Huntington Memorial Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   I work in different departments, sometimes I answer phones and do
paperwork. I also get patients food or blankets. I do
errands--escorting patients to their rooms and delivering flowers.</TE>
<TE>   I have been volunteering since the beginning of last summer. I do
it because it makes me feel like I'm making a difference in people's
lives. I want to work in the medical field, and this is allowing me
to get a feel for things.</TE>
<TE>   I think that President Bush is right in calling upon people to
volunteer. If people gave something back to their communities, it
would eliminate many of society's problems.</TE>
<TE>   I encourage others, such as my friends, to volunteer. The main
reason that people don't volunteer is they think they don't have the
time or that they won't make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Some organizations would get more volunteers if they went to
schools and let it be known that they need them.</TE>
<TE>   They might even target teens who are in trouble; maybe it could
change their life by trying to help others.</TE>
<TE>   People can learn many things from volunteering. They can learn
that even the smallest things they do in life--like smiling at
someone or just bothering to make sure that they're doing all right
or that the person has what they're looking for--could make a
person's day much better.</TE>
<TE>   Just that one thing can be worth a whole lot to that other person.</TE>

<TE>   I have been a volunteer for the American Cancer Society, Mobility
is Freedom , Antelope Valley Hospital, Palmdale Youth Soccer League,
Palmdale Youth Cheerleaders, and the Antelope Valley Senior Expo.</TE>
<TE>   The first place I volunteered for was the American Cancer Society.
It was an opportunity given through the medical magnet program at
Palmdale High School. I had always wanted to volunteer but I didn't
know how to get involved; this was a perfect opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteering, for me, has been very fulfilling. It makes me feel
like I actually have an impact on somebody's life. It allows me to do
something that I can really feel good about.</TE>
<TE>   You're only one person, but through volunteering I have learned I
can make a difference. I don't think people know what a satisfying
experience volunteering is.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has a busy life. But you don't have to put in a 40-hour
week as a volunteer to make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   You can volunteer in so many different ways.</TE>
<TE>   If you have a hobby or an interest you can volunteer to share
that.</TE>
<TE>   If you like working with animals, you can volunteer at an animal
shelter or kennel.</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, giving time is better than giving money. If you
have the money and you want to donate it, that's great, it will help
out a lot. But for those who do not have money to spare, volunteering
is an excellent way to help the community.</TE>
<TE>   It has made me a lot more grateful for what I have. I have been
able to meet a lot of great people, people whom I really admire. It
has given me real world experience. It has made me appreciate a lot
more things, and it just changed me as a person.</TE>

<TE>   I started volunteering at Carousel Ranch in Santa Clarita about
four months ago. I was taking a class and part of the course was to
volunteer somewhere. I picked Carousel Ranch because I want to be a
veterinarian and I really like horses.</TE>
<TE>   Carousel Ranch works with disabled children, getting them on
specially trained horses. I like the hands-on experience this gives
me.</TE>
<TE>   When you first go, you're really not looking forward to it because
you know it's volunteering and you don't get paid for it. It really
turns out for your benefit because you learn a lot.</TE>
<TE>   I have gotten some friends to go out there and volunteer with me,
and they really liked it because they felt better about themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Most people don't volunteer because they are interested in earning
money. But what you earn as a volunteer can be greater than the money
you would have made working at a paid job.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why has Gov. Gray Davis made abortion a key issue in his campaign
against Richard Riordan? This is just a smoke screen to cloud over
the real issues for which he has no solutions. Riordan has said that
he will abide by existing laws. So, why can't we have a campaign
based on the real issues? There certainly are enough of them.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Bernstein</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Can anyone imagine Democrats voting for a Democratic politician
who was against abortion, against gun control, against gay marriages
and gave big donations to Republican candidates? It would never
happen because, as diverse as the Democratic Party is, there are some
core values almost all of them agree on.</TE>
<TE>   So how could any Republican consider voting for Riordan? The man
is everything the Republican Party is not: He supports abortion (even
if he doesn't like it personally), he supports gun control, he
welcomes the gay lifestyle and he has made huge contributions to
Democratic candidates--which means the opposing Republican candidate
didn't get his financial support. I ask all my fellow Republicans to
vote for either Bill Jones or Bill Simon. It is much better for the
California Republican Party to lose with dignity than win with
disgrace. Riordan can call himself whatever he wants, but he is not a
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Robert M. Brickson</TE>
<TE>   Corona del Mar</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When I watched the recent gubernatorial debate in San Jose I was
saddened by the statements of the GOP's team of conservative Bills
(Simon and Jones). They both stated that the Republican Party didn't
have to apologize to women when we know clearly that many women have
left the Republican Party because they didn't feel they have a voice.
Every election cycle the California GOP throws up the same slate of
conservative candidates that are out of touch with women and the
broad electorate of California. The result being that every election
year major GOP candidates in California go down in defeat to the
Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that Riordan is the right person for the job of governor
of California because he can bring many groups of people together
across this state, like no other political leader we have had in a
long time, and bring the women's vote back to the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   David Shaneyfelt</TE>
<TE>   Garden Grove</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   According to Andrew Escobar (letter, Feb. 16), "The true heart and
soul of any political party is to win elections." He asks, "What use
are rhetoric and ideology when they cannot be implemented through the
election of public officials?" Obviously, a party cannot accomplish
anything if it doesn't get candidates elected. But it's not
either-or. A party needs both beliefs and election power. To ignore
the supporting ideology is a subversion of the political process. We
already have too many politicians (we each have our own list) to whom
getting elected is the only thing that matters. But I turn his
question around and ask: "What use is getting elected when there is
no clear ideology?"</TE>
<TE>   Any political party must of necessity combine and compromise the
various beliefs of the individual party members. The Republican Party
has a particularly hard job because it has combined so many extreme
views: anti-abortionists, the religious right, the gun lobby, etc.,
and in the meantime there is very little that is truly of general
interest to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   The true heart and soul of a political party consists of the
underlying beliefs and ideology of its members. Yes, the party must
be elected to enough offices to survive. And yes, voting for ideology
alone can lead to the "Nader effect," which serves no real purpose
except as an object lesson. Rally around Riordan if you like. I will
decide later how to vote.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jones seems to think that women, particularly Nancy Daly
Riordan, should be controlled by their husbands as to how they should
think and vote. Riordan knows that when women are at the table,
policy formation is strengthened. He gets my vote in the Republican
primary.</TE>

<LD>Re "Why Reward Iran's Zealots?" Opinion, Feb. 17: Nikki R. Keddie
shares the view of most people outside the U.S. when she describes as
bizarre President Bush's inclusion of Iran in his "axis of evil"
speech. Not long ago the U.S. was praising Iran for offering its
cooperation in Afghanistan. When it became apparent that the Taliban
and Al Qaeda were on the run, Washington not only reverted to form
but upped the stakes by using fundamentalist language that would put
a hard-line cleric to shame.</LD>
<LD>   A Persian proverb tells of the peasant who loses his fear of God
once his overladen pack animal has crossed a rickety bridge. George
Bush Sr. behaved in a similar manner at the time of the Persian Gulf
War, when he promised much to Tehran before hostilities had begun and
delivered little after Saddam Hussein was defeated.</LD>
<LD>   America sees it as a right to go halfway around the world to bomb
Afghanistan and introduce sweeping changes, including the
establishment of military bases that could be seen as a threat by
others in the region. Yet Iran is castigated when trying to protect
its interests in a neighboring country with which it shares a porous
550-mile border. Listening to Vice President Cheney and Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, one may be excused for thinking that
arrogance had replaced statesmanship in Washington. Maybe a single
superpower was not such a good idea after all.</LD>
<TE>   Kewmars Bozorgmehr</TE>
<TE>   London</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Once again, history repeats itself. Bush's belligerent speech and
saber-rattling remind me of the 1950s, when Dwight D. Eisenhower was
president and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles engaged in what
was then called brinkmanship. While traveling in Europe in 1958, I
was told by a fellow passenger from England that, while they really
did like Americans, they were very worried by Dulles' doings. I had
to assure him that we did not all agree with Dulles, et al., but were
doing our best to change things to a policy of peace. Now, reading
what our European friends think of us, I am once more embarrassed
that our president is making us look so arrogant and dangerous in the
eyes of the world.</TE>
<TE>   Julie May</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The news is raising my blood pressure these days. First, I'm
appalled at the Bush administration's arrogant expansion of a much
narrower mission and wonder why no citizens or members of Congress
are speaking out about it. Have we been blinded by patriotic revenge
for 9/11? I supported the invasion of Afghanistan and the pursuit of
Al Qaeda but don't support, without further evidence of imminent
threat, this hawkish stance with regard to the so-labeled "axis of
evil." We need to motivate the U.N. to renew inspections in Iraq, and
elsewhere if needed, but I don't believe we'll get international
support by "declaring war" on sovereign nations without provocation
or adequate justification.</TE>
<TE>   Second, I'm flabbergasted at the audacity of saying that to
restrict campaign contributions is to limit free speech. Paid-for
speech, in the first place, is not free and, second, this theory
means that the more money I have at my disposal, the more "free
speech" to which I am entitled, making any notion of equality under
the law ludicrous. Government for the people becomes government for
the wealthy and moneyed organizations like Enron, whose voices get
heard and drown out all other voices.</TE>

<TE>   Re Robert Scheer's Feb. 19 column, "Making Money, the Bush Way":
It appears that the Desert Storm military action was a ruse to
protect the Saudis, the Carlyle Group and especially the oil
interests. Hussein was forgotten after these objectives were
accomplished. He's still around, and we are still facing this
problem--to the delight of the military interests.</TE>
<TE>   The people who are part of the Carlyle Group read like the friends
of Bush Sr. and Bush Jr.--military interests, oil interests--they are
one and the same. The only interests they have are money, profits and
power. The people do not seem to matter. Too bad for the American
people that Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. are part and parcel of this group.</TE>

<HD>Bringing the Cinerama Dome Into Focus</HD>

<LD>Re "Big Screen Furor-Rama in Hollywood," Feb. 19: As one of the "film
industry professionals and serious movie buffs" (former film editor
and screenwriter, current film history professor) The Times mentions
as being engaged in the Cinerama Dome renovation controversy, I come
down rectangularly on the side of those favoring some variation on a
flat or louvered screen as opposed to the planned solid-sheet curved
screen. The latter will almost certainly create distortion and other
technical problems unbefitting any major theater, but especially one
aspiring to the experiential uniqueness and technological excellence
of the Cinerama Dome. "Cutting-edge" should not mean cutting corners.</LD>

<TE>   As a film editor who has spent countless hours enjoying films at
the Cinerama Dome, I am thrilled that its restoration is approaching
completion. But I am chagrined over Pacific Theatres' reluctance to
address and correct the inherent focus problems that have long
plagued the venue. Even with a brighter lamp-house, a nonlenticular
"smooth sheet" screen may display even more focus reflectance than
previous screens, resulting in an image that seems more washed out
and less defined.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, by failing to lower the center projection booth, the
image distortion (or keystoning) that has always plagued the Dome
will most likely continue. In the article, no representatives of
Pacific Theatres ever stated that they had come up with an alternate
approach to rectify this. So how exactly is precise focus to be
achieved?</TE>
<TE>   Mark Goldblatt</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is a tried and proven fact in motion picture projection that a
louvered movie screen is required to minimize fogging from cross
reflection when projecting Cinerama and other film formats on a
deep-curved screen. What a regretful situation that Los Angeles
moviegoers will experience a compromised presentation should a solid
screen be used at the renovated Cinerama Dome.</TE>
<TE>   Solid sound screens vibrate profusely with high-powered subwoofer
systems behind them. A louvered screen would vibrate less, as the
space between the louvers will remove resistance to the sound. The
louvered screen material is also perforated to let the sound through
with minimal vibration.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the Cinerama in Seattle and the Bradford Museum of Film
(United Kingdom) have successfully used louvered screens for Cinerama
and other film presentations, all with high-powered sound systems.</TE>

<HD>Richman's Bills Address Doctors' HMO Woes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many observers lament that successful people are hesitant to suspend
their careers and dedicate themselves to public service. As someone
who set aside his medical practice and is under attack for trying to
end HMO abuses, I now understand why.</LD>
<LD>   "Lawmaker's Bills Would Have Benefited His Firm" (Feb. 15) fails
to explain the complex ways that HMOs squeeze medical providers and
deny access to quality patient care. Despite the critics' most
self-serving interpretations, AB 1600 and AB 142 provide no financial
gain to me. AB 1600 creates a dispute resolution process for patients
and medical providers to get regulatory relief from HMO contracts
that violate state fairness laws. AB 142 would have required health
plans, rather than medical groups, to pay for injectable medications,
preventing the ethical dilemma that doctors might face in deciding
whether to prescribe drugs that can cost up to $5,000 per dose.
Moreover, the Legislature's ethics attorney has repeatedly confirmed
that there is absolutely no legal or ethical problem with my
legislative involvement in these HMO reform issues.</LD>
<LD>   It does not surprise me that my efforts to end HMO abuses have
generated strong opposition and desperate tactics. What may surprise
some is that fending off this baseless attack has strengthened this
citizen legislator's resolve and increased public support for these
important reforms.</LD>

<HD>Legislators' Terms: Voters Have Their Limits</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your editorial in support of Proposition 45 (''Easing the Term Limits
Box,'' Feb. 17) fails to provide even one specific instance of harm
to the state caused by term limits. If term limits are the disaster
you claim them to be, giving one factual cause-effect example
shouldn't be that difficult.</LD>
<LD>   But the real story of term limits, one I have yet to see addressed
anywhere, is my inability as a voter to have any impact on the career
of a state-level politician outside of my voting district, regardless
of the impact he or she may have on me.</LD>
<LD>   When [former Assembly Speaker] Willie Brown was in office he had a
great impact on policies that affected us in Los Angeles, but we had
no ability to influence either his thinking or his tenure through the
ballot box. As long as he provided the pork in his district, he was
assured reelection. And the longer he remained in office the more
pork-power he accumulated and the more dictatorial he became. Term
limits changed that. For the better.</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 45 will effectively abolish term limits because there
is absolutely no doubt that Brown and others like him will be able to
gather the required signatures to run for office again. A better
alternative to Proposition 45 would be to allow incumbents to run for
a term beyond that specified by term limits, but make them run for
that term on a statewide basis. Then we can all have a voice.</TE>

<TE>   Shame on The Times for endorsing Proposition 45. Thankfully, your
editorial clarified that big business and powerful unions are behind
the measure. Now it appears that we can add The Times to that
illustrious list.</TE>

<HD>Cat Cloning Really Sets the Fur Flying</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The birth of cloned kitten CC shows once again that some scientists
spend far too much time in their laboratories and out of the grip of
reality ("In Texas, Cloning Advance Comes on Little Cat Feat," Feb.
15). If Drs. Tae Young and Mark Westhusin had visited any shelter in
any community in this country they would have found thousands of
wonderful kittens on just the day little CC was born.</LD>
<LD>   As much as we love the animal companions who share our home, we
would never consider cloning any of them. There are far too many
homeless animals out there literally dying for lack of a home. Also,
their life histories are part of the wonder of our dog, cats, rabbits
and guinea pig. If our kitten Harley hadn't been rescued from small
boys about to throw him into traffic at the age of 2 weeks, he
wouldn't be the funny little guy he is, craving food, warmth and
touch and being cautious with strangers.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a plan: If we're going to clone anything, let's clone
humans with a modicum of compassion and common sense.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have owned animals continuously for the last 45 years and am, in
many ways, a person who might be termed an extremist when it comes to
this subject. My pets have always lived in the house, slept on my bed
and have been given expensive and extensive medical care, even in
advanced old age. In fact, I prepare their food myself because I
firmly believe that no commercially prepared animal food is
completely acceptable. However, I have never even vaguely considered
cloning one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning enthusiasts, at least among animal owners, fail to
recognize that it is nothing more than scientific sleight of hand. It
is not immortality but merely a replacement pet that looks
suspiciously like the deceased one and will allow the owner to
indulge a strange fantasy--not unlike that presented in stories such
as William Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily." Grieving pet owners need to
turn to reputable breeders or humane organizations for new sources of
animal companions rather than to the medical laboratory.</TE>

<LD>There may or may not be good reason for the Alabama Supreme Court to
have validated the custody determination in this case ("Judge Calls
Being Lesbian 'Detestable,' " Feb. 16). But the interjection in the
written decision of wording such as homosexuality being "an inherent
evil" that shouldn't be tolerated, and that homosexuality is
"abhorrent, immoral, detestable, a crime against nature, and a
violation of the laws of nature" speaks to an era of bigotry that has
no place in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Quoting Scripture and displaying the Ten Commandments are the
shield behind which all of the great injustices of hate have been
carried out in the past. Chief Justice Roy Moore and his cronies on
the court need to be purged from our system of justice. They have no
business making decisions that affect the rights and lives of people.
Unfortunately, there is a dementia of power that will make these
judges unable to understand that the rest of the country now sees
them disrobed and without honor. But as a country we should now
expect that they will be formally removed from the bench, and soon.</LD>

the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court taking children away
from their mother solely because she is a lesbian. How little things
have changed there! The judge did so with hate spewing from his
mouth--just as it did in 1965. How much longer will it take before
hatred and bigotry are truly in the past?</TE>

<LD>Proposition 42 ("No on 42," editorial, Feb. 18) does not go far
enough. There are more of us driving more vehicles more miles. As
vehicles become more fuel efficient, we burn less gas and pay fewer
gas taxes. Demand for road space is up, but the means of providing
supply is dwindling. Growth in the zero-emission-vehicle fleet
compounds the problem. A crisis is brewing that legislators are
reluctant to face. Gas taxes should go for roads.</LD>
<LD>   Even transit investments are a mistake, unless decision makers get
serious about spending wisely. In Los Angeles, we have spent more
than $7 billion on rail and reduced total transit use.</LD>

their California Voter Information Guides. If so, they will find that
the opposition to Proposition 42 consists of special interest groups
that wish to siphon gasoline sales tax money for their own selfish
interests. In order to ensure that there will be some reliable source
of revenue to address the critical infrastructure needs of
California, voters should support Proposition 42.</TE>

<LD>Re "A Lone Holdout Doesn't Stand a Chance on a Jury," Commentary,
Feb. 15: The issue of pressure placed on jurors to reach a verdict
aside, I was amazed by Rebecca LaVally's naivete. A man of 31 and a
girl of 15 do not meet on equal footing. At 15, the girl is still a
child, vulnerable and lacking the maturity to protect her own
interests. A law making it a crime for a person more than 10 years
older to touch a child "with the intent of arousing passion" exists
for obvious reasons: to prevent adult predators from taking sexual
advantage of kids.</LD>
<LD>   LaVally should stop regretting that she didn't "hold out" and

<LD>Re "Glendale Nears Vote on Oakmont Project," Feb. 16: Developer John
L. Gregg argues that the luxurious 572-home development in the
Verdugo Mountains above Oakmont Country Club would elevate Glendale's
quality of life, particularly for executives who work at Nestle USA,
DreamWorks SKG and other city businesses, who are tired of commuting
long distances. "Why not give them a nice house here?" Gregg asks.
"Right now, they're jamming the freeways and polluting the air."</LD>
<LD>   Because, Mr. Gregg, Oakmont's pristine woodlands--graced with oak
and sycamore trees, acorn woodpeckers, deer and other wildlife--will
be displaced by your massive hillside development. Because the years
of traffic, noise and pollution that it will take to build your
McMansions will benefit only the overpaid executives (consumers?) who
could very well find existing homes for sale today in Glendale and
the surrounding areas.</LD>

<TE>   As a school nurse working for the Glendale Unified School
District, I can say firsthand that 572 homes would add a significant
number of children to the Verdugo Woodlands School, which is already
bursting at its seams. Possibly they could spread them to the
next-closest school, Fremont? Same problem. I don't know how an
environmental impact report could possibly conclude that it would not
have a significant impact on these public schools. Perhaps they need
to speak to GUSD Superintendent Jim Brown or to the principals at
these schools. They are jammed past capacity now. For example,
Rosemont Middle School has well over 1,400 children. Its maximum
capacity is 800. This is the school the children from this
development would go to.</TE>
<TE>   Count me as another voice against this bad proposal.</TE>

<TE>   In regard to the "dozens" of commuting executives whom Gregg is
hoping to accommodate by carving into the beautiful Verdugo
hillsides, I would wonder what is preventing them from purchasing
existing upscale homes that come on the market daily in Glendale, La
Canada, Pasadena, etc.? It seems that Gregg's concern for air quality
rings more than a little hollow when one considers that his proposal
requires the removal of more than 3,000 trees, bulldozing through
massive areas of wildlife habitat and permanently scarring one of the
most scenic vistas in the area.</TE>

<HD>Takeover of Hurley by Giant Nike Changes the Dynamics</HD>
<DH>Apparel: In the insular world of the surfing culture, the
tendency is to view outsiders with a wary eye.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST and MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When respected Orange County surfwear maker Bob Hurley split from
Billabong in 1998 and launched his own business, the Frog House was
there for him.</LD>
<LD>   The Frog House Surfboard Shop, in Newport Beach, immediately
opened up rack space for the new brand on the block, Hurley
International, which has since mushroomed into a $70-million a year
business.</LD>
<LD>   That's how it works in the surf and skating and snowboarding
apparel industry: The shops support the locals and help keep
outsiders at bay.</LD>
<TE>   But on Friday, Frog House owner Thomas Brimer found himself
wrestled with a vexing new question: How will he deal with a Hurley
brand that's now owned by Nike Inc., a giant outsider?</TE>
<TE>   "Bob Hurley treated me, as a retailer, really well," said Brimmer,
who goes by the initials T.K. "If we see a substantial change in
attitude or business practices, I'm gone."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the industry, surfers, skateboarders and business
owners were wondering out loud how Nike's purchase of the Costa
Mesa-based Hurley, which was disclosed Thursday, will impact the
tight-knit board-sport apparel industry.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Nike had been trying to break in. Now, they seemed to
have found the key.</TE>
<TE>   Some said the sale will spark more consolidation in the industry,
a process that's already underway. Others said Nike will move in like
a steamroller, using its deep pockets to swipe sales and buy more
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Nike, however, said it will be business as usual at Hurley
International, with its founder calling the shots and the same sales
force, distribution network and executive team. "Nothing's going to
change for Hurley," Nike spokeswoman Joani Komlos said Friday.
"You're not going to see their clothing in every storefront. We don't
want to make Hurley as mainstream or big as the swoosh."</TE>
<TE>   Nike's acquisition of Hurley is not a first step toward dominance
in the surf and skate industry, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we're coming in to takeover the industry or the
world," she said. "There's room for lots of companies."</TE>
<TE>   But Joseph Teklits, an analyst with First Union Securities, said
he thinks Nike plans to take on the surf industry leaders such as
Quiksilver and Billabong.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to put money in Hurley, bulk it up and try to steal
market share," he said. "And they're going to try to roll over any
companies that get in their way." In five years, Hurley could have
sales as high as $300 million, more than four times present revenue,
Teklits said.</TE>
<TE>   Nike's purchase fits in with the company's strategy of acquiring
new brands to fuel growth, said Dennis Rosenberg, an analyst who
covers Nike for Credit Suisse First Boston. In recent years, Nike has
bought a manufacturer of hockey skates and provided seed money for an
Oregon skate footwear company.</TE>
<TE>   But if Nike plans on improving its position in the surf and skate
industry through acquisitions, it might find few sellers, especially
among hard-core enthusiasts, said Sean Smith, director of marketing
for the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of guys are more interested in being able to take off at
lunch to surf than in making a ton of money by selling out to big
businesses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Komlos did not rule out Nike snapping up other surf and skate
businesses in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders differed on how well the two companies will blend.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, does Hurley bring Nike credibility or does Nike
ruin Hurley's credibility?" said Gregg Steiner, owner of The
Greenroom Surf &amp; Skate shop in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Nike will help Hurley with its planned international expansion,
which is expected to begin by the end of the year, Komlos said. Both
Hurley and Nike see foreign markets as the biggest growth opportunity
going forward for the surf company.</TE>
<TE>   The two companies began talks about nine months ago when a firm
representing Hurley contacted Nike about a potential partnership,
Komlos said.</TE>
<TE>   But to plenty of Hurley's admirers, the news was about as welcome
as a wipeout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's horrible," said Luke Snyder, a Whittier warehouseman who was
at Huntington Beach on Friday. "Nike's like basketball, and Hurley's
like surf. It doesn't make any sense."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, it made sense to some business owners.</TE>
<TE>   "Our industry's full of lots of the young entrepreneurs," said
Brad Dorfman, president of Vision Street Wear Inc., a skateboard
apparel company in Costa Mesa. "Some of them get to catch some air,
like Bob did. That's what they all try and strive for."</TE>

<HD>California Job Market Rises by 30,200</HD>
<DH>Economy: Gain in January came even as unemployment rate
climbed to 6.2% during the month, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providing hope that much of California is shaking off its economic
lull, officials reported Friday that the state gained 30,200 jobs in
January, the biggest monthly increase in a year.</LD>
<LD>   The news in the jobs report wasn't all upbeat. The state also
reported that the unemployment rate climbed to 6.2% in January, up
from 6.1% the previous two months, reaching its highest level in more
than four years. By contrast, the national jobless rate fell to 5.6%
last month from 5.8% in December.</LD>
<LD>   Still, analysts said the California unemployment figure was pushed
up not by layoffs but by an influx of new job hunters who had dropped
off the state's radar screen--a phenomenon that often signals the
beginning of recovery.</LD>
<TE>   "At the first sign that more jobs are available, people rush back
into the work force and start looking," said Brad Williams, senior
economist for the California legislative analyst's office. "That's
not uncommon at a turning point."</TE>
<TE>   Friday's figures, which also included a reassessment of last
year's economic performance, showed that December's job market was
better than previously reported, with California picking up 10,900
jobs. Earlier, officials reported that the state lost 600 jobs in
December, following losses in each of the three previous months.</TE>
<TE>   January's job gains were spread across a variety of industries,
including services, retailing, construction, government and
nondurable goods manufacturing. Analysts said the net job growth
points to the resilience of the California economy and provides more
evidence that the downturn may be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just tremendous," said Howard L. Roth, chief economist
for the California Department of Finance. "You'd be hard-pressed to
say this to an economy in recession."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, unemployment remained at 6.3% for a second
consecutive month, while Orange and San Diego counties continue to
post some of the lowest figures in the state. The figures show that
Orange County's jobless rate was 3.8% in January, up from 3.2% in
December, while San Diego's rose to 3.9% last month from 3.3% in
December.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in the jobless level was widespread, with 57 of
California's 58 counties reporting increases in their rates. Still,
the Bay Area continues to be the state's weakest region. In Santa
Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, unemployment was virtually
nonexistent a year ago, registering 1.7% in January 2001. Last month,
Santa Clara's jobless rate hit 7.5%, up from 6.3% in December.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco has suffered a similar spike in unemployment. Last
month, San Francisco's jobless rate hit 7%, up from 5.9% in December
and 3.3% in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Michael S. Bernick, director of the California Employment
Development Department, blames the double whammy of the dot-com bust
and a dramatic falloff in travel after the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   ''San Francisco has taken two big hits,'' Bernick said. ''They
continue to struggle.''</TE>
<TE>   Largely because of the relative strength of the overall Southern
California economy--particularly in the counties surrounding Los
Angeles--the state has lost less momentum than the rest of the
country since the U.S. recession began in March.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Roth said it is debatable whether California actually
ever fell into recession. Although there is no formal definition of a
state recession, it normally is a period of six months of continuing
job losses.</TE>
<TE>   Roth's upbeat outlook stemmed in part from an another report
released Friday, an annual reassessment of employment figures known
as "benchmarking." The new figures showed that California did not
lose jobs in back-to-back quarters, as had been thought, and that the
state overall lost fewer jobs than previous calculations. The
official job loss figure for 2001 stands at 26,100, versus the
previously reported decline of 38,100.</TE>
<TE>   The last time California's jobless rate matched last month's level
was in October 1997, when it also was 6.2%. The last time the state
gained more jobs in a single month was in January 2001, when 44,300
positions were added.</TE>
<TE>   Among Latinos, the jobless rate last month was 7.3%, up from 7.1%
in December and 6.5% a year earlier. For blacks, joblessness was
8.6%, up from 8.5% in December and 7.6% in January 2001. Among
whites, unemployment was 5.3% last month, up from 5.1% in December
and 4.8% a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The statewide employment figures, and the numbers for Los Angeles
County, are adjusted for seasonal trends such as the typical January
layoff of workers hired for the holiday season. The figures for other
counties are not adjusted, in part because of the small sampling of
households on which those estimates are based.</TE>
<TE>   Without the seasonal adjustments, the jobless rate for California
in January would be 6.7%, up from 5.8% in December and 5.2% in
January 2001. Likewise, the unadjusted rate for Los Angeles County
would be 6.6% for last month, up from 5.9% in December and from 5.3%
in January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Among other Southern California counties, whose rates are not
adjusted for seasonal trends, the jobless rates were:</TE>
<TE>   * Riverside, 5.6% last month, up from 5.0% in December and 4.9% a
year earlier;</TE>
<TE>   * San Bernardino, 5.3% last month, up from 4.5% in December and
4.7% a year earlier;</TE>
<TE>   * Ventura, 5.4% last month, up from 5.0% in December and 4.6% a
year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Mergers Remaking Defense Industry</HD>
<DH>Acquisitions: Rapid consolidation is altering the
competitive dynamics and drawing attention of regulators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mergers are as intrinsic to American business as taxes, yet few
industries have seen such prolonged consolidation as defense, whose
latest spree of merger activity stretches back a decade.</LD>
<LD>   A nearly continuous stream of acquisitions--costing more than $80
billion--has changed the competitive dynamics of the defense industry
and attracted an increasingly sharp focus by Washington regulators.
Northrop Grumman Corp.'s unsolicited offer to buy TRW Inc. for $5.9
billion would further shrink the base of big defense contractors.</LD>
<LD>   In the decades before the early 1990s, the defense industry had no
dominant players and many of the key contractors were conglomerates
that made most of their money in commercial markets. Today, the big
companies operate mainly in defense or aerospace markets, and a
handful of them dominate the industry.</LD>
<TE>   The defense industry's current Big 3 prime contractors: Lockheed
Martin Corp., Boeing Co. and Raytheon Co. are products of the 1990s
consolidation, built from dozens of deals that pieced together
producers of electronics, spacecraft, airplanes, ships and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's effort to buy TRW comes nearly four years after many
thought the consolidation was mostly finished.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was Lockheed Martin's 1998 decision to scrap its
planned purchase of Northrop Grumman in the face of U.S. antitrust
concerns that many viewed as the apex of the merger wave in the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   But Northrop's aggressive chief executive, Kent Kresa, then went
on an acquisition binge, paring the number of major defense players
even further. If it buys TRW, Northrop Grumman would add to a stable
of recent acquisitions that include defense-electronics maker Litton
Industries Inc. and aircraft carrier builder Newport News
Shipbuilding Inc.</TE>
<TE>   A few other second-tier defense firms also have been merging--or
at least trying to--and Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with Teal
Group, an industry consulting firm in Fairfax, Va., said he has no
doubt the trend will continue.</TE>
<TE>   Honeywell Inc. and AlliedSignal Corp. merged in 1999. United
Technologies Corp. also bought Sundstrand Corp. in 1999, and General
Dynamics Corp. launched the bidding for Newport News last year before
losing to Northrop Grumman. General Electric Co., a maker of jet
engines, among other products , tried to buy Honeywell but was
thwarted by European antitrust officials last year.</TE>
<TE>   TRW, in fact, had been the subject of takeover speculation for
years prior to Northrop Grumman's bid. Others believed potential
players in further consolidation are Alliant TechSystems Inc., L3
Communications Holdings Corp. and GenCorp's Aerojet propulsion
business. GenCorp sold Aerojet's electronic information systems
business to Northrop Grumman last year.</TE>
<TE>   And Northrop Grumman might not be TRW's only suitor. Despite the
Pentagon's past protests about letting the prime contractors get any
bigger, Lockheed Martin and the other two might consider bidding for
TRW as well because of its strong position in satellites and missile
defense. Some second-tier defense firms also might view a TRW merger
as a way to burnish their competitive position.</TE>
<TE>   Other industries once populated with several major players also
have witnessed rapid consolidations over the last decade. They
include the oil business, media and entertainment companies,
supermarkets, banks, brokerage firms and other financial-services
concerns, and telecommunications and cable firms.</TE>
<TE>   The rationale behind the mergers is usually the same: The buyers
want to "augment the depth of their products and services, extend
their geographic reach" and reduce excess capacity in the industry
that's eroding profits for everyone, said Michael Ervin, an analyst
with RCW Mirus Inc., an investment bank in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, defense mergers were encouraged by the Pentagon in the
1990s because, amid a sharp drop in post-Cold War defense spending,
too many contractors were chasing too few defense dollars. A similar
trend is evident in banking, where many analysts have said for years
that there are far more banks than U.S. consumers need.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers in these mergers also hope to gain more control over a
product's journey from the drawing board to the customer--"vertical
integration" in corporate jargon. This strategy is particularly
appealing to media and entertainment companies that merge in order to
tap profits from both producing and distributing programs and other
content.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of these industries' mergers complain that a handful
of giants has come to enjoy excessive dominance over their markets,
raising potential risks for the companies' customers, suppliers and
employees. The fear: not enough competition to keep prices down and
keep innovation up.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon used that very reason to block Lockheed Martin's
purchase of Northrop Grumman. Though it wanted fewer contractors, it
still sought to maintain competition for key defense programs. Even
after that move, the Pentagon was criticized for having already given
up too much control over weapons programs by allowing the creation of
Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the Defense Department also said it would continue to
encourage mergers among smaller aerospace and defense firms--provided
they didn't harm competition either. With that endorsement in hand,
the second-tier companies have another reason to merge: To gain more
bargaining clout as suppliers to the prime contractors, said Teal
Group's Aboulafia.</TE>
<TE>   "They need the might to stand up to the primes, because the primes
are squeezing the life out of them" in terms of putting pressure on
the suppliers to keep their prices down, he said.</TE>
<TE>   By broadening their lines of business using mergers, they make
themselves partners with the prime contractors, he said. "In other

and the supplier gains that ability by acquiring other companies
involved in the projects, Aboulafia said.</TE>

<HD>Enron Had Easy Access to FERC, Boxer Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY RIVERA BROOKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp. executives met with or called top federal energy
regulators at least 25 times in less than a year, including two White
House-convened meetings in which then-Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay
and others grappled with California's energy crisis as blackouts
rolled across the state, according to a summary of the meetings
released Friday by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).</LD>
<LD>   Boxer said she is disturbed by the list of contacts between Enron
and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, saying it "shows that
decision makers at FERC were wined and dined by Enron both in
Washington and Texas in an obvious effort to win friends and allies
as part of its campaign to control all aspects of America's energy
policy."</LD>
<LD>   The list details contacts by telephone and in person, frequently
over meals, between 12 current and former commissioners and staff
members of FERC and executives at Enron, including Lay and then-Chief
Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling between August 2000 and June 2001.
Topics included California's energy mess, electricity deregulation,
natural gas pipeline safety and a tour of Enron's energy-trading
operation.</LD>
<TE>   Twice in January 2000, Enron and FERC officials attended large
meetings that also included then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson and
California Gov. Gray Davis to discuss ways to resolve California's
electricity crisis before George W. Bush was inaugurated.</TE>
<TE>   FERC Chairman Pat Wood said he does not believe Enron "had any
undue influence" over the commission's decisions and did not violate
federal laws or FERC rules that prohibit trying to influence the
direction of a contested matter. Enron spokespeople did not return
calls requesting comment.</TE>
<TE>   But consumer advocates expressed outrage at the kind of entree
granted to Enron executives at a time when the consumer groups were
locked out of discussions at FERC on how to fix California's
electricity problems and other energy matters.</TE>
<TE>   "We, along with all consumer groups, had no access to FERC," said
Tyson Slocum, energy research director for Public Citizen, a
Washington-based consumer lobbying organization. "It's not a
regulatory body that is very friendly or responsive. It is remarkable
that a company like Enron can get such access."</TE>
<TE>   Enron, a big campaign donor, was noted for its ability to reach
key politicians and regulators as it grew to become the nation's
seventh-largest corporation and the world's largest energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   But Enron lost an important round in California when FERC, under
new Chairman Wood, decided in May to put price controls on
electricity sales to the state. Similarly, as it plunged toward
bankruptcy last year, Enron's pleas to Bush administration officials
for help with its banks and credit-rating firms went unanswered.</TE>
<TE>   Boxer, who asked for the list Jan. 31, said she would push for
more detail about the meetings. She also has asked the General
Accounting Office to look into the contacts.</TE>
<TE>   "It is disturbing that during the period of time that California
consumers were begging for relief from the price-gouging electricity
crisis, Enron was engaging in an active campaign to get close to the
top FERC decision makers--the only people who could bring relief to
my state," Boxer said in a statement.</TE>

<HD>Alternative Global Plan Proposed</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Group of shareholders offers to put $5.5
billion into the company and repay all debt holders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A group of Global Crossing Ltd. shareholders opposed to the company's
bankruptcy reorganization plan filed its own proposal Friday,
offering to put as much as $5.5 billion into the fiber-optic network
operator over three years and repay all creditors and debt holders.</LD>
<LD>   The shareholder proposal, an unusual offer for the sale of
warrants to buy stock at a later date, was quickly panned by industry
analysts. But it spurred hope that new bidders will soon emerge to
offer more than the $750 million that the company was able to get in
a pending deal with two Asian companies. Under Global Crossing's
plan, shareholders would get nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Meantime, the company said Friday that it has offered a voluntary
severance program to the company's 5,000 employees in North America
as part of its cost-cutting efforts.</LD>
<TE>   Company spokesman John Schmidt said there is "no set number" for
the payroll reduction, but several employees have said as much as 40%
of the staff may leave through voluntary departures and
firings.Seizing on shareholder unrest with Global's management,
K.A.B. Group, a boutique international investment banking house based
in New York, cobbled together a plan to refinance the company with
help from David E. Mersereau, an investment advisor in the
Connecticut firm of Coburn &amp; Meredith.</TE>
<TE>   Mersereau said the plan allows the company, with $22.4 billion in
assets tied mainly into the world's biggest network of fiber-optic
cable, to remain viable as industry demand catches up to supply.</TE>
<TE>   The aim is to upset the pending plan that Global had arranged with
two Asian companies, Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia.</TE>
<TE>   The Asian companies would invest $750 million for a 79% stake in
Global Crossing. Preferred and common shareholders would get nothing,
and bondholders would get the remaining 21% of the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you wipe out $6 billion in equity and not give us
anything, and how can you wipe out $2.4 billion in preferred shares
and not give us anything," said Kennon A. Brennen, managing partner
of K.A.B. Group. "People are incensed with getting wiped out. This
alternative calls them to arms to reinvest in this asset, and now
we'll see what they do."</TE>
<TE>   The K.A.B. proposal, filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan, would raise $2 million by issuing 1.5 billion warrants,
and would raise an additional $3.5 billion in 18 months to three
years later as the warrants are converted to stock.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would pay back interest and dividends due on more than
$10 billion in debt securities, preferred stock and loans and make
regular payments under existing terms of those transactions. Existing
shareholders would retain at least 37.7% of the company, and
investors who convert warrants into shares would get the rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a pipe dream," said industry analyst Patrick Comack
at Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami. "I don't think this company can be revived
as a separate public company." The pending deal with the Asian group
is so bad, he said, that there is little hope that anyone would
improve on it much.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Computer Sciences Corp. said Friday that it will end a
$400-million outsourcing deal with Global Crossing that the two
companies signed less than three months ago.</TE>

<HD>Blue Chips Recover as Investors Seek Safety</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks posted gains Friday as investors looking for safe bets spurred
a late-day recovery in a market riddled with worries over the
strength of corporate profits and the soundness of accounting
practices.</LD>
<LD>   Investors trolled for old-line firms such as consumer products
company Procter &amp; Gamble and manufacturer 3M.</LD>
<LD>   "People want to be invested, but they want to be invested safely,"
James Awad, chairman of Awad Asset Management, told Bloomberg News.
"They don't want to be disappointed by earnings problems, accounting
problems or balance sheet problems, so they're gravitating to more
defensive stocks."</LD>
<TE>   Buying by short sellers--investors who sold borrowed stock in
hopes of buying it back at a lower price--also helped pull up Wall
Street as they got out of the market ahead of the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The New York Stock Exchange reported Friday that the number of
shares of NYSE-listed stocks that were sold short hit an all-time
high in February after dipping in January. NYSE short interest was
6.46 billion shares as of Feb. 15, compared with 6.41 billion shares
a month earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 133.47 points, or
1.4%, to 9,968.15. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.30 points, or
0.5%, to 1,724.54, after floundering in negative territory. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 8.89 points, or 0.8%, to 1,089.84.
Winners led losers by 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 9 to 8 on
Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Dow edged up 0.7%, Nasdaq fell 4.4% and the S&amp;P
500 lost 1.3%. It was the fourth straight weekly loss for Nasdaq--the
longest losing streak in almost a year.</TE>
<TE>   The market endured a roller-coaster week of sudden rallies and
sharp sell-offs as investors struggle to gauge the depth of corporate
accounting problems and the health of the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   J.P Morgan Chase was the latest company pounded by worries over
dealings with bankrupt energy trader Enron. News of a review by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York sent the banking firm's shares to a
three-year low before they rebounded to close at $28.19, down 95
cents.</TE>
<TE>   Industrial and manufacturing stocks helped buoy the Dow. Procter &amp;
Gamble climbed $2.50 to $85.60. 3M rose $3 to $119. Construction
equipment maker Caterpillar rose 80 cents to $52.68.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bonds capped their fourth straight winning week as
investors worried about accounting issues continued to seek shelter
outside the stock market. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury
note slipped to 4.84% from 4.85% on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * Computer Associates fell $2.91 to $15.99 and was the NYSE's most
active issue. Salomon Smith Barney cut its rating on the software
maker to "neutral" from "buy" after the firm said it was being
investigated by federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   * Calpine lost 21 cents to $7.11 on concerns that a delay in
completing a $1-billion credit line may mean less favorable borrowing
terms for the power company.</TE>
<TE>   * Exxon Mobil rose $1.57 to $40.72. Oil prices made minor gains
and oil stocks rose amid speculation that the United States might
attack Iraq and concerns that Russia may stop cooperating with
OPEC-led production cuts.</TE>
<TE>   * Circuit City slumped $7.04 to $16.55 after the consumer
electronics retailer said sales are running below expectations and
remodeling and store relocations will shave earnings in 2002 and
2003.</TE>
<TE>   * Petco Animal Supplies gained $1 to $20 as the retailer made its
return as a publicly traded firm. Petco priced 14.5 million shares at
$19 a share Thursday. It trades under the symbol PETC on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>New Inquiry Into Claims  in Napster Suit Can Begin</HD>
<DH>Technology: A judge allows probe into whether labels own
the copyrights and whether they misuse them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With hopes for a settlement fading, a federal judge Friday revived
the major record companies' lawsuit against Napster Inc. by opening a
new inquiry into copyright-misuse and improper-ownership claims by
the labels.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco gave
Mountain View, Calif.-based Napster permission to gather more
evidence on two potential defenses to the labels' lawsuit. The
company can explore whether the labels owned the copyrights to 213
songs that Napster users traded, and whether the labels misused their
copyrights to impede competition.</LD>
<LD>   In particular, Patel said the labels' two joint ventures to
distribute music online in competition with Napster and other
independent companies "may run afoul of antitrust laws." Reprising a
concern she voiced last year, Patel added, "Even on the undeveloped
record before the court, these joint ventures look bad, sound bad and
smell bad."</LD>
<TE>   Cary Sherman, general counsel of the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, responded, "Napster's allegations of misuse are without
merit.... We look forward to providing the court with evidence to
refute Napster's claims."</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Schwartz, Napster's general counsel, also said he looked
forward to the case moving forward on the ownership and misuse
issues. But he added that settlement talks would continue.</TE>
<TE>   Patel had put the labels' 2-year-old lawsuit on hold for 30 days
in mid-January after the two sides said they were nearing a
settlement. But those talks produced so little progress, the parties
did not ask Patel to extend the stay when it expired this week.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts say Napster is still likely to lose the case, making
the company liable for a huge amount of damages. But copyright
ownership and anti-competitive practices are touchy subjects for the
labels, which are being scrutinized by the Justice Department's
antitrust division and whose copyrights are being challenged in court
and in state legislatures by artists.</TE>
<TE>   The latest twist in the lawsuit came in response to the record
companies' motion for summary judgment, which would decide the case
in their favor without a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Patel told lawyers for both sides in mid-January that she planned
to allow Napster to gather evidence on copyright ownership and misuse
before ruling on the motion. Lawyers quickly sought a timeout in the
proceedings, with some representatives of the labels saying privately
that they didn't want to go through the expense if a settlement was
within reach.</TE>
<TE>   No settlement was forthcoming, however, as Napster wasn't able to
reach deals with the labels for the distribution of their songs. That
led Patel to issue her order.</TE>
<TE>   On the ownership issue, Patel said Napster "raised serious
questions" about the validity of the labels' claims to own the songs
as "works for hire"--a claim that musicians in the Recording Artists
Coalition also dispute. But if the labels can produce contracts for
each song that assigned them the copyright or described it as a work
for hire, Patel said, "ownership of the work is probably
established."</TE>
<TE>   On copyright misuse, Napster claimed that its deal with
MusicNet--a joint venture by RealNetworks Inc. and the owners of
three major record companies--was unduly restrictive. It also argued
that MusicNet and Pressplay--a joint venture by the other two major
record companies--were anti-competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Patel said Napster had "virtually no access to most commercial
available music" unless it signed a deal with MusicNet that required
it to obtain licenses from MusicNet and not its competitors. As for
the antitrust argument, Patel said MusicNet and Pressplay look like
entities designed to let the labels "use their copyrights and
extensive market power to dominate the market for digital music
distribution." The judge emphasized, however, that she didn't have
enough evidence from either side to decide the copyright-misuse
claim.</TE>
<TE>   Antitrust investigators for the Justice Department also are
scrutinizing MusicNet, Pressplay and the labels' licensing practices.</TE>

<HD>Justice Dept. Takes Reins in Comcast-AT&amp;T Deal</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department asked for more
information about Comcast Corp.'s bid to buy AT&amp;T's cable operations,
the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the deal became tangled in a simmering controversy over
whether media-related mergers should be reviewed by the Justice
Department or antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Consumer groups criticized the Justice Department's decision to
review the acquisition, saying it showed that the FTC had ceded
authority for cable-TV transactions. A source close to the matter
said FTC Chairman Timothy Muris had decided to cede the agency's
authority.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the FTC declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers Union spokesman David Butler said his group is concerned
that the Justice Department will be less rigorous in its review of
cable-TV mergers than the more bipartisan FTC.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast said it expects the merger will close by the end of this
year.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T rose 35 cents to $14.70 on the NYSE, and Comcast rose $1.44
to $32.55 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Circuit City Stores Cuts Outlook, Plans Spinoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Circuit City Stores Inc. warned that fourth-quarter earnings for its
retailing operations will miss Wall Street expectations and said it
planned to spin off its profitable CarMax division.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement sent Circuit City shares plummeting $7.04, or
30%, to $16.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. CarMax currently
trades as a tracking stock designed to reflect the used car seller's
performance. Its shares fell $3.16, or 11%, to $25.35 on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   The company said a spinoff of CarMax into a separate company would
enable investors to analyze each business on its own merits. In
recent years, strong CarMax earnings often masked losses at the
Circuit City stores.</LD>
<TE>   The company said it now expects Circuit City Group to achieve
earnings of 70 cents to 74 cents for the quarter ending Feb. 28,
rather than the 75 cents analysts expected. It cited disappointing
sales so far this year, largely because inventory of such items as
camcorders was too low to meet demand.</TE>
<TE>   The plan to spin off CarMax, which is subject to shareholder
approval, would give investors one share of the new CarMax company
stock for each share they hold of the CarMax tracking stock. Holders
of Circuit City stock would get about one-third of a share of CarMax
stock for each share of Circuit City stock. The plan is subject to
shareholder approval.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestle, the biggest food maker, filed to sell as much as $2.4 billion
of stock in its Alcon Inc. eye-care unit, in what may be the first
multibillion-dollar initial public offering in the U.S. this year.</LD>
<LD>   Alcon will seek to sell a 23% stake to new investors and transfer
the IPO proceeds to Swiss parent Nestle through the redemption of
preferred stock, according to documents filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Alcon, whose products include equipment for cataract surgery and
disinfecting solutions for contact lenses, is considered by analysts
to be Nestle's fastest-growing and most-profitable unit. It had sales
of about $2.75 billion last year.</LD>
<TE>   The underwriters for the IPO, led by Credit Suisse First Boston
and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., plan to market 69.75 million Alcon shares at
$31 to $35 each and have set March 20 as the date to announce a firm
price.</TE>

<HD>HP Slams Dissident Director Hewlett</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. launched its most scathing attack yet on
dissident director Walter Hewlett and his opposition to the merger
with Compaq Computer Corp., calling him a "man who has no plan" for
the future of the company.</LD>
<LD>   With less than a month until shareholders vote on the $21-billion
merger and the outcome far from clear, HP board members said
Hewlett's proposals announced this week amounted to a cobbled
together, "now you see it, now you don't" strategy.</LD>
<LD>   In the open letter to shareholders, HP said "When Walter Hewlett
tells you he has no plan and then says he really has one, and then
vehemently denies he has a plan and then says he has a new plan--all
in a matter of two weeks--only one thing is entirely clear: This is a
man who has no plan for the future of your company or your
investments in HP shares," the letter said.</LD>
<TE>   Hewlett responded with a brief statement defending his
calculations that HP would be worth $14 to $17 a share more without
Compaq.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Hewlett closed off 17 cents at $19.29, while Compaq rose
21 cents to $10.50, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>The government and Miss Cleo's psychic hotline have reached a
temporary meeting of the minds allowing the telephone service to keep
predicting while an investigator looks into charges that it has
defrauded customers.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Alan Gold of the Southern District of Florida
has approved a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission under
which a court-appointed auditor will monitor all past, present and
future activities of Access Resource Services Inc. and Psychic
Readers Network.</LD>
<LD>   The two Fort Lauderdale, Fla., companies have a national network
of "psychic readers," led by Jamaican soothsayer "Miss Cleo," that
promises insights in matters of love and money.</LD>
<TE>   Under the preliminary injunction, the companies are required to
disclose in their advertisements the cost of their pay-per-call
service; stop representing that callers receive a "free reading;" and
stop using toll-free telephone numbers in ads without disclosing that
the service is accessed through 900 numbers.</TE>

<HD>IRS May Investigate Municipal Bond Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service is considering launching another probe
into the way investment firms have managed municipal bond sales for
governmental entities.</LD>
<LD>   An investigation into "yield-burning"--which allegedly occurred
when municipal issuers attempted to refinance their debt with lower
rates--would deal with bond sales from 1995 forward.</LD>
<LD>   Yield-burning occurs when bankers excessively mark up the prices
of Treasury securities they sell to municipal bond issuers to help
refinance outstanding debt.</LD>
<TE>   The inflated price "burns" down the securities' yield to give the
appearance of compliance with strict tax law while also earning fat
profits for the securities firms.</TE>

<LD>Pat Wood, head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said
price caps on wholesale electricity sales in California should expire
as planned on Sept. 30 as a way to encourage market reforms.</LD>
<LD>   California energy regulators and the energy industry need to
complete market reforms under consideration, and lifting the price
caps can work as an incentive for officials to move quickly to avoid
a sharp increase in prices, Wood said during a field visit by a

<HD>SEC Setting Record Investigation Pace</HD>
<DH>Securities: Probes are focusing on whether companies
provided investors with false or misleading information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Amid landmark financial fiascoes at companies such as Enron Corp. and
Global Crossing Ltd., federal regulators are launching
accounting-fraud investigations at a record pace this year.</LD>
<LD>   In the first 36 calendar days of 2002, the Securities and Exchange
Commission initiated 41 probes of financial-statement fraud by
companies, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said in an interview Friday.
That's more than double the 18 cases in the comparable period last
year.</LD>
<LD>   The investigations seek to determine whether companies provided
false or misleading financial statements to investors.</LD>
<TE>   The frenzied pace reflects, in part, the wave of earnestness that
has engulfed corporate America in the wake of the Enron imbroglio.</TE>
<TE>   Amid investor concerns about the legitimacy of their accounting,
some companies have come forward with disclosures about potential
misdeeds. In other cases, probes have been started after companies
revealed poor earnings or whistle-blowers alleged financial
impropriety.</TE>
<TE>   A significant number of investigations were sparked by voluntary
corporate disclosures, said Pitt, under whom the SEC introduced a
controversial policy in October that promised leniency to companies
that report their own financial wrongdoing and take aggressive steps
to correct it.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was to coax companies to reveal improper activity early
on rather than conceal it for fear of harsh penalties, thus
potentially worsening the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers worried that the policy could induce wrongdoing by
eliminating the fear of punishment.</TE>
<TE>   However, Pitt said Friday that the current mea culpas stand in
contrast to the period after he took office in August, when no
companies made such disclosures.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who had any question about how aggressive we were going to
be certainly ought to understand that we are determined to protect
investors and will do whatever we can to make sure that occurs," Pitt
said.</TE>
<TE>   The new probes are intended partly to send a message to companies
that the SEC will go after wrongdoers, said Henry Hu, a
securities-law professor at the University of Texas at Austin.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that Enron has not put the fear of God into the
hearts of accountants and senior managements, Chairman Pitt is doing
so now," Hu said.</TE>
<TE>   The notoriety brought by Enron and other scandals already has
sparked an "unprecedented" outpouring of leads from corporate
whistle-blowers, SEC enforcement chief Stephen Cutler said in a
speech last week.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the SEC received 525 e-mails per day from members of
the public advising of possible corporate wrongdoing, Cutler said, a
45% increase from last year's average.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 5, the SEC got a record 763 e-mails, Cutler said.</TE>
<TE>   The number of enforcement actions brought by the SEC against
companies over accounting issues has been steadily increasing in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The agency brought 112 such financial fraud actions last year,
compared with 79 in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Financial disclosure issues played a key role in Enron's demise.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An independent record label has agreed to provide more detailed
disclosures to consumers about its copy-protected CDs, settling a
lawsuit brought by a California resident.</LD>
<LD>   Karen DeLise of Marin County sued after buying the Music City
Records release "Charley Pride--A Tribute to Jim Reeves," which uses
technology from Sunncomm Inc. to deter digital copying. The
technology is designed to prevent consumers from playing the CD on
their computers, stopping them from creating MP3 files that could be
shared over the Internet.</LD>
<LD>   Under the settlement, Music City, its distributor Fahrenheit
Entertainment and Sunncomm agreed to make a more extensive disclosure
about what consumers can't do on the packages of the CD. The
settlement sets no precedents and won't apply to other secure CDs.
Ira Rothken, DeLise's attorney, said, "We are hopeful that the record
industry will look to this settlement agreement for guidance on how
to balance digital-rights-management schemes in music CDs with
protecting consumer privacy, reducing consumer annoyance and
providing adequate notice."</LD>

<HD>Smoker to Receive $198,400 in Kansas</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tobacco industry suffered an unexpected defeat in Kansas on
Friday, when a federal jury ordered two cigarette firms to pay
$198,400 and as-yet unspecified punitive damages to a former smoker.</LD>
<LD>   The verdict in Kansas City was a victory for David Burton, 66, a
former janitor and railroad worker who lost his legs to a circulatory
disease that jurors found was caused by his smoking. The eight jurors
ordered R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. to pay $196,416 in compensatory
damages and Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. to pay $1,984  for
Burton's medical bills and economic losses.</LD>
<LD>   Reynolds also was found liable for punitive damages for
fraudulently concealing the risks and addictiveness of smoking,
according to the unanimous verdict. The punitive damages will be
determined by U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum.</LD>
<TE>   The outcome of the case brought several firsts. Cigarette makers
had never previously lost a case in the conservative Midwest and,
except for a case overturned on appeal, had not been defeated in
federal court--where stricter rules of evidence often favor the
defense. Nor had tobacco companies lost a case involving peripheral
vascular disease, the smoking-related ailment that led to the
amputation of Burton's legs.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's verdict "proves that tobacco companies are vulnerable in
a wheat state, granola state, sunshine state and wherever juries get
a chance to learn exactly what cigarette companies have been doing
... for the past 50 years," said Mark Gottlieb, a lawyer for the
Tobacco Products Liability Project, a  promoter of anti-tobacco
suits.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel W. Donahue, senior vice president for Reynolds, said the
evidence presented at the trial "does not support this verdict....
Reynolds Tobacco did not conceal any information from Mr. Burton," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   According to evidence in the case, Burton began smoking in 1950
and quit in 1993, when he lost his legs.</TE>
<TE>   Both companies were found guilty of failing to warn about the
risks of smoking before warning labels appeared in the 1960s.  The
jury rejected a claim that the companies' brands were defectively
designed.</TE>

<HD>Medalists to See More Gold in Marketing Deals</HD>
<DH>Advertising: A wealth of business opportunities could turn
Sarah Hughes into a multimillionaire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sarah Hughes' come-from-behind victory Thursday night instantly
propelled the teen figure skating sensation to the top of a powerful
sports marketing pantheon that can turn an Olympic gold medal winner
into a multimillionaire.</LD>
<LD>   But there will be enough riches left over to be shared by an
unusually diverse band of athletes whose performances in lesser-known
sports have helped define the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   A wealth of business opportunities--including skating tours,
product endorsements and Hollywood projects--will be offered to
16-year-old Hughes, sports marketers said. Hughes so far has
entrusted her limited business dealings to her father, businessman
and lawyer John Hughes.</LD>
<TE>   "If she were to go for the money, so to speak, she could earn
between $3 million and $5 million a year," said Gary Swain, senior
vice president at IMG, which operates the Stars on Ice skating revue
and represents such athletes as Tiger Woods. "It depends upon what
she wants to do, how hard she wants to work."</TE>
<TE>   Ice skating stars always emerge as the big winners in the Winter
Olympics sports marketing derby. IMG, for example, began courting the
Hughes family before the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   But Hughes is not alone. Corporate executives now are looking at
bobsledder Vonetta Flowers and speedskaters Apolo Anton Ohno,
Jennifer Rodriguez and Derek Parra, who have added a multicolored
Olympic hue to a U.S. Winter Olympics squad that's traditionally been
as white as the snow-covered Wasatch Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "The story line for these Games isn't just about the ice
princesses," said Keith J. Kreiter, the Chicago-based agent for gold
medal skeleton rider Jim Shea.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding's outlaw image in the mainstream media has improved
considerably after halfpipe athlete Kelly Clark grabbed the country's
first gold medal and teammates Ross Powers, Danny Kass and Jarret
"J.J." Thomas swept their event.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be niche opportunities for all of these winners in
the nontraditional sports," said Stephen Greyser, a Harvard
University professor who studies sports marketing. "Look at Jennifer
Rodriguez. A few weeks ago, she was a curiosity, but now she's a
person who could get lots of endorsements and gigs."</TE>
<TE>   It won't be an easy sell for most athletes. The advertising
industry is in its worst slowdown since the Great Depression. And the
sports marketing pie for Winter Olympians typically is smaller than
that of their summer counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   "Only a handful of these athletes will see deals with seven-figure
digits," said Kreiter, who also represents silver medal skeleton
rider Lea Ann Parsley, the 1999 Firefighter of the Year in Ohio. "But
several will do very well from appearances and partnerships with
select corporations."</TE>
<TE>   Some athletes also are understandably skeptical about their
newfound corporate friends. "Yeah, snowboarders have been on 'Leno'
and 'Letterman', but it's ironic that it took a sweep by three
Americans to make these guys realize how hip snowboarding is," said
John Stouffer, an editor with the Transworld Snowboarding Business
trade magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake City Games that began under the shadow cast by the
Sept. 11 attacks probably will be remembered as one of the most
compelling sports gatherings in history.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Clark grabbed the U.S.' first gold medal, some
observers talked up the halfpipe artist as the sweetheart of the
Olympic Games, said Denver-based sports marketing executive Dean
Bonham. "But I haven't heard her name mentioned again."</TE>
<TE>   Clark quickly was caught up in the landslide of gold, silver and
bronze medals won by American athletes. No matter, sports marketers
say, that the stories had to percolate up through a figure-skating
scandal and threats by the Russian and South Korean delegations to
pack up and go home early.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Klug won a bronze medal in snowboard parallel giant slalom
just 18 months after a liver transplant. Flowers, a former track
athlete, became the first African American to win a gold medal in the
Winter Games. Ohno turned NBC's viewers on to the arcane world of
short-course speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   Kreiter already has fielded telephone calls from agents interested
in telling the life stories of Parsley, who was honored after helping
rescue two people from a burning house, and Shea, the son and
grandson of gold medal winners.</TE>
<TE>   When bobsledders and skeleton riders asked Miami businessman Scott
Becher to represent them last year, Becher initially thought it would
be easier to push a four-man bobsled up a hill than to shake down
corporate sponsors for the arcane sports.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with three gold medals, an African American female bobsledder
and a third-generation Olympic hero in his sled, Becher is enjoying
the ride.</TE>
<TE>   "These are great kids who've achieved their athletic dreams and
now, because of the recognition they're finally reaping, are going to
get some nice financial rewards," Becher said.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes in the lesser-known sports know they're not likely to
share in the seven-figure rewards that await top U.S. figure skaters
and elite European skiers. "It's much better than it ever was before
for them, but these sports have a relatively limited marketing
potential," said longtime figure skating agent Michael Rosenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Becher sees bobsledders Flowers and Jill Bakken, the No. 2 women's
team in the U.S. before their gold medal run, as "the ideal vehicle
for marketers looking to target women."</TE>
<TE>   Opinions are divided on the sports marketing future of Canadian
pairs skaters Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. They've already graced
the covers of Time and Newsweek and headlined the "Tonight," "Today"
and "Larry King Live" shows, but sports marketers say the popularity
of pairs skaters typically fades relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   What is clear is that Hughes' sports marketing future is as golden
as the medal dangling around her neck.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a gold, silver and bronze to be awarded in the sports
marketing arena, the winners are Sarah Hughes, Sarah Hughes, Sarah
Hughes," Bonham said. "She's the Mary Lou Retton of the 21st
century."</TE>

<HD>TRW Plays Key Role in Aerospace</HD>
<DH>Technology: Powerhouse also is known for automotive items
most people take for granted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TRW Inc. is a company that makes things most people are barely aware
of--everything from air bags and anti-lock brake systems in vehicles
to spy satellites floating silently in orbit that intercept radio
communications from potential adversaries.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, most people know of TRW from the Orange County-based
consumer credit reporting service it sold six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   TRW still posts a reminder on its Web site that it no longer owns
the credit service, which now is called Experian, and offers a phone
number for the current owners.</LD>
<TE>   Though TRW traces its birth to a small machine shop in Cleveland
in 1901, the modern company was born after two top scientists, Simon
Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, defected from Hughes Aircraft Co. almost 50
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   TRW has evolved into a military and space technology powerhouse,
playing an important part in the development of the nation's
intercontinental ballistic missile system and other defense
technology.</TE>
<TE>   The company employs 10,000 people in Southern California, most of
them based at a sprawling space and satellite technology complex in
Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But TRW has had a rocky year, hurt by the economic recession and
few growth opportunities in the automotive industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sales dipped 5% to $16.4 billion last year from 2000, and profit
plunged 85% to $68 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company instituted a number of cost-reduction measures,
including trimming its global work force in 2001 by 10,000 to 94,000.</TE>
<TE>   It also saw turnover in eight of the 14 senior executive
positions. And earlier this week, David M. Cote, its chief executive,
abruptly resigned to head Honeywell International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, TRW shares rose $10.50 on Friday to close at $50.30
on the New York Stock Exchange on the strength of Northrop Grumman's
$5.9-billion bid for the company. That's almost double TRW's recent
low of $27.43 on Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   About 57% of TRW's expected $17 billion in annual revenue this
year comes from its automotive operations, but the sector can't be
counted on to "turn into an engine of growth and profitability for
the company," in the near term, according to a Merrill Lynch report.</TE>
<TE>   But the aerospace and information systems divisions are expected
to benefit from the increase in U.S. defense spending and could see
sales increase by an annual rate of 12% to 13% this year and next,
said the Merrill Lynch analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The company was integral to the development of Southern
California's aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   One of its greatest successes, said Julie Meier Wright, a former
executive who now heads the San Diego Regional Economic Development
Corp., is building the Pioneer 10 space probe, the first man-made
object to leave the solar system.</TE>
<TE>   "It was designed to take the first photos of Jupiter and last for
only 21 months, but on the day they turned it off, it must have been
25 years old," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   "But it might well be that some of the most important
contributions TRW has made to the nation are the very things they
won't talk about," she added.</TE>
<TE>   According to John Pike, director of the GlobalSecurity.org think
tank in Alexandria, Va., TRW developed some of the first spy
satellites that were able to electronically transmit images to U.S.
intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Previous spy satellites used film-based cameras, periodically
sending the film back to Earth in special reentry vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The cumbersome task of recovering and processing the film delayed
intelligence assessments and was a constant frustration to the
Pentagon and other government analysts, Pike said.</TE>
<TE>   TRW also has been an important player in the development of
satellites that intercept radio communications and radar signals, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   This type of classified work put TRW in the center of one the most
notorious spy cases of the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, federal agents arrested TRW employees Christopher John
Boyce and Andrew Daulton Lee after they sold the Soviets thousands of
secret documents, including material exposing a proposed espionage
satellite system.</TE>
<TE>   The case was recounted in the best-selling book "The Falcon and
the Snowman." Boyce was known as the Falcon because of his love for
the raptors. Lee was the Snowman because he was a drug addict.</TE>
<TE>   Their espionage was blamed in part on TRW's lax security at the
time. At one point, Boyce testified that the two used a
code-destruction machine similar to a blender "for making banana
daiquiris and mai tais."</TE>
<TE>   TRW's predecessor, Thompson Products Co., built parts for World
War I fighter planes and contributed an engine valve used by Charles
Lindbergh on the first transatlantic flight, but the business was
primarily an auto parts supplier well into the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   The company attempted to diversify in 1953, making an offer for
Hughes Aircraft. Hughes rejected the offer, but Thompson was
approached several months later by Hughes executives Ramo and
Wooldridge, who were dissatisfied with how Howard Hughes ran his
business.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson agreed to spot the executives $500,000 to start a
company, and Ramo-Wooldridge Corp. was established soon after in a
closed barbershop near Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The company's early work involved overseeing the development of
the Thor, Atlas, Titan and Minuteman ICBMs.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson merged with Ramo-Wooldridge in 1958, and seven years
later the company changed its name to TRW.</TE>
<TE>   By then the company had entered the space business. It provided
NASA with Pioneer 1, the first industry-built satellite. TRW has
since built nearly 200 spacecraft.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has given birth to other businesses, including
Aerospace Corp., a private, nonprofit spinoff created in 1960 to
coordinate the ICBM program, after other aerospace companies
complained that TRW had become both a manager and a competitor.</TE>

<HD>State's Job Market Jumps in January</HD>
<DH>Economy: The news isn't all good. California's unemployment
rate inches up, and O.C.'s is the highest in six years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON and STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providing hope that much of California is coming out of its economic
lull, officials reported Friday that the state gained 30,200 jobs in
January, the biggest monthly increase in a year.</LD>
<LD>   The news in the jobs report wasn't all upbeat. The state's
unemployment rate crept higher, and the jobless rate in Orange County
rose to its highest level in six years.</LD>
<LD>   Although it remains one of the lowest in the state, Orange
County's jobless rate climbed to 3.8% from a minuscule 2.4% in the
same month last year, signaling that the local economic engine is
losing some of its steam.</LD>
<TE>   The state's unemployment rate climbed to 6.2% in January, up from
6.1% the previous two months, reaching its highest level in more than
four years. By contrast, the national jobless rate fell to 5.6% last
month from 5.8% in December.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts said the California unemployment figure was pushed
up not by layoffs but an influx of new job hunters who had dropped
off the state's radar screen--a phenomenon that often signals the
beginning of recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's figures, which also included a reassessment of last
year's economic performance, showed that December's job market was
better than previously reported, with California picking up 10,900
jobs. Earlier, officials reported that the state lost 600 jobs in
December, following losses in each of the three previous months.</TE>
<TE>   January's job gains were spread across a variety of industries,
including services, retailing, construction, government and
non-durable goods manufacturing. Analysts said the net job growth
points to the resilience of the California economy, and provides more
evidence that the downturn may be short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just tremendous," said Howard L. Roth, chief economist
for the California Department of Finance. "You'd be hard-pressed to
say this [is] an economy in recession."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, unemployment remained at 6.3% for a second
consecutive month.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County's 3.8% jobless rate, which is not adjusted for
seasonal factors, can be traced in part to the loss of retail jobs
after the holiday season. The rate stood at 3.2% in December.</TE>
<TE>   The county's higher rate also reflects layoffs in such sectors as
manufacturing and high tech, economists said. Yet the county added
16,600 jobs over the last 12 months--a meager growth rate of
1.2%--but one of the few to show a gain, economists noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Economic growth has slowed down, but Orange County is not in
recession,'' said Esmael Adibi, an economist at Chapman University.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego's jobless rate, also one of the lowest in the state,
rose to 3.9% last month from 3.3% in December.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in the jobless level was widespread, with 57 of
California's 58 counties reporting increases. Still, the Bay Area
continues to be the state's weakest region. Largely because of the
relative strength of the overall Southern California
economy--particularly in the counties surrounding Los Angeles--the
state has lost less momentum than the rest of the country since the
U.S. recession began in March.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Roth said it is debatable whether California actually
ever fell into recession. Although there is no formal definition of a
state recession, it normally is a period of six months of continuing
job losses.</TE>
<TE>   Roth's upbeat outlook stemmed in part from an additional
employment report released Friday, an annual reassessment of
employment figures known as "benchmarking." The new figures showed
that California did not lose jobs in back-to-back quarters, as had
been thought, and that the state overall lost fewer jobs than
previous calculations.</TE>
<TE>   The official job loss figure for 2001 stands at 26,100, versus the
previously reported decline of 38,100.</TE>
<TE>   The last time California's jobless rate matched last month's level
was in October 1997, when it also was 6.2%. The state employment
figures, and the numbers for Los Angeles County, are adjusted for
seasonal trends such as the January layoff after the holiday season.
The figures for other counties are not adjusted, in part because of
the small sampling on which those estimates are based.</TE>
<TE>   Among other Southern California counties, whose rates are not
adjusted for seasonal trends, the jobless rates were as follows:
Riverside, 5.6% last month, up from 5.0% in December and 4.9% a year
earlier. San Bernardino, 5.3% last month, up from 4.5% in December
and 4.7% a year earlier. Ventura, 5.4% last month, up from 5.0% in
December and 4.6% a year earlier.</TE>

<LD>The Super Bowl of bobsledding ends today. The four-man event, a
400-foot drop over 15 curves that starts at an elevation of nearly
7,500 feet and slides past an expected 13,000 spectators, will run
the last two heats with Todd Hays and his teammates on the USA-1 sled
in first place.</LD>
<LD>   Hays, who barely missed a bronze in the two-man event, will be
aiming to break a 46-year Olympic medal drought for U.S. men's
bobsled.</LD>
<LD>   Hays' lead is 0.09 of a second over both the Switzerland-1 and
Germany-2 sleds. Germany's Christoph Langen, who won gold in the
two-man and is the defending four-man Olympic champion, injured his
heel and is in sixth.</LD>

the United States, the main bright spot, Bode Miller, will take a
shot at a third medal.</LD>
<LD>   Miller has won silver in the combined and the giant slalom and is
shooting for gold in the slalom. In the events in which Miller won
the silver, the golds went to two of the top skiers at these

<HD>Four-Man Sled Halfway Home on Medal Quest</HD>
<DH>After coming up short for 46 years, U.S. has high hopes
with Hays in the driver's seat. Final runs are today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY TEMKIN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Todd Hays was a man of almost no words Friday, but his silence spoke
loud and clear. Hays had talked to the media through most of the
Olympic Games, even after a mediocre first-day performance in the
two-man bobsled left him in fifth place last Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Friday in the first two runs of the four-man competition at Utah
Olympic Park, the American driver recorded the fastest times in both
heats for a total time of 1:33.26. That gave him a .09-second lead
over Switzerland's Martin Annen and Germany's Andre Lange.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward Hays told an Olympic media liaison: "We have to
concentrate on [today's] races. I feel great. This is a four-heat
competition, and we have two heats left to go."</LD>
<TE>   And after that elementary math lesson, he was gone. This sudden
shyness was understandable, if only because U.S. Olympic bobsled
competitors have proved repeatedly that they lose focus at their own
peril. If Hays ever forgets that, two of the guys who sit behind him
no doubt will provide helpful reminders.</TE>
<TE>   Brakeman Garrett Hines and push athlete Randy Jones were on Brian
Shimer's sled in 1998 at Nagano when they missed a bronze medal by
.02 of a second after the sled mysteriously lost speed just before
the finish line. And Hines was Hays' brakeman Sunday when they missed
a bronze medal by .03 of a second despite strong runs in Heats 3 and
4.</TE>
<TE>   Those misadventures stretched the U.S. men's Olympic bobsled medal
drought to 46 years. With a somewhat comfortable 0.38-second lead
over fourth-place Christian Reich of Switzerland, Hays, Hines, Jones
and Bill Schuffenhauer appear set to end that dry spell, but Hines
has learned all too painfully not to count on that.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to concentrate on each heat at a time," he said.
"Even though we're excited and happy with our finish today, we know
it's not over by any means. It's going to be a dogfight. That's the
way we have to look at it."</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old Hines, was so upset after just missing a medal in
1998 he quit the sport for a year and then switched pilots from
Shimer to Hays. After Sunday's near-miss, Hines was too upset to
talk, and Friday he acknowledged he is tired of having a medal slip
away.</TE>
<TE>   "I want it real bad," he said. "It means a lot of different
things."</TE>
<TE>   One of them, he said, is that he and Jones would become the first
African-American men to win a Winter Games medal. Tuesday, Vonetta
Flowers of the U.S. became the first African-American athlete to win
a Winter Games gold medal when she served as brakeman for Jill Bakken
in the inaugural women's bobsled event.</TE>
<TE>   "To win any medal, let alone a gold, would be a big accomplishment
for both of us," Hines said.</TE>
<TE>   Five-time Olympian Shimer and his crew of Mike Kohn, Doug Sharp
and Dan Steele, were fifth in 1:33.65, which put them .3 of a second
from a medal despite producing just the 17th-best start in their
first run and the 12th best in Heat 2.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we've got to find some time at the start," Shimer said.
"Everything else seems to be working. This is my track. Nobody's
going to beat me down driving."</TE>
<TE>   Germany's Christoph Langen, who won the two-man gold medal Sunday,
was sixth in 1:33.68 after an uncharacteristically poor first run
left him seventh. Langen also injured his left foot and was uncertain
about his availability for today.</TE>

<HD>Canada Takes Out Belarus, 7-1</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>This is the way it was supposed to go for Canada. The top players in
the NHL scoring goals to put Team Canada in the gold-medal game, just
the way a hockey-crazed country expected. Or rather, demanded.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadians will play the United States for gold after defeating
Belarus, 7-1, in the first semifinal game Friday at the E Center.
Canada hasn't won an Olympic gold medal in 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   "It means a lot to the whole country," Canadian captain Mario
Lemieux said. "We are proud Canadians. Hockey is our sport back home.
Everybody plays and loves to watch it. For us to have the chance
right now to do something special for our country is something we can
all cherish for a long time if we win a gold medal."</LD>
<TE>   Among the criticism Team Canada has faced was that some of the
biggest names in hockey weren't scoring. Scratch that one after Eric
Lindros, Jarome Iginla and Simon Gagne recorded their first goals of
the tournament. Paul Kariya scored his second goal and wore his first
postgame smile as he trekked back to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to finally get a few goals and open things up a little
bit," said Kariya, the star of the Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   When Lindros scored his goal on a power play in the third period,
he celebrated by whacking his stick on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "If you keep hacking in front of the net, sooner or later the
tree's gonna drop," Lindros said. "We've been snake-bit around that
net a little bit.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of guys that have done a lot of good things, that
hasn't necessarily shown up in the scorebook."</TE>
<TE>   Belarus took out previously undefeated Sweden in the
quarterfinals, and it appeared as if it might have a little magic
left for Friday. Canadian defenseman Al MacInnis' clearing pass
caromed off a skate toward Belarus defenseman Ruslan Salei, who hit a
slap shot that beat Canada goalie Martin Brodeur and tied the score,
1-1.</TE>
<TE>   But Eric Brewer put Canada ahead four minutes later, and the
deluge began. Canada outshot Belarus, 51-14.</TE>
<TE>   "At 1-1, I'm sure everyone was going, 'Here we go again,'"
Canadian forward Theo Fleury said. "But we got 50-some-odd shots.
With the amount of talent in our room, the puck is eventually going
to go in the net."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadians will place better than they did at Nagano, where
they lost to the Czech Republic in a shootout in a semifinal. Now,
after five decades, they have a chance to end their gold-medal
drought.</TE>
<TE>   "It weighs a little bit," Lindros said. "We've certainly thought
about it. Four years ago today, we were in shock. Things were rolling
around in our favor, everything was going our way. We were playing
well. Then all of a sudden we found ourselves in a shootout. It seems
like 30 seconds later we were thinking about our travel arrangements
to head home."</TE>
<TE>   Iginla, in his sixth season with the Calgary Flames, did not play
in the 1998 Olympics. At times he looked a little overwhelmed in the
early rounds, and the NHL's leading scorer--35 goals through the
break--had little impact.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't really too worried," Iginla said. "Things have worked
out really well. We've won a lot of close games. Tonight it did feel
good to get [a goal] though. It felt good to be able to score one in
the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Brodeur, of the New Jersey Devils, is coming through in goal,
which was a worry for Canada after Patrick Roy of the Colorado
Avalanche decided not to play.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some people who turned us down," Canadian Coach Pat Quinn
said. "The guys that came here hopefully will be rewarded."</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, which made a run from the qualifying round to the
semifinals, can win a bronze medal with a victory over Russia today.
Not bad for a team with only one NHL player.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot for our country, so I'm really tired," Belarussian
goalie Andrei Mezin said. "We shouldn't be upset."</TE>
<TE>   That's a difference between playing for Belarus and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not satisfied," Canadian center Joe Sakic of the Colorado
Avalanche said. "You win the gold medal and then there'll be relief."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Wins the Goal War</HD>
<DH>The men's hockey team squeezes by, 3-2, after a
third-period onslaught by Russia. One opponent remains: Canada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It might take another 22 years just to get their breath back.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. men's hockey team was still standing Friday night, its
Olympic gold-medal hopes still alive, its 24-game unbeaten streak in
Olympic Games on home ice still intact.</LD>
<LD>   Barely.</LD>
<TE>   And only after withstanding a furious charge from Russia in the
last period of a 3-2 victory that closed with 20 minutes of
exhilarating, nerve-rattling hockey in a game that took place on the
22nd anniversary of the United States' "Miracle on Ice" against the
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Even Jeremy Roenick, one of the most quotable players on the U.S.
roster, said: "I'm beyond words right now."</TE>
<TE>   It was as if the Russians tried to take out two decades' and two
periods' worth of frustration at the end. If they couldn't erase the
memories of their country's most infamous loss, they did their best
to wipe out the United States' three-goal lead.</TE>
<TE>   Only the quick reflexes of goalie Mike Richter and a favorable
bounce off the goal post prevented them from succeeding and enabled
the United States to move on to the gold-medal game against Canada on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Coach Slava Fetisov also seemed to believe the
International Ice Hockey Federation and the NHL brought about the
matchup.</TE>
<TE>   "It was designed to have this final between Canada and the United
States," Fetisov said.</TE>
<TE>   There was definitely an air of Cold War subterfuge surrounding
this game. It came a day after the Russians threatened to pull out of
the Olympics because of perceived bias against them by officials and
governing bodies. It came a few hours after the Russian Olympic
Committee demanded a second gold medal for Irina Slutskaya, the
runner-up to American Sarah Hughes in the women's figure skating
competition.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, however the Americans dominated play. They outshot
Russia, 20-4, in the first period and 18-7 in the second. Goalie
Nikolai Khabibulin did his best to keep his team in the game. He
stopped 46 shots overall, and the Americans could not beat him at
even strength.</TE>
<TE>   But they did get a power-play goal late in the first period and
two more power-play goals in the second.</TE>
<TE>   First, Bill Guerin caught a rebound as he skated from left to
right and fired it into the net with a little more than four minutes
left in the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Seven-and-a-half minutes into the second period, Khabibulin
deflected a Scott Young shot with his stick, but the puck went high
into the air and came down right in front of the crossbar, then
landed across the goal line for a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   On another power play 10 minutes later, Tony Amonte fired a shot
at Khabibulin that was so hard the rebound went out to the top of the
faceoff circle. Phil Housley swooped in, collected the puck and
zipped a shot past Khabibulin into the upper left corner of the net.</TE>
<TE>   "I just saw Tony take a whack at it," Housley said. "I was on the
weak side. I just tried to control the puck--it was hopping--and take
a shot on net."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans took plenty of shots throughout the first two
periods while the Russians played timidly.</TE>
<TE>   Russia showed that the third period would be different from the
outset. A dump-in deflected off a stick, rattled off the boards and
came out to Alexei Kovalev, who beat Richter 11 seconds in.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans spent the first 31/2 minutes pinned in their own
zone, while Russia fired off five unanswered shots.</TE>
<TE>   At the 3:21 mark, Vladimir Malakhov fired a slap shot from the
blue line that beat Richter and cut the U.S. lead to 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   After managing only 11 shots on goal in the first two periods, the
Russians matched that number within the first nine minutes of the
third.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of guys coming at you full speed," U.S. center Mike
Modano said. "They're very dangerous with the puck."</TE>
<TE>   It was getting frantic. Richter scrambled to stop one wraparound
shot, only to have his stick lodge beneath the net. He lifted the net
and grabbed his stick just in time to use it to stop yet another
Russian shot.</TE>
<TE>   "You know you're playing Russia, they're not going to roll over
and die for you in the last period," Richter said. "It was getting
ugly out there. You are trying to control the rebounds with the puck
jumping all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   A little past the halfway mark of the period, Russian forward Ilya
Kovalchuk just missed from the right side, and Sergei Samsonov's shot
off the rebound hit the post and bounced across the crease.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians thought it had crossed the goal line. They pointed at
the giant replay screen above the other end of the ice and wanted a
video review. It wasn't granted, one of numerous complaints the
Russians had about the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely, they didn't help us," said Fetisov, who blamed the
tournament's use of NHL officials.</TE>
<TE>   "They live here. They know the players, they're Americans, they're
Canadian. In a crucial situation, it's human reaction. They're not
going to call it."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans were too caught up in the wave of emotion and
patriotism to worry about officiating. This might be the closest
they'll get to experiencing the excitement of Lake Placid in 1980.
The 8,600-seat E Center buzzed during every faceoff in the final two
minutes, with fans standing, cheering and waving flags</TE>
<TE>   "You know the country's watching, and there's a lot of pride,"
Young said. "It's a really a special feeling to hear that U-S-A
chant. It goes back a lot of years, watching on TV, and now we're
here experiencing it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was great. We could hear it. We were a little too focused on
the game to be looking around in the stands and noticing particular
things. But we could hear it. They were there, they were behind us,
and it was a great atmosphere."</TE>
<TE>   It should be even louder Sunday, when the United States tries to
extend its 21-0-3 run on home ice that dates to the 1932 Lake Placid
Games, while Canada tries to end a gold-medal drought that dates to
1952.</TE>
<TE>   "You know it's going to be a good, North American brand of
hockey," U.S. forward Brett Hull said.</TE>

<TE>   The purpose of the Olympics, simply put, is to foster peace. Young
athletes from around the world are brought together in a
non-political setting in order to meet, enjoy their youth and mutual
talent, and hopefully to take some good feelings home with them.
Keeping a running tally of medals is in complete opposition to this
purpose. In fact, awarding medals at all may be the worst error.</TE>
<TE>   Why can't this one meet be set aside as a display of ability,
rather than as a life-and-death competition? That way if a skater
slips once in a four-minute program, 10 years of work are not thrown
out the window. It's just a slip.</TE>
<TE>   The ice shows can still hire whomever they want. The skaters can
still duke it out for endorsements in other competitions. Let this
one event, the Olympics, be what it was intended to be.</TE>

<TE>   Olympic figure skating fans have seen many years of judging
nonsense--the most ridiculous was Torvill and Dean having to settle
for bronze in '94, while Russians were magically blessed with both
gold and silver.</TE>
<TE>   Other recent questionable Olympic results: Alexei Urmanov over
Elvis Stojko ('94), Viktor Petrenko over Paul Wylie ('92), Oksana
Baiul over Nancy Kerrigan ('94), Katarina Witt over Elizabeth Manley
('88), Klimova/Ponomarenko over the Duchesnays ('92). Hell, the
Ukrainian judge who was suspended in '98, after being caught on tape
telling the finish for the Nagano dance competition before skating
had even begun, is back at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   In Olympic pairs and dance, whenever it's close, somehow the
Eastern Bloc skaters manage to win--and not because they have been
better every time. The exposure of corruption in figure skating
judging is long overdue, and real change needs desperately to follow.
My fear is that officials will simply try to better hide the stink.</TE>
<TE>   Vicki Bartmess</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable that the parents of Russian skaters Anton
Sikharulidze and Elena Berezhnaya are shocked at the prompt,
independent and just decisions of the International Skating Union and
the International Olympic Committee to correct an admitted instance
of judging misconduct. The abuses of judges rendering decisions
influenced by the government and other administrators, and the
resigned acceptance of that system, was the essence of the Soviet
political world in which those parents grew up. While perhaps they
can't help it, we can only hope that their children's generation sees
the wisdom of publicly righting an official wrong.</TE>

<TE>   Bill Plaschke criticizes the award of the second pair of Olympic
figure skating gold medals because vote-rigging by Marie Reine Le
Gougne was "only an accusation" and due process hadn't been served.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute! In The Times' own front-sports page "From Silver to
Gold" chronology, under "Thursday, Maneuvering," it's asserted that
Le Gougne told the head of the International Skating Union she had,
indeed, "submitted to a certain pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Which is it, Mr. Plaschke, did Le Gougne admit the truth of the
accusation or didn't she? If she did admit to submitting, what part
of your due process has been failed?</TE>
<TE>   Bill Hoffine</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschke has it all wrong! The easy way out for the IOC would
have been the way His Excellency Good-Old-Boy Samaranch would have
handled it: Investigate it to death, hand it back to the ISU and
watch while nothing happens for 20 years or more and hope it goes
away.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Rogge, although still a bit too Eurocentric for my tastes, has
put his stamp on the IOC early and hard. I just hope it will be a
lasting change that comes about.</TE>

<TE>   At first I didn't understand why ice dancing is considered an
Olympic sport. But after watching several nights of big hair, strange
costumes and disco dancing, all set to bad music, I now realize it
exists simply as an attempt to legitimize the pairs event. One night
they're dressed up as matadors, the next day they look like extras
from the Ice Capades rendition of "Les Miserables."</TE>
<TE>   Any event (let's not call it a sport) in which the contestants
(let's not call them athletes) have hair-weaves and wear theatrical
makeup cheapens the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   That scowling French woman with the flaming-red hair who "won" the
competition was the first sign of the apocalypse.</TE>

<TE>   Due to a race official's error--whether it was intentional, we'll
never know--my son was deprived of his place on the winner's stand.
We know first place was rightfully his, because we defeated the
"winner" three times in unofficial races.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? Whine about it? Demand a do-over? Or sue, with the
hope that the championship might be stripped from the declared winner
and presented to my son in a special, hollow ceremony?</TE>
<TE>   With wisdom and grace that belie his 8 years of age, my son chose
to let the matter pass, even though he had prepared for years. His
outlook--that even good people sometimes do the wrong thing, and that
there shall be other races--will serve him well; indeed far better
than a trophy ever will.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Olympic figure skaters, rather than whining about the
results, and seeking redress after the fact, he'll make sure the
playing field is level before next year's competition. After all, the
stakes are just as high in the Cub Scout Pinewood Derby.</TE>

However, Wayne Gretzky's whining has changed my thought process.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky can cry all he wants about how everyone wants Canada to
lose and how European teams beat up on the poor Canada squad, but the
fact is, all of Canada should be crying about the team Gretzky picked
to represent his country. Where the heck is Joe Thornton? Where is
Patrick Roy? Gretzky should have stroked Roy's ego just to get him

electric downhill run Franz Klammer put together to come from behind
and win the gold medal in 1976. That and the three gold medals Jean
Claude-Killy won back in the late '60s.</TE>
<TE>   But had those events been covered by American television then the
way Olympics are these days, we would be saying, "Franz who?", "Jean
Claude-what?" Instead, we would have found out about the courageous
16th-place finish by the best American competitor.</TE>
<TE>   Franz Klammer is a household name to those who saw that race. This
year's American skiers will be as well known a year from now as the
loser of the Super Bowl. The Olympics have devolved from sports
coverage to personality coverage, from Sports Illustrated to People
magazine.</TE>

<TE>   The IOC and U.S. Olympic Committee should correct the gravest of
injustices ever. They should apologize to Tommy Smith and John Carlos
for their reaction to these American athletes' peaceful and truthful
display of conscience.</TE>

the Olympics.</TE>

<HD>Lajunen Completes Golden Sweep</HD>
<DH>Finn wins sprint for third gold medal. American Lodwick
moves up to fifth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>As much as he'd rather avoid the subject, Samppa Lajunen's run toward
Olympic gold began last April, when the great Bjarte Engen Vik of
Norway suddenly announced his retirement.</LD>
<LD>   With Vik out of the picture, there was no one to stop Lajunen from
running the table at the Salt Lake City Games.</LD>
<LD>   The 22-year-old Finn completed a sweep of the three Nordic
combined events Friday by winning the gold medal in the sprint,
fulfilling the potential he showed when he won his first World Cup
event at 17.</LD>
<TE>   "That was the year when I was surprised," he said. "Now I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   After leading Thursday's ski-jumping competition on the big hill
at Olympic Park, Lajunen began the 7.5-kilometer cross-country race
at Soldier Hollow 15 seconds ahead of Germany's Ronny Ackermann.
Lajunen maintained the cushion and finished in 16 minutes 40.1
seconds--nine seconds ahead of Ackermann.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Gottwald of Austria moved up eight spots to take the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Lodwick started 12th and finished fifth, the best showing
ever by an American in the sport. The previous best was Lodwick's
seventh-place finish in the individual competition on Feb. 10.</TE>
<TE>   "To be recognized as one of the best in the world is great,"
Lodwick said, but added, "I would have loved to have had a medal and
put Nordic combined in the history books with my name beside it."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other Americans, Bill Demong finished 14th, Johnny
Spillane 32nd and Matt Dayton 36th.</TE>
<TE>   Lajunen won silver in both Nordic combined events four years ago,
losing to Vik and his stunningly long jumps. Vik won two world titles
last year, then announced his retirement less than two months later,
at 30. "I lack the motivation to continue," Vik said.</TE>
<TE>   Lajunen certainly was motivated at these Winter Games. He won the
individual race by 24.7 seconds, and the margin would have been
larger had he not stayed with teammate Jaakko Tallus, urging him to
the silver. Six days later, Lajunen anchored the winning team in the
relay.</TE>
<TE>   "He was waiting for his first gold medal quite long, and he was
working very hard," Gottwald said. "Three times gold is amazing."</TE>
<TE>   Gottwald, ranked No. 1 in the world this season, said Vik's
retirement opened the door for several competitors, but Lajunen is
the one who burst through.</TE>
<TE>   His victory in the sprint, which made its debut at these Games,
made Lajunen the first Finnish athlete to win three gold medals at
one Olympics since ski jumper Matti Nykanen in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Lajunen, who dyed his blond hair powder blue for the Olympics but
let his teammates shave his head the night before his last race,
became a bit defensive when asked whether Vik's departure established
him as the Olympic favorite.</TE>
<TE>   "You are looking too much just at Olympic races," he said. "You
have to take a wider look at all competitions. It has been very
difficult to win competitions. You have to jump very, very well and
after that you have to ski the best skiing times of all if you want
to win competitions."</TE>
<TE>   Lodwick began 56 seconds behind the leader but just five seconds
behind Gottwald. Knowing Gottwald is an exceptional skier, Lodwick
stayed with him for most of the race, and even moved all the way up
to third at one point before Gottwald passed him on the first hill of
the final lap.</TE>

<HD>Belarussian Skater Summoned by IOC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A short-track speedskater from Belarus who abruptly left the Winter
Olympics after steroids were found in her system was called before an
IOC inquiry Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Yulia Pavlovich, who checked out of the Olympic Village on Monday
rather than submit to another test for nandrolone, was to be
questioned by a panel of the IOC's executive board, an Olympic source
familiar with the situation told the Associated Press on the
condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the International Olympic Committee awaited word on
urine samples taken from a Russian cross-country skiing star who was
disqualified from a race Thursday because of high hemoglobin levels.</LD>
<TE>   There was no word on when the test results from Larissa Lazutina
would be received. Generally, testing is completed within 24-36 hours
and the IOC then has an additional 36 hours to finish the process
before declaring a positive test.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlovich vanished from village housing after failing to show up
for a second test, which was ordered by the IOC after a broken seal
on the sample bag invalidated the original exam. The IOC barred her
from further competition at Salt Lake City pending an investigation
and punished the Belarus Olympic committee for allegedly helping the
athlete avoid another exam.</TE>
<TE>   The first test found levels of nandrolone 380 times the legal
limit, the IOC said. But the Salt Lake City Games remain free of a
doping case because the broken seal, an apparent accident by a lab
courier, meant the sample might be contaminated and thus could not be
used.</TE>
<TE>   Belarussian Sports and Tourism Minister Yevgeny Vorsin said
Tuesday that Pavlovich had been sent away from the village by team
leadership "at her coach's suggestion," and that the test results may
have been produced by "medical help" received from team personnel
last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Pavlovich finished 19th in the 1,500 meters and 23rd in the 500
meters, which preceded her drug test last Saturday night. She had
been scheduled to compete in the 1,000 on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC executive board suspended the Belarussian committee for
the rest of this year from grants and other support generally worth
about $120,000 annually. It also kicked Belarussian team leader
Yaroslav Barichko out of the Games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake's Olympic bid chief, who lavished $1 million in cash and
favors on International Olympic Committee delegates and family
members, says it wasn't bribery.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a quid pro quo. It wasn't, 'I'll give you this, you
give me that,'" Tom Welch told "60 Minutes" for a broadcast planned
Sunday, the final day of the city's Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   In a transcript of the interview, Welch said he had no choice but
to lavish gifts and favors on International Olympic Committee
members, just as other bid cities were doing.</TE>
<TE>   He called it "a process of excess from beginning to end."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the U.S. Justice Department appealed a decision that
threw out 15 felony charges of bribery racketeering, fraud and
conspiracy against Welch and his deputy, Dave Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "A bribe is when I offer to give you something and in return you
give me something," Welch told "60 Minutes" correspondent Mike
Wallace. "These guys were never asked for their votes. Their votes
were never promised."</TE>
<TE>   IOC members vote by secret ballot to designate Olympic cities, and
Welch has said he never really knew who gave their vote for Salt Lake
City.</TE>

<LD>Feb. 22, 1980, versus Feb. 22, 2002--a tale of two U.S.-Russia
Olympic hockey semifinals:</LD>
<LD>   1980: Amid Cold War posturing and threats of Olympic boycotts, the
big game faces off in Lake Placid.</LD>
<LD>   2002: Amid Cold War posturing and threats of Olympic boycotts, the

way to neutralize the play of Slava Fetisov.</TE>
<TE>   2002: Herb Brooks is behind the American bench, trying to find a
way to neutralize the players of Slava Fetisov.</TE>
<TE>   1980: Americans play with a vengeance, having much to prove after
embarrassing themselves in a 10-3 loss to the Russians at Madison
Square Garden three days before the start of the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   2002: Americans play with a vengeance, having much to prove after
embarrassing themselves in a room-trashing fiasco four years before
at the Nagano Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   1980: As the final seconds wind down on the Americans' 4-3
victory, Al Michaels declares, "Do you believe in miracles?"</TE>
<TE>   2002: As the final seconds wind down on the Americans' 3-2
victory, everyone watching declares, "Do you believe the Russians
haven't protested yet?"</TE>
<TE>   Nice try, 2002, but I'll still stick with the original.</TE>
<TE>   It can be a little dodgy, trying to re-create history 22 years
down the line. It wasn't nearly as bad as, say, the "Brian's Song"
remake, but the longer you watched, you couldn't help noticing what
was missing. Namely:</TE>
<TE>   * The Americans' gutty little underdog status. Hard to rally much
us-against-Goliath passion when our tattered slingshots have been
replaced by Brett Hull, Mike Modano and 18 other NHL
multimillionaires--some of them the same louts who embarrassed the
sport and the Western Hemisphere with their
who-can-be-the-ugliest-American act in Japan in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   * Mike Eruzione, Jim Craig and the gang. All the names have
changed, as you would have expected. Hard to stay in playing shape
for 22 years when every time you meet someone new, he wants to buy
you a beer. As we saw during the opening ceremony, when they all
gathered at the top of Rice-Eccles Stadium to light the Olympic
caldron.</TE>
<TE>   Took our breath away. And theirs as well.</TE>
<TE>   * Red Russians. What happened to the Big Red Machine? The Red
Menace? The feared red uniforms that used to send shudders through
the arena whenever the Mighty Soviets lumbered onto the ice?</TE>
<TE>   In what appeared to be an underhanded, devious attempt to confuse
American fans, Team Russia 2002 skated out in knockoffs of the same
uniforms worn by the Miracle on Ice Americans of 1980--white jerseys
with blue and red trim. Which team were we supposed to root for--the
red, white and blue or the red, white and blue?</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Mike Richter look perplexed when he let in that goal by
Vladimir Malakhov. He must have thought they were teammates. And, it
says here, they will be, next week, when they return to practice
again with the New York Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   Sad lesson to be learned: You can't go home again, even when
you're home again.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, every time a Russian player was sent to the penalty box,
all of America held its breath and wondered, "Is this finally the
break we need?"</TE>
<TE>   In 2002, every time a Russian player was sent to the penalty box,
all of America held its breath and wondered, "Does this mean the
Russians will be boycotting the closing ceremony?"</TE>
<TE>   The Russians, as you know, are protesting everything here.
Thursday, they demanded duplicate gold medals for their disqualified
women's cross-country ski team. (Because if they hadn't been
disqualified, the Russians argued, they were certain to win the
race.) Friday, they demanded a duplicate gold medal for figure skater
Irina Slutskaya. (Because, the Russians argued, Slutskaya had been
victimized by "nonobjective judging," same as the Canadian pairs
skaters. And look what they got.)</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's hockey semifinal, the Russians were penalized six
times for 12 minutes, the Americans four times for eight minutes.
More glaringly, at least from the Russian perspective, all three U.S.
goals were scored while the Russians were playing short-handed.</TE>
<TE>   (The Russians were penalized once for tripping, once for roughing,
once for interference and three times for high sulking.)</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, Fetisov didn't stop the game to pull his players off
the ice, remove his shoe and start banging it angrily on the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he couldn't refrain from the obligatory hint of a
Western conspiracy, telling reporters afterward that "an agreement's
been signed that is designed to have a final between Canada and the
USA. You have this final, you have NHL referees.... They live here
and they know the North American players."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it will be the U.S. and Canada in Sunday's final. There was
no stopping the Canadians, whose path to the gold-medal game appears
to be rigged as well.</TE>
<TE>   Canada beat Belarus, 7-1, in the other semifinal. That wouldn't
have been the score if Sweden had played Canada--Sweden won its
group-play matchup, 5-2--but the Swedes were upset by the
Belarussians in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Which means Sweden and Belarus, along with the Olympic hockey
referees, must have been in on the deal. Thank goodness the Games
come to end Sunday. The conspiracies here are growing larger by the
minute.</TE>

<LD>This should have been about a gesture of strength.</LD>
<LD>   It was, instead, about a gesture of obscenity.</LD>
<LD>   This should have been about newfound character.</LD>
<TE>   It was, instead, about alleged cheating.</TE>
<TE>   This should have been a hockey game, darn it.</TE>
<TE>   It was, instead, was another reason why last week's decision by
the International Olympic Committee has made some games here
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The news Friday, you would think, was that the United States men's
hockey team rushed to a 3-0 lead and then braced itself during a
furious third-period comeback to win a 3-2 decision over Russia in
the Olympic semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years to the day after the legendary U.S. "Miracle on
Ice" victory over the Soviet Union, the two teams played another game
that ended in dancing and collapsing.</TE>
<TE>   All of which set up what may be the most watched hockey game in
history, Sunday afternoon, a gold-medal brawl between Canada and the
U.S., a match between the game's inventors and the neighbor kids who
are trying to steal it.</TE>
<TE>   That should have been the news Friday.</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Because these are still the Winter Olympics. And the losers were
again the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   And for the remaining few days of these Olympics, everything
Russia touches will turn to controversy.</TE>
<TE>   This was the country that was steamrollered last week when the IOC
bowed to public pressure and unsubstantiated allegations, awarding a
second gold medal in the pairs figure skating to a Canadian couple
while forcing a Russian couple to share the podium.</TE>
<TE>   This is the country that has not gotten over that slight and has
been trying to exact revenge ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials have pounded on desks, threatening boycotts,
asking for double gold medals in cross-country skiing and figure
skating, begging for public apologies, hoping to be embraced by
public opinion.</TE>
<TE>   But until Friday, it was all nothing more than noise.</TE>
<TE>   Then the game started, and it became apparent that the flames of
the controversy had turned inward, engulfing athletes and their
attitudes.</TE>
<TE>   A pretty good hockey team became an unwitting group of political
pawns.</TE>
<TE>   All those people who thought the IOC did the right thing last week
by kowtowing to NBC and the North American media should have been
here.</TE>
<TE>   The game was contested in what is formally called The E Center.</TE>
<TE>   But in reality, it was played in the mouth of Pandora's Box.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone remaining in this Olympics feels now that the squeaky
wheel will get the (greasy) medal.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what happens when that wheel eventually falls off.</TE>
<TE>   The slow Russian start, in which they were outshot, 11-1, at the
beginning of the game and 35-11 after two periods despite dominating
the Americans in last week's tie?</TE>
<TE>   It was blamed on distraction from threatened boycott.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of disruptive," Coach Slava Fetisov said.</TE>
<TE>   The quick Russian finish, in which they scored two quick goals and
forced goalie Mike Richter to hang on by the skin of scarred knees?</TE>
<TE>   It was overshadowed by anger at the referees.</TE>
<TE>   "It was designed to be a Canada-U.S. final," Fetisov said. "These
are NHL referees."</TE>
<TE>   And this was a mess.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians thought Sergei Samsonov's shot across the front of
the goal midway through the third period should have been
reviewed--even though replays showed it was no goal. They banged
their sticks on the boards and Fetisov screamed.</TE>
<TE>   "What I was trying to do was to gain some time and give the
referees a chance to review it," Fetisov said.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians also thought Chris Chelios should have been assessed
a penalty for hitting Samsonov above the shoulders, much like Darius
Kasparaitis was penalized in the second period for a similar hit.
That penalty led to the second U.S. goal.</TE>
<TE>   "[That was] a deliberate hit in the head and supposed to be
penalized," Fetisov said.</TE>
<TE>   When the game finally ended, after Jeremy Roenick had won two big
face-offs and Richter had stopped 17 third-period shots, the Russians
were the sorest of losers.</TE>
<TE>   Angry, paranoid, and still distracted.</TE>
<TE>   While the U.S. team was skating off the ice, Kasparaitis was
skating around the officials, screaming.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, after nearly everyone had left the ice, Kasparaitis
grabbed himself in an obscene gesture before departing.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we have a big disagreement with the Olympic committee,"
Fetisov said. "They're professional referees, they live here, they
know the players, Americans and Canadians. I know, in crucial
situations, it's human reaction, in those situations they are not
going to call it a penalty. There's not much you can do right now."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, there is still a human situation here? It didn't feel much
like it Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it will return Sunday, when the final Olympic event could be
its most emotional.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has not won a gold medal in 50 years. It has lost two NHL
teams to the United States. Barely half of the NHL players come from
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "I know there's a lot of pressure on us," Canada's Jarome Iginla
said. "I remember, when I wasn't part of the team, I was putting
pressure on them too. Everybody in the country is watching us and
pulling for us."</TE>
<TE>   There is, however, also pressure on the U.S., which hasn't won a
medal since 1980 and is still trying to overcome the shame of 1998
and the apartment-trashing in Nagano.</TE>
<TE>   "It's looking us right in the face," American Doug Weight said.
"We just have to go out and take it on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   And a wonderful Sunday it will be.</TE>
<TE>   Or should be.</TE>

<HD>The Day After Victory, Hughes on a Real Roll</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Forget the Olympic figure skating gold medal she won in one of the
sport's greatest upsets.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah Hughes had a sandwich named after her Friday in her hometown
of Great Neck, N.Y.</LD>
<LD>   What greater tribute can there be?</LD>
<TE>   The Deli on the Green's "Golden Sarah Hughes" sandwich--maple
turkey, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato and Thousand Island dressing on
a roll--sounds tempting. But it can't be as much in demand as Hughes
was the day after she rallied from fourth place to upset reigning
world champion Michelle Kwan of Torrance and three-time world silver
medalist Irina Slutskaya of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, who declared she's less concerned about earning perfect
6.0s in her next competition than with reaching the high 1,500s on
her college entrance exams, slept only about two hours after her
bold, nuanced performance brought down the house and brought her to
the medals stand.</TE>
<TE>   She got an early start on a round of interviews and appearances,
before Friday night's exhibition gala.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after she finished her last combination spin, her life
changed forever. It's a prospect the articulate 16-year-old finds
enticing and, perhaps, a bit overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great to have this medal, but there's a lot of
responsibility that comes with it," said Hughes, who won the long
program, 5-4, over Slutskaya to complete the improbable series of
events that vaulted her past Kwan, Slutskaya and Sasha Cohen of
Laguna Niguel, who finished second, third and fourth, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy it, but there's a sense of responsibility I have not only
to my family, but to the skating community."</TE>
<TE>   While Russian Olympic officials, on behalf of Slutskaya, were
lodging a protest--later denied by the International Skating
Union--Hughes celebrated with her family Thursday night into Friday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   She's the fourth-oldest of six children of John Hughes, an
attorney, and Amy Hughes, an accountant turned full-time mom. They've
kept the family together--no minor feat in elite-level skating, where
it's common for young teenagers to leave home and split up their
families to train with renowned coaches. They've also kept her
grounded from the time she was a toothy tot who performed as a sort
of novelty act between periods of New York Rangers' games at Madison
Square Garden, through Thursday, when she aggressively and
confidently performed a complex program she and her coach, Robin
Wagner, reconfigured to make more difficult only a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got back to the hotel I was able to sit with my family and
have a couple of laughs," Hughes said Friday. "It was nice to see my
little sisters, and my older brothers were funny.</TE>
<TE>   "I just showed everybody my medal and they said, 'Ooh, I can't
believe how heavy it is.' I think sometimes they were more interested
in the medal than me. I was like, 'Hey guys, what about me?'"</TE>
<TE>   What about her? And what does her victory say about her and the
state of women's figure skating?</TE>
<TE>   Hughes' triumph was as dramatic as it was unlikely in an event
that produced the highest TV rating of the Salt Lake City Games. The
NBC telecast of the women's long program drew a 26.8 rating,
including 31% of viewers in the Los Angeles area and 27.6% of the New
York market. In the U.S., 79 million viewers watched at least part of
the telecast.</TE>
<TE>   They were treated to a spectacle. After her surprisingly flat
third-place finish behind Kwan and Cohen at last month's U.S.
championships at Staples Center, Hughes and Wagner were advised by
judges that Hughes' long program needed some pizazz. So did Hughes
herself.</TE>
<TE>   The duo got to work. Hughes had her short brown hair cut and
highlighted in the front with blond strands, the better to focus
attention on her expressive face. She also got a new, lavender dress
from Jef Billings that helped accentuate her long legs--at 5-3, she's
tall for a skater--and her line. Wagner redesigned her four-minute
long program to incorporate a second triple-triple and re-edited the
music of Ravel's "Daphnis et Chloe" to end the program with a
dramatic flourish.</TE>
<TE>   But that would have meant nothing if she hadn't been relaxed and
confident, an approach that was easy to take sitting in fourth place
after the short program.</TE>
<TE>   While Kwan and Slutskaya had placements to protect, Hughes had a
liberating absence of pressure. "I really had nothing to lose," she
said. "I thought there was no way in the world I could win ... so I
went out and just let it go."</TE>
<TE>   Performing second in the final group of six skaters, Hughes went
for every jump, finessed every spin, skated every stroke with
controlled power. Her two triple-triple jump combinations posed a
challenge none of her rivals could meet:</TE>
<TE>   Cohen fell on her triple-triple combination and Kwan two-footed
the first part of her combination and reduced the second part to a
double. Slutskaya did a triple salchow-double loop-half loop-double
salchow, but it was clumsily executed. She also over-rotated a triple
flip, keeping her marks for technical merit to 5.7s and 5.8s, with
one 5.9 from the Slovakian judge.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to have fun with it," Hughes said. "I always go out and
I'm so worried about whether I'm going to do this jump or that, or
whether I'm going to skate fast or spin well, and [Thursday] night I
went out and just skated.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the most important thing. I didn't realize until it was
over that that was just the greatest feeling ever. No matter what,
that was my gold-medal performance. I didn't think I dropped from
fourth, and that's pretty good, fourth at the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   But it was Kwan who dropped from first to third after Hughes was
ranked first in the long program--worth two-thirds of the overall
score--and Slutskaya placed second.</TE>
<TE>   For Kwan, 21, it was an eerie repeat of her performance at Nagano
in 1998. The favorite then, as she was at Salt Lake City, Kwan
inexplicably held back emotionally four years ago and finished with
silver, to Tara Lipinski's gold.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Kwan held back on the technical aspects of her
skating, a bad move on a night Hughes was unassailable.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little more disappointed in Nagano just because I skated
much better," Kwan said. "[Thursday] was one of those nights where it
just didn't go my way. It's different, but both times I ended up
crying."</TE>
<TE>   Her agent, Shep Goldberg, said Friday she hasn't decided whether
she will compete in the world championships next month at Nagano. She
must decide by next week to allow time for a replacement to prepare,
if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy competing," said Kwan, a six-time world champion. "I do
love the sport a lot. It gives me a lot of pleasure, a lot of joy."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said she felt a little odd ascending to a higher step on
the podium than Kwan, her childhood idol. "It's really nice when
you're little and you have all these dreams and you finally meet the
person and they don't let you down," Hughes said. "I think it was a
lot harder for her to get a bronze than for me to get a bronze."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen's coach, John Nicks, said the 17-year-old will compete at
the world meet and plans to remain in the Olympic-eligible ranks for
the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy. "It is early, but she's very excited
about her Olympic experience and she's looking forward to the next
one," Nicks said.</TE>
<TE>   By then, some other young girl--someone who might be 12 now, as
Hughes was four years ago--might have arrived on the scene. But for
now, Hughes sits atop the women's figure skating world.</TE>
<TE>   "It just felt magical out there," she said. "I didn't want it to
end."</TE>

<HD>Croatian Is Sensational</HD>
<DH>Kostelic Wins Giant Slalom for Record Fourth Ski Medal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>It's not every day you happen upon a conga line of Croatians, on
their knees, frolicking like kids in the snow.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, it's not every day an Alpine skier wins four medals in
the same Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, it had never happened until Friday, when 20-year-old
Janica Kostelic of Zagreb made tracks and then history in winning the
women's giant slalom.</LD>
<TE>   Kostelic assured her spot in Bud Greenspan's next Olympic
retrospective with another dominating performance, this time
snow-blowing away the competition with a two-run time of 2 minutes
30.01 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   She was 1.32 seconds faster than silver-medal winner Anja Paerson
of Sweden and 1.66 ahead of Switzerland's Sonja Nef, who took the
bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Of Kostelic's performance, Paerson remarked, "I wonder if she's
human."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic leaves Salt Lake City with three gold medals and one
silver.</TE>
<TE>   She won the combined, slalom and giant slalom events and missed
winning the super-giant slalom by five-hundredths of a second.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to her record-setting performance?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tired, that's how I feel now," she said. "Records are to be
beaten, so somebody's going to beat my record in the next Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Fat Croatian chance.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic made ski racing look ridiculously easy, which it isn't.</TE>
<TE>   After she raced into first place from the 19th start position in
Friday morning's run, she did one of those Michael Jordan shrugs in
the finish area--What can I say? Even I don't know how I'm doing
this.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic said later that was basically the right read of her
actions. She couldn't believe she had raced ahead of Nef, the world's
top-ranked giant slalom skier.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect that," she said. "To be in front of Sonja Nef, it
was a big thing."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic had never finished higher than fourth in a World Cup
giant slalom. She posted that result at Park City in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Team Croatia, which consists of Janica, her older
brother Ivica, and what appeared to be two-dozen ski "roadies,"
danced the day away after her win, bumping and grinding to such disco
hits as "Super Freak" and "That's the Way I Like It."</TE>
<TE>   The public-address announcer called it a "Croatian get-down
party."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women?</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, them.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, they finally met expectations at the Olympics, because
they were not expected to contend for a medal in giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Kristina Koznick, who lost her only real shot at a medal when she
crashed in the first run of Wednesday's slalom, was the top U.S.
finisher at 17th.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventeenth just doesn't do it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She ended up 4.21 seconds behind Kostelic's winning time, which in
giant slalom is like finishing a lap back in the mile run.</TE>
<TE>   Koznick now returns to the World Cup tour, where she ranks second
in slalom and still has a clear chance to win the World Cup title, a
tremendous feat in ski racing but no substitute in the U.S. for
Olympic success.</TE>
<TE>   The quick wrap on U.S. fortunes: Sarah Schleper finished 21st,
Kirsten Clark was 26th, and Alexandra Shaffer turned out the giant
slalom lights on her way down to 28th place.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. women were held without an Alpine medal for the first
time since the 1988 Calgary Games, considered the low point in the
Winter Olympic movement for the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The best showing for the U.S. women here came from 17-year-old
Lindsey Kildow, who finished a surprising sixth in the combined and
then called "tragic" the fact she had to miss her junior prom to
train for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear of failure overcame the desire for success," said U.S.
women's coach Marjan Cernigoj, acutely summing up the U.S. effort.</TE>
<TE>   The only question now in two-drink-minimum chalets across the Alps
is how to assess Kostelic's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Does she move straight to the top chairlift in terms of all-time
Olympic Alpine achievement?</TE>
<TE>   You have to qualify what she did only because the combined and
super-G were not added as events until 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Toni Sailer won gold in all three Alpine events at the
1956 Cortina Games, as did France's Jean-Claude Killy at Grenoble in
1968.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Kostelic garnered medals in four of the five available
disciplines.</TE>
<TE>   She elected not to race the downhill at Snowbasin, but it wasn't
out of trepidation. Rather, she was trying to save wear and tear on
her aching knees.</TE>
<TE>   She said she has no regrets not racing all five events.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to risk," she said. "I had the combined race in
front of me. I was going for the medal. In case something happened,
it would have been stupid."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic's performance is more remarkable considering that serious
injuries had made her an also-ran on this year's World Cup circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic entered the Salt Lake Games ranked No. 30 in giant
slalom, No. 14 in super-G, No. 12 in slalom and No. 13 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Because of doubts about her injuries and conditioning, most
experts considered her a medal contender only in the combined.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic was only 19 when she won the World Cup overall title last
year, yet she had disastrous results at the 2001 World
Championships--she says now she didn't want to win a medal--and then
underwent three operations on her left knee.</TE>
<TE>   There were rumors that Kostelic was going to hang up her skis
before her 20th birthday--don't ski racers of the world wish.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic is truly a Zagreb-to-riches story. Lacking funds to
attend private ski academies, Janica and Ivica were driven town to
town by their father, Ante. Sometimes, the family would sleep in the
car, or in tents.</TE>
<TE>   Janica has tended to roll her eyes when asked to recount the
hardships of youth at post-race news conferences.</TE>
<TE>   Her stock answer is that it wasn't so hard, and she compared the
overnight adventures to "camping."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic did say Friday that, with determination and a fast line
down the hill, all things are possible.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't really matter where you come from," she said. "You can
be from Fiji or Cameroon. If you train hard and like what you're
doing, you can have success, for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic also said that success comes with a price, and that
winning four medals made her very, very tired.</TE>
<TE>   "I really need a good massage," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And a trophy case.</TE>

<HD>Dutchman Flies to Record</HD>
<DH>Uytdehaage breaks the 13-minute mark in the 10,000 meters
for his second gold medal. Parra of U.S. settles for 13th.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>The Derek and Jochem show became a solo act Friday.</LD>
<LD>   In their two previous speedskating races, Derek Parra of San
Bernardino and Jochem Uytdehaage of the Netherlands took turns
winning in world-record time, Uytdehaage the 5,000-meter event, Parra
the 1,500. Each finished second in the race he didn't win.</LD>
<LD>   Friday, they were paired in the 10,000, the longest Olympic race,
25 laps around the 400-meter track--but not for long.</LD>
<TE>   Skating a world-record time of 12 minutes 58.92 seconds--and
becoming the first to break the 13-minute mark--Uytdehaage finished
nearly a lap ahead of Parra.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he'd be the one to beat," an exhausted Parra said later.
"I was hoping I could hang on with him, have him pull me to a medal.
But I just didn't have it today and he did....When he went, I
couldn't go with him."</TE>
<TE>   So Parra, with his 13:33.44, settled for 13th in the 16-skater
field, the other medals going to Gianni Romme of the Netherlands and
Lasse Saetre of Norway. Romme, the defending Olympic champion and
world-record holder before the race, finished second in 13:10.03,
Saetre third in 13:16.92.</TE>
<TE>   "This was an almost perfect race," Uytdehaage said. "In that
near-13 minutes, there were so many thoughts in my head, 'Stay alert,
stay in the right rhythm, keep your breath under control.' ... It
felt like dancing on the straights."</TE>
<TE>   It felt like torture to Parra.</TE>
<TE>   "I fell apart pretty bad," he said. "I had a couple of days after
the 1,500 when I was exhausted from doing TV shows and TV shows, but
that goes with the territory. I wasn't technically sound, not too
efficient in the first part, then I started fatiguing.... About
midway through, I got hot. I really overheated and couldn't
concentrate anymore."</TE>
<TE>   So why, with gold and silver already to his credit, did Parra
choose to skate the most grueling race of the Games, a race he had
skated only twice previously this season?</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, it's the Olympics," he said. "I've trained for I don't know
how many years to race in the Olympics, and regardless if I get 20th,
last, first or whatever, I just want to be in the race, be an
Olympian. Competing is the most important thing....The 10K really
isn't my specialty. I wanted to finish on a good note [and] I skated
my personal best [in the event]--I can't complain."</TE>
<TE>   As an indication of how far speedskating has advanced in recent
years, what with hinge-bladed clapskates and indoor rinks, Parra's
13th-place time was nearly a minute faster than the world-record
14:28.13 Eric Heiden skated in winning the gold at Lake Placid in
1980.</TE>
<TE>   At nearly 32, Parra isn't figuring on another Olympics, but he
might not be done with skating. He has been thinking about
professional marathon skating in Holland.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been approached by anybody but, yeah, if they come up
and talk to me and we can work it out," he said. "And my wife
[Tiffany] says it's OK. I have to ask her, you know. She's the boss."</TE>
<TE>   Marathon races typically are 30- or 40-kilometer events, much
longer than the Olympic 10,000.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's pack-style," Parra said. "You don't have inner and outer
lanes. It's easier in pack-style. I raced inlines [roller
skates]--we'd skate 100K in a pack. It's completely different. You
can jump in back of a group if you're tired, recover, then go back to
the front. I've won 100Ks, ultra-marathons, 50Ks on inline skates."</TE>
<TE>   And two Olympic medals, a gold and a silver, on speedskates.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Erstad Has Short Memory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>This could be the last time Darin Erstad reports to spring training
with the Angels, but he isn't concerned.</LD>
<LD>   He isn't concerned about whether he will finish this season with
the Angels, or start next season with them. He isn't concerned about
his health. And he certainly isn't concerned about his miserable 2001
season.</LD>
<LD>   "It was like it never happened," Erstad said.</LD>
<TE>   As soon as the final out had been recorded last October, Erstad
erased the lost season from his memory. He sets the tone for
clubhouse intensity, so he refused to yield to nagging back and knee
injuries. He looked lost against left-handed pitchers and
occasionally looked hopelessly lost on routine fly balls. And, while
enduring a divorce, he sometimes lost his relentless focus on the
game.</TE>
<TE>   So, he figures, this season is bound to be better. "It can't get
any worse," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, he batted .355, became the first leadoff hitter in major
league history to drive in 100 runs and had 240 hits, a total last
exceeded in 1930. He plummeted to .258 last season, with his home
runs down and his strikeouts up. His average against left-handers
crashed from .338 to .204.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon plans to use a wretched 2001 season as motivation for
this one, but Erstad has no use whatsoever for last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need any extra motivation," Erstad said. "It's great to
be back and have another go at it."</TE>
<TE>   He almost did not get that chance, at least with the Angels. In
December, the Chicago White Sox agreed to trade outfielder Chris
Singleton, promising young pitcher Jon Garland and two prospects for
Erstad, but the Angels abandoned the trade. In the process of
negotiating the departure of Angel President Tony Tavares, Disney
executive Paul Pressler directed General Manager Bill Stoneman to try
to win this season, and Stoneman told the White Sox the deal was
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad said discussions on a long-term contract with the Angels
"weren't very serious," so he agreed to a one-year contract and
retained his eligibility for free agency following the season. If the
Angels are not in contention in July, they could trade him and get
players in return rather than risk losing him for two draft picks in
free agency.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking about winning the World Series," he said. "I'm not
sitting here thinking that this is my last spring [here] or that I'm
getting traded or about contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm more concerned with getting back and playing good baseball
instead of worrying about multiyear contracts. If I don't play well,
it's not going to matter. I'll have to pay somebody to let me play."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad said his strong rural roots--he was born and raised in
North Dakota--would not dissuade him from signing a contract to stay
with the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm playing big league baseball, I couldn't care less where
I'm playing," he said. "Am I going to live in California when I'm
done playing? No.... But I love playing baseball in Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said he has not decided whether Erstad or
David Eckstein will bat leadoff. If Eckstein leads off, Erstad would
bat second. If Erstad leads off, Eckstein would bat second or ninth,
with Adam Kennedy or Scott Spiezio second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels will celebrate the 20th anniversary of their 1982
division championship team throughout the course of this season.</TE>
<TE>   Included in the plans are giveaways of bobblehead-doll replicas of
Bobby Grich (April 27), Rod Carew (July 6) and Brian Downing (Aug.
31).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels signed minor league pitchers Brendan Donnelly, John
Lackey and Mark Lukasiewicz to one-year contracts.</TE>

<HD>Extra Innings</HD>
<DH>Appier, Sele Join a Rotation That Can Pitch Angels Deep
Into Games, Maybe Into Playoffs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>If it's the fifth inning and no one is warming up in the bullpen,
that's a good sign. If it's the sixth inning and no one is warming
up, that's a better sign. If it's the seventh inning and no one is
warming up, the Angels just might be creeping toward playing in
October.</LD>
<LD>   For all the happy talk about veteran leadership imported to help
nurture an otherwise young starting rotation, the truth is this:
Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele aren't here to be big brothers to Jarrod
Washburn, Ramon Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis.</LD>
<LD>   Appier and Sele are here to pitch 200 innings apiece, and to win.
The expectations are identical for Washburn, Ortiz and Schoeneweis.</LD>
<TE>   The three major league teams that got more than 1,000 innings from
their starting pitchers last season--the Oakland Athletics, Atlanta
Braves and World Series champion Arizona Diamondbacks--all advanced
to the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels aren't going to slug their way into the playoffs this
season. But if the starters can reliably pitch six or seven innings
and the bullpen can stay fresh, one clutch hit--rather than two or
three home runs--might be enough to deliver a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always nice when you have starting pitching you know will go
deep into the game," Angel reliever Al Levine said. "That's when you
know you have a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland starters led the majors by pitching 1,022 innings. The
five Angel starters, including Appier's work for the New York Mets
and Sele's for the Seattle Mariners, combined to pitch 1,029 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a chance to win every day," Angel closer Troy Percival
said.</TE>
<TE>   If Appier is cruising, Levine or Lou Pote won't have to warm up in
the fifth inning, then the sixth, then again before entering the game
in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   If Sele is cruising, the Angels can save Dennis Cook--probably
their only left-handed reliever--for left-handed hitters such as
Rafael Palmeiro or John Olerud in a pivotal at-bat late in a game.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it easier on the bullpen," Percival said. "I don't see
us getting gassed in September."</TE>
<TE>   Said pitching coach Bud Black: "It's a huge lift. It might take 10
innings off Levine, 10 innings off Pote, and 10 innings off Cook."
Pote pitched 87 innings last season, Levine 76 and Cook 46.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't a foolproof plan. Angel starters last season pitched
exactly 1,000 innings, but a wretched offense ruined any hope of
contending for the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, assuming the offense can only get better, it does not have
to get that much better. The Braves rode their pitchers into the
playoffs, scoring more runs than the Angels but fewer than all but
three of their National League rivals.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angel staff should be better this season. While the club
also had veterans in the rotation last season, check the numbers: Pat
Rapp and Ismael Valdes pitched 334 innings and won 14 games; Appier
and Sele pitched 422 innings and won 26 games.</TE>
<TE>   In the past five seasons, Sele has pitched at least 200 innings
four times, Appier three and Valdes once. Rapp never did.</TE>
<TE>   Check the money too: The Angels paid Rapp and Valdes a total of
$4.5 million in base salary last season. They will pay Appier and
Sele $16.5 million this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Ismael and Rapp were veteran guys, but not with the kind of
resume as these guys have," Schoeneweis said.</TE>
<TE>   These veteran guys are more than happy to return the compliment.
Sele shrugs off talk of him and Appier leading the young pups,
pointing out that Washburn, Ortiz and Schoeneweis are entering their
fourth season together in the Angel rotation. The trio combined to
throw 607 innings last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Before they had Kevin and I, they had three solid guys," Sele
said. "Everybody says, all these young kids. They've done it. They
know what they're doing, and they're good at it. It's not like
they're coming out of double A and they don't know what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Strong starting pitching isn't the only way into the playoffs, of
course. No American League team got fewer innings from its starters
last season than the Cleveland Indians, but General Manager John Hart
built a playoff-bound team behind Juan Gonzalez, Jim Thome, Roberto
Alomar, Ellis Burks and a tireless bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman built his around the five
starters.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels playoff-bound? If it's the seventh inning and all is
quiet in the bullpen, they might be.</TE>

<HD>Griffey Sr. Resigns as Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ken Griffey Sr. abruptly resigned Friday from the Cincinnati Reds
coaching staff but will remain with the team as a consultant.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Bob Boone said he didn't see the resignation coming.</LD>
<LD>   "It caught me completely by surprise," Boone said. "I wasn't aware
of anything."</LD>
<TE>   The Reds gave no reason for Griffey's decision. He will become a
special consultant to Reds' General Manager Jim Bowden, switching
jobs with Jose Cardenal, who replaces Griffey as first-base coach.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey, 51, was not immediately available for comment. Outfielder
Ken Griffey Jr. was surprised to learn that his father had quit.</TE>
<TE>   "I only talked to him for a minute and said that I'd call him
back," Griffey Jr. said.</TE>
<TE>   Griffey Sr. played for 19 seasons and was the right fielder on
Cincinnati's "Big Red Machine" championship teams in 1975 and 1976.
He was entering his sixth season as a Reds' coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a player move, the Reds agreed with first baseman Sean Casey on
a $20.2 million, three-year contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, I'm just one piece of the puzzle, and we can go out
and get some other pieces to make this a championship-caliber
ballclub," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement binds Casey to the club through the 2005 season,
with the Reds retaining an $8.5 million option for 2006. The deal
calls for him to be paid $5.6 million in 2003, $6.8 million in 2004
and $7.8 million in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Casey, 27, said at a news conference that he wanted to stay in
Cincinnati, where he has twice made the All-Star team and has led the
Reds in numerous offensive categories.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Casey batted a team-leading .310 with 13 homers and
89 runs batted in. He also led the Reds in runs (69) and hits (165).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego Padre shortstop Deivi Cruz is the latest major league
player discovered to be older than his listed age.</TE>
<TE>   The commissioner's office informed team officials that Cruz is 29,
three years older than his biography lists.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancy was discovered when Cruz applied for a visa to
travel from the Dominican Republic to spring training. With tighter
security guidelines, officials are requiring an original birth
certificate, rather than just a copy.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland Athletic relief pitcher Luis Vizcaino also was found to be
26 instead of 24.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the true ages of several players have been
revealed, including Kansas City's Neifi Perez, Cleveland's Bartolo
Colon, Atlanta's Rafael Furcal and the Angels' Ramon Ortiz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco first baseman J.T. Snow sprained his left ankle
while doing fielding drills at the Giants' training facility in
Scottsdale, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   "He's walking pretty normally right now," said Giant trainer Stan
Conte, who called the sprain a mild one.</TE>
<TE>   X-rays taken at a hospital appeared to be negative and were to be
reviewed by a team doctor later Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "At this time," said Conte, "the sprain doesn't appear to be bad,
and he should be able to return to workouts in several days."</TE>
<TE>   Snow is coming off a disappointing season that included three
stints on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Expos agreed to minor league contracts with
outfielder Lance Johnson and right-hander Osvaldo Fernandez.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 38, who spent last season in the minors, has a .291
average in 14 seasons, primarily with the Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez, 33, went 5-6 with a 6.92 earned-run average for
Cincinnati last year. He is 19-26 in 67 career starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Puckett, the wife of former Minnesota Twin and Hall of Famer
Kirby Puckett, has filed for a divorce two months after she told
police her husband threatened to kill her during an argument.</TE>
<TE>   Tonya Puckett, 36, seeks sole custody of their 9-year-old son and
11-year-old daughter. She cited "an irretrievable breakdown" in their
marriage.</TE>
<TE>   She filed a report with police Dec. 21 alleging that Kirby
Puckett, during a Dec. 15 phone conversation with her, threatened
that he "was going to kill her."</TE>
<TE>   Kirby Puckett told police he had not made such a threat.</TE>

<LD>   Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (14-9, 8-7) at Long Beach State (11-16,
7-9), 5--Long Beach continued its late-season run with a 77-74
victory against UC Santa Barbara on Thursday. Freshman Cody Pearson
had nine rebounds for the 49ers. Cal Poly will try to bounce back
from a 77-63 loss to UC Irvine, a game in which the Mustangs shot
only 27% in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   UC Santa Barbara (15-9, 9-6) at UC Irvine (19-8, 12-4), 7, Channel
56, KUCI-FM (88.9)--The Anteaters can solidify the No. 2 spot in the
Big West Conference tournament with a victory but, more importantly,
a win will leave them within striking range of first-place Utah
State, which plays host to Idaho. It will be the final home game for
senior All-American candidate Jerry Green, along with J.R. Christ and
Dave Korfman. Forward Jordan Harris is averaging 16.5 points and 7.8
rebounds the last four games. Santa Barbara lost its cool in a
damaging 77-74 loss at Long Beach State as it tries to secure third
place.</LD>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge (9-15, 8-7) at Cal State Fullerton (4-20,
1-14), 7, KCSN-FM (88.5)--Northridge got big games from freshman
forward Ian Boylan and senior point guard Markus Carr and ended a
five-game losing streak with a 73-64 Big West victory against UC
Riverside on Thursday. The Matadors hope the momentum carries over
against a Fullerton team that has lost eight consecutive games.
Forward Pape Sow had 18 points and 10 rebounds in a 67-61 loss to
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific (16-9, 8-7) at UC Riverside (8-15, 5-10), 7, KUCR-FM
(88.3), KPRO (1570)--Pacific is coming off a 67-61 victory against
Fullerton and has lately looked like a team capable of reaching next
month's Big West tournament championship game for the second year in
a row. Riverside was defeated by Northridge, 73-64.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanford showed Friday night it is more than ready for the Pacific 10
Conference tournament.</LD>
<LD>   The second-ranked Cardinal trailed USC, 36-28, at halftime, then
dismantled the Trojans in the second half for a 78-60 victory before
1,779 at the Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Nicole Powell, the probable conference player of the year, had 36
points and eight rebounds to lift Stanford (27-1 overall, 17-0 in the
Pac-10) to its 19th consecutive victory. Lindsey Hunter added 20,
with 15 points coming in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   Ebony Hoffman had 14 points and eight rebounds for USC (14-12,
10-7).</TE>
<TE>   USC used a 19-4 run in the final 6:09 to take a 36-28 halftime
lead, but Stanford scored the first 14 points of the second half for
a 42-36 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman ended the Trojan drought at 14:48 with a three-point
basket. By the 10-minute mark, however, the Cardinal run had
mushroomed to 28-6, and its lead was 56-42.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who made only seven of 39 shots in the second half
(18%), would get no closer than 14 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected them to get back into the game," USC Coach Chris
Gobrecht said.</TE>
<TE>   "What I take issue with is how long it took us to recover. It was
still a four-point game with 15 minutes left and we're still
grieving."</TE>
<TE>   The conference tournament begins Friday at Oregon.</TE>

<TE>   Whitney Jones and Shalada Allen added 12 points each for UCLA
(8-18, 4-13).</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins led, 32-25, at halftime and extended their lead to
49-36 with 4:05 remaining. Cal closed within 49-40, but Natalie
Nakase and Malika Leatham made key free throws down the stretch to
help secure the victory.</TE>
<TE>   LaTasha O'Keith scored nine points to lead California (7-19,

<LD>Villa Park High had a good start in its Southern Section Division
II-AA quarterfinal Friday night, but Inglewood had an even better
finish, scoring 17 of the final 19 points in a 63-46 victory at
Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think we played with a lot of composure the last five
minutes," Villa Park Coach Kevin Reynolds said. "We broke down a
couple of times offensively and turned it over. We didn't execute."</LD>
<LD>   The Sentinels led, 46-44, when Chris Holloway's basket with 4
minutes 50 seconds remaining began their decisive run. Ray Reed
followed with a three-point basket 30 seconds later, his fourth of
the game.</LD>
<TE>   Brice Prather scored what proved to be Villa Park's final points
with 2:46 remaining, cutting the deficit to 51-46. D'Angelo Collins
and Holloway ended the Spartans' hopes of a comeback by combining to
score the next 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We started off with a pretty rotten start," Inglewood Coach Pat
Roy said. "Our point guard Jason McKinney didn't really get a good
feel of the basketball tonight. He had some key turnovers in the
first quarter and he had some key turnovers in the fourth, but he
came up with a big defensive stop as well."</TE>
<TE>   Collins, a 6-foot-10 senior center likely to make himself eligible
for the NBA draft, finished with 21 points. Reed added 20, 16 in the
second half, and Holloway 15 for the Sentinels (24-5).</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-9 Sean Phaler, considered to be one of the nation's top
juniors, had 11 of his 17 points in the first half as Villa Park
(26-4) led, 22-21. Prather added 14 and Kyle Hogan 12, 10 in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter, Inglewood's Reed made two three-point
baskets and Collins and Ron Ligon one each helping the Sentinels to a
43-40 lead. Reed opened the fourth quarter with another three-point
basket.</TE>
<TE>   Inglewood will play Pasadena, a 67-54 winner over Claremont in a
semifinal Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Herbert</TE>

<TE>   Compton Centennial 50, Pasadena Muir 43--Showing why he is one of
the top guards in Southern California, Gabriel Pruitt scored 20
points to help the Apaches (28-0) rally from a five-point deficit in
the fourth quarter to win a Division III-A semifinal at La Canada
High.</TE>
<TE>   The game's decisive moment came with 6:07 left when Centennial's
Darius Sanders scored and drew the fifth foul on Muir's leading
scorer Ryan Hollins. Hollins then picked up a technical and Pruitt
made both free throw giving the Apaches a 36-35 lead.</TE>
<TE>   After Muir tied the score at 38-38 on a three-point shot by Owen
Duckworth , Centennial retaliated with consecutive three-point
baskets by Sterling Byrd and Jonathan Smith to take a 43-38 lead with
2:11 remaining. Muir (23-6) received a team high 10 points from
Jamaal Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Centennial will play second-seeded Torrance Bishop Montgomery, a
79-34 winner over Ridgecrest Burroughs, Saturday at the Pond of
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley 78, Fontana A.B. Miller 63--Matt
Sweany scored a season-high 35 points, Pete DeCasas added 20 and Jake
Franzen chipped in with 12 as the three senior starters accounted for
all but 11 points for the Cougars (24-6), who advance to a Tuesday
Division I-AA semifinal against the Fontana-Long Beach Poly winner.</TE>
<TE>   The trio played an integral part on last season's team that lost
in the CIF finals to Upland. While their regular season performances
were impressive, they have stepped up their efforts in the playoffs,
according to their coach, Brian Mulligan.</TE>
<TE>   "These three seniors just do not want to lose," he said. "And
that's what you need this far in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Valley scored the game's first six points but then fell
behind and trailed 17-11 after one quarter. DeCasas scored nine in
the second quarter and Sweany had eight to help the Cougars tie the
game, 32-32, at intermission.</TE>
<TE>   Sweany, who also had 10 rebounds, scored 16 third quarter points,
hitting two three pointers in the first minute during a 9-0
Capistrano Valley run. Two more three pointers in the final two
minutes helped the Cougars increase their lead to 56-44.</TE>
<TE>   Third-seeded A.B. Miller (23-7) climbed to within 56-51, but
Capistrano Valley reclaimed the momentum with a 14-4 run.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremiah Ward scored a team-high 21 points and Victor Michel added
14. Jacob Ramirez, who this season had a 55-point game and had two
games in which he scored more than 40, managed just 13.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Dermody</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Division III-AA semifinals:</TE>
<TE>   La Puente Bishop Amat 57, Artesia 54--Paul Porter picked a pass by
Artesia and drove for a layup to give Bishop Amat a 53-50 lead with
less than a minute to play. From there, Porter hit three free throws
to secure the win at Mayfair High. Porter had 15 points in the game
to lead Bishop Amat, which will play Palm Desert next Saturday at the
Pond of Anaheim the Division III championship. Artesia finishes the
season at 20-7.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Verbum Dei 71, Montclair Prep 53--Tai Turner scored 20 points
and Richard Chaney added 14 points, 10 rebounds and seven rebounds
for top-seeded Verbum Dei (26-3) in a Division IV-A semifinal. Nick
Stigger scored 31 points for fourth-seeded Montclair Prep (16-12).</TE>
<TE>   Gardena Serra 91, Calvary Chapel Downey 68--Eugene Jeter scored 28
points and Chris Hemphill added 26 to lead Serra (26-3) over Calvary
Chapel Downey (24-5), setting up a Friday against Verbum Dei at
Loyola Marymount.</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana Stoneridge Prep 72, Palm Springs Desert Chapel 57--James
Spencer scored 27 points, including 23 in the first half to lead
Stoneridge Prep (23-5) over Palm Springs Desert Chapel (20-4), in a
Division V-A semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Glendora 79, Lancaster 75 (OT)--Larry Monroe scored six of his 21
points in overtime to lead Glendora (27-2) to a Division I-A
quarterfinal victory over Lancaster (21-8). Mike Webb led Lancaster
with 33 points.</TE>
<TE>   Bellflower St. John Bosco 80, Corona Centennial 75--Gio St. Amant
had 28 points and 15 rebounds and Robert Reynaga had 21 points, seven
assists and four steals for host St. John Bosco (24-6), as they upset
fourth-seeded Centennial (24-4) and earned a berth in theDivisoin
II-AA semifinals on Tuesday against the Mater Dei/Woodbridge winner.

<HD>Redondo Makes Shots It Needed</HD>
<DH>Boys' basketball: Despite off shooting night by White, Sea
Hawks able to defeat Santa Margarita, 56-53, in Division II-A
semifinal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Redondo Union swingman Wendell White doesn't have the option of
shooting three-point baskets whenever he wants. It only seems that
way.</LD>
<LD>   White missed his first seven three-point attempts Friday night
against Santa Margarita, but made the one the third-seeded Sea Hawks
needed to topple the second-seeded Eagles, 56-53, in a Southern
Section Division II-A boys' basketball semifinal at Concordia
University in Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't think I was going to make one," said White, whose only
three-pointer of the game gave Redondo a 54-51 lead with just over
two minutes to play.</LD>
<TE>   Brandon Rohe made a driving basket to pull the Eagles (23-5) to
within a point, and Santa Margarita looked as if it would get a
chance to win with a final shot after White missed another
three-point attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Rohe, who finished with 22 points, drove into the lane and pulled
up for a shot, which bounced off the rim. White, who grabbed the
rebound and was fouled with six seconds, made the first free throw
and missed the second, but pulled down the rebound. He drew another
foul with 0.8 seconds left and again made one of two shots to give
Redondo a three-point cushion.</TE>
<TE>   Sea Hawk guard Eddie Topps, a defensive back on the football team,
intercepted Santa Margarita's inbounds pass.</TE>
<TE>   Redondo (22-6) will try to win its second consecutive section
title when it faces top-seeded Riverside King (27-3) on March 2 at
the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   The Sea Hawks advanced thanks in part to Keith Ellison, who scored
17 of his game-high 28 points in the game's first 10 minutes. Redondo
took a 17-point lead early in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Determined not to collapse, Santa Margarita steadily chipped away
at the deficit until it took its first lead since the opening
possession on Rohe's two free throws with 3:12 to play. The Eagles
then tied the score, 51-51, on Rohe's turnaround jumper about a
minute later.</TE>
<TE>   "We were in position to win," Santa Margarita Coach Jerry DeBusk
said. "We couldn't make the basket or the free throw that would give
us a cushion."</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles have lost three consecutive semifinal games to Bay
League teams; Inglewood ended Santa Margarita's season the last two
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The way White was shooting for much of the game, though, it looked
as if the Eagles might be bound for the Pond. White finished with 11
points after making only four of 17 shots from the field, including
one of 10 from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't thinking, to be honest," White said. "I should have
driven to the basket."</TE>

<HD>For Kuntz, Baseball Like Watching Grass Grow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If that fellow mowing the grass and trimming the palm trees at the
Florida Marlins' training facility in Melbourne, Fla., seems
familiar, he should. He's a World Series winner and, until a week or
so ago, he was one of the team's coaches.</LD>
<LD>   Rusty Kuntz, whose seventh-inning sacrifice fly provided the
game-winning RBI in the final game of the 1984 World Series for the
Detroit Tigers, was one of the 60 employees fired by the Marlins last
week when new ownership took over.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a way to get out of the house," Kuntz said of the gardening
chores he has been doing voluntarily each off-season since 1993. "I'm
not a hobby guy or a golfer or a fisherman. I just prune trees, and I
like being outside watching grass grow."</LD>
<TE>   Now, at least until he lands another baseball job, he's doing it
full time.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time in 26 years I haven't been to a spring
training camp," Kuntz said. "That's the hard part about it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Of the NBA's all-time top 10 rebound leaders, only
one is still active. Who is he?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Round 1: In giving a generally thumbs-down review to the movie
"Ali," which recently opened in England, Kevin Mitchell of the
Observer said reality movies about boxing usually fail.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an unreal sport, leaning heavily toward pastiche," he said.
"You only have to watch the antics of Mike Tyson to understand why
boxing is rarely more than a press conference away from farce."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Round 2: Mitchell listed his top 10 boxing movies of all time,
including in the list "Somebody Up There Likes Me," which, he said,
"handed Paul Newman one of the great lines.</TE>
<TE>   "When asked if he wanted a protective cup, he replied: 'I'll drink
from the bottle like the rest of the boys.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stat so? The first home run that Todd Zeile hits for his new club,
the Colorado Rockies, will give him at least one homer for nine
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1900, only two other players, Tommy Davis and Dave Martinez,
have matched that, according to the Society For American Baseball
Research, which keeps track of this sort of thing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Signature tune: Pedro Martinez has three Cy Young awards sitting
on his shelf at home, but he has something else just as prized: a
football signed by the New England Patriots before the NFL season
they ended with an upset victory over the St. Louis Rams in the Super
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I was rooting for them," Martinez told Baseball Weekly, "because
that's the only team I've got a signed ball from."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1985, Indiana basketball Coach Bob
Knight was ejected five minutes into a game against Purdue for
throwing a chair across the court.</TE>
<TE>   After the Hoosiers were assessed two fouls, Knight got a
technical. Then while Purdue was shooting the free throw, Knight
picked up a chair from the bench area and threw it across the court,
earning his second technical. Indiana lost the game, 72-63.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Karl Malone, who still needs more than 10,000 more
to catch Wilt Chamberlain.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Bill Scheft in ESPN the Magazine: "In other
football news, Bill Parcells' wife of 40 years filed for divorce. Sad
story. She walked in on somebody tampering with him."</TE>

<HD>Cincinnati Turns Back Marquette</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six-foot-11 center Donald Little claims he's a good outside shooter.
He was able to prove it under pressure.</LD>
<LD>   Little made a wide-open 15-foot jump shot with three seconds left
Friday night as No. 4 Cincinnati overcame a pair of blown leads and
rallied for a 63-62 victory over No. 9 Marquette at Cincinnati.</LD>
<LD>   Conference USA's top two teams played a game befitting the
stakes--back and forth until it was decided in the closing seconds by
Dwyane Wade's missed free throw and Little's improbable jumper.</LD>
<TE>   "A conference championship was on the line," said Little, who made
all five of his shots and had 12 points. "You don't want to be the
first [Cincinnati] team not to win one."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati (26-2, 13-1) ended a losing streak at three against
Marquette (23-4, 12-2) and has the conference's best record with two
games left. The Bearcats have won each of Conference USA's six
regular-season titles.</TE>
<TE>   Marquette (23-4, 12-2) overcame deficits of 16 and 12 points, and
led, 62-58, with 30 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   But, Steve Logan made a three-point shot with 22 seconds left that
made it 62-61, and Wade--a 70.7% free-throw shooter--went to the line
for a one-and-one with 20 seconds left. He missed his first try,
setting the stage for Little's game-deciding shot.</TE>
<TE>   Cordell Henry's heave from just inside half-court bounced off the
back of the rim as the buzzer sounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It just went their way," Marquette Coach Tom Crean said. "It
turned out to be the kind of game that people were expecting to see."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AROUND THE NATION</TE>
<TE>   Ed Persia scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half and
Princeton remained in the thick of the Ivy League race with a 59-46
victory over Yale at Princeton, N.J. Princeton (13-9, 8-2) ended a
winning streak at seven by Yale (17-8, 9-2) and moved within a half
game of the Ivy League leader. Yale, which was trying to sweep
Princeton in a season series for the first time since 1986, shot only
34.7% and had 15 turnovers as it was held to a season low in points.
The Tigers held Ime Archibong, Paul Vitelli and Edwin Draughan, who
average a combined 33.7 points, to 16.... Kentucky sophomores Gerald
Fitch and Erik Daniels were suspended indefinitely after they were
charged with using fake driver's licenses to try to get into a
nightclub.... Brian Jackson returned to Oregon State, only two days
after he had decided to leave the team.</TE>

<HD>Maggette Goes on Injured List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>As expected, the Clippers put Corey Maggette on the injured list
Friday because of what team doctor Tony Daly said are dislocated
fourth and fifth metacarpals in the right hand.</LD>
<LD>   It's uncertain how long Maggette, who also has a mild concussion
and a sore left knee, is expected to be sidelined. It could be about
a month before he is fit to play again and the Clippers are said to
be seeking free-agent help for the short term.</LD>
<LD>   Maggette had a hard cast placed on his hand, which he injured
during the Clippers' loss Thursday against the Orlando Magic. The
injury was at first called a dislocated knuckle of his right pinkie.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Alvin Gentry could play Darius Miles in Maggette's starting
spot at small forward tonight against the Indiana Pacers. Maggette
had been filling in for Lamar Odom, who will be sidelined for several
more weeks because of sprains to his right wrist and ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Miles had muscle spasms in his right side Thursday, a condition
related to the sprained right shoulder he suffered Monday, and he
could not play in the fourth quarter against the Magic. He was termed
questionable to play tonight by the team.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are 2-3 since the All-Star break and scrambling to
move among the top eight teams that will qualify for the Western
Conference playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette has been their defensive stopper, guarding the
opposition's best offensive forward. Thursday, he was matched up
against Tracy McGrady of the Magic and he has also guarded Kobe
Bryant of the Lakers.</TE>

<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Indiana, 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Site--Conseco Fieldhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 27-29, Pacers 26-28.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Pacers--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Ron Artest, Ron Mercer, Brad Miller and Kevin Ollie made
their debuts as Pacers on Friday against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
They were acquired Tuesday from the Chicago Bulls for Travis Best,
Norm Richardson, Jalen Rose and a draft pick. The move means the
Pacers will count on rookie Jamaal Tinsley, who has averaged more
than eight assists, to be the starting point guard. The Clippers beat
the Pacers, 103-72, Dec. 2 at Staples Center but they have lost eight
consecutive at Indianapolis, their last victory coming Jan. 8, 1992.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Orosco Is Getting to Be an Old Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Few baseball players can make 39-year-old Terry Mulholland feel
young, but if the Dodger pitcher feels the effects of advancing age,
all he needs to do is look a few locker stalls down at teammate Jesse
Orosco, the reliever who will turn 45 on April 21.</LD>
<LD>   "He'll be able to collect a pension and still draw a salary,"
Mulholland said. "What's up with that?"</LD>
<LD>   Many think Orosco wants to pitch until he's 50. The left-hander
says that's not true, but don't be shocked if he does. Orosco, who
made his major league debut for the New York Mets in 1979, has 22
seasons and two World Series championships (1986 Mets, 1988 Dodgers)
on his resume, and he has an excellent chance of winning a Dodger
bullpen spot this spring.</LD>
<TE>   "My age is just a number," Orosco said. "It seems like I'm ancient
because of my age and service time, but I don't feel like it. I still
have that fire to compete."</TE>
<TE>   This spring, he has the health to go with it. Orosco was
recovering from elbow surgery in 2001 and failed to make the team
when it broke camp. The Dodgers released him and then re-signed him
to a minor league contract on April 24. After 10 games at triple-A
Las Vegas, Orosco was recalled and went 0-1 with a 3.94 earned-run
average in 35 games as the Dodgers' primary left-handed relief
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious his arm is stronger than it was at this time last
year," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "He wasn't there yet
[physically] in spring training, but he pitched very effectively for
us down the stretch. We're going to try to stretch him out here so he
can pitch to right-handers as well as lefties."</TE>
<TE>   Orosco attributes his longevity to consistent mechanics and work
habits. Known best for recording the final out of the Mets' World
Series-clinching Game 7 victory over Boston in 1986 and then hurling
his glove in the air, Orosco is one of those rare athletes who can
appear on ESPN Classic and ESPN on the same night.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a fine wine," Dodger reliever Paul Quantrill said. "He
gets better with age."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers are contemplating a bid for South Korean reliever Jin
Pil-Jung, a 29-year-old right-hander who was posted by the Doosan
Bears on Thursday. The Angels, Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers
are also interested in Jung, who has a 64-47 career record and 2.92
ERA in seven Korean seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The 30 major league teams have until 2 p.m. (PST) Tuesday to
submit offers to the commissioner's office. The amount of the highest
bid will be forwarded to the Korean Series-champion Bears, who will
decide to accept or reject it.</TE>
<TE>   If accepted, the team with the winning bid will have 30 days to
negotiate a contract with Jung, a projected set-up man who has a
91-mph fastball and a slider but does not possess the kind of
dominant out pitch that could elevate him to a closer role in the
U.S. Jung went 9-6 with a 3.22 ERA and 23 saves last season.</TE>
<TE>   Two Japanese players, Seattle outfielder Ichiro Suzuki and Dodger
pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii, have gone through the posting process since
it was put in place in 2000, but Jung is not expected to command
nearly as high a bid as Suzuki ($13.1 million) or Ishii ($11.26
million).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ishii attracted a huge audience for his first serious bullpen
workout in Dodgertown on Friday, but the crowd consisted of more than
Japanese reporters and photographers. By the end of Ishii's 67-pitch
session, a large contingent of Dodgers, including Kevin Brown, Darren
Dreifort and Hideo Nomo, were checking out the new left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just trying to get through some jet lag and God knows how
many time zones, but his fastball had some pop to it and his breaking
ball was sharp," said Chad Kreuter, who caught Ishii on Friday. "He
reminds me of [former Angel pitcher] Mark Langston because of his arm
slot and the rotation of the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii threw fastballs, curves and split-fingered fastballs, but
did not throw a slider, his best pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's his best pitch," Kreuter said, "I'm looking forward to
seeing it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby, recovering from surgery to repair a torn
flexor muscle in his pitching elbow, felt no ill effects from his
bullpen workout Thursday, but Tracy said he is pushing back Ashby's
first live batting practice session to Sunday "because I want to err
on the side of caution."</TE>

<HD>Rucchin Back for Final 21</HD>

<LD>Time is growing short for Mighty Duck center Steve Rucchin and he
realizes that. He has only a few days to prepare before returning to
the lineup.</LD>
<LD>   He has only 21 games left to prove he can return to the form that
made him the team's No. 1 center.</LD>
<LD>   Rucchin, who said he will play against Minnesota on Wednesday, has
missed 44 games after suffering a stress fracture in his ankle Nov.
11, which later needed surgery. Over the last two seasons, he has
played in only 33 of the Ducks' last 143 games because of injuries.</LD>
<TE>   He is also in the last year of his contract. So there is a lot to
be gained in 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Most importantly, I need to do what I can to fit in and try to
help this team in any way they want me to," Rucchin said. "Basically,
I'm playing for the guys in the locker room, and for myself, to do
what I can to get back to where I'm comfortable in whatever role that
might be on the team."</TE>
<TE>   The way Rucchin has played in the past has been a comfort to the
Ducks. He averaged 19 goals and 57 points in his first five full
seasons with the Ducks, before injuries forced him to miss 66 of 82
games last season.</TE>
<TE>   He had four goals and 11 points in 17 games this season before
being injured blocking a shot against Dallas.</TE>

<HD>Garcia Loses His Grip, Is Ousted</HD>
<DH>Golf: McCarron defeats him, 1-up, thanks to superior
putting to advance to quarterfinals of match-play event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARLSBAD</DL>
<LD>When he made a hole in one Wednesday, Scott McCarron's bar tab was
$459. How many of his buddies accounted for the bill?</LD>
<LD>   "Uh, two?" McCarron said.</LD>
<LD>   Let the record show that McCarron's posse is larger than that, and
come to think of it, so is his still-growing payday at the
$5.5-million Accenture Match Play Championship. So far, just by
reaching today's quarterfinals against Tom Lehman at La Costa,
McCarron has already bagged $342,000. And to think the tournament is
four days old.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, it didn't even last that long for a bunch of people,
including Sergio Garcia, who thought he should have beaten McCarron
but didn't, mainly because he didn't make enough putts.</TE>
<TE>   "[McCarron] was fortunate to get the right bounces on the greens,"
said Garcia, who lost, 1-up, Friday.</TE>
<TE>   It's not often that you hear players talking about hoping for the
right bounces on the greens, but that's sort of been the story around
here. Nearly every putt has been an adventure in rolling, an
experience caused by the combination of soft greens and the poa annua
grass that covers them.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms, who posted a 1-up victory over Steve Flesch, was asked
the difference between Bermuda greens and poa annua greens. "I make
putts on Bermuda, I don't make putts on poa," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Possibly, but Toms made just enough putts to get by Flesch to
arrange a morning match against Kevin Sutherland, who defeated Jim
Furyk, 4 and 3.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever it took for Toms to win, he still wasn't nearly as
fortunate as Paul Azinger, who somehow defeated Niclas Fasth in 20
holes. Azinger drilled a 40-foot birdie putt at No. 4, birdied four
of the last five holes, including a chip-in at the 17th, watched
Fasth miss an eight-footer that would have ended it at the 18th and
withstood enough pressure to wilt the flowers on his Tommy Bahama
shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I lost," Azinger said.</TE>
<TE>   He thought wrong. Someone else who thought Azinger had lost was
Fasth, who said he had never played better in his life and still
managed to get beat. Said Fasth: "Losing makes it not such a great
week."</TE>
<TE>   Some weeks are like that. Meanwhile, the show goes on, with seven
of the eight remaining golfers Americans. Azinger will play Bob Estes
next after Estes got off to a big early lead over Nick Price and then
held on to win, 1-up. Brad Faxon, who defeated John Cook, 3 and 2,
takes on Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, a 2-up winner over Mark
Calcavecchia. Faxon hasn't had a match extend beyond the 16th hole.
Tom Lehman took advantage when Matt Gogel bogeyed the last three
holes and scored a 4-and-3 victory, which moved him into a showdown
with McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   Lehman called himself a big fan of the match-play setup and isn't
buying any criticism of the format.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I think it's crazy," he said. "I mean, maybe the TV doesn't
like it so much that Tiger is not here, but what the heck? If Pete
Sampras loses in the first round, he doesn't keep on playing until he
makes it to the finals. That's the way sports is ... the top guy can
lose to the bottom guy and that's the beauty of sport."</TE>
<TE>   It will be a busy day at La Costa, where only two players will be
undefeated by sundown. There are four quarterfinal matches in the
morning, then two semifinal matches in the afternoon to set up
Sunday's 36-hole final.</TE>
<TE>   That's the format, including the poa annua greens, which tend to
upset the player because they sometimes grow unevenly, a situation
that worsens during play. At stake is a $1-million paycheck for the
winner.</TE>
<TE>   Still being in the running continues a better-than-average
moneymaking run for McCarron, who earned $276,267 last week when he
was second at the Nissan Open.</TE>
<TE>   In the last nine days, he's made $618,267 and hasn't had to win a
tournament to do it.</TE>
<TE>   But to get this far, to defeat Garcia, McCarron had to tune out
all related distractions, such as watching Garcia grip and regrip his
club. Azinger had called to remind him so, but McCarron already knew
what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't watch one shot," McCarron said. "I watched the tops of
the trees, the clouds, stared at blades of grass, got some water,
read the newspaper."</TE>

<LD>Brandel Chamblee, one of the PGA Tour's top 100 money-winners for
seven consecutive years, shot a five-under-par 67 Friday to take a
two-shot lead in the Tucson Open.</LD>
<LD>   "Just being in the thick of things is exciting," said Chamblee, a
midpoint leader for the first time in three years. "You certainly
enjoy the game either way, but you always like that feeling that
you're about to throw up. It's a welcome feeling."</LD>

numbers left him at 12-under 132.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Pate, who carded a 66, and Bob Tway (67) were 10 under.</TE>

first-round leader Michael Allen, seven shots worse than his opening
64, stayed close at 135.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Pompeyo, erratic before finding his niche in
steeplechase, wins an Eclipse award posthumously.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Add Pompeyo to the list of posthumous Eclipse award winners that
includes, among others, Ruffian, Landaluce, Swale and Go For Wand.</LD>
<LD>   What further distinguishes Pompeyo from most Eclipse winners is
that he was a top runner on the flat in Chile before being introduced
to the steeplechase game. Then in 1998-99 he wound up in trainer Neil
Drysdale's care at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   In the first race for Drysdale, Pompeyo won at 11/4 miles at
Hollywood, but it was all downhill after that. In the 1998 Hollywood
Turf Cup, Pompeyo finished last, beaten by about 15 lengths. In 1999,
Drysdale ran Pompeyo on the dirt, and when he finished last
again--beaten by 261/2 lengths--in the San Bernardino Handicap, it
was time to give up.</LD>
<TE>   Drysdale suggested to Pompeyo's owner, George Strawbridge, that
the horse be given a chance over the jumps. Last Monday night in
Miami Beach, Strawbridge and his stepdaughter, trainer Sanna Neilson,
accepted an Eclipse bronze after the 7-year-old was voted best
steeplechase horse for 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Pompeyo, undefeated in his only two starts last year, was being
prepared for the Breeders' Cup Steeplechase in the fall when he was
kicked by a stablemate as they prepared to go out for a gallop. A
broken elbow required surgery, an infection set in and the horse was
euthanized in mid-January.</TE>
<TE>   "Sanna did a good job with him," Drysdale said. "Sometimes horses
make better jumpers. He was a difficult character when I had him. He
was strong, too strong, and he was pulling all the time. We could
never get him to settle in his races. When he started jumping, he
began to settle nicely."</TE>
<TE>   Pompeyo had come to Drysdale with fancy credentials. He won the
Chilean Derby in 1997 and Strawbridge bought him and brought him to
the U.S. the next year.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was in California, he would jog forever on the training
track, but never do any real training," Strawbridge said. "He was
never fit for his races. But when we started putting him over the
fences, he got focused."</TE>
<TE>   Pompeyo ran 11 steeplechase races, with seven wins, two seconds
and two thirds. On the flat, he had four wins in 22 starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that we don't have him anymore," Neilson said. "If
he could have kept going, I think he could have been the next
Flatterer or Lonesome Glory."</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Flatterer won four straight Eclipses for
steeplechasing and has been voted into the Racing Hall of Fame.
Lonesome Glory was an Eclipse winner five times in the 1990s. Like
Pompeyo, Flatterer came from the flat ranks, where he had trouble
winning even at the claiming level.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the big difference between the two horses," said Bill
Gallo Jr., director of racing for the National Steeplechase Assn.
"Pompeyo was an established stakes winner before he turned to
jumping."</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, another flat runner--a disaster, actually--found a new
life with a different venue. Remember Great Redeemer? A hapless
maiden, he finished so far behind Spectacular Bid in the 1979
Kentucky Derby that he almost ran over a couple of photographers, who
were crossing the track to the winner's circle, thinking all the
horses had passed.</TE>
<TE>   Later that year, in an unexplained incident, Great Redeemer's
owner, J.A. Mohamed, found him bleeding in his stall at Laurel Race
Course, suffering from a four-inch knife wound. Four years later,
Diane and Bob King of North Lima, Ohio, found a home for a
battered-up Great Redeemer. The Derby embarrassment became a useful
show and fox-hunting horse.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drysdale, who won the 2000 Kentucky Derby with Fusaichi Pegasus,
might be making a return trip to Churchill Downs. Drysdale's
Japanese-bred son of Forty Niner, Sunday Break, won by two lengths
Friday at Santa Anita in his first try around two turns and is headed
for stakes competition next.... Edgar Prado has replaced Tony D'Amico
as the rider of Harlan's Holiday for the Florida Derby. D'Amico will
keep the mount on Repent, trainer Ken McPeek's other Kentucky Derby
prospect.</TE>

<HD>Norstrom Eager After Sweden's Flop</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Olympians are not due to report back to their NHL teams until
Tuesday, but Mattias Norstrom said that he will return to the Kings
on Sunday after taking three days off to decompress after Sweden's
stunning 4-3 loss to Belarus in the quarterfinals of the Olympic
hockey tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "You're only as good as your last game and my last game was not a
fun experience," the King captain said Friday. "If there's anything
good coming out of this, [it's that] I'm not tired of hockey. I
really look forward to coming back to play for the Kings and winning
some games and putting this behind me."</LD>
<LD>   The loss to Belarus, following the Swedes' 3-0 sweep through the
seeding round, was described as one of the most bitter in Swedish
sports history. Sweden had 18 NHL players on its roster, Belarus one.</LD>
<TE>   "You talk about Canada, all the pressure they have on their team,"
Norstrom said, "but hockey is a real big sport back home and it gets
a lot of media attention. So, if you do well, you get a lot of
credit. But if you lose, you take a lot of heat. It's been pretty
ugly back home. It's not fun, but it's part of hockey in Sweden."</TE>
<TE>   A two-time Olympian who helped his country win the gold medal at
the World Championships in 1998, Norstrom called the Salt Lake City
Games "the best international experience I ever had. I never had so
much fun playing."</TE>
<TE>   Up until Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "An ugly way to end it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eric Belanger, who underwent surgery Jan. 29 to repair ligament
damage in his left wrist, resumed skating Thursday and had the cast
removed from his wrist Friday. The second-year center hopes to return
to practice the last week of March, as scheduled, and return to the
lineup in April.</TE>

<HD>Jackson: Incident Forgotten</HD>

<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Phil Jackson smiled and offered a boys-will-be-boys explanation.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant put an arm around Samaki Walker as the power forward
sat by his locker stall before Friday night's game against the
Charlotte Hornets and received treatment for the hyperextended elbow
that has forced him onto the injured list.</LD>
<LD>   By Friday, Walker's brief fight with Bryant on the Laker bus
Thursday in Cleveland was being downplayed by all parties.</LD>
<TE>   According to sources, a discussion between Bryant and Walker on
the way to a shoot-around became intense and ended violently when
Bryant landed a punch under Walker's right eye.</TE>
<TE>   Quick action by bodyguards on the bus prevented Walker from
retaliating.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just juvenile play," Jackson said. "To be honest, I did
not think too much about it although there was a noticeable mark on
[Walker]. The incident has been resolved. It was resolved by game
time [Thursday]."</TE>
<TE>   Said Walker: "We've still got love for each other. I think this
adds a little character to the team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Jackson wasn't about to fine anybody in the incident, or
criticize Bryant about his flare-up, he was also not about to pass up
an opportunity to tease Bryant about Portland's Ruben Patterson, the
former Laker who calls himself the "Kobe Stopper."</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, Patterson was at it again, playing a key role in
Portland's victory over the Lakers while trash talking with Bryant up
and down the court.</TE>
<TE>   So when the subject of Thursday's trade between the Dallas
Mavericks and the Denver Nuggets came up Friday and Jackson was asked
if another former Laker, Nick Van Exel, can be a factor in the
playoffs with the Mavericks, Jackson replied: "I don't think Nick Van
Exel is a Laker killer. Ruben Patterson is the true Laker killer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As he was poised to make the game-winning shot Friday night,
Bryant couldn't help but think back to the closing seconds Tuesday
night against the Boston Celtics at Staples Center when he put up a
shot that was ruled too late by the length of one fingertip.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to hit one that counts," he said of Friday's final
points.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Celtic game, they took one away."</TE>
<TE>   He also thought back to his youth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what every kid dreams of in his backyard," Bryant said. "The
clock is running down ... 10 ... nine.... I never did miss one of
those as a kid."</TE>
<TE>   And rarely as an adult.</TE>

<DH>Pro basketball: A day after punching Walker on team bus,
Bryant hits jumper at 0:00 to beat Hornets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant was in his favorite spot Friday night, ball in his hands,
a defender in his face, game on the line and only a few seconds on
the clock at the Charlotte Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   Bryant drove right, pump-faked Charlotte Hornet defender George
Lynch once, took a step to his left and, with eight-tenths of a
second remaining in the game, let go of a jumper from 18 feet that
fell through the net as time expired.</LD>
<LD>   Lakers 96, Hornets 94.</LD>
<TE>   The sellout crowd of 23,799 was stunned. Bryant's teammates
swarmed around him.</TE>
<TE>   And the first one off the bench to join in the celebration was
Samaki Walker, a big smile on his face.</TE>
<TE>   Forgotten was an incident 24 hours earlier on the team bus when,
on the way to a shoot-around in Cleveland, Bryant and Walker engaged
in a discussion that grew heated and culminated with Bryant throwing
a punch that landed under Walker's right eye.</TE>
<TE>   Before Walker could respond, bodyguards stepped in.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a teammate," Walker, who is on the injured list, said Friday
after congratulating Bryant on his last-second heroics. "This is the
time of the year when frustrations flare. It was good to see the
intensity."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant downplayed the bus incident. "There was nothing to it," he
said. "We're fine. It was not a season-turner."</TE>
<TE>   Neither was Friday night's victory. Teams that are 37-16, as the
Lakers are, are perfectly happy with the direction the season is
going.</TE>
<TE>   But the dramatic win may have snapped the Lakers out of a low
period in a long regular season, a period that included the first
three-game losing streak in Phil Jackson's reign as Laker coach,
followed by a lethargic Thursday night victory against the Cleveland
Cavaliers.It appeared the Lakers had shaken all the lethargy out of
their sneakers in the first quarter Friday, running up a 10-point
lead, threatening to run the Hornets out of the Coliseum and all the
way to New Orleans, where they might move next season.</TE>
<TE>   But then the Hornets, 27-27 and looking for a season-making
victory, put the brakes on the Lakers and took off with a 19-4 run
sparked by Jamaal Magloire. The 6-foot-11, 259-pound second-year man,
refusing to be intimidated by Shaquille O'Neal in the middle,
accounted for eight of those 19 points with four dunks.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal also made his presence felt before the game was over,
leading the Lakers with 31 points and making 12 of 18 shots. But he
had only five points in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It was the opposite for Bryant, who scored 11 of his 21 points in
the final 12 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers needed all the offense they could muster to keep pace
with guard Baron Davis. The former UCLA Bruin was all over the court,
making shots from inside and out, connecting on 13 of 21 tries for 37
points, one shy of his career high.</TE>
<TE>   He was four for seven from three-point range. He was also
unstoppable at times on drives to the basket. On one drive, he blew
past Rick Fox, found O'Neal blocking his path but smoothly sailed
past, going under O'Neal's outstretched left arm to lay the ball in.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost," Davis said. "That's it. There's no time for moral
victories."</TE>
<TE>   The Hornets were victorious on the boards, outrebounding the
Lakers, 48-39. The Lakers have been outrebounded in each of their
last two games, and O'Neal has struggled in both. After getting 17
rebounds in his first game off the injured list, he had four against
Cleveland and seven against Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately it came down to Bryant, and the Lakers will gladly
settle for that most games.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's three-point play had given the Lakers a 94-92 lead with
39 seconds to play. Charlotte's P.J. Brown made a 16-foot jump shot
to tie the score with 9.7 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine seconds is a long time," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   Especially with the ball in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Fox passed the ball in to O'Neal who passed it back to Fox. With
four seconds to play, Fox delivered it to Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   As he sat on the court after the shot, staring up at the clock,
which read 0:00, Bryant relished the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unbelievable feeling to hit a buzzer-beater on the road,"
Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   "The opponents can't do nothing. It's over."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's smile was ear to ear.</TE>
<TE>   So was Walker's.</TE>

<LD>As a UCLA alum, I often get phone calls from UCLA telemarketing
students asking for donations. Sometimes I have to invent an excuse
not to give. No more! Now I can say, "When Lavin's gone, I'll give,
but not a cent until then."</LD>

<TE>   You have to give Steve Lavin credit. Faced with a team losing both
its confidence and poise; criticized for poor coaching decisions and
even poorer timeout calls; he made the one coaching adjustment
against Cal designed to right the ship and establish momentum for the
coming Pac-10 tournament: He had the players wear matching headbands.
Boy, what a coach!</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Levine</TE>
<TE>   Tarzana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   OK. That does it. I can't take any more of this roller-coaster
ride called UCLA basketball. Every other game I have exulted in
another gig in the win column. Then, two or three days later, hopes
of a great season are dashed. So now, it's officially, finally over
for me. I can't survive this season any more.</TE>
<TE>   You're killing me, Larry!</TE>
<TE>   Sue Coventon</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lavin's real blunder in UCLA's loss to Arizona State wasn't
the timeout with just over two seconds to play, when the game's
outcome was virtually decided. It was his call for a timeout with
nine seconds to go and the outcome still very much up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   He allowed Arizona State to regroup and, needing three points to
tie, not only had his best three-point shooter (Kapono) inbound the
ball, but he brings it in to the worst free-throw shooter (Bozeman)
on the floor!</TE>
<TE>   I don't believe I have ever witnessed a coach actually lose a game
for his team before, but Lavin came as close as you can.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Weiss</TE>
<TE>   Agoura Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've been willing to give Steve Lavin the benefit of the doubt,
but this has gone way too far.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins look lost on offense. Dan Gadzuric has shown almost no
improvement in four years. There's no point guard (what, Lav didn't
know Earl Watson and Baron Davis would eventually leave school?).
They all run around passing the ball, no one sets screens, no one
cuts to the basket, and I don't think anyone has seen a pick-and-roll
in years.</TE>
<TE>   Hey Lav, that shadow isn't John Wooden ... it's the Grim Reaper
coming to collect.</TE>

<LD>Gary Sheffield has become a pitiable individual. His pathetic
comments regarding Jim Tracy and Shawn Green upon arriving at the
Braves' camp continue to reveal what we already knew. The Braves
acquired a petty, jealous, immature, insecure little boy of wondrous
on-field talents, whose negatives, which include a total inability to
keep his big mouth shut, far outweigh those talents.</LD>
<LD>   The type of person Sheffield is has made every team for which he
has ever played regret ever getting him and making each of their
decisions to unload him a no-brainer.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Smith</LD>
<TE>   San Gabriel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So Gary Sheffield is praising the Braves and putting down the
Dodgers, all before having even played a single exhibition game for
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Is this even worthy of newsprint? Isn't this the same way he
reacts every time he gets traded? Didn't he have similar glowing
remarks to say about the Dodgers when Florida shipped him off?</TE>
<TE>   If he thought the Dodgers gave Green preferential treatment, just
wait until Gary realizes that the Braves have even more talented
players than the Dodgers did last year. It's a shame that Sheffield's
ego will always stand in the way of his becoming a truly great
player.</TE>

<LD>It's Sunday afternoon and instead of watching the Lakers, I'm looking
at cars parked. No, I'm not on the 405 freeway, I'm tuned to NBC. So
bitter NBC must be about losing the television rights to the NBA,
that instead of cutting away, or even going to a split screen from
the parking lot called the Daytona 500, NBC forces us to watch cars
stacked bumper to bumper going nowhere instead of delivering the
Laker game to us. Note to NBC: When Southern Californians want to see
cars going nowhere, they get on the nearest freeway.</LD>
<LD>   To add to the insult they stay at Daytona after the race for
"interviews," which by the fourth driver dipping his head to show off
a sponsor's logo on his cap, it becomes apparent these are not
"interviews," just shameless corporate promotion.</LD>
<LD>   Brilliant effort, NBC. Thank God you're losing the NBA to go along
with the NFL.</LD>

<TE>   Listen, Kobe is good. Kobe is entertaining. But we all know that
if anyone ever mouthed off about being a "Jordan Stopper," His
Airness would proceed to light the mouth up for 40, and plug up the
so-called stopper's scoring. Just ask Gary Payton and a host of
others. Arrogance has its price. Kobe is no 23.</TE>

playing quality hoops in January and February. But have you once
included their coach in that equation?</TE>
<TE>   This guy is arguably the best coach in NBA history, but now he
seems satisfied to sit by and watch this travesty called Laker
basketball. I know $6 million a year is not much, but could you at
least pretend to show some interest?</TE>
<TE>   If you writers won't call Phil out, at least publish this letter,
and let me do it. Steve Lavin, who isn't a blip on the radar compared
to Phil, at least admits, "It's always your fault when you're in
charge."</TE>

<LD>Last week your muckraking Page 2 columnist was wandering around
Riviera with a note pad and pencil asking everyone in sight, "Why
would you attend a golf tournament when Tiger Woods isn't playing?"
The results of that survey produced a column that was insipid even by
T.J. Simers' low standards.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently some 45,872 golf fans who showed up Sunday at Riviera
failed to read the scribe's pathetic drivel and saw an excellent golf
tournament despite the absence of the Tiger. My suggestion would be
to put T.J. on special assignment and have him interview each of
these 45,872 fans and ask them the same question he proffered last
week. Maybe that will keep him busy and off Page 2 for a while.</LD>

I've sent him the autographed picture he requested (27 times!). And
please tell him that I cannot host that show he does on Sunday
nights, no matter how abysmal his ratings are. Tell him to stop
asking!</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Dwyre, encourage him to keep doing what he does best--"real"

<LD>Over the past few months, I've watched, listened and read people's
opinions on Chick Hearn. For the most part, everyone wants him back.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there are a few idiots who want Chick to hang it up. I
can't even explain the anger I feel toward those people. Chick is the
best announcer the NBA has ever had. No one even comes close to him,
even now when he makes mistakes.</LD>
<LD>   Well, it's time to see if the Lakers really do care about Chick.
It's their fault that Chick wanted to go out Sunday night to forget
about another ugly loss.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps NBC was at fault too for showing only a little more than
half of the game so they can interview the losers of some stupid
race.</TE>
<TE>   So what do the Lakers do now? This is as good a time as any to
take every game seriously, just like Chick.</TE>
<TE>   And what greater motivation is there than to dedicate the rest of
the season and another championship to the voice of the Lakers? To do
anything less is unacceptable. After all, it is the Lakers that broke
Chick's heart and eventually his hip on Sunday night.</TE>

<LD>It was so inspiring to read about Mo Vaughn and his happiness to be
back on the East Coast. Too bad he had to be blinded by all those
millions of dollars the Angels threw at him to entice him out here
and he thus failed to realize that this part of the country is so
"laid back." That must have had a great deal to do with his playing,
which was "laid back" most of the time.</LD>
<LD>   I, for one, am just too mellowed out to miss him, but I have a
feeling that the Mets are going to find out that players like Mo
can't turn it on and off whenever they feel like it. Mo might just
continue his laid-back approach in New York. I doubt that the Angels
will miss him or his attitude.</LD>

as I've taken a liking to Jon Gruden, and watched him transform the
team into serious contenders. Now that Al Davis has traded Gruden
away, I have lost that conflicted feeling, and can return to my
natural instincts. The Raiders have just lost the best thing they've
had in years. Thanks, Al!</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not supposed to be easy winning a Southern Section Masters
wrestling championship, but Mario Estrada of Santa Ana Calvary Chapel
sure made it look that way in the first two rounds of the tournament
Friday at Fountain Valley High.</LD>
<LD>   Estrada, the only previous champion entered, breezed through his
first two matches, pinning Israel McMillan of El Dorado 1:00 in the
first round, then pinning Danny Leyva of Hesperia in 1:05 in the
second round.</LD>
<LD>   His quest to win a second title resumes today with a quarterfinal
match against Ryan Montgomery of Huntington Beach Edison.</LD>
<TE>   "I really didn't want to wrestle that quick," said Estrada,
wrestling at 119 pounds this year after winning the 103-pound class
in 2001. I like to get into my matches and work a few moves, but it's
hard to do that when the guy you're wrestling just grabs you."</TE>
<TE>   Wrestlers were in survival mode Friday, when outside temperatures
soared into the 80s, creating sauna-like conditions inside the
Fountain Valley gym. The thick, stuffy air was as much of an opponent
as any wrestler.</TE>
<TE>   The conditions took a toll on some of the favorites. Among the
notable upsets were Mario Arguilles of Santa Maria Righetti losing to
Eric Melgares of Dana Hills at 130 pounds, Mike O'Hara of Redlands
East Valley losing to Danny Moreno of Sierra Vista at 135 pounds, and
Yuri Kalika of Calvary Chapel losing to Daniel Contreras of El Modena
at 160 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Temecula Valley, which had a tournament-best 12 wrestlers qualify
for the Masters, had five of those advance to the quarterfinals,
including favorites Jeff Bristol at 140 pounds and Jeremy Mendoza at
119 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Calvary Chapel has six wrestlers in the quarterfinals, the most of
any team.</TE>
<TE>   Estrada, who said his goal is to join former Calvary Chapel
wrestlers Adam Bones Joey Calavitta as the only three-time Masters
champions in school history, said survival is always the name of the
game on the first day of the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "You just want to get through your first two matches," Estrada
said. "That's all. Once you lose, it's tough to come back."</TE>
<TE>   If Estrada reaches the finals, he likely will face Andrew
Domingues of Righetti or Mendoza, both of whom have defeated Estrada.</TE>

<HD>Murray Back in Hospital</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Severe headaches return as King coach recovers from
last week's auto accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An exact date for Andy Murray's return to the Kings was in doubt
Friday when the coach suffered another setback in his recovery from
last week's single-vehicle accident in Wisconsin.</LD>
<LD>   Murray, scheduled to fly into Los Angeles late Friday night to
rejoin the Kings for practice this morning in El Segundo, instead
spent the night in a hospital near his home in Faribault, Minn.,
after experiencing severe headaches and vomiting for the second time
in three days, his wife said.</LD>
<LD>   Ruth Murray planned to have an ambulance take her husband into
Minneapolis, about a 60-minute drive from Faribault, to see a
neurologist today.</LD>
<TE>   "He's got to realize it was only a week ago that he was in the
accident," she said, "but he's getting frustrated that he's not
getting any better, and he probably should be getting a little
better. But now he's getting worse."</TE>
<TE>   Murray, 50, suffered a concussion, four broken ribs, a separated
left shoulder and numerous cuts and scrapes on the morning of Feb. 15
when the pickup truck he was driving skidded off icy Interstate 90
outside Sparta, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   His wife said that the coach will undergo an MRI test on his brain
today in order to better evaluate the concussion. CT scans revealed
no bleeding, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that she spoke Friday night with King General Manager
Dave Taylor, who told her, "Just tell Andy to take as much time as he
needs."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, battling for a playoff spot in the competitive Western
Conference, resume their season Tuesday night at Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point," Taylor said from Salt Lake City, where he is
attending the Winter Olympics, "we're optimistic that Andy will be
ready for the game on Tuesday. And if not, we'll have to make some
other plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have to wait to see what the neurologist says."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, assistant coaches Dave Tippett, Mark Hardy and
Ray Bennett will continue running practice in Murray's absence,
Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Murray was en route from Faribault to Madison, Wis., to watch his
17-year-old son, Braden, play in a high school hockey tournament when
he lost control of the truck.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle was demolished after crashing through a wire fence and
rolling several times down an embankment through a wooded area.</TE>
<TE>   After a tree stopped the truck, its wheels up, only a few feet
from the edge of a trout stream, Murray kicked out a window and
crawled out of the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, he felt better and was eager to return to work. He was
booked on a Wednesday flight to Los Angeles. But after experiencing
headaches and vomiting overnight, symptoms of post-concussion
syndrome, he was advised by his doctors to rest for 48 hours.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, his symptoms returned. His wife said he was so dizzy
that he couldn't move his head from side to side. "He just said,
'I've got to get [checked] again because I'm not getting any
better.'"</TE>
<TE>   Said Taylor: "Obviously, he took quite a jolt in the accident. He
was pretty optimistic the day after, but a lot of times, particularly
with a head injury, symptoms come on a day or two later. That's what
he's experienced here.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want him to rest at this point and get feeling better."</TE>

<HD>Nets Prove They're the Team</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets don't have a rivalry with the New York Knicks
anymore. Instead, it's a mismatch.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Kidd had 17 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds and
single-handedly halted New York's rally from a 29-point deficit in
leading the Nets to a 115-93 victory over the Knicks on Friday night
at East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   "We're just a better ball team, basically," second-year forward
Kenyon Martin said after the Nets posted their third lopsided victory
over the Knicks this season.</LD>
<TE>   "They've been the team in this area for so long," Martin added.
"We go out with extra emphasis on these games. Everybody always
downplayed what we've been doing. We want everybody to realize we're
the better team in this area."</TE>
<TE>   A glance at the standings will confirm that. The Nets (37-17) not
only hold a 161/2-game lead over the last-place Knicks (20-33) in the
Atlantic Division, they also have the best record in the Eastern
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We understand the tradition and the reputation that the Knicks
have," said Kidd, who has transformed the Nets from a laughingstock
into a title contender in less than a year. "They were so dominant
for years. We want to fill those shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Richard Jefferson had a career-high 22 points and Kerry
Kittles had 20 as the Nets had six players in double figures in
winning their fifth consecutive and sending the Knicks to their
fourth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   It also gave New Jersey a five-game winning streak over New York,
the first time that's happened since an 11-game run from 1983-86.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a better basketball team right now, that's what it boils
down to," Knick point guard Mark Jackson said. "They're a better
basketball team. It's as simple as that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 80, Toronto 72--Clifford Robinson scored 21 points and
former Raptor Corliss Williamson had 12 of his 17 points in the
fourth quarter as the Pistons set a franchise record with their
seventh consecutive road victory.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unbelievable. We're on an unbelievable run right now,"
Jerry Stackhouse said. "We're putting up numbers against some of the
best that's ever done it for the Pistons, so we're really proud about
that."</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis had 17 points and 13 rebounds for the Raptors, who
have lost seven consecutive since Vince Carter went on the injured
list with a strained quadriceps. Toronto is 2-15 without Carter over
the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 103, Indiana 93--Andre Miller scored 27 points and Ricky
Davis had 20 at Indianapolis as the Cavaliers spoiled the debut of
the new-look Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to slide in quietly and slide out quietly while you're
all still excited about the trade," Cleveland Coach John Lucas said.</TE>
<TE>   New Pacer Brad Miller started at center, made four of his first
seven shots and led Indiana with 21 points before fouling out with
under a minute left.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 91, Phoenix 83--Jalen Rose scored 22 points, Marcus Fizer
had 21 and Tyson Chandler had 16 points and eight rebounds at Chicago
for the Bulls, who are 2-0 since adding Rose in a trade earlier this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity, not only for myself but for those
guys to get better and learn how to win," said Rose, who played all
48 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury had 27 points and rookie Joe Johnson--acquired
from Boston on Wednesday--tied his career high with 23 points and set
a new one with 11 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 116, Golden State 112--Ray Allen made four free throws
in the final 11.1 seconds to cap a fourth-quarter comeback at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised I made those two free throws," said Allen,
who had a bloody nose after grabbing his career-high 13th rebound.
"It wouldn't stop bleeding. I tried to suck it back in and got a
headache."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Richardson scored a career-high 35 points, but it wasn't
enough as Golden State lost its fifth consecutive and 20th in its
last 23.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 99, Atlanta 96--Gary Payton and Jerome James had baskets
and Desmond Mason made two free throws in the final minute as the
SuperSonics won at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Mason was fouled deliberately by Dion Glover and made his free
throws with 12.2 seconds left after Atlanta's Jason Terry made a
three-pointer with 13.1 seconds left. Shareef Abdur-Rahim of the
Hawks missed a three-pointer over Payton in the final seconds.</TE>

<HD>Kemp Is Suspended Indefinitely</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Portland Trail Blazer forward Shawn Kemp was suspended indefinitely
without pay by the NBA on Friday for violating terms of the league's
anti-drug agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The NBA said the suspension will continue until he has resumed
full compliance with his treatment program. Kemp, who also has
battled weight problems, left the Trail Blazers late last season for
treatment of cocaine abuse.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously we're very sadly disappointed, but we're very
supportive of Shawn and his efforts in his personal life. We're
pulling for Shawn," Blazer President and General Manager Bob Whitsitt
said.</LD>
<TE>   Kemp, who signed a seven-year, $98-million contract in 1997 after
moving from Seattle to Cleveland, is averaging 5.8 points, 3.2
rebounds and 13.6 minutes in 52 games this season, his second with
Portland. Each game Kemp misses will cost him $141,889 of his
$12.77-million salary.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to Shawn a little while ago," Trail Blazer Coach Maurice
Cheeks said. "He's a little sad, a little disappointed in himself. He
says he's going to come back, he's going to do everything he has to
do to get back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Houston Rocket guard Steve Francis will undergo tests Monday at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., to determine the cause of
recurring migraine headaches.</TE>
<TE>   Francis has missed five games this season because of the problem
and has played in other games with the headaches.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to double-check everything," team physician Dr.
Walter Lowe said.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockets have tested Francis but have not pinpointed the reason
for the headaches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Seattle SuperSonics put starting power forward Vin Baker on
the injured list because of three dislocated toes on his left foot.
Baker, injured against the Lakers on Feb. 14, has a protective boot
on his left foot and is out indefinitely.... Forward Jerome Williams
has been activated from the injured list by the Toronto Raptors, who
also put center Mamadou N'diaye on the list with an injured foot.
Williams missed nine games because of a high ankle sprain.... New
Jersey Net center Todd MacCulloch was put on the injured list because
of inflammation in the arch of his left foot. While bothered by the
foot for weeks, MacCulloch missed his first game of the season
Tuesday. Forward Donny Marshall was activated from the injured list
to take MacCulloch's place on the roster.... Cleveland Cavalier
backup point guard Bimbo Coles will have arthroscopic knee surgery
Monday. Coles was put on the injured list Feb. 15 and has missed the
last four games.</TE>

<LD>Venus Williams, playing with what appeared to be an injured leg, was
upset by Sandrine Testud, 1-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, Friday in the semifinals
of the Dubai Women's Open in the United Arab Emirates.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who was 5-0 against Testud, needed only 21 minutes to
win the first set, then left the court for unspecified medical
treatment and struggled when she returned, apparently bothered by her
left knee.</LD>
<LD>   "Sandrine played a lot better than me," said Williams, who refused
to talk about any injury. "I am really disappointed as I hate to
lose. But it is impossible to win when you miss every shot."</LD>
<TE>   In the final, Testud will play No. 3 Amelie Mauresmo, who defeated
second-seeded Monica Seles, 6-4, 6-3.</TE>

<TE>   It was the fifth pole of Craven's career and his second since
joining Wells' team last season.</TE>

<HD>Messier's Season Might Be Over</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Messier of the New York Rangers might face season-ending
shoulder surgery.</LD>
<LD>   Messier, who turned 41 last month, took advantage of the NHL's
break for the Olympics to visit Toronto this week for three high
intensity ultrasound treatments on his ailing left shoulder. He told
the New York Post he is considering an operation.</LD>
<LD>   "There's no structural damage, but I might have to have it
scoped," Messier said in Friday's editions. "I'm going to wait for at
least a couple of weeks to see where I am, but worst case, that is a
possibility."</LD>
<TE>   Messier missed 11 consecutive games and 15 of 18 before playing in
the last five before the Olympic break. He had one power play assist
and a minus-five rating in the five games.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said he was taking anti-inflammatory drugs that masked the
pain and enabled him to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't keep doing that," he said. "As soon as I went off them, I
couldn't lift my arm."</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers said Friday that nothing had changed with Messier's
status.</TE>

<DL>OGDEN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Canada's Kevin Martin has a new title: The Best Curler Without a
Major Championship.</LD>
<LD>   Norway won the gold medal in Olympic curling Friday, beating
favored Canada, 6-5, in a stunner when Martin's final throw, the last
of the tournament, slid past the blue scoring button.</LD>
<LD>   "I heard the sweepers say it was heavy all the way," said Norway's
captain, Paal Trulsen, meaning Martin's stone was moving too fast. "I
don't think he misses many of those draws."</LD>
<TE>   With King Harald of Norway watching from the stands, Trulsen was
closer to the mark on his final throw than Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a little deep, about an inch," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   The mostly Canadian crowd of 1,500 rose to its feet and cheered as
Martin's rock rumbled down the ice sheet. But it was Trulsen who
raised his arms in victory when the Canadian stone kept sliding.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an easy shot to win the game," Martin said. "It was less
than an inch. I'll be fine. You just hate to miss the last shot."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Switzerland beat Sweden, 7-3, for the bronze medal.</TE>
<TE>   Martin is one of the world's top skips. He's president of the
World Curling Players Assn. and runs an Edmonton curling academy, a
star in a land where curlers have agents and the sport ranks second
only to hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," Norway's Flemming Davanger said. "They've
very good. Everybody thought Canada was going to win."</TE>
<TE>   For years, though, the knock on Martin has been that he doesn't
have an international title.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll make that [last shot] more than I'll miss it,"
Martin said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Martin's team placed second at the World Championships in 1991 and
fourth in 1997, and placed fourth when curling was a demonstration
sport at the 1992 Albertville Games.</TE>
<TE>   In the bronze-medal match, Sweden's captain, Peja Lindholm, showed
a sense of humor in his ninth-end concession after a medal-clinching
toss by Switzerland's captain, Andreas Schwaller.</TE>
<TE>   Schwaller's stone in the eighth started a billiards-style
combination, knocking the Swedes out of scoring position and
eliminating any chance of scoring the two points they were in
position to gain. That shot left the center of the house wide open.
Since that's where all the points are scored, Lindholm only needed to
put his final rock on target. Lindholm missed. Instead of pulling
Sweden within two, Switzerland led decisively, 7-3.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the ninth, Lindholm conceded by holding his rock and
sliding down the 146-foot ice sheet. Players are supposed to release
the stone after a short slide from the starting hack.</TE>
<TE>   Translation: Game over.</TE>

<HD>The Bear Seeks a Scapegoat for a Reason</HD>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Russians have this expression: Who's guilty?</LD>
<LD>   "They look for someone to blame, a scapegoat, when anything goes
wrong," Robert Edelman, a Russian history professor at UC San Diego,
was saying by telephone Friday. "It's an unpleasant side of the
culture."</LD>
<LD>   We in the United States have a similar expression.</LD>
<TE>   It's called passing the buck.</TE>
<TE>   I called Edelman, one of the nation's leading authorities on
Soviet/Russian sports, to ask his opinion of the Russian Olympic
Committee's threat to boycott Sunday's closing ceremony if its sudden
barrage of protests--the latest concerned Russian Irina Slutskaya's
second-place finish to American Sarah Hughes in figure skating--isn't
taken seriously by the International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   He explained that Russian officials are under considerable heat at
home, and not merely from the sports fan on the street but also from
the sports fan in the Kremlin, President Vladimir Putin.</TE>
<TE>   For all the change in Russia under previous President Boris
Yeltsin, he didn't spend much time on sports outside of an occasional
tennis match for the benefit of photographers.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the old Soviet regime was still in place when Putin came
to power and appointed a new team, including ROC President Leonid
Tyagachev. But Putin didn't stop there. An ice hockey fan, he all but
handpicked Viacheslav Fetisov to coach the Olympic team.</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake about it, ROC officials answer to Putin.</TE>
<TE>   He was already peeved at them last week because they lost what
many Russians considered a propaganda war with the Canadians in the
pairs figure skating controversy. Putin believed they acquiesced too
much when the International Skating Union, with the IOC's blessing,
awarded a second gold medal to the Canadian pair.</TE>
<TE>   But the larger issue concerns the performance of Russian athletes,
who, through Thursday, had won a mere 14 medals. ROC officials had
predicted 23.</TE>
<TE>   They've got some explaining to do.</TE>
<TE>   Their explanation: We wuz robbed.</TE>
<TE>   It is playing in Red Square.</TE>
<TE>   It has been playing well here too among most of the Russian media.
But not all.</TE>
<TE>   A reporter during a Thursday news conference asked Tyagachev if he
was creating controversy to distract the Russian public from the
medal count.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are you from?" Tyagachev demanded.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia," the reporter said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not possible that you are from Russia and could ask such a
question," Tyagachev said.</TE>
<TE>   Tyagachev might be a modern Russian bureaucrat, stylish and
well-spoken, but his was a pre-glasnost response.</TE>
<TE>   His rhetoric in the last two days has been reminiscent of Cold
War-era Soviet sports officials. It is borne in the insecurity
complex dating back to before Peter the Great about whether Russians
measure up to the rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles was
in large part revenge for the U.S.-led boycott of the 1980 Summer
Games in Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   But Peter Ueberroth, president of the L.A. organizing committee,
suspected that Marat Gramov, the head of Soviet sports at the time,
wholeheartedly endorsed the action.</TE>
<TE>   Gramov, he speculated, feared his athletes would be much less
successful on American soil than they had been at home in 1980 under
his predecessor, Sergei Pavlov.</TE>
<TE>   So the old Russian bear is growling again.</TE>
<TE>   I guess we should consider ourselves fortunate that they are
confining their bellicose threats to the sports world.</TE>
<TE>   But the problem within Russia is serious.</TE>
<TE>   After the Russian Revolution in 1917, sports became a concern of
the state for the promotion of patriotism and good health.</TE>
<TE>   The demise of communism created a similar challenge, because so
many young people in the country aren't aware of the sacrifices made
by their grandparents and great-grandparents in World War II, known
as the Great Patriotic War in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   There also is a perception among the country's leaders that the
majority of youth has become intoxicated by the allure of Western
frills. Edelman's</TE>
<TE>   excellent book on Soviet sports is titled "Serious Fun." Russian
kids today are more interested in just fun.</TE>
<TE>   The breakup of the Soviet Union has created other problems for
Russian winter athletes. The bobsled and luge track is in Latvia. The
speedskating oval is in Kazakhstan. There is not enough money to
maintain ice in the summer for skating rinks, meaning that many
Russian figure skaters must train abroad. The government also has
less money to support athletes, especially at the grass-roots level.</TE>
<TE>   Putin is aware of all of that, having asked Tyagachev to call a
meeting recently of all the country's athletic federation presidents
to discuss means of raising money to rebuild the Russian sports
empire.</TE>
<TE>   It is important, he told Tyagachev, for the country to win medals
to restore national pride and encourage young people to get off the
streets and back into the gyms. It is important, he said, for the
future of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   So Putin knows the true story here. He is too smart to buy the
Anglo-Saxon conspiracy theories advanced by his sports officials,
having already called off the boycott threat.</TE>
<TE>   But it's possible the Russians' 3-2 loss to the United States in
ice hockey Friday could make him reconsider.</TE>

<LD>You camped out in front of the TV set, armed with a chart of each
figure skater's music, short program jumps and long program
triple-triples, as well as the latest copy of Skating magazine. A
fresh tape was in the VCR, and your lucky charm was within reaching
distance for those white-knuckle moments.</LD>
<LD>   But it's all over now.</LD>
<LD>   Alexei Yagudin of Russia is the men's Olympic champion, Sarah
Hughes of the U.S. won the women's event, Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze of Russia are co-gold medalists with Jamie Sale and
David Pelletier of Canada--thanks to an investigation that found a
judge had been pressured before the competition and failed to report
it--and Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat of France have the ice
dance gold medal.</LD>
<TE>   What happens now?</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Olympic contests are over, figure skating junkies
shouldn't have any problems feeding their habit.</TE>
<TE>   There's one major event left in the competitive season: the World
Championships, which will be held March 15-24 at Nagano, Japan. Many
Olympic medal winners skip the World Championships because they
consider them anticlimactic after the Games. Most Salt Lake City
medalists haven't committed to anything, but six-time U.S. champion
Todd Eldredge, who finished sixth at Salt Lake City, has already said
he won't go to the World Championships. Matt Savoie, fourth at last
month's U.S. championships, will replace him on the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   ABC will show excerpts of the World Championships March 23 and 24
and April 6.</TE>
<TE>   Another way to get a figure skating fix is to scour the weekly TV
listings. Cable TV networks always seem to be playing a months-old
tape of a figure skating competition, so a search of the fine print
is likely to uncover a Grand Prix event or pro-am. With the element
of suspense removed, watch it this time to laugh at the most
outrageously bad costumes.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet is another good source of skating updates and a way
to find other skating fans who want to chat about a particular skater
or the sport. Iskater.com is probably the best, because it features
news, event reports and a discussion forum. The U.S. Figure Skating
Assn.'s site, www.usfsa.org, is also good for competition info,
biographies and schedules.</TE>
<TE>   And if you simply must see the likes of Hughes, Michelle Kwan or
Sasha Cohen again, the annual ice shows are a good bet.</TE>
<TE>   "Stars on Ice," which took an Olympic break, will resume Tuesday
and tour the country through April 20. However, it has already passed
through Southern California. But "Champions on Ice," which includes
many Salt Lake City medalists and past medalists, will tour from
April 3 until Aug. 11. It will come to Long Beach and Anaheim in
mid-July.</TE>

<HD>Skating Union Denies Protest by Russians</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The International Skating Union on Friday denied the Russian Figure
Skating Federation's protest of the judging in the women's figure
skating competition, leaving Irina Slutskaya with the silver medal
and Sarah Hughes of Great Neck, N.Y., with the gold.</LD>
<LD>   The protest, filed by Russian Figure Skating President Valentin
Piseev, was based on Tuesday's short program "where Slutskaya was
definitely the best but was still placed second," and on her
presentation scores in Thursday's long program.</LD>
<LD>   Slutskaya was ranked second in the short program and second again
in the long program. She complained after Thursday's finale that her
presentation scores didn't reflect the effort she had made to improve
them.</LD>
<TE>   "In other competitions I have higher marks in the second mark,"
said Slutskaya, who was expected to vie for the gold with U.S.
champion Michelle Kwan. "They're always 5.8s and 5.9s [out of 6.0],
and here I received 5.6s. I was shocked."</TE>
<TE>   ISU referee Britta Lindgren denied the protest without comment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Russian Olympic Committee President Leonid Tyagachev said
Thursday his country was threatening to pull out of the Games and
boycott Sunday's closing ceremony to protest what it alleges is an
anti-Russian bias, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday said
there will be no withdrawal. However, he maintained North American
athletes are being favored over Russian athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Russian politicians and sports officials have complained of unfair
treatment in cross-country skiing, where the Russian women's relay
team dropped out after leader Larissa Lazutina was banned for having
excessively high levels of hemoglobin, as well as in figure skating
and men's hockey.</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier dispute that threatened to overshadow the Games,
Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze won the gold medal
in pairs skating but later watched as their top rivals, Jamie Sale
and David Pelletier of Canada, were given duplicate gold medals after
a judging scandal was uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   Russia also complained about biased officiating in the Olympic
hockey tournament but did not carry out threats to pull its men's
team from the semifinals. Russia lost to the U.S., 3-2, in a
semifinal Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much you can do about it right now," Russian hockey
Coach Viacheslav Fetisov said. "An agreement's been signed that is
designed to have a final between Canada and the USA. You have this
final, you have NHL referees.... They live here, and they know the
North American players."</TE>
<TE>   Russia isn't alone in complaining North American athletes have
received favored treatment. South Korea earlier this week also
threatened to boycott the closing ceremony and protested to the Court
of Arbitration for Sport over the disqualification of short-track
speedskater Kim Dong-Sung.</TE>
<TE>   Kim finished first in the 1,500-meter race Wednesday night, but
American Apolo Anton Ohno was given the gold medal because the
referee said Kim blocked Ohno with half a lap to go.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Francois Carrard, director general of the IOC, said
South Korea had backed off its threat and would attend the Games'
closing show. "Fighting for their position in front of the [Court of
Arbitration for Sport] is one thing, but in the Olympic spirit, being
there participating in the closing ceremony, of course, is another
thing," Carrard said.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the good news. Although the figure skating competition
ended with the women's competition on Thursday, another protest was
filed Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Lithuanian Skating Federation, rebuffed by the ISU when it
protested the judging of the free dance portion of the ice dance
competition, took its appeal to the ISU's executive council.</TE>
<TE>   Lithuania contends its fifth-place duo of Margarita Drobiazko and
Povilas Vanagas would have finished higher if the judges had properly
penalized the higher-ranking Canadian and Italian couples for falls.
Barbara Fusar-Poli and Maurizio Margaglio of Italy won the bronze and
Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz of Canada finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   "It was patently unfair," John Domanskis, the Lithuanian National
Olympic Committee's attache, said of the judging. "It's pretty
unusual that a small country can get anywhere [with a protest]. It's
like a closed shop. But it becomes more and more obvious something is
going on.... The further we can take it, we're going to try, so we
can make a statement and see what we can do for our athletes in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   The ISU put off until April a decision on the fate of suspended
French judge Marie Reine Le Gougne, who was at the center of the
pairs controversy.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne and Didier Gailhaguet, head of the French figure skating
federation, were questioned this week about allegations she had been
pressured by Gailhaguet to vote for the Russian pair over the
Canadians, an approach she did not report to the ISU until after she
judged the competition and gave an advantage in the long program to
the Russians. Her scores gave them the gold on a 5-4 vote, although
Sale and Pelletier later got duplicate gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne has told conflicting stories, saying she was pressured
by Gailhaguet and then retracting that claim.</TE>

<LD>A Mexican American man, a Cuban American woman, a Japanese American
man, an African American woman, these have been our Olympic heroes.</LD>
<LD>   Derek Parra, dark hair, dark skin, dark eyes brimming with tears
and singing the words to the U.S. national anthem, a young man from
San Bernardino wins a speedskating gold medal and you can be sure
that right now, today, there are little boys in Milwaukee and Duluth,
in Palm Springs, Fla., and Palm Springs, Calif., in the desert, in
the swamps, little boys of different colors are asking their moms or
dads or grandmoms or granddads if they can't please, please have
speedskates and a trip to the ice rink.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Rodriguez, daughter of Cuban refugees, tan skin, sweet
smile, unassuming and shy and very, very fast wearing a pair of
skates, is overwhelmed by her emotions and embracing her two bronze
speedskating medals and showing us that we have a country where,
truly, anything is possible. It must be if a little girl from steamy
Miami can become one of the best speedskaters in the world.</LD>
<TE>   Apolo Anton Ohno, raised by his Japanese father, nearly lost to
juvenile delinquency and bad influences on the streets of Seattle,
has become a 19-year-old heartthrob ("I would do anything to meet
Apolo, he is so cool," said a young lady in front of a junior high
school Friday. Her friends all nodded enthusiastically) and a symbol
of toughness and class for the way he handled prickly situations in
short-track speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   Vonetta Flowers, an African American woman from Alabama, a
practitioner of a more traditional sport, track and field, until her
husband found a flier at a track meet looking for volunteers to push
a bobsled, wept and sang, sang and wept, during the national anthem,
wept and talked, talked and wept throughout her press conference
after winning a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   At the beginning of these Olympics, columns were written
chastising the U.S. and the Winter Olympics for being too
monochromatic, too white, too filled with iconoclastic backwoodsmen
from Vermont and Montana and without enough black, yellow and brown
athletes from our cities.</TE>
<TE>   As if these things can be forced.</TE>
<TE>   As if the United States Olympic Committee can just pluck Latino
boys or African American girls from Los Angeles or Atlanta and make
them into skiers or skaters or sledders.</TE>
<TE>   What is so cool about Parra and Rodriguez, Ohno and Flowers, is
that they found their own way to the ice and snow and they found
their way because, more than anything, they wanted to be Olympians
and represent their country.</TE>
<TE>   If someone wants to ask "Who's got next?" in the skating rinks and
ski and snowboard hills, the answer is going to be the U.S. because,
after these Winter Games, more and more kids of different ethnic
backgrounds are going to be drawn to the sports that have captured
our attention the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   More important than all the judging controversies and scoring
controversies and international wailing about "North American bias"
is the emergence in these Games of new faces. Just as the U.S. was in
the lead in making women's sports an appealing and popular part of
the Olympic program, the U.S. will be in the lead in making the
Winter Olympics truly multicultural.</TE>
<TE>   This won't make us any more popular. The 30-something medals the
U.S. will end up winning are only going to increase in Turin, Italy,
in four years if U.S. sports federations capitalize on Parra,
Rodriguez, Ohno and Flowers.</TE>
<TE>   A single bobsledder, Bonny Warner, put up fliers at a single track
meet in Sacramento and found Flowers. A single father, Yuki Ohno,
sent his recalcitrant son to Lake Placid to keep him out of trouble
and to have him take out his aggressive athletic talent on the ice
and not on the street. If U.S. speedskating officials are smart, they
will find a way to get to other fathers and mothers in the city and
figure out how to get some skating rinks built.</TE>
<TE>   Two in-line skaters, Parra and Rodriguez, were persuaded that
their Olympic dreams could only be fulfilled on the ice. So they put
away the wheels. U.S. speedskating officials should be scouring the
concrete sidewalks and walls for a few more like them. Dan Jansen and
Bonnie Blair are the past. The future is not in West Allis, Wis.,
home of this nation's best speedskating indoor ice facility. It's on
the streets and in the parks where kids are wearing kneepads and
helmets and wheels.</TE>
<TE>   The next great U.S. luger might be in Texas, the next great
speedskater could be in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   A Russian official, in the course of complaining about alleged
anti-Russian bias, said these Salt Lake Games had come to resemble
those of 1936 Berlin. This was meant as an insult, to compare the
U.S. with Nazi Germany.</TE>
<TE>   But in a way, the Russian was right. This is a little like 1936.</TE>
<TE>   In 1936 Jesse Owens showed the world that a man of color not only
deserved to play on the world's biggest sporting stage but that he
was good enough to win. And in winning, Owens showed the world that
sport was only made better by his participation, that a man of color
could set the bar higher, which is what great athletes in all
countries should want.</TE>
<TE>   Parra, Rodriguez, Ohno and Flowers have come to the Winter
Olympics and set the bar higher here at home. They've told us we'd do
well to find more Winter Olympians from unexpected places to come to
Turin in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   They've set the bar higher for the world, too. They won't be going
away, not now, not when little U.S. boys and girls of all colors
might want to be Winter Olympians.</TE>

<LD>If, as he says he might do next season, Derek Parra goes to Holland
for professional marathon speedskating, he'll fit right in.</LD>
<LD>   Speedskating is the national sport in the Netherlands and the
Dutch, who attend in droves, party hearty at every skating event.</LD>
<LD>   "That's where I got the idea to get involved with the crowd," said
Parra. "The people come to be entertained and speedskating should be
fun."</LD>
<TE>   Warming up in the infield before his 10,000-meter race Friday,
Parra gave the crowd a little something extra. He boogied to the
music of Kleintje Pils--Small Beer--the Dutch brass band that has
been playing during breaks this week at the Utah Olympic Oval.</TE>
<TE>   Then he ran a lap, finishing with an impromptu race against the
Zamboni.</TE>
<TE>   After putting on his skates, he punctuated warmup laps with crowd
waves, bounced in rhythm again when he went past the band, and pumped
a fist when he went past a section where a Derek Parra banner was
hanging.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone else just skated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Let's Have Geography for $1,000, Alex</TE>
<TE>   Austria and Australia may have similar spellings, but the
countries have never been confused as Winter Olympic powers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, until Thursday, Australia had one more gold than Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the Austrians would quibble, because their first gold was
scored in the prestigious downhill by Fritz Strobl while Australia
"earned" one of its two golds when three short-track speedskaters
fell down on the final lap of their race, allowing Steven Bradbury to
waltz home to victory.</TE>
<TE>   Still, an Aussie journalist couldn't help but chide Austria's
Stephan Eberharter after he pushed his country's gold medal count to
two after winning the men's giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Eberharter played along with the gag.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got two gold, how many do you got?" Eberharter asked the
guy. "And you're a much bigger country than Austria."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don't Blame Him, He's Just Doing His Job</TE>
<TE>   Ivica Kostelic, older brother of Croatia's Janica, figures to be
Bode Miller's main competition in today's men's slalom at Deer
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic leads the World Cup slalom standings while Miller ranks
second.</TE>
<TE>   Kostelic understands that most fans will be rooting for him to
lose.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll try to do my best," Kostelic said. "I'm not competing with
Bode, so please, American nation, don't get mad at me, I'm only
competing for myself."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can't Penetrate His Concentration Zone</TE>
<TE>   Miller says one of the keys to his success is his ability to
concentrate between morning and afternoon slalom runs.</TE>
<TE>   "If fans are cheering or asking for autographs, I don't really let
that affect me that much," Miller said. "Or, somebody could say
you're the worst skier in the world, you're definitely going to crash
this run. It doesn't bother me."</TE>

<TE>   Curling Champions Ready to Clean Up</TE>
<TE>   Stars of the Olympics' glamour events are virtually guaranteed to
move on to fame and fortune, and even the curling champions have a
chance to cash in.</TE>
<TE>   The British women's team that swept to the gold has been offered a
deal to promote floor cleaner.</TE>
<TE>   After winning Britain's first Winter Games gold since 1984, skip
Rhona Martin and her crew will have an offer awaiting them when they
return home.</TE>
<TE>   "The scrubbing movement by the team members is the ideal way to
test kitchen and bathroom floor cleaner," said a spokesman for the
Safeway chain.</TE>
<TE>   In curling, team members frantically sweep ahead of the stone to
melt a thin layer of ice, reducing friction and increasing the
distance the rock travels.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   But Did the Queen Watch the Curling?</TE>
<TE>   Even British Prime Minister Tony Blair got swept up by the curling
wave.</TE>
<TE>   On a trip to Scotland on Friday, he said, "I'm well aware that the
interest in Scotland today is not about my visit, but the absolutely
astonishing performance of the curling team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was wonderful, exciting, thrilling and a brilliant
performance, and well done to all the Scots who made up the British
team. Not just the whole of Scotland but the whole of Britain is
really proud of them."</TE>
<TE>   Prince Charles offered his congratulations too.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how proud I am of what you have achieved, to say
nothing of the good that your success will do for the ancient sport
of curling," he said in a message to the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now That's an Example of the Olympic Spirit</TE>
<TE>   Italy's Eugenio Monti won six Olympic medals--two of each
color--and is considered by many to be the best bobsled driver ever.</TE>
<TE>   It's not only his performance on the track that has earned him
distinction; it's also one very magnanimous gesture.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1964 Games in Innsbruck, Monti offered to withdraw from the
competition and loan his axle bolt to his rival, Britain's Tony Nash.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, Nash didn't need it. He ended up using his own
replacement axle bolt and won the gold medal in the two-man event,
while Monti took home the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Monti was awarded the first Pierre de Coubertin Award for his
offer to aid Nash. The two were reunited Thursday at a ceremony in
Park City, and the memory was still vivid.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a hell of a gesture, a lovely gesture," Nash said. "I
didn't know anything about it until my team told me at the top."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We Could Call Him Comrade Gretzky</TE>
<TE>   If it weren't for his grandfather's decision to flee his homeland
85 years ago, then leave the United States shortly afterward, Wayne
Gretzky might be running the Olympic hockey teams of America or
Belarus.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Gretzky is the chief of the Canadian men's team that
moved into Sunday's gold-medal game against the United States with a
7-1 semifinal win over Belarus on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky's grandfather, Tony, left what is now Belarus in 1917 and
traveled to Chicago with the intent of joining the U.S. Army.</TE>
<TE>   But, learning that the Canadian army paid better, Tony moved again
to Winnipeg, where he joined the military.</TE>
<TE>   Gretzky said his grandfather didn't leave Russia for political
reasons, but simply because living conditions were so poor.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have anything good to say about the place," Gretzky
said. "Like a lot of people, he just left."</TE>

<TE>   She Can Do Without Twilight's Last Gleaming</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-Canada women's hockey rivalry is only getting more
intense, with both teams sniping at each other and talking about a
rematch just hours after battling for the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   After Canada won a tightly contested final, 3-2, to even the
Olympic score at one gold medal apiece, the North Americans all but
promised to renew the series at the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Canadian players were incensed about a rumor that the Americans
had stomped on a Canadian flag. The U.S. players universally denied
they had done so.</TE>
<TE>   Canada's Vicky Sunohara even took a swipe at the "Star-Spangled
Banner," saying, "The anthem was a big thing, not wanting to hear
their anthem [at the medal ceremony] I don't dislike the U.S. anthem,
I just don't want to hear that after a game."</TE>

<TE>   Hey, We Have Mudslides  and Earthquakes Here</TE>
<TE>   So, just how does a warm-weather person from Southern California
get along in the mountains of Utah? Is our blood really thinner? Are
we really weather wimps?</TE>
<TE>   Rich Perelman of Los Angeles, the venue chief at Utah Olympic
Park, gave his assessment:</TE>
<TE>   "I got here Jan. 25," he said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "The first day, we were out doing a lot of greeting and we didn't
have our full Olympic clothing uniforms yet. It was sub-20 degrees
and so I had flu and walking pneumonia for about a week. That was
just standard for everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had days up here on the mountain that are prehistoric days.
You get grit and gravel and wind. It's like the wrath of God. The
only time somebody from L.A. sees anything like this is watching the
History Channel."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next We'll Find a Way to Work In Kevin Bacon</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe that's why they lost the Second World War."</TE>
<TE>   So spoken by U.S. men's hockey Coach Herb Brooks after being told
German Coach Hans Zach welcomed playing the Americans in the Olympic
quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Just wondering, but doesn't that sound like something Gen. Omar
Bradley would say?</TE>
<TE>   Bear with us, because only a few degrees separate Brooks from
Bradley. The connecting link is actor Karl Malden, who played Bradley
in the 1970 movie "Patton" and Brooks in the 1981 made-for-TV movie
"Miracle on Ice."</TE>

<LD>NBC couldn't have scripted it any better.</LD>
<LD>   After getting a whopping national rating of 26.8 with a 41 share
for its women's figure skating Thursday night, the network can now
look forward to more big numbers on its 24th and final day of
coverage Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The big numbers will be for its daytime coverage.</LD>
<TE>   That's because the U.S. hockey team, after a dramatic 3-2 victory
over Russia on Friday, will play Canada on Sunday. The game will be
shown live at 11:30 a.m. across the country, including the West
Coast, on the big network, not cable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the biggest hockey game in the history of the sport," NBC
hockey host Jim Lampley said by phone from Salt Lake City on Friday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what Gary Bettman had in mind when he allowed NHL players
to play in the Olympics. For the U.S. to beat Russia twice and meet
Canada in the gold-medal game, this is the greatest thing that could
have possibly happened.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be the highest-rated hockey game in history."</TE>
<TE>   That's quite a prediction, considering the 1980 "Miracle on Ice"
game between the U.S. and Russia in Lake Placid, N.Y., got a 23.9
with a 37 share.</TE>
<TE>   NBC commentator John Davidson, a native of Ottawa, said, "Canada
hasn't won an Olympic gold medal since 1952, and hockey is their
sport. They want to prove they are No. 1 in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "In the game tonight, we saw the U.S. show passion for two periods
and the Russians show passion for one period.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sunday, it will be pure passion by both teams for three
periods. And if we're lucky, we'll see overtime."</TE>
<TE>   Davidson was making only one prediction--that the game will be
close.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No matter what kind of rating Sunday's game gets, these Olympic
Games are already a ratings success.</TE>
<TE>   After Thursday night--when the national rating peaked at 32.5 when
the Americans skated--the average rating for the Games rose to 19.3,
which is 18% higher than the 16.4 CBS had through 14 days at Nagano,
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   NBC has easily met all its rating guarantees to sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all in bonus time now," NBC chairman Bob Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   On projections of NBC bringing in $700 million in advertising,
Wright said, "The gross sales will be considerably higher than that."</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 79 million Americans watched at least part of NBC's
coverage Thursday night.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast continues to get some of the highest numbers, and
L.A. again beat the national average Thursday night. L.A. numbers got
a 31.0 rating with a 44 share.</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast had four of the seven highest-rated markets--
Portland was second at 40.5/60, Seattle fourth at 35.1/52, San
Francisco sixth 34.4/51, and Sacramento seventh at 33.6/47. L.A.
ranked 17th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coverage of Friday's U.S.-Russia game worked out fairly well for
West Coast viewers--as long as they had cable television and weren't
stuck in rush-hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The game was carried live in its entirety on CNBC. And the final
16:47 of the game was simulcast on CNBC and NBC.</TE>
<TE>   But because NBC's coverage was delayed here, there was only live
coverage on CNBC.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lampley's hockey background has been questioned by some who wonder
why he is hosting the sport. Granted, Lampley's background is more
closely related to the Olympics--these are his 11th Games as a
broadcaster--than hockey, but he was involved in the U.S. victory
over Russia in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Working as a reporter for ABC at Lake Placid, he was editing a
political piece when he got a call from ABC Sports President Roone
Arledge, who told him to go to the game and get ready to do live
postgame interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out to be the most amazing day of my 27 years in
broadcasting," Lampley said. "I watched the third period from a
photographers' platform."</TE>
<TE>   But there were no live postgame interviews to do right after the
game because the game was shown on tape-delay across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "So I took Jim Craig and Mike Eruzione out to dinner so we'd be
ready to a live interview in the streets of Lake Placid three hours
later," Lampley said. "There were about 2,000 people there to watch
us. It was quite a moment."</TE>
<TE>   Lampley is looking forward to more great hockey moments Sunday.</TE>

<KH>WHERE ARE THEY NOW?</KH>
<HD>Torvill and Dean: Perfect Partners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They danced across the ice at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo with
passionate perfection that secured their place in Olympic history.
Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean of Great Britain not only won the
gold medal in ice dancing for their stunning performance to Ravel's
"Bolero," they redefined their sport by receiving 12 perfect scores
out of 18 marks, including nine perfect scores for artistic
impression.</LD>
<LD>   "This is like the pinnacle we've been going towards the whole
time, since we put on skates," Dean said after winning the gold
medal. "Tonight we reached the pinnacle."</LD>
<LD>   Actually, it was only the beginning.</LD>
<TE>   After their Olympic victory, Torvill and Dean performed on
television specials, in the Ice Capades and eventually formed their
own touring company. They staged a comeback for the 1994 Winter Games
at Lillehammer, Norway, where they won the bronze medal, then skated
together professionally until 1998. In all, they performed "Bolero"
more than 1,500 times in their career for audiences around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Torvill, 44, married American Philip Christiansen in 1990 and
lives in Turnbridge Wells in England. Dean, 43, married Canadian
skater Isabelle Duchesnay in 1991. The couple divorced two years
later and, in 1994, Dean married American Jill Trenary, a former U.S.
and world figure skating champion. The couple has two sons and lives
in Colorado Springs, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Both Torvill and Dean continue to choreograph and coach other
skaters. They couldn't have predicted the success they would enjoy
when they became partners in 1975 in their hometown of Nottingham.
Torvill, who began skating at 8, already had won a British national
pairs title with partner Michael Hutchinson. She was working as an
insurance clerk when she met Dean, who left school at 16 and
eventually quit his job as a police cadet in Nottingham to pursue
training full time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, they won their first British national title and finished
fifth at the Lake Placid Olympics. The next year, they won the first
of four consecutive world championships and in 1984 made history with
their Valentine's Day routine at Sarajevo that told the tale of two
lovers who throw themselves into a lava pit because they cannot be
together. That performance continues to resonate.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Torvill and Dean were summoned to Buckingham Palace where
they received from Prince Charles insignias designating each an
Officer of the Order of the British Empire.</TE>

<LD>It took the Woodland Hills El Camino Real girls' soccer team a while
to get warmed up in its City Section quarterfinal game Friday. But
once it did, there was no stopping the Conquistadores, who scored
three goals in a 90-second span at the start of the second half en
route to a 6-0 victory over visiting Palisades.</LD>
<LD>   Nicole Walberg scored on a rebound in the 43rd minute to break a
scoreless tie, then Samantha Spencer scored a minute later on a high
shot to the right corner from 30 yards out. Kandice McLaughlin scored
from the same spot shortly after the Conquistadores gained possession
of the ensuing kickoff and second-seeded El Camino Real (16-3-1) was
off and running.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't have to say much at halftime. The girls knew what the
problem was--determination and attitude," El Camino Real Coach Scott
Holloway said. "Anything short of [the finals at] UCLA and these
girls will be disappointed. We can't live with losing in the
quarters."</LD>
<TE>   The defending champion Conquistadores host third-seeded Granada
Hills on Wednesday for the right to advance to the City finals on
March 2 at Drake Stadium. El Camino Real, the higher seeded team
because of a coin toss, and Granada Hills split their two meetings in
West Valley League play.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer, McLaughlin and Giuliana Facio scored the final three
goals as the Conquistadores outshot Palisades (14-7-1) by a 22-7
margin. El Camino has outscored its two playoff opponents, 17-0.</TE>

<HD>Waves Remain in Title Chase</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A once sure-fire NCAA tournament berth now made a little less certain
by its loss to Gonzaga, Pepperdine faced some monumental games this
week as it tries to claim a piece of the West Coast Conference
regular-season title.</LD>
<LD>   The pressure was on Friday night, but the Waves weren't fazed by
it against San Diego, remaining in a first-place tie by holding off
the Toreros, 90-79, before 1,725 at Firestone Fieldhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The victory adds to the importance of tonight's conference finale
against Santa Clara. A win for Pepperdine (19-7, 12-1) can clinch a
tie for the championship and the Waves win it outright if St Mary's
upsets Gonzaga.</LD>
<TE>   Pepperdine Coach Paul Westphal, who has embraced all the
tournament talk in his first season, said the Waves have been dealing
with their own self-induced pressure all year. Being on the NCAA
bubble isn't adding any more stress.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been playing for the tournament since the first game of the
season," Westphal said. "Every game, you've got to prove yourself.
The first thing is to win 20 games, then to win conference, then to
win the conference tournament and then we can take that next step."</TE>
<TE>   Terrance Johnson shook off the flu and a five-point effort at
Gonzaga with a team-high 23 points. Jimmy Miggins scored 22,
including 14 in the first half as Pepperdine built a 51-39 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Despite not having the services of key reserve Glen McGowan, the
Waves overwhelmed San Diego (14-12, 6-7) with depth and athleticism.
Add some hot outside shooting and they were unstoppable, at least for
20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine built its halftime lead by making 17 of its first 24
shots. Miggins had eight points in the first five minutes as he took
apart San Diego's interior defense with impressive spin moves for
easy short jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   "That [Gonzaga] game was one I wanted to make up for," Johnson
said. "Then I didn't practice but once this week so I was just trying
to get my rhythm back. I had it in the first half."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Gonzaga 70, San Francisco 54--Cory Violette scored 18 points
as Gonzaga celebrated its highest ranking ever with a victory at San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Dickau had 17 as the Bulldogs (25-3, 12-1) won their 10th
straight, and 22nd in 23 games overall.</TE>
<TE>   Shamell Stallworth scored 17 points to lead the Dons (12-14, 7-6),
who lost their third straight despite playing before their first
sellout crowd of the season. San Francisco had won five of its last
six home games.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Tucker recorded his 16th double-double of the season with
12 points and 10 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzaga, which has been ranked a school-record 11 consecutive
weeks, is off to the best start in its 44 years as a Division I
member.</TE>

<TE>   Santa Clara 67, Loyola Marymount 59--Freshman forward Andy Osborn
had 18 points and eight rebounds to help the Lions mount two
second-half comeback attempts, but fell short, suffering their 10th
defeat in a row in front of 1,706 at Gersten Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara (13-13, 8-5) scored the last eight points of the first
half and 10 of the first 12 points of the second half to take its
largest lead of the game, 38-27.</TE>
<TE>   Loyola (9-18, 2-11) cut the 11-point deficit to one point with a
17-7 run to pull within 45-44 with 10:05 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos responded with the next seven points to push the lead
back to 52-44.</TE>
<TE>   With Santa Clara leading, 58-49, freshman guard Charles Brown, who
finished with nine points, sparked another rally that cut Loyola's
deficit to three twice in the last five minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lions pulled within 60-57 with 2:32 to play, but were forced
to foul down the stretch and Santa Clara made seven of eight free
throws in the final minute.</TE>

<HD>Lagat Enjoys Life in Fast Lane</HD>
<DH>Track and field: Kenyan, who will compete in today's L.A.
Invitational, is among the world's best in the 1,500.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bernard Lagat is a master at running fast in big races.</LD>
<LD>   It's winning that has proved elusive for the 27-year-old Kenyan,
who has yet to win a major race on the international level or
European circuit.</LD>
<LD>   Lagat, who is favored to win the men's mile for the fourth
consecutive time in the L.A. Invitational indoor track and field meet
at the Sports Arena today, became the second-fastest 1,500-meter
runner in history last August when he ran 3 minutes 26.34 seconds at
the Van Damme Memorial in Brussels.</LD>
<TE>   Lagat has broken 3:32 in the 1,500--equivalent to a 3:49 mile--on
11 occasions the past three seasons, but the 2000 Olympic bronze
medalist in the 1,500 placed second or third in each of those races.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, he's probably the master at finishing second in
extremely fast times," said James Li, Lagat's coach for the past 51/2
years. "But he probably needs to be a more diverse athlete who can
deal with a variety of races."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to knock Lagat.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington State graduate was the silver medalist in the 1,500
in the world championships in Edmonton, Canada, last summer and was
ranked fourth in the world in 1999, third in 2000 and second last
year. But he has been overshadowed by countryman Noah Ngeny and
Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj.</TE>
<TE>   "When you say, 'Noah' in Europe, people say, 'Ooooooh. That is the
Olympic champion,'" said the friendly, easy-going Lagat. "Or when you
mention El Guerrouj, they say, 'He's the world record-holder or the
world champion.'"</TE>
<TE>   Lagat lacks those titles, but the resident of Pullman, Wash.,
appears capable of attaining them in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   His best in the 1,500 is only .34 seconds off the world record set
by three-time world champion El Guerrouj in 1998, and he has improved
steadily since running 3:34.48 that year.</TE>
<TE>   "He is such a late bloomer and relatively inexperienced when it
comes to racing at the highest level," said Li, the cross-country
coach at Washington State. "So there is still a lot of room for
improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Li began working with Lagat in the fall of 1996 when Lagat
enrolled at Washington State on an athletic scholarship, but it took
a year for them to produce noteworthy results.</TE>
<TE>   Lagat, known as Kip to those around him, was sidelined because of
a tendon injury in his left knee for much of the 1996 cross-country
season and his best of 3:41.19 in the 1,500 during the 1997 track
season was well off the 3:37.7 he ran in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it took us a year to get to know each other," Li said.</TE>
<TE>   "It took a year for me to find out what he responded to best and
for him to understand what I expected of him."</TE>
<TE>   After his first-year struggles at Washington State, Lagat placed
third in the 1997 NCAA cross-country championships.</TE>
<TE>   He placed second in the 3,000 and anchored the Cougars' distance
medley relay team to a world-best time in the 1998 NCAA indoor
championships before finishing eighth in the 1,500 in the outdoor
meet after he was inadvertently tripped late in the race.</TE>
<TE>   The disappointment of that race eased later that summer when he
ran 3:34.48 to finish sixth in a meet in Stuttgart, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't tell you how hard it was," Lagat said with a laugh.
"During the race, I couldn't even breathe because the guys were
running so fast.... The last 100 [meters] seemed like it was 400."</TE>
<TE>   Lagat's performance ranked him 26th on the 1998 world list and
made him realize that he had to make some changes if he wanted to
become one of the world's elite.</TE>
<TE>   First, he needed to alter his running mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   His long, flowing stride was beautiful to watch, but a shorter
stride with a quicker turnover was required to excel in the
fast-paced 1,500.</TE>
<TE>   Second, he needed to work on his mental preparation for running
against 1,500 and mile titans such as El Guerrouj and Noureddine
Morceli of Algeria.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a tendency to be in awe of them because they were so fast,"
Lagat said.</TE>
<TE>   Lagat won a combined three NCAA titles during the 1999 indoor and
outdoor track seasons. But he wasn't considered among the top 1,500
runners in the world until August of that year when he ran 3:30.61
and 3:30.56 in consecutive races in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Those performances were nearly four seconds faster than his
previous best and gave him his first victories against 1996 Olympic
champion Morceli.</TE>
<TE>   "Monaco was a big meet for me because I beat Morceli for the first
time and broke 3:31 for the first time," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lagat got an equally big thrill a week later in Zurich when
Morceli approached him before his 3:30.56 clocking and told him that
he had a "very, very good future."</TE>
<TE>   Morceli, the top-ranked 1,500 and mile runner in the world from
1990-96, knew what he was talking about.</TE>
<TE>   Lagat lowered his 1,500 best to 3:28.51 in 2000--after giving up
his final year of collegiate eligibility so he could run
professionally--and to 3:26.34 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Lagat has run the two fastest indoor mile times of his career this
year at 3:55.07 and 3:55.16.</TE>

<LD>   Anything is possible, but this one smells different. There is a
definite whiff of desperation in the air, a botched and bungled
season that might be beyond repair.</LD>
<TE>   Senior forward Matt Barnes, who scored 38 points in two games
against Stanford last season, was suspended by the Pacific 10
Conference for today's game. Barnes pushed California guard Shantay
Legans so hard with 2:44 to play Thursday that Legans hit his head on
the floor and was unconscious for two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford was ranked No. 1 the last two times the teams met here,
making the UCLA victories colossal achievements. But the Bruins have
so many deeply ingrained problems and so few players performing well
that stealing another victory at Maples Pavilion seems implausible.</TE>
<TE>   With three regular-season games and the conference tournament
remaining, a better bet is that No. 25 UCLA (17-9, 9-6) will have
fewer than 20 victories entering the NCAA tournament. The Bruins play
host to first-place Oregon and struggling Oregon State next week.</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Stanford (17-7, 10-5), which concludes the regular season
with a visit to No. 14 Arizona and Arizona State, is also searching
for answers after crumbling in the second half and losing by 19
points to USC on Thursday. It was Stanford's worst home loss in nine
years.</TE>
<TE>   There is no overconfidence among the Cardinal, no taking UCLA for
granted.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to come back with energy, with cohesiveness, and fight a
little," Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said. "We're going to have to
dig down and find out what we're made of."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Bruins awoke Friday, looked in the mirror and
barely recognized themselves. Who were those guys mustering a measly
18 points in the first half and 51 overall against Cal?</TE>
<TE>   Familiar problems--spotty point-guard play, leaky defense, lack of
leadership--were joined by alarming new ones--poor perimeter shooting
by Jason Kapono and Billy Knight, bickering among Bruins after
several of their season-high 22 turnovers, and the angry, ugly
forearm thrown by Barnes.</TE>
<TE>   Referee David Hall, who called a flagrant foul and ejected Barnes,
told Pac-10 officials Friday the player was ejected for fighting,
prompting the suspension.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to hurt [Legans], and I lost sleep over it,"
Barnes said. "I couldn't sleep until 4 a.m. because I know I'm going
to hurt my team [by not playing today]."</TE>
<TE>   The only Bruin who has helped recently is Dan Gadzuric, who has
strung together three consecutive strong performances. Everyone else
is struggling, and some players are pointing to Gadzuric's increased
involvement in the offense as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told to get Dan the ball inside," Knight said, explaining
why he took only six shots against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Steve Lavin also has urged players to avoid hurrying shots,
make the extra pass and whittle down the shot clock. Sound advice,
but it isn't working either. Kapono and Knight are passing up open
looks and the offense is thrown into panic mode when the shot clock
ticks under 10 seconds because the playmaking ability of point guards
Cedric Bozeman and Ryan Walcott is lacking.</TE>
<TE>   "We are thinking too much before we shoot, making passes when we
are wide open," Barnes said. "We're making a concerted effort to get
the ball to Dan and that's worked for him. But we can't over-pass.
We've got to shoot too and help Dan out."</TE>
<TE>   Barnes, of course, won't be making any passes or shots today.
Sophomore T.J. Cummings will start in his place and Lavin said
freshman Andre Patterson will get more playing time than usual.</TE>
<TE>   "The main issue is that Matt realizes he shouldn't have let
emotions get the better of him and he shouldn't have retaliated the
way he did," Lavin said. "That part is inexcusable."</TE>
<TE>   However, the on-court quibbling is pardonable to Lavin, who
interprets it as leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "I've encouraged the older guys to, when necessary, get us
organized," he said. "I'm glad the players were a little salty. It
shows they are emotionally engaged and involved.</TE>
<TE>   "It was encouraging in the second half, we played with an edge and
were frustrated. Now it has to be channeled into playing more
efficient, better basketball."</TE>
<TE>   And should the Bruins do so, they believe it's not too late to
salvage the season.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say I'm worried," Lavin said. "We are discouraged, but I
still really like this basketball team. In the second half of the
season, we've beat USC and Arizona, two teams we lost to in the first
half of league. We've shown the ability to beat anybody. That's what
keeps the hope alive that we can do something special."</TE>
<TE>   Last season's 79-73 victory at Stanford qualified as
extraordinary. So did the 94-93 overtime victory two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But these Cardinal players are not resting on any laurels, not
after the Trojans ran away from them in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine we'll see a determined, fired-up and focused Stanford
team," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The question is whether Stanford will see the same in UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Bibby Gambles on Long Shots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>Henry Bibby played the percentages against California last time and
got burned.</LD>
<LD>   The USC coach is a stubborn sort, though, and again plans on
having a laissez-faire  attitude when the Golden Bears, who rank
eighth in the Pacific 10 Conference in three-point shooting
percentage, spot up from long range today at Haas Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   "You want them to shoot three-pointers, if you go with the
percentages," Bibby said. "We can't give them any open looks, that's
the thing. We have to be aware of them shooting the basketball
outside but more aware of them getting the ball inside and getting
the easier baskets.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd rather see them make three-pointers than get inside and make
a 10-footer because the percentages are in our favor with them
shooting threes."</TE>
<TE>   It seems to make sense.</TE>
<TE>   But while the Golden Bears may make only 32.8% of their shots from
beyond the arc in conference games, USC is ninth in the league in
defending the three-pointer, with its opponents making 38.9% of their
three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, California buried a school-record 15 three-point baskets in
its 92-91 overtime victory against the Trojans at the Sports Arena on
Jan. 24.</TE>
<TE>   A Brian Wethers turnaround three-point basket from deep in the
right corner tied the score at the end of regulation before Shantay
Legans made a 26-footer from the left wing for the victory just
before the buzzer at the end of the extra period.</TE>
<TE>   That loss is one of three this season the Trojans have endured
courtesy of a last-second three-point basket.</TE>
<TE>   Still, No. 20 USC (19-6 overall, 11-4 in the Pac-10) is in a
first-place tie with Oregon after the Trojans' dominating 77-58
victory at No. 10 Stanford on Thursday night, a road win that may be
the biggest in Bibby's six-year coaching career at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Think he's feeling the pressure? Bibby shut down access to his
players Friday, the first time he's done that all season.</TE>
<TE>   But the Trojans have insisted this week that they are already
focused, not only on today's game against the Golden Bears (19-6,
10-5), but on winning their first Pac-10 title since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   David Bluthenthal, who has busted out of his season-long slump by
averaging 24.6 points in his last three games with 13 three-point
baskets, said the Trojans are trying to win out.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Clancy, with his nation-leading 11 consecutive double-doubles,
said that with every passing game, the next one becomes the most
important of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Granville, who is shooting only 23.8% from the field the
past three games but has 23 assists and two turnovers in that span,
said the Trojans are beginning to get that same look and feel of
confidence they exuded last spring. USC advanced to the Elite Eight
before falling to eventual national champion Duke.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby has long called the three seniors the cornerstone of his
program. But only now, with three regular-season games left in their
college careers, are they all beginning to show up on a nightly
basis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about throwing egos out the window and the guy
that's hot, let's get him the basketball," Bibby said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they see the reward of what they can get by playing
together and playing as a team. I think they smell victory. It seems
like there's a sense of urgency."</TE>
<TE>   As well as a need to play the percentages.</TE>

<HD>Politically Savvy Chico Tepid on GOP Primary</HD>
<DH>Election: Three trying for governor's seat are overlooked
as local races are the talk of the town.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICO</DL>
<LD>This is a town with politics on its mind.</LD>
<LD>   The lawns of Chico are checkered with signs for a particularly
intense state Senate contest, a rematch between the sheriff and his
challenger from four years ago, and a local redistricting measure. It
is a political season that has sparked plenty of chat at Cory's cafe
downtown, where a septet of 70- and 80-somethings gathers weekday
mornings to down coffee and chew over the great events of the day.</LD>
<LD>   There's only one political issue that has escaped their
notice--the biggest contest in the state, the three-way Republican
gubernatorial primary on March 5.</LD>
<TE>   "None of the Republicans has been able to capture the interests of
the people," said Royce Delmatier, 78, a former top aide to Gov. Pat
Brown and past chair of the political science department at Cal State
Chico.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody even discusses it," said former CSU Chico administrator
and Republican Mac Martin, 81.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the weeks of appearances and millions of dollars in
advertising, the governor's race remains a distant thing, even in
this surprisingly political college and agricultural community of
60,000 that lies 90 minutes north of the state capital.</TE>
<TE>   What voters in Chico have gleaned of the increasingly heated
contest is its sheer nastiness--something that makes them less
inclined to pay attention and demonstrates the perils facing the
targets and flingers of mud--particularly incumbent Gov. Gray Davis
and former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "All they're doing is putting negative ads out," Margaret
Cruikshank said of Riordan and Davis. "You don't want to vote for
either one of them. There must be somebody else out there."</TE>
<TE>   And there is, Cruikshank concluded while eating frozen yogurt with
her granddaughter in the Chico Mall: Los Angeles businessman Bill
Simon. Simon shied away from attack ads until Thursday, relying
instead on spots featuring himself and his onetime boss in the New
York U.S. attorney's office, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been on television and talked about what he wants to do for
the state," Cruikshank said of Simon. "Now there's someone I can vote
for."</TE>
<TE>   Davis has unleashed an unusual onslaught of negative ads against
Riordan, even before Republicans choose their nominee.</TE>
<TE>   The governor hopes to either knock Riordan out of the primary or
weaken his support before what many expect would be a bruising
general election.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy seems to be working in Chico, where many voters had
never heard of the two-term Los Angeles mayor until his grainy
photograph began to appear in the governor's negative television
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   "The one from L.A., I don't know anything about him," said Bea
Earl, 68. "I just don't like the looks of him."</TE>
<TE>   Chico was never Riordan country. People here still talk about
seceding from the southern half of the state, and Los Angeles is
about as popular as a French ice skating judge.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything ends up going down that way and we sit up here,
watching it go--funds, water, everything," said Joe Smith, 36, who
owns a bicycle shop and growled "big-city politics" when Riordan's
name was mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the former mayor has no backing in Chico.
"There's a lot of people who are looking for a winner," said Josh
Cook, a political consultant and chair of the GOP in Butte County,
where Chico is located.</TE>
<TE>   Cook should know. Though he's backing Secretary of State Bill
Jones in the primary, his father, the mayor of nearby Gridley, chairs
the local Riordan organization.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anyone dominating up here," Cook said. "There's
support for each one of them and people have their reasons. If it's
Riordan it's because people want a winner. If it's Simon, he's the
most conservative. If it's Jones, he's good for agriculture."</TE>
<TE>   But Cook said that the particularly conservative makeup of Chico's
Republicans makes it tougher for Riordan, who is pitching himself as
an abortion rights and pro-gun control moderate.</TE>
<TE>   Those conservatives are counterbalanced by a surprisingly intense
liberal clutch of Chico residents, primarily the university's
students, faculty and graduates.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, people still talk about the packed crowd at a Ralph Nader
rally during the 2000 presidential campaign. "It's pretty far left
and pretty far right," said Ted Fulmer, a moderate Democrat who, with
his wife, owns two downtown restaurants that double as political
hangouts.</TE>
<TE>   The concrete ribbon of California 99 bisects Chico, splintering
off into business-lined boulevards in downtown. Coming from the
south, there are rice fields and signs touting Republican candidates
for the Legislature. Turn into downtown and new signs appear on the
windows of cafes and secondhand music shops--"Hate-Free Zone" and
neon peace symbols.</TE>
<TE>   Though the surrounding area is bedrock Republican--the
assemblyman, state senator and House member representing Chico and
its environs are all from the GOP--the city is constantly torn by
battles between Democrats and Republicans, developers and
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, voters stopped the widening of an access road that
could have brought more industry into town.</TE>
<TE>   The hot item on the March ballot is an effort to overturn the
redistricting plan of the conservative county Board of Supervisors
that undermines the seat held by Jane Dolan, a Democrat who happens
to be married to the political director of the state party, Bob
Mulholland.</TE>
<TE>   "The local races are really charged up, so that seems to have
taken attention away from the governor's race," said Dan Herbert, a
local real estate agent and Chico's mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert appeared unannounced at a brief Simon campaign stop this
week to endorse the neophyte candidate. Herbert was swayed by Simon's
performance at the third GOP debate earlier this month, where the
businessman declared himself a conservative and rebutted the
assertion that his anti-abortion stance would be interpreted as
anti-children.</TE>
<TE>   "I was impressed by the integrity of his position and the strength
of his position," Herbert said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon appears to have become the conservative alternative to
Riordan in Chico, muscling out his less-funded rival, Secretary of
State Jones, who as a Fresno rancher should appeal to the
agricultural communities of Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Still, impressions of Simon remain faint.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect the way Rudy Giuliani handled the whole 9/11 tragedy,"
said April Hicks, 27. "So I'll probably vote for the man he
[Giuliani] endorsed--Dick Simon."</TE>
<TE>   Hicks, a mother of three and video store manager, had only vague
impressions of the man whose name she conflated with Simon--Riordan.
She said she thought crime went up when he was mayor of Los
Angeles--a charge made in a Davis attack ad.</TE>
<TE>   Told that actually crime dropped under Riordan, Hicks was
skeptical. "It's hard to tell what's true and what's not, being so
far away," she said, asking why Riordan did not answer the attack if
it was false.</TE>
<TE>   But Davis' attacks can sometimes backfire. Cal State Chico speech
pathology professor Patrick McCaffrey saw a spot Thursday morning
accusing Riordan of shifting his position on abortion. "Just about
every point on there against him was positive," McCaffrey said. "He
changed his mind. That shows he's someone who thinks."</TE>
<TE>   Interviews in Chico reveal other perils for Davis. Butte County is
36.5% Democrat, but Davis won 46% of the vote here in 1998. He may
have a difficult time doing that again, according to interviews with
Republicans and independents who say they have soured on the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to vote for Gray Davis again," said Richard
Mathews, a 42-year-old cook and father of two. He, like many, cites
the governor's handling of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "As the governor, he's responsible," Mathews said. "It's terrible,
a family like mine, I have to pay over $300 a month in utility
bills."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the anger at Davis, the folks who gather to talk politics
at Cory's say that for now they consider him a shoo-in for
reelection. Both Democrats and Republicans at the table--and even a
self-proclaimed socialist and anarchist--said the governor was
clearly the favorite in November.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis has a lock on that one," said Charles Alexander, a
74-year-old Republican stalwart, citing the incumbent's wealth of
campaign funds.</TE>
<TE>   When the subject of the governor's race was brought up by a
visitor this week, the Cory's crowd shook off its indifference and
launched into a political round-table discussion that would have made
the McLaughlin Group proud.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that Riordan and Simon's personal wealth would be of
limited help because California has never taken kindly to
self-financed races--though they cautioned that much can change in
the next nine months.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' tenacity may be part of the tepid response for the
Republican primary candidates, the group concluded. Since they figure
Davis will win, who wants to spend time mulling over his possible
rivals?</TE>
<TE>   Another factor is geography, said John Sutthoff, a 76-year-old
retired journalism professor. Citing the Los Angeles roots of Simon
and Riordan, he said, "no one really speaks for the agriculture.
They're all speaking to the industries."</TE>
<TE>   "What about Jones?" asked Ned Kirkham, 82, a retired bank vice
president.</TE>
<TE>   The table agreed: The fact that no one had thought of Jones spoke
volumes about his struggling campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm leaning toward Jones," Kirkham insisted, citing the secretary
of state's Central Valley roots and experience in Sacramento. "He's a
Valley person. He understands Valley issues."</TE>
<TE>   Sutthoff said he favored Simon--even though he thinks the
businessman, who has stressed his conservative credentials, has scant
chance of besting Davis among the more moderate general electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has argued that, as a moderate, he has the best chance of
beating the governor. But Sutthoff said that argument has limited
appeal, especially given the difficulty in beating the incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think Republicans are motivated on who can beat Davis,"
he said, "as much as on who represents the world as they think it
should be."</TE>

<HD>Neighbor Held in Girl's Disappearance</HD>
<DH>Crime: DNA-tested blood evidence is 'strong,' police chief
says. Suspect reportedly had steam-cleaned his RV.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>A neighbor of a girl who has been missing for three weeks was
arrested Friday after a DNA analysis concluded that the blood found
on the man's clothing and in his motor home was that of the
7-year-old, police said.</LD>
<LD>   As he left his lawyer's office Friday morning, David Westerfield,
49, was arrested on suspicion of kidnapping Danielle van Dam, who has
been missing from her Sabre Springs home since Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   She was last seen by her father when he put her to bed about 10:30
p.m. Her parents, Damon and Brenda van Dam, discovered she was gone
the next morning.</LD>
<TE>   At a news conference, Police Chief David Bejarano said there is no
new information on the girl's whereabouts and police have no motive
for the alleged kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   DNA analysis of the blood lifted from Westerfield's clothing and
motor home is Danielle's and links him to the missing girl, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't stress enough how strong this link is," Bejarano said.
"We believe, without a question, that the DNA evidence links
Westerfield to the disappearance of Danielle."</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, an engineer, lives two doors from the van Dams in the
neighborhood that is about 20 miles north of downtown San Diego. The
divorced father of two lives alone.</TE>
<TE>   He has no criminal record, but Bejarano said detectives found
child pornography during a search of his home, for which he may face
additional charges.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield's attorney, Steve Feldman, could not be reached.</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano said he was holding out hope for Danielle's safe return,
but he said that did not appear likely.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Westerfield drove his motor home to a desert area east
of San Diego on the night that Danielle was last seen by her family.
Later, he drove to a beach park near Coronado, police said. Both
areas have been searched by police and volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the investigation said Westerfield
attracted police attention because of the excessive cleaning he gave
his recreational vehicle upon returning from the desert.</TE>
<TE>   He said Westerfield steam-cleaned the RV, using so much bleach
that detectives found the chlorine fumes overpowering when they
searched it Monday, two days after the girl was reported missing.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Westerfield took the cushions to be dry-cleaned, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield also gave conflicting accounts of his whereabouts at
the time that Danielle could have been abducted, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference outside their home Friday morning, the van
Dams said they were relieved to learn of Westerfield's arrest and
were anxious to find their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy that the police have made an arrest," Brenda
van Dam said. "But the fact still remains we don't have our daughter
back."</TE>
<TE>   Damon van Dam said supporters are organizing another search this
weekend in the Imperial County desert and in the hills around the van
Dam home. The couple also have two sons.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators questioned Westerfield two days after the girl's
disappearance and was under 24-hour surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   He allowed police to search his home without a warrant at least
twice, and detectives have questioned him several times.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have returned to the Westerfield and van Dam homes
numerous times.</TE>
<TE>   Police are analyzing fingerprints taken from Danielle's bedroom
but have not matched them to Westerfield.</TE>
<TE>   During the week, investigators returned to the van Dam home and
took away two doors as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Some neighbors described Westerfield as someone they waved to but
knew little about.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just one of those neighbors you waved to. I've lived here
three years and don't know anything about him," said Joe McBrien.</TE>
<TE>   Another neighbor, who wanted to be identified only as Rahul and
lives one house over from Westerfield, said his neighbor was "a
marvelous landscaper."</TE>
<TE>   "He never gave me a reason to suspect he was a bad fellow," the
neighbor said.</TE>

<HD>Guard Troops to Be Assigned to Mexican Border</HD>
<DH>Defense: Deployment is meant to boost security. Critics
question the use of soldiers for domestic law enforcement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities next month will send about 300 National Guard troops
to bolster security at California's border with Mexico, despite the
reservations of state Guard officials who say the arrangement may
violate a law barring U.S. armed forces from domestic law
enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   The deployment is part of a six-month initiative that will send
1,600 Guard troops under federal control to the Mexican and Canadian
borders. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the soldiers were
sought by the three U.S. agencies primarily responsible for guarding
the border: the Customs Service, Immigration and Naturalization
Service and Border Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   "They'll be doing some cargo inspection, monitoring of crowds,
possible crowd control if needed, and other activities which are
deemed appropriate for the military," said Pentagon spokesman Maj.
Mike Halbig.</LD>
<TE>   At a time when the Guard is assuming a bigger security role at
airports and other facilities, the border plan has stirred fresh
debate over the appropriate use of soldiers on U.S. soil. Although
California National Guard personnel under state control for years
have built border fences and helped federal inspectors hunt for
smuggled narcotics, the Pentagon discontinued military anti-drug
patrols after the fatal shooting by a Marine of a teenage goatherd in
Texas in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The latest debate centers on a decision to place the troops, who
normally serve under the states' governors, under federal command
during their stint on the border. It has taken months to work out
details of the deployment, the costs of which will be picked up by
the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon ruled that the troops will operate under the
supervision of the three federal border agencies they are assigned to
help. "We were asked to give federal assistance on federal borders by
federal agencies," Halbig said.</TE>
<TE>   Precise duties are still being worked out. Pentagon officials said
the troops would not be armed, though a National Guard official in
California said some would be.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials said they have no intention of allowing Guard
members to act as police--or to turn the border into an armed camp.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want to militarize the border. That is not our desire,"
Halbig said.</TE>
<TE>   "The law of the land is still the law of the land, and we still
respect that," he added. "We won't be putting our people in positions
where they have to arrest or apprehend."</TE>
<TE>   However, the mere deployment of troops on the border under
federal, rather than state, command might violate the Posse Comitatus
Act barring U.S. forces from domestic law enforcement work, said Maj.
Gen. Paul D. Monroe, who commands the 22,000-member California
National Guard.</TE>
<TE>   The 1878 law, crafted to curtail the use of Army soldiers in law
enforcement after the Civil War, forbids the military  from engaging
in police activities "except in cases or under circumstances
expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress." It does
not apply to National Guard troops under state control.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe said he and other officials from border states favored
deploying the troops under state command, using federal funding as
provided for under Title 32 of the U.S. Code. Monroe said that
arrangement would avoid potential legal questions surrounding the use
of soldiers for law enforcement on U.S. soil.</TE>
<TE>   He expressed concern that Guard members could be exposed to
lawsuits stemming from their border duties if they are found to be
working in violation of the Posse Comitatus law. "It's very risky for
our people. Most of our people are good soldiers, and they're going
to do what they're asked to do," Monroe said.</TE>
<TE>   The military's role in domestic security has prompted new
discussion since the terrorist attacks, which to many blurred
distinctions between crime and warfare. Sen. John Warner, a Virginia
Republican, has proposed that the Posse Comitatus doctrine be
reexamined in light of the recent events.</TE>
<TE>   "The world has dramatically changed; our way of life has forever
changed. Should this law now be changed to enable our active-duty
military to more fully join other domestic assets in this war against
terrorism?" Warner wrote to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in
October.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts say placing troops on the border is inappropriate
except under narrow circumstances or a national emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "As real as the terrorist threat is--and it is very real--we have
no dire, temporary emergency on our borders of the kind and quality
to warrant a constitutionally based use by the president of our
federal troops to enforce the civil law inside the United States,"
retired Brig. Gen. Joseph R. Barnes, a former ranking military law
specialist, wrote in a recent commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Others who have long decried the use of troops at the border said
the planned deployment represents a dangerous new militarization.
"This is setting a new level of the federal government on the border
that's not trained to deal with civilians," said Roberto Martinez, a
migrant rights activist.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she is
considering legislation to expand the role of the Guard in homeland
security. She also is willing to sit down with Defense officials and
California National Guard commanders to try to resolve misgivings
about federal control over troops on the border.</TE>
<TE>   The six-month duty is meant to give customs and the INS time to
hire and train more inspectors to ease the flow of traffic at
crossings, where stricter controls since Sept. 11 have led at times
to long delays, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll be used primarily to provide a heightened security
presence at all the locations--primarily at the ports of entry," said
Virginia Kice, an INS spokeswoman in Laguna Niguel. "It's not that
the Guard will be doing immigration enforcement. They won't. But
they'll be doing valuable support duties."</TE>
<TE>   The use of the National Guard at the border isn't new. California
Guard troops have helped inspectors on the Mexican border hunt for
illegal drugs for more than a decade, and have built border fences
and patrol roads. About 200 troops are assigned to aid the Border
Patrol in construction and help customs inspectors find and remove
drugs hidden in vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "They've acted as an extra set of eyes and hands, allowing
inspectors to be freed up to man the booths and the pre-primary
[inspection] areas," said Vince Bond, a customs spokesman in San
Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe said, however, that the Guard members on anti-drug duty
have worked under the governor's command, rather than that of the
federal government.</TE>
<TE>   The California troops are to be called up by March 4 and sent for
training at a military base in Washington state before reporting to
the border in mid-March.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Revives Amnesty Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge has breathed new life into one of the nation's
longest-running lawsuits, increasing the likelihood that thousands of
undocumented immigrants around the country will be able to become
lawful U.S. residents.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton in
Sacramento could end 16 years of legal limbo for the immigrants, many
of whom were rejected for residency under the 1986 federal amnesty
program because they had temporarily left the United States in
previous years.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a fantastic decision," said the plaintiffs' lead lawyer,
Peter A. Schey of the Los Angeles-based Center for Human Rights and
Constitutional Law. "It will open the door to tens of thousands" of
long-term undocumented immigrants to become legal residents.</LD>
<TE>   Schey said he would file a motion by March 4 seeking to
permanently bar the Immigration and Naturalization Service from
attempting to prevent thousands of immigrants covered by the legal
decision from applying for lawful permanent residency.</TE>
<TE>   An INS spokesman said the agency would have no comment until its
attorneys had thoroughly reviewed the ruling, which Karlton filed
without fanfare Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit stemmed from the INS' response to the 1986 Immigration
Reform and Control Act, which was designed to allow more than 3
million formerly illegal immigrants--including 1.6 million California
residents--to emerge from the shadow world of the undocumented.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, originally filed that year, alleged that up to 350,000
immigrants were illegally disqualified by the INS from applying for
the amnesty program offered in the reform law. Individuals who were
granted amnesty gained legal entitlement to work permits and became
eligible for lawful residency--and eventual citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1986, the case has bounced back and forth among Karlton's
court, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco and the
U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   In a November 2000 ruling, 9th Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher
likened the protracted litigation to a Russian novel, saying it had
"a long and unhappy history."</TE>
<TE>   But Schey said he thinks the immigrants may now be on the verge of
overcoming "a war of attrition" waged against them by the INS.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a case in which we are trying to legalize a large
population of immigrants based on far-out legal theories. This is a
case in which we have fought to enforce the law as written by
Congress, and the INS has engaged in vexatious litigation to avoid
its obligations under federal law," Schey said.</TE>
<TE>   In order to qualify for amnesty under the 1986 law, the immigrants
were required to show that they had maintained continuous U.S.
residence from 1982 to May 4, 1988, when the application period
closed, but brief absences were permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Congress said it wanted any interpretation of the program to be
"generous."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, the law said that the immigrants could have had
"brief, casual and innocent" absences abroad and still be eligible
for the program.</TE>
<TE>   When the INS issued its regulations to implement the law, however,
the agency disqualified any illegal immigrant who had left the
country without INS permission--about 250,000 people--during the
relevant period.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those were people who had left the U.S. to visit relatives
in Mexico or Central America and then returned.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the regulations were published, the nationwide-class
action suit was filed in Sacramento challenging the INS rules.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of applicants for amnesty were rejected by the INS after
filing formal applications because of their temporary absences. In
addition, thousands of other applicants who had left the U.S.
temporarily were rejected by INS clerks without even being permitted
to file an application. And thousands of other immigrants never even
applied after they heard the INS was denying amnesty to anyone who
had left the country temporarily, Schey said.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1988, Karlton issued his first major ruling in the case.
He said the INS regulations were inconsistent with the plain language
of the 1986 law. He issued an order extending the period immigrants
could apply for amnesty until November 30, 1988.</TE>
<TE>   About 20,000 to 30,000 immigrants who had already submitted
complete paperwork were then accepted by the INS, according to
attorney Carlos Holguin, Schey's co-counsel.</TE>
<TE>   However, the INS appealed, and the extended application period
never went into effect for the other plaintiffs.</TE>
<TE>   The immigrants won a number of court battles in the case over the
next eight years, and thousands garnered temporary work permits. But
the INS continued to appeal, and the ultimate outcome remained in
doubt.</TE>
<TE>   While an INS appeal of a 9th Circuit ruling was pending, Congress
passed the tough Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996. Among other things, the act said federal
courts no longer had jurisdiction over issues involved in this case
and two related lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Schey then filed a new-class action suit and Karlton once again
issued an injunction against the INS and granted temporary work
permits and temporary protection from deportation for about 50,000
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge panel of 9th Circuit judges, however, ruled 2-1 in
1998 that Karlton no longer had jurisdiction over the suit. He
reluctantly dismissed it, and thousands of immigrants lost their
temporary work permits.</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, a larger panel of 9th Circuit judges, led by
Fletcher, reversed the decision of the three-judge panel.</TE>
<TE>   The court majority said that a large group of immigrants could
continue to challenge an INS ruling that they were ineligible for the
1986 amnesty program and that another group of immigrants--including
thousands of children--could challenge the agency's actions, even
though they filed suit long after the six-year statute of limitations
had run out.</TE>
<TE>   Just a month later, Congress enacted the Legal Immigration and
Family Equity Act Amendments of 2000, known as the LIFE Act. Among
the benefits the law conferred was temporary restoration of the
long-expired 1986 law permitting certain illegal immigrants to become
lawful permanent residents of the U.S. It also voided the
court-stripping provisions of the 1996 law. Schey then amended the
lawsuit for the eighth time, leading to this month's ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling by Karlton means that people who were rebuffed by
clerks at INS, or who can show that INS actions were a substantial
cause of their failing to apply for amnesty, are eligible to apply
for residency under the 1986 law or the 2000 LIFE Act.</TE>
<TE>   It is easier to qualify under the 1986 law, but people who are
accepted under the 2000 law can become permanent residents more
rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Karlton's ruling also allows thousands of other individuals who
never applied for a work permit to go to trial to contend that they
have been denied equal protection of the law under the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution. Those individuals are not eligible to apply for
permanent residency under the LIFE Act because they never applied for
a work permit--something many of them had no reason to do because
they were children.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes no sense to penalize kids who had no control over this,"
Holguin said.</TE>

<LD>Ansel Adams was a craftsman, artist, visionary, teacher,
conservationist, mountaineer, jovial raconteur and the nation's
premier landscape photographer. He is receiving a new burst of
attention as the exhibit, "Ansel Adams at 100," tours the the U.S.
and Europe on the centennial of Adams' birth Feb. 20, 1902. A
companion book of the same title has been published by Little, Brown
and Co.</LD>
<LD>   Many of the photos are familiar: the crashing waters of Yosemite
Falls, the brooding visage of Half Dome, a shimmering Mt. McKinley,
"Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico" and a winter dawn blushing Mt.
Whitney. A few are not so well known. And some side-by-side prints
show how Adams' printing style progressed.</LD>
<LD>   But always they are striking images, most of them from his beloved
Sierra Nevada and Yosemite Valley, from sharp rugged granite to the
velvet of a dogwood blossom. Adams raised nature photography to an
art, and he inspired a whole generation of photographers after
opening his first workshop in Yosemite in the 1930s and establishing
the department of photography at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York in 1940.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Adams served 37 years as a director of the Sierra Club
and lobbied extensively--and successfully--for greater protection for
the national parks. A Yosemite peak and a nearby wilderness area are
named for him. Americans, and particularly Californians, are the
richer for his work. Adams died in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   A new generation of Americans and Europeans can become acquainted
with Adams' genius. The Adams show already has been to San Francisco.
It will be at the Art Institute of Chicago Feb. 20-June 2, the
Hayward Gallery in London July 4-Sept. 22, Kunstbibliothek in Berlin
Oct. 10-Jan. 5, 2003, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art Feb.
2-April 27, 2003, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York July
9-Nov. 4, 2003.</TE>

<LD>Thanks a lot, Judge Greene.</LD>
<LD>   He was the well-meaning, earnest fellow who, in 1984, decided the
nation couldn't live with one telephone company. His decisions
implemented AT&amp;T's breakup but seemed to unleash a cascade of
theoretically beneficial competition, confronting millions of
innocent Americans with a compounding surfeit of overwhelming daily
decisions.</LD>
<LD>   You can now blow an entire Saturday deciding stuff.</LD>
<TE>   We used to have it simple--a number for the phone, Social Security
and license plate. We survived on one species of M&amp;Ms and two choices
about toilet paper, rolling off the top or the bottom depending on
maternal tradition. But now, what phone company for local service?
What company for long distance? DSL? Unlisted? Messaging? Forwarding?
Call waiting? Line insurance? What Internet company? By the hour or
unlimited? Cable TV or satellite? Which satellite? Which movie
package? Which news channel--the one with Larry King in suspenders or
the one with short skirts? You know going in that no packages
compare. Same for cell phones. How to figure if the 7 p.m. minutes
plan is better? How many are out of state? Or region? What region? Do
you want a vanity auto license? Also, decide right now: If you die on
the 101, can some strangers have your organs?</TE>
<TE>   Once, passwords were only for childhood clubhouses. Now, grown-ups
need one at work. "Your password expires in four days. Do you want to
change it?" Aging minds must choose--numbers, letters, capitals?--how
to jumble old passwords to remember new ones without psychiatric
care? Same for PINs. Is this ATM worth $2 or wait for the free one
near home? $40, $60, $80? Which PIN is it--birthday or anniversary?
Need checks? What style?</TE>
<TE>   Movies used to show one film; 17 now playing. At the grocery
store, brand name or generic? Grande or venti? How many apple
varieties do we really need? Sodium-free crackers? Reduced fat? Even
Cheerios require decisions now. And then: Paper or plastic? Lottery
ticket? Club member? Four ways to pay. Need help to your car? Gas
low? Several grades to pick. Pay inside or out? Credit or cash? Want
a receipt? Car wash? Tire treatment? Wax? Need a snack? Is drive-thru
always slower than walk-in? Regular or diet? Supersize? What sauce?
Here or to go? Cold in the car? What fan speed and where to
blow--windshield, mid-level, floor or combo? Same for passenger side?
Now, about your sprinkler settings....</TE>
<TE>   As for Harold Greene, he retired, then died two years ago of a
cerebral hemorrhage. May his selection of heavenly golf courses and
plaid pants be many.</TE>

<HD>Snowmobile War Redux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Snowmobiles don't belong in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national
parks, no matter how much the Department of the Interior wants to
appease snowmobile manufacturers and related businesses. The winter
fastness of these parks should be as inviolable as in the wilderness
of Yosemite National Park, where the roaring, polluting machines
never have been allowed.</LD>
<LD>   The National Park Service has completed still another study of
snowmobile use in the parks and come up with little or no new
information. Now the Park Service is seeking yet more public comment
before deciding in November whether to implement a ban that was
scheduled to begin with the winter of 2003-04.</LD>
<LD>   The last time the Park Service requested comment, two years ago,
more than 80% of the thousands who responded supported the ban. This
time, the snowmobile industry may be better at drumming up support,
but ordinary citizens still can make themselves heard.</LD>
<TE>   Area leaders are concerned the ban will hurt the local economy,
especially that of West Yellowstone, Mont., a major entry point for
snowmobilers. But the new study says that any of the alternatives
will produce less than a 1% decline in jobs and business dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department ordered the new study as part of its
friendly settlement of a lawsuit brought by snowmobile manufacturers
and the states of Montana and Wyoming to overturn the ban, which was
instituted by the Clinton administration. The ban was approved in
November 2000 after more than a decade of study of the harm done by
snowmobile pollution and noise on the park environment.</TE>
<TE>   Snowmobile makers insist that their new four-stroke engines are
quieter and less polluting than the old models. That's true. But even
the new machines disrupt wildlife and threaten public safety and the
enjoyment of other park visitors.</TE>
<TE>   The new study offers four alternatives: Retain the ban beginning
in 2003-04; delay the ban until 2004-05; impose a daily cap on
snowmobiles and phase in new noise and air quality standards; permit
only guided touring on machines driven by Park Service personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The logical choice is to stick with the ban the Park Service has
planned all along.</TE>
<TE>   The Park Service has started tours to Old Faithful, the most
popular snowmobile destination, by snow coach, although the coaches
themselves are reported to be pretty noisy. The service, with
Congress' help, should develop quieter coaches and expand the fleet
to handle the demand for those who truly want to visit Yellowstone in
winter. These include cross-country skiers and snowshoers hoping not
to be chased from their trails and out of their solitude by a
snarling snow machine.</TE>
<TE>   As for the snowmobilers, who talk about the thrill of the wind in
their faces, they can get all the wind they want in the millions of
acres of national forest lands that surround the parks.</TE>

<HD>Prop. 45 Said to Favor Democrats</HD>
<DH>Politics: Critics of the initiative to ease term limits say
GOP incumbents would face a tougher time circulating petitions for
extra terms because of higher turnout rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Proposition 45, an initiative to tweak California's strict
term-limits law, would heavily favor Democratic incumbents over
Republicans seeking to extend their tenure in the state Legislature,
GOP leaders say.</LD>
<LD>   The measure on the March 5 ballot would allow lawmakers to seek
four more years in office if they can gather the signatures of 20% of
the voters who cast ballots in prior elections. But because voter
turnout is significantly higher in GOP-controlled districts, on
average, most Republican incumbents would face a more significant
hurdle.</LD>
<LD>   "It is clearly a Democrat plan, one-sided and designed to skirt
the term-limit law," California GOP Chairman Shawn Steel said.</LD>
<TE>   The term-limits initiative approved by voters in 1990 restricts
Assembly members to three two-year terms and state senators to two
four-year terms. Proposition 45 would permit senators to serve a
third four-year term, and Assembly members to serve two more two-year
terms, so long as they gather enough signatures and win at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republican incumbents assume they would be able to meet the
signature requirement, even though they would have a tougher
threshold than Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   And some critics of Proposition 45 blame Republican lawmakers,
many of whom dislike term limits, for dissuading the party from
spending any money to defeat the initiative, a contention that some
party leaders dispute. Still, though the GOP opposes Proposition 45,
the party has spent no money to defeat it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are financially challenged," Steel said, adding that with
Democrats holding most statewide offices, the GOP in California
struggles for money.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have it."</TE>
<TE>   The California Democratic Party, by contrast, is the largest donor
to the Yes-on-45 campaign, contributing $3.2 million of the roughly
$10 million raised by the initiative's proponents. With Democrats
already holding 50 of 80 seats in the Assembly and 26 of 40 Senate
seats, the initiative could help solidify Democrats' hold on the
Legislature, simply because of the difficulty of unseating
incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   The turnout-based signature requirement is an additional, more
subtle, burden, Republicans contend.</TE>
<TE>   If Proposition 45 had been in place this year, Assembly Democrats
would have needed to gather an average of 22,965 valid signatures to
win the right to run for two more two-year terms. Republicans would
have needed an average of 29,577 signatures. State senators, whose
districts are twice the size of Assembly seats, would have to gather
roughly twice as many signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Karin Caves, spokeswoman for the Yes-on-45 campaign, called the
turnout issue "completely inconsequential" and said the initiative is
simply aimed at granting voters the right to reelect legislators who
represent them well.</TE>
<TE>   "Legislators doing a good job will have a good chance of gathering
signatures," Caves said. "The difference is marginal. There is no
Democratic advantage. Republicans eligible for an extension will
stand just as good a chance as Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Republicans represent five of the six Assembly districts
where turnout was highest in the 2000 election, and 12 of the 20
highest-turnout districts. Democrats control the 19 seats with the
lowest turnout two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   At the low end, outgoing Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, a Democrat who
represents downtown Los Angeles, would have needed a mere 7,626
signatures, or 20% of the 38,130 voters who cast ballots in his
district in the 2000 election.</TE>
<TE>   At the high end is Assemblyman Tim Leslie, a Republican who
represents a sprawling district that includes Tahoe City and where
216,336 voters cast ballots two years ago. He would have needed
43,267 signatures to meet the 20% hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the difference is that though each lawmaker
represents about 423,000 people, Cedillo's district, like those held
by many urban Democrats, is home to a large number of recent
immigrants who are not citizens and cannot vote.</TE>
<TE>   No fan of California's strict term-limits law, Leslie extended his
legislative career by returning to the lower house after serving two
senate terms. But though he might support a more direct ballot
measure asking voters to extend lawmakers' tenures by another term or
two, Leslie called Proposition 45 a "Democrat-dreamed-up scheme ...
to maintain incumbent Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   To obtain the necessary signatures, candidates could use
volunteers or hire firms that specialize in circulating petitions.
Either way, there is a cost. Firms that mount statewide initiative
petition drives charge at least $1 per signature, and often far more.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles) assumes that
signatures would cost $3 to $5 each. If Proposition 45's provisions
were in place now, Wright would need to gather 11,885 valid
signatures for a fourth term, based on his district's turnout in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   If Wright's cost estimate is accurate, the price tag would be
$35,600 to $59,400.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of Proposition 45 say campaign contribution caps imposed
by an initiative approved in 2000 would apply to candidates' petition
drives. Opponents doubt that the limits would apply.</TE>
<TE>   But if they did, and individuals could give no more than $3,000 to
a candidate's effort, Wright assumes that his replacement would need
to tap about 20 donors to pay for the petition drive. That is not an
insurmountable hurdle for any lawmaker.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just that much more money you need," said Wright, who spent
about $150,000 on his last campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The obstacle is much greater in many Republican-controlled
districts. At $5 per signature, Leslie could be looking at a cost of
$216,000, roughly double what he has in his campaign account. The
state senator representing that area would have to gather twice that
number of signatures to qualify for a third four-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The task is complicated because Leslie's district, like many held
by Republicans, covers a vast area with few population centers. Sen.
Rico Oller (R-San Andreas), whose district runs from near Bishop to
the Oregon border and is larger than West Virginia, would have to
gather about 75,000 signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Oller called the task "virtually impossible."</TE>
<TE>   "Just think of the logistics: You'd have to go to Alturas, Mammoth
Lakes, Roseville, Angel's Camp, Chico," Oller said. "It's an abuse of
Republicans."</TE>

<LD>Foes of the initiative to ease California's term limits law are being
outspent 10 to 1, but they have one advantage over the initiative's
supporters: They haven't revealed the identities of contributors who
have spent $1 million to defeat the measure.</LD>
<LD>   And because of loopholes in campaign laws, they evidently don't
need to do so.</LD>
<LD>   The No-on-45 campaign received $1.03 million on Valentine's Day
from a group called Americans for Limited Terms, located in Spring
Green, Wis. But the identities of the group's individual donors are
cloaked thanks to a combination of state and federal laws that shield
the contributors to nonprofit organizations.</LD>
<TE>   "There is a loophole in disclosure laws that allows nonprofits to
contribute to campaigns without disclosing to the public where they
raise their funds," said Alfie Charles, spokesman for Secretary of
State Bill Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "It is another piece of the complex campaign finance laws that
needs to be resolved so voters know who is giving how much to whom,"
Charles said.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Joseph Remcho, who specializes in political law, noted
that state law says political organizations must disclose who
bankrolls them if they donate for or against candidates or ballot
measures--but only if they know in advance that their money will be
used for a political campaign. So if the group gives a second time to
the effort to defeat Proposition 45, its donors likely would become
public.</TE>
<TE>   "They may very well not have to disclose under the current state
of the law," said Remcho, who has done work for the pro-45 campaign.
"That is repulsive to everything we've tried to do in California."</TE>
<TE>   Americans for Limited Terms' donors also are protected under
federal law, which allows financial backers of issue-oriented
activities, including the attack on Proposition 45, to remain
anonymous. And state and federal tax laws do not require public
disclosure of donors to nonprofit corporations, including those that
engage in political activities.</TE>
<TE>   California lawmakers could pass a statute requiring that such
groups disclose their donors. Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
(D-San Francisco), a major proponent of Proposition 45, said he may
propose such legislation. However, pointing to U.S. Supreme Court
decisions that permit nonprofit corporations to keep their donors
secret, Remcho called it "an open question" whether such a state law
could pass constitutional scrutiny in a court test.</TE>
<TE>   Eric O'Keefe, president of Americans for Limited Terms, described
his financial backers as "idealistic supporters of term limits," who
have little or no business before the California Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be confusing for us to list donors who have no axes to
grind," O'Keefe said.</TE>

<HD>Davis Shifts on MTBE to Avert Crisis</HD>
<DH>Politics: Governor seeks to avoid a switch to a pricier
ethanol fuel additive in election year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN  and DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' announcement Thursday that he may delay banning the
pollutant MTBE from gasoline reflects an election year gamble that it
is better to risk the ire of environmentalists than a big run-up in
gasoline prices.</LD>
<LD>   More specifically, Davis is trying to avert a second energy
crisis--one that could hit late this year, about the time voters
decide whether to give the Democratic governor a second term.</LD>
<LD>   And if a consultant's report warning this week of prolonged
gasoline shortages and price spikes proves true, most Californians
would feel the impact directly, unlike last year's electricity
shortage that resulted in half a dozen blackouts and never hit Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   In one of his most high-profile decisions, Davis in March 1999
said he was banning MTBE from gasoline as of this coming December.
The additive is a health hazard that may cause cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Davis ordered the ban after MTBE was shown to be seeping from
under gas stations and other oil facilities across the state,
tainting public drinking water supplies from Santa Monica to Lake
Tahoe.</TE>
<TE>   Added to gasoline to reduce air pollution, MTBE turned out to be
an insidious water pollutant. Water officials continue to discover
new contamination sites. Just last month, officials announced that a
plume of tainted ground water has moved close to a well that produces
drinking water for 17,000 homes in Rialto, Fontana, Colton and
Bloomington.</TE>
<TE>   A study commissioned by Santa Monica and several other cities
estimated that it could cost at least $29 billion to remove MTBE from
soil and water supplies nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The governor's decision to ban MTBE was cheered widely by
environmentalists, who represent an important part of his support
base.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Davis turned to the Bush administration seeking
an exemption from a federal Clean Air Act requirement that states add
so-called oxygenates--such as MTBE and ethanol--to gasoline.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rejected the request last
June. It did so even though Davis and oil company representatives
contended that a new formulation of gasoline would soon allow
California to meet clean air requirements without oxygenates.</TE>
<TE>   Without an exemption from the EPA, the state's oil refiners,
facing a ban on MTBE, would be forced to use ethanol, the only other
practical oxygenate.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor based his decision to ban MTBE on science," Davis
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said. "Now, we're being forced to
take into account the economic consequences of the Bush
administration's failure to grant us the waiver."</TE>
<TE>   Salazar added that he believes environmentalists will "understand
the situation we find ourselves in."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, some environmentalists did express some understanding for
Davis' predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody has agreed to support [a delay in the
ban]," said V. John White, a Sacramento lobbyist who works on
environmentalist issues. "But there is a degree of sympathy for the
circumstances he finds himself in. The governor is going to do what
he does on the delay, and some people will criticize him."</TE>
<TE>   Others were less charitable, saying that by delaying the ban on a
drinking water contaminant, Davis would be putting oil company
interests ahead of public health.</TE>
<TE>   "Drinking water is California's most important resource. MTBE is
very quickly destroying that resource," said Richard Drury, legal
director of Communities for a Better Environment, an environmental
group that sued 14 oil companies to force them to clean up sites
contaminated by MTBE.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' announcement that he might delay the ban came after a
report issued Tuesday warned that the ban could cause fuel shortages
and drive up prices at the pump to as high as $3 a gallon.</TE>
<TE>   Ordered by the state Energy Commission, the report was prepared by
Stillwater Associates, an Irvine-based firm that specializes in oil
industry issues. The study recommends that the ban be delayed until
the end of 2005, and says the phase-out of MTBE could cost California
consumers $1 billion to $3 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   The specifications for California gasoline are so
strict--especially for the kind needed to blend with ethanol--that
refiners outside the state are hard pressed to produce it, said David
Hackett, president of Stillwater. The firm also found that the state
lacks capacity to store imported gasoline and ethanol.</TE>
<TE>   Prices could be further forced up because the physical makeup of
ethanol makes it impossible to ship through normal petroleum
pipelines, Hackett said. Rather, it must be mixed in special tanks at
distribution terminals, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists question the report.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen a government report come out that is so clearly
biased in favor of the refinery industry," Drury said. "It is
basically a wholesale attack on environmental regulations."</TE>
<TE>   Others claim that Davis may be turning his back on ethanol, which
they call a clean, renewable resource that can be produced in
California. "What is surprising to me is how hard Gov. Davis is
working to give multinational oil companies 100% market share while
totally ignoring a $1-billion grass-roots agricultural industry here
in California, ready to produce a clean, renewable fuel," said Tom
Koehler of Kinergy Resources, an ethanol development company, and a
member of the California Renewable Fuels Partnership.</TE>
<TE>   However, there has been little investment in ethanol production in
California. The state's conversion to ethanol was slowed by the Davis
administration's effort to get a waiver from federal officials that
would have exempted the state from using such oxygenates.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, to tamp down protests, the Davis administration has been
meeting with selected environmentalists, including some of MTBE's
fiercest critics in the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   The governor knows he runs the risk of losing some support among
environmentalists if he delays the ban. But the governor also is
sending a message to Midwestern ethanol producers that so long as
California continues using MTBE in its gasoline, they won't win the
lucrative California market.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be held hostage to another energy cartel," a
top Davis administration official said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The official noted that only a handful of companies, led by Archer
Daniels Midland, based in Decatur, Ill., control 80% of the nation's
ethanol production.</TE>
<TE>   Presidential politics also play a part in what amounts to a trial
balloon by Davis, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle of South
Dakota is carrying energy legislation that includes a requirement
that states use ethanol. He is considered a potential presidential
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   The ethanol rule might cheer Iowa corn growers, but a doubling of
gas prices would have the opposite effect in California with its 58
electoral votes, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is pushing Daschle to exempt her
state from the ethanol requirement, something Davis dearly wants. But
on Friday, Feinstein suggested she was having a hard time persuading
Daschle.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have been told is the proposal by Sen. Daschle could
result in the doubling of the cost of gasoline," Feinstein said in
her statement. "Clearly, that is untenable for California and it
leaves Gov. Davis little choice."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein said she and Davis "are trying to do everything we can
to avoid" a delay on the MTBE ban.</TE>

<HD>Delays in Release of Detained Youths Decried</HD>
<DH>Protest: Amnesty International talks of minors held after
judges have ordered them released. County says it has addressed the
issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amnesty International, in a letter this week to Los Angeles County
supervisors, expressed "serious concern" about allegations that
minors as young as 13 have been held for weeks at Juvenile Hall
despite court orders that they be freed.</LD>
<LD>   "Whether the failure to ensure the prompt release of these
children was due to lack of adequate procedures, resources, training
or oversight, or whether it is due to negligence or design, Amnesty
International urges that these allegations be taken seriously," wrote
Susan Lee, a director of the London-based human rights group.</LD>
<LD>   The unusual correspondence was sent to Board of Supervisors
Chairman Zev Yaroslavsky on Wednesday, one week after a class-action
lawsuit was filed on behalf of 19 minors who, the suit alleges, were
wrongfully incarcerated after judges ordered their release.</LD>
<TE>   In an interview Friday, Yaroslavsky said county officials were
examining the issue of improper detention of youths months before the
lawsuit was filed.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, he said, officials adopted new regulations that
mandate the immediate release of children once a judge has ordered
them freed.</TE>
<TE>   "We did have a problem, and the county was well aware of the
problem," Yaroslavsky said. "It was a bureaucratic mess."</TE>
<TE>   Under the new regulations, he said, juveniles ordered released by
a judge are to be freed by 4 p.m. the day of the court order. If they
are still in custody after that time, Yaroslavsky said, probation
officials are to escort the youths to the Department of Social
Services to ensure that they are transferred to a non-jail setting.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I know, the new protocol has worked as intended,"
Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   "And we don't believe we have had any over-detentions" since the
new policy took effect.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Sanford Jossen, who filed the class-action lawsuit,
praised county officials for "acknowledging the problem ... and
taking action to correct it."</TE>
<TE>   But Jossen said he would still pursue the lawsuit, adding that as
recently as Thursday he was contacted by another teenager who alleged
that he had been illegally detained.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue still remains that there were a significant number of
kids who fell victim to this problem, and they deserve to be
compensated," Jossen said. "And I see nothing wrong with asking a
court to look at this problem and ensure it has been addressed."</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleges that illegal detentions sometimes occurred
because of a "lack of coordination and cooperation" between the
Department of Children and Family Services and the Probation
Department. In other cases, according to the lawsuit, children's
department employees decided to hold teenagers despite court orders
that they be released back to foster care.</TE>
<TE>   "The inappropriate, excessive or unlawful incarceration of
children, such as has been alleged in these cases, is a matter of
serious concern not only because liberty is a fundamental human right
but because incarceration has inherent risks to the physical and
mental integrity of children," Amnesty International's Lee wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Freer, a researcher at the organization's Los Angeles office,
said Friday that the decision to contact county officials about the
issue represents a "fairly rare" step by the group.</TE>
<TE>   Although it has examined allegations of police brutality in Los
Angeles and ill treatment of incarcerated juveniles elsewhere in the
nation, the letter was the first to be written on the topic of
illegally detaining youths beyond their scheduled release dates in
the United States, Freer said.</TE>

<HD>5.7 Quake in Baja California Felt Across the Border</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A moderately strong 5.7 magnitude earthquake in Baja California
rocked most of Imperial and San Diego counties at 11:32 a.m. Friday,
Caltech seismologists reported.</LD>
<LD>   The quake was centered about 29 miles southeast of the border city
of Calexico near the site of an 1892 quake that measured 7.0.</LD>
<LD>   Although occupants of high-rise buildings in San Diego felt a
rolling motion, no injuries and only slight damage were reported on
the American side of the border--mostly goods falling off shelves in
Calexico stores. Damage south of Mexicali was described as moderate
by Mexican authorities.</LD>
<TE>   In El Centro, deputies briefly evacuated the sheriff's office,
according to reports from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   The quake was followed by 13 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or more,
the strongest a 4.1 at 12:33 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The area affected is south of California's Imperial Valley and is
one of the most seismically active in the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   Major quakes rocked the Imperial Valley in 1940 and 1979.</TE>
<TE>   A map issued late Friday by the U.S. Geological Survey showed that
strong shaking from the latest temblor occurred in the Imperial
Valley as far north as Brawley, nearly 30 miles from the border.</TE>
<TE>   The region near the epicenter of Friday's quake has shown some
signs of volcanic activity in the distant past, and there is
geothermal power development both there and across the border in the
Imperial Valley.</TE>

<HD>A People's Pope: How 'Il Papa Buono' Humanized the Papacy</HD>
<DH>"POPE JOHN XXII" by Thomas Cahill Penguin, 237 pages,
$19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On March, 15, 1953, the tenderhearted son of Lombardy tenant farmers,
portly and a bit squat, stood before the people of Venice. He spoke
to them as their new cardinal, but his words foreshadowed the makings
of a radical future pope.</LD>
<LD>   "I have an inclination to love people, which keeps me faithful to
the law of the Gospel and respectful of my own rights and the rights
of others. It stops me from doing harm to anyone; it encourages me to
do good to all," Angelo Roncalli told the crowd. "I commend to your
kindness someone who simply wants to be your brother, kind,
approachable and understanding."</LD>
<LD>   The world could have no better brother than the "fat, lovable
little bishop," biographer Thomas Cahill writes in "Pope John XXIII":
"Here at last was a pope as a pope ought to be."</LD>
<TE>   Here was a pope who felt most comfortable among the citizenry; who
as a relatively lowly bishop in Turkey wheedled and begged to help
save as many as tens of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust; who
reached out to people of sundry religions and cultures and who, never
believing in his own papal infallibility, sought the wisdom of
others. A pope who was august in deeds, if not in looks.</TE>
<TE>   Cahill does more than present us with a biography of a beloved
pope who served only five years, from 1958 until his death at 81 in
1963. The author also provides context for understanding why this
pope was dubbed il papa buono (the good pope) by his people. He
chronicles the history of the papacy, presenting Roncalli as a kind
of descendant of those greatly humane popes who all too infrequently
did right by the papacy: popes who did not forget that the first step
in being Christlike was loving their fellow human beings.</TE>
<TE>   Cahill, whose previous books range in topics from the early
biblical Jews to the Irish contribution to civilization, writes
passionately and deeply here. His love of John XXIII is rooted in his
disappointment that so many popes over so many centuries squandered
so many opportunities. His joy in those popes he considers benevolent
is equally palpable, approaching a glow. As the author illustrates,
good popes have been far outnumbered by middling to awful ones. Men
of cruelty, violence and insecurities warred with kings. They
subjugated lives. They built pleasure palaces. They created that
cynical torture assembly line, the Inquisition.</TE>
<TE>   "Inconvenient popes," Cahill writes, "were dispatched mafia-style
or left to live on as terrifying examples, minus eyes, lips, tongue,
hands--or, in the case of one, all the above."</TE>
<TE>   Pope Stephen VI (896-97) had the corpse of his predecessor,
Formosus, exhumed, seated at a trial, convicted, then thrown into the
"green sludge" of the River Tiber. One pope, Boniface V--"rumored to
be an atheist and insatiable pederast"--so inflamed the great poet
Dante that the writer gave him an especially hot place in hell when
he wrote his "Inferno."</TE>
<TE>   The popes Cahill praises demonstrated a love of humanity, an
inherent kindness, tolerance, concern for the poor and a lack of
monarchical delusions. Angelo Roncalli also demonstrated a sense of
humor and a tendency not too take himself too seriously. He came from
a humble family with a streak of social awareness. Cahill illustrates
the pope's earthiness by describing the visit of First Lady
Jacqueline Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "He had been advised to address her as 'Mrs. Kennedy' or, if he
preferred, as 'Madame,' since they would speak French together. But
when he saw the beautiful young woman striding toward him, he opened
his arms and exclaimed, 'Jackie!'"</TE>
<TE>   Unlike previous popes, Roncalli did not see non-Catholics,
especially Jews, as "faithless" or blind, Cahill writes. He simply
saw them as "separated brethren" to be loved equally. On his first
Christmas as pope, he changed a harsh prayer that referred to the
"faithless Jews." His new text read: "Let us pray also for the Jews
to whom God our Lord first spoke. May he keep them in fidelity to his
covenant and in the love of his Name, so that they may reach the goal
to which his will wishes to lead them."</TE>
<TE>   John XXIII and his immediate predecessor, the austere, imperious
Pius XII, were both shaped by the question of what they did to help
the Jews during World War II. Both men are candidates for sainthood,
yet Pius' ascension would certainly evoke anger and controversy
because of the belief among many that he did not do enough to oppose
Hitler's "final solution." Pius, writes Cahill, did more than he has
been credited for in many circles, using his personal resources to
"ransom" Jews and directing Italian churches, monasteries and
convents to give asylum to many. Pius' great error, according to
Cahill, was putting "too much reliance on silent diplomacy and not
enough on the power of his position as a mouthpiece of morality."</TE>
<TE>   What Pius could not convey was what Cahill describes as John
XXIII's "aura of goodness." As John lay dying, soon to be succeeded
by Pope Paul VI, he was read messages from all over the world, from
the rich and the poor, "from Christians and Jews, from Buddhists and
atheists."</TE>
<TE>   One atheist wrote: "Insofar as an atheist can pray, I'm praying
for you."</TE>
<TE>   The pope, writes Cahill, smiled.</TE>

<LD>The former finance manager of the Gunderson Chevrolet dealership in
El Monte was sentenced Friday to three months in jail and five years'
probation for conspiring to defraud customers.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Albert Fisher, 54, is expected to be allowed to serve the
jail term through an electronic monitoring program, the district
attorney's office said.</LD>
<LD>   Fisher was one of seven former Gunderson employees indicted in May
on charges that they hid extra charges in sales contracts.</LD>
<TE>   The dealership did not admit any liability when it entered into a
multimillion-dollar settlement in April.</TE>
<TE>   The dealership's former general manager, James Michael Hoban, and
five other former employees are awaiting trial in Los Angeles
Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   As a condition of his guilty plea Nov. 27, Fisher agreed to
testify against his former co-workers, prosecutors said.</TE>

<HD>Candy With Lead Taken Off Shelves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousands of pieces of Tama Roca, a Mexican-made candy that contains
dangerous levels of lead, have been removed from 30 Long Beach
markets, and health officials Friday warned the public not to eat or
touch the product.</LD>
<LD>   "This candy is very popular with the Hispanic population," said
Ron Arias, director of the Long Beach Health and Human Services
Department, noting that Long Beach has 165,000 Latinos, according to
the 2000 Census.</LD>
<LD>   "To find lead in a candy product is alarming," Arias said. "It's a
hazard more usually found in paint. It has severe consequences. We
found people in the city manager's office [who] had Tama Roca in
their desks."</LD>
<TE>   Lead is toxic to humans, particularly infants, young children and
pregnant women, in both short- and long-term exposures. It can damage
the central nervous system, resulting in learning disabilities,
behavior disorders and "other problems that could last a lifetime,"
said Felix Aguilar, Long Beach's public health physician.</TE>
<TE>   Those who suspect exposure should seek a blood test or may call
(562) 570-4203.</TE>
<TE>   Also Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced
recalls of Asian-made gel candies that have caused six American
children to fatally choke. The recalls by Hanmi Inc. and Hocean Inc.,
both of California, and New York-based Mon Chong Loong Trading Corp.
bring to at least 18 the number of recalls of conjac jelly candy,
also known as konjac, konnyakku or yam flour.</TE>
<TE>   The sticky candy is sold under dozens of brand names and often
comes with an embedded piece of fruit that doesn't easily dissolve.
Recalled were Hanmi's Conjac Coconut Jelly; Hocean's Jelly Cups, also
sold under the names Great Western Foods, New Choice and Fuji; and
Mon Chong Loong's My Love brand, lychee flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Tama Roca is among several candies--many containing
tamarind--identified by the state as containing high lead levels.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach health inspectors were visiting a Mexican meat market
in the city when they spotted the brightly wrapped candy. Tests later
revealed lead in the wrappers and in some candy.</TE>
<TE>   Tama Roca, which is soft and dark brown, comes on a stick or as
individually wrapped pieces.</TE>

October. Some of the group's 1,490 members threatened to leave over
what they perceived as Pederson's desire to change the organization's
mission, which has traditionally been to take stands on a mix of
spiritual and political issues.</LD>
<LD>   In a Jan. 5 interview with the Star Tribune of Minneapolis,
Pederson said, "Sometimes, in taking our stands we've allowed
ourselves to be typecast, and the effectiveness spiritually has been
diminished."</LD>

<LD>A leading church Latinist warned this week that with the study of
Latin dying out, Roman Catholics are in danger of losing their
identity.</LD>
<LD>   "Today there are priests who don't even know how to read the
inscriptions on tombs in their churches," the Rev. Biagio Amata said.</LD>
<LD>   Amata, dean of the Pontificium Institutum Altioris Latinitatis, a
Salesian institution, known in English as the Pontifical Institute of
Higher Latin Studies, spoke at a symposium marking the 40th
anniversary of Veterum Sapientia, the apostolic constitution
reaffirming the importance of Latin in seminarians' curricula.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>NEW YORK--The Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches has ranked
the Mormon Church among the nation's five largest religious bodies
for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The ranking may be debated, however, because the yearbook does not
take into account the nation's largest black denomination, the
National Baptist Convention, U.S.A. Inc., which did not report its
membership. The listing also omits Judaism and Islam, sizable faiths
that don't provide membership figures for synagogues and mosques.</LD>
<LD>   The Mormon Church, formally known as the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, reported 5,208,827 U.S. members, moving past the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (5,125,919 members).</LD>

<HD>Christie's Former Wife Claims Grand Jury Bias</HD>
<DH>Court: Ex-spouse of the Hells Angels leader moves for
dismissal of her drug indictment, saying the Ventura County panel was
disproportionately male.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ex-wife of Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. is asking a
judge to set aside a massive drug-and-racketeering indictment,
arguing that the grand jury that charged her was too male-dominated.</LD>
<LD>   Cheryl Christie, a 54-year-old Ventura resident, argues the
indictment is invalid because Ventura County's grand jury selection
process is constitutionally flawed.</LD>
<LD>   "The importance of a representative grand jury to the fair
administration of justice cannot be overstated," her attorney, Kay
Duffy, wrote in a motion filed late Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Her challenge comes three weeks after a Santa Barbara judge found
the same grand jury lacked women and was not reflective of the
Ventura County population.</TE>
<TE>   In that ruling, Superior Court Judge Frank Ochoa found that the
grand jury pool did not represent a fair cross-section of the
community as required by state and federal laws.</TE>
<TE>   Ochoa found that while women constituted 51.1% of the
jury-eligible population, they represented only 26.5% of the grand
jury pool.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, he set aside the indictment of murder suspect Michael
Schultz, who is accused of raping and strangling a Port Hueneme woman
in 1993. Schultz has since been rearrested and is awaiting
arraignment on murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy refers directly to the Schultz case in her motion and argues
that the same problems exist in her client's case.</TE>
<TE>   She further requests that the case be assigned to Ochoa for a
hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the ruling on the same issue," Duffy said Friday, "it
behooves us to follow suit."</TE>
<TE>   Christie has pleaded not guilty to 18 criminal counts, including
conspiracy, drug possession and filing false tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   She is one of 27 defendants, including her ex-husband and
25-year-old son, indicted last year following a four-year
investigation into alleged drug sales by Hells Angels members to high
school students in Ventura and Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   At least one other defendant is expected to piggy-back on her
motion. A hearing is set for March 11.</TE>

<LD>The reclusive founder of a worldwide network of charities was ordered
held without bond Friday on an extradition warrant from Denmark,
where he has been charged with looting millions of dollars from one
of his nonprofit organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Mogens Amdi Petersen, 63, who has lived in seclusion for more than
20 years, was declared to be a "serious flight risk" after a lengthy
hearing before U.S. Magistrate Stephen J. Hillman in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Petersen was arrested last weekend during a stopover at Los
Angeles International Airport on a flight from Britain to Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Danish prosecutors have accused him of tax fraud and embezzling
about $10 million from a branch of the Tvind organization, which he
established during the 1970s to educate troubled youths in Denmark.
Since then, the organization has expanded to Africa, Asia, Latin
America and the United States, combining philanthropic work with
business ventures that include plantations, factories and
used-clothing stores.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen attracted hordes of idealistic volunteers who surrendered
their Danish government-subsidized salaries to Tvind for the
privilege of participating in the movement.</TE>
<TE>   Accused by some critics of operating a cult-like organization,
Peterson left his native Denmark about 1980 and went into seclusion,
according to Danish authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, he had been living in secret in a $10-million
condominium on Fisher Island, a private retreat off the South Florida
coast.</TE>
<TE>   Poul Gade, a Danish prosecutor dispatched to Los Angeles this
week, said some of the money Petersen allegedly extorted went to pay
for the condo as well as other personal luxuries.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Petersen's lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, argued that his
client was a "philanthropist not a fugitive."</TE>
<TE>   Shapiro offered to produce testimonials from an assortment of
African leaders attesting to the work of Petersen's volunteers in
running schools and combating AIDS and in public works projects.</TE>
<TE>   He said American friends of Petersen were prepared to post a
$1-million bond to secure his release.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Matthew E. Sloan countered that a $1-million
bond would not suffice to ensure Petersen's stay in the U.S. His
organization, Sloan told the judge, has assets worth more than $100
million and generates millions of dollars in revenue a year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, Sloan said, Danish investigators uncovered evidence that
Petersen recently applied for citizenship in Zimbabwe and Brazil,
which do not have extradition treaties with Denmark.</TE>
<TE>   Hillman set a March 19 date for a status conference on the case.
Afterward, the matter will be assigned to a U.S. District Court
judge, who will hold an extradition hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Petersen's arrest has drawn more than a dozen Danish journalists
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our Enron," one television reporter said outside the
courtroom Friday. "This guy has been a raging controversy for years.
He's front-page news everywhere in Denmark."</TE>

<DH>Champions: El Camino Real High honors its Academic
Decathlon, Envirothon teams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the pomp and circumstance usually reserved for athletes or for
soldiers returning from battle, El Camino Real High School in
Woodland Hills congratulated its Academic Decathlon team Friday for
winning its seventh consecutive district title.</LD>
<LD>   On a warm, sunny day, 3,400 students used their morning nutrition
break to applaud the nine decathletes, as well as members of the
Envirothon team, which recently won a regional science competition.</LD>
<LD>   The Academic Decathlon team won the Los Angeles Unified School
District competition on Wednesday and will go to the state contest
next month in Modesto. The school's two Envirothon teams placed first
and second in their regionals and will participate in the state
finals in April in Oakhurst. As the El Camino band blared and the
cheer team yelled, students threw down their Spanish and literature
books and watched the proceedings on the quad's grassy lawn.</LD>
<TE>   "Can we say seven in a row?" asked Assistant Principal Gloria
Morrison. The decathletes are not only seven-time district champs,
they also won the national contest last year and in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Spear, a 17-year-old senior, paused to cheer on the
academic competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "They get a lot of respect," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Spear's friend, Ilyse Blitz, 18, said the yearly rally lifts the
spirits of decathletes, and now Envirothon team members, as they hit
their books to prepare for the state competition. "It boosts up their
self-esteem and helps us win," Blitz said.</TE>
<TE>   In the Envirothon competition, students work together to answer
written questions and conduct hands-on projects on environmental
topics, such as forestry, wildlife and soils, said Coach Scott
Holloway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like real life," Holloway said. "They work in a team
situation."</TE>
<TE>   El Camino competed in the Envirothon regionals for the first time
last year, placing second, and went on to capture second place in the
statewide contest.</TE>
<TE>   In the Academic Decathlon, team members compete in 10 academic
subjects as individuals and their scores are combined to create a
team score.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for the decathlon events consumes many hours, and the
decathletes often devote seven hours a day, countless summer days and
Saturdays to studying. But the hard work leads to national prestige
and recognition for El Camino, said decathlete Ketti Augusztiny, 17.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what we're known for," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The decathletes said they appreciated Friday's rally because they
know many other schools and competitors do not receive as much
encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "Our program is so great because of the support of the teachers
and students," said decathlon team member Behnam Bozorgi, 17.
"They're the reason for our success."</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen teachers volunteered to help the students prepare
for competitions in categories such as art, economics and speech,
said Melinda Owens, one of El Camino's decathlon coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Although competitions are nerve-racking, 17-year-old decathlete
Adam Mann said he is looking forward to the state contest.</TE>
<TE>   "Bring it on," he said with a smile.</TE>

<HD>CHP Launches Campaign to Curb Accidents on 710</HD>
<DH>Traffic: The agency will use two federal grants to add
patrol units and educate truck and car drivers on the freight-heavy
roadway.</DH>

<LD>The California Highway Patrol has launched an effort to make the Long
Beach Freeway safer by adding more patrols and implementing an
education campaign to crack down on reckless truck drivers.</LD>
<LD>   One of the region's major freight corridors--leading to the ports
of Long Beach and Los Angeles--the roadway has been plagued by truck
accidents.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, a big rig punched through the freeway's weak center
divider and plowed into oncoming traffic, killing one and injuring
nine others.</LD>
<TE>   The Highway Patrol will use two federal grants to pay for the
program to curb the high number of accidents on the freeway, said CHP
Capt. Calvin Aubrey.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to take a proactive approach, rather than just
being reactive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The grants, which total more than $300,000, will be used for
enhanced patrol of the 24-mile roadway.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, seven CHP units patrol the Long Beach Freeway daily.
With the additional funding, four to five more units will be added,
Aubrey said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, CHP officers issued 3,062 citations to truck drivers on
the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The primary causes of truck-involved collisions are unsafe lane
changes, speeding, passing violations, driving under the influence of
alcohol or drugs and following too closely, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, there were 616 truck-involved collisions on the freeway,
a number that CHP officials hope to reduce.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the grant also will be spent on a driver awareness
campaign, which will include two billboards, one on each side of the
freeway, that will depict a truck and a car harmoniously sharing the
roadway.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want truck [drivers] to feel that we're out to get
them," Aubrey said, noting that car drivers also cause many
accidents. "This is not a case of CHP against truckers."</TE>
<TE>   "If a car quickly changes lanes in front of a truck, trucks can
weigh up to 80,000 pounds, and they can't stop as quickly as a car
can," Aubrey said.</TE>
<TE>   However, the larger part of the education campaign is aimed
specifically at truck drivers. CHP commercial vehicle specialists
will go to truck companies and make safety presentations for drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Transportation last year also began a
$400-million overhaul of the 46-year-old freeway, replacing
deteriorating pavement.</TE>
<TE>   Big rigs carrying cargo from the two ports account for more than
13% of the total traffic on the freeway. The original design assumed
that only 5% of the traffic would be trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Fixing the 710 had to be a partnership," said Sharon Weissman,
district director for Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach).
"With Caltrans doing the repaving project, education and enforcement
were the other two keys."</TE>

<HD>Father Arrested in Asphyxiations of His Children</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man suspected of lighting a grill inside his home is
moved to County-USC jail ward.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shortly after his release from a Whittier hospital Friday, a Pico
Rivera man was arrested for allegedly igniting a charcoal grill
inside his house that killed five of his six children while they
slept.</LD>
<LD>   Handcuffed and wearing a light blue hospital gown, Adair Garcia
was wheeled out of Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital and released
to sheriff's homicide investigators.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia, who had gone through two days of treatment for severe
carbon monoxide poisoning, was booked on five counts of first-degree
murder and one count of attempted murder. He is expected to be
arraigned as early as Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia, 30, was hospitalized after he and his children were found
unconscious in their home in the 9600 block of Washington Boulevard
on Wednesday morning by his mother-in-law, who was going to baby-sit.</TE>
<TE>   The night before, Garcia tucked his children into bed, lighted the
barbecue grill and allowed it to burn for hours, said Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Lt. Don Bear.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe that Garcia was depressed about his rocky
marriage. His wife, Adriana Arreola, had left the house for at least
a week before the killings, Bear said.</TE>
<TE>   Many, including neighbors, did not see any warning signs, and Bear
said his first glimpse of the house Wednesday did not suggest a
troubled family.</TE>
<TE>   Pictures of the smiling Garcia children are proudly displayed on
the living room walls. According to teachers, the children always had
great attendance, were well-dressed and well-groomed. Arreola often
attended school events.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you understand this?" Bear asked. "There really is no way
that you can understand this or why someone would do something like
this."</TE>
<TE>   But on Wednesday morning, in the small two-bedroom house, where
the children sometimes slept three to a bed, the middle-class
neighborhood woke up to a tragedy in its midst.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies arrived to find the entire family unconscious
from carbon monoxide fumes. Dead were Brenda, 10; Jonathan, 7; and
Anthony, 2. Cecilia, 4, died later that day. On Thursday, Vanessa, 6,
died of her injuries. Kassandra, 9, is expected to make a full
recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, a splicing technician with SBC Pacific Bell in Rosemead,
was found unconscious but alive near the grill. Doctors were able to
save his life by immediately getting him into a hyperbaric chamber.
He is now able to walk and talk, but has not shown any emotion,
hospital officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he was wheeled out of a side entrance to the hospital
Friday, Garcia had a blank, pale look on his face. While he was taken
away in a sheriff's squad car, at least five family members,
including his mother and father, waited in the hospital's critical
care unit.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know anything, we don't know anything," one family
member said as she rushed out of the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Before being booked, Garcia was to be reexamined in the jail ward
at County-USC Medical Center, Bear said. Once at the Men's Central
Jail, Garcia will be under a suicide watch and kept away from other
inmates for his own safety.</TE>
<TE>   Bear said investigators have been unable to fully question Garcia
or his wife, who has been so shaken that she has been unable to speak
to them.</TE>
<TE>   It has been difficult for everybody involved, especially residents
of Pico Rivera, where four members of another family were killed less
than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Flores, 39, and three of his children were stabbed to
death in the summer of 2000. Monica Diaz, Flores' adopted daughter,
and her boyfriend, Michael Naranjo, are on trial for the killings.</TE>
<TE>   The Flores home is half a mile from the Garcia residence. For some
residents, Wednesday's events brought back many of the same memories.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels almost the same way it did that night," said 62-year-old
Manuel Iglesias, a close friend of the Flores family, who stopped by
the Garcia house this week to light a votive candle on the porch.</TE>

<DH>Heat wave: Residents flock to pools and beaches as
unseasonably warm weather breaks temperature records.</DH>

<LD>Families frolicked on the beaches. Dads sneaked out of work early to
play a round of golf. And kids ran to swimming pools to splash in the
cool water.</LD>
<LD>   The calendar may say winter, but the temperature gauge in Southern
California is definitely pointing toward summer.</LD>
<LD>   In Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, the unseasonably warm
weather Friday broke temperature records, prompting sun-loving
Southern Californians to find any excuse to get outside.</LD>
<TE>   At a time of year when most people would be huddled inside to
avoid winter rains, dozens of mothers with young children flocked to
beaches with pails, shovels, and in at least one instance, borrowed
summer beach clothes.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco resident Ruth Wilford, visiting her stepmother in
Ventura with her daughter Jessica, said the warm weather caught her
by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "We packed all our cold-weather stuff," Wilford said as she sat on
a fold-up chair near Ventura Beach reading a paperback and wearing a
T-shirt and sandals borrowed from her stepmother, Marvis Gleerup.</TE>
<TE>   The warm weather broke records Friday in Yorba Linda, where the
mercury reached 91 degrees, surpassing the record of 85 in 1961.
Santa Ana recorded a high of 93 degrees, breaking its record of 87
set in 1995. Downtown Los Angeles reached 90 degrees, eclipsing the
previous record high of 86, set in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures in Chatsworth reached 90 degrees, edging out the
previous high of 88 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Ventura hit 85 degrees, breaking its record of 82 set
in 1990. Oxnard saw a high of 89, edging out its record of 87 in
1954. Simi Valley also hit 89, breaking its record of 86 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters predicted even more sunny weather over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "You're gonna stay hot for a bit," said Eric Edge, a forecaster
with Weather Central Inc., which provides forecasting services for
The Times. "You have yourselves a summer in wintertime."</TE>
<TE>   More summer weather will probably draw even more people outside in
the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait for the weekend," said Jon Mitchell, a lifeguard for Newport
Beach. "It's going to be packed."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, lifeguards, swimming pool attendants and golf pros
throughout the region reported unusually big crowds enjoying the
sunny weather.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it's a good crowd for a Friday and for this time of year,"
said Julia Martinez, an attendant at a hectic community pool in Boyle
Heights.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the temperature was in the high 80s Friday afternoon,
Sharon Hillenbrand of Northridge dressed her daughter Lucy, 4, in
boots and mittens.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy, who attends the Magic Years Nursery School in Reseda,
frolicked in a yard covered with snow. She carried snowballs in her
red mittens and rode down a snow-covered straw hill on a plastic
sled.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years the school has had 16 tons of snow delivered each
February. But on Friday, school officials didn't expect the weather
to feel like summer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best place to be when it's this hot outside,"
Hillenbrand said. "What a Southern California way to do it."</TE>

<HD>Davis Unveils New Addition to Area's Carpool Lane Network</HD>
<DH>Transportation: In Sherman Oaks, governor designates funds
for a northbound corridor on the San Diego Freeway that should open
in 2007.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Touting the success of a new carpool lane on the southbound San Diego
Freeway, Gov. Gray Davis announced Friday that he will allocate $90
million toward building another carpool lane for the freeway's
northbound drivers.</LD>
<LD>   The northbound lane, scheduled to open in 2007, will run between
the Santa Monica and Ventura freeways, one of the most congested
corridors in the state.</LD>
<LD>   The planned lane is part of a larger effort to double the number
of carpool lanes for all freeways in Los Angeles County by 2015,
officials said at a news conference in Sherman Oaks. Los Angeles
County currently has 396 miles of carpool lanes.</LD>
<TE>   "We're trying to spend money to speed people to work," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The 7.8-mile, $20.5-million southbound lane, which opened 11/2
months ago, is already saving the average user 18 minutes every ride,
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Across Los Angeles County, 51 miles of carpool lanes are now under
construction, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
which provided 90% of the money for the southbound San Diego Freeway
lane. The MTA also is helping to pay for another 301 miles of lanes
that are in the planning or design phases.</TE>
<TE>   In December, carpool lanes, or high-occupancy-vehicle lanes, are
scheduled to open on the Antelope Valley Freeway at the Foothill
Freeway, according to the MTA.</TE>
<TE>   By summer 2004, more carpool lanes will open on the Santa Monica
and San Diego freeways. Others in the works include carpool lanes for
the Golden State Freeway between the Antelope Valley and Ronald
Reagan freeways, and along the San Diego Freeway between the Santa
Monica Freeway and Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   All are part of a plan for a "total network" of carpool lanes
throughout Southern California, Caltrans Director Jeff Morales said.
Final costs for a northbound lane on the San Diego Freeway are not
yet known, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and other officials praised Caltrans for completing the
southbound lane five months ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans "shocked physicists around the country" for opening the
lane well before politicians got the chance to cut the ribbon for it,
quipped Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) at the Sherman Oaks
Galleria event, which was billed as the "official grand opening" of a
lane that has been in public use since Jan. 8.</TE>
<TE>   Because of their low usage in some spots, carpool lanes have
angered drivers on the regular, more congested lanes. Three years ago
New Jersey converted some carpool lanes back to regular use.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California's 24-hour carpool lanes, at odds with
rush-hour-only restrictions on Northern California freeways, also
have stirred resentment among drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "To have it vacant during non-rush hour is a waste of taxpayers'
money," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners
Assn. Close is trying to form a coalition of community groups to
lobby officials to open the San Diego Freeway carpool lane during
non-peak hours.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is reviewing its 24-hour restriction policy for Southern
California to determine what needs to be changed, Morales said.</TE>
<TE>   Most people in L.A. seem to like carpool lanes, according to the

believed a countywide carpool system should be completed. And 72%
agreed or strongly agreed that carpool lanes are more efficient than
regular lanes.</TE>

<HD>Jobless Rate in County Rises</HD>
<DH>Economy: About 4,300 positions have been lost since
November, but experts say the area is poised to rebound from the
national downturn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County unemployment rose sharply in January as lingering
effects of a national economic downturn prompted a decline in local
jobs for the second straight month.</LD>
<LD>   The number of local jobs had surged every month since 1996, but a
January drop of 3,400 positions meant that local employers have shed
4,300 workers since November, partly because of post-Christmas
layoffs, but also because of cutbacks in construction and education.</LD>
<LD>   The county's jobless rate increased from 5.0% in December to 5.4%
in January, compared with 6.7% in California and 6.3% nationwide,
without seasonal adjustments. That translates to 22,900 jobless
workers, the highest number for the month since 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a softness, and we'll probably have another four or five
weak months," said Bill Watkins, director of the Economic Forecast
Project at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a spate of indicators that the short U.S. recession may
already be over, Watkins said employment shifts traditionally trail
economic trends, falling last in a downturn and reviving only after
the economy is back on its feet.</TE>
<TE>   He cited a new round of layoffs at Boeing in Seal Beach, which
employs several local subcontractors, as a sign that the recovery is
still gathering steam. "We've had a 14-month decline in manufacturing
production [nationwide], and that's the longest since the
Depression," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Watkins and Mark Schniepp of the California Economic Forecast
said a resilient Ventura County economy is poised for a quick
rebound. Even now, jobs are up 7,600 from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The local economy is riding out the downturn better than the state
and nation, they said, because heavy manufacturing and Internet
businesses, the nation's weakest sectors, are not big employers in
the county.</TE>
<TE>   Local Economy Has Many Strengths</TE>
<TE>   "Ventura County is just an amazing place right now. We're still in
excellent shape," Watkins said. "We have some real strengths, and we
don't have the weaknesses other places have."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, the county has two military bases, which aren't
going to be cutting jobs now. And it also is a worldwide center of
the growing biochemical industry, led by Amgen and Baxter.</TE>
<TE>   Schniepp said he sees nothing in the new report that's alarming.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest job loss--1,700 positions in retail
businesses--regularly occurs in January, he said. Construction, in
which 700 jobs were lost, is always slowest in the winter. And
unemployment reports will be affected for months to come by the move
of Kinko's headquarters from Ventura to Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a moderate to weak jobs report," Schniepp said. "It does
show the continuing malaise. There's still some shedding that needs
to occur in the technology sector. But we're still well below the
[jobless] rate of the state and nation. And I expect the second
quarter to be much more buoyant."</TE>
<TE>   A developing trouble spot that could create problems for years to
come is government employment, Watkins said.</TE>
<TE>   The state's projected budget deficit of at least $12.5 billion has
already begun to trickle down to colleges, schools and local
governments, which are beginning to block new hiring. Education jobs
in the county fell by 700 last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a multiyear problem," Watkins said. "They've already
stopped hiring at the universities unless they have a very good
reason. And they'll pass the pain along to local governments too."</TE>

<HD>Chuck Jones, 89; Animation Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chuck Jones, the animator who helped give life to that wascally
wabbit, the portly pig, the lisping duck and the tormented coyote,
died Friday in his Corona del Mar home. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   The three-time Oscar winner, whose career spanned more than 60
years and involved the creation of more than 300 animated films, died
of congestive heart failure. His wife of 20 years, Marian, was at his
side.</LD>
<LD>   While he will always be remembered as the animator who helped
create Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Wile E. Coyote, among
many others, he most recently began to dedicate himself to fine art
drawing. His work has been exhibited at galleries and museums
worldwide, including a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in
New York City.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Jones considered his cartoon characters as real as any
subject he depicted in his museum pieces.</TE>
<TE>   "Animation isn't the illusion of life," he said in a biography on
his Internet page. "It is life."</TE>
<TE>   Jones' wife said Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and other characters all
represented a part of her husband and his fun-loving sense of humor.</TE>
<TE>   "All the characters came from inside of him," she said Friday
night. "That was him, and he was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Jones had become confined to a wheelchair. But he
retained his famously wry humor, his wife said.</TE>
<TE>   A recent example:</TE>
<TE>   "A week and a half ago," Marian Jones said, "several family
members were standing around his house, and he came in on a
wheelchair. He took one look and said, 'This is quite a confab of
people. Who is getting hung?'"</TE>
<TE>   Jones' fans included such contemporary filmmakers as George Lucas
and Steven Spielberg. Film director Peter Bogdanovich described
Jones' work as "like all good fables and only the best of art, both
timeless and universal."</TE>
<TE>   Just last year, Jones was inducted into the Animation Hall of Fame
in Los Angeles, along with Walt Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Among animators, Jones was considered "the father of contemporary
animation," said Terry Thoren, a longtime friend who heads the
animation studio that produces the Rug Rats cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the true leader of our industry after Walt Disney passed
away," Thoren said. "The fact that he is gone creates a big void in
our industry."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he was presented an honorary Oscar for Lifetime
Achievement. Among his many awards and recognitions, one of those he
most valued was the honorary life membership from the Directors Guild
of America, according to a family representative.</TE>
<TE>   He also produced, directed and wrote the screenplays for "Dr.
Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas," as well as the feature film
"The Phantom Tollbooth."</TE>
<TE>   The animation pioneer stayed active. In 2000, he launched a new
character, Timber Wolf, who appeared in a series on Warner Bros.
Online and Entertaindom.</TE>
<TE>   Born on Sept. 21, 1912, in Spokane, Wash., Jones grew up in
Hollywood, occasionally working as an child extra in Mack Sennett
comedies.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Chouinard Art Institute, which evolved into
the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Jones drew pencil
portraits for a dollar apiece on Olvera Street for a time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1932, he got his first job in the fledgling animation industry
as a cel washer for former Disney animator Ub Iwerks.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Jones became an animator for the Leon
Schlesinger Studio, which was later sold to Warner Bros., and in 1938
directed his first film, "The Night Watchman."</TE>
<TE>   Heading his own unit, Jones remained at Warner Bros. Animation
Department until it closed in 1962. During that time, he and
animators such as Tex Avery and Bob Clampett developed and refined
Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck and many others.</TE>
<TE>   The three men, whom Thoren called "the Beatles of animation," came
up with their own scripts while working in cramped bungalows on the
back lot of Warner Bros. Studios.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was the last surviving member of the trio.</TE>
<TE>   Jones moved to MGM, where he created new episodes for the Tom and
Jerry cartoon series. While there, he directed the Academy
Award-winning film "The Dot and the Line."</TE>
<TE>   He later started Chuck Jones Enterprises and produced nine
half-hour animated films for television including Rudyard Kipling's
"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi" and "The White Seal."</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1970s, Jones and daughter Linda Jones Clough started a
continuing art business, selling limited edition images created by
Jones and depicting scenes from his most enduring cartoons.</TE>
<TE>   One of those films was the 1957 Wagnerian mini-epic "What's Opera,
Doc?" The film was inducted in 1992 into the National Film Registry,
being praised as "among the most culturally, historically and
aesthetically significant films of our time."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Jones established the Chuck Jones Foundation to
recognize, support and inspire continued excellence in the art of
classic character animation.</TE>
<TE>   Jones also is survived by daughters Linda and Rosalin Bellante;
son Peter Dern; brother Richard Kent Jones; by his first wife,
Dorothy Webster, and by grandchildren Todd Kausen, Craig Kausen and
Valerie Ericsen, and Jason, Scott, and Kevin Bohrer of his wife by
her previous marriage. He also is survived by six
great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial is being planned in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family asked that contributions be made in
the name of Chuck Jones to the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund or to
the Chuck Jones Foundation.</TE>

<LD>In the course of my business, I have been in the Ventura County
clerk-recorder's office an average of once a week for the past 15
years. During that time, I have observed Phil Schmit supervising this
challenging department in a highly competent and pleasant manner.</LD>
<LD>   He understands complicated laws in areas of public access,
privacy, government, administrative and personnel matters, among
others. He is proficient in complex computer and accounting systems,
recording some 300,000 documents every year.</LD>
<LD>   He has the character to be trusted with the real property, birth,
death, marriage, election and other records of our county.</LD>
<TE>   I have seen his kindness in his dealings with the public and with
the employees of his department, and note how well-liked and
respected he is. I know of no more dedicated public servant than
Schmit and endorse his election as Ventura County clerk-recorder.</TE>

<LD>It has been my pleasure to know Randy Hoffman since long before he
threw his hat into the political ring.</LD>
<LD>   Several years ago, he approached me with some ideas on how he
could help us better enforce our narcotics laws with a technological
assist from his company.</LD>
<LD>   As I became more acquainted with him, it became apparent that he
was the genuine article. He was very interested in all aspects of
public safety in Ventura County. His support for narcotic law
enforcement has never wavered.</LD>
<TE>   Hoffman would bring much to the county Board of Supervisors. His
strong family values, truly legendary business skills, leadership
ability and willingness to find a way to get the job done are all
desirable traits for a county supervisor.</TE>

<TE>   As a former big-league manager for 26 years, I know how important
it is to play fair and to observe the rules. And sometimes you have
to tell a player to sit down and cool off if they are getting out of
control.</TE>
<TE>   I've lived in Thousand Oaks for 36 years, and I love this
community.</TE>
<TE>   I usually don't get involved in political campaigns, but the other
day I received a letter paid for by Randy Hoffman that was just plain
false.</TE>
<TE>   The letter accused [Thousand Oaks] Councilwoman Linda Parks of
voting against adding police patrols in 1997. These are the facts:
Parks supported adding more police--and voted to do so. She has
always been a stalwart supporter of law enforcement. But she refused
to vote to increase the sewer tax to further increase the public
safety budget. She believes, and so do I, that the sewer fee should
pay for the sewer--not for police.</TE>
<TE>   Parks was right. It would have been a horrible precedent to
increase user fees to pay for completely unrelated items. I applaud
Parks' courageous stand and I appreciate the fact that during her
term of office she supported and approved a 20% increase in our
police force.</TE>
<TE>   I think without a doubt there have been some very unfair attacks
on Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Parks stands out for her exceptional efforts to preserve the
quality of life of our community.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman doesn't even come close to matching Parks' record of
service and leadership.</TE>
<TE>   I ask you to join me in supporting and voting to make Parks our
next county supervisor.</TE>

<HD>Totten or Bamieh for District Attorney</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I attended a debate at the Simi Valley Library featuring both
candidates in the upcoming district attorney's race. Both of the
candidates began the debate very well, answering the questions very
thoroughly and knowledgeably.</LD>
<LD>   However, as the debate progressed, Greg Totten seemed to become
desperate to gain the upper hand. He badmouthed some of Ronald
Bamieh's supporters, including our very own council member, Barbra
Williamson. I felt really bad for Totten as he began to make
accusation after accusation as to Bamieh's supporters and so on.</LD>
<LD>   Totten could have at least lost the debate with dignity, yet
instead not only did he lose, but he lost poorly.</LD>
<TE>   I for one will not be voting for someone who has to sink to such
low levels to get votes. Totten should realize that he is hurting
himself more than helping with all of this negative campaigning. For
these reasons I will be voting for Bamieh on March 5, the last decent
man in the election.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Self</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If you want to know what kind of person Greg Totten is, listen to
what he has done.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 4, 1995, my husband, a Simi Valley police officer, was
shot and killed while checking the welfare of a man who openly hated
the police. In those few seconds my life was turned upside down. Over
the next few years I endured not one, but two trials, which at times
felt like a weight that I was never going to be able to rise above.</TE>
<TE>   Although I am not a politician, or of a political background, I
have been fortunate to meet and know many people in our local
government. And through them have been given the chance to have my
voice heard on many issues. Totten was one of those people.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997 Deputy Dist. Atty. Pete Kosoris put Totten in touch with
me. He asked if I wanted to make a difference. He invited me to go to
Sacramento to tell my story. He personally set up appointments with
representatives. Over a two-day period he escorted me through each
appointment and sat with me as I spoke before our state Legislature
supporting Senate Bill 1224 (mandating life without parole in certain
officer-killing cases). Through those two days, Totten always had an
optimistic view of the outcome, but never made any promises.</TE>
<TE>   I have a great respect for this man, not just because of what he
did, but because he never promised something that he could not
deliver. He brought an open mind, ear and heart to me. I always felt
that what I had to say mattered to him, and he gave it his full
attention. So, regarding the issue of victims rights, Totten is a man
of action.</TE>
<TE>   When he took the time to escort me to Sacramento he did so on his
own time. The only thing to be gained by this visit was to try to
ensure the protection of law enforcement families, not only here in

<LD>In the past, I have written some letters to the editor citing the
total nonperformance, noninterest of Supervisor [Judy] Mikels, except
when it furthers her needs (as in redistricting).</LD>
<LD>   We in Somis tried in vain to remove ourselves from her district,
only to find she had maneuvered the largest slice of the pie for
herself, which included an even larger portion of Somis.</LD>
<LD>   She has been absolutely no friend to farmland or to the citizens
under her domain. We would like to register a loud go for John Lane
for supervisor.</LD>
<TE>   This is our big opportunity to dislodge Mikels from our fate!</TE>
<TE>   Lane is a gift to us. Let us take this gift and get him in office!</TE>

<TE>   Judy Mikels deserves to be reelected. She is an independent
thinker who is open, straightforward and approachable. It needs to be
remembered that she voted against the infamous merger of Mental
Health with Social Services that was rescinded a few months later.
The failed merger brought forth an investigation of billing practices
that we later learned were practiced in other counties as well. But
Ventura County paid a heavy price as an example to others, and that
price cost the county millions of dollars for a vote that Mikels did
not contribute to.</TE>
<TE>   Her interest in both mental health and safety issues is
noteworthy. Appropriate placement or housing options for the mentally
ill would significantly reduce the load on the police and sheriff's
deputies who spend many hours responding to mentally ill people who
are homeless or ill-placed in the community. Better housing or
placement options would reduce other costs as well. The county needs
Mikels on its board.</TE>

<HD>Foster Care Is Targeted</HD>
<DH>Children: State controller forms an advocacy group to lobby
for the programs amid 'brutal' budget worries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State Controller Kathleen Connell has formed an advocacy group to
lobby legislators and others on behalf of foster children.</LD>
<LD>   ''I want to become the muscle for the foster care effort here in
California,'' she said.</LD>
<LD>   The first order of business: to defend foster care programs in
what promises to be a ''particularly brutal budget season.''</LD>
<TE>   Connell, who is serving her last year as controller, said she has
not worked out all the details of how the group will operate. Her
plan is to pull together a range of children's advocates to solve the
problems of the long-troubled foster care system. She said her office
will provide professional staff to get the group started.</TE>
<TE>   The controller's office pays the state's bills and conducts audits
of how state money is spent. Although the office has no direct
responsibility for foster care, a lawyer for Connell said the
controller can recommend plans for managing and improving the ways
public revenue is used.</TE>
<TE>   Connell said she came up with the idea for the group--launched
Friday in a conference call with prospective members--while auditing
child welfare programs in Los Angeles and Sacramento. She won't say
much about what flaws she found in the system--the audit results
won't be released until next month--but said a statewide leadership
void was among them.</TE>
<TE>   Child advocates, legislators, child welfare professionals, the
head of the state department charged with overseeing foster care
programs, and representatives of Gov. Gray Davis disagree with her
diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   ''Our group, like thousands of other groups in California,
represents the interests of the most vulnerable children in
California,'' said Alan Watahara, head of the nonprofit California
Children's Lobby, which has been working the halls in Sacramento
since 1971. ''There are clearly people speaking for these kids.''</TE>
<TE>   He had not heard of Connell's effort, but said he thought
leadership would more appropriately come from an official with the
power to implement the reforms.</TE>
<TE>   ''As a member of the foster care musculoskeletal system in
Sacramento, we are always in favor of more muscle,'' said Frank
Mecca, executive director of the County Welfare Directors Assn. ''But
like any complex organism, we have many important muscles and there
are people who have been muscling this issue ... for 30 years.''</TE>
<TE>   Mecca pointed to the Legislature's increase in funding in the area
for the last two years and the Democratic caucus' push last year for
a substantial increase, a plan eroded by the state's deficit.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is something we have devoted a great deal of time to,''
said Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), until recently
speaker of the lower house. ''I'm not saying it's perfect--it needs a
lot of money--but it's not an issue that has not gotten attention.''</TE>
<TE>   Rita L. Saenz, director of the Department of Social Services, said
that reforming the troubled child welfare system was the first
mandate she was given when she was appointed. She assembled an
advisory group two years ago that is moving toward that goal.</TE>
<TE>   But Connell said she thinks Saenz is politically hamstrung.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you are a subcabinet secretary and the governor has a tight
budget proposal that's moving forward, then it's very difficult for
you to go outside that and ask for more money,'' Connell said. ''They
have certain restraints that I don't have.''</TE>

<HD>Montebello Lottery Winner a No-Show</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a week after a record-breaking $193-million jackpot by the
California Lottery, one of three winners has yet to step forward.</LD>
<LD>   Friday evening, the state lottery announced a second winner has
identified himself, and his name would be announced today in Orange
County, where he bought the ticket.</LD>
<LD>   The first winner, in the Northern California town of Half Moon
Bay, claimed his prize of more than $64 million shortly after
Saturday's drawing.</LD>
<TE>   But the winning ticket sold in Montebello has yet to be presented.
That doesn't mean the money will go unclaimed, a state lottery
spokeswoman said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they want to get legal advice first," Cathy
Doyle-Johnston said. "Sometimes they want to gather their families
together for the formal award. Sometimes they're busy working."</TE>
<TE>   Of 1,992 grand prizes--each at least $3 million--awarded in the
history of the lottery, only 14 winners have failed to claim their
prize within the lottery's 180-day deadline, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The state lottery spokeswoman said the winner to be identified
today in Orange County has chosen to take a lump-sum payment of
nearly $33 million rather than 26 annual installments totaling $64
million.</TE>
<TE>   The winning tickets in Southern California, carrying the numbers
6, 11, 31, 32, 39 and the Mega Number 20, were purchased at 7-Eleven
stores. Both stores quickly received telephone calls from people
claiming to know of a winner, but no one immediately presented
himself or herself to the lottery, and some of the calls initially
were considered hoaxes.</TE>
<TE>   In Montebello, store owner Yvette Garcia said Friday, "We've been
getting calls. Somebody called and said it was her neighbor that had
the ticket. Another woman said her brother had the ticket, but he
couldn't come forward because he was in jail."</TE>
<TE>   Lottery officials on Monday plan to formally present checks for
$321,666 to each of the store owners--their share of the prize.</TE>
<TE>   If the third winner doesn't come forward, that money would go to
education funding.</TE>

<HD>Valley Man Gets 432 Years for Crime Spree</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An elusive San Fernando Valley man who set an apartment building on
fire and hid inside a mattress to escape police was sentenced Friday
to 432 years in state prison.</LD>
<LD>   Steven Maurice Miko, 38, was sentenced to 17 consecutive terms of
25 years to life plus seven years for a 11/2-month crime spree that
ended in April 2000 with a massive manhunt in North Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just an act of God that no one got hurt," said Los Angeles
County Superior Court Judge John S. Fisher, referring to two
high-speed police chases involving Miko.</LD>
<TE>   In the courtroom, Miko showed no reaction as Fisher pronounced one
life sentence after another. The man known for his escapes was
surrounded by nine sheriff's deputies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a death sentence, no doubt about it," said Miko's defense
attorney, Larry Sperber, after the sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   He said his client will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Miko, a third-striker with ties to the Nazi Low Rider gang, was
convicted in Van Nuys of kidnapping his girlfriend and assaulting
her, said Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Beth Silverman.</TE>
<TE>   He also was found guilty of multiple counts of burglary,
possessing stolen property and evading police.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a perfect career criminal," said Silverman, who specializes
in hard-core gang prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   Miko has three previous convictions for residential robbery and
one for burglary, she said.</TE>
<TE>   His crime spree began March 17, 2000, when a sheriff's deputy saw
Miko leave a Lancaster home with a gun holster, Silverman said. Miko
pointed a revolver at the deputy and fled in a stolen pickup.</TE>
<TE>   On April 1, he was spotted by authorities as he drove a stolen
Ford Explorer in Reseda. His girlfriend, who had been beaten and
stabbed, was handcuffed in the vehicle, Silverman said.</TE>
<TE>   Miko evaded police again, hiding in an Etiwanda Avenue apartment
and then setting fire to the building. He jumped from a third-story
window and ran into another building, where he cut a hole in a
mattress and hid inside it.</TE>
<TE>   He then cut his hair, shaved his mustache, changed his clothes and
walked out of the area unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, police went to an Arleta home to arrest Miko, and
he led them on a car chase.</TE>
<TE>   The manhunt ended four hours later in North Hills, with two police
helicopters, eight police dogs and 100 officers assisting in his
arrest.</TE>

<HD>Volunteer Coach Held in Sex Case</HD>
<DH>Moorpark: Man, 23, is arrested on suspicion of molesting a
14-year-old female student.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A volunteer wrestling coach at Moorpark High School has been arrested
on suspicion of committing sex acts with a 14-year-old female student
at the school.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Paul Fonseca, 23, of Moorpark remained in Ventura County
Jail on Friday in lieu of $75,000 bail, authorities said. He is being
held on suspicion of annoying and molesting a child under 18, having
sex with a minor and two other allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Fonseca is the second Ventura County high school coach in less
than a month to be accused of having sex with a minor student.</LD>
<TE>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, a 30-year-old science teacher and soccer
and tennis coach at Adolfo Camarillo High School, pleaded not guilty
last week to 33 counts of sex crimes involving nine students.</TE>
<TE>   Fonseca, an unpaid "walk-on" coach during the wrestling season
that ended earlier this month, was arrested Thursday after high
school officials notified the Ventura County Sheriff's Department of
the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "We got a report of an adult having a relationship with a
student," sheriff's spokesman Eric Nishimoto said. "We investigated
it and we arrested him."</TE>
<TE>   Fonseca is not an employee of the Moorpark Unified School
District, Supt. Frank DePasquale said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, volunteer coaches work under the supervision of
the school's wrestling coach, Pedro Lozano. They are subject to
background checks and fingerprinting.</TE>
<TE>   "We are conducting a full investigation and will take any actions
necessary," DePasquale said.</TE>
<TE>   Lozano, reached at his home, declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Bulk of Simon's Donations From Out of State</HD>
<DH>Campaign: Eastern bankers and brokers are his main
benefactors. His two GOP rivals are raising most of their money in
California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two weeks before the Republican primary election, gubernatorial
candidate Bill Simon Jr. had raised less money from Californians than
he did from wealthy donors in more than a dozen other states, an
analysis of his campaign reports shows.</LD>
<LD>   The multimillionaire businessman has raised $2.2 million outside
of California, or about 56% of his funds. He raised another $4.4
million in loans to his own campaign and contributions from his
family.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the out-of-state money came from investment bankers and
brokers in New York, where Simon lived for five years in the 1980s,
and New Jersey, where the Simon family investment business has an
office. Simon also received large donations from Colorado, Wyoming
and Connecticut.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, Simon's two major rivals in the Republican primary
have raised almost all their campaign money from within California.
Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, also a multimillionaire,
has tapped the wealthy for much of the $9 million he has raised, but
about 98% of that came from within the state. Secretary of State Bill
Jones, who has fallen far behind in total contributions, has not
raised substantial funds outside his San Joaquin Valley stronghold.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis has collected $3.4 million outside of California,
but that was only about 20% of the $15.8 million he raised altogether
in the last 14 months.</TE>
<TE>   The Riordan and Jones campaigns both criticized Simon's large
out-of-state contributions Friday, saying they illustrate his tenuous
connection to the California electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that just shows that Bill Simon hasn't been involved in
California politics," said Beth Pendexter, spokeswoman for the Jones
campaign. "He has no experience in California politics and has no
basis on which to ask people to give him a donation."</TE>
<TE>   "It really shows that he's a novice," said Mark Chapin Johnson,
state finance chairman for Riordan. "Obviously Dick Riordan's support
comes from California and Bill Simon's does not."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Simon campaign said the reliance on money from
family and business associates around the country was a necessity
brought on by the candidate's relatively recent first venture into
the state's political life.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that he's been inactive" in the decade he's lived in
California, said Sal Russo, Simon's political consultant. "It's that
his focus has been more on charitable activities in the way he
manifests his public concerns."</TE>
<TE>   When he decided to enter the governor's race last year, Simon
recognized he would have to be his own largest donor in the early
going, Russo said. He also knew he would need help from friends and
family around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where you raise your early money, which he did," Russo
said.</TE>
<TE>   Russo said Simon has worked hard to cultivate California donors.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very clear we will be able to raise the $30 million, $40
million we will need for the general [election]," Russo said.</TE>
<TE>   For advocates of campaign funding reform, the disproportionate
share of out-of-state money in the Simon campaign isn't particularly
alarming, although they acknowledged that it raises questions about
outside interests exercising influence in California.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be people who would be bothered by it, but it doesn't
bother me," said Bruce Cain, director of the Institute of
Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley. "I think California is such an
important state it doesn't shock me at all. It testifies as to how
important we are."</TE>
<TE>   Campaign finance reformer Robert M. Stern, the author of
California's contribution disclosure law, said he is more concerned
about Simon's loans, now totaling about $3.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with a candidate loaning his own campaign money, Stern
said, is that if the candidate wins, he will then be seeking campaign
contributions that will go directly into his pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies in Los
Angeles, said post-election donations thwart campaign disclosure
laws.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't see until after the election who is making those
contributions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Loans such as those Simon has made to himself will not be legal in
the next gubernatorial election, Stern said. Proposition 34, the 2000
statewide campaign financing reform initiative, already prohibits
candidates in legislative races from carrying loans over $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   The same provision would have applied to the current gubernatorial
race, Stern said, except that Davis threatened to veto the
initiative's enabling legislation unless its campaign finance limits
were postponed until after his reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Donations from the Simon family and personal friends are far less
troublesome than the loans, Stern said.</TE>
<TE>   "The main problem is what do people want for their money," he
said. "When a relative or a personal friend gives, they are usually
not asking for favors in return. But when a corporation gives, the
corporation has to justify the contribution saying this is for
business purposes."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's far-flung network of out-of-state donors is made up
largely of business people.</TE>
<TE>   Among his largest donors, for example, are Foster Friess of
Jackson, Wyo., founder of a mutual fund management firm; the Anschutz
Corp. of Denver; Edmund B. Ross, a private investor from New Jersey,
and William R. Grant, a New York venture capitalist.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be companies that did business with him or his father,
or it could be companies that want to do business in California, as
well," Stern said.</TE>

<HD>Mexican Muralist Inspires Students</HD>
<DH>Art: Raul Anguiano's new work, to be unveiled Tuesday, was
commissioned by East L.A. College, where he has taught since August.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a few strokes of charcoal, some swipes of red and green paint
and memories from his past, Raul Anguiano tells an intertwining
history of Mexican art, Mayan culture and his own life.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a universal language," says the soft-spoken 86-year-old
artist from Guadalajara. "Art is the way that I have always expressed
myself to the world."</LD>
<LD>   Since August, Anguiano could be found giving history lessons in
the East Los Angeles College auditorium. He doesn't use any
textbooks, just brushes, some cans of paint and a 68-foot-long,
13-foot-high canvas.</LD>
<TE>   "Lots of space, lots to say," Anguiano said of the opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   The finished product is scheduled to be unveiled at East Los
Angeles College on Tuesday, which is also Anguiano's 87th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   Anguiano is revered as one of the great Mexican muralists and
portrait painters alive today. A member of the third generation of
post-revolutionary painters, Anguiano has worked with such greats as
Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera, all of
whom are featured in his newest mural.</TE>
<TE>   "These are my friends and alumni of my generation," said Anguiano,
sporting his traditional painting garb, a beige fisherman's hat and
his dark-rimmed glasses. "This is not just a tribute to Mexican art.
It is a tribute to the people that made Mexican art what it is today.
I wish they could see this."</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, they can't.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been dead for a long time," said Anguiano, pointing to a
picture of Rivera. "So has he," he added about Orozco.</TE>
<TE>   But in the mural in the foyer of the Ingalls Auditorium and Edison
Performing Arts Center, all his painting buddies are full of life, as
inspiring as when Anguiano first met them.</TE>
<TE>   Anguiano shows no signs of slowing down, even after completing the
largest project of his career. He moves up and down a two-story
scaffolding as if he were at least 50 years younger. He never asks
for help getting up the steps and has the memory most students wish
they had, especially during exams.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to exercise the mind, and the body will follow," said
Anguiano, who makes his home in Huntington Beach and the wealthy
community of Coyoacan in Mexico City. "It's not really a secret to
living long, but I just want to learn something new every day."</TE>
<TE>   He has painted and taught art since he learned to walk and pick up
a crayon. Since he was 17, he has supported himself by painting or
teaching. At times it was a rough life--but an honest one, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Anguiano has illustrated many books and lectured and taught art in
the United States, Mexico and Europe. His work has been featured in
more than 100 shows throughout the world; numerous pieces are in
permanent collections around the world, including museums in China,
Poland and the Vatican. In the beginning, like all good artists,
Anguiano first had to learn how to draw. His first drawing, a torero,
or bullfighter, is pictured in the East Los Angeles College mural. He
drew the little bullfighter when he was just 4 years old, playing
with crayons and a piece of scratch paper.</TE>
<TE>   Many symbols of his life are strewn throughout the mural. The
painting's centerpiece is a reproduction of a photo taken in 1949,
during an expedition where Anguiano and U.S. explorer Carlos Frey
discovered the Bonampak ruins in Chiapas. This life-changing
experience spills out onto the rest of the canvas.</TE>
<TE>   The first part of the mural starts with a Mayan scribe, followed
closely by a black-and-white portrait of Anguiano as a baby
accompanied by his parents. The last piece of the mural is a recent
portrait of his wife, Brigita, and their dog, Tajin. Other pieces of
Mexican art include a crucifix, a controversial mural by Siqueiros
about the oppression of Mexicans in the United States, and portraits
of villagers during Anguiano's travels in Chiapas.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of producing the mural is $200,000, funded through
donations and fund-raising efforts by the East Los Angeles College
Foundation. Preserving and protecting it will cost even more, said
Sal Varela, foundation chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "Commissioning this mural continues East Los Angeles College's
commitment to bring art to the community," said college President
Ernest Moreno. "It should be here. This is the perfect place for it."</TE>
<TE>   Anguiano's life and work have inspired many in the East Los
Angeles art community. Students, faculty and others who stop by the
auditorium address him as el maestro, or the teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Many have sought his advice on art projects, from portraits to
ceramics. Anguiano enjoys talking to the young artists. Almost every
day he tears himself away from the mural to lecture students on
styles and techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Morales is taking full advantage of her time with el
maestro.</TE>
<TE>   Since the beginning of the project, Morales, a fine arts major at
the college, has helped Anguiano in many ways: picking up lunch,
cleaning brushes, buying paints. Part of the satisfaction is simply
being in his presence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's incredible just being here," said Morales, 25, of Commerce.
"Just watching him is an experience in itself, but he lets us
critique him also. He says it is better to have more than one set of
eyes."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, she and other students have spotted some things the old
painter had missed.</TE>
<TE>   "We have actually found some mistakes, and he was grateful,"
Morales said. "So I guess we are also learning how to become maestros
also."</TE>

<HD>Muslims, Jews Join to Honor Abraham</HD>
<DH>History: Seeking to learn of Islam, temple group visits
mosque on a day dedicated to their common patriarch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On one of Islam's most important holidays, a day dedicated to the
remembrance of Abraham, Los Angeles Muslims and Jews met Friday and
reminded themselves of their common patriarch.</LD>
<LD>   With 45 members in tow, Rabbi Harold Schulweis of Valley Beth
Shalom journeyed from Encino and crossed mountains, literal and
otherwise, to meet with the Muslims of King Fahd Mosque in Culver
City. For many from Schulweis' Conservative congregation, it was
their first visit to a mosque prayer service--yet, they said, it
somehow seemed familiar.</LD>
<LD>   Judy Geller noticed the absence of statues and pictures; Judaism
and Islam shy away from what the Bible calls graven images. Others
noted the physical separation of men and women, also common to
Orthodox Judaism. Schulweis, half-jokingly, noticed the collection
boxes.</LD>
<TE>   And there was Abraham, the common patriarch--who was the subject
of Imam Tajuddin Shuaib's Friday sermon and is praised in calligraphy
adorning the mosque's domed hall. Shuaib spoke about Abraham's
willingness to sacrifice a son until God lifted the command. That
event was celebrated Friday by Muslims worldwide during the start of
the three-day festival Eid ul-Adha, marking the end of the hajj--the
pilgrimage to Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   ''There is the shock of recognition that we have common roots and
desires,'' said Schulweis.</TE>
<TE>   The trip to the mosque was the rabbi's first foray into the
sometimes prickly arena of Muslim-Jewish relations. One of the
Southland's most influential rabbis, Schulweis broke ground more than
three decades ago in nurturing Jewish-Catholic ties. Cardinal Roger
M. Mahony's two visits to his synagogue several years ago, he said,
startled Catholics and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Schulweis said, it was time to reach out to Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   Groundwork for the trip was laid last fall, when Schulweis invited
Nazir Khaja of the Islamic Information Service to speak on Islam as
part of the synagogue's lecture series on world religions. The
lecture, delivered two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks,
drew 2,200 people, the largest crowd of the series.</TE>
<TE>   In return, Khaja arranged the reciprocal visit to the King Fahd
Mosque, which the Jewish Defense League allegedly sought to bomb last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Because of such threats and the chill American Muslims have felt
since the terrorism attacks, Khaja said, Muslims have ''begun to see
we need to reach out and grasp the hands of friends. This is the need
of the hour and the dictates of our faith.''</TE>
<TE>   To build on Friday's exchange, the rabbi suggested that his
synagogue's havurah, or groups of families, invite Muslims into their
homes to share food, holidays and friendships.</TE>
<TE>   ''If there is no dialogue, there is a terrible silence, and that
often leads to dislike, contempt and sometimes violence,'' Schulweis
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, there was no lack of dialogue as several of his female
congregants clustered around their Muslim counterparts and peppered
them with questions.</TE>
<TE>   Do you take your scarves off outside the mosque? Do Muslims
embrace converts? Do you believe in a day of judgment? Do you tithe?</TE>
<TE>   As one of the Muslims explained that those who wrong someone must
ask their forgiveness, the Jewish women nodded. ''That's the same in
Judaism,'' one said.</TE>
<TE>   ''We are people of the book, so we are your cousins, your
family,'' a female mosque elder said with a smile. ''So get to know
us, and we will get to know you.''</TE>

<HD>Bacteria Recruited in Cleanup</HD>
<DH>Environment: Harmless microorganisms will help remove
decades of pollution at naval base.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Harmless bacteria that break down toxic chemicals are one of the
secret weapons behind a more than $50-million cleanup at Naval Base
Ventura County that aims to remove decades of poisons and pollution.</LD>
<LD>   The long-term cleanup campaign--really a series of smaller
decontamination efforts throughout the 6,100-acre facility since the
mid-1970s--calls for identifying and removing toxins such as
gasoline, paint solvent and pesticides from soil and ground water,
said environmental engineer Steve Granade, who oversees the work on
the Point Mugu side of the base.</LD>
<LD>   "We have tried to break it up into bite-sized pieces," Granade
told a small group of residents who gathered Thursday evening for an
update on the cleanup.</LD>
<TE>   The base has identified nearly 40 sites that are either polluted
or warrant further study.</TE>
<TE>   "None of them are threatening to the population, but there's
things you have to act on," said Steve McCarel, the environmental
restoration manager for the base's Port Hueneme side.</TE>
<TE>   The Point Mugu portion of the base has about 15 cleanup sites,
which range from about 100 square feet to the 2,500-acre Mugu Lagoon,
Granade said.</TE>
<TE>   The lagoon contains contaminants not only from the base but from
every community--from Simi Valley to Camarillo--whose water drains
into Calleguas Creek. The creek empties into the lagoon, so cleanup
will be a countywide effort, Granade said.</TE>
<TE>   At one site, government environmental groups plan to take tissue
samples of plants and animals and run toxicological tests to
determine whether further action is needed, Granade said.</TE>
<TE>   At another site near a painting facility, Navy environmental
engineers use various bacteria that convert toxins from cleaning
solvents into their harmless component elements.</TE>
<TE>   The process begins by injecting lactic acid into the ground to
help the bacteria grow.</TE>
<TE>   "They love this stuff and they eat it," Granade said. "The number
of bacteria increases."</TE>
<TE>   The bacteria then go to work converting the chlorinated solvents
in the ground. "They literally breathe the metallic solvents," he
said. "The more chlorine it has, the more they like it."</TE>
<TE>   But because part of the process produces a carcinogenic compound,
engineers add a second type of bacteria, whose enzymes help finish
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Oxygen also will be injected into the ground to speed the final
cleanup. Because two distinct types of bacteria are used, the
timeline for the overall cleanup has been reduced from 15 years to
about 15 months, Granade said.</TE>
<TE>   Point Mugu officials this week received the first payment of $2.7
million in restoration funds for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30,
according to project manager Mike Gonzales.</TE>
<TE>   The Port Hueneme side expects $1.4 million this year for cleanup,
said Josh Fortenberry, Gonzales' counterpart. That amount includes
$250,000 to monitor, pump and treat a plume of the gasoline additive
methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, and $350,000 for a study of
metal toxins.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going as well as it can go," McCarel said.</TE>

<LD>The Los Alamitos Unified School District and its teachers union have
reached an impasse in their labor negotiations and will require a
mediator, something that has not happened in the district in more
than a decade, union and school officials said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers complain that the district's proposal to raise salaries
by 1% for the current fiscal year will be offset by another proposal
to raise the employees' contributions to health-and-welfare benefits
by $400,000.</LD>
<LD>   District officials say Los Alamitos teachers will remain among the
highest paid in Orange County under their plan.</LD>

<HD>Park Campaign Dollar Edge Over Airport Tallied</HD>
<DH>El Toro: Backers of a green initiative for the closed El
Toro base raise three times the money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Groups supporting a ballot measure to turn the former El Toro Marine
base into a giant park have raised more than three times the money of
those fighting to turn it into an international airport.</LD>
<LD>   With the election 10 days away, supporters of Measure W, which
would rezone the 4,700 acres primarily as a park, have raised about
$970,000. The anti-Measure W forces have raised about $288,000.</LD>
<LD>   The anti-W forces' financial situation was severely hurt when a
San Diego County judge ruled that Orange County supervisors could not
spend the $6 million they had pledged for mailers and forums
detailing the pro-airport plans.Similarly, Newport Beach's plans to
spend $3.7 million on a campaign for an alternative to nearby John
Wayne Airport also were halted.</LD>
<TE>   However, Len Kranser, a spokesman for the Committee for Safe and
Healthy Communities-Yes on Measure W, said rumors are that a wealthy
pro-airport supporter has offered to match whatever the No on Measure
W forces can raise.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the rumor, Dave Ellis, a consultant for the "No on W"
Airport Working Group, said, "I don't know that to be a fact,"
although he would not deny it outright. If the rumor were true, it
would mean a last-minute infusion of cash for the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, developer George Argyros has been perhaps the most
important financial backer of the airport effort, but after he was
nominated as U.S. ambassador to Spain, he said he would end his
active involvement in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Recent polls have shown Measure W leading with the public.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed airport has become the primary issue in the race for
supervisor between pro-airport incumbent Cynthia P. Coad and
Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby, who opposes an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Coad is part of the pro-airport majority on the Board of
Supervisors, along with Jim Silva and Chuck Smith. A Norby victory
would transform the board after years of support for the airport.</TE>
<TE>   The latest campaign statements show Coad receiving about nine
times more money than her opponent. Most of the funding for Coad's
race has come from loans, much from her own pocket.</TE>
<TE>   During the reporting period covering Jan. 20 through Feb. 16, she
has loaned her campaign $250,000 and raised nearly $21,000. Campaign
disclosure statements show her campaign receiving contributions of
$925,000, all but $27,000 of that in loans. Of those loans, at least
$390,000 has come from Coad, who is married to a retired dentist and
wealthy investor.</TE>
<TE>   Norby has received $103,000 in contributions, none of it in loans.
Most of his support has come from South County, where anti-airport
feeling is highest.</TE>
<TE>   While Norby ended the reporting period with $23,000 in cash, Coad
had $203,000 on hand.</TE>
<TE>   Fund-raising in the district attorney's race between incumbent
Tony Rackauckas and veteran prosecutor Wally Wade is much more
closely matched. Both men have made loans to their campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas raised $139,000 in the last reporting period, with
$70,000 of that coming from his loan.</TE>
<TE>   Wade raised $51,000 the last six weeks. He has also given his
campaign $55,000 in loans.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers show Rackauckas spending more money, $190,000, to
Wade's $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   Little money is being raised by any of the candidates for the
Superior Court seat held by Judge Ronald C. Kline. Kline has pleaded
not guilty to child molestation and possession of child pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Kline is the only candidate listed on the ballot for judicial
office No. 21, but he faces a passel of write-in challengers.</TE>
<TE>   If no one receives more than 50% of the votes, the top two
vote-getters will meet in a runoff in November.</TE>
<TE>   Several candidates, including Kline, filed forms saying they will
raise less than $1,000. The others are Dale Peroutka, Dan C. Dutcher,
Marilyn W. Mirano and Terese S. Oliver. James Stone filed a campaign
statement that showed he had not raised any money.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the other candidates for Kline's seat were financing most
of their own campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Robinson, a Costa Mesa city councilwoman running for Kline's
seat, had raised the most money, $33,000, with $20,000 of it coming
as a loan from herself.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates for Kline's seat include: John Adams, who had
raised $32,000, including his $28,000 loan; Harris E. Kershnar, who
loaned himself $25,000 of the $30,000 he has raised; and Gay
Sandoval, who has raised nearly $13,000. Her husband, Joe Sandoval,
had loaned her campaign $11,500.</TE>

<LD>In the never-ending stupid criminal tricks competition, a robber
accosted a man on a Norwalk sidewalk and demanded his cellular phone,
the Long Beach Press Telegram's police log reported.</LD>
<LD>   The assailant "then ran away yelping when the victim poured hot
coffee on his head."</LD>
<LD>   Too bad the victim couldn't have given the assailant a couple of
lumps with that coffee.</LD>

<TE>   * And a salad offer that was certified by Arthur Andersen (from Ed

<TE>   The Ape Man would be proud: You wouldn't associate the new movie
"Queen of the Damned," which is about a vampire rock star, with "The
Graduate" (1967), which is about an uptight college grad. But in
"Queen," a groupie tells the toothy singer, "I came all the way from
Tarzana." And in "The Graduate," the parents of Ben (Dustin Hoffman)
lure him out of the bedroom to attend a party at their Pasadena home
by pointing out, "The Carlsons are here.... They came all the way
from Tarzana."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the two movies don't have much in common, but they'll always
have Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   My still unpublished book, "Great--and Not-So-Great--Movie
Dialogue About the Valley," contains two other references to Reseda's

but I was born in Tarzana."</TE>
<TE>   * And in "2 Days in the Valley," a 60ish apartment dweller hears a
brawl on the floor above in the middle of the night and tells his
wife: "Maybe that's how they make love in Tarzana."</TE>

<HD>The Grand Plan: Uninterrupted Coastal Trail</HD>
<DH>A group of dedicated hikers is fighting to remove barriers
along the shoreline of California. With help in high places, they
just might pull it off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Nichols began walking the California coastline in June 1996,
starting at the Oregon line. Ninety-six days and two pairs of boots
later, he arrived at the Mexican border.</LD>
<LD>   Now he is preparing to do it again--all 1,156 miles--next summer.</LD>
<LD>   This 59-year-old environmentalist with a walrus mustache longs for
another immersion in the gorgeous scenery that unfolds a step at a
time along the California Coastal Trail.</LD>
<TE>   But he loathes the artificial barriers that have sprouted along
the coastline and that all too often force him off the beach and onto
the shoulder of California1.</TE>
<TE>   His life's dream--and the ultimate goal of his job as director of
the nonprofit group Coastwalk--is to see an uninterrupted Coastal
Trail, one that is safe, well-marked by signs and doesn't shunt
pedestrians onto the highway.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I'll be 85," he said, "but I hope to walk a completed trail
before I go."</TE>
<TE>   He might make it.</TE>
<TE>   After years of languishing, the grand plan for a continuous
Coastal Trail that threads its way across beaches and bluff tops is
beginning to gain momentum.</TE>
<TE>   The White House designated the pathway a Millennium Legacy Trail,
and the California Legislature declared it an official state trail.
These are largely symbolic acts, but they can help open the spigot
for government funds.</TE>
<TE>   More important, the Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis passed a law
ordering state and local agencies to figure out how to finish the
trail. They even ponied up $10 million to speed the process.</TE>
<TE>   So the state Coastal Conservancy, working with state parks
officials and the California Coastal Commission, is supposed to
report to the Legislature by next January with a master plan that
shows the impediments to a continuous trail and estimates how much it
will cost to remove them by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 65% of the coastline has marked trails or is easily
accessible. The rest is another matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not kidding ourselves that this will be easy or can be
done overnight," said Steve Horn, deputy executive officer of the
Coastal Conservancy. "But we believe it's an idea whose time has
come."</TE>
<TE>   Horn likens it to knitting together the 2,160-mile Appalachian
Trail, which took about 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of snaking unobtrusively through 2,160 miles of
Eastern forest and semi-wilderness, the California Coastal Trail
would cross some of the most expensive real estate in America.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the thorniest problem. Private property owners
from Malibu to Mendocino don't much care for the idea of thousands of
strangers traipsing across their oceanfront property.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy McCaw, owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press and a supporter
of many environmental causes, is challenging a narrow public right of
way that the trail follows across the beach below her 25-acre
bluff-top estate. Although she has lost a series of courtroom battles
so far, she vows to take her case to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Other barriers abound. Vandenberg Air Force Base restricts access
to its 35 miles of coastline during rocket launches. Point Mugu Naval
Air Station in Ventura County is fenced off to keep the public away
from hazardous beams of powerful radar. The Marine Corps doesn't
allow walkers to interrupt training exercises on the beach at Camp
Pendleton in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   The steep slopes along the Big Sur coastline provide little
foothold for a trail other than the shoulder of California 1. To the
south, the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant, which uses ocean water
as coolant, bars the public from a 10-mile stretch of rocky shoreline
and pocket beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it easy to get around the Los Angeles and Long Beach
harbors. The Vincent Thomas Bridge is closed to pedestrians. When
Coastwalkers reach this area, they have to hire a boat to ferry them
across San Pedro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal laws guarantee public access to the coast. More
specifically, the public owns "tidelands," or everything seaward of
the mean high-tide line. That generally means people cannot be barred
from walking on the wet sand.</TE>
<TE>   But that line is ever-shifting with the erosive power of high
tides and storm-driven waves. Furthermore, many of California's
beaches have narrowed over the years as streams and rivers have been
dammed, robbing beaches of annual infusions of fresh sand.</TE>
<TE>   Property owners have responded by building sea walls and
depositing refrigerator-size rocks to protect seaside homes and
restaurants. So in places like Malibu, multimillion-dollar homes and
fancy fish eateries that once sat back from the beach now intrude
into the surf zone, their protective structures blocking passage
along the shore.</TE>
<TE>   Such obstacles annoy Norbert Dall, a headstrong former Sierra Club
lobbyist who recently trekked the 27-mile Malibu shoreline with
biologist David Kelley to take an inventory of obstructions.</TE>
<TE>   At Latigo Point, his hike was halted by monstrous boulders piled
on the beach to protect a home built on stilts. He opened his
notebook, remarking, "That's got to come out."</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Conservancy is expecting Dall's recommendations, Horn
said. But he thinks it is unlikely that state officials will be
ordering the removal of any artificial structures.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the conservancy is asking for the cooperation of every
coastal county, city and gated community to suggest where to put the
trail.</TE>
<TE>   A cooperative spirit may not always prevail, said Linda Locklin,
the Coastal Commission's public access manager. As an example, she
pointed out how the owners of Hollister Ranch, a gated community of
ranchettes in Santa Barbara County, have fought vigorously over the
years to keep their eight-mile stretch of coastline to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   It has yet to be determined, Locklin said, whether state officials
will force property owners to open their shoreline or whether they
will be satisfied to allow the Coastal Trail to detour inland.</TE>
<TE>   Coastwalk, a nonprofit group of determined hikers, many of them
older and retired, continues to apply subtle but steady pressure to
open up the entire coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not combative, but I see the trail as something we should do
for future generations," said Donald Nerlich, a Coastwalk board
member and semiretired UCLA professor.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to re-create the splendor he experienced as a Boy Scout,
hiking an interrupted beach route from Santa Monica to Malibu.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the best way to experience a place," said Nichols,
Coastwalk's director. "It's an experience you cannot get through a
windshield. You have to be out there."</TE>

<HD>Johannes Cornelis Princen, 76; Indonesian Human Rights
Activist</HD>

<LD>Johannes Cornelis Princen, 76, a former Dutch colonial soldier who
became one of Indonesia's leading human rights activists, died Friday
in his Jakarta home of a stroke, family members said.</LD>
<LD>   Princen, who had been bedridden since 1998 when he suffered an
earlier stroke, served as a soldier in the colonial army that fought
to reoccupy the archipelago, then known as the Dutch East Indies,
after the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II.</LD>
<LD>   Although Princen was awarded Indonesia's highest military award,
he soon fell out with the country's founding President Sukarno over
the government's persecution of political opponents. He was
imprisoned from 1962 to 1964.</LD>
<TE>   After 1965, when a military dictatorship led by Gen. Suharto
overthrew the civilian government, Princen was jailed several times
on charges of organizing illegal political protests.</TE>
<TE>   He headed the Institute for Defense of Human Rights, which handled
many high-profile human rights cases during the Suharto dictatorship.</TE>

<HD>Edmar J. Mednis, 64: Chess Grandmaster First to Beat Bobby
Fischer</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edmar J. Mednis, 64, a chess grandmaster who was the first player to
best Bobby Fischer in a United States Chess Championship Tournament,
died Feb. 13 in New York City of complications of pneumonia.</LD>
<LD>   Mednis played Fischer in the first round of the U.S. Chess
Championship Tournament for 1962-63. Although he had participated in
several tournaments, he was not seen as a threat to Fischer, who had
won the championship four times and had not lost a game in an
American tournament since 1957. The match went to 73 moves before
Fischer resigned.</LD>
<LD>   In the overall tournament, Fischer recovered to win the
championship while Mednis finished poorly. He would play Fischer six
other times in tournament competition, drawing once and losing five.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Riga, Latvia, Mednis came to the U.S. with his family in
1950. Educated as a chemical engineer, he also worked as a stock
market investor but ultimately became a professional chess player.</TE>
<TE>   He began writing books on chess in 1973 and was a regular
contributor to Chess Life magazine. He attained grandmaster status in
1980 and was inducted into the U.S. Chess Hall of Fame in 2000.</TE>

<HD>Byrne Piven, 72; Influential Acting Teacher, Director</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Byrne Piven, an actor and director whose work as a teacher of theater
influenced generations of Chicago-area actors, including John Cusack
and his sister Joan, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Piven died Monday of complications from lung cancer at St. Francis
Hospital in Evanston, Ill.</LD>
<LD>   With his wife, Joyce, a director and actress, Piven established an
acting workshop in Evanston that during its 30 years shaped the work
of such prominent stage and film actors as the Cusacks and their
sister Ann; Lili Taylor; Aidan Quinn; and the Pivens' two children,
Shira and Jeremy.</LD>
<TE>   At the same time, Piven kept up his own career as a director and
actor, appearing in dozens of television shows and films.</TE>
<TE>   ''He had been doing six shows a week playing King Lear at our
theater in Evanston last summer in a production that our daughter,
Shira, directed, and he was loving every minute of it,'' Joyce Piven
said. She added: ''Then, in November, we found he had lung cancer,
and after that, it went quickly.''</TE>
<TE>   Born in Scranton, Pa., Piven went to work as an actor in New York
but moved to Chicago in 1954.</TE>
<TE>   ''I bumped into Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Ed Asner,
Barbara Harris and Sheldon Patinkin, and we all started the wonderful
Playwright's Theatre Club,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   From that company, Second City and the Compass Players emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Piven, who met her husband at the Playwright's Theatre Club
and married him in 1954, said they left Chicago in 1955 to work and
study in New York, but they returned in 1967 to appear in the
short-lived Second City Repertory company.</TE>
<TE>   The couple later set up their acting workshop in Evanston.</TE>
<TE>   Their students included all five Cusack children as well as the
Pivens' children.</TE>
<TE>   Shira Piven lives and works with her husband, Second City alumnus
Adam McKay, in New York with their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Piven has made a successful career for himself in
television and movies, including ''Black Hawk Down,'' and often works
with his boyhood friend John Cusack.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of his life, in a tribute to Byrne Piven's influence
in their lives, several former students flew to Chicago to be with
him. The Cusacks and Quinn were at the hospital, along with about 20
other friends.</TE>
<TE>   ''When John [Cusack] first went into the movies, people remarked
how well-prepared he was for such a young actor,'' his father,
Richard Cusack, said. ''That all came from what he had learned with
Joyce and Byrne at the Piven Theatre Workshop.''</TE>
<TE>   John Cusack, who spent several hours with Piven in the hospital,
said: ''He was very ill, but he had such a big heart that he sort of
willed himself into consciousness while we all were there. We needed
to tell him how much he had meant to us.''</TE>

<HD>Irvine Co. Gift to Come With Traffic Impact</HD>
<DH>Transit: Halting of new road developments could funnel
drivers to already crowded existing streets, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON and EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Irvine Co.'s gift of 11,000 acres of open space will have a
dramatic side effect: development and traffic will be so reduced that
some long-planned streets and major road extensions might not be
built.</LD>
<LD>   Daily auto trips would drop from an estimated 500,000 to 72,000 by
eliminating development on the land to be set aside in northeastern
Orange County, according to a memo Orange County Transportation
Authority chief officer Arthur Healy sent Thursday to board members.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, proposed multimillion-dollar extensions to roads in
unincorporated county areas and in four cities--Orange, Anaheim,
Irvine and Tustin--will no longer be needed, Healy concluded.</LD>
<TE>   "The area to be impacted by the changes is huge, ranging from [the
Riverside Freeway] to Interstate 5, and [the Costa Mesa Freeway] to
the Cleveland National Forest," Healy told board members. "There will
be many traffic impacts."</TE>
<TE>   The prospect of fewer new roads is being applauded by
preservationists and outdoor enthusiasts, but some local officials
are concerned that any new development will funnel traffic onto
already crowded roadways.</TE>
<TE>   Some also fear that the financial health of the Eastern toll road,
Orange County's only successful tollway, might be jeopardized.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that the bonding for those roads was based on
ambitious plans from the Irvine Co.," said Joanne Coontz, a member of
the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency and Orange City
Council. "Their plans included not only residential, but commercial,
high-end industrial and schools."</TE>
<TE>   Healy said that because of the changes, traffic analysis was
needed to decide how the county's Master Plan of Arterial Highways
might need to be revised. He said an offer by the Irvine Co. to pay
for and conduct such a study for OCTA and other agencies has been
accepted.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. spokesman John Christiansen said the company was
beginning to discuss the impact of the gift with local governments
and agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Healy said in his memo that because the Irvine Co. wants a "quick
turnaround," and because it is "anxious" to move forward with revised
developments in Orange and elsewhere, he and a group of affected
agencies decided to let the company conduct its own traffic study of
the potential impact.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Mayor Pro Tem Mike Alvarez said he was unaware such a study
was being launched, and that it should be independently funded and
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said he is besieged with complaints from residents about
traffic conditions.</TE>
<TE>   By eliminating the extensions of Culver and Jeffrey roads, he
said, any new traffic from 4,200 new homes still planned by the
Irvine Co. would be shunted onto Chapman Avenue.</TE>

<TE>   Culver, Jeffrey and Jamboree roads are all slated to be extended
under the county's master plan. Santiago Canyon Road also will
undergo major upgrades. Much of the funding the Irvine Co. would have
been required to provide for those roads now will evaporate.</TE>
<TE>   Irvine Co. spokesman John Christiansen said the company was
beginning to discuss the impact of the gift with local governments
and agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "A number of specific issues need to be addressed and will be as
we work through this planning process," he said.</TE>

<TE>   Chapman Avenue May Be Even More Crowded</TE>
<TE>   Orange Mayor Pro Tem Mike Alvarez said he was unaware such a study
was being launched, and that it should be independently funded and
conducted.</TE>
<TE>   "Whomever Irvine Co. hires is going to do a study that would
satisfy the Irvine Co. first," Alvarez said. "They can do that all
they want, but we as a city can say this stuff stinks. There are
going to be traffic issues, no matter what they say."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez said he is besieged with complaints from residents about
traffic conditions. By eliminating the extensions of Culver and
Jeffrey roads, he said, any new traffic from 4,200 new homes still
planned by the Irvine Co. would be shunted onto Chapman Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   While Healy's memo said the Eastern toll road could be impacted by
the changes, others suggested that population growth in Riverside
County and northern San Diego County will make up the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a bigger regional picture," said Scott Diehl, chairman
of the Eastern tollway board and a San Clemente City Council member.
"Even if the growth happens in Riverside or San Diego counties, those
people will still need to get to jobs in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to downplay this and say not developing 11,000 acres
won't impact us," Diehl said. "But does it break our financing models
so we can't be successful? I don't think so."</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Merced County animal control officers and officials
of the U.S. Humane Society number and photograph 233 roosters that
were allegedly being bred for fighting at a residence near Snelling,
Calif., on Friday. The owner of the property was arrested on charges
of raising the roosters with the intent of using them in cockfights,
said Merced County Sheriff's Sgt. Doug Jansen. Jansen said the birds
were valued at $200 to $10,000 each. In a cockfight, two roosters are
placed in a pit to fight, usually to the death, with their spurs
replaced by metal blades. Cockfighting has been illegal in California
since 1905, according to the Animal Protection Institute.</CP>

<HD>Santa Paula Council to Place Voting Districts on Fall
Ballot</HD>
<DH>Election: The measure could scrap the at-large system in
the heavily Latino city. It comes amid a federal suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to satisfy the terms of a federal lawsuit, a divided
Santa Paula City Council has approved placing a measure on the
November ballot that could carve the mostly Latino community into
five voting districts.</LD>
<LD>   Council members Laura Flores Espinosa and John Procter pushed to
delay the decision until April, saying more public education was
needed on the issue. But the other three members, including Mayor Ray
Luna, said Thursday it was time to move forward.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure the board majority wants the community to be as little
informed as possible," said Espinosa, who was the sole Latino on the
council before Luna's election in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   "It was the usual 3-2 vote," Espinosa said.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Phil Romney will craft the ballot measure in coming
weeks, and a committee will help draw the proposed district
boundaries before July.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking a giant step, and it's going to change Santa Paula
forever," Luna said. "I'm not saying it's the best thing for the
city, and it could create more division. I guess we'll find out."</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in April
2000, alleged that the city's at-large voting system violated the
Voting Rights Act of 1965 and perpetuated racial discrimination by
preventing Latino candidates from being elected to the council.</TE>
<TE>   In August, city leaders agreed to a settlement that included
giving voters the say on whether to remain with an at-large election
system or create a district format in which council members would
represent specific neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Justice officials and civil rights activists believe a district
system would yield better representation for Latinos, in part because
many neighborhoods in the city are almost entirely Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "That has been the traditional remedy for racially polarized
voting," Espinosa said. "This is a major opportunity for citizens to
be able to have representative government, and that strengthens the
voice of the community."</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa has been criticized in the past for her support of the
Department of Justice action. In December, she was passed over for
the ceremonial mayoral post, angering Latino activists who said it
served to further divide the city's working-class Latino population
from the white establishment.</TE>
<TE>   If a majority of the city's 10,734 registered voters pass the
measure, Santa Paula would become the first city in the county to
elect its leaders by district.</TE>
<TE>   While common in large cities, the move is unusual for such a small
town, Ventura County elections chief Bruce Bradley said.</TE>
<TE>   Of the city's 29,000 residents, about two-thirds are Latino. But a
much smaller proportion is registered to vote and an even smaller
proportion turns out on election day. Only six Latinos have ever been
elected to the council in the city's 100-year history.</TE>
<TE>   From now until November, Espinosa said, she will work to register
more Santa Paula residents to vote and educate voters on the
difference between at-large and district voting. The council in
August approved spending $50,000 on a nonpartisan voter-registration
drive.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than a week before the deadline, the California Arts Council had
received only 10 nominations for the freshly formalized post of state
poet laureate, prompting pointed gibes at California's literary
might.</LD>
<LD>   But thanks to a flurry of last-minute entries from everyone from
university presidents to entertainment executives, the final tally of
nominees is 33, the council said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The state has had chief poets since 1915, but historically has
chosen them based as much on politics as literary merit. Last year,
legislators decided to change that, approving a detailed set of
qualifications and duties for the job.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court set aside the sentence of a longtime deathrow
inmate Friday until another court reviews whether a juror in his 1979
trial was biased.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling marks the fifth time this month that the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned or delayed a California
execution.</LD>
<LD>   Convicted murderer Stevie Lamar Fields argued that a juror in his
trial should have been disqualified because the juror's wife was the
victim of crimes similar to those Fields was charged with committing.</LD>
<TE>   Fields was convicted of a Los Angeles crime spree that included
the fatal shooting of Rosemary Cobbs, an acquaintance and student
librarian at USC, as well as the kidnapping and sexual assault of
three other women.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council calls it a peace park, but the planned tribute to an
antiwar activist is creating conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The council approved funding for the $93,000 downtown park. The
city plans to build a Wall of Consequence there that will include
debris from attacks on civilians around the world, including the
World Trade Center; Hiroshima, Japan; and the Alfred B. Murrah
Federal Building in Oklahoma City.</LD>
<LD>   Park opponent Karen Christopherson said using the debris would
exploit the dead to further a political agenda that the victims may
not have shared.</LD>
<TE>   The park would be named for activist Doug Rand, who died two years
ago of a brain tumor.</TE>
<TE>   He fought to stop a Navy ship from coming to Santa Cruz,
campaigned against violence-themed toys and tried to dissuade people
from registering for the draft.</TE>

<LD>A San Mateo County high school teacher failed to convince a jury that
two other teachers had sexually harassed her because she is a
lesbian.</LD>
<LD>   In a 9-3 vote, the jury found that the two teachers did not harass
Teresa "Tere" Curl. She was fired from Menlo-Atherton High School in
March 2000 after teacher Alan Ida discovered a gun in Curl's
classroom.</LD>
<LD>   Curl, 43, sued Ida and teacher Al Ramirez, along with the Sequoia
Union High School District, for harassment after the incident. She
said Ramirez and Ida called her derogatory names and taunted her with
sexually explicit gestures. She accused the district of ignoring the
harassment.</LD>

<HD>Court Upholds Denial of Woman's Passport</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Friday that a woman who is nearly
$30,000 behind in child support payments can be denied a passport.</LD>
<LD>   Eudene Eunique, a lawyer in the desert town of Lucerne Valley, had
argued that international travel was her constitutional right, but
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed.</LD>
<LD>   It upheld a federal law allowing the government to withhold
passports from anyone more than $5,000 in debt to their child's other
parent.</LD>
<TE>   The court ruled 2 to 1 that Eunique should not be given a passport
that would let her visit family in Mexico and establish potential
business contacts with a Peruvian law firm. That money instead should
be spent on her children, the court ruled.</TE>
<TE>   The justices also noted that, if granted a passport, Eunique could
simply leave the country and skip out on her debts.</TE>

<HD>Insect Pest Fails to Reach Wine Country, State Says</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Two-year battle against unregulated shipment
of nursery plants is producing results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State officials believe they have stopped the devastating
glassy-winged sharpshooter short of the Northern California
grape-growing region that is the heart of the state's wine industry.</LD>
<LD>   Two years into the state's protracted battle against the pest, a
new report to the Legislature from state agriculture Secretary
William J. Lyons Jr. said that despite new infestations in the last
year, the $38-million battle is going better than most had hoped.</LD>
<LD>   In Northern California, the bug has been found only in isolated
places, none of them agricultural, Lyons said. Authorities also think
that they have successfully clamped down on the major route by which
the bug has been spreading since its discovery in Southern California
in 1999: unregulated shipments of nursery plants.</LD>
<TE>   The eradication effort ''has brought considerable resources and
expertise to bear against the glassy-winged sharpshooter and the
disease-carrying bacteria it spreads, and we've achieved marked
success,'' said Lyons in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   With wide areas of Southern California still infested, however,
officials said the battle will be a long one. ''We're only about two
years into a project that will probably take five to 10 years,'' said
Jay Van Rein, a spokesman for the California Department of Food and
Agriculture. ''But we've already done better than anyone expected us
to do.''</TE>
<TE>   Despite the optimistic tone of the report, some officials are
declining to declare victory.</TE>
<TE>   ''I don't feel content, because this has been working its way
north,'' said Assemblywoman Patricia Wiggins (D-Santa Rosa). ''It's
good news for Northern California that [the sharpshooter] hasn't
taken hold here. That doesn't mean it's not coming.''</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other pests that feed on fruit, the sharpshooter does its
damage by delivering a bacterium called Xylella fastidiosa that it
carries in its mouth. The bacterium causes Pierce's disease, which
clogs the water-carrying vessels in the plant, starving it of
nutrients. Though Pierce's disease has been around for more than a
century in California farm country, the arrival of the aggressive,
fast-moving glassy-winged sharpshooter from Mexico in 1994
supercharged its spread.</TE>
<TE>   The sharpshooter has been found throughout Southern California,
with satellite infestations in Butte, Contra Costa, Fresno,
Sacramento, Santa Clara and Tulare counties. The worst damage has
occurred in Temecula, where 1,000 acres of wine grapes have been
destroyed, costing growers $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   The only other large infestation in a farming region was in Kern
County, where the pest has invaded a 13,000-acre area at the base of
the Tehachapi Mountains. Farmers there have been pulling out infected
vines, using repellents and releasing wasps that eat sharpshooter
eggs.</TE>
<TE>   Because grapes are a $438-million business in Kern County, this
infestation has served as a kind of ''huge laboratory'' to test
eradication procedures.</TE>
<TE>   It is believed the pest spread north at least partly by
hitchhiking on ornamental plants shipped from Southern California
nurseries. In 2000, outbreaks were found in residential areas of
Fresno, Chico, Rancho Cordova and San Jose. As local officials
battled those, the state ordered a pervasive inspection program to
check plants at their shipping and destination points.</TE>

<LD>The sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, a religious order that has been
teaching and serving poor communities in California since 1851, will
celebrate its sesquicentennial March 9 at Our Lady of Sorrows parish,
121 E. Sola St., Santa Barbara.</LD>
<LD>   In the celebration, which will include a Mass of thanksgiving at
11 a.m., followed by a reception at noon, the sisters wish to thank
families, students, colleagues and supporters who have shared their
history. They invite friends and former students to come.</LD>
<LD>   The Notre Dame sisters came to Southern California in 1906, when
they established Dolores School for the elementary grades in Santa
Barbara, which later merged with Our Lady of Guadalupe School.</LD>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, Notre Dame nuns opened St. Columbkille's School on
South Main Street in 1923. Today, they serve there and at Nativity
parish and school near Vermont and Slauson avenues.</TE>

<HD>Kevin Smith, 38; Actor in 'Xena' Series</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Smith, a veteran New Zealand actor best known for his role as
Ares in the television series "Xena: Warrior Princess," has died. He
was 38.</LD>
<LD>   Newspapers in New Zealand reported that Smith died Feb. 15 in
Beijing from injuries suffered in a fall down several flights of
stairs on Feb. 6. He was in Beijing to shoot the U.S.-Chinese martial
arts film "Warriors of Virtue II."</LD>
<LD>   Smith worked mostly in his native country, but was preparing for
his first Hollywood role in the $70-million action film "Man of War,"
starring Bruce Willis. Filming was to start next month in Hawaii.</LD>
<TE>   Smith was born in Auckland, New Zealand. His family moved around
because of his father's naval career. Smith attended Timaru Boys High
School in Timaru, New Zealand, and Canterbury University in
Christchurch, New Zealand.</TE>
<TE>   He played professional rugby before injuries curtailed his career.
He also worked a series of odd jobs, including bank clerk and
furniture mover, before becoming an actor.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, he was a member of the New Zealand post-punk band
Say Yes to Apes.</TE>
<TE>   Smith starred in several plays and movies in his homeland. He also
appeared in two soap operas, "Gloss" and "Marlin Bay," which included
"Xena" star Lucy Lawless in the cast. Smith also appeared in the
series "Hercules."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Suzanne; and three sons, Oscar, 11;
Tyrone, 9; and Willard, 3.</TE>

<HD>Mormons' Temples Reflect Faith's Aura</HD>
<DH>Closed to outsiders, the architecturally interesting
buildings serve many functions unique to the church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN RIVERA</AU>
<BD>THE BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Winter Olympics visitors contemplate the primacy of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, they cannot help
but be drawn to the dominant architectural symbol of both the city
and the church: the Salt Lake Temple, with its six stately spires
reaching toward the heavens.</LD>
<LD>   In a church with a history and practice that spark curiosity and
often off-the-mark speculation, the Mormon temples around the world
are one of the religion's most intriguing features. They are
buildings so architecturally interesting that they can slow traffic.</LD>
<LD>   Adding to the intrigue is the fact that non-Mormons can never see
what goes on inside the temples. After construction of a temple is
completed, there is an open house, where anyone may visit and tour
the inside. Until Feb. 16, for example, tours of the faith's latest
temple were held in Snowflake, Ariz. But once a temple is dedicated,
only a card-carrying Mormon (and they do have cards) is admitted.</LD>
<TE>   Temples are not places where Mormons worship on a weekly basis. In
fact, all temples are closed on Sunday so members can attend services
in local meetinghouses as part of a ward, or congregation.</TE>
<TE>   Mormons perform only the most sacred rites of the church in their
grandiose buildings: eternal marriage of husband and wife, the
"sealing" of families to one another for eternity and proxy baptism
of one's ancestors.</TE>
<TE>   In each temple there is a reception desk, where Latter-day Saints,
as members of the church prefer to be called, present a card called a
"recommend," which attests that they are Mormons in good standing.
That standing is determined annually in an interview with the
president of the local ward, equivalent to the pastor of a local
congregation, and with the president of their stake, analogous to the
bishop of a diocese. These religious leaders are not theologically
trained clergy but laypeople who volunteer their services.</TE>
<TE>   In that interview, the church officials affirm that the member is
paying the required 10% tithe (of gross income), adhering to the
Mormon health code--which includes refraining from alcohol, tobacco
and stimulants such as caffeine--and wearing the sacred undergarments
required of members.</TE>
<TE>   (The sacred garments, which members receive at an "endowment"
ceremony that is analogous to a confirmation or bar mitzvah, have
several varieties, but a typical garment is a one-piece white cotton
or nylon undergarment with a V-neck and short sleeves. There are
sacred insignia sewn into four places, over the breasts, the navel
and the right knee.)</TE>
<TE>   After showing their card, the Latter-day Saints go to a locker
room to change into the white clothing (which they bring or rent at
the temple) that is required inside the sacred building.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the temple is not a cavernous building, like a cathedral,
but divided up into many rooms where the sacred rites, called
ordinances, are performed. There are usually several ordinance rooms,
where the endowment ceremonies are conducted, and several sealing
rooms, where husband and wife are sealed to each other for all
eternity. Families may also be sealed to one another for eternity,
which many converts, particularly those who have lost a family
member, mention as an appealing aspect of Mormonism. There is also
always one celestial room, the most sacred space in the temple, which
is for quiet contemplation.</TE>
<TE>   The eternal sealing of families is based on the Mormon belief that
each person once lived in a pre-mortal state, born of heavenly
parents, and comes to Earth to assume a physical body. A person who
lives by the moral requirements of the Gospel will once again return
to the presence of God to live as an eternal family.</TE>
<TE>   It is also a Mormon belief that those who never heard the Gospel
of Jesus Christ during their lives may be baptized by proxy and given
the opportunity to embrace it--or reject it--after death. These proxy
baptisms are performed in a large baptistery in the lower level of
the temple.</TE>
<TE>   It has been Mormon practice to scour census and other records to
compile lists of people for proxy baptisms. As Richard and Joan
Ostling point out in their 1999 book, "Mormon America," this activity
has caused some controversy. Proxy baptisms have been carried out for
U.S. presidents, signers of the Declaration of Independence and even
some Catholic saints.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the church's aggressive missionary efforts, it has
seen explosive growth. There were 1 million Mormons in 1947. Today
there are more than 11 million Mormons in the world, with one-seventh
living in Utah.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, Mormons were encouraged to move to Salt Lake City, or
Zion, as the church called it, and become part of the fold. Today
Mormons are encouraged to stay where they are. To help the church
come to them, temples are being built in every corner of the world.
As recently as 1991, temples outside Utah were rare. Now, there are
107 temples in the world, 55 of them outside of the United States.
Six of the last 10 temples dedicated are in foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   Under the leadership of 91-year-old President Gordon B. Hinckley,
the chief prophet and apostle of the church, Mormons have embarked on
an ambitious temple-building project, which he first announced in
1985 and which is helping to transform the church from a provincial
creed into an international religious force.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that no member of the church has received the ultimate
which this church has to give until he or she has received his or her
temple blessings in the house of the Lord," Hinckley told a
church-wide meeting in 1997. "Accordingly, we are doing all that we
know how to do to expedite the construction of these sacred buildings
and make the blessings received therein more generally available."</TE>

<HD>Navy Orders Tustin to Transfer Base Land to Santa Ana
Schools</HD>
<DH>Development: U.S. officials say they'll sell former
helicopter facility if deal isn't struck by Thursday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Navy has ordered Tustin to make a deal by Thursday to give
land at the Tustin helicopter base to two Santa Ana school districts,
or it will sell the base to developers and leave the city
empty-handed.</LD>
<LD>   In an ultimatum to Tustin Mayor Jeffery M. Thomas, Assistant
Secretary of the Navy H.T. Johnson rejected the city's claim that
handing over land to the Santa Ana schools would undermine the
financial success of its base redevelopment plan.</LD>
<LD>   Tustin wants to sell most of the 1,600-acre base to develop homes,
a golf course and businesses. The city has said it needs to sell the
property within the school districts' boundaries--planned for a
commercial center--to help pay for roads, a sewage system and other
infrastructure.</LD>
<TE>   Johnson, based in Washington, wrote in a Feb. 12 letter to Thomas
that the Navy will sell the property if Tustin can't make a deal with
the Santa Ana Unified and Rancho Santiago Community College districts
by Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is prepared immediately to ... request that the General
Services Administration undertake a public sale of all portions of
the installation not encumbered by [public uses]," Johnson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Developers already have lined up to buy portions of the property
from Tustin. Unlike its neighboring Marine base, El Toro, the Tustin
base is relatively free of contamination and could be developed more
easily.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin City Manager William A. Huston declined to discuss
Johnson's letter Friday, which he said was sent "in the context of
negotiations." The Navy hasn't yet approved Tustin's request to take
over the land.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident that the city and the Navy will be able to
reach an agreement," Huston said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana officials were privately jubilant and publicly low-key
about the letter, not wanting to jinx talks. Johnson's deputy, Duncan
Holaday, will be in Orange County on Monday to help seal a deal
between Tustin and the Santa Ana districts.</TE>
<TE>   John R. Hanna, president of the Rancho Santiago board of trustees,
said his district was close to agreement with Tustin, but was held up
by the city's unresolved issues with Santa Ana Unified.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably what it takes to get Tustin to wake up and smell
the coffee," Hanna said.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin has fought Santa Ana's demands for school space for eight
years. In 1994, Santa Ana Unified asked for 75 acres on the base, and
a coalition of schools--Rancho Santiago, Santa Ana Unified and the
South Orange County Community College District--asked for an
additional 100 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Those requests were accepted by the federal Department of
Education, but a new federal law changed the disposal process for
military bases. That led to a new plan by Tustin that eliminated the
Santa Ana land and gave 100 acres to the South County college
district.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Johnson said the Navy would honor the original
requests for land by the public agencies if Tustin's plan is rejected
and the property is sold by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Martin Burton, representing the Santa Ana districts, said
the deadline set by the Navy should end the impasse.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy has a job to do," he said. "They want to get this thing
settled and we do too."</TE>

<HD>Navy Tells Tustin to Give Schools Base Land</HD>
<DH>Development: U.S. officials say they'll sell former
helicopter facility if deal isn't struck with Santa Ana districts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Navy has ordered Tustin to make a deal by Thursday to give
land at the Tustin helicopter base to two Santa Ana school districts,
or it will sell the base to developers and leave the city
empty-handed.</LD>
<LD>   In an ultimatum to Tustin Mayor Jeffery M. Thomas, Assistant
Secretary of the Navy H.T. Johnson rejected the city's claim that
handing over land to the Santa Ana schools would undermine the
financial success of its base redevelopment plan.</LD>
<LD>   Tustin wants to sell most of the 1,600-acre base to develop homes,
a golf course and businesses.</LD>
<TE>   The city has said it needs to sell the property within the school
districts' boundaries--planned for a commercial center--to help pay
for roads, a sewage system and other infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, based in Washington, wrote in a Feb. 12 letter to Thomas
that the Navy will sell the property if Tustin can't make a deal with
the Santa Ana Unified and Rancho Santiago Community College districts
by Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy is prepared immediately to ... request that the General
Services Administration undertake a public sale of all portions of
the installation not encumbered by [public uses]," Johnson wrote.
Developers have lined up to buy portions of the property from Tustin.
Unlike its neighboring Marine base, El Toro, the Tustin base is
relatively free of contamination and could be developed more easily.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin City Manager William A. Huston declined to discuss
Johnson's letter Friday, which he said was sent "in the context of
negotiations." The Navy hasn't yet approved Tustin's request to take
over the land.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very confident that the city and the Navy will be able to
reach an agreement," Huston said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana officials were privately jubilant and publicly low-key
about the letter, not wanting to jinx talks. Johnson's deputy, Duncan
Holaday, will be in Orange County on Monday to help seal a deal
between Tustin and the Santa Ana districts.</TE>
<TE>   John R. Hanna, president of the Rancho Santiago board of trustees,
said his district was close to agreement with Tustin, but was held up
by the city's unresolved issues with Santa Ana Unified.</TE>
<TE>   "This is probably what it takes to get Tustin to wake up and smell
the coffee," Hanna said.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin has fought Santa Ana's demands for school space for eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Santa Ana Unified asked for 75 acres on the base, and a
coalition of schools--Rancho Santiago, Santa Ana Unified and the
South Orange County Community College District--asked for an
additional 100 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Those requests were accepted by the federal Department of
Education, but a new federal law changed the disposal process for
military bases. That led to a new plan by Tustin that eliminated the
Santa Ana land and gave 100 acres to the South County college
district.</TE>
<TE>   In his letter, Johnson said the Navy would honor the original
requests for land by the public agencies if Tustin's plan is rejected
and the property is sold by the federal government.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Gov. Gray Davis signed a bill approved by the
Legislature requiring Tustin to give 100 acres to the two Santa Ana
districts. The bill took effect Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Martin Burton, representing the Santa Ana districts, said
the deadline set by the Navy should end the impasse.</TE>

<HD>Virginia E. Hamilton, 65; Writer of Kids' Books Dealt With
Black Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Virginia Esther Hamilton often said that she wrote for "children and
their older allies" because it is in young minds that most change can
occur. In fact, Hamilton's vast body of work--35 books that spanned
many genres, which she termed "liberation literature"--added a new
dimension to American literature by treating the African American
experience as a mainstream facet of life.</LD>
<LD>   Hamilton died Tuesday in Dayton, Ohio, after a 10-year fight with
breast cancer. She was 65.</LD>
<LD>   Over the years, her works included picture books, novels, folk
stories, mysteries, science fiction and two biographies, which earned
her a number of major awards. In 1974, she became the first black
author to win the Newbery Medal, the most prestigious award in
American children's books, for "M.C. Higgins, the Great," a story
about a boy whose mountaintop home is threatened by strip mining. The
book also won the National Book Award.</LD>
<TE>   She was also given the Hans Christian Andersen Medal, the highest
honor for children's literature, and in 1995 became the first
children's author to receive a MacArthur Foundation "genius" grant.
Other awards include the Coretta Scott King Award, the Edgar Allan
Poe Award and the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal.</TE>
<TE>   "Language is magic," reads a quote from her posted on her Web
site. "It has always been magic, since the time sorcerers uttered
their incantations and wrote their symbols, which steeped our human
past in marvelous myth. Oh, I am a believer in language and its magic
monarchy! To bind its boundless spell to me is why I write."</TE>
<TE>   A contemporary pioneer of African American literature, Hamilton
often drew upon her heritage, her love of history and the many
stories handed to her by the adults in her life."She never itched to
write for her peers," said her husband, poet Arnold Adoff, in a
telephone interview from the couple's Yellow Springs, Ohio, home.
"She was totally committed to writing for children in the hopes that
their minds would be the most open. She said her age group was 8 to
80, and why not? She never shied away from a topic. All of her issues
were adult."</TE>
<TE>   Lauded as a 'National Treasure'</TE>
<TE>   Her first book, "Zeely," published in 1967, is the story of a
young girl who fantasizes that a tall, majestic woman in her town is
an African queen and later finds out she really is. The book was most
notable because of what it lacked thematically: the urban integration
struggle of blacks, which permeated African American fiction at the
time. For this reason, Carol Fiore, the president of the children's
division of the American Library Assn., called Hamilton a "national
treasure."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a combination of things that made her so brilliant," Fiore
said. "While her characters were African American, they were human
beings. Their experience went beyond the black experience. They were
experiences that all children and all families have, and by telling
us those stories we can understand all people so much better."</TE>
<TE>   Children in the 1940s were not typically educated about the
contributions of blacks to literature, but Hamilton--who grew up
listening to her parents' storytelling and the black press editorials
her father read out loud--began learning on her own. The youngest of
five children, Hamilton was born on a small farm in Yellow Springs.
Her father and mother were avid readers and storytellers who infused
her with their enthusiasm for words. Hamilton read piles of comics
her brothers kept and books she borrowed from the library, family and
friends. And she took plenty of notes. Hamilton attended Antioch
College and Ohio State University, where she majored in writing.
Encouraged by her professors to move to New York to become an author,
Hamilton enrolled in a course at the New School for Social Research.
As she waited for her works to be published, Hamilton took on a
series of jobs, including museum receptionist, bookkeeper and
nightclub singer. She met Adoff, who is Jewish, in 1958 and married
him in 1960 "when that was illegal in 28 states," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "She wanted to be on the shelf with Faulkner as well as with
Richard Wright and Toni Morrison," Adoff said. "The point was to be
the best and never allow anyone to make you less for any reason."</TE>
<TE>   After establishing her writing career in New York, Hamilton and
Adoff moved to her parents' land in 1969 and built a house where they
could raise their two children and continue writing.</TE>
<TE>   She excelled at recasting ancient tales to appeal to children,
said her longtime editor Bonnie Verburg. "One of the things that is
highly unusual in Virginia's work is that she has been able to
combine master storytelling and a remarkable ear for spoken language
with scholarly research," Verburg said. "So you have this magnificent
researcher who at the same time has a great ear for dialogue and the
spoken word. She was able to find stories that had been buried and
disappeared since the Civil War. She would dig them out, and what
excitement when she found them!"</TE>
<TE>   She wrote her manuscripts on a manual typewriter, refusing to move
up to an electric model, until she caved in and bought a computer,
her husband said. She became so "high-tech," she learned how to play
computer games, blasted Alicia Keys songs through the computer's
speakers and even learned Swahili online.</TE>
<TE>   As prolific as Hamilton was--completing 15 books in the 10 years
she was ill--her family always came first.</TE>
<TE>   Adeptly Balanced Family, Writing</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't have to make any deals with the devil to write," Adoff
said. "She was a true genius in the absolute and deepest and most
complex sense of the word. She understood family and the psychology
of children and a husband who was a poet and all the nutty stuff that
that entails. Whatever face of the prism she was looking through, she
was always in complete control. She did not sacrifice anything to
make her art."</TE>
<TE>   Her latest book, "Time Pieces," a semiautobiographical novel for
middle-schoolers, will be published in October by Blue Sky Press, an
imprint of Scholastic.</TE>
<TE>   She also left behind a handful of picture books that Adoff hopes
to have published in the coming years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Adoff, Hamilton is survived by a daughter, Leigh
Hamilton Adoff, of Berlin; son, Jaime Levi Adoff, of New York; two
sisters, Nina Anthony of Columbus, Ohio, and Barbara Davis of Los
Angeles; and two brothers, William Hamilton of Englewood, N.J., and
Kenneth James Hamilton of Chula Vista.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, her family is requesting that donations be
sent to the American Cancer Society or the Virginia Hamilton
Conference on Multicultural Children's Literature at Kent State
University in Ohio.</TE>

<HD>Sanitation Officials Will Add Bleach to Ocean-Bound Waste</HD>
<DH>Environment: Plume of sewage near Newport Pier prompts
action. Critics fear chemical could harm sea life.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sanitation officials plan to add 12,000 gallons of bleach a day to
the sewage that goes into the ocean off Huntington Beach, after
finding that bacteria and other disease-causing substances were
coming close to shore.</LD>
<LD>   Some authorities hailed the move, saying it would clean virtually
all the bacteria flowing into the ocean, but environmentalists said
it could endanger sea life.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to be polluting the ocean habitat with chlorine to
solve their past sins? Unacceptable," said Bob Caustin, founder of
Defend the Bay.</LD>
<TE>   But officials with the Orange County Sanitation District said
Friday they will work carefully to prevent environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   Sewage is discharged 41/2 miles from shore. But a plume of sewage
spotted near Newport Pier, a half-mile from shore, prompted the move,
said Blake Anderson, the district's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision ... is being made in the best interest[s] of the
community we serve," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 11, tests showed the plume on the surface of the ocean
three miles offshore. Two miles offshore, the plume was 15 feet below
the ocean's surface. Less than a half-mile off Newport Beach, it was
45 feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, that's getting a little too close for comfort," Anderson
said.</TE>
<TE>   In 90 days, the district plans to start adding 12,000 gallons of
bleach daily to the 243 million gallons of sewage it pumps into its
ocean outfall pipe. Half of that sewage receives only primary
treatment; the district has a waiver from the state and U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency that allows it to release the
less-treated sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The bleach is three times stronger than the household variety. The
chemical will cost $5 million annually, and other expenses are
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Bleach will be used as a temporary measure until the district
settles on a more permanent disinfection treatment, probably using
ultra-fine filters, Anderson said. That will take years, he added.
The district has never used chlorine.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we have not employed chorine disinfection is our
concern for the environment and the animals that live at the end of
our outfall," Anderson said. But according to the district, the plan
is to use levels so low, the chlorine would break down before it
reaches the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Regulatory officials with the EPA and the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board said chlorine use is common in California, and
it can be done with minimal harm to the environment if done right.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County uses chlorine on sewage discharged into the
ocean, but plans to stop after its new treatment facility is built
later this year.</TE>

<HD>Plant in Surf City to Bleach Waste</HD>
<DH>Environment: Plume of sewage off Newport spurs O.C.
Sanitation District action. Critics fear chemical could harm sea
life. Officials call procedure safe.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Sanitation officials plan to add 12,000 gallons of bleach a day to
the sewage that goes into the ocean off Huntington Beach, after
finding that bacteria and other disease-causing substances were
coming close to shore.</LD>
<LD>   Some authorities hailed the move, saying it would clean virtually
all the bacteria flowing into the ocean, but environmentalists said
it could endanger sea life.</LD>
<LD>   "They're going to be polluting the ocean habitat with chlorine to
solve their past sins? Unacceptable," said Bob Caustin, founder of
Defend the Bay.</LD>
<TE>   But officials with the Orange County Sanitation District said
Friday they will work carefully to prevent environmental damage.</TE>
<TE>   Sewage is discharged 41/2 miles from shore. But a plume of sewage
spotted near Newport Pier, a half-mile from shore, prompted the move,
said Blake Anderson, the district's general manager.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision ... is being made in the best interest[s] of the
community we serve," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 11, tests showed the plume on the surface of the ocean
three miles offshore. Two miles offshore, the plume was 15 feet below
the ocean's surface. Less than 1/2-mile off Newport Beach, it was 45
feet deep.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankly, that's getting a little too close for comfort," Anderson
said.</TE>
<TE>   In 90 days, the district plans to start adding 12,000 gallons of
bleach daily to the 243 million gallons of sewage it pumps into its
ocean outfall pipe.</TE>
<TE>   Half of that sewage receives only primary treatment; the district
has a waiver from the state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
that allows it to release the less-treated sewage.</TE>
<TE>   The bleach is three times stronger than the household variety, but
safer than chlorine, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   The chemical will cost $5 million annually, and other expenses are
unknown. Bleach will be used as a temporary measure until the
district settles on a more permanent disinfection treatment, probably
using ultra-fine filters, Anderson said. That will take years, he
added. The district has never used chlorine.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we have not employed chorine disinfection is our
concern for the environment and the animals that live at the end of
our outfall," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   But according to the district, the plan is to use levels so low,
the chlorine would break down before it reaches the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Regulatory officials with the EPA and the Santa Ana Regional Water
Quality Control Board said chlorine use is common in California, and
it can be done with minimal harm to the environment if done right.
Los Angeles County uses chlorine on sewage discharged into the ocean,
but plans to stop after its new treatment facility is built later
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Chlorine Is Toxic but Manageable, Some Say</TE>
<TE>   "One of the negative consequences related to chlorine is you have
to make sure all of the chlorine is removed before it is discharged
because of potential toxicity in the environment," said Kurt
Berchtold, assistant executive officer for the regional board, a
state agency. "Chlorine is very toxic to marine life but ... if
managed correctly, the chlorine would probably be used up before it
made it out" to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Both the federal and state water agencies will review the plans,
and possibly require more testing to ensure the chlorine isn't
harming the environment.</TE>
<TE>   An EPA official said Friday that the addition of chlorine may make
it politically easier for the district to renew its waiver to send
out the partially treated sewage. The district is the largest of 36
agencies nationwide to hold such a waiver, which expires next year.
Environmentalists and a state lawmaker have been working against
allowing the district to renew that waiver.</TE>
<TE>   But Terry Fleming, an environmental scientist in EPA's San
Francisco office who oversees the sanitation district, said the
chlorine treatment eliminates one problem: the district no longer
will be sending out sewage with disease-causing bacteria. He expects
to see an increase in toxic byproducts in the sewage, but said
dilution should stop adverse impacts.</TE>
<TE>   Critics dismissed the disinfection announcement as a political
move to help the district renew its waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Four city councils have opposed renewal, and Assemblyman Ken
Maddox introduced a bill last week that would kill the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox, R-Garden Grove, said Friday he believes the bill, along
with the environmentalists' campaign, prompted the sewage agency's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists also pointed out that the sanitation district
has known for 15 years that the plume was coming within 1/2-mile of
Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Accusations and Denials of Political Motivations</TE>
<TE>   "They've known since 1987, and now they're finally going to try
and give the public some protection?" Caustin asked. However, he
added, "This is tantamount to an admission that they are polluting,
which is a step in the right direction. Admission is the first [step]
toward recovery."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the district general manager, bristled at the suggestion
the decision to add chlorine was politically motivated. "That's a
cynical view and I would reject that."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said that in past studies, his agency has not seen the
plume at such shallow depths so close to shore.</TE>
<TE>   Joey Racano, a member of the environmental organization the Ocean
Outfall Group, said the sanitation district is still treating the
ocean as if it were a toilet bowl, only now the district is adding
bleach before flushing. "It's very important that we put the emphasis
on purification as opposed to sterilization," he said.</TE>

<LD>Families frolicked on the beaches. Dads sneaked out of work early to
play a round of golf. And kids ran to swimming pools to splash in the
cool water.</LD>
<LD>   The calendar may say winter but the temperature gauge in Southern
California is definitely pointing toward summer.</LD>
<LD>   In Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange counties, the unseasonably warm
weather Friday broke temperature records, prompting sun-loving
Southern Californians to find any excuse to get outside.</LD>
<TE>   At a time of year when most people would be huddled inside to
avoid winter rains, dozens of mothers with young children flocked to
beaches with pails, shovels, and in at least one instance, borrowed
summer beach clothes.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco resident Ruth Wilford, visiting her stepmother in
Ventura with her daughter Jessica, said the warm weather caught her
by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "We packed all our cold-weather stuff," Wilford said as she sat on
a fold-up chair near Ventura Beach reading a paperback and wearing a
T-shirt and sandals borrowed from her stepmother, Marvis Gleerup.</TE>
<TE>   The warm weather broke records Friday in Yorba Linda, where the
mercury reached 91 degrees, surpassing the record of 85 in 1961.
Santa Ana recorded a high of 93 degrees, breaking its record of 87 in
1995. Downtown Los Angeles reached 90 degrees, eclipsing the previous
high of 86 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures in Chatsworth reached 90 degrees, edging out the
previous high of 88 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Ventura hit 85 degrees, breaking its record of 82 back
in 1990. Oxnard saw a high of 89, edging out its record of 87 in
1954. Simi Valley also hit 89, breaking its record of 86 in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   ''There was a combination of strong high pressure, light offshore
winds and sunny skies that caused the heat,'' said Bruce Rockwell, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. ''Tomorrow
should be 10 to 15 degrees cooler.''</TE>
<TE>   Despite the predicted cooling trend, "you're gonna stay hot for a
bit," said Eric Edge, a forecaster with Weather Central Inc., which
provides forecasting services for The Times. "You have yourselves a
summer in wintertime."</TE>
<TE>   More summer weather will likely draw even more people outside in
the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   More than 3,000 people flocked to Ventura city beaches Friday,
said Brian Ketterer, a supervising lifeguard for the state Department
of Parks and Recreation based in Ventura. Fewer than 2,000 people
come to the beach on a normal winter day, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden heat wave forced Ketterer to call in as many of the 56
on-call lifeguards as possible for the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   ''You call in people as best you can,'' Ketterer said. ''This
caught us totally off-guard.''</TE>
<TE>   Lifeguards, swimming pool attendants and golf pros throughout the
region reported unusually big crowds enjoying the sunny weather.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the temperature was in the high 80s Friday afternoon,
Sharon Hillenbrand of Northridge dressed her 4-year-old daughter Lucy
in boots and mittens.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy, who attends the Magic Years Nursery School in Reseda,
frolicked in a yard covered with snow. She carried snowballs in her
red mittens and rode down a snow-covered straw hill on a plastic
sled.</TE>
<TE>   For seven years the school has had 16 tons of snow delivered each
February. But on Friday school officials didn't expect the weather to
feel like summer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best place to be when it's this hot outside,"
Hillenbrand said. "What a Southern California way to do it."</TE>

<HD>As GOP Primary Looms, Riordan Feels the Heat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever since the White House urged him to run, gubernatorial hopeful
Richard Riordan has touted himself--in the words of his latest TV ad--as
the Republican Gray Davis fears the most.</LD>
<LD>   But that strategy of looking past his GOP opponents to the November
election has always been a risky one. Now, analysts of all persuasions
agree that it could end up keeping a Riordan-Davis matchup from ever
taking place.</LD>
<LD>   In the past few weeks, Riordan has seen his commanding lead in the
March 5 primary shrivel under the onslaught of Davis and Republican
rivals Bill Jones and Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly--as even anxious Riordan strategists concede--the contest has
become a real race.</TE>
<TE>   The two-front fight has caused the former Los Angeles mayor to abandon
his high-road campaign and may force Riordan, against his will, to dip
into his personal fortune to stay competitive on the television airwaves.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, having quietly consolidated the conservative Republican base,
is not only climbing in opinion polls but has more than twice the
campaign cash on hand as Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   That edge is significant as the campaign, long simmering out of sight,
heats up in its final 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   With Simon's surge comes heightened scrutiny. On Friday, the
businessman and political neophyte was hit with a Sacramento Bee story
revealing his registration as a political independent when he lived in
New York in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation is particularly embarrassing for Simon, who has a new
ad attacking Riordan's party credentials and who repeatedly bills himself
as the one true conservative in the GOP race.</TE>
<TE>   Simon brushed aside the matter at a Friday afternoon stop in Los
Angeles. "I've been a proud Republican for many years and that's all I'm
going to say about that," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   It was a rare moment on the defensive for the fledgling candidate, who
preferred to talk about his plan to create a state "cyber-terrorism" unit
to monitor public and private security efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, though, it is Riordan who has been twisted about through the
campaign, as he tries to hold onto his Republican support without
abandoning the centrist positions that, theoretically, give him his best
shot at beating Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The governor, with his massive campaign bankroll, has played no small
part in Riordan's dilemma. Davis has spent a remarkable $8 million on
campaign ads so far--most of them assailing Riordan--even though Davis is
running essentially unopposed in the Democratic primary.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the governor has sought to pick his preferred opponent for
November. The conventional thinking is that Simon or Jones, who have a
conservative stance on issues such as abortion, immigration and the
environment, would be easier to beat in the general election than the
more moderate Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Should he fail in that bit of meddling, Davis at least has managed to
scuff up Riordan's image by portraying him as someone who flip-flops on
issues and--brazenly appropriating the words former Republican Gov.
George Deukmejian used to criticize Riordan--"tries to be all things to
all people."</TE>
<TE>   But Davis' advertising alone is not responsible for Riordan's
difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-mayor's strategy has largely employed a single tactic:
appealing to Republican voters by focusing on his asserted ability to
beat Davis. Partisan primaries, however, tend to draw the most
ideological voters, the kind who often would rather suffer defeat than
compromise their beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick made a decision early on to target his message toward those
voters who Republicans have been losing in the last few general election
campaigns," said Dan Schnur, a longtime GOP strategist who provided
advice to Riordan last summer, before his formal entrance into the race.
"In doing so, he may have provided an opening for a conservative
challenge."</TE>
<TE>   To take one emotional example, Riordan has said repeatedly that the
party should set aside its anti-abortion doctrine for the sake of
appealing to voters who view Republicans as intolerant.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan sounded the note again Friday as he campaigned in Palm
Springs. "I like him," he said of Simon, "but he can't be elected. . . .
He's pro-life, but he will not respect people who are pro-choice."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from abortion, Riordan has also broken with the party orthodoxy
on gay rights, immigration, gun control and providing state-funded health
care to the poor, among other issues.</TE>
<TE>   While those stands could position Riordan well for a general election,
given the relatively moderate stance of most California voters, he has
antagonized many GOP activists. That has provided an opening for Simon
and, to a lesser extent, Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "You have people saying, 'I can disagree with someone on 'x,' but I'd
still vote for him because I want to win,' " said Arnold Steinberg, who
advised Riordan during his years as mayor but is sitting out the
gubernatorial contest.</TE>
<TE>   In Riordan's case, Steinberg went on, "it's not any one issue, but a
whole array of issues. The campaign emphasizes inclusiveness but seems
insufficiently inclusive of Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   As the poorest of the candidates--able to wage only a meager
advertising campaign--Jones has capitalized the least on Riordan's
slippage.</TE>
<TE>   He continued his hand-to-mouth campaigning Friday in Goleta, where he
scoffed at the former mayor's pledge not to meet with lobbyists if
elected governor.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said that before Riordan took office in 1993, his law firm gave
money to city and county officials while bidding for government
contracts. He compared it to Davis' approach to governing. "The
check-writing concept is not acceptable as a method of conducting
business in California," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Riordan had a light day of campaigning. He golfed,
raised money and greeted passersby on Palm Springs' main shopping strip.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed by reporters, he defended his attacks on Simon, a friend and
fellow church parishioner, after months of insisting he would stick to
issues and avoid negativity.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon was attacking me for all kinds of things that were just
not correct, so we're giving a little back at him," Riordan said. ". . .
After trying to be Mr. Goody-Good-Shoes, he started to paint me as things
I'm not." Privately, Riordan strategists said there were more anti-Simon
attacks to come--the clearest sign that victory on March 5, and the
much-anticipated Riordan-Davis matchup, was something they no longer take
for granted.</TE>
<TE>   Even Riordan seemed a bit chastened Friday. Normally happy-go-lucky,
he lamented the campaign's bitter turn. Asked if he was enjoying himself,
he replied: "I haven't had so much fun since my dog died."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Debating Wider Assault on Colombia Rebels</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Officials point to link between guerrillas and
Libya. Military role would test Congress' support for campaign against
terror.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Alarmed by signs of weapons traffic between Colombian rebels and
the Middle East, the Bush administration is weighing a proposal to
declare the destruction of leftist guerrillas in the South American
country an explicit goal of U.S. policy.</LD>
<LD>   Some senior officials are also pushing for the administration to
assert, for the first time, that the Colombian rebels are a specific
target of the worldwide U.S. war on terrorism, administration officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   Such declarations would mark a significant toughening of U.S. policy
and pose an important test of how much leeway Congress will grant
President Bush to expand military operations around the world in the
post-Sept. 11 era.</LD>
<TE>   For six years, Congress has strictly limited the U.S. military mission
in Colombia, fearing that if the anti-drug campaign escalated to a
broader fight against insurgents, the United States could sink into a
costly quagmire with echoes of Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal law and presidential directive, U.S. military assistance
in the country's 38-year-old conflict has been generally limited to
support for the Colombian government's counter-narcotics activities. The
250 U.S. troops there are barred from a combat role.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as rebels have stepped up attacks in recent months, administration
officials have come to the view that only sharply increased military
pressure--with U.S. backing--can force the large and well-financed rebel
forces to the negotiating table. This week, Colombian President Andres
Pastrana broke off talks with the guerrillas, and the Colombian army
moved Friday to take over a zone ceded to the rebels three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The administration officials argue that the United States should seek
to foster Colombian democracy and that the collapse of the Colombian
government would risk violence and turmoil throughout a strategic,
oil-producing corner of the hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to underscore the security risks posed by the rebels,
officials pointed this week to classified reports indicating that crudely
manufactured mortars used in Libya have been found in the hands of
Colombian rebels.</TE>
<TE>   These weapons, made out of natural-gas canisters, fire conventional
shells but have also been used to bombard targets with unconventional
materials, including excrement. Used that way, they can spread contagion,
and become a kind of cheap and frightening biological weapon, according
to U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels are among the largest and best-funded insurgent groups in
the world. They earn hundreds of millions of dollars from drug traffic as
well as kidnapping and extortion operations.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Shifter, an expert on Colombia at the Inter-American Dialogue
research organization in Washington, said it would be a "radical
departure" for the administration to commit itself to destroying the
rebel organization, or even to making it an official target of the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that Bush had excluded the Colombian insurgents last fall
when he defined the war's object as terrorist groups with "global reach."</TE>
<TE>   Declaring the rebels part of the broader terrorism war would probably
bring still more money and resources to the battle and give the problem
more high-level attention in Washington. It would reflect the
administration's view that the insurgents are a threat beyond Colombia's
borders and could spread instability to neighboring Venezuela, a major
oil producer, Bolivia, Ecuador and Panama.</TE>
<TE>   It would also make the U.S.-led war on terrorism appear broader than a
campaign against only Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   Shifter said there have been past reports of contacts and arms traffic
between the Colombian rebels and Middle Eastern groups, although none, as
far as he knew, came from official sources. He said he had been skeptical
of the reports because the rebels are "provincials" without wide contacts
abroad. Yet he added, "I wouldn't be shocked" if the reports were true.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, several suspected Irish Republican Army militants were
arrested in Colombia and charged with helping the guerrillas there.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has been searching for a tougher line on
Colombia, and an intense internal debate rages over how far the
administration should go in reshaping what has been a strictly
anti-narcotics campaign.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the administration formally requested as part of its 2003
budget $98 million to train a new Colombian brigade to protect the Cano
Limon oil pipeline, which is operated by Occidental Petroleum of Los
Angeles. U.S. officials are also seeking permission to give the Colombian
government new intelligence information to help it locate rebel forces,
as well as additional spare parts for its military.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. defense officials said this week that they expect the
military mission to be expanded far beyond protecting a single pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   They predicted that the new brigade will protect other parts of the
infrastructure that have been a target of rebel attacks, including roads,
bridges and electric power installations. The overriding purpose is to
protect or reclaim territory so that the Colombian government can assert
its sovereignty, one defense official said.</TE>
<TE>   And although U.S. troops are barred from combat, defense officials
believe that American advisors will be allowed for the first time to
accompany Colombian troops in firefights to help guide their activities,
defense officials said. Despite their increased proficiency, the
Colombian troops "lack self-confidence," said a defense official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   In the debate over the policy, the State Department and National
Security Council are urging a cautious approach, while the Pentagon is
arguing for a more assertive stance.</TE>
<TE>   A senior State Department official said in an interview that the
request for aid to protect the pipeline marked a "big step forward." Yet
the official sought to make clear that, from the department's point of
view, the mission should still be strictly limited.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to make too big a deal of this," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony this month, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell struck the
same note, saying the new military mission would be a "passive" one, in
which the U.S. forces would try to deter attacks but not search the
jungle for the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional critics of U.S. involvement in the conflict have
succeeded in restricting the American mission, beginning, notably, with
an amendment proposed by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   But critics and supporters alike acknowledge that a tougher U.S.
approach has won converts in light of the Sept. 11 attacks and the
changing attitude of Colombians toward the war. As the rebels have
carried out a string of kidnappings and bombings that have hurt civilians
and soldiers alike, more Colombians have urged a harder line.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say they intend to fashion their new policy
in consultation with lawmakers and believe that they can build wide
support on Capitol Hill if they have a chance to present their views.</TE>
<TE>   "There has not been a real discussion on Capitol Hill on Colombia for
three years," said Roger Pardo-Maurer IV, the Pentagon's top official in
Western Hemisphere affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say they don't believe that the Colombian
army can end the war with a military victory. But increased military
force can build the pressure on the rebels, convincing them to negotiate,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the rebels have not been serious about peace talks because
they don't believe that they are truly threatened by the government, U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Pardo-Maurer said a well-known rebel leader from the Central American
wars of the 1980s acknowledged that the decision to negotiate is all
about calculations of the balance of power. He said that onetime
Salvadoran guerrilla leader Joaquin Villalobos believed that cease-fires
came about "not through trust, but through a correlation of forces."</TE>

<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>The Russian president called the Winter Olympics "a flop." The head
of Russia's church called it unfair. And a leading politician complained
that Russia's athletes have been robbed "in broad daylight, arrogantly,
boorishly, insolently and cynically."</LD>
<LD>   As the ice wars played out, Russians stayed up late and fumed in front
of their television sets.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian ice hockey team was taking on the United States in what
was widely seen as a grudge match recalling the famous 1980 face-off
between Cold War foes. The Americans won then, and they won again Friday,
3-2.</LD>
<TE>   The stinging loss added insult to hurt pride, as accusations of
anti-Russian bias at the Games sweep the country. For a while, it looked
as if Russia might even pull its athletes from the rest of the
competition and boycott the closing ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until late Friday that Guennadi Shvets, a spokesman for the
Russian Olympic delegation, put those fears to rest, announcing, "We will
stay at the Games."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, Russian President Vladimir V. Putin said, "Several
things [at the Games] evoke astonishment, speaking mildly." His spokesman
and the Russian parliament called for the boycott.</TE>
<TE>   Putin, normally restrained and cool, lashed out at the International
Olympic Committee leaders elected in July, pressuring them to act more
forcefully in defending Russian athletes against perceived bias.</TE>
<TE>   "Their passive stance astonishes me," said Putin, who is an
enthusiastic downhill skier.</TE>
<TE>   And commenting on the abundance of National Hockey League referees in
the Games, he said, "Northern American athletes receive a clear
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Russian Olympic officials first threatened to pull out of the Games on
Thursday after a star cross-country skier, Larissa Lazutina, was
disqualified; a drug test had indicated a high level of blood hemoglobin,
which Russian officials attributed to Lazutina's menstrual cycle, not
doping.</TE>
<TE>   That controversy came on the heels of last week's decision to award a
second set of gold medals to two Canadian figure skaters amid reports of
judging misconduct. This was seen as a deep humiliation for the original
gold medalists, Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, and
many here believe it fanned ill will over later judging decisions that
went against the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, Russia filed a protest with the International Skating
Union after figure skater Irina Slutskaya narrowly lost a gold medal to
American Sarah Hughes, an outcome seen as robbery by Russian spectators.
Demands from Russian Olympic officials that Slutskaya, too, be awarded
gold were rejected in less than 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Putin said Russia should see out the competition. "Let's
see how the Olympics end. Let us hope that the IOC leadership will manage
to resolve these difficulties," he told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to placate Putin backfired when the Russian leader took
umbrage at a letter from IOC President Jacques Rogge, which said all the
judges' decisions were correct.</TE>
<TE>   The letter, delivered via the State Department, contained a blunder,
which the presidential spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, exposed during a
live program on the national NTV network.</TE>
<TE>   "The letter is addressed to Mr. A. Putin!" he said, holding the letter
up to jeers from a studio audience. "So I would like to say to Mr. Rogge
that if he had the misfortune of ending up at the head of IOC and thus
got into big politics, then before sending a letter to a head of state,
it wouldn't hurt to learn that he is not Antoine nor Andre but Vladimir."</TE>
<TE>   He said the letter symbolized the scornful attitude many foreign
bureaucrats and sports organizations have developed toward Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "We are being treated now differently from the way we were treated in
the past," Yastrzhembsky complained. "At least they were afraid of us
then. And they were afraid to mess with us."</TE>
<TE>   Complaints about the judging came from the patriarch of the Russian
Orthodox Church, Alexy II, from captains of industry and from ordinary
Russians who vowed to march on the Canadian Embassy today.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Rogozin, head of the Duma foreign affairs committee, captured
the national mood in a phone interview with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is fuming and boiling now. The public anger against the
U.S.A. is now the worst it has been in years. Every Russian citizen is
holding a deep grudge against America now. How would you feel after they
robbed you of your victory in broad daylight arrogantly, boorishly,
insolently and cynically?" he complained.</TE>
<TE>   Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman, acknowledged that part of
the problem was Russia's economic difficulties and declining state
investment in sports.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Tikhonov, a renowned former Soviet hockey coach of gold
medal-winning teams, said in a telephone interview that government
indifference to athletics is to blame for the Russians' low medal count
in sports they once dominated.</TE>
<TE>   "We have now come to the point where we are eating up the last crumbs
of success planted back in the Soviet times. And it hurts very much when
even these crumbs are stolen from us, as happened more than once in Salt
Lake City."</TE>
<TE>   He said that after the Soviet Union fell, the infrastructure of sports
schools and training centers began to crumble, but no one cared because
athletes were still bringing in medals.</TE>
<TE>   Political analyst Andrei Piontkovsky of the Independent Institute for
Strategic Studies, a Moscow-based think tank, said the scandal was
unlikely to harm relations between Russia and the U.S. He expressed
surprise at Putin's remarks.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the smartest statement our president ever made. It is a
pity that the president allowed himself to be involved in this
controversy where the Russian sports officials are trying to cover
obvious shortcomings in their own work by accusing the Games judges and
organizers," he said. "This painful hysteria reflects the very sick state
of the Russian political environment now."</TE>
<TE>   With the flare-up over Russian perceptions of bias, the pressure was
on the Russian team going into the ice hockey game against the Americans
on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   As the match approached, former Russian hockey champs involved in the
1980 showdown said Russian pride was as much at stake in Friday's game as
it was then.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Krutov, 41, who played in the 1980 game, said memories of the
loss still bring pain.</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's showdown, he spoke of the pressure the athletes face.
"Each of them must realize that they are playing not an ordinary game,
but are defending the pride of their own country. If the Russians win
this game, it will mean that the entire Russian Olympic team has won.
That Russia has won. If we lose, it will mean that the entire country is
defeated."</TE>

<HD>Tribes Benefit in Campaign Bill</HD>
<DH>Politics: Indians would be able to take advantage of the reform
measure's hard money loophole.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Mashantucket Pequot Nation, a small Indian tribe that owns a
mega-casino in Connecticut, knows how to make itself heard in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   The tribe gave about $500,000 in national political donations during
the 2000 campaign, more than any other Native American group in the
country.</LD>
<LD>   And, in theory, it could approach that total again in 2004, even if
Congress passes legislation to crack down on big political donations from
special interests and wealthy individuals.</LD>
<TE>   That's because Indian tribes, including many politically active ones
in California, are among the unheralded beneficiaries of potential
loopholes in the reform bill, which faces a crucial test soon in the
Senate before it can be sent to President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would ban soft money--unlimited, loosely regulated
contributions to national political parties--from all donors, including
Indians. But it eases some restrictions on hard money donations--sums
that may be given directly to congressional and presidential candidates,
as well as parties.</TE>
<TE>   Indian tribes, though, are part of a small category of donors that
would not have to abide by an overall cap on these hard money
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, while the typical individual could give the new maximum
donation of $2,000 to a relatively small number of federal candidates,
tribes could funnel contributions of this size to as many candidates as
they want--potentially hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Few expect that any tribe would go that far. But in a new fund-raising
world, with most soft money off limits, the two major parties would
redouble their chase for hard money. And groups such as Indian tribes
that can give large chunks of that precious funding source would likely
gain influence.</TE>
<TE>   This potential loophole is one of several in the legislation, which
advocates acknowledge is more likely to rearrange rather than reduce the
flow of money in politics.</TE>
<TE>   Another would let incorporated groups, such as the National Rifle
Assn. or the Sierra Club, pour unlimited funds into preelection political
attacks through media other than television. The bill also would
encourage state and local parties, acting as proxies for their national
counterparts, to solicit from deep-pocket donors.</TE>
<TE>   These provisions underscore the limits of a bill that seeks to
overhaul federal campaign law for the first time in nearly 30 years.
Political pros are already combing through the fine print to find what
could be exploited if the measure becomes law.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll do anything that's legal," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis of
Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
"We'll raise hard money. We'll raise soft money [where possible]. We'll
raise Indian gaming money."</TE>
<TE>Votes Nearly There to End Any Filibuster</TE>
<TE>   Next week, advocates of a House-passed campaign finance measure will
press the Senate to send it to the president. The pro-reform coalition of
Democrats and a small bloc of Republicans appears close to having the 60
votes needed to overcome a possible Senate filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Most congressional Republicans oppose the legislation, criticizing it
as an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. But a major reason
why Bush may embrace the bill is that it actually expands certain forms
of fund-raising in which his party excels.</TE>
<TE>   Under the bill, donors would no longer be able to give unlimited sums
of soft money to the national parties for such activities as voter
turnout drives and "issue" advertisements, which typically tout or attack
candidates without directly soliciting votes. Such money totaled nearly
$500 million in the last election cycle, split about equally between
Republicans and Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   In a compromise to win backing for a soft money ban, the legislation
would allow individuals to give up to $95,000 every two years to parties
and candidates. These hard money donations, which Republicans
historically have raised in far larger quantities than Democrats, may be
spent on direct election expenses. Currently, the limit is $50,000.</TE>
<TE>   But the legislation leaves untouched a federal rule that would exempt
Indian tribes and certain other donors from the proposed $95,000 limit.</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, the Federal Election Commission found that tribal
entities, like unincorporated partnerships and homeowner associations,
were subject to some contribution limits but not others.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line: Under the pending legislation, tribes could no longer
give soft money to the national parties and would have to abide by a
$2,000 limit in hard money donations per election to any federal
candidate. But the tribes would be able to give to as many candidates as
they choose, while others would have to stop after they hit the $95,000
limit.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, that means a tribe could give the maximum amount to every
candidate for the House, Senate and White House--$2,000 for primary
elections and $2,000 for the general elections--totaling hundreds of
thousands of dollars in each election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   The exception is potentially important because tribes have gained in
wealth and political clout in recent years as the Indian casino industry
has grown, and questions about gambling regulations and tribal rights
have confronted state legislatures and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Federal election data show that Indian gaming interests gave $2.9
million in hard and soft money during the 2000 campaign, up from about
$128,000 in the 1992 cycle. Five of the top 10 tribal donors from the
last cycle were from California. They gave more than $600,000, mostly in
soft money.</TE>
<TE>   It is unclear how tribes would react to a new federal finance system.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical that tribes maintain their ability to participate in
America's political process," said Mark A. Macarro, tribal chairman of
the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians in Temecula, which gave $132,000 to
federal candidates and party groups--all Democratic--during the 2000
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of the funds the Mashantucket Pequots gave in 1999 and
2000 were soft money donations to parties, predominantly to Democratic
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The tribe also gave to lawmakers across the country, including $1,000
each to Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), J. D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.),
Jim Ramstad (R-Minn.) and Dave Camp (R-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   "We support legislators that support tribal interests," said Daniel
Little, legislative manager in Washington for the tribe. "We are
bipartisan. We give to both parties, including incumbents and
challengers."</TE>
<TE>   Little, defending the donation exception for Indians, noted that
tribes give far less than corporations or unions have given. He said the
Mashantucket Pequots would probably give less if soft money is banned
from federal elections.</TE>
<TE>   The $95,000 limit on hard money donations would rise with inflation.
Campaign finance data indicate it is a generous standard.</TE>
<TE>   If soft money had been banned and if a $95,000 limit had been in
effect during the 2000 cycle, most individual donors would have been
unaffected.</TE>
<TE>   Data from the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, which
tracks political fund-raising, show that only 755 individuals gave more
than $95,000 in hard and soft money during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>Effect of Exception Called 'Minimal'</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), a House sponsor of the campaign
finance legislation, predicted the exception to the proposed $95,000
limit for Indian tribes and other groups would have "minimal" effect. He
said he doubts tribes would seek to give to a huge number of federal
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, critics fear that tribes flush with gaming income would
continue to pour vast sums into the political system.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Rob Simmons (R-Conn.), who backs the reform bill, last July
proposed an amendment to cap tribal donations.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill's chief advocates, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.),
himself a leading congressional recipient of Indian gaming money, were
skeptical. Some feared it would split the pro-reform coalition; others
argued that tribal sovereignty issues could hinder efforts to craft new
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "It is disappointing that at a time when we are trying to enact
meaningful campaign finance reform we refuse to close an obvious loophole
that could be easily sealed," Simmons said at the time.</TE>

<HD>Rocky's Road to Progress</HD>
<DH>Salt Lake City's mayor seems to embody all things Utah is perceived
not to be. As one friend puts it, 'He's not in step with his own
culture.'</DH>

<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>He's a confessed rabble-rouser, the incarnation of everything you
think Utah isn't. Truth be told, there are those who still can't reckon
how Rocky Anderson got himself elected mayor.</LD>
<LD>   He's a lapsed Mormon, twice divorced. Former president of the American
Civil Liberties Union board, anti-death penalty activist, Democrat.
Marshal of the gay pride parade. A fan of the Dalai Lama, the Kennedy
brothers and artist Peter Max.</LD>
<LD>   Nothing in town screams so inarguably of an evolved, edgier Salt Lake
City as its mayor. A self-described "boyish 50," Anderson shares a house
on the edge of the University of Utah campus with his son, a college
freshman. He drinks beer. He plays electric guitar. He dates. He doesn't
exactly speak his mind--he lays it down as edict. He sees himself as a
necessary, modernizing force in this old-fashioned wash of Rocky
Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   And he makes some people awfully uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not in step with his own culture," said Christopher Smart, a
longtime friend and editor of City Weekly newspaper. "And he wants his
own way--all the time."</TE>
<TE>   On the wall of Anderson's office hangs a quote from Dante: "The
hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral
crises maintain their neutrality." Then there's the framed cartoon from
the local paper, in which an ink-line mayor leans against the ropes of a
boxing ring, massive southpaw held aloft. "He's got a mean left," the
caption reads.</TE>
<TE>   In the two years since the onetime plaintiffs' lawyer was elected
mayor, he's turned his attention to loosening the city's famously
stringent liquor laws. He banned discrimination based on sexual
orientation and struck up a therapy program for prostitutes and johns. In
a town geographically and spiritually arranged around the looming Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple, he's clashed with the church
on questions of free speech and booze.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a Robin Hood kind of guy, you know?" said Brent Laws, an
environmentalist who's known Anderson since high school.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty who don't agree. Anderson has been criticized by city
and state leaders for lack of decorum, for plowing ahead single-mindedly,
for his tireless ambition to change, update, replace.</TE>
<TE>   As Anderson would be the first to point out, Utah is more complex than
one might expect: The landscape is laced with ancient Native American and
more recent Latino threads, salted by years as a rough-and-tumble mining
outpost. Still, it's the Mormon culture that etched the deepest mark in
this stunning stretch of mountain and snow. This is a place where public
officials can still light a scandal by uttering a mild curse word, a
state notoriously fond of its guns. And despite the Olympic floodlights,
plenty of people would prefer to remain unknown, unseen and
old-fashioned.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people in the community," said Utah ACLU Executive Director
Carol Gnade, "who aren't interested in anything progressive."</TE>
<TE>Showdown Over Highway Project</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake City is something of an island, Anderson insisted. Just
about half of the city's residents consider themselves Mormon--a notable
drop from the statewide figure of 70%. And unlike the rest of the state,
the politics here lists to the Democratic side.</TE>
<TE>   In the turreted, Romanesque rise of gilt and marble that serves as
City Hall, Anderson wears his disdain for the Utah Legislature on his
sleeve. The lawmakers are "right-wing, reactionary, mean-spirited," the
mayor said. Last week, between Olympic galas and glad-handing and
snowboard races, he managed to churn up a very bitter, very public
argument with the state.</TE>
<TE>   It all started last year, when Utah tried to build a 120-mile highway
in the northern portion of the state, from Nephi to Brigham City.
Anderson chafed. The freeway represented a lot of things he doesn't like:
smog, sprawl, concrete near rare wetlands. He sued the state, and an
appeals court ordered the construction frozen. Last week, the Legislature
threatened to seize the city's Olympic sales tax revenues in payback for
the costly delays.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor was enraged--but he didn't flinch. As newcomers flood the
ragged Wasatch Range, Anderson said, Utah and the rest of the West must
look for unconventional ways to grow. "Another road is not the answer."</TE>
<TE>   It's the mayor's rare intractability that charms his friends--and
irritates his enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to know who you are and who you're not," said Nancy
Saxton, a city councilwoman whom Anderson names as his toughest opponent.
"As the mayor, you're not the president and you're not going to solve the
problems of the world."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't stop Anderson from trying. He putters around town in a
Honda fueled by natural gas. He began a clean-air program to bring Salt
Lake City into compliance with the Kyoto, Japan, global warming
accord--and complains vociferously over the White House's failure to join
the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   The youngest child in a Mormon family in Ogden, Anderson slept through
church services for years. By his late teens, his "fade out" was
complete. "I don't consider it a falling out. I consider it an
evolution."</TE>
<TE>   As a philosophy major at the University of Utah, Anderson was dazzled
by the great political thinkers, by David Hume--"for the richness of
writing and intellectual aspects," the mayor said last week. "The man was
a genius. Did you know he was 23 when he wrote his 'Treatise of Human
Nature'?" Anderson sipped at his coffee, screwed up his face and
interrupted himself.</TE>
<TE>   "This coffee is really, really bad," he said, loud enough for his aide
to hear from the next room. "I mean," he said, leaping to his feet,
striding from the office, "it's really bad."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the tireless mayor makes for a difficult boss. Anderson
has had four communications directors and three chiefs of staff. At least
15 employees have been fired or quit. These days, the turnover rate is
something of a joke.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody's quit in the last few weeks," the ACLU's Gnade
said, squinting across a table at Smart. It was lunchtime, and the two
bent over bowls of soup in a Salt Lake City cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd need a scorecard," the newsman replied with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson is unapologetic. "I've gotten a lot of heat for terminating
people, but I think the public deserves the very best. I'm easy to work
for when people are really committed."</TE>
<TE>A Good Degree of Drifting</TE>
<TE>   It took Anderson some years of drifting to find the work he loved.
After college, he began graduate studies in philosophy, then dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson built fences in Idaho, drove a lumber truck and worked in a
methadone clinic before crossing the Atlantic to wander Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The return from those "magical" months to a post-Nixon America was a
hard letdown: The United States seemed lackluster and undignified.
Anderson waited tables, then hitchhiked to San Francisco, where he was
inspired by an Amnesty International speech about the fall of Salvador
Allende in Chile. Bent on taking up international law, he headed off to
George Washington University law school.</TE>
<TE>   Degree in hand, Anderson came home, found a house in the mountains and
began two decades of trial law. He argued malpractice for plaintiffs,
moved from firm to firm and took on pro bono prison rights cases.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, he made an unsuccessful run for Congress. Three years later,
he ran for mayor. With 11 candidates vying in the open primary, the
Mormon vote was split between two hopefuls, University of Utah political
scientist Dan Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson managed to piece together enough of the non-Mormon vote to
get into a runoff with another Democrat. He defeated Stewart Reid, the
city administrator, 60% to 40%, and moved into the mayor's office.</TE>
<TE>   "People feel like they're getting their money's worth with him," Jones
said. "People outside of Salt Lake City have a difficult time with him
because he's willing to take on issues that are unpopular."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think many of the mainstream Democrats expected to ever see
this in their lifetime," Councilwoman Saxton said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, when a trio of city officials from the Swiss capital, Bern,
filed into City Hall to hear about Olympic pitfalls, Anderson was their
unorthodox host. He spoke briefly about security, demonstrators and
budgets. Then, with a slight wince, he slid a key to the city across the
table.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can find the lock, you let me know," the mayor said
sheepishly. "But, uh, it's a nice symbol, anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Formalities dispensed, Anderson led the men into a back room to view
his prized possession: a splashy, four-frame portrait of John F. Kennedy
by Max.</TE>
<TE>   "I visited his studio," the mayor told another visitor. "He'll have,
like, Led Zeppelin on and just be cranking."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, in a somber corridor lined with onyx panels and oil portraits
of mayors past, Anderson's staff snapped open crates of scotch, vermouth
and vodka. The mayor was throwing another party.</TE>
<TE>   Before they marched back out into the frigid Rocky Mountain dusk, one
of the men from Switzerland turned to the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   "We know you are trying to change things here," he said. Anderson
grinned behind his Armani eyeglasses. Later, he'd repeat the remark to
his staff. "Did you hear that?"</TE>
<TE>   It's exactly how he'd like to be known.</TE>

<HD>Northrop Makes Bid for TRW</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. offered $5.9 billion Friday to acquire TRW
Inc., in a deal that would complete its transformation from a bit player
in the defense industry to one of the most powerful arms contractors in
the world.</LD>
<LD>   The audacious bid surprised Wall Street and fueled speculation about a
bidding war for TRW, among the last unclaimed prizes in an industry that
has gone through a decade of consolidation. Potential rival bidders
include Lockheed Martin Co. and General Dynamics Co., analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of TRW, fabled for powerful lasers, advanced battlefield
software and spy satellites, shot up 26% after Century City-based
Northrop disclosed its unsolicited proposal early Friday morning. TRW did
not respond to Northrop's offer, issuing a statement saying it would
review the matter.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very excited about doing this," Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa
said in an interview Friday. "It adds tremendous capability to our
aerospace business and rounds out the company."</TE>
<TE>   Under terms of its offer, Northrop would exchange $47 in stock for
each TRW share, an 18% premium over the company's closing share price of
$39.80 on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed stock deal, if completed, would propel Northrop past
Boeing Co. to become the nation's second-largest defense contractor,
trailing only Lockheed Martin, and give the company interests in
virtually every facet of the nation's military, from battlefield
command-and-control systems to space-based lasers.</TE>
<TE>   It would create a company with more than 194,000 employees in almost
every state and 25 countries--20,000 of them based in Southern
California. Through a series of bold deals over the last few years,
Northrop has become an industry powerhouse. It completed its $2.1-billion
deal for Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. just three months ago, making it
the world's largest military shipbuilder. Until the early 1980s, Northrop
was primarily a builder of low-cost export jet fighters.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's flurry of mergers in the last decade has produced two
behemoths, Lockheed and Boeing, and a handful of second-tier defense
contractors. With the TRW acquisition, Northrop would be able to join the
elite group, which analysts said the Pentagon may support because it
would create more competition.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, in particular, wants TRW's Redondo Beach-based aerospace and
electronics division, which develops and makes military satellites, laser
weapons and battlefield computer systems. It generates about $7 billion
in revenue.</TE>
<TE>   TRW's satellite manufacturing operation is among the most secret in
the world, but the company is generally thought to be the major producer
of spy satellites that listen into data and telephone communications
around the world. It has also built major research satellites, including
NASA's Chandra X-ray observatory.</TE>
<TE>   "The real value of TRW is not its metal-bending businesses, but its
software integration expertise in creating systems for the entire battle
space," said James McAleese, president of McAleese &amp; Associates, a law
firm that specializes in defense mergers and acquisition. "It would be a
nice complement to Northrop."</TE>
<TE>   As such, Northrop executives said the company would immediately spin
off or sell the automotive parts business, which accounts for about 60%
of revenue but which has been a drag on earnings and has saddled TRW with
$5.5 billion in debt. The company's huge auto-related debt has kept
potential buyers at bay, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But pressure is building for TRW to be broken up.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to be separated," said Simon Ramo, who founded the company
with Dean Wooldridge in the 1950s. "Keeping them together handicaps the
company. The TRW board has to either merge or do it on their own." TRW's
former chief executive, David Cote, abruptly resigned three days ago
after pushing such an agenda.</TE>
<TE>   Kresa asserted Friday that the business was "very attractive for other
people in the auto business," adding that he has already talked to
potential buyers. He declined to provide details. A Northrop spokesman
said the company would assume TRW's debt and then jettison the
auto-related portion of the debt when it is spun off or sold.</TE>
<TE>   The bid came after three days of turmoil for TRW. Cote left to take
the top post at TRW's rival Honeywell International. With the sudden
leadership void, investors began to unload their TRW stock, sending the
value of the shares down by more than 15% in two days. But as quickly as
it dived, it swiftly began to rise again with Northrop's announced bid.</TE>
<TE>   Rumors swelled on Wall Street that Lockheed and General Dynamics, a
defense contractor known for its M-1A1 main battle tank, were considering
a bid of their own. Both companies declined to comment, but investment
bankers said Lockheed executives were quietly trying to quell the
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources said two companies held emergency board meetings to
discuss potential TRW bids.</TE>
<TE>   In responding to Northrop's proposal, TRW executives said they would
review it but criticized the timing of the offer.</TE>
<TE>   "TRW finds it regrettable that Northrop Grumman has chosen to make
this proposal immediately following the unexpected departure of former
chief executive, David Cote, and the aberationally low stock price that
resulted," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kresa tried to downplay the criticism, saying that Northrop had
been considering acquiring TRW for years and that the timing seemed right
to finally make a formal proposal. Kresa said he spoke with Philip Odeen,
a former TRW executive who was brought out of retirement to lead TRW
while it searches for a new chairman.</TE>
<TE>   "Phil agreed to take up with the board," Kresa said. "I hope to get an
answer back next week."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Cleveland-based TRW, which had tumbled earlier in the week,
shot up $10.50 to close at $50.30 in trading Friday, while Northrop
shares dropped $7.85 to close at $109.95. Some analysts hailed the timing
of the bid, which came as TRW shares plunged by more than 15% shortly
after Cote's resignation was disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's vintage Northrop," said Jon B. Kutler, president of Quarterdeck
Investment Partners Inc., a defense industry investment bank. "They've
been talking about a deal with TRW for years and this seemed to be the
window to strike."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, many analysts discounted Northrop making any kind of bid since
it's been enveloped in integrating several major acquisitions including
the recent purchase of Newport News.</TE>
<TE>   The shipyard acquisition was itself surprising because it came shortly
after Northrop had acquired Litton Industries for $3.8 billion. Again
analysts thought Northrop would be too engrossed in the integration to
have the will to make another acquisition.</TE>
<TE>   It has not been surprising to Kresa, who has led more than a dozen
acquisitions in the last decade, cobbling together a defense electronics
powerhouse. But acquiring TRW, his biggest deal yet, would represent
Kresa's crowning achievement.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has about 100,000 employees in 44 states and 25 countries.
TRW has about 94,000 workers. A Northrop official said he didn't
immediately know how many of those employees are involved in the business
units Northrop wants to keep, but said no significant job cuts are
expected to affect those workers.</TE>
<TE>   Kutler said Northrop's acquisition of TRW "would benefit Southern
California, because there would be little redundancy in operations.
Northrop has no local space business and because Northrop is the last
major defense contractor left in the region, the acquisition would
strengthen and reinforce it."</TE>
<TE>   A number of employees at TRW's Redondo Beach facility were reluctant
to comment on the proposed takeover. But Quin Kan, a senior TRW technical
staffer who manages databases, said that based on the market reaction
Friday to the announcement, a takeover of his company might be a good
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I don't think it would make a difference," he said. "I
don't foresee things changing here in the near future."</TE>

<HD>TV Networks Find Ways to Stretch Educational Rules</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The federal code for three hours of kids' programs
is not a moneymaker.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEG JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Parents, heads up: NBC is offering your children an educational
opportunity this morning. It's called "NBA: Inside Stuff," and it teaches
"peaceful conflict resolutions and global awareness."</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe they've already caught the Saturday morning music videos that
a San Francisco station says give children an appreciation for the
"multicultural aspect of music and the world around them."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there's also the syndicated show "Kids 'N Motorsports,"
where youngsters can pick up information about "technical advances,
engines, clutches . . . and basic nuts-and-bolts facts."</LD>
<TE>   This isn't exactly what Congress had in mind 12 years ago when it
passed the Children's Television Act, requiring all local TV stations to
provide educational programming for children 16 and younger.</TE>
<TE>   But these examples, culled from federal regulatory records, reflect
the new economic realities of children's television.</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters and their advertisers see educational programming as the
TV equivalent of leafy green vegetables. They're being force fed a
restriction that drains profits. Young viewers are leaving in droves,
finding better fare, whenever they want, on their cable menus.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, the only thing keeping the major networks in children's
programming is the federal requirement that their stations air three
hours a week of educational programming.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that's hardly a burden; yet broadcasters are still fudging
the rules. In recent weeks, the debate over the finances and obligations
of TV stations has intensified. The reason: Fox recently sold four hours
of its Saturday morning TV time for $25 million a year to a company that
will air animated programs designed to sell toys. Left undecided is how
and when the network plans on fulfilling the federal rule.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also auctioned its Saturday morning time because children's
programming had become too unprofitable. NBC's slots went to Discovery
Networks, which will supply the educational shows. The sale illustrates
the dynamics of the marketplace. NBC got $8 million, a fraction of the
amount Fox made by attaching few educational strings to its buyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Most parents would say that three hours a week is a pretty paltry
price for broadcasters to pay for a free license and the right to make
millions of dollars from programs throughout the week," said Rep. Edward
J. Markey (D-Mass.), who sponsored the Children's Television Act. "Is
three hours too big a price for them to serve the public interest and our
children?"</TE>
<TE>   A University of Pennsylvania study in 1999 by the Annenberg Public
Policy Center found that a fifth of all programs billed as educational
for children had "little or no educational value" and failed to meet
Federal Communications Commission standards.</TE>
<TE>   And that's bad news, according to another study. Georgetown University
found that children exposed to educational television shows had higher
academic achievement than children who did not watch such shows.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the FCC, which regulates and licenses broadcasters, say
enforcement of the rule is tricky because there is no single definition
of what constitutes an educational show.</TE>
<TE>   The rule simply requires that broadcast stations air "any television
programming that furthers the educational and informational needs of
children . . . in any respect, including the child's
intellectual/cognitive or social/emotional needs."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the rule's inherent subjectivity, the agency does not
police the content of the shows the stations say satisfy the rule, said
Barbara Kreisman, chief of the FCC's video services division, which
oversees enforcement of the rule.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like to get involved with issues of quality," she said. "We
defer to the judgment of broadcasters, and we rely upon parents to
monitor."</TE>
<TE>Cable Exempt From FCC Rules</TE>
<TE>   No station has ever been challenged for not complying with the rules.
Nor has any station's license been denied during the renewal of its
license. The law does not apply to cable channels because they do not use
public airwaves to transmit their signals.</TE>
<TE>   One key reason the rule remains on the books is that an estimated 20%
of the 100 million U.S. households with TVs do not subscribe to cable or
satellite service.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of poor kids who don't have cable," said Sandra
Calvert, a Georgetown University psychology professor who has studied the
effect of children's television. "[Network] broadcasters have a greater
responsibility to the public."</TE>
<TE>   The debate over children's television has been a seesaw saga that
dates back to the early days of television.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1940s--when TV was a novelty, not a multibillion-dollar
business--many children's shows aired without commercials.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1960s, networks realized there was money to be made by
clumping together low-cost animated cartoons on Saturday mornings. Soon
they were loaded with commercials for toys, Coco Puffs and Flintstone's
Chewable Vitamins.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, federal codes allowed no more than 9 1/2 minutes per hour
of commercial advertisements during prime time. But there were no
restrictions on Saturday mornings.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, a group of Boston moms banded together as the watchdog Action
for Children's Television to push for reforms and fewer commercials. They
lobbied, filed petitions and brought lawsuits, forcing the television
industry to come up with a series of standards or face tougher regulation
by the government.</TE>
<TE>   This breathed life into the production of a raft of such weekday
educational shows as PBS' "Sesame Street" and ABC's "After School
Special."</TE>
<TE>   More rules were on the way, until the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan,
who favored less Washington regulation. His administration said the
marketplace would respond to children's needs.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't happen, according to a UC Santa Barbara study at the
time, which found that commercial broadcasters did not provide a single
educational show during a sample week in the Greater Los Angeles area.
Another regulatory movement was born, but not without a fight.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks argued all throughout the '80s that children's
programming wasn't their job or that it was too expensive," Markey said.
"They argued that they couldn't make as much money when they made
programs that were educational."</TE>
<TE>   Although Congress passed the Children's Television Act in 1990,
controversy erupted again when stations soon began saying that the
"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" illustrated how good can triumph over
evil. An Ohio station, meanwhile, said a "Phil Donahue" episode was
educational. It was about teenage strippers.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the FCC in 1996 was pushed to tighten the standards and
adopted the three-hour rule.</TE>
<TE>   "The networks have never really been interested in serving the
interests of children," said Peggy Charren, the Boston grandmother who
began the national crusade for better children's programming 34 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for broadcasters, industry experts say, is that with the
rise of cable, children are no longer the captive Saturday morning
audience they were even a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a pretty healthy business for everyone to be in," said Lee
Gaither, NBC's vice president for family entertainment. "You had a pie
with four pieces, but now that pie is split into eight pieces."</TE>
<TE>   When the Children's Television Act became law, more than half of all
kids watching Saturday morning TV were tuned into the four major
networks--ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. By last year, the number had dropped to
26%, according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday morning ritual of cartoons and Lucky Charms has been
shelved by an inexhaustible supply of children's shows on cable every
day, around the clock. Why wait for Saturday when there's Nick all the
time?</TE>
<TE>   The way CBS and ABC are weathering the changes is to turn to their
parent companies, which have vast production and distribution operations
for children's shows.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom Inc., which owns CBS, also owns Nickelodeon. Walt Disney Co.,
meanwhile, owns ABC and the Disney Channel. Both conglomerates use their
popular educational shows to fill their Saturday morning network lineups.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and NBC do not have similar corporate girdings to prop them up.
They've turned elsewhere for their fall lineups.</TE>
<TE>Fox's Hold on Kids' Shows Drops</TE>
<TE>   Fox, once the leader in children's programming, now has the lowest
Saturday morning ratings.</TE>
<TE>   When the network launched its children's programming in 1990, it saw
an opening to provide shows during the week, not just on Saturday, as the
other networks were doing.</TE>
<TE>   But then came the onslaught of alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "By about 1995, I was starting to look over my shoulder and worry
about cable," said Margaret Loesch, founding president of Fox Kids
Networks who later started the Hallmark Channel. "The landscape was
already starting to change."</TE>
<TE>   Fox, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., began buying stations whose
revenue was driven by local news shows, forcing the network to drop
children's programs from their late-afternoon slots.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids' programming had been a wonderful business for Fox for a while,"
Loesch said. "But they found that children and news were incompatible."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Vinciquerra, president of the Fox Television Network, said the
network can no longer afford to compete against the 24-hour children's
channels on cable.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids' television business has changed dramatically," Vinciquerra
said. "It's a multimedia approach to get these kids interested in these
programs.</TE>
<TE>Fox, NBC Auction Programming Block</TE>
<TE>   And who better to understand the whims of children than 4Kids
Entertainment, a New York toy-licensing company that made more than $100
million from Pokemon? In a dramatic move, Fox leased its Saturday morning
block in January to 4Kids for $25.3 million a year for up to six years.</TE>
<TE>   In return, 4Kids snagged a four-hour national platform to promote its
new toys and video games. And if 4Kids can produce a program that
launches another Pokemon, $25 million will seem like chump change.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the opportunities that we have and the amount we would have
had to pay for a network," said Joe Garrity, 4Kids' chief operating
officer. "We have exactly the piece we want: Saturday mornings, prime
time for kids."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "We're in the entertainment business, not education."</TE>
<TE>   So far Fox is requiring 4Kids to provide only 30 minutes of the three
hours of the FCC's educational requirement. Network executives say they
aren't sure yet when the rest of the shows will air or what those shows
might be.</TE>
<TE>   "The equation is turning back to the early '80s, when broadcasters
were more interested in making money rather than providing quality
programming," said Herb Scannell, president of Nickelodeon.</TE>
<TE>   NBC, owned by General Electric Co., teamed up with Discovery Networks
because it was concerned about the educational rule and about preserving
its image, according to NBC executive Gaither.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fox-4Kids deal is basically the reason why the three-hour rule
exists," Gaither said. "You've got a network saying we're going to put
four hours of toy commercials on the air and that's OK."</TE>

<HD>Mexicans Say Drug Lord May Be Dead</HD>
<DH>Crime: Authorities suspect that Ramon Arellano Felix of the Tijuana
cartel was killed in a shootout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. SMITH</AU>
<AU>KEN ELLINGWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>Authorities were trying to determine Friday whether a man killed in
a shootout with police this month was Ramon Arellano Felix, the reputed
leader of Mexico's most-feared drug cartel.</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper Noroeste in Mexico's Sinaloa state reported that
Arellano Felix was shot dead Feb. 10 in the seaside resort of Mazatlan.
Arellano Felix is on the FBI's 10 most-wanted list alongside Osama bin
Laden, and the State Department has offered a reward of up to $2 million
for his capture.</LD>
<LD>   The newspaper alleged that Arellano Felix had gone to Mazatlan during
its annual carnival to kill one of his drug-trafficking rivals, Ismael
Zambada. While Arellano Felix and his henchman cruised the beach strip
looking for Zambada, the paper said, state police stopped the men's
Volkswagen. A gun battle broke out that left one officer and two suspects
dead, the paper reported.</LD>
<TE>   Mexican and U.S. officials said only that the case is being
investigated. But Sinaloa state officials also acknowledged that the
bodies of the two slain suspects, including the one that could be
Arellano Felix, had been returned a day later to people claiming to be
family members, potentially undermining the probe.</TE>
<TE>   If Arellano Felix was indeed killed, it would be by far the biggest
blow to drug traffickers since President Vicente Fox took office in
December 2000 vowing an all-out war on drugs. But the death of Arellano
Felix, whose family allegedly controls the Tijuana cartel, would also
likely set off reprisals and further bloodshed by the brutal drug gang.</TE>
<TE>   The report came a day after the head of special investigations in the
federal anti-drug unit was gunned down in his car on a Mexico City
avenue. Mexican officials said the man, Mario Roldan Quirino, was
probably slain to halt a major investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The reported Mazatlan shootout was the latest in a spurt of
drug-related violence in Sinaloa state, the home of the Arellano Felix
family. In November, two federal judges were gunned down in Mazatlan in
what was described as the first such killings.</TE>
<TE>   Sinaloa Gov. Juan Millan said after those slayings that Fox's
declaration of war against the Arellano Felix cartel had pressured the
family in Tijuana, the stronghold of its drug trade, and fed violence in
nearby Sinaloa. Millan said then that the number of drug-related murders
in Sinaloa had increased in 2001 to about 560 after falling in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Arellano Felix, 37, placed on the FBI's list in September 1997, was
accused of importing huge quantities of cocaine, marijuana and
amphetamines into the United States. A lengthy indictment against him and
his older brother Benjamin was unsealed in May 2000, accusing them of
numerous trafficking offenses.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon, 6-foot-2 and 220 pounds, has long been known as the most
violent of the reputed four active brothers in the cartel and as the
gang's chief enforcer. He has been accused of orchestrating dozens of
slayings of informants and rivals.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Blancornelas, who survived an assassination attempt attributed
to the Arellano Felix brothers in November 1997, said that if Ramon
indeed had died in the shootout, "I don't believe that the cartel of the
Arellano Felix will be weakened. They have shown us for years that when
they have lost their best people, they have replaced them immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "If it was true, this is a result of the vanity of Ramon Arellano,
wanting to go to Mazatlan to personally kill 'El Mayo' Zambada. If it was
this, it cost him his life," said Blancornelas, the feisty editor of Zeta
magazine in Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Ramon Arellano Felix had died in the shootout, Mexican
Atty. Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha told reporters: "It is a
possibility. . . . We are trying to establish if the person was Ramon
Arellano Felix."</TE>
<TE>   Noroeste newspaper said one of the suspects slain in the shootout was
identified as Efrain Quintero. He had been accused of leading the
massacre of 12 people in a Sinaloa village in February 2001.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Slain During Suicide Bombing Attempt</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Incident in West Bank highlights militants' new focus on
Israeli settlements, and flaws of Sharon's security plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Shoppers crowding the supermarket in Efrat, a Jewish settlement in
the West Bank, heard a pop from the bread section Friday morning and then
noticed a Palestinian suicide bomber trying to blow himself up.</LD>
<LD>   One of the settlers and a guard quickly whipped out their pistols and
shot the man to death, averting what authorities said would have been a
disastrous explosion in a market bustling ahead of the Jewish Sabbath.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time in seven days that a Palestinian had entered a
settlement with the purpose of detonating a bomb to kill himself and as
many Jews as possible, and it underscored a recent shift by Palestinian
militants to focus their attacks on settlers and soldiers inside the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.</LD>
<TE>   Later, an Israeli was shot and killed, presumably by Palestinian
gunmen, as he drove on a road north of Jerusalem used by settlers to
bypass Arab villages, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident, a Jewish settler was badly injured by Israeli
troops after the man stopped his car and opened fire on what he claimed
were Palestinian gunmen. The army said it mistook the settler for a
Palestinian and shot him. Soldiers, realizing their mistake, later
scoured the nearest Palestinian neighborhood and found a fake plastic
gun, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   The Efrat bomb incident also exposed flaws in a plan by Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon to carve out buffer zones throughout the region to
divide Israelis and Palestinians. About 200,000 Israeli Jews live in more
than 140 settlements scattered throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
and Sharon has offered no explanation of how a buffer zone can protect
settlements if they are left intact.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon reiterated the government's intention to establish "security
separation" in a speech Thursday night. Billed as a major address to his
increasingly despondent people, the comments were widely condemned Friday
from the right, left and center as uninspiring, insufficient and vague at
a time when strong leadership is desperately needed.</TE>
<TE>   "The lion that meowed," is how commentator Yoel Marcus put it in a
front-page editorial in the influential Haaretz daily.</TE>
<TE>   A poll published Friday in Israel's largest newspaper, Yediot
Aharonot, said Sharon's credibility among Israelis had plunged from 70%
in December to 54% this month. Until now, Sharon had enjoyed consistently
high approval ratings since his landslide election a year ago. With the
death toll mounting in a 17-month-old conflict that has already claimed
more than 1,100 lives on both sides, confidence in Sharon is clearly
slipping.</TE>
<TE>   Eve Harow, a spokeswoman for Jewish settlers who lives in Efrat, said
she was disappointed that Sharon's speech didn't go far enough. As far as
she is concerned, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat is an
"enemy" who "must be removed from the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Harow said the attempted suicide bombing at the Efrat supermarket
earlier in the day further riled and unnerved the settlers, who are
afraid that Sharon's proposed buffer zones will offer little protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it an inch-wide buffer zone, a mile-wide buffer zone? Is it a
fence, a border, a minefield?" said Harow, who moved to Efrat from Los
Angeles 14 years ago. "Efrat abuts . . . [the Palestinian-ruled town of]
Bethlehem. Where's the buffer zone?"</TE>
<TE>   Although Sharon offered no details, Israeli media reported Friday that
the cordon would run parallel to the line that represents Israel's
pre-1967 border but cut a couple of miles deeper into Palestinian
territory and will be fortified by electric fences, concrete blocks,
sensors, mines, trenches, regular army patrols and other obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians fear that the buffer zones would further slice up their
territory and corral 3 million Palestinians into disconnected ghettos
instead of a viable future state. Many on the Israeli left maintain that
only the dismantling of the settlements--built on land that Israel
captured in 1967 and considered illegal under international law--and
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip will lead to peace with the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   The Yediot Aharonot poll showed majority support for evacuating all
settlements in Gaza (57%) and some or all in the West Bank (59%).</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian fighters regard settlers and settlements as legitimate
targets, along with soldiers, even though many settlers are not armed.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Harow and other settlers are worried about how the attacker
entered Efrat, which, like many settlements, is guarded by the military.
Several residents said they believe that the man, later identified as
Mohammed Ashimari, 22, from the nearby village of Adoha, was one of
dozens of Palestinians who had entry permits as part of a construction
crew. Police said that they found a belt of explosives on his body and
that he may have also left a bomb on a grocery shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Despite international pressure not to expand the settlements, many of
the enclaves are rapidly building new homes, and they employ Palestinians
for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Harow and other settlers said the escalating violence will force them
to reassess whether they should continue to employ Palestinian workers.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has come for all of us to realize that apparently none of
them can be trusted," Hisdai Eliezer, head of a security committee for
settlements, told Israeli radio.</TE>

<HD>Angola Says It Killed Leading Rebel Savimbi</HD>
<DH>Africa: UNITA group does not confirm death of man who spearheaded
nearly 30-year revolt. Government claims he died during army assault.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The Angolan government reported Friday that rebel leader Jonas
Savimbi, who has led a struggle for power in that country for almost 30
years, was killed during fighting with the army.</LD>
<LD>   A statement read on Angolan radio and television said Savimbi, who led
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola--or UNITA, under
a Portuguese acronym--died earlier in the day during an army attack on
the rebel group in Moxico province in southeastern Angola.</LD>
<LD>   There was no independent confirmation of the claim, and UNITA
officials were not available for comment. A spokeswoman for the State
Department in Washington said, "We have heard from multiple sources" that
Savimbi is dead. But U.S. officials could not confirm the reports.</LD>
<TE>   A presidential spokesman in Angola told reporters in the capital,
Luanda, that Savimbi's body would soon be shown to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The reported death of Savimbi, 67, could signal an end to the 27-year
war in the former Portuguese colony, foreign observers said. On Friday,
the government indicated to reporters in Luanda that it was ready to
implement a 1994 peace accord that called for regular democratic
elections. The U.N.-brokered deal had collapsed in 1998, as did two
earlier agreements.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting has claimed the lives of an estimated 500,000 people,
while 4 million others--or roughly one-third of the population--have been
driven from their homes in the southwestern African nation, according to
U.N. statistics. Human rights groups claim that both sides have committed
atrocities.</TE>
<TE>   Born Jonas Malheiro Savimbi to a poor family in the central highlands
village of Munhango, the veteran guerrilla leader was educated in
Protestant missionary schools.</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi, the imposing, jovial son of a railway stationmaster, studied
medicine in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, and political science in
Switzerland. He left Europe in 1961 to fight Portuguese rule and formed
UNITA, gradually managing to amass a force of more than 60,000 troops.</TE>
<TE>   At independence in 1975, Savimbi, a member of the country's majority
ethnic Ovimbundu group, began fighting government troops of the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola, or MPLA, led by his longtime
rival, current President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict would become one of Africa's longest-running wars. Those
who knew him say Savimbi's insatiable lust for power was largely to
blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent a lot of time with Savimbi in the U.S. and in Angola and
always found him on the surface to be a charming, erudite and
intellectually interesting guerrilla leader," said one former U.S.
government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Yet below the
surface, he was nothing short of a maniacal megalomaniac."</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi became a key player in the Cold War struggle for dominance in
Africa, acting as a proxy of the United States and South Africa in the
battle against Angola's Marxist government.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a side of him that was very charming, but he was an
immensely manipulative man," said Judith Matloff, a U.S. journalist who
met Savimbi on several occasions and is the author of "Fragments of a
Forgotten War," an account of the Angolan conflict. "He was a man of
Maoist ideologist background that he never really dropped. But he was
able to fool the West that he was anti-Communist and pro-capitalist."</TE>
<TE>   But with the demise of the Soviet Union, Savimbi was no longer crucial
as a Cold War player. The Angolan government had begun to shed its
Marxist cloak and move close to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   A succession of U.N. peace plans led to elections in September 1992.
UNITA lost. Savimbi denounced the elections as rigged. Critics called him
a spoiler. His resistance to democracy made him increasingly isolated.</TE>
<TE>   "What was terrifying for him was that suddenly the world order had
changed, the Cold War was over, and, God forbid, he lost the elections,"
Matloff said. "It was too much to bear."</TE>
<TE>   Months later, fighting resumed. Another deal, brokered in 1994,
unraveled in 1998. A stockpile of diamonds sold on the black market is
believed to have helped UNITA fund its war, despite a U.N. oil and arms
embargo.</TE>
<TE>   "Savimbi was the most negative influence on Angola over the last few
years," Matloff said. "All of these decades of war were largely due to
him."</TE>
<TE>   The toll in terms of civilian lives, infrastructure and Angola's
economic development has been astronomical.</TE>
<TE>   Kenzo Oshima, the United Nations' emergency relief coordinator, told
the Security Council last week that the deadly combination of famine and
guerrilla warfare has made conditions in Angola "among the worst in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   Savimbi's troops "continue to destabilize large parts of the
countryside" and routinely steal donated food and medical supplies and
harass aid workers in the country, Oshima said.</TE>
<TE>   Life expectancy in Angola is now only 44 years, and declining. One in
three children dies before age 5. And young boys are being press-ganged
into military service by rebel and government forces alike, according to
Oshima.</TE>
<TE>   "The status of children is catastrophic," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the government has chased UNITA out of its main
strongholds. Several senior officers have reportedly been killed. There
have been reports of high-level defections from Savimbi's military ranks.
And U.N. sanctions designed to choke off support for the Angolan rebels
have seriously weakened UNITA.</TE>
<TE>   But still Savimbi refused to compromise, continuing to insist that the
people loved him and that he alone could lead Angola into a free and
democratic age.</TE>

<HD>S. Africa Clarifies AIDS Drug Policy</HD>
<DH>Health: An ad campaign explains plans to reduce the spread of the
disease. Critics call it an attempt to stall on providing antiretroviral
medication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa
</DL>
<LD>The government here launched a full-court press Friday to clarify
its position on the use of anti-AIDS drugs and quiet a storm of
criticism.</LD>
<LD>   At a regular Cabinet meeting earlier in the week, authorities resolved
to step up efforts to eliminate inconsistencies in what activists, health
officials and opposition politicians say has been a controversial and
confusing policy toward South Africa's AIDS epidemic.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign kicked off with a high-profile advertisement in national
newspapers Friday headlined "A Message From The Government." It sought to
explain the state's program aimed at reducing the spread to infants of
the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, and to underscore
official resolve to deal with the crisis.</LD>
<TE>   "The primary aim is to clarify the government's position and ensure
there are no ambiguities," said Joel Netshitenzhe, head of government
communications. He added that, if necessary, additional public
announcements will be used to communicate the government's stance.</TE>
<TE>   But critics said the communication campaign is just another way of
delaying decisive action on allowing the widespread use of anti-AIDS
drugs in a country where about 4.7 million people--more than 10% of the
population--are HIV-positive and an estimated 70,000 babies are born with
the virus every year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just part of the procrastination," said Clive Evian, a doctor
and director of AIDS Management and Support, a public health consulting
group. "They should stop talking and leave the decisions to the
clinicians. They should leave the care to the doctors, nurses and
hospital authorities and what they can do with what's available in their
budgets."</TE>
<TE>   The government's advertisement said that South Africa will expand
research into the use of the anti-AIDS drug nevirapine, which
international studies show can limit mother-to-child transmission of HIV,
but that the treatment will not be universally available.</TE>
<TE>   The government has cited cost, inadequate infrastructure, and the lack
of knowledge about possible negative side effects of nevirapine in
declining to provide the drug at public clinics. It has authorized
experimental trials of the drug at 18 treatment centers around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   "Universal access will be decided upon when important questions have
been answered by the research," Friday's ad read.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-AIDS activists said the state is wasting time making poor excuses
instead of exploring concrete ways to make antiretroviral medication
immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   "They are beating around the bush," Evian said. "For some reason, they
are reluctant to put their full force behind this issue. They are looking
at how they can't do it rather than how they can do it."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the government also reaffirmed its decision to continue
appealing a court order won by activists in December that grants access
to nevirapine at all state hospitals. The ad said, however, that the
appeal is not motivated by government reluctance to expand efforts to
curtail mother-to-child transmission of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   "It is because we need to gain clarity on whether the courts or the
elected government decides on the detail of providing health services.
This is a critical question about the division of powers in our
democracy," the ad said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the fact that the government felt compelled to launch an
advertising campaign had more to do with the substance of its rhetoric
than with an inability to convey its message.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the issue is failure to communicate," said Steven
Friedman, director of the Center for Policy Studies, a Johannesburg think
tank. "I think what the government is communicating is the problem. It's
the kind of messages that are coming out of government that's the
problem."</TE>
<TE>   South African President Thabo Mbeki has drawn criticism for
questioning the link between HIV and AIDS and for downplaying figures
that show AIDS to be the leading cause of death in this country.</TE>
<TE>   The government's approach to dealing with the pandemic has faced
serious challenges in recent weeks from key politicians, medical
specialists and rights activists. In addition, several provincial
administrations have defied national policy by either ordering doctors to
administer nevirapine or announcing their intention to make the treatment
widely available.</TE>

<HD>Pearl Slaying May Be Tied to Year-Old Plot</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: At least seven suspects, all Islamic jihad veterans, are
sought in the reporter's death, investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Investigators in Pakistan said Friday that they are seeking at
least seven suspects in the kidnapping and killing of Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl and hinted at a conspiracy stretching to the Middle
East and dating to more than a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Pearl's captors visited at least one Persian Gulf country in what
intelligence sources believe to be an "extra-regional" conspiracy that
targeted Pearl through contacts he made with them as many as 18 months
ago, according to Pakistani intelligence sources.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects are hardened Islamic jihad veterans who fought in
Afghanistan, the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir and the separatist
Russian republic of Chechnya, according to one source.</LD>
<TE>   "You're looking at a backlog of jihadis--people who are highly
motivated," the source said. "They are not desperadoes."</TE>
<TE>   That interpretation of the kidnapping, based on investigations into
the videotape of Pearl's execution that was delivered to the U.S.
Consulate in the port city of Karachi, where the journalist disappeared
Jan. 23, greatly differs from earlier theories put out by Pakistani
police that Pearl may have stumbled inadvertently, and recently, onto a
criminal gang.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the suspects nor Pearl's body was found Friday, as
investigators questioned the man who delivered the videotape to the
consulate, according to police sources.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, U.S. officials said Friday that Pearl's killers forced
him to read a prepared statement denouncing American support for Israel
and the U.S. presence in Afghanistan before they slashed his throat and
decapitated him on camera, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl also can be heard on the brief video saying that he and his
father, an Israeli who lives in Encino, are Jewish. Moments later,
according to officials familiar with the tape, an unseen assailant
suddenly grabbed Pearl by the neck and brutally attacked him with a
knife.</TE>
<TE>   One U.S. official said Pearl's statement was several sentences long
and "criticizes U.S. policy in support of Israel, and then speaks out
against the U.S. presence in Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   The official said the message did not appear to be from Osama bin
Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network, but he declined to be more specific.
"That would be giving the bad guys precisely what they want, which is to
get their propaganda out there," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said that the vicious nature of the killing, combined
with a scripted political diatribe, suggested that Pearl's abductors were
seasoned terrorists who probably never planned to release him.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani Foreign Ministry called Pearl's killing "an outrage
against the cherished values of our society," and President Pervez
Musharraf pledged to continue his government's crackdown on extremist
groups that have flourished here.</TE>
<TE>   "For those who commit terrorist acts, it is Pakistan's resolve, as
well as my own personal resolve, that terrorism will be eradicated from
Pakistan," Musharraf told state-owned Pakistan Television on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and local government officials visited Pearl's widow, Mariane,
who is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child. "She was very
confident, and she praised the work of law enforcement," said Brig.
Mukhtar Ahmed, the home secretary of Sindh province, where Karachi is
located.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released by the Journal, Mariane Pearl said: "The
terrorists who say they killed my husband may have taken his life, but
they did not take his spirit. Danny is my life. They may have taken my
life, but they did not take my spirit."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators have abandoned the caution they exercised when they
feared for Pearl's safety, said Jameel Yusuf, a Karachi businessman who
heads a police-citizens liaison committee on kidnappings and is close to
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be expedited because the loss of life has already occurred,
so there's not as much need for caution," said Yusuf, who has worked on
numerous kidnapping cases in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   The frantic activity since Pearl's disappearance, Yusuf said, was
unusual for Pakistani police. "We are doing things we have never done for
our own people," he said. In fact, many officers were kept at work during
the Eid al-Adha holiday marking the end of the hajj, or pilgrimage to the
Saudi city of Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   Yusuf, one of the last people to have seen Pearl alive, had been
convinced to the end that the Journal's South Asia bureau chief remained
alive, and learning of his death on the eve of a festive Muslim holiday
came as a personal blow.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't see the purpose of killing Daniel," he said. "It hasn't
gained them anything. On the contrary, they have lost everything."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that it was odd that Pearl's body had not been found, even
though police sources believe that Pearl was killed some time ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, the British-born Islamic militant who
confessed to masterminding the kidnapping during a court hearing last
week, has said he was told by captors that Pearl was killed around Jan.
31.</TE>
<TE>   Among the seven suspects being sought are two identified by police as
Amjad Hussain Farooqi and Mohammed Hashim Qadeer, who are believed to be
connected to the violently radical group Jaish-e-Mohammed, which is
fighting to wrest parts of Kashmir from Indian control.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities believe that the two men used telephone conversations and
false e-mail identities to set up a fake meeting at a local restaurant in
downtown Karachi from which Pearl vanished. Pearl, 38, was investigating
e-mails between accused "shoe bomber" Richard C. Reid and a militant
group, Jamaat ul-Fuqra, and believed that he would interview the group's
leader, Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani.</TE>
<TE>   Four days later, a hitherto unknown group that dubbed itself the
National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty sent out
the first of two e-mails with photographs of Pearl in captivity. Among
other ultimatums, the abductors demanded the release of all Pakistani
prisoners taken by U.S. forces in the fighting in Afghanistan, and of the
former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The group followed up Jan. 30 with photos of Pearl with a gun to his
head, and a threat to execute him within 24 hours, a deadline it now
appears the group obeyed.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Friday's new leads, mystery still cloaked Sheikh's role in
the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   Hamid Mir, editor of the Urdu-language Ausaf newspaper in the capital,
Islamabad, said he interviewed Sheikh and was left with the impression
that the suspect was mentally unstable. Mir, who has been kidnapped
himself, is the last reporter known to have interviewed Bin Laden, and
has monitored terrorist groups for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought his mental state was unstable," Mir said. "He would be very
pro-jihad, then anti-Pakistan, then anti-American, and then he would talk
about founding a progressive school, where kids could learn computers. I
thought he was a very gone case and very dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   Mir said he suspects that Sheikh had the backing of sinister forces,
perhaps ousted and disgruntled members of Pakistan's notorious
Inter-Services Intelligence agency, which supported the Taliban, domestic
jihad groups and the anti-Soviet moujahedeen before them.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has fired the head of ISI and reshuffled mid-level
brigadiers in an attempt to break the agency's ties with radical groups,
and the kidnapping is seen as a response aimed at embarrassing the
president.</TE>

<LD>Sri Lanka's government and separatist rebels signed a cease-fire
deal, renewing hopes for peace in a country where more than 64,000 people
have been killed in 18 years of terrorism and government retaliation.</LD>
<LD>   The island off India's southern tip has been ripped apart by one of
the world's most intense terrorist campaigns. The rebels have been
fighting since 1983 for a separate country in the north and east for
minority Tamils, who are mostly Hindu.</LD>
<LD>   There were no face-to-face talks leading up to the deal, which was
arranged through Norwegian mediators. The signing, likewise, was done
separately.</LD>

<HD>Reporter's Death Highlights Increased Risks of Covering War</HD>
<DH>Media: The front lines--and enemy--in modern conflicts aren't
always clear, one expert says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The slaying of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter
kidnapped in Pakistan last month, is grim evidence of the growing danger
to journalists covering modern warfare and civil unrest abroad.</LD>
<LD>   "Conflicts have changed, and the way journalists cover them has
changed," says Ann Cooper, executive director of the Committee to Protect
Journalists. "You go back to World War II and even Vietnam, and
journalists were usually traveling with the U.S. military. That put them
in great danger when there was a battle, but they weren't crossing the
front lines and interviewing the [Nazis] and the Viet Cong.</LD>
<LD>   "Nowadays, in wars and in covering civil conflicts, journalists are
trying to get both sides of the story, and they may travel on both sides
of the front lines, and sometimes the U.S. military isn't even there."</LD>
<TE>   Moreover, Cooper and others say, today's front lines are often less
clear, and today's enemy often less easily identifiable, than in past
wars.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's killers appear to have been part of a still not fully
identified Pakistani splinter group that lured him into a trap and
kidnapped him in the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Pearl had gone to
Karachi to investigate possible links between a Pakistani Islamic
militant leader, Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, and Richard C. Reid, a
British national accused of trying to blow up a transatlantic airliner in
December by detonating explosives hidden in his shoes.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to Western news organizations shortly after the
kidnapping, Pearl's abductors called themselves the National Movement for
the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, a group then unknown to
American officials. It's the existence of precisely that kind of shadowy,
fragmented enemy force that has increased the risk for journalists.
Indeed, there are often several such forces in one country or even in a
particular area of one country--opposing factions that are fighting the
government or each other.</TE>
<TE>   Modern technology has exacerbated the risks of combat coverage.
Journalists now have satellite phones and videophones and laptop
computers and small cameras, and they can get closer to the action than
ever before. They can also file stories directly from remote locations,
without having to return to the relative safety of a city to find a
telephone or a telegraph office.</TE>
<TE>   "The imperative of the job means if you can do it, you're going to do
it--get into the area where the combat is," says Steven Livingston, a
political scientist in the school of media and public affairs at George
Washington University in Washington. "Competition encourages risk-taking,
and modern technology facilitates risk-taking."</TE>
<TE>   Modern technology also makes it possible for more news
organizations--even those without vast resources--to send reporters,
photographers, producers and camera crews to a war zone. As Cooper says,
"The more journalists you have there, the more journalists you have at
risk."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time--and unlike in earlier wars in which they were
largely accidental victims--journalists are increasingly targeted
specifically because they're journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes they're targeted because the enemy thinks that they're
high-visibility, negotiable commodities, as appears to have been the case
with Pearl. Sometimes it's in reprisal for what they've written or for
what their government has done. Sometimes it's simply because journalists
in foreign countries are known to carry significant amounts of cash and
to have expensive equipment that can be sold or bartered.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl was the ninth Western journalist killed since the war in
Afghanistan began. The others were Ulf Stromberg of TV4 in Sweden,
Johanne Sutton of Radio France Internationale, Pierre Billaud of Radio
Television Luxembourg, freelance reporter Volker Handloik, Julio Fuentes
of El Mundo in Spain, Maria Grazia Cutuli of the Corriere della Sera
newspaper in Italy, and Azizullah Haidari and Harry Burton, both of
Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen others have been robbed, arrested, kidnapped or shot
at, and before the collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, reports
were widespread that Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders had offered a bounty of
$50,000 to $100,000 to anyone who killed a foreign journalist.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's killing was similar to that of George Polk, the CBS
correspondent who disappeared May 8, 1948, during the Greek civil war
while working on a story about a Greek government minister--and while
trying to arrange an interview with a communist guerrilla leader. Polk's
body was found a week later in Salonica Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The George Polk Awards, given annually in his honor, were created the
next year by Long Island University.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's slaying, which was apparently videotaped by his killers, also
has grisly similarities to the notorious killing of another American
journalist, ABC television reporter Bill Stewart. In 1979, a Nicaraguan
National Guardsman put a bullet in Stewart's head at point-blank range as
Stewart knelt in front of him, with ABC cameras rolling all the while.</TE>
<TE>   The video was later shown on the major U.S. television networks.</TE>
<TE>   The targeting of journalists accelerated somewhat in the 1980s and
considerably in the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Three journalists were kidnapped during the Lebanese civil war, and
one--Terry Anderson of Associated Press--was held hostage from 1985 to
1991. None was killed.</TE>
<TE>   But in several more recent wars, journalists have been targeted for
death, and kidnappings have become "a pretty regular hazard for
journalists in [the Russian republic of] Chechnya," Cooper says.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper says Pearl's case is the first she knows of since Polk in which
a U.S. journalist was kidnapped, "apparently for political ends," and
then murdered. But she says that in recent years, an unknown number of
local journalists have been assassinated in Argentina, Algeria and Sierra
Leone, usually "in reprisal for their writing." Her organization has also
documented numerous kidnappings of journalists during the drug wars and
related conflicts in Colombia, and at least one of these resulted in
death.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,400 journalists have been killed on the job since 1812,
according to the Freedom Forum, which has erected a 37-foot-high
glass-and-steel monument to them in Freedom Park in Arlington, Va. One of
these casualties was Mark Kellogg, a freelance newspaper reporter who
accompanied Gen. George Armstrong Custer and the 7th Cavalry to the
Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876 and wound up the only civilian casualty
in that massacre.</TE>
<TE>   More than 700 of the journalists died covering wars--66 in World War
II, 65 in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Four Los Angeles Times reporters have been killed in the line of
duty--three overseas, one in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1992 and 2001, 399 journalist were killed "because of their
work," according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also says 118 journalists were in prison at the end of
2001, up from 81 the previous year, and there is little doubt that war,
civil unrest, rampant crime and repressive regimes in several countries
have made the practice of journalism abroad more dangerous than ever.</TE>

<HD>School Friends Mourn Reporter</HD>
<DH>Tribute: Daniel Pearl was smart, humorous and gentle, his
classmates from Encino and Stanford say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<AU>GARRETT THEROLF</AU>
<AU>KARIMA A. HAYNES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From his childhood in Encino through his college days at Stanford,
Daniel Pearl displayed brilliance, humor and compassion, some who knew
him said.</LD>
<LD>   "The image that keeps coming to my mind is that he was the most gentle
person I had ever met," Richard Moss, 38, said of the slain Wall Street
Journal reporter who had been his classmate at Lanai Road Elementary
School and Portola Middle School. "That's why it is so hard for me to
understand how someone whose character was so gentle could have met such
a brutal and nasty fate."</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Gill, 38, met his future best friend on the first day of fourth
grade at Lanai Road Elementary. Pearl agreed to join a club Gill started
called the Bees, whose members poked schoolmates with wire twist ties.
Gill said the club dissolved partly because "Danny didn't like to sting
people."</LD>
<TE>   Gill said that Pearl, despite being a top student, was not outwardly
competitive. The two were scolded at the end of the school year by their
high school trigonometry teacher for not working to their potential, Gill
said.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me a slacker, then he said to Danny, 'You, you just did the
bare minimum to get an A,' " Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl did not argue with the teacher's assessment but saw it as an
accomplishment. "When Danny heard that, he thought it was the greatest
thing. He said, 'Cool,' and walked out. The teacher just shook his head.
Danny just wasn't impressed by authority."</TE>
<TE>   Gill, a San Francisco lawyer, said that although he and Pearl were
among a group of students who expected to go to college and succeed,
Pearl did not talk about career ambitions. When Gill visited Pearl in
college, the two were mainly interested in the bawdy, subversive Freak
Brothers comic books and finding ways to get beer despite being underage.</TE>
<TE>   When Pearl began work at the Wall Street Journal in Atlanta, Gill
said, he realized during a taxi ride to his first interview that he had
forgotten to wear a belt. Pearl persuaded the cabdriver to lend him his.</TE>
<TE>   "He was sophisticated, but in an unsophisticated way. He disarmed
people," Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, was abducted in the Pakistani port city of Karachi on Jan.
23 while investigating local ties between alleged "shoe bomber" Richard
C. Reid and Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's Jewish background compounded the anxiety of his family and
friends during his captivity. His parents, Judea and Ruth, immigrated
from Israel in the 1950s. But Gill said his classmate seldom discussed
his faith. "He was definitely not religious. His family was never highly
observant," Gill said.</TE>
<TE>   Local tributes surfaced as news of Pearl's death spread in his
hometown. The Los Angeles City Council adjourned Friday in Pearl's
memory, and a message of remembrance scrolled across the marquee of
Birmingham High School in Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   When former Lanai Road Principal Larry Marquardt, 78, of Northridge
heard news reports that the kidnapped reporter was from Encino, he was
heartbroken to learn that it was Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   "He was such a great student. He was so alert and so well liked,"
Marquardt said, fighting tears. He recalled that Pearl belonged to a
tight-knit group whose members remained friends through high school.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Artinian, 38, of Agoura Hills, who played in the school band with
Pearl at Portola Middle School in Encino, remembered Pearl as a
competitive musician.</TE>
<TE>   At Birmingham High, Pearl was an academic standout. He was a National
Merit Scholar who earned a Bank of America award for excellence in social
studies. He was one of five student commencement speakers in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "Danny was just a good person. No one could say a bad thing about
him," said Mike Saunders of Westlake Village, who attended elementary,
middle and high school with Pearl. "He wasn't a character out of 'Fast
Times at Ridgemont High.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, Marion Lewenstein, a retired Stanford communications professor
who taught Pearl, said he stood out even among the university's bright
students. "He had a certain flair without being boisterous, loud or
aggressive. He had a sly sense of humor."</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's responses to a freshman survey revealed that sense of humor,
Lewenstein said. Asked to identify his strengths and weaknesses, Pearl
replied, "My biggest problem is that I get lazy (I'm allowed to say that
now that I've been accepted, right?). I try to give 100% to what I'm
doing. My problem is my attention span doesn't always keep up with me."</TE>
<TE>   However, he was deeply committed to his academic work. He spent months
on a project detailing the history of how the White House controls
information when the president is seriously ill or wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Lewenstein recalled Pearl's academic interests as unusually broad. A
communications major, he nevertheless took graduate-level mathematics
courses, including work in artificial intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's family remained in seclusion Friday. The New Orleans French
Quarter-style home with an intricate ironwork balcony had sheets of white
paper taped over the windows and glass doors.</TE>
<TE>   A family spokesman made a brief statement to reporters Thursday
saying, "Danny was a walking sunshine of truth, humor, friendship and
compassion. We grieve with the many who have known him in his life and we
weep for a world that must reckon with his death."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Wall Street Journal said a fund has been set up
for the family and their charities: Daniel Pearl Family Foundation, care
of the Wall Street Journal, P.O. Box 300, Princeton, NJ 08543.</TE>

<HD>7 Missing in Philippine Crash</HD>

<AU>AL JACINTO</AU>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines
</DL>
<LD>A U.S. general said Friday that no survivors have been located from
a helicopter that crashed into the sea with 10 U.S. military personnel
aboard during an anti-terrorism campaign in the southern Philippines.</LD>
<LD>   "We have found no survivors . . . and there are seven personnel that
are still unaccounted for," said Brig. Gen. Donald Wurster, head of U.S.
forces participating in a joint exercise with Philippine troops. "We hope
they are alive, and we are doing everything with our Philippine friends
to find them."</LD>
<LD>   The bodies of three people who had been aboard the MH-47 Chinook were
recovered from the deep, shark-infested Mindanao Sea. The search for
seven others was continuing, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Philippine Gen. Roy Cimatu, chief of this country's Southern Command,
had said earlier that three survivors had been rescued by vessels in the
area. That erroneous report apparently spread when witnesses mistook
rescuers from a second helicopter for the crash victims.</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen in the area said the doomed helicopter appeared to catch
fire before it hit the water. Officials said there was no sign that
hostile fire brought down the copter.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no indication of anything amiss before this thing
happened," Wurster told reporters at a military base here. "All we know
is that the helicopters were flying back from a routine transit mission
and one of them crashed for an unknown reason."</TE>
<TE>   Eight crew members and two military passengers were aboard the
helicopter that went down.</TE>
<TE>   Both Chinooks were taking part in a joint exercise aimed at
eradicating the Islamic rebel gang Abu Sayyaf on Basilan island in the
southern Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   The gang, which has been holding U.S. missionaries Martin and Gracia
Burnham hostage since May, is said to have ties to Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   For the military exercises, which could last up to a year, 160 U.S.
Special Forces troops have been deployed to Basilan island in the first
expansion of the U.S. war against terrorism beyond Afghanistan. An
additional 500 U.S. troops will provide support for the operation from
Zamboanga and the central city of Cebu.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other war games, the U.S. forces are armed for self-defense and
will accompany Philippine troops in the combat zone during what officials
describe as training missions on Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   The two helicopters had just finished transporting the last of the
Special Forces troops and equipment to Basilan. The aircraft were
returning to Mactan air base near Cebu when the crash occurred about 2:30
a.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to search for survivors until we figure out that there
are none," Wurster said.</TE>

<LD>Military special forces swarmed into an army base outside this
sweltering frontier town Friday, three years after the government ceded
it to leftist rebels along with thousands of square miles of surrounding
territory.</LD>
<LD>   About 900 soldiers from the Colombian army's Rapid Deployment Force
began landing at the base in Blackhawk helicopters about 1 a.m. By dawn,
they had secured the abandoned facility.</LD>
<LD>   The troops met little rebel resistance. Three helicopters took hits,
resulting in injuries to a pilot and two crewmen, according to armed
forces chief Gen. Fernando Tapias.</LD>
<TE>   There were scattered reports of clashes elsewhere, and rebels blew up
transmission towers to cut all power to the vast zone that had been ceded
to them for peace talks. Government officials, meanwhile, began
investigating accounts saying that several villagers had been killed and
maimed by a stray bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The newly arrived troops trumpeted their return, the first step of a
dangerous new phase in Colombia's nearly 40-year-old internal conflict.
President Andres Pastrana called off peace negotiations Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we have retaken the zone for the country," said Gen. Jorge
Enrique Mora, the commander of Colombia's army. "There will be no more
attacks or threats or terror in the zone."</TE>
<TE>   Though the takeover of the zone's de facto capital began smoothly, the
hard work of securing the entire region, which is more than twice the
size of New Jersey, remained.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels--members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC--have run the area for almost 40 years. They spent the last three
years, they say, constructing airstrips and building or fixing more than
600 miles of roads.</TE>
<TE>   They also vastly expanded their presence in the zone, building tunnels
and increasing their number to about 5,000, which is about a third of the
rebel force.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have grown in strength during three years of fruitless
talks. The FARC has expanded its presence to every province in the nation
and has formed militias in the cities. And the military, thanks in part
to U.S. training and equipment, has greatly increased its ability to move
quickly and strike hard.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides also appear ready to unleash all their might in an effort
to end a deadly conflict in which the Colombian military and right-wing
paramilitary groups have fought against the FARC and a smaller leftist
army.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. provides Colombia with money, helicopters and troop training
to fight the nation's vast drug production system. But it has become
increasingly drawn into the civil conflict as the lines have blurred
between drug trafficking and the guerrillas and paramilitary groups, who
all finance their activities with narcotics profits.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, in a communique issued Thursday, angrily criticized the
Colombian "oligarchy" for warmongering, saying that authorities have no
interest in meeting FARC demands, such as full unemployment benefits for
the millions out of work in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "The rupture was a demand of the military, economic guilds, the media,
some presidential candidates and the U.S. Embassy, in their haste to not
achieve the changes that the moment demands," read the communique, which
appeared to be signed by six rebel commanders and was distributed to
media outlets here. There was no way to verify it.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday, helicopters continued to thunder over San Vicente del
Caguan, which was making do with neither power nor water. The low rumble
of generators could be heard everywhere. The air was filled with dense
gray smoke, the product of the traditional slash-and-burn farming that
takes place each February.</TE>
<TE>   Residents hung white flags for peace, and hundreds gathered in the
main square to demand security from national officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very happy that they are back," said Horace Ochoa, a 57-year-old
groundskeeper who made his way along the highway with a ragged horse and
a bucketful of grain. "The FARC tried to take this place, but they
weren't able to."</TE>
<TE>   Mora, the army commander, said the state planned to establish a full
presence in the zone in the next few days, restoring the judges, police
and district attorneys who were removed three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   He also took pains to assure residents that the military would not act
against them. Locals have been terrified that their long association with
the guerrillas would make them targets of reprisals from both the
military and its frequent partners, the right-wing paramilitary groups,
which commit the majority of the country's massacres.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers standing outside the newly seized battalion headquarters in
the morning appeared relaxed and confident. Minesweeping crews crept
along the edges of the road. More troops are expected to arrive in coming
days as the special forces secure the town's airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   "We are proud to be the first ones in. We are extremely happy to be
here," said Pvt. Henry Bocanegra.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dead and wounded from a small village that apparently
was accidentally bombed Thursday by Colombian air force jets arrived late
Friday at the local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said the bombing, which was still unconfirmed, had left
three people dead and five injured in La Ye, about five hours north of
San Vicente del Caguan. One young woman, identified as Yama Keni Lozada,
15, died before reaching the hospital, her legs apparently mauled by a
bomb fragment.</TE>
<TE>   A hospital official who did not want to be identified said metal
fragments removed from the wounded appeared to be from a manufactured
explosive device and not the rebels' homemade bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Family members said they had spent most of the day in a desperate
search for help. Neither the International Committee of the Red Cross nor
local officials would lend their ambulances to make the trip to La Ye, in
rebel-held territory, 170 miles south of the nation's capital, Bogota.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross and the local hospital finally sent an ambulance after
villagers transported the dead and wounded to a halfway point.</TE>
<TE>   One man who said he had witnessed the bombing said two Colombian Kfir
jets flew over La Ye about 11:30 a.m. Thursday, dropping eight bombs near
a site where men were building a road.</TE>
<TE>   The man, who did not want to be identified, said the bombs killed a
farmer and his 2-year-old son after striking a tree above their home. He
said that the boy's mother suffered a leg wound and that a 2-month-old
baby she was holding received superficial cuts.</TE>
<TE>   As a pickup truck filled with bodies arrived in town late Friday, a
crowd gathered. Lozada's boyfriend, through choking sobs, said planes
bombed them while they were working in the fields.</TE>
<TE>   The angered crowd followed the truck to the cemetery. "Why are they
killing us?" some began shouting. "We are not guerrillas."</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, Canada
</DL>
<LD>Police filed first-degree murder charges Friday against the owner
of a dilapidated pig farm that has become the focus of a search for 50
Vancouver women who have disappeared since the early 1980s and are feared
dead.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Pickton, 52, was charged in connection with the deaths of two
of the women, but the inquiry was continuing, the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police told a news conference at the farm in Port Coquitlam, a suburb of
Vancouver.</LD>
<LD>   Police, who raided Pickton's farm Feb. 5, refused to say what evidence
prompted the arrest.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly all of the missing women were drug addicts who worked in the
sex trade in Vancouver's downtown east side, one of Canada's poorest
neighborhoods. The first disappearance took place in 1983.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Imposes Travel Curb on Mugabe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The United States imposed travel restrictions on Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe and his aides Friday to protest an election
campaign that it said was "marred by political violence and
intimidation."</LD>
<LD>   President Bush said he took the action "in light of the political and
humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and the continued failure of President
Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwean government officials and others to support the
rule of law."</LD>
<LD>   The order said Bush suspended entry into the United States of Mugabe
and senior members of his government and their families, and people who
through their business dealings benefit from the policies of Zimbabwe's
current government.</LD>
<TE>   The suspension is effective immediately, Bush said, and could be
terminated at the discretion of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "In light of the current situation, the United States is imposing
targeted sanctions on senior Zimbabwean officials because conditions for
a transparent election process in Zimbabwe have eroded," said White House
Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   The European Union on Monday imposed a visa ban on Mugabe and 19 of
his top officials because of the way Zimbabwe treated observers sent to
monitor presidential elections set for March 9-10. The EU also froze the
overseas assets of the 20 Zimbabwean leaders and withdrew the observer
mission.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, like the European Union, has been strongly critical
of Mugabe's restrictions on the media and of intimidation of the
opposition by his supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said the travel suspensions would be lifted if Mugabe
allowed the elections to proceed legitimately.</TE>

<HD>Italy Convicts 4 Linked to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Justice: Tunisian immigrants are given sentences of up to five
years for conspiracy. Their 'fast-track' trial reduced their terms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILAN, Italy
</DL>
<LD>An Italian judge convicted four Tunisian immigrants of criminal
association Friday, including one identified as a key operative for the
Al Qaeda terrorist network in Europe, and sent them to prison for up to
five years.</LD>
<LD>   They were the first post-Sept. 11 sentences handed down to any of the
dozens of Muslim men who stand accused in several European countries of
collaborating with Osama bin Laden's network.</LD>
<LD>   But Italian legal peculiarities lightened the punishment. At the time
of the arrests last April and October, Italy lacked an anti-terrorism law
for use against militants of foreign-based groups and resorted instead to
a conspiracy charge that had been designed to catch Mafiosi. Also, the
Tunisians were able to opt for a "fast-track" trial with reduced
penalties.</LD>
<TE>   The closed two-day trial and terse verdict produced no visible drama
and shed little light on either the defendants or their life in an
Islamic underground that came under intense police pressure after the
terror attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in Western-style clothes, Essid Sami ben Khemais, the purported
Al Qaeda logistics man code-named Saber, and his compatriots listened
impassively to Judge Giovanna Verga's verdict, then were handcuffed and
led back to jail, defense lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   All four were convicted of selling false passports and identity cards
for $500 per set to young men headed for Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan,
of organizing illegal immigration into Italy and of associating with
criminal intent to obtain and transport arms, explosives and chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers had asked for an expedited trial, which in Italy
allows for a limited amount of evidence to be introduced during a closed
hearing and for a prison sentence reduced by about one-third if a
defendant is convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Then the judge knocked a year off the sentence the prosecution had
sought for Ben Khemais, in part because he and the other defendants
weren't found in possession of weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Khemais and Bouchoucha Mokhtar were sentenced to five years each.
Belgacem Mohammed ben Aouaid and Charaabi Tarek received four-year
sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said they would appeal the convictions.</TE>
<TE>   According to Italian investigators, Ben Khemais, 33, moved to Italy in
1998 after two years of terrorist training in Afghanistan. The
investigators believe that Al Qaeda sent him to supervise terrorist
operations in Europe. Spanish police suspect that he may have met Mohamed
Atta, a suspected mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, early last year in
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Khemais and two co-defendants were arrested April 5 in a raid on
his apartment near Malpensa airport north of Milan. Italian officials say
the apartment housed a terrorist cell loosely connected to similar
operations in Germany, Spain, Britain, France and Belgium that sent
Muslim recruits to train in Afghanistan, who then return to Europe ready
to strike Western targets at Al Qaeda's behest.</TE>
<TE>   None of the defendants convicted Friday was accused of being involved
in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But police offered a 300-page report alleging a conspiracy to obtain
or make weapons and use them to terrorize Europe. The report was based on
transcripts from four months of wiretaps and bugged conversations between
Ben Khemais' apartment and Al Qaeda suspects in the German cities of
Munich and Frankfurt, in Brussels and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The transcripts are filled with talk of the logistics of procuring and
selling fake passports, identity cards, driver's licenses and other
documents. In one conversation, the men discussed putting poison gas in
cans of tomatoes. In others, they discussed chemicals for making bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Milan prosecutor Stefano Dambruoso, who brought charges against the
defendants, called Friday's verdict "the first to recognize the existence
on European territory of a cell that had strong links with a base in
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   The defense disputed that claim.</TE>
<TE>   In court, the defendants claimed to be guilty of nothing more than
trafficking in false documents, and only for money to survive. Recalling
that police first stopped him as he siphoned diesel fuel from a truck,
Ben Khemais asked the judge, "How can a terrorist be reduced to that?"</TE>
<TE>   "I am a practicing Muslim, not a terrorist," he was quoted as saying.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a criminal association, just a group of young men,"
defense attorney Antonio Nebuloni said he told the court. The state's
case, he argued, was based entirely on wiretapped conversations full of
the loose talk one could hear in Europe "in the home of any non-European
immigrant without a steady job--that the West is disgusting, that we
should burn everyone."</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't make them terrorists," he added. "Terrorists have arms,
cyanide, bombs." The police "couldn't find those weapons, so it accused
them of 'terrorism with documents.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dambruoso, the prosecutor, told the court that people who provide
false documents to terrorists are just as dangerous as terrorists
carrying arms.</TE>
<TE>   Under Italian law, Judge Verga has 90 days to spell out reasons for
her verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Since October, Italy has adopted an anti-terrorism law mandating
stiffer sentences than the ones given Friday. But Dambruoso said he was
satisfied that an anti-terrorist climate in Italy had prompted a more
severe punishment than would have been the case before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Three other Tunisians allegedly belonging to the Milan cell went on
trial separately here Monday on the same charge of criminal association.</TE>
<TE>   Similar cases, based on overlapping investigations into scattered Al
Qaeda-linked cells, are headed for trial in several European countries.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, prosecutors have charged a Moroccan as an accomplice of
the Hamburg cell that allegedly carried out the Sept. 11 hijackings. In
Spain, eight men are accused of being accomplices of the hijackers and a
hub of recruitment, finance, fake documents and shelter for Al Qaeda
operatives.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in France, Britain and Belgium have opened cases against a
Tunisian-led network accused of aiding two Brussels-based suicide bombers
who assassinated Ahmed Shah Masoud, an anti-Taliban guerrilla leader, in
Afghanistan on Sept. 9. Suspects in half a dozen countries await trial
for aborted plots to bomb the U.S. Embassy in Paris and stage a chemical
gas attack in Strasbourg, France.</TE>

<HD>China Censors Bush Speech in Print</HD>
<DH>Asia: President's remarks on freedom and faith are edited out of a
transcript released by a state-run news agency.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese government responded to President Bush's call for
religious tolerance Friday by promptly editing out his remarks on freedom
and faith in its transcript of a speech that Bush delivered on live
national television.</LD>
<LD>   Before the U.S. leader had even boarded Air Force One to return to
Washington on Friday afternoon, China's state-controlled media put out
their version of the morning address, in which Bush spoke to an audience
of university students.</LD>
<LD>   Almost half the speech--large chunks extolling American liberty and
urging China to relax its political and religious restrictions--was
simply hacked out in the transcript released by the official New China
News Agency. The heavy censorship prompted indignant complaints on the
Internet from people who demanded that the full text be restored.</LD>
<TE>   "Why must the New China News Agency kid itself?" someone using the
name Crawler asked in one chat room. "Does striking out someone's words
mean the person never said them?"</TE>
<TE>   Others took to posting the censored portions for others to read. "The
Chinese media always distort the facts," another cyber-citizen wrote.
"Everyone ought to compare the live remarks with the subsequent
transcript."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's speech at Qinghua University in Beijing, along with a half-hour
question-and-answer session afterward, was broadcast Friday morning on
China's premier television channel, which reaches hundreds of millions of
households.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second time an American president has had the
opportunity of addressing the Chinese people directly, and one of
Beijing's most widely read newspapers publicized the event beforehand.</TE>
<TE>   But the censored transcript demonstrated the ambivalence of the
Communist regime toward the United States. Although top leaders publicly
advocate stronger ties with Washington and agreed to the White House's
request for live air time, they remain sensitive to any criticism of
their rule.</TE>
<TE>   The excised portions of Bush's speech contained praise for America's
civic spirit and its status as "a beacon of hope" for people around the
world. Bush's criticism of some Chinese textbooks' portrayal of U.S.
society also was dropped. So were his comments on his personal faith, his
call for an end to religious persecution here, his description of the
Statue of Liberty and his declaration that freedom need not mean chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Even his praise for the courage of the firefighters and police
officers who died trying to save victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks on the U.S. got the ax.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that remained was a brief civics lesson on the separation of
powers in U.S. government and the fact that political authority derives
from a "free vote of the people." But Bush's wish that the Chinese might
one day choose their own national leaders was expunged.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the speech did get beamed live and uncensored over the airwaves
Friday morning, potentially seen by hundreds of millions of viewers.</TE>
<TE>   And state-run media have spoken warmly of Bush's visit as an important
event in Sino-U.S. relations, even though the Chinese generally have been
skeptical of Bush, whom they regard as less friendly toward their country
than was President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Talks between Bush and President Jiang Zemin were described as
"positive, constructive and fruitful" by the Foreign Ministry, although
no major agreements were reached. In addition, Bush had a chance Friday
to meet Vice President Hu Jintao, who is expected to become president
next year.</TE>
<TE>   The two men spoke briefly before Hu introduced Bush to the audience at
Qinghua. Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said Hu thanked Bush for an
invitation to visit the U.S., which he has accepted.</TE>
<TE>   After the speech at Qinghua, a school often billed as China's MIT,
some of those who attended gave Bush fairly high marks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Bush spoke well. Not that I agreed with everything he said,"
said Zhang Kaicun, 49, a worker at Qinghua who was allowed to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's comments about religious persecution in China didn't ring true
to Zhang. "More and more people are turning to religion in China. I know
a lot of religious people," he said. "They're Buddhists, and they're
under no pressure whatsoever."</TE>
<TE>   During the question-and-answer period, the first two of six questions
by students grilled Bush on his policy toward Taiwan, the biggest
sticking point in U.S.-China relations. Beijing regards the island as its
rightful territory.</TE>
<TE>   The questions, both of them applauded by the audience, reflected the
growing nationalism among Chinese youth, a sentiment actively fostered by
the government. Four years ago, at a similar event, students at Qinghua's
rival institution, Beijing University, asked Clinton whether, beneath his
smiles, the U.S. was intent on containing China.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Bush said he is committed to helping Taiwan defend itself

<HD>GAO Goes to Court to Get Cheney Data</HD>
<DH>Disclosure: It's the first time the watchdog agency has sued the
executive branch. White House vows a legal battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The clash between a congressional watchdog agency and the White
House escalated Friday, as lawyers for the General Accounting Office
sought a court order that would force Vice President Dick Cheney to
reveal with whom he met as the administration formed its national energy
plan.</LD>
<LD>   In its first lawsuit against the executive branch, the GAO said it has
a legal right to know who attended meetings of Cheney's National Energy
Policy Development Group.</LD>
<LD>   Congress created the GAO in 1921 as an auditing unit, and its law
"broadly authorizes GAO to investigate all matters relating to the use of
public funds," David M. Walker, the comptroller general, said in his
lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   That includes the authority to examine not just how money was spent
but also how government officials made official policy, the lawsuit
argues.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Cheney balked at the rather routine document request from
Walker's agency and said it threatened "to intrude into the heart of
executive deliberations."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and his advisors were determined to erect a legal
barrier around the White House, in contrast to the Clinton era, when
investigators succeeded in prying secrets from the administration.</TE>
<TE>   Bush and Cheney chose to draw a line against the GAO probe, although
they did so when the now-failed Enron Corp. was a high-flying energy
trader based in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Enron's spectacular collapse has raised the political
stakes in the case of Walker vs. Cheney. It puts an even brighter
spotlight on the administration's close ties to Texas energy executives,
including top Enron officials.</TE>
<TE>   "We take this step reluctantly," Walker said in filing the lawsuit.
"Nevertheless, given GAO's responsibility to Congress and the American
people, we have no other choice."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, the Los Angeles Democrat who first sought the
information along with Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), called the legal
action a "remarkable and sad" development.</TE>
<TE>   "The American people and Congress have an obvious right to know which
lobbyists and special interests tried to influence the vice president's
energy policy," Waxman said.</TE>
<TE>   The White House, which has acknowledged that Cheney or members of the
task force met six times last year with representatives of Enron, said it
will vigorously fight the legal battle. If necessary, administration
officials said, they will invoke "executive privilege," the doctrine that
was discredited by the Nixon administration during the Watergate scandal
of the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected this [lawsuit], and we are ready to defend our principles
in court," White House spokeswoman Anne Womack said. "This goes to the
heart of the presidency and to the ability of the president and vice
president to receive candid, discreet advice."</TE>
<TE>   White House lawyers contend that the GAO is going beyond its legal
authority. While the accounting office can examine how agencies spend
their money, the White House is not an "agency," they say, and Cheney's
task force was not spending money.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the White House lawyers argue, Waxman and Dingell do not
represent Congress or even a congressional committee. As Democrats, they
are in the minority in the House of Representatives and therefore do not
speak for the body as a whole, the attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   They will urge a federal judge to reject the GAO's claim on these
narrow grounds. If those arguments fail, the administration is prepared
to raise the stakes by claiming that the Constitution shields the
president from congressional meddling.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson has been tapped to head the
White House defense.</TE>
<TE>   Because Olson argues regularly before the Supreme Court, his
appointment signals that the administration is determined to fight the
battle all the way through the legal system. He has a month to file a
response to the GAO's suit in a federal district court in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just one chapter in the larger effort by the Bush
administration to reassert the prerogatives of the presidency," said Duke
University law professor Christopher Schroeder, who served as a Justice
Department legal advisor during the Clinton administration. "Usually
these disputes get hashed out at a much lower level, but this
administration is saying, 'We're going to stand on principle and not
yield.' "</TE>
<TE>   The administration took that stance last summer. "But that was before
Enron," Schroeder said, questioning whether the make-up of the energy
task force is the best test case for a legal fight.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate lawsuit, Larry Klayman, who heads the private watchdog
group Judicial Watch, has asked U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan to
order Cheney to reveal information about his task force on the grounds
that it is a federal advisory committee. Congress has said these official
advisory panels must disclose who participates.</TE>
<TE>   "We support what they did, but our lawsuit was brought under a law the
Supreme Court has already said is constitutional," Klayman said.</TE>
<TE>   And Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, is considering seeking information on
Cheney's task force directly through his panel. His request could
sidestep the administration's claim that Waxman does not speak for a
congressional committee and the GAO does not speak for Congress.</TE>

<HD>Olympic Side Trips for Fun, Games</HD>
<DH>Leisure: Wendover, Nev., offers a welcome respite for Salt Lake
visitors interested in Vegas-style gambling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WENDOVER, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>This is where Olympians come to go for the gold, one quarter at a
time. It's where a handful of Asian media stars hang out till dawn before
rushing lickety-split back down I-80 to Salt Lake City. It's where
foreign visitors venture to play games in which luck counts more than
talent or training.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Wendover, a pint-sized border town with five casinos, two
strip joints and 24-7 Nevada action. The town is short on culture and
tourist attractions, but it's just 120 miles west of Salt Lake City,
making it the unofficial Olympic refuge for athletes and visitors needing
a jolt of double-down fun without an overlay of family values.</LD>
<LD>   "So, Becky, what are the things a tourist ought to see here?" Eugene
Hsiao, an Olympic visitor from Phoenix, asked a blackjack dealer at the
Silver Smith Casino.</LD>
<TE>   "You're looking at it right now," she said. "You're sitting in the
middle of it. You want a hit?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually the Winter Games haven't proved as much of a bonanza as
casino executives had hoped. But after a slow start, Wendover has been
discovered by enough Olympic visitors to put a blip in the town's
gambling revenues and fill up casinos that might otherwise have been
sleepy quiet on weekday nights.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian women's hockey team showed up in a bus the other night,
and what the players lacked in funds they made up for in enthusiasm,
wildly cheering each payoff at the slot machines. American bobsledders
have been around too, as have two professional players on the Canadian
ice hockey team who lost tens of thousands of dollars, one at blackjack,
one at craps.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking serious money," said Michael Devine of State Line
Casino, which has been pocketing Utah's gambling dollars since 1926. He
declined to identify the players but noted that Canadian hockey official
Wayne Gretzky has criticized the performance of his team, which was tied
Monday by the underdog Czechs, 3-3. The team rebounded and will play for
the gold medal Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The largest foreign contingent in Wendover is 45 Russian
fans--businessmen and their wives from Amur, a Russian gold-mining
company--who are staying at the Silver Smith and making the 90-minute
trip to Salt Lake every day on a chartered bus to watch the hockey
competition. The hotel's chef had to scurry the other morning to meet his
guests' breakfast request: garlic mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables and
fresh strawberries.</TE>
<TE>   "We send a lot of our people to the U.S. on vacation," said Victor
Lopatyuk, Amur's president. "Traditionally it's to Hawaii and Las Vegas.
This year we just substituted Salt Lake for Las Vegas because of the
Olympics. Why Wendover? Because it's the closest casino. This is a
mini-Las Vegas. Very mini."</TE>
<TE>   It's also a town that didn't raise prices to capitalize on Olympic
traffic. While Utah gouged mercilessly--the Marriott Courtyard in Provo,
for instance, jacked room rates from $99 to $225 a night for the
Olympics--Wendover resorts such as State Line held steady. Weekday rooms
still go for $19 to $24 a night, a shrimp cocktail for 99 cents and a
12-ounce New York strip steak for $7.95.</TE>
<TE>   "Salt Lake," Guido Koenen, an Olympic spectator from Holland, said
with a pull of the slot handle, "is very nice, very clean, very friendly.
My only complaint is smoking. It's hard to do anywhere, and after a nice
meal you'd really like to have just one cigarette. You can't. You have to
stand outside in the cold. That's terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Wendover might have enjoyed more high-roller action had it not been
for the IOC president, Jacques Rogge, who is trying to clean up the
committee's jet-setting image. He told members that this year they were
expected to remain in town and attend Olympic events.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Executive Limousine in Reno sent four stretch Lincolns to
Wendover to shuttle visitors between Wendover and Salt Lake and to meet
corporate jets flying into the town's World War II military base, a
popular airport because it is outside the no-fly security zone
surrounding the Olympic venue.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Wendover's 3.5 million annual visitors come from the Salt Lake
Valley, where residents are teased with interstate billboards of what
awaits across the border: "#1 in hot action," "Looser slots," "Hot
action, good food." Because Mormons are asked to abstain from alcohol,
nicotine and caffeine and not gamble, the proximity of Wendover has long
been an edgy subject, and casino executives remain respectful of the
sensitivities since most of their customers are Mormons.</TE>
<TE>   "For instance, I don't keep any [adult] magazines in the gift shop, as
a Vegas casino would," said Devine, president of State Line Casino.
"Everyone knows, of course, that Nevada is different. But we'd like our
customers to come out, have a good meal, have fun, maybe put $25 in the
slots and not feel they're doing anything wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they'll feel a little naughty, but we don't want them to feel
guilty."</TE>

<HD>Washington Monument Reopens to Long Lines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN GILL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>On the 270th anniversary of George Washington's birth, tourists
Friday could once again ascend the interior of the marble obelisk that
celebrates his life to take in panoramic views of the city that bears his
name.</LD>
<LD>   The reopening of the Washington Monument, closed since December 2000,
capped a four-year effort to restore the memorial's marble stones,
replace its elevator and refurbish its observation deck. Security has
also been increased as part of the $10.5-million project, although
efforts to beef up safety measures at the site began in 1998 after the
bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa.</LD>
<LD>   The reopening marks the return of one more tourist draw in the
nation's capital, where many attractions closed after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. Many are open again, with some limits. Tours of the
White House, for example, are available only to schoolchildren and
restricted to about 800 visitors a day.</LD>
<TE>   At ceremonies Friday to commemorate Washington's birthday and welcome
the public back, officials said the memorial is a renewed symbol of
American freedom in the wake of the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our national treasures serve as great reminders of our natural
strength," Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton said.</TE>
<TE>   But seeing the city from atop the 555-foot-high structure may take
planning--and patience. Entry times are set in advance and visitors must
be in groups of 25; they must pass through metal detectors and have their
bags searched.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Friday's official 1 p.m. opening, long lines snaked around
the building. By midmorning, all tickets had been snapped up for the
tours available before the scheduled closing four hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the restrictions, officials said they hope the monument will
provide further incentive for tourists to return to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said the monument's opening
signals the return of the capital, and the country, to normality.</TE>
<TE>   "What could be more normal than a ride up the Washington Monument?"
she asked. "Synonymous with the city itself, it soars magnificently as if
to invite back the American people to their capital city."</TE>
<TE>   The 14-month closure was worth the wait, the delegate said, noting
that the building has been a "work in progress" for most of its life.
Construction began in 1845 but was not completed until 1884. The
reopening Friday ends the third phase of a process that started when the
monument was encased in custom-made lighted scaffolding, designed by
architect Michael Graves, for the restoration of the masonry.</TE>
<TE>   Restored commemorative stones inside the elevator shaft--once only on
view to those climbing the monument's 897 steps--can be seen from the new
elevator, said Stephen Lorenzetti, chief of resource management for
Washington-area parks.</TE>
<TE>   The elevator slows during two portions of the ride up, and the glass
changes from opaque to clear via an electric charge, giving the effect
that the elevator walls simply vanish.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see much more of the monument itself than you would have
previously," park ranger Bob Healy said. "It makes for a much better
experience."</TE>
<TE>   Further changes were made to the observation deck, including larger
windows and a new floor, Lorenzetti said. Glass now protects the
monument's walls on the deck.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenzetti said the Park Service plans to replace the temporary
security measures with a permanent visitors' center and screening
facility that would connect to the monument by a tunnel. Barricades would
be replaced by a recessed walkway.</TE>
<TE>   Students from Anthony Bowen Elementary School in Washington were the
first to experience the monument Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Paula Coniglio, 42, a schoolteacher from Rochester, N.Y., said she and
friend Chip Doyle, 42, of Arlington, Va., had arrived at 8 a.m. to get
tickets. They didn't mind the wait.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm leaving tomorrow, so I had to come today," Coniglio said of her
first visit to the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   The monument is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Free tickets are
available on a first-come, first-served basis outside the monument. For a
fee, reservations can be made online at
http://http://reservations.nps.gov or by calling (800) 967-2283. The cost
is $1.50 per ticket plus a handling charge of 50 cents per order.</TE>

<LD>An unkempt and agitated Andrea Yates wailed in despair when mental
health experts met her in a Houston jail the day after she drowned her
five children last summer, a psychiatrist testified as the defense began
making the case she was too ill to be held responsible for the crime.</LD>
<LD>   Harris County Jail psychiatrist Melissa Ferguson said she prescribed a
powerful sedative for Yates, who told police she killed her children to
punish herself for being a bad mother. She could face the death penalty
if convicted.</LD>

<HD>Testimony Tells of a Casual Murder</HD>
<DH>Trial: Only one of five young men didn't plead guilty to a plot to
rob, carjack and kill two Rhode Island students.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PROVIDENCE, R.I.
</DL>
<LD>On a fine summer night in June 2000, two Rhode Island college
students were out on a date.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, Amy Shute and Jason Burgeson were shot dead at a
partially constructed golf course, victims of a crime whose icy
randomness jarred this hard-edged city. Providence shuddered anew this
week as chilling details of the killings unfolded at the trial of the
only one of the five men who did not plead guilty to a plot to rob,
carjack and murder anyone they happened to find that night.</LD>
<LD>   In a trial that offered an inadvertent study of urban violence,
Kenneth L. Day, 23, spent the week gazing impassively as his former best
friend, Gregory J. Floyd, 21, answered questions from lawyers. Floyd and
three others pleaded guilty after federal prosecutors opted not to seek
the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   "They told me I didn't have to do it," Floyd said the two college
students urged him as he held a gun over their heads. "They were crying."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd pulled the trigger anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no feeling," he said in a voice so cold that some
spectators left the courtroom to compose themselves. "It was just
numbness."</TE>
<TE>   The five carjackers made off with Burgeson's white Ford Explorer after
the shootings. They also pocketed all the money the two victims had on
them, $18.</TE>
<TE>   But Day said from the start that he would not "go down" for the
slayings of Shute and Burgeson, a sheriff who overheard Day talking with
another defendant, testified in federal court Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "You're the one who did it," Sheriff Patrick Keeley said Day told
Floyd.</TE>
<TE>   According to Keeley, Floyd rejoined: "You guys hooked me up to this."</TE>
<TE>   The crime jolted Providence at first because both victims were white.
Race, class and ethnic tensions run high here. And when at least one of
the suspects turned out to be African American, the city steeled itself
for the possibility of a racially motivated murder.</TE>
<TE>   Instead the crime proved to be one of random violence. Floyd, the
first of the carjackers to speak publicly, captivated the courtroom last
week as he described the decision to go looking for someone to rob and
kill.</TE>
<TE>   Though several of them worked occasionally, most of the five young men
spent their days hanging out at a park in the center of Providence.</TE>
<TE>   "All day long, every day they were there, from 10 o'clock in the
morning until sometimes 2 o'clock in the morning," the owner of a pizza
parlor near the park testified Friday.</TE>
<TE>   They launched their scheme by trying to seek out someone who had tried
to buy drugs from one of the five men. When they couldn't locate that
potential victim, they scoured the bus station. Again, they had no luck.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd told the court that he and his friends were looking for someone
prosperous, someone with the right clothes, hairstyle and a confident
stride.</TE>
<TE>   They found a man talking on a cell phone and started to close in. But
the man's friends showed up. Then they tried two women at an automated
teller machine. The women, he said, were obviously inebriated, easy
marks. That plan fizzled when a security guard spotted the five men and
told them to disperse.</TE>
<TE>   Then they saw Shute and Burgeson, chatting on the steps of a downtown
shopping arcade.</TE>
<TE>   "Ooh, ooh, look," Floyd said Day remarked.</TE>
<TE>   The five men confronted Burgeson, 20, and Shute, 21, and flashed their
gun. They forced the pair into the Explorer, then drove
aimlessly--apparently unsure what their next step should be.</TE>
<TE>   And then, asked Joseph L. DeCaporale Jr., the lawyer for Day, "Mr. Day
urged you to kill Amy and Jason?"</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't object to it," Floyd replied. "He suggested it."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Gerard B. Sullivan inquired, "And when did you form the
intent" to kill Burgeson and Shute?</TE>
<TE>   Floyd answered, "I can't really say that I did. It just happened."</TE>
<TE>   Floyd has been sentenced to life in prison without possibility of
parole.</TE>
<TE>   Three others involved--Harry Burdick, 23, Samuel Sanchez, 21, and
Raymond Anderson, 20--have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing.</TE>
<TE>   In court Friday, Burdick's girlfriend said she tried to persuade him
to go home with her that night instead of heading out with his friends.</TE>
<TE>   "I overheard Greg [Floyd] say he wanted to 'jack' someone for his
money," said Brandi Landry. "I told Harry I didn't want him to go with
Greg. I wanted him to come home with me because I knew something was
going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Landry testified that Floyd, for one, was "a very friendly person. And
he loved to steal cars."</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX
</DL>
<LD>A Mexican man was sentenced Friday to 16 years in prison for
smuggling illegal immigrants across the southern Arizona desert, where 14
of them died in the extreme heat.</LD>
<LD>   Jesus Lopez-Ramos pleaded guilty in October to 25 smuggling counts--14
for the men who died and 11 for men who survived the trek in temperatures
reaching 115 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez-Ramos, 21, expressed remorse before U.S. District Judge Susan R.
Bolton imposed the sentence.</LD>
<TE>   "I am very sorry for the fate of the victims and the families," he
said. "My intention was not to lead them to their deaths. My intention
was to lead them across so they could find better lives. I ask for
forgiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Gerald A. Williams said he planned to appeal the
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents found the immigrants May 23 on the Cabeza Prieta
National Wildlife Refuge in the bleak terrain known as the Devil's Path.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Lopez-Ramos of Guadalajara was one of three smugglers
who led a group of about 30 illegal immigrants from Sonoyta, Mexico, into
the United States on May 19.</TE>
<TE>   One smuggler returned to Mexico and the other died.</TE>

<HD>35 Priests Linked to Sex Abuse, Philadelphia Archdiocese Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>The Archdiocese of Philadelphia said Friday it has found "credible
evidence" that 35 priests sexually abused children over five decades and
relieved several of them of their duties.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 children were victims, diocesan spokeswoman Catherine Rossi
said.</LD>
<LD>   Rossi could not say how many of the 35 names had been given to police
when the allegations were made. She said the archdiocese followed state
law.</LD>
<TE>   The archdiocese will not turn over the names of the priests now
because the statute of limitations has expired in all of the cases, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She said that fewer than 10 priests had faced "credible" abuse
allegations years ago and had been working in administrative jobs since
then.</TE>
<TE>   The others were either relieved of their duties, retired, left the
priesthood or died, Rossi said.</TE>
<TE>   One priest, Father Michael Swierzy, 53, pleaded guilty in 1998 to one
count of corrupting the morals of a minor.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese said it reviewed records dating to 1950.</TE>

<HD>Who'll Pitch Radio Drama at UCI?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>Baseball fans may remember Johnny Callison, the Philadelphia
Phillies outfielder who won the 1964 All-Star game with a dramatic,
three-run homer.</LD>
<LD>   His phonetic namesake, Glenn Kalison, will be swinging for the fences
March 3 on "Theatre on the Air," the weekly radio drama program he
founded about 18 months ago on UC Irvine's radio station, KUCI (88.9FM).</LD>
<LD>   Kalison started the Sunday night show as a performing outlet and
learning tool for himself and his fellow student actors in UCI's graduate
school of drama. Now, in his last public performance before graduating
with a master's degree, Kalison will play the hero of "Man on Spikes." He
adapted the radio play from a 1955 baseball novel by Eliot Asinof about a
centerfielder's 16-year struggle to make it to the big leagues.</LD>
<TE>   While honing the 11th original live show in the series, Kalison
wonders whether other student actors will step up to the plate and keep
"Theater on the Air" alive after he leaves in May to pursue an acting
career. He hopes that rookie talent--current first-year acting students
in the three-year graduate program--will fill his spikes and continue
producing the show on the nonprofit, student-run KUCI.</TE>
<TE>   One of his projects between now and graduation is to get newcomers
involved in the remaining broadcasts. "Theatre on the Air" produces about
one live drama each month; vintage recordings of old-time classics such
as "The Shadow" fill the rest of the slots each Sunday at 10 p.m.
Audiences who can't pull in KUCI's signal can hear the show live over the
Internet at www.kuci.org</TE>
<TE>   Julie Espy, the station's general manager, helped Kalison launch the
show in October 2000, and hopes it will continue. "It fulfills our
mission to play things you don't hear elsewhere," she said. "Certainly no
one else in Orange County is doing live radio theater."</TE>
<TE>   Kalison, from New York City, was not a radio drama buff when he
arrived on campus. His studies under Dudley Knight, UCI drama professor
and radio theater veteran who specializes in voice and dialect training,
gave him the idea of starting the show. For the actors, Kalison said, it
has been an outlet for experimenting with accents, playing offbeat
characters and learning microphone techniques. That practice could come
in handy for the voiceover work that sustains many a professional actor
waiting for a stage or screen role.</TE>
<TE>   Professional outlets for radio drama are few, Kalison acknowledges.
But with the advent of satellite radio, which would expand listeners'
choices, he thinks a channel for drama could emerge.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 live shows that "Theatre on the Air" has produced have tested
the staff's ingenuity. One program, "Three Skeleton Key," required a
sound effect that would resemble an army of rats attacking a lighthouse.
A brush scratching on a piece of glass did the trick.</TE>
<TE>   "Theatre on the Air" has done fresh re-creations of existing radio
scripts, including an episode of "The Shadow" and an adaptation of Ray
Bradbury short stores. "Man on Spikes," two hours instead of the usual
one-hour show, reflects Kalison's love of baseball literature.</TE>
<TE>   As an undergraduate he caught for Lehigh University--an experience
that made him realize he was better suited for the stage than the
diamond.</TE>
<TE>   After "Man on Spikes," Kalison plans to produce fresh adaptations of a
couple of classics. Then the future of "Theatre on the Air" will be in
the hands of the school's returning acting students and the radio
station's incoming programming directors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an underused opportunity for storytelling," says Kalison. "Your
imagination's got to do the work, and there's not a lot of that any
more."</TE>
<TE>Check This 'Tommy' to See What's Changed</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, look out you rock 'n' rollers, pretty soon now you're gonna get a
little older," David Bowie sang 31 years ago in his song, "Changes." Baby
Boomers who want to know just how much has changed might look to the
upcoming Fullerton College stage production of "The Who's Tommy."</TE>
<TE>   This version, which plays March 7-14 in the campus theater, comes with
a 15-page study guide designed to bring Pete Townshend's landmark rock
opera into high school classrooms. One generation's soundtrack for
rebellion has turned into another's homework.</TE>
<TE>   The study guide was written by Gary Krinke, the veteran Fullerton
College theater professor who directs the show. Krinke, 53, saw the Who
perform the 1969-vintage "Tommy" in Los Angeles. He chuckled when asked
whether he could have imagined then that high school kids would get class
credit for, watching the rocking saga of a deaf, dumb and blind boy who
parlays his genius for pinball into leadership of a religious cult. "No,"
he said. "And I never thought I would get paid to direct it."</TE>
<TE>   Krinke says his student cast of 53 actors knew next to nothing about
the Who when they got involved in the production. But he says that
appreciate the score, which includes "Pinball Wizard." As an added
attraction, ticket holders--among them high school English and drama
classes attending for course credit--will be able to play pinball for
free in the lobby during intermission. We don't know whether Krinke never
tilts at all, but the Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival's
Western region honored his teaching achievements recently by giving him
its annual Excellence in Theatre Education Award.</TE>
<TE>Rude Guerrilla Company Opens Actors Workshop</TE>
<TE>   The newest player in Orange County theater education is the Rude
Guerrilla Theater Company in Santa Ana. Its Actors Workshop, a weekly
Saturday morning and afternoon soiree for thespians, was launched Feb. 9
at the Empire Theater, 200 N. Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Barton, the storefront theater's artistic director, taught the
first course, a two-part discussion and hands-on workshop based on his
personal acting bible, David Mamet's "True and False: Heresy and Common
Sense for the Actor." The series continues today with the first of two
voice workshops led by company member Susan E. Taylor. The classes cost
$10 per session. Information: (714) 447-4414.</TE>
<TE>Last-Minute Switch Lands Rat Pack in Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert &amp; Sullivan are out and the Rat Pack is in at the Santa Ana
Performing Arts and Event Center. "The Pirates of Penzance" had been
scheduled this month in the Celebrity Dinner Theater, one of three
performance spaces in the lavishly restored former Masonic Temple. But
differences between the building's managers and the production company
that staged the room's inaugural musical, "A Big Band Christmas," led to
a change.</TE>
<TE>   Limon/Carr Productions of Tustin, which stages full-scale musicals
around Southern California, was unhappy with the marketing and
advertising support for "A Big Band Christmas." It offered the center a
chance to opt out of the contracted "Pirates of Penzance." Now Tibbie's
All American Cabaret, which has produced dinner theater since 1982 in
Orange County and Long Beach, has moved in. The first show, running
through April 28, is "Blue Eyes and His Buddies," a revue celebrating
Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals. Three more revues, "Those Fabulous
Forties II," "Viva Las Vegas" and "Holiday Follies" are scheduled through
the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kordas, general manager of the Event Center, praised the quality
of "A Big Band Christmas" but says the deal with Tibbie's is a better
business marriage. The center's focus is not promoting shows, but hosting
and catering business meetings, civic functions and private parties.
Kordas said Tibbie's is renting the theater and paying the center to
provide food and beverage service while it handles marketing, advertising
and ticket sales. The productions are revue-style shows rather than book
musicals, with actors doubling as waiters and interacting with the
audience. Kordas said Tibbie's, with its established clientele, has drawn
120 to 140 people per performance during the first two weeks of "Blue
Eyes," about double the average draw for "A Big Band Christmas."</TE>
