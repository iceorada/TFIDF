<HD>The Hum of Life Where Riots Once Raged</HD>

<LD>What I remember most are the children. There were three of them
huddled together on the porch of a house off Normandie Avenue. The
night was bright with fire, and as I drove by I could glimpse their
faces. Ten years later, I can still see them.</LD>
<LD>   It was April 29, 1992. L.A. was in pain. Riots were tearing apart
the South-Central section of the city. Flames licked at the dark sky
and sirens screamed into the night. There was gunfire. There was
death.</LD>
<LD>   And the children were watching.</LD>
<TE>   It all came back to me Monday in shades of fiery red as I drove
the same streets that were burned and smashed a decade ago. It was a
symbolic moment. Television vans that had gathered for the quick and
proper visit of President Bush were just leaving. The story was over.
Another anniversary had passed. Another politician had swung by.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from the massive coverage, both print and electronic,
we've pretty much gotten over trying to guess who was to blame for
the four days of calamity that cost 54 lives and nearly $1 billion in
damage.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't just the Rodney King jury or the mayor or the Los
Angeles Police Department or unemployment or racism or a genetic
memory of slavery itself that had caused L.A. to burn. It was all of
those things, and they're too hard to summarize, too intricate to
define in a single story or a single segment.</TE>
<TE>   I once asked a teenage boy who was dying of a rare form of cancer
how he felt. It was a stupid question, the kind that mindless TV
reporters ask when they shove a microphone into a widow's face. But I
won't forget the boy's answer. He said, "How do you describe the
color red to a blind man?"</TE>
<TE>   It's that way when a people, angry and frustrated, enduring pain
that is indescribable, explode. How do you define that kind of
motivation to someone who has never been hurt?</TE>
<TE>   I went back to South-Central on Monday to try to find the home of
the children I had seen that incendiary night. I've thought of them
often and I've looked for them before, without success. I didn't
succeed this time either.</TE>
<TE>   They'd probably be teenagers by now. I wondered how the terror of
that night had affected them. Deep fear experienced in childhood
rarely makes anyone a better adult. But sometimes it does engender a
determination to see that it doesn't happen to anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   I drove off the freeway at Normandie, the way I had back then, and
headed south. I wandered the areas around Halldale and Raymond
avenues, searching the numbered streets for anything that would
suddenly illuminate a memory.</TE>
<TE>   Once or twice I stopped to take a closer look. A place on West
57th Street seemed vaguely familiar, but so did a home on Denker
Avenue and another on Harvard Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   It was a frustrating experience in some ways, but not in others.
The homes in the neighborhoods once torn by riots seemed freshly
painted, as though to flaunt their renewal in the face of
anniversary. There were fluorescent greens and blues, and yellows so
bright that you had to shade your eyes to look at them.</TE>
<TE>   Not all the houses were that way. Some still bore the tired and
weathered look of the poor, or of people who just didn't care. But
not every home in any community shines with the determined newness I
saw often throughout South-Central. Even one mowed lawn or one
carefully tended garden glows with redemption in a dark memory.</TE>
<TE>   South-Central was at peace the day I drove and walked through. It
was a day of ordinary people doing ordinary things, and I mean that
in the best possible way. Women pushed their infants in strollers.
Young boys worked on a car in their driveway. Shoppers went in and
out of Ralphs. A man tended his garden.</TE>
<TE>   And children played.</TE>
<TE>   I had pretty much given up ever finding the kids on the porch by
the time I reached the Raymond Avenue School. I had turned down 76th
Street and was just kind of wandering and looking when I spotted
children in a schoolyard.</TE>
<TE>   They were playing kickball. I stopped to watch, fascinated by what
seemed the intricacies of the game. They were maybe third- or
fourth-graders, with the two teams mixed in just about every way and
not divided in any way.</TE>
<TE>   There were girls, boys, blacks, whites, Asians and Latinos on each
team. They cheered for one another, and it didn't make a bit of
difference what gender, what color or what ethnic origin they were.
They hadn't even been born when their neighborhoods were burning.</TE>
<TE>   I watched for a long time, until a woman who must have been a
teacher or a playground monitor began staring at me suspiciously. So
I drove back up the quiet side streets, thinking how good it was to
exist on an ordinary day. How much I liked to see nothing happening.
How sweet it was to see kids playing.</TE>
<TE>   I hadn't intended to write anything about that quiet afternoon.
Enough has been said already, and I didn't even find the house I was
looking for. But I did find something else. I found a community
shopping and working on cars and tending its gardens and cheering
each other. I found children laughing. And I just had to tell you
that.</TE>

<LD>Cosmopolitan magazine's editor in chief, Kate White, happily reports
that reading her new novel, "If Looks Could Kill," is like devouring
a box of chocolates. "It won't cleanse your soul," said White of the
book, which was the first pick of "Regis and Kelly" co-host Kelly
Ripa for the TV show's book club. "It has no intrinsic value. It's
not good for you."</LD>
<LD>   (Ripa told USA Today this week that she had picked the book for
its cover and its beach-reading quality because "there is too much
reality in the world today.")</LD>
<LD>   The book, a murder mystery set in the world of magazine
publishing, may sugar-coat the brain, but then White never set out to
write a "literary novel," she said. The empty calories are flying off
the shelves. After Ripa's book club pick, the novel sold out
overnight in stores nationwide.</LD>
<TE>   "They had to medevac in new supplies," said White, author of two
self-help books, "Why Good Girls Don't Get Ahead ... but Gutsy Girls
Do" and "9 Secrets of Women Who Get Everything They Want," and
editorial muse of the premiere magazine of chocolate, beach reading
and self-help.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which has its share of Cosmo-esque fantasy elements,
begins with this description of Cat Jones, the editor in chief of a
women's magazine: She "was the kind of woman who not only got
everything in the world that she wanted--in her case a fabulous job
... a gorgeous town house in Manhattan, and a hot-looking husband
with a big career of his own--but over the years also managed to get
plenty of what other women wanted: like their fabulous jobs and their
hot-looking husbands. It was hard not to hate her."</TE>
<TE>   White is not Jones, she said by phone from her New York home,
adding that she didn't model her characters on friends or colleagues.
Still, some are playing the literary guessing game: Who is the
fashion editor? Who are the writers? White said she only stole lines,
not characters.</TE>
<TE>   "I overheard someone say, 'I wish I had a stalker. If you have a
stalker, that means you're cute.' I co-opted that," White said. And
some incidents at Cosmopolitan would make it into the book, such as
the celebrity whom White would not name, who refused to pose wearing
silk. "'Jeez,' I said, 'why not?' Well, she objected to the cruelty
to silkworms," White said. "I must admit, I had never thought of
their suffering in any big way."</TE>
<TE>   At work, White would keep a diary on her computer, taking note of
other tidbits, like the photo editor who rented a herd of buffaloes
for a fashion shoot. (They posed in the background.)</TE>
<TE>   Although such note-taking was done at work, the writing was done
at home, while her teenage children slept. "I don't do sports, I have
no Martha Stewart abilities, I don't do needlepoint," White said.
"This is my hobby."</TE>
<TE>   A Thoroughly Hopeful 'Millie' on Broadway</TE>
<TE>   It's a gray day in Manhattan, but director Michael Mayer, whose
musical comedy "Thoroughly Modern Millie" opened on Broadway two
weeks ago, is barely aware of the weather. The Tony Awards
nominations are days away and Mayer is fully engaged in building
buzz. "Really every week now I've got benefits luncheons, awards
ceremonies," he said Monday by phone from his Manhattan apartment.
"It's crazy and really fun. It's the game part of it."</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the show earned 12 nominations from the Drama Desk, a
group of theater critics, editors and reporters. Among the nominees
were Mayer, star Sutton Foster and performer Marc Kudisch, composer
Jeanine Tesori, lyricist Dick Scanlan, librettists Scanlan and
Richard Morris, and choreographer Rob Ashford.</TE>
<TE>   Mayer's production, which is based on the 1967 film of the same
name, is set during the Jazz Age and tracks the adventures of flapper
Millie Dillmount. "Millie" enjoyed a sold-out run and rave reviews
last winter at the La Jolla Playhouse, but, the director and his
theatrical team were left wanting more. "All the parts were there,"
he said. "But the heart wasn't."</TE>
<TE>   So during the months between shows, they revamped the production,
adding a more lavish set and several new songs and scenes that
further develop the show's nine principal characters. "It's special
in the same way that 'Funny Girl' was so much about Fanny Brice, or
'Evita' ... because of its central character, who you get to know
inside and out," Mayer said. "We've taken a fun idea in a
less-than-perfect movie and improved on it significantly."</TE>
<TE>   Now the question is whether the Tony Award judges (their peers in
the business) agree.</TE>
<TE>   Stallone Hams It Up for Italian Company</TE>
<TE>   There's a new face in Italian meat products this spring: Sylvester
Stallone.</TE>
<TE>   The actor last week earned some extra cash posing as a James
Bond-type character in a TV commercial for Citterio, an Italian
company. During a one-day shoot aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach,
Stallone donned scuba gear in one scene and rappelled off the side of
the ship in another. His mission in the spot is to stop a couple of
jewel thieves from escaping with their loot. Stallone succeeds, but
when he reveals his name as "Bubi," his mystique dissolves and he
becomes the butt of a joke. "This company is saying, not only do you
have to have a good product, but you have to have a reputable name,"
said Matthew Feitshans of commercial production company Movie Magic
L.A. The spot airs for one year in Italy starting May 21.</TE>

<HD>Where Eclectic Collectors Hunt for Treasures</HD>
<DH>At the Los Angeles Antiques Show, the well-heeled find
surprising pieces to add to their classy hodgepodges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE STEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Interior designer Dale Engelson never expected her clients would
swoon over a pair of copper urns at the Los Angeles Antiques Show;
after all, they were on the hunt for an English low chest. Another
client searching for a side table to match a chair ended up with a
gilt framed wall mirror. And a couple who unexpectedly fell head over
heels for a Tang Dynasty horse a few years ago are still reveling in
their find.</LD>
<LD>   Such serendipitous discoveries seem to define the annual L.A.
Antiques Show, which opens to the public Friday at Santa Monica
Airport's Barker Hangar. Now in its seventh year, this is the
ultimate flea market for shoppers with deep pockets, sophisticated
tastes and, perhaps, a decorator in tow. A John Singer Sargent
painting will be there, alongside an Art Deco cocktail shaker, early
American mourning jewelry and an antique American weathervane, to
name just a few items. This eclectic mix reflects this city's A to Z
tastes and sets the show apart from other antique markets around the
country, where regional aesthetics, sensibilities and lifestyles
often dictate more homogenized slates of merchandise, leaving little
room for the unexpected discovery.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of shows in other major cities have a great deal of pricey
antiques and sort of stuffy antiques, and that doesn't work here,"
says Engelson, owner of the L.A. decorating firm DesignWorks. "It's
not that they're not beautiful, but they're very precious, and they
don't really fit our lifestyle. There are some wonderful antiques at
this show, but there are also a lot of fun pieces, too, like
Americana or country antiques. You feel you can put them just about
anywhere. Our clients are really comfortable with that. I don't think
anyone in L.A. wants a room that looks like an interior designer put
their stamp on it."</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles likes dramatic furniture," says interior designer
Thomas Beeton of Thomas Beeton and Associates in West Hollywood. It's
the same boldness that attracts mavericks to the city. "The show has
a lot of unusual objects, pieces that have an unusual quirk. They're
pieces of sculpture that happen to be furniture. People are drawn to
objects that have power." Standouts from past shows, he recalls,
include an 18th century Spanish Colonial table found in Peru that
Beeton describes as "an exuberant combination of gilt and color and
scale. It was the most unique painted piece of South American
furniture I had ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   Beeton says his clients are "generally" looking for Italian,
French and Irish furniture from the 17th century to the beginning of
the 19th century, in addition to Swedish and Baltic pieces. "They all
like scale, and gutsy pieces," he explains. "But my clients don't
want things to look as if they take themselves too seriously. Last
year a client bought a beautiful pair of bronze Modernist tables from
the 1960s and set them next to a 1910 China trade settee. The show is
about this idea of assembling an interior. I love the Winter Antiques
show in New York, but it really is a museum with price tags. There
are plenty of people here who can afford those pieces, but the
presentation here is more off the cuff, yet elegantly done."</TE>
<TE>   About 66 dealers are expected this year, and everything has been
authenticated by a panel of experts. The show officially kicks off
tonight with a $250-a-person gala preview party benefiting the
Women's Guild of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which co-sponsors the
show with the Antiques Dealers Assn. of California, or ADAC, and ends
Sunday. Events also include a lecture series, and on Wednesday there
was a preview for interior designers.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Antiques Show isn't L.A.'s first major charity-aligned
show of its kind. The Los Angeles Junior League hosted an annual
antiques show from 1979 to 1988. But a sagging economy, as well as
location problems, ended it. Nothing comparable took its place until
1996, when California antique dealers felt "it was time we got
involved with something bigger than an annual dinner," says show
co-founder Daniel Stein of Daniel Stein Antiques Inc. in San
Francisco. (San Francisco has its own Fall Antiques show, but ADAC
only organizes the authentication of objects for the show.)</TE>
<TE>   Fans of the event, who include serious collectors and buyers,
just-lookings and baseball-capped celebrities, say the ability to
find a variety of things in a day's stroll is what draws them. "I
have clients who have incredible modern art collections, but they
couple it with very classic, clean-lined 18th century furniture,"
says Sally Gould Wright, co-owner of Richard Gould Antiques in L.A.,
a second-generation dealer of 18th and 19th century English and
American decorative arts, and president of ADAC. "I think in the
'90s, and into the 21st century, eclecticism is much further ranging
than it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   L.A's reputation as a trend-conscious city is reflected not only
in its taste for clothes, cars and cappuccinos, but in antiques as
well. In 1996, the rage was for Art Deco portraits by Tamara De
Lempicka, collected by Jack Nicholson and Madonna. "There are styles
in collecting, just as there are fads in fashion," says Wright, who
adds that she's seen more interest in recent years in Deco, from
furniture to jewelry, as well as folk art.</TE>
<TE>   "Collecting comes in waves," Wright says, "and what's popular at
the moment can be influenced by what the magazines are showing, what
people think is going to go up in the market. The popularity of Art
Deco may have something to do with the tie to Hollywood and the
movies, Jean Harlow and all those people. We also have wonderful Art
Deco architecture here."</TE>
<TE>   Beeton has seen a spike in popularity--and prices--in recent years
for French Modernism, pieces from the 1930s and '40s that are "sexy,
chic and stylish." Clients are also decorating outdoor spaces with
the same fervor as indoors. Beeton recalls one couple who scooped up
a pair of garden ornaments for $3,500.</TE>
<TE>   Interior designers who shop the show carefully consider which
clients they'll shepherd--it usually ends up being people they've
worked with previously who don't go into sticker shock when they see
a six-figure price tag.</TE>
<TE>   "People are willing to pay for quality and authenticity," says
Engelson, who adds that a few clients haven't blinked at dropping
five figures for a piece, although the average sale hovers around
four. "They're not really balking at the price if they find what they
want, so that's not really a struggle." Beeton, too, takes clients
whom he's educated to the ways of high-end spending, and spend they
have, as much as $50,000 or $60,000 on individual pieces, including
an American Gothic Revival desk.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he spends hours at the designer preview night picking
out pieces for clients, Beeton encourages them to be open to those
corner-of-the-eye finds, like the bolt of Lyonnaise fabric circa 1785
he found on the way out the door on closing night one year. He's not
the only one who takes this approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I try not to have a preset feeling of what I should find," says
collector Stella Krieger who, with husband Fred, collects antique
rugs and textiles, among other things. "If you do, you're in for a
disappointment. We know people who have collected similar things and
are attracted to something different. I think that depends a lot on
the dealers--if they're particularly good salesmen they can get you
interested, especially if you're waiting to be inspired."</TE>
<TE>   Educating Angelenos</TE>
<TE>   on the Finer Things</TE>
<TE>   Some outsiders view Los Angeles as a design-savvy hub, but others
hang on to the tired perception of the city as unsophisticated,
uneducated and uninterested in antiques--a town filled with sun-fried
show-biz wannabes concerned only with the new. "Los Angeles doesn't
lack for intelligence and the ability to appreciate art," says John
Keith Russell, owner of John Keith Russell Antiques in South Salem,
N.Y., "but it can't appreciate something it's not exposed to." That
makes for little interest here in the pre-1850 American antiques in
which he specializes.</TE>
<TE>   But ask Connecticut-based American antiquities dealer Allan Katz
how business has been the last five years he's had a booth at the
L.A. Antiques Show and he is very upbeat. "People in Los Angeles love
art and they're attracted to things that have good art content," says
Katz, owner of Allan Katz Americana in Woodbridge, Conn., who
typically brings sculptural folk art that's "visually very strong,"
and this year plans to include weathervanes, an 1820 painted clock
and a painted carousel horse from 1910. "I think the museums and
designers and magazines have all nurtured their eye in a positive
way."</TE>
<TE>   Art dealer James Berry Hill of Berry-Hill Galleries in New York
says his strategy is to bring "phenomenal things," which this year
translates into a Singer Sargent and an Edward Hopper.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very sophisticated buyers in a wide, diverse audience,"
he says. "Last year we brought the highest quality--including a major
Folies Bergere collection--and Los Angeles responded with an
enthusiasm that was very gratifying. I think the L.A. market is
starved for really fine things. There's clearly a tradition in L.A.
of fine collections."</TE>
<TE>   "I like the L.A. show," says ethnic and tribal art dealer Joel
Cooner of Dallas, who's bringing a pair of 16th century Japanese
temple dogs (price tag: $30,000) to the show. "It draws a great
crowd, the best crowd I've ever seen in California, and I do have
some collectors out there. But L.A. is just a weird place. It's full
of weirdos. But I'm comfortable there--I'm a weirdo.</TE>
<TE>   "I have serious material, and in New York, people know what
they're looking at," Cooner adds. "In New York people get to see a
lot of art; there are always shows in New York, millions of
exhibitions at museums. The education quotient is incredible. In
L.A., they don't have a clue. But if they like it, they buy it.
Somebody might come there to buy a diamond ring, and then they'll see
a Zulu hat and have to have it."</TE>
<TE>   Even some locals share Cooner's view: "We're not that
sophisticated," says Elizabeth Dinkel, a partner with the West
Hollywood design firm Leta Austin Foster &amp; Associates and a Women's
Guild member. "I don't know whether it's because L.A. is somewhat
transitional, but I'm concerned that there's so much new money here
that there's not that much appreciation for old things. Look at all
the wonderful old houses in Beverly Hills that have been flattened. I
always try to encourage clients to buy antiques because they
appreciate in value and are a piece of history and a thing of beauty.
I think there's a lack of education and appreciation, and that's why
the show is so important."</TE>

<LD>BILLIE'S KISS</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Elizabeth Knox</LD>
<TE>   Ballantine</TE>
<TE>   336 pages; $24</TE>
<TE>   When the Gustav Edda explodes moments after it pulls into port on
a remote Scottish island, Billie Paxton loses her last remaining
blood relative, her beloved sister Edith.</TE>
<TE>   Bright, but illiterate, Billie must face the world on her own,
beginning with the demanding task of helping her brother-in-law cope
with the loss of his wife, who was about to deliver their first
child.</TE>
<TE>   And so begins Elizabeth Knox's broodingly atmospheric romance,
"Billie's Kiss," set in 1903, mostly on the divided Scottish island
of Kissack and Skilling. Knox ushers in the 20th century with a
literal and figurative boom, as the novel introduces many of the
explosive controversies that would come to characterize the century.
Eugenics and the advance of technology with its monstrous
possibilities figure prominently in "Billie's Kiss," yet the tale
never buckles under the weight of its ideas.</TE>
<TE>   Knox's descriptions bring the story into vivid display, beginning
with the Gustav Edda's explosion as witnessed by Billie, seconds
after she had left the ship:</TE>
<TE>   "Through the steam Billie glimpsed an impossibility--the ship
drifting backwards from the wharf propelled by the water boiling in
its stack. She saw a mooring line snap at the pier and recoil to
flick a figure off the perpendicular starboard deck. The port deck
was underwater, the ship rolling over at its berth, water boiling
around it and flooded with jets of fire. There were people in the
sea. And there were people hoisting themselves over the starboard
rail and onto the gleaming side of the ship."</TE>
<TE>   Murdo Hesketh, one of the few survivors with Billie and her
brother-in-law Henry, had observed Billie fleeing the ship and was
convinced the young woman was somehow involved in its explosion. A
fiery and fiercely determined man, Hesketh begins his own
investigation once the trio reaches their final destination, the
island's Kiss Castle, the residence of Hesketh's cousin, Lord Hallow-
hulme.</TE>
<TE>   Hesketh presses on with the investigation, alienating Billie. The
notion that she could have forced her own sister's death seems sheer
madness to Billie.</TE>
<TE>   Knox does an especially fine job of depicting the tension between
Billie and Hesketh, building a push-and-pull magnetism in convincing
detail. Despite her inability to read (Billie suffers from dyslexia,
a recognized though unnamed disorder at the time), the young woman
stands up for herself with spirited force. Billie reveals herself as
a complex character, insecure and proud, fragile and possessed of
deep reserves of strength.</TE>
<TE>   Knox's depiction of her wild intuitiveness calls to mind the
character of Catherine in Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights," and
Hesketh resembles something of a mature and bolder version of
Heathcliff. Their relationship sets off an intensifying flurry of
sparks.</TE>
<TE>   While suspicion and fury dominate their initial rapport, the
prickles ultimately soften. When Hesketh finds his life endangered on
the brambly heath of the island, Billie arrives and helps the man she
has considered her enemy. The mutual hostility between the characters
fades as, bit by bit, they reveal their sorrows and passions to one
another:</TE>
<TE>   "His pity was like a light passing through her, their atoms
intermingled.</TE>
<TE>   "He had all these griefs, it turned out; he wasn't only strong and
striking but a man of substance, solid with suffering ... Murdo
Hesketh was as sad as she was. Since Edith's death Billie had been
shown goodwill and sympathy, but this was a sadness that sang along
to hers, another soul with perfect pitch." Knox's narrative style
draws much from the 19th century romance, with its lush writing and
darkly wild settings. Yet Knox brings her own slant to the genre,
allowing some of her characters to find solid placement in their
frighteningly changing world. But romance isn't Knox's only concern.</TE>
<TE>   When the novel resolves the mystery of the Gustav Edda's
explosion, readers are bound to feel the effects of its prophetic
chill, as we are shown technology's horrors close-up. Knox show us
the budding inventions that would soon be used in the modern world to
achieve mass destruction, like the "earthmoving machines" that "paved
the way for tanks," which would eventually leave "men trapped and
crushed in their trenches." Perhaps even more chilling are the
devices that would permit men to cause destruction at a chosen future
time and from great distance.</TE>
<TE>   Physical and emotional removal, a loss of intimacy's mercies,
these are the most profoundly tragic losses that have engaged Knox's
imagination in "Billie's Kiss." Her portrait of a world bound for
modernity, and utterly heedless of the implications of its plunge
seems all too convincing.</TE>

<LD>Spring is still going strong, but now it's time to think about
summer. May is the month to plant the annual flowers and vegetables
that make summer so splendid, including those American favorites, the
marigold and tomato. Big planting projects should be finished fast.
Otherwise, the plants will need almost constant watering.</LD>
<LD>   Look for annual bedding plants that like the summer sun and bloom
straight through, including ageratum, alyssum, balsam, celosia,
bedding dahlia, annual petunia, summer phlox, portulaca, bedding
salvia, verbena and zinnia. In the shade, try bedding begonia,
caladium, coleus, forget-me-not, mimulus and impatiens.</LD>

<LD>Pot a Plant!</LD>
<LD>   Do you want a good reason to play in the dirt? If so, potting a
plant is the perfect answer. And, even more fun than getting your
hands dirty, you will witness the magic of a tiny seed growing into a
plant right before your eyes. If you think about it, the whole Earth
is really a garden. Plants grow all over the world. They grow where
it is hot or cold, wet or dry. They can grow indoors as well as
outside.</LD>
<LD>   Plants have many friends that help them grow: dirt, sunlight,
water and air. Dirt, or soil, helps plant roots to get water, air and
nutrients to sustain themselves. Sunlight gives them energy to grow.
Some plants like bright sun while others like shady areas. Without
water, plants would die. Seeds need water to get started and then
more water to grow. However, if plants get too much water, they will
drown! And all plants need air to breathe, just like people. Plants
breathe through their leaves, stems and roots.</LD>
<TE>   Now that you know what plants need to grow, you are ready to get
your hands dirty. So let's pot a plant!</TE>
<TE>   * Find a container for your plant. You can plant seeds in almost
any kind of container, like paper cups, milk or yogurt cartons, or
flowerpots. Make sure there are small drainage holes in the bottom of
the container you select.</TE>
<TE>   * Fill the container almost to the top with potting soil.</TE>
<TE>   * Select the seeds you want to grow. Plant each seed about three
times as deep as the seed is fat.</TE>
<TE>   * Cover the seeds loosely with one-eighth inch of soil. If you are
planting several seeds, make sure they at least 2 inches apart.</TE>
<TE>   * Water carefully and place the container in a sunny spot.</TE>
<TE>   Check your pot every day by sticking your finger in the soil. If
it feels dry, water lightly. In a few weeks you should see the start
of your plant.</TE>
<TE>   Learn more about potting plants at the Arboretum's Festival of
Plants this weekend. There will be a "pot a plant" kid's program on
Sunday from 11 a.m. until 2p.m. For more information, visit
arboretum.org, or call (626) 821-3222.</TE>

<LD>It's an impassive presence that seems to transcend the ebb and flow
of Tinseltown glamour--a somber Neoclassical temple that stands in
stark contrast to the evolving parade of movers, shakers, panhandlers
and paparazzi that have passed before it. Built in 1921 as the
headquarters of the Hollywood Freemasons, the property has just been
restored and rededicated as the El Capitan Entertainment Centre by
Disney's Buena Vista Theatres, Inc., but this is only the latest
incarnation of a building said to have once had a tunnel to Grauman's
Chinese Theater right across Hollywood Boulevard. These days it is
best known for playing host to after-the-film playhouses for Disney's
kiddie films.</LD>
<LD>   Just a couple doors east of the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, site of
the first Academy Awards, the former Masonic temple sits squarely
across from the entrance to the Kodak Theatre, the award ceremony's
new home. And when viewed through that archway, it aligns like a
picture that's been waiting for a concrete frame.</LD>
<TE>   With the limelight back on this block, "the time was right to
bring this building back to its original beauty," says Ed Collins,
director of operations for Buena Vista Theatres. "The funny thing is,
this building received its historic culture landmark designation in
1984, and it took us about 20 years to finally get a plaque on it,"
he says, pointing to the bronze tablet installed at an April 9
ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Renovations included cleaning and relighting the facade, new
plumbing and interior lighting and enhancing the air-conditioning.
Guided by historical records provided by the members of the
Hollywood-West Valley Lodge No. 355, which now meets in Tarzana,
crews restored original fixtures, including backlighted stone
filigree, wrought iron torchieres, Batchelder tiles and old post
boxes once used by Masonic officers. Gazing up at refinished woodwork
carved with unfamiliar symbols, Collins, whose father was a Mason,
admits, "I never knew what they did except that they wore costumes
and did a lot of things on Fridays and Saturdays."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood-West Valley Lodge member Jerry Shubb, a former master of
his lodge and secretary for the past 10 years, is not surprised by
the confusion. "There are people running around who even think we're
devil worshippers," he chuckles, "or at least some kind of dark,
secret society. The truth is, we're not a secret society--just a
society with some secrets."</TE>
<TE>   Masonic ritual and regalia nonetheless can be quite mystifying to
the outsider. A Mason attends meetings wearing a sort of abbreviated
bricklayer's apron, and officers may wear medallions, carry staffs or
don a top hat according to their rank. Members of other Masonic
bodies, such as the Shrine, wear jeweled fezzes, and the Masonic
Knights Templar don Napoleonic hats with flamboyant plumes. Prominent
in fraternal symbology is the builder's trowel--a reminder to "spread
the cement of brotherly love and affection"--and the architect's
compass, to "circumscribe our desires." Shubb says the order's
purpose can be neatly summed up in one simple phrase: "To make good
men better."</TE>
<TE>   The history of the Hollywood Lodge is inextricably linked to the
landmarks that surround it. From 1903 to 1921 the members met in a
structure in the approximate location of today's Kodak Theatre. The
first master, Gilbert F. Stevenson, lived nearby on a five-acre lemon
ranch, which he later sold to a lodge brother who built the Egyptian
Theatre on the spot. That buyer was Charles E. Toberman, the
whirlwind developer often referred to as the "father of Hollywood."
Master of the Hollywood Lodge in 1914, Toberman was not only
responsible for enticing Sid Grauman into Hollywood to create the
Egyptian, Chinese and El Capitan theaters, but also for construction
of the Hollywood Roosevelt, Hollywood Bowl, Pantages Theatre and the
Max Factor Building. Before any of these developments stood along the
boulevard, however, Toberman built the new lodge headquarters there,
in 1922. At the time, the temple was one of the most substantial
structures in Hollywood's sparse mix of buildings and citrus groves.</TE>
<TE>   The architect appointed to the project was John C. Austin, who
later worked on the Shrine Auditorium--also a Masonic
headquarters--Griffith Observatory and City Hall. The new facility
included a billiard room, pipe organ, ladies parlor, ballroom and
lodge rooms, and was described in a contemporary account as
"unsurpassed for beauty, attractiveness and richness of equipment."
Rooms were appointed with custom oak furniture upholstered in Spanish
leather and were adorned with symbols of the order. In those early
days when Hollywood was an independent city, the city attorney, city
marshal, city treasurer and first mayor, George Dunlop, all were
Masons. Arthur Letts, founder of the Broadway department store and
artist Paul de Longpre, whose gallery and gardens drew many to the
community, both were members, along with prominent judges and a
significant number of bankers. The city's first newspaper and
doctor's office were established by members, and the city's electric
car service was owned and operated by brothers of the lodge.</TE>
<TE>   Many Freemasons were also notables in the fledgling film industry,
among them Oliver Hardy, Harold Lloyd, Douglas Fairbanks Sr., W.C.
Fields, Cecil B. DeMille and D.W. Griffith. In the freewheeling days
before film permits, the Hollywood Boulevard temple was even
commandeered for some guerrilla location work. Lodge minutes record
that "Bro. Toberman reported that he found a door in the roof of the
Masonic temple open, also a broken window in the skylight, which had
caused some damage in the walls by letting in the rain. Shortly
after, while attending a picture show, he saw a picture of the roof
of the Temple on the screen with a crowd of men climbing out of the
roof through the door mentioned and a shaking of the skylight by
them, they being employees of the Universal Film Company."</TE>
<TE>   When the Great Depression threatened the lodge, it turned briefly
to renting out the ground floor to a social club, which embarrassed
the Masonic landlords by installing an illegal slot machine. Though
membership took a dip around 1932, World War II saw an increase that
Shubb attributes to the desire of enlisted men to join a
international network that could support them on their tour of duty.
Masonry's patriotic ideals were also well tuned to the times, and
local Freemasons like John Wayne, Glenn Ford, Roy Rogers and Gene
Autry embodied those values onscreen.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnam War era, however, was not so kind. As new generations
turned their backs and older members expired, a dip in membership was
observed nationwide. By the late '70s, the Hollywood Lodge was again
renting out ground-floor space to a restaurant, and in 1980 moved out
altogether. Relocating to Van Nuys (and later Tarzana), it became
Hollywood-West Valley Lodge. When expensive fire and seismic upgrades
forced members to put the Hollywood building up for sale in 1982,
singer Rosita LaBello briefly converted their old stomping grounds
into the Hollywood Opera &amp; Theater Company. When that venture ran
into the red, the property was sold back to the lodge. In 1987
another buyer turned the space into a short-lived nightclub. By 1989,
Buena Vista and Pacific Theaters were spearheading neighborhood
redevelopment with the restoration of the El Capitan Theatre next
door. With the completion of that project, Collins says, Buena Vista
began leasing the old Masonic temple for special events, opening the
space to the general public as a "toy box" for the 1995 premiere of
"Toy Story." The combination of live shows, videos, games and
costumed characters was successful, and in 1998, Disney purchased the
building and began regularly creating themed environments in
conjunction with screenings. Buena Vista also rents out the space to
others for industry parties, premieres, record releases and product
roll-outs.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Disney's refurbishing revealed no evidence of the secret
tunnel, which lodge members allege was used as an escape route for
movie stars eager to evade mobs at premieres. Collins notes that Red
Line construction would have obliterated any such passageway should
it have existed, but Shubb is not so skeptical. "I have not been able
to personally confirm it, but I was in the building with a member who
was involved with maintenance, and he showed me the exact spot where
he remembered it being." With the recent death of Shubb's guide,
however, the existence of the tunnel will likely remain as obscure as
those handshakes, oaths and initiatory ordeals that remain the
society's secrets.</TE>

<DH>A book by a Tiffany designer examines the world of the
precious metal and those who played a role in its evolution.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For anyone who thinks American silver design is just a 1770s bowl by
Paul Revere, "Magnificent Tiffany Silver," the latest book by Tiffany
design director John Loring (Harry N. Abrams, 2001) is an eye-opener.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to show that the most interesting things being done in
silver in the 1870s and on were being done here, not in Europe. Many
people still tend to think that silver design began and ended with
George III silver in England," says Loring. "But there was a real
American style that looked West and used images from the American
Indian and Japan."</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, this book is solely about Tiffany, and one cannot
forget the author's investment in the products, but the stories
Loring tells nevertheless figure prominently in the history of the
medium.</LD>
<TE>   Among those responsible for breaking with Europe and creating an
American style is Tiffany designer Edward C. Moore (1827-91), who is
celebrated with more than 50 pages in this picture-filled 272-page
book.</TE>
<TE>   Moore won the bronze medal at the 1867 Paris Exposition, a
competitive decorative arts show, for his "Moresque" tea set, the
first award ever given American silver by a foreign jury. And this
was only two years after the Civil War ended. "These were really
modern times," says Loring. "Manet was painting impressionist
paintings, Japan had been open for 10 years and the influence of
Oriental art had completely changed the look of the world." And it
was the Americans who developed a more modern, abstracted look for
design.</TE>
<TE>   The 1867 exposition's theme was Orientalism, which reinforced
Moore's interest in both Islamic and Japanese images. And this
interest continued, so that in 1871 Moore designed "Japanese" silver
flatware (renamed "Audubon" during World War II), which remains
Tiffany's best-selling silver pattern today.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1878 Paris Exposition, Tiffany &amp; Co. with designs by Moore,
won the grand prize "for its entirely revolutionary introduction of
designs liberated from Western Europe's rigid and overused design
vocabularies and based on the superbly refined, organic and
naturalistic design aesthetic of Japan," writes Loring. In fact,
Loring calls Moore's Japanesque silverware America's greatest
achievement in silver. "It was looked on as being completely modern
and innovative and in step with the times. The Europeans were amazed
because it was the Americans who had done this, the ones who were
supposed to have no culture, no civilization, no ideas, no design,"
he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   There is a hammered-silver flask with a fish swimming through
reeds, a Japanesque vase with a copper body covered with pale gray
enamel and applied silver, copper and brass decoration, and silver
and copper coffee sets with dragonflies and wisterias, all motifs
that Louis Comfort Tiffany would use later in his Art Nouveau
designs.</TE>
<TE>   The 1889 Saracenic wares were the final flowering of Moore's
genius as a silversmith, writes Loring. In them he compiled all that
he loved in Islamic art.</TE>
<TE>   Chapters after the one devoted to Moore feature other Tiffany
silversmiths and their contributions to the evolution of silver
design. Loring writes, "Although not attaining the same level of
invention, vigor and originality in their designs and silver crafting
as Moore, John T. Curran and Paulding Farnham, along with Moore's
original collaborators James Whitehouse, Charles Grosjean, Eugene
Soligny and Charles Osborne, made undeniably major contributions to
the history of 19th century silver at Tiffany's and in America."</TE>
<TE>   Examples of various styles include American Victorianism, Art
Deco, Art Nouveau and contemporary. Under Victorianism, there is the
sculptural 1873 Comanche Trophy with an Indian hunter on his
galloping horse, and a wine jug in the form of a pig being annoyed by
a large dragonfly on its nose. Under the chapter titled "The
Flowering of an American Style," Farnham's bowl for the 1900 Paris
Exhibition is a take on a Hupa Indian basket in silver and copper
with American turquoise rattlesnake handles. Art Nouveau is
represented in Louis Comfort Tiffany's Byzantine-style three-handled
chalice with emeralds and turquoises.</TE>
<TE>   In contemporary times, Loring writes, Elsa Peretti helped bring
silver jewelry back into fashion. Her organically formed pitcher from
1984 demonstrates her admiration for Japanese craftsmanship as well
as her love of nature and organic forms.</TE>
<TE>   Although this is Loring's 11th book on the subject of Tiffany
design--two more are on the way--it is fresh in its depiction of an
American style in silversmithing that has flourished for so long.
Loring puts the design in a historical context so the reader
understands why and how it happened.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures of these works, most found today only in museums or
private collections, are astonishing. Where else could one find a
silver and copper buffalo loving cup with handles in the form of
bison horns resting on bison heads and hoofs?</TE>

<LD>   Is the Robert Blake Case</LD>
<LD>   Headed for the Screen?</LD>
<TE>   It didn't take long.</TE>
<TE>   SilverCreek Entertainment said Wednesday it has picked up the
movie and literary rights to the Robert Blake case, as told by
Christina Scheier, a longtime friend of the actor's slain wife,
Bonny Lee Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Scheier claims to have photos, letters and postcards providing
motives for the murder in Bakley's own words. No hit man was
involved, she says.</TE>
<TE>   The "Thelma &amp; Louise"-style story encompasses "newly discovered
information which may solve yet another crime of the century," said
Larry Garrison, president of SilverCreek. "We are confident that
Christina knows it all and has decided to avenge her best friend's
death."</TE>
<TE>   The working title of the book, to be written by Garrison, is "Best
Friends Never Die." The project will, most likely, end up on TV.</TE>

raise that may more than double his estimated $4-million annual
salary.</TE>
<TE>   NBC sources say the 44-year-old "Today" co-host, who had more than
a year remaining on his contract, signed shortly after fellow host
Katie Couric agreed in December to a whopping $65-million, five-year
deal.</TE>
<TE>   An NBC News spokeswoman declined to comment, but according to an
executive at the network, "Matt's future at 'Today' is extremely
secure."</TE>

<TE>   THEATER</TE>
<TE>   'Into the Woods' Lands Gently on Broadway</TE>
<TE>   Direct from the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles, the revival of
"Into the Woods" drew mostly favorable reviews on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   "By all means, go to 'Into the Woods,'" wrote Ben Brantley of the
New York Times--though he found James Lapine's book a bit repetitive.
Linda Winer of Newsday disagreed about the script, calling it "dark,
wise and adorable--even more lucid now."</TE>
<TE>   A rave by Clive Barnes in the New York Post said the piece "is as
bright, intriguing, funny, complex, puzzling, charming, slightly
preachy and musically elaborate as ever." But Howard Kissel of the
Daily News begged to differ. The show, he observed, is "coarse from
start to finish," with a cast that "is, for the most part,
charmless."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Isherwood of Variety found the revival "flashier and
blessedly brisker" than the original, though "it never quite ceases
to be a theatrical conceit." He praised Vanessa Williams' portrayal
of the witch, however.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   PBS has ordered nine more episodes of Gregory Nava's Latino drama
"American Family." ... Intermedia has acquired rights to remake
"Billy Jack," the 1971 film in which Tom Laughlin starred as a loner
taking on the establishment.... Oscar-winner Halle Berry will star in
and produce two MGM pictures: a remake of the 1974 blaxploitation
film "Foxy Brown" and the character study "Brown-Eyed Girl," Variety
reports.... DreamWorks, which was said to have won a bidding war for
the rights to the TV classic "Hawaii Five-O," is unwilling to meet
one of the terms of the producer and is now one of several companies
vying for the project.... Vin Diesel will not be appearing in
Universal's sequel to the street-racing hit "The Fast and the
Furious," Variety reports. Director Rob Cohen, whose participation
was contingent on the actor returning, will also be a no-show.</TE>

<LD>Kenny Chesney's "No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems" entered the
national album charts at No. 1 Wednesday, ending Ashanti's three-week
reign at the top.</LD>
<LD>   The 32-year-old Tennessee native doesn't have a high profile among
pop fans, but he's been a star in country music since the mid-'90s,
thanks to the traditional country feel of such hits as "I Lost It"
and "She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy." "No Shoes" sold 235,000 copies
last week, easily topping Ashanti's total of 143,000.</LD>
<LD>   Three other new releases entered the national Top 20: the
soundtrack for "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" at No. 6,
rapper Cee-Lo's "Cee-Lo Green &amp; His Perfect Imperfections" at No. 11,
Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" at No. 13 and Elvis Costello's "When I
Was Cruel" at No. 20. Joining Chesney, Ashanti and "Star Wars" in the
Top 10 are, in order: Celine Dion, Sheryl Crow, the ninth volume of
the "Now That's What I Call Music" compilation, "The Scorpion King"
soundtrack, the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" soundtrack, Josh Groban
and Pink.</LD>
<TE>   The best-selling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on
"Girlfriend."</TE>

<HD>Steve Earle Hooks Into the Beat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The road makes sense to Steve Earle. He's spent time there as a
traveling musician, and he has been drawn to the romance of escape
since his first comical attempts at riding the rails of Texas at age
13. "I don't believe in cruise control," the singer-songwriter
declared Tuesday at the Knitting Factory, reading from a poem that
name-dropped Jack Kerouac and celebrated old-school driving skills.</LD>
<LD>   Earle was there to headline the fourth day of the club's Beat
Fest, an appreciation of the lasting cultural impact of the writers
and artists of the Beat Generation. The night also included veteran
rock rebel Simon Stokes, who painted vivid, demented imagery with the
help of a six-man band led by guitarist Wayne Kramer. And Wanda
Coleman offered intense readings of several poems dedicated to "all
those who still have the spirit of the rebel angels."</LD>
<LD>   Stokes and Coleman have an obvious connection with the Beat
legacy. But it was Earle who underlined the impact of that history
with unlikely force. For more than two hours he stood alone on stage,
mingling his best songs with tales of personal misadventure before
joyfully reading an excerpt from Kerouac's "On the Road" during his
encore.</LD>
<TE>   He began the show by joking, "I used to be a folk singer; now I'm
a recovering folk singer." But despite time served in the Nashville
establishment, Earle has always been a folk singer. Which made
Tuesday's performance a lot more Woody than Hank, opening with Bob
Dylan's 1962 take on Eric Von Schmidt's "Baby, Let Me Follow You
Down."</TE>
<TE>   In the same way that Dylan was inspired by the rootless
introspection of the Beats, Earle crafted songs of biting emotional
depth, blending humor and hurt, along with the occasional moment of
social commentary. Either strumming broad strokes or picking delicate
patterns on his acoustic guitar, Earle played material that spanned
his career, singing gravely of lost love and death row.</TE>
<TE>   He dived into the brutal work of Lightnin' Hopkins with an edgy
reading of "Limousine Blues." But whether he was assaying ancient
blues or his own recent work, Earle sang as the restless traveler,
often in a voice suggesting a man beaten down by broken dreams, but
still able to feel the pain.</TE>

<LD>2pm Pop Music</LD>
<LD>   Lila Downs' intoxicating tour of boleros, American pop standards,
tales of Mexico's indigenous people (in their own languages), Woody
Guthrie anthems and idiosyncratic originals reflects her bicultural
heritage (mom a Mixtec from Mexico, dad a Minnesota Anglo) and places
her at the forefront of the new guard of independent-minded Latina
singers. Downs marks Cinco de Mayo with three area performances.</LD>
<LD>   Lila Downs, Santa Monica College Amphitheatre, 1900 Pico Blvd.,
Santa Monica, 2 p.m. Free. (310) 434-3431. Sunday at Amoeba Music,

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   all dayTheater</TE>
<TE>   "Three Plays/Three Voices," a daylong theatrical reflection on the
causes and consequences of the L.A. riots of 1992, features the plays
"Corner Store Riot," M.J. Kang's drama about Korean shop owners in
South-Central L.A. on the eve of the upheaval; "Canned Goods," Silas
Jones' surrealistic vision of intercity lives; and "Olympic Notions &amp;
Supply," a look at post-riot L.A. through a guarded friendship
between two older African American and Korean people, by Robert
Barnett. The event will also include "Are We Getting Along Yet?," a
panel discussion with artists, activists, community leaders and the
audience.</TE>

<TE>   all day Festival</TE>
<TE>   Don't kid yourself. The 1500s were not this much fun. Plague,
intolerance, beheadings, bearbaiting, no MTV.... Nevertheless this
weekend, the original Renaissance Pleasure Faire celebrates its 40th
year with a re-creation of a 16th century English country fair and
marketplace with eight stages of continuous entertainment, food,
crafts, games and indoor restrooms with 21st century plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   Renaissance Pleasure Faire, Glen Helen Regional Park, 2555 Glen
Helen Parkway, San Bernardino. Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6
p.m. through June 16. Also open May 27. $7.50 to $17.50; children

<TE>   all day Tour</TE>
<TE>   The Venice Garden Tour offers a peek into some of the most
interesting private gardens in that beach community. This year for
the first time, the self-guided tour will also include a section of
the Venice canals area south of Venice Boulevard. Proceeds benefit
the Neighborhood Youth Assn. Visitors are advised to begin the
walking tour by 2 p.m. to see all the gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Venice Garden Tour starts at Jay Griffith Studio, 717 California
Ave., Venice, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. $50. (310) 390-6641.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Music</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the public discussion of World War II-era Japanese
relocation camps, the Los Angeles Chamber Singers have crafted a
program titled "Pearls on Sand: The Japanese-American Connection" for
the UCLA faculty composers series. Represented are Ian Krouse and
Paul Chihara of the faculty, the late Toru Takemitsu, UCLA alumna
Naomi Sekiya and the winner of a recent student competition, Kay
Rhie.</TE>

Schoenberg Hall, UCLA, Westwood, 8 p.m. $7 to $18. (310) 825-2101.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   All due respect to the Fab Four and "Beatlemania," but the real
Beatle is the one most suited to present that legacy. When Paul
McCartney opened his U.S. tour last month, he did the tradition
proud, especially in a risky and touching acoustic segment that
included salutes to John Lennon and George Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   Paul McCartney, Staples Center, 1111 S. Figueroa St., L.A., 8 p.m.
$51.75 to $258.75. (213) 742-7300. Also Sunday at the Arrowhead Pond,
2695 E. Katella Blvd., Anaheim, 8 p.m. $50 to $250. (714) 704-2500.</TE>

<TE>   7 &amp; 9:30pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   Stop the presses! Remake Page 1! Send out for bigger headline
type! Collage Dance Theatre, the locally based master of
site-specific performances, takes on American journalism in "Cover
Story." Staged in the Spanish Mission-style Herald Examiner Building
downtown, the production moves through a number of atmospheric
locations--the ornate lobby, the newsroom, the pressroom--all given a
hallucinatory spin through the use of video projections, a marching
band and a griot (African storyteller). In "After Eden," the
company's award-winning hotel extravaganza last year, a mermaid
materialized from the depths of the Marriott swimming pool, so who
knows what impossible fantasies the Her-Ex environment may inspire?</TE>
<TE>   "Cover Story," Collage Dance Theatre, Herald Examiner Building,
1111 S. Broadway, downtown L.A., 8 p.m. Regular schedule: Saturdays,
7 and 9:30 p.m.; Sundays, 5 and 7:30 p.m. Ends May 19. $15 to $25.
Opening night gala with reception, $75. (323) 655-8587.</TE>

<TE>   all day Movies</TE>
<TE>   Though not suited to everyone's taste, the baroque portraits of
eccentric characters created by director Wes Anderson and co-writer
Owen Wilson in "Rushmore" and "The Royal Tenenbaums" seem to grow
more delightful with repeated viewings. After the success of their
1996 debut, "Bottle Rocket," which launched the careers of Anderson,
Wilson and brother Luke Wilson, who appears in all three films, the
team unleashed Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a manic prep school
student at Rushmore Academy determined to win the love of an older
woman (Olivia Williams) from an odd millionaire, played by Bill
Murray. In last year's Oscar-nominated "Tenenbaums" screenplay, a
family of geniuses (Luke Wilson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller) who
peaked as teenagers, grapple with the attempted reconciliation by
their prodigal father, Royal (Gene Hackman).</TE>
<TE>   Wes Anderson-Owen Wilson double feature, New Beverly Cinema, 7165
Beverly Blvd., L.A. "The Royal Tenenbaums," Sunday, 3:30 and 7:30
p.m.; Monday and Tuesday, 7:30 p.m. "Rushmore," Sunday, 5:40 and 9:40
p.m. Monday and Tuesday, 9:40 p.m.; $3 to $6. (323) 938-4038.</TE>

<TE>   7:30pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Actor Marty Maguire reprises his critically acclaimed performance
of "A Night in November," Marie Jones' comic and poignant one-man
drama about an Irish Protestant's rejection of the blinders of
bigotry. Maguire plays a Belfast dole clerk who finds himself on a
journey of self-discovery when he takes his father-in-law to a World
Cup qualifying soccer match between the Republic of Ireland and
Northern Ireland. The Celtic Arts Center production inaugurates the
Falcon Theatre's new Sunday night play series, "Garry Marshall
Presents."</TE>
<TE>   "A Night in November," Falcon Theatre, 4252 Riverside Drive,
Burbank. Sundays at 7:30 p.m. Ends May 26. $25. (818) 955-8101.</TE>

<TE>   7:30pm Performing Arts</TE>
<TE>   "Pop Tarts," the performance laboratory at Highways Performance
Space curated by Marcus Kuiland-Nazario, presents an offbeat
observance of Cinco de Mayo. The eclectic offerings include Elia
Arce's work-in-progress with puppets, "Beverage Containers Only";
1980s New Wave pop diva Debora Iyall's "Forced Relocation Becomes
Me"; Linda Carmelo Sibio's excerpt from her new solo piece, "Panic
Attack," about a junk collector and her encounters with saints and
mystics through history; Erin Hirshe's "Cherry Noir," a voyeuristic
journey into the minds of two people on their wedding day; and an
on-the-edge collaboration between writer-musician Ted Quinn and
experimental songwriter Jemma.</TE>
<TE>   "Pop Tarts," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa
Monica, 7:30 p.m. $12. (310) 315-1459.</TE>

Sunday at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, examines
the journeys of Capt. James Cook, Charles Darwin and Sir Hans Sloane
as they explored Jamaica, Australia, the Galapagos Islands and other
parts of the world. Specimens, journals and other artifacts help tell
the story of the places, animals, plants and people encountered by
these adventurers and scientists.</TE>

Angeles County, 900 Exposition Blvd., L.A., Mondays to Fridays, 9:30

<LD>Holy cow! Aerosmith's Steven Tyler sang "Walk This Way" at the Viper
Room on Monday(!), with Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on
drums. Naturally, this cosmic convergence could only have happened
during a Metal Shop gig. Seems everyone's getting in on the fun at
the Viper's "Camaro" night, including "America's Most Wanted's" John
Walsh, who took his first night off since 9/11 last Monday by
partaking in some Metal Shop hysterics. Some 700 bad guys caught and
counting. Rock on, John.</LD>
<LD>   I'm starting to really dig the suburbs. For one thing, parents
couldn't find a better all-ages club for their kids than the Glass
House in Pomona. No alcohol, seasoned security and plenty of moshing
fun. Not too far away is the Block at Orange, where youngsters proved
a raucous punk show can still be a good time. To celebrate the
release of "Dogtown and Z-Boys," Suicidal Tendencies and the
Adolescents performed at the Block on Thursday, showing the grommets
how the big boys did it back in the day. On hand to celebrate the
skate culture flick were U.S. Bombs' Dwayne Peters, Pennywise and
director Stacy Peralta. The best part was the vintage played T.S.O.L.
between sets. Singer-songwriter Jack Grisham was ahead of his time.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of outer limits, don't miss "Tijuana" Thursdays at the El
Dorado Cantina in Brentwood. You can boogie down to hippoty-hop while
taking pictures on a donkey. Hee haw.... Shooter Jennings of Stargunn
is proving the apple doesn't fall far from the talent tree in his
Wednesday residency at the Viper Room. On hand to dig his groove last
week were Hank Williams III and Gram Parson's daughter, Polly.</TE>
<TE>   My pal Paul V. of Dragstrip 66 fame says they're putting on the
ritz Monday nights at the Argyle Hotel in WeHo. The weekly
swing-themed affair is dubbed Maxwell's at the Argyle, and it
includes live music, swanky attire and special performances by
Marilyn Manson's squeeze, Dita Von Teese, who showed up Monday with a
giant martini glass prop and little else. Cheers!</TE>

<HD>The Short Stop Is Long on History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINA LECARO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seems as if hip, new owners are trying to resuscitate every dive
bar in town these days. From former blue-collar barfly hangs like the
Well to previously gay-only pickup joints such as the Parlour and
4100, many of L.A.'s newest hot spots aren't new at all. But the past
lives of those trendy taverns can't rival that of the Short Stop.</LD>
<LD>   Proximity to Dodger Stadium inspired the name, but the Echo Park
watering hole's reputation came from its regulars, members of the
LAPD. The dark and cozy space is still adorned with cop memorabilia,
from badges to gun lockers to posters for films like "The Choir Boys"
(based on the book by Joseph Wambaugh, a former Short Stop regular).</LD>
<LD>   Police officers stopped patronizing the bar before the new owners
took over, in part because it was named as a hangout for corrupt
officers involved in the Rampart division scandal. By the end of
2000, business got so bad that the original owner sold it.</LD>
<TE>   The buyers were six friends and investors, all from the
entertainment industry, including former Afghan Whigs frontman Greg
Dulli, Grammy Award-winning album art designer Kevin Reagan and
screenwriter Oliver Wilson. They'd been itching to create a low-key
hang for the burgeoning artistic community on the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other rehabbed dives, the Short Stop kept its name, even
though it lost the old sign out front. The new owners made only a few
changes, quickly reopening the doors with a 2001 New Year's Eve
party. The place has been packing in a mix of local bohemian types
and young Hollywood heads ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's the ghosts of cops past keeping everybody in line, but
the Short Stop always seems to have a welcoming--even
safe--atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "We made an effort to make it really comfortable for women here,"
says Wilson. His stretch of Sunset Boulevard may not be the
swankiest, he says, but the community has a civic pride that deters
problems. "Nobody gets hassled here. We've never even had a fight."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday night, the girl-to-guy ratio seemed to be about
7 to 3. DJ Jason Mason spun a buoyant mix of punk and retro rock; the
bar's red-hued dance room was jammed with casual yet cool gals and a
couple of shaggy-haired fellows.</TE>
<TE>   The groovin' area gets even more packed during Wednesday's Dub
Club, a feel-good reggae night that attracts lots of young, stylish
urbanites. There's even a guy selling $1 tamales near the door, and
dub-clubbers gobble them up.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great place to drink and dance," says Melissa Baker, who
frequents the midweek gathering with a regular group of friends.
"Wednesdays are fun because the crowd is more friendly and familiar."</TE>
<TE>   Other nights here include "Girl's Night Out" on Tuesdays, with DJ
Leslie Napoles; "Evening Becomes Dyslexic," with DJs including
co-owners Dulli and Charles Gaiennie spinning obscure funk and soul;
and the Saturday night residency of popular electro-duo DJ Me DJ You.
On Sundays and Mondays the bar provides free play of its eclectic
jukebox and free games of pool. With another newish club, the Echo,
just down the street, the area seems to be flourishing, something

Stop--which still has bullet holes in its front door as reminders of
its intriguing past--maintains a feel of authenticity, even as it's
brimming with fashionable nymphs packing vintage Gucci bags. "It's a
real bar, in a real neighborhood, with a real history."</TE>

<DH>Mardi Gras in Toluca Lake has a lot more to offer than its
hearty jambalaya and po'-boys.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mardi Gras was closed for a party on Oscar night, not because the
Academy Awards are such a big deal in New Orleans but because it's
the Louisiana-themed restaurant for the Burbank-Toluca Lake movie and
TV district. Mardi Gras Gourmet Cajun-Creole Cuisine is the only
jambalaya emporium I know that has a VIP room and gives discounts to
studio employees.</LD>
<LD>   Needless to say, it's a stylish place. Along the counter that
separates the two smallish rooms sits a wrought-iron sculpture of
playful dancing geometric figures hung with Mardi Gras beads. The
walls are adorned with Mardi Gras posters and bayou paintings, and
the fish tank in the back seems to have a crayfish in it. (A pretty
nervous crayfish, if he has any idea what's going on here.)</LD>
<LD>   The food is mostly quite good, starting with the jambalaya. You
really can start there, because it's available as an appetizer as
well as an entree, and on Thursday nights they even give out free
samples. It has a peppery, tangy tomato sauce with plenty of sausage
and a hint of roux in it. You can get the gumbo as an appetizer too,
but it's a pallid version, tasting neither of file nor okra. I'd go
instead for the fried calamari in a sweet, rather shaggy breading
with two sauces for dipping, mustard and a powerful cocktail sauce.</LD>
<TE>   The po'-boy sandwiches range well beyond the usual oyster version;
there are shrimp, crayfish, catfish, chicken, beef and alligator
po'-boys here. Unlike the traditional loaf of French bread with a
filling, they're more like a conventional sandwich--a little more,
anyway. Imagine two diagonal slices out of a large French loaf, each
about 11/2 inches thick and 7 inches long, toasted, one topped with
thousand-island dressing and, say, deep-fried shrimp, the other with
lettuce, tomatoes and pickles.</TE>
<TE>   It's tasty, though kind of hard to get your mouth around. Either
carve it up into pieces you can eat with a fork or keep the napkins
handy. These sandwiches come with fries and either spoon bread--a
soft, almost pudding-like corn bread with a fresh corn flavor--or red
beans and rice. Both are also available a la carte as side dishes.
You can get the ham-scented beans and rice as an entree as well.</TE>
<TE>   A menu section of Creole dishes includes shrimp (or chicken,
lobster, snapper or alligator) Creole. Their tomato-based sauce is
certainly spicy but rather thin. The etouffees, available with the
same meats plus crayfish, strike me as much better. Their sauce is
basically just a roux made with browned flour enlivened with hot
pepper, but it's mouth-filling and aromatic.</TE>
<TE>   There are crab cakes, two small ones to an order, made of lump and
claw meat; the crab flavor is fine, but the texture is a little
mushy. They're improved by a spicy roux sauce.</TE>
<TE>   You can get deep-fried fish and blackened fish, but there's more
to New Orleans than those rough, earthy dishes. The broiled fish
dishes with a la carte sauces suggest sophisticated New Orleans
restaurants rather than the bayou. For instance, you can get broiled
Costa Rican red snapper topped with "emperor sauce," a luxurious hash
of shrimp, artichokes and mushrooms in garlic butter.</TE>
<TE>   For that matter, one of the specials one night was positively
Californian: beautifully seared ahi with a sauce that seemed to be
thinned orange marmalade with sesame seeds.</TE>
<TE>   At places like Pascale Manale's, New Orleans has its own way with
Italian food, spicier and more garlicky than usual; this menu has a
couple of Italian dishes in that style. Les deux is shrimp with
linguine in a rich, sweet cream sauce heavily dosed with garlic. (No
one seems to have an explanation for the name. "The two" what?)</TE>
<TE>   This all tends to be very rich and filling food, so what's at the
end of the menu? Rich, filling desserts. Sweet potato pecan pie,
chocolate bread pudding souffle, a shameless banana pudding.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday and Saturday nights, there's live blues, jazz, rock
and zydeco music in the patio adjoining the VIP room. So maybe you
could dance it off.</TE>

<AU>DEAN KUIPERS</AU>
<BD>Dean Kuipers is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer.
His last piece for Calendar Weekend was on the New Burlesque.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Me and Julian Schnabel, one on one, that's the way it'll be. A
private showing at the Gagosian gallery in Beverly Hills. Of course,
it's not Schnabel without a crowd, celebrities and paparazzi--a
thousand other people will be there, too.</LD>
<LD>   But it's good to squeeze past the doorman with no date in hand to
make witty critiques under her breath about the art fans in various
states of undress throwing panicked glances about the room. No
colleagues to pass along what people are saying about the five
paintings here, each about the size of the door to a single-car
garage. Tonight it's just me and Schnabel and these large ideas on
the wall that keep blurting out, "I am him!" Because the work is a
convergence point for what feels like a cult of personality, it seems
appropriate to meet it alone.</LD>
<LD>   The crowds are here to see the art, but they're also here to be
the art, and one has to be in the right mood to appreciate it. Why
risk having someone else along to break it down? Besides, being alone
in a room full of celebrities is not really like being alone. It's
like being with invisible friends. There's Viggo Mortenson (Strider
in "Lord of the Rings"), Mickey Rourke, John Waters, Dennis Hopper.</LD>
<TE>   We're all making the Schnabel thing together.</TE>
<TE>   That togetherness makes it a fun night to be alone. I run into
friends, but often the person they are with urges them to keep
moving, even if they want to talk. I am free to give all of my
attention or none. Artists themselves often go to openings alone, or
with other artists, as if to deny evidence of mainstream life like
spouses or children. Some of them are eager to talk. This is their
ocean, and the water is warm.</TE>
<TE>   Movie depictions of solitude in L.A. have one listening for a
wistful noir trumpet solo blowing from down the alley. But, on the
contrary, this is a great town for going out alone, and being alone
in it is one of its greatest luxuries. To be at the Schnabel show
alone is totally satisfying. Or to indulge in a guilty pleasure like
the latest blockbuster or trendy restaurant. In the most socially
deregulated city in America, no rule says your life must be like an
episode of "Friends." That's a lot of pressure and doesn't even look
like that much fun.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, you'll have to learn to ignore a barrage of media
messages telling you that solitude is a kind of pathology. I ran into
a gallerist at the Schnabel show who said, "I thought that going out
alone was supposed to be a drag." Advice columns tell women how to
avoid being pitied or hit on and tell men how to not look like a
psycho. But this approach seems to indicate deeper problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Being alone is really an important part of self-care," says "Dr.
Drew" Pinsky, an L.A. internist and teen relationship expert on MTV's
"Loveline." In the perennially adolescent world of Los Angeles, who
better to ask? "It's more than just taking a break from our busy
lives. If a person can't be healthy alone, I have serious doubts
about their ability to be healthy in a relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The lunch really is that naked.</TE>
<TE>   The fear of being alone also denies some basic facts. In L.A., we
end up going out alone all the time. How can we help it? According to
the 2000 census, almost three quarters of a million people in Los
Angeles County are "householders living alone." That's up 3.5% from
1990, and half a million of those people are under 65. That's a lot
of single people looking to go out. Not to mention those who are
partnered with a workaholic.</TE>
<TE>   Or those with a child who trade nights off. Or those with a
corporate job in which one's other is considered insignificant, like
agents or publicists, who end up not alone but surrounded by people
not of their choosing, which is a kind of loneliness, and one of the
worst.</TE>
<TE>   One of the reasons you live here is because the culture is deep
and alive, and you're going to end up wading in by yourself once in a
while. So let's institute a new policy of honesty. Protect the glory
of solitude, and repel the pain of loneliness. Don't be one of those
people who feigns disconnection: "Oh, I never go out." Because (a)
you do, and (b) you go out alone, and (c) you sometimes like it.</TE>
<TE>   "Pop is about liking things," Andy Warhol once said.</TE>
<TE>   And that requires courage. It means declaring yourself and being
prepared to defend that choice. But that doesn't mean you have to
fight that battle constantly. If there's something you want to keep
close to the vest, just go do it yourself.</TE>
<TE>   We all do this, to a certain extent, when it comes to taking care
of our bodies. A lot of Angelenos spend their precious free time
alone at the gym, running, doing yoga or surfing, maintaining some
semblance of physical fitness and sanity.</TE>
<TE>   But what about our minds? According to a friend of mine, who reads
scripts and books for film development at Miramax, the solitary
approach to entertainment and culture is more than an indulgence,
it's a philosophy. Especially when it comes to movies. Probably more
people go to movies alone than anything else one can do on a night
out, other than shopping. Just like there are date movies, there are
solo movies.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember seeing 'Cyrano' several years ago with a friend," she
says, "and when the lights came up I was wiping my eyes. And my
friend, who was pretty much doing her taxes in her head through the
whole thing, put her hand on my shoulder and sincerely inquired, 'Is
it because you have a big nose?' How much better the experience of
the film would have been without the social obligation to explain
that, no, it was not because I have a big nose."</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly why I had to sneak off by myself to see "The Lord
of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." Colleagues interested in
serious film like the latest Dogma 95 film dismiss this as big
special-effects puffery. But for those who read the books in
adolescence, it's hard to resist seeing it come alive with
transcendent actors like Ians McKellen and Holm, or to see
Hollywood's depiction of the psychedelic power of the ring itself.
The whole idea of having to instantly sum up your emotions, or to
explain what attracted you to a film in the first place, or to even
go mucking around in your reactions, is sometimes a drag.</TE>
<TE>   As counterintuitive as it may be, one of the most common refuges
for solitude and escape is the car. Can't take the crush of humanity
on L.A. streets? Well, get off for a drive somewhere. This is the one
I hear all the time: "I just couldn't take it anymore, so I drove out
to the desert." That kind of mindless drift usually ends in a motel
in Palm Springs. Desert Hot Springs. Joshua Tree. Vegas. An empty
highway is still the most direct line to the heart of this country,
and to our atrophied contemplative faculties.</TE>
<TE>   It's a way to make life and thought linear. The highway doesn't
have to be all that empty or long. No one can snake their way down
Mulholland Drive without feeling its strange mix of desert canyon
emptiness, self-conscious cultural iconography, and lack of all
destination other than Topanga and finally the sea. The car is also a
way to feel social without having to be social. Lots of the cars
cruising the Sunset Strip on Saturday night are a party of one. For
all the complaining that Angelenos do about their commutes, most
people also savor that time. The movie that is L.A. plays out on the
windshield, and you are your own character in it, inside your car
with your own dialogue and soundtrack and reasonable ending.</TE>
<TE>   If driving is about feeling connected to L.A. on a macro level,
then hiking is about connecting on the micro. When you hike directly
out of the city and, for instance, up to Griffith Park Observatory,
you feel as if you know a part of the city that's too intimate to
experience by car, by media or even by socializing. Hiking puts you
in touch with the very dirt shifting too and fro under the city, the
creosote bush and azaleas and ocotillo.</TE>
<TE>   When I hike alone, up Franklin Canyon in Beverly Hills, I like to
think of Edward Abbey's great book about solo hiking, "Desert
Solitaire."</TE>
<TE>   Not because of its deep bits, which are many and profound indeed,
but because Abbey admits that, while hiking days on end in open
desert, what he thinks about most often are women he's had sex with
and getting a cold beer.</TE>
<TE>   This adds levity to the drive up past the lunatic parade of
chateaux and mock Tudor next to mid-century modern next to
Mediterranean mansion. Once on the trailheads looping out from the
Franklin Canyon Reservoir and up into the dusty hills, all you have
to do is walk and let things get basic again.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing is more Los Angeles than dining out alone. And the
swankier, the better. Sure, stopping off for a macho burrito can be
damn satisfying with no one around to tell you not to. At 2 a.m.,
Pinks looks like a place of worship, our Angkor Wat. But since you're
alone, and whatever you do is going to be fairly inexpensive, why not
live a little? Grabbing a table at Les Deux or Lucques--and make sure
it's visible, one of the better tables, or even if it has to be at
the bar--opens up a whole new range of possibilities. After all, who
are you? The restaurant staff sure doesn't know.</TE>
<TE>   You can either hide out and enjoy a great meal, or engage the
physical separation from the other diners as an opportunity for fun.
With the right attitude, you're someone.</TE>
<TE>   Sushi is a great option, because chefs naturally focus on a solo
diner. I stopped off at the sushi bar at U-Zen in West L.A. on a
recent trip out alone and felt completely at ease. Unlike daters and
couples, the chefs know you're probably there for something special.
I played this up by asking the waitress for Ebisu, a delicious
Japanese beer usually not on the menu. They made me a chef's choice
dish, which turned out to be a triumphant monkfish liver presentation
and a special salad. The man from the couple sitting next to me
indicated that he wanted one of those, too.</TE>
<TE>   The sushi bar was fun because it was physically comfortable. Going
out alone almost always comes down to this. You're going to feel best
wherever the glorious solitude inside is matched by the atmosphere
and the people around you.</TE>
<TE>   Interactivity can make the night even better. For instance, the
Thursday "Cooking With Gas" improv show at the Groundlings theater
makes for a great night out. The 100 or so people who pack the tiny
theater on Melrose are a nice mix of couples, gangs of friends and
solitary patrons--and a good number are actors themselves, and that
makes for a slightly charged atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Thursday night, the cast included special guests Seth
Green ("Austin Powers," "Greg the Bunny"), Mindy Sterling (Frau
Farbissina from "Austin Powers"), Mike McDonald ("Mad TV"), and Dan
Castellaneta ("The Simpsons"). The director of "Cooking With Gas"
pops up in front of the small audience and fires questions like, "OK,
these two are having an argument: about what?"</TE>
<TE>   The audience shouts out responses--"dirty underwear!"--and that's
what they have to work with.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you like best about this?" asked the friendly young man
sitting next to me. I told him I was surprised at how funny
unscripted comedians can be, and that I felt included. Some of the
scenes were a howl and had the actors themselves busting up. "Yeah,
we're all part of it," he said. "The show depends on us." Afterward,
the cast comes out into the tiny lobby to answer questions and
mingle, and it felt pretty comfortable to stand around and talk to
the people I just met there.</TE>
<TE>   On the way home from the Groundlings, I stopped off at a Santa
Monica bar, Renee's Courtyard Cafe, where I know the bartenders and
feel at home. I thought more about what a kid at the theater had
pointed out: The couples talking and snuggling around me were
insulated from the world; they didn't have to interact, they had each
other. But the spectacle that is Los Angeles, the great nights that
leave you with great stories to tell, the great cultural push
forward, those require some acting out. They need a free radical to
set off the chemical reaction. I had another drink. The kid was
exactly right, the show depends on us.</TE>

<LD>Jim Hahn, mayor of Los Angeles: "I like to walk my dog around my
neighborhood."</LD>
<LD>   Catherine Dent, star of the TV series "The Shield": "My absolute
favorite alone time activity is to go to any artists' retrospective.
It really doesn't matter who it is, as long as their work and life
cover a good significant couple of years. I get the curator's
comments on tape, strap on the earphones and can go for a few hours.
And I have to go alone, because I want to look at all the artists'
work at my own speed. I love seeing another person's process.</LD>
<LD>   "I also like to get a venti nonfat, no-foam, extra-hot, extra-shot
caffe latte, go to the Barnes &amp; Noble, get a stack of decorating
magazines and sit in the back of the store and read for a few hours."</LD>
<TE>   Jill Giegerich, artist: "I go hiking alone in Rustic Canyon quite
a lot. There's all these relics down there, a hotel, houses, a horse
corral, but it's all been abandoned. It greatly appeals to my
post-apocalypse-nature-rejuvenation fantasy. It's really wild, and I
find that restorative."</TE>
<TE>   Roger White, architect: "I like to go to a coffee shop and scour
the paper. I think the corner cafe is a civilized thing. If you do
some kind of creative work, the process is nonlinear. So you need
time alone to let it stew and come to you in some way that has a
beginning and end."</TE>
<TE>   CCH Pounder, film and TV actress: "Art openings are my favorite
one-woman event in Los Angeles. Usually I like to go on that certain
Thursday in the month when there are several openings and you can
roam from one to the other. For most people, it's a time to
socialize, take in the free drinks and hors d'oeuvres and completely
ignore the art after the first 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to be alone in the crowd and visit the art without a
curator following me from one piece to the next (they are too busy on
opening night) and I can pay full attention to the work that's
presented."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Paige Smith, furniture designer: "I'd rather spend time
alone creating things than be with people or in bars. The bookstore
is the No. 1 thing I like to do for fun and inspiration and general
catching up with the world, researching new materials and processes.
That and surfing--even when you're with people you're really alone in
your own world."</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Sichler, director of operations for the DVD program BOOMtv:
"About the only thing I get to do by myself in L.A. is my biweekly
pedicure. And also yoga, it's really my favorite hour of the week."</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Silverman, actress in TV's "Greg the Bunny": "Listening
stations. I like to go to the Virgin Megastore or Tower or Amoeba and
listen to all the new music.</TE>
<TE>   Megyn Price, actress in "Grounded for Life": "I love going to
restaurants by myself, because I can read without having to feel
guilty for ignoring my dinner companion. In my job, I have to be 'on'
and sparkly all of the time, so I love the chance to just be a nerd.
I can just keep to myself and enjoy my meal."</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Fuller, clothing designer of the Natalie Anne line: "If
I'm on a mission to go shopping, then I go alone. That's when I get
what I want. If I'm with someone else, I end up helping the other
person, standing around while they try things on, and it becomes
slower and slower. The problem is that you want to concentrate on
your own look, but you don't want to be rude. You have to be selfish
at some point, otherwise you end up buying something boring."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy O'Dell, co-anchor of "Access Hollywood": "Some of my most
valuable alone time is on airplanes. I take a CD player and put
headphones on because I prefer not to talk on airplanes. Flying is a
great time to relax, think or read something I haven't had the chance
to. I also like to go to Barnes &amp; Noble alone and listen to various
CDs for sale--it is a great way to discover new music.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my favorite things to do to get away from it all is to
take a long, hot bubble bath with scented candles and incredible,
relaxing music in the background. This is one of the few indulgences
I'll allow myself quite often."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, I somehow got invited to a party for the metal band
Slayer at the Magic Castle. I've actually been on the road with
Slayer in Europe and have no small respect for its brand of bombast,
but I didn't know a single soul who would be at this party or what
would happen. So of course I went.</LD>
<LD>   The drive winds straight up a tall nob of Hollywood Hills right
behind the Highland Gardens Hotel on Franklin where Janis Joplin died
... which is at the dead end of the block of Orange Avenue where
Bobby Fuller ("I Fought the Law") was killed in the mid-'60s. The
locale's got all kinds of Hollywood juju on it.</LD>
<LD>   At night, the Magic Castle's interior is like the set from the old
vampire soap opera "Dark Shadows," all blood-toned woods and leaden
velvet curtains and secret alcoves. Magicians in black capes and hats
did tricks like a kind of undead dinner theater. It was packed. The
poisonous flower of goth rock was in full bloom that year.</LD>
<TE>   Being there alone, I became obsessed with trying all the
nonsensical doors, some of which lead nowhere. One led into a small,
velvet-lined theater that would seat maybe 100. It was empty except
for one guy in a lot of bondage-rocker gear, sort of an off-the-shelf
Marilyn Manson. We started talking. Because there was no smoking in
the Magic Castle, he said, he'd eaten his stash of marijuana. I
assumed he was sitting in the theater to chill out.</TE>
<TE>   No, he said, he was hiding from his girlfriend, who was in the
building somewhere making the scene in what he described as a
"Vampirella" get-up.</TE>
<TE>   He'd just realized he was going to dump her. Why, I asked,
Vampirella sounded alright.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're in a relationship you can't be the bent bow." That's
a line you don't forget. "You mean, like Nietzsche's bent bow?"</TE>
<TE>   Friedrich Nietzsche's bent bow represented the man under pressure,
the man forced under severe circumstances to outperform himself, the
isolated man perfecting the will to become the Overman.</TE>
<TE>   "Nietzsche's the man," he said. "The name of my band is going to
be the Wicked Archer."</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what happened to the wicked archer. But Los Angeles
is probably full of people like him, believing their power is sapped
not by loneliness but by social obligation. Some folks can't take the
clutter.</TE>

<HD>New Max Restaurant Is No Ordinary Joe</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years as chef at Linq on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles,
Andre Guerrero has finally opened his own place, on the site of
JoeJoe's in Sherman Oaks. Astute remodeling and a pale palette have
given this boxy storefront space an updated, sophisticated look.
Mirrors hang over the plush, high-backed banquettes, and an intimate
little nook has been carved out to one side of the main dining room.
What a difference from JoeJoe's warm, casual charm.</LD>
<LD>   Recently I brought along some friends who live in the Valley to
Max. Remodeling their kitchen, they've been forced to eat out every
night for months. The good restaurants in the Valley are always the
same, they complain: Posto, Pinot Bistro, and maybe Bistro Garden.
But how often can you eat the same food?</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero's menu at Max, which is named for his younger son, is
definitely different--as multicultural as Los Angeles. Carpaccio of
beets comes with a Greek salad. A mushroom risotto is garnished with
duck confit. Hamachi sashimi is paired with green tea soba noodle
salad, and cod is cooked in an Indian spice masala crust.</LD>
<TE>   One bite of the lumpia, like thin spring rolls with a shrimp and
pork stuffing, and my friend pronounces Max better than anything in
the Valley. Not that he jumps to conclusions or anything.</TE>
<TE>   What's sure is that in this small restaurant, Guerrero's cooking
has the chance to shine. Dainty chicken-mushroom dumplings bob in a
Thai lemongrass-coconut soup. Miniature ahi towers are thatched with
matchsticks of seaweed. And "hawker's chicken," chicken breast
marinated and threaded on a skewer, gets a jolt from a puckery green
papaya relish.</TE>
<TE>   He even does a definitive version of New York pepper steak with a
sharp blast of black peppercorns, served with sauteed spinach and a
lovely Gorgonzola-potato gratin.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving Linq and its trendy scene behind, Guerrero can now just
focus on cooking. It must be nice.</TE>

<DH>Storytellers in Ojai will showcase an art that has retained
its power into the Digital Age.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERNESTO LECHNER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antonio Sacre remembers vividly the first time he saw a professional
storyteller in action. At the time, Sacre was a 23-year-old aspiring
actor visiting a Chicago festival.</LD>
<LD>   "I saw this one man sitting on a stool, telling a story that was
actually quite boring," he recalls. "But people of all ages were
enthralled just by listening to him. A bunch of 3-year-olds were
giggling so hard that they were crying. There was a
cross-generational excitement in the air that was new to me. You
don't find that in the theater or the movies."</LD>
<LD>   Ten years later, Sacre has become a well-established professional
storyteller. He travels around the country, hired by festivals and
colleges to tell stories about his life growing up in a bicultural
environment, the son of a Cuban father and an Irish American mother.</LD>
<TE>   Storytelling is certainly an old-fashioned proposition in this day
and age, when consumers are confronted with a dizzying variety of
choices when it comes to entertainment. Still, the ages-old format
refuses to die.</TE>
<TE>   The third-annual edition of Village of Tales, a four-day festival
devoted to the art of the well-told story, begins today in Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   The Beverly Hills Public Library routinely presents programs with
some of the best tellers in the country. And in November, Los Angeles
will experience the premiere of its very own international festival,
organized by DreamShapers, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the
preservation and sharing of storytelling.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing more powerful than a good story," says Brian
Bemel, president of Performances to Grow On, the organization behind
Village of Tales. "And we don't really listen to stories anymore.
Everybody's busy watching television or talking to each other on a
computer. We've distanced ourselves from an art form that's primal
and allows you to connect to other people."</TE>
<TE>   Hebe Lein, a psychologist, occasionally uses narrative therapy as
a healing technique. "Stories are part of our cultural identity,"
Lein says. "We love stories because they take us back to our
childhood and calm our anxieties. In most tales, problems are
resolved in a magical way."</TE>
<TE>   It seems bizarre, even unrealistic, to expect storytelling to
become a popular format when entertainment is all about the pounding
razzle-dazzle of digital media. Why listen to an ordinary person
telling a story when you can easily indulge in a frantic overdose of
violent video games, sexy music videos and trashy reality shows?</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to be lured by the seduction and excitement of modern
technology," Sacre agrees. "But storytelling gives you the kind of
connection that you don't get from television or the Internet. The
teller of a story can see you and react accordingly. By listening to
him, you become part of the story. There's something very magical
about that."</TE>
<TE>   Storytelling has also become quite a sophisticated art form,
incorporating music, dance and elaborate props, elements that help
bring the stories to life.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is that people don't really know what a storyteller
is," Bemel says. "They think it's just somebody reading a book. They
don't know how powerful and theatrical it can be. When you're in the
presence of a really good teller, you forget that you're even in the
audience and that there's people around you."</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly, children and teens--the kind of demographic that
you would expect to be particularly dismissive of storytellers--are
vital parts of these events. "This year, we have 1,200 kids coming to
our first performance, and the second one is almost sold out," Bemel
says. "Even though the kids have not been exposed to the format,
their teachers know the value of it. And those who have attended
always want to come back."</TE>
<TE>   "Even seventh- and eighth-graders love my stories," Sacre adds.
"I've told stories to kids in jail, to gang members, and then again
to rich kids who go to expensive boarding schools. You gotta have
faith in your craft.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell a good story, they'll listen."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the key to the endurance of storytelling might lie in
its ritualistic aspect and in the healing power of the communal
experience it offers. We become one as we sit under the stars in deep
concentration, visualizing the hypnotic story that is unfolding in
front of us.</TE>
<TE>   "If the connection is there, you begin to approach the essence of
what being human is all about," Sacre says. "Listening to someone's
story is like giving him a beautiful gift. It's very hard to hate
someone once you've listened to his story."</TE>
<TE>   Village of Tales, Ojai Storytelling Festival, Ojai. Today through
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Locations vary depending on the event. Weekend passes and tickets
for individual events can be purchased by phone or online.

around the country, I always ask the people if there are any real
haunted places, 'cause I always like to go there and see if I can
experience anything. Last October, I did an appearance at an old
stone penitentiary from the 1800s in downtown Philadelphia, and
supposedly it's haunted. I have a ghost of a small child in my house
that I've seen twice. The first time, I saw this little kid that
disappeared into the cabinet in my upstairs hallway. And I thought,
"I haven't been drinking or anything, so that's pretty strange." And
then I saw him out of the corner of my eye one other time. It's not
an old house or anything, and I know the person that owned the house
before me didn't have any kids.</LD>
<TE>   Rocky Road: I've shot various things out at Vasquez Rocks, which
is on the way to Palmdale. I like the bizarre scenery out there. The
rocks are all at crazy angles because of earth movement. It just
looks like some place out of a movie, and that's probably why they do
so many movies there. I go rock climbing, but not the kind you see on
TV where people are hanging on by their fingernails. I just like to
climb up through the rocks.</TE>
<TE>   Don't Jump Off the Roof: The big stunt hangout is the Sagebrush
Cantina out here in Calabasas. It used to be really rustic and it's
been updated a bit, but it's still a big hangout for stunt people.
Every time, I go there I see a stunt person that I know. It's a
casual, sawdust-on-the-floor type of place. They serve a lot of good
Mexican food, burgers and beer. Gotta have that beer.</TE>
<TE>   Slasher in the Back Row: My favorite theater in all of L.A. is
Grauman's Chinese, because I went to see the first Jason movie that I
did there and the place was packed. There were crazy crowds, and it
was just amazing to experience a movie like that. I also went to see
the re-release of "The Exorcist" there, which is my all-time favorite
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Meditation Spot: There is a spot that I don't want to pinpoint,
because I don't want a lot of other people to know about it. But it's
up Stunt Road, outside of Calabasas. And if you go up to the top of
the mountain, there's a little trail and on top, there's an amazing,
360-degree view of the San Fernando Valley all the way to the ocean.
They should have some sort of lookout built there, but they don't, so
nobody knows about it. That's where I go to sit and dream up new ways
of killing people for the films. I clear my head and think of nothing
but cinematic violence.</TE>

<HD>A Peruvian Treasure</HD>
<DH>Song-and-dance ensemble Peru Negro makes a long-awaited
U.S. debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When slave masters in colonial Peru banned drums, the slaves found
new ways to preserve their outlawed rhythms. They used tables and
chairs and almost anything that made noise when struck by a bamboo
stick or slapped by the palm of a hand.</LD>
<LD>   In the fields, workers expropriated wooden crates as impromptu
percussion instruments. They discovered that the crates, emptied of
fruits and vegetables, made a surprisingly rich range of sounds,
depending on where and how they were struck.</LD>
<LD>   Those humble boxes eventually evolved into a formal percussion
instrument called the cajon, now a proud national symbol of Peru.
Instead of eradicating the old rhythms and rituals, considered the
devil's work, Spanish church and civil authorities had unwittingly
helped create a new genre: the music of black Peru, one of the most
vibrant styles in the hemisphere.</LD>
<TE>   Southern Californians will have the opportunity to see the prime
exponents of this exciting music in concert for the first time when
Peru Negro, a 26-member song-and-dance ensemble formed in 1969 by a
former bus driver, makes its U.S. debut tonight at UCLA's Royce Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Under the direction of its late founder, choreographer Ronaldo
Campos de la Colina, the group helped spark a revival of the genre
with its showcase of colorful costumes, sensual dances and historic
verses that were often preserved through oral tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Its members perform with an array of authentic instruments,
including the quijada de burro, a donkey jaw used as a shaker and
scraper for its rattling teeth. Their dances, the lando and the
festejo, are accompanied by suggestive pelvic movements that once
earned condemnation from the dominant white society as immoral,
contributing to the music's once marginalized status.</TE>
<TE>   "There was high-class culture and there was low-class culture,"
says Juan Morillo, the group's U.S. manager and a doctoral candidate
in history at Claremont Graduate University. "High-class culture
would have been imported. In other words, whatever came from the
outside was considered high-class. Black music simply wasn't
recognized until recently."</TE>
<TE>   Overdue recognition began in the 1950s with the nation's black
artistic revival, led by poet, composer and musicologist Nicomedes de
Santa Cruz. Before founding Peru Negro, Campos de la Colina played
the cajon with another seminal black group, Pancho Fierro.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, however, most people are still unfamiliar
with Peru's rich black cultural traditions. When they think of
Peruvian music, many think of the Andean folk style, with its
mournful pan pipes and flutes popularized by Simon &amp; Garfunkel's 1970
hit "El Condor Pasa."</TE>
<TE>   The music of black Peru is earthier, less ethereal. It is the
urban music of Peru, cultivated in Pacific coastal towns such as
Canete and El Carmen, where Peru Negro was founded. They served as
settlements for slaves working the region's cotton and sugar cane
fields.</TE>
<TE>   From these black communities, the music migrated to the capital,
Lima, where it survived in segregated black neighborhoods, disparaged
and almost forgotten until the renaissance of the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   This is soulful, melodic music with loping rhythms only distantly
related to their more popular Afro-Cuban cousins, such as the son or
the rumba. Unlike slaves in Cuba, who were allowed to keep African
customs alive in communities with family and tribal ties, the slaves
in Peru came from small, unrelated and dispersed groups, a strategy
designed to discourage rebellion around tribal chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Cut off from ancestral memories, black Peruvians developed a
distinct style, devoid of African language or santeria religious
references, which still infuse its Afro-Cuban counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   The work of black Peruvian artists was first spotlighted in the
U.S. on "The Soul of Black Peru," a 1995 compilation on Luaka Bop
Records. It includes songs by Peru Negro and its vocal alumnae Eva
Allyon and Lucila Campos, who are today among Peru's most popular
stars, along with Susana Baca, who went on to record solo albums for
the label.</TE>
<TE>   Although Peru Negro has traveled all over the world in its 33-year
history, concert promoters always balked at the cost of a U.S. tour
for a company that numbered almost three dozen members at its peak.
Its founder always refused to travel with a pared-down troupe,
claiming it would violate its artistic integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Promoters such as Morillo still remember the response of Campos de
la Colina, who died last year of a brain hemorrhage at age 73: "We
all go, or nobody goes."</TE>
<TE>   Peru Negro, now under the artistic direction of the founder's son,
Ronny Campos, currently has 26 members. All but four are scheduled to
come on this tour, says the group's lead singer, Monica Duenas, who
is married to Ronny Campos and serves as director of a company for
children, Peru Negrito.</TE>
<TE>   Duenas recalls how her late father-in-law painstakingly documented
the ancient tradition, often relying on tape recordings of songs sung
by his mother. One of the most famous old numbers, originally
recorded by the group in 1973, was "Toro Mata," made popular
worldwide two years later in a salsa version by Cuban singer Celia
Cruz. A more traditional version of the song is included on Peru
Negro's third album, "Sangre de un Don," released in 2000 on Times
Square Records.</TE>
<TE>   Authenticity was a cornerstone of Campos de la Colina's artistic
approach. "He was always very strict about the discipline of the
group, so that all the dances would be perfect," Duenas says. "He was
a very proper person in that regard."</TE>
<TE>   The Lima-based group has remained a family affair, with nieces,
nephews, grandchildren, in-laws and even the offspring of former
members, says Duenas, 39, whose own children, ages 8, 11, and 16, are
now dancing in the group.</TE>
<TE>   "Peru Negro will never die, as long as the family exists," she
says.</TE>

$45, $35, $25 and students, $15. (310) 825-2101.</TE>

<HD>A Colorful Jason Moran Trio</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Moran's adventurous opening set at the Jazz Bakery on Tuesday
night triggered thoughts about the demands facing every young jazz
pianist working within the classic trio instrumentation of piano,
bass and drums.</LD>
<LD>   Like the classical string quartet, the jazz piano trio contains
all the potential of much larger ensembles. But that potential comes
with a major challenge: the sparkling history of piano achievements
reaching from Jelly Roll Morton and Art Tatum to Cecil Taylor and
Bill Evans.</LD>
<LD>   That Moran, still in his 20s, has been able to generate a unique
musical persona for himself is testimony to his expanding presence as
an important new talent.</LD>
<TE>   At the Bakery, working with longtime associates Tarus Mateen on
bass and Nasheet Waits on drums, Moran concentrated on material from
his current Blue Note album, "Black Stars."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting his omnivorous musical curiosity, the pieces offered a
colorful buffet of styles. Moran's own "Gangsterism on a River" (one
of several Moran works using the "Gangsterism" prefix reminiscent of
his work with the M-Base musical collective) and "Skitter In" were
juxtaposed against Jaki Byard's "Out Front" and Duke Ellington's
"Kind of Dukish."</TE>
<TE>   Adding more diversity, Moran combined Ravel's "Le Tombeau de
Couperin" with his own "State of Art," moving smoothly from Ravel's
floating harmonies into his own, similarly textured phrases.</TE>
<TE>   The playing by all the participants was equally multifaceted.
Moran made particularly effective use of a dynamic sense of touch,
sometimes hammering his notes, sometimes floating through his lines
with an immaculate sense of tone. And when he played an utterly
idiosyncratic version of "Body and Soul," he suggested one of the
possibilities for new perspectives on standard tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Harkening back to the question of how a young artist deals with
the rich history of the piano trio, Moran's interaction with Mateen
and Waits suggested that he is determined to follow an equally
innovative path in that area as well. Breaking up song structures,
throwing the lead back and forth to the other players, using bass and
drum solos for dramatic emphasis in unexpected places, he sounded
very much like a player with a compellingly original creative agenda.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Moran Trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave. Today through
Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Downtown Hot Spot Can Be Too Cool for Words</HD>
<DH>Tuesday Night Cafe in Little Tokyo is a free outdoor venue
for poetry and more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLARE KLEINEDLER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the roar of an overhead helicopter attempts to drown out his
poetry, Eddie Kim clears his throat and raises his voice.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm riding to school on a bicycle. I fall down and scratch my
knees. I'm crying. I'm crying.... And then I realize I'm 23," he
says, his voice quivering slightly from the cold.</LD>
<LD>   Now it's the audience that's roaring as Kim takes a quick bow and
returns to his seat.</LD>
<TE>   Competing with outdoor noise and chilly weather isn't a problem
for Kim or any of the dozen performers who regularly participate in
the Tuesday Night Cafe. The free event, which takes place on the
first and third Tuesday of every month, is held at the Union Center
for the Arts in Little Tokyo--or, rather, outside the theater in the
courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   Since it started in early 1999, the cafe has become the place for
spoken-word poets, musicians, singers and dancers to try out new
material in a live setting. The people who attend come with an open
mind and a supportive attitude; if an artist's work isn't
appreciated, they might get only a few claps, but they're never booed
or ridiculed.</TE>
<TE>   This atmosphere is what poet Traci Kato-Kiriyama, 28, had in mind
when she first dreamed up the cafe a few years ago. Along with
friends Glenn Suravech and Ryan Suda, Kato-Kiriyama got permission
from the Little Tokyo Service Center (which owns the theater) to use
the courtyard for an ongoing performing arts night.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the day Traci told me about it," says Suravech, 34,
who performs in the cafe's house band. "We were sitting at this
restaurant and she said, 'You know, I want to start this scene.' We
were comparing it to something like [the band] Ozomatli and the music
events they had which led to their scene--we used that as a model for
this. So we basically just started with a microphone and a karaoke
machine and just did it."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the karaoke machine gave way to more professional
sound equipment, lighting and even a designated host to introduce the
performers. With no budget, people had to donate their time and
expertise--something they did with no complaints. Suda, 31, started
taking on various tech-related duties such as sound and recording,
while another friend, Gerry Linsangan, 38, volunteered his lighting
skills to ensure that the performers looked good. Kato-Kiriyama
booked the acts and created an e-mail list to spread the word about
the cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone pitched in, and we improvised," Suda says. "A few times
we couldn't get the lights up or there wasn't enough extension cord,
but we managed to pull together and get through it."</TE>
<TE>   Since its meager beginnings, the cafe has far exceeded
Kato-Kiriyama's dream of a place for Asian American and all local
performers to have their art seen and heard. The scene has given a
little bit of life to this part of downtown, which is normally
dead-calm after business hours. More importantly, the cafe has
inspired "normal people," as Linsangan puts it, "to get out there and
become artists themselves."</TE>
<TE>   One of those former "normal people" is the cafe's host,
22-year-old Johneric Concordia. A self-proclaimed "counselor,
community organizer, thief and dropout," Concordia warmly introduces
each artist with a quick joke and a smile. He also performs his own
poetry and is a favorite among regular attendees.</TE>
<TE>   "In June 2000, my best friend, Arnold Moreno, died in an
accident," says Concordia, explaining how he came to be a poet. "Due
to his lack of insurance, he was sent to four different hospitals; he
died [at the hospital] two blocks from where we live. He was a poet,
and he inspired me to write. My first piece was about the
circumstances of his death, which I performed at the cafe for the
first time. It was a fund-raiser for Arnold's funeral."</TE>
<TE>   Even Kato-Kiriyama's own spoken-word trio, Zero 3, was born out of
the Tuesday Night Cafe. Though she and fellow Zero 3 member Kennedy
Kabasares, 33, had been performing separately for several years,
member Edren Sumagaysay had never read a piece of work aloud until he
started attending the cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so scared! I sat down in a chair and there was a microphone
in front of me.... My hands were shaking, my voice was shaking and I
wasn't even looking at the audience," says Sumagaysay, 27. "I read
it, and I thought it [was terrible], but then I heard applause, and I
got this feeling of, 'Well, I guess it [wasn't] that bad!'"</TE>
<TE>   Whether it is a Japanese flutist playing traditional music, a trio
of flame-throwers or an amateur spoken-word poet, the cafe and its
audience welcomes everyone. And though the majority of performers are
Asian American, the cafe is open to any local artist, Kato-Kiriyama
says.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first moved here from Chicago, I moved into the Little
Tokyo Hotel [down the street from the cafe], and these guys used to
keep me up all night!" jokes Umar Rashid, 25. "So I came down to
check it out, and even though it was a little intimidating because
the majority of the performers were Asians, I got over it quick
because everyone here is so supportive. I read my stuff here on a
regular basis now."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Sumagaysay: "That's what we tell people. Just come down and
check it out and see how you feel."</TE>

<LD>   Anna Christie--Those who inextricably link this play with the
famous 1930 film starring Greta Garbo will find this production at
Pacific Resident Theatre a revelation. Granted, given today's
bare-all, tell-all standards, Eugene O'Neill's drama is hardly likely
to seriously rankle anyone's proprieties. However, its emotional
force remains undiminished by time.</LD>
<LD>   That's largely due to the close-to-the-bone direction by Gar
Campbell, whose emphasis on the play's psychological truth relegates
Garbo's performance to the history books. Victoria Profitt's scenic
art design and David Dionisio's scenic design combine to give the
production an appropriately stripped-down, penurious look--"Lower
Depths" on the waterfront. Kellie Canning's costumes look
unobtrusively well-worn, Keith Endo's lighting is as flickering and
changeable as the ocean itself, and Kevin Rahm's subtle sound design
is exceptional--all creaking timbers and distant bells.</LD>

<LD>Video</LD>
<LD>   "Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party." The Wiggles. HIT
Entertainment. VHS, $15; DVD, $20; music cassette, $7; CD, $11. Ages
1 to 8.</LD>
<LD>   Greg, Jeff, Anthony and Murray, the four Aussies who, as the
Wiggles, are the mega-stars of Australian kids' TV and kids' music,
return with another of their wildly staged musical romps. As goofy as
they look in their 1960s lettermen-style pullovers and black slacks,
that goofiness, paired with the quartet's seemingly inexhaustible
energy, pulls viewers into a colorful world of jokes and banter,
short animations, loads of real kids to watch, skits, costumed
characters and music, music, music.</LD>
<TE>   Every choreographed and fully staged number is an invitation to
viewers to bop along to folk songs and original tunes--where else can
kids learn to "Move Like an Emu"?</TE>
<TE>   The costumed characters--Dorothy, a demure dinosaur; Wags the Dog;
and Henry the Octopus--are kid-pleasers, too, although a little
Captain Feathersword, played by an actor who mugs up a storm in lacy
pirate shirt and eye patch, goes a long way. Love the vest with magic
buttons, though.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Sheira &amp; Loli's Dittydoodle Works: Ditties for Little Kiddies,
Vol. 1," Rogar Studios. VHS, $13; cassette, $9; CD, $12. 44 minutes.
Ages 1 to 6. (800) 99DITTY.</TE>
<TE>   This modest edutainment for preschoolers is actually a 22-minute
video that repeats itself, and that might be a bit more manufactured
fun than parents can take in one sitting. Inoffensive, sprightly
songs with worthy messages aside--"Be What You Wanna Be," "Change
Your Mind"--the show's characters lack charm and the breathless pace
is a little wearing.</TE>
<TE>   Sheira and Loli, the rag doll twins, are played by actors in
bodysuits wearing enormous doll heads that never change expression;
their "Funkins" friends are two pink and blue, googly-eyed creatures
with lolling pink tongues--more bodysuit costumes--while another
regular, Professor Eeky Eeky Kronk, a very large man with incongruous
gray curls and a doctor's lab coat, capers about with a toothy grin.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about the video is the way it brings children into
the mix for a few knock-knock jokes and musical numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Audio</TE>
<TE>   "One Little Sound, Fun With Phonics and Numbers." Hap Palmer.
Hap-Pal Music. CD, $14; cassette, $10. (818) 885-0200. www.happal
mer.com</TE>
<TE>   How many "chunks" do you hear in "Chipmunk"? "What can you knock
that starts with D?" Hap Palmer proves again why he is one of the
best educational music-makers in the country in this ear-pleasing,
think-along, sing-along release. Breaking words like "Chickadee and
Chipmunk" into "chunks" helps young listeners understand the concept
of syllables; sounding out letters is the key to a "Secret Word"
song; and listeners "Bounce" through initial consonants.</TE>
<TE>   Other tracks lead the way through recognizing vowel sounds
consonant blends, and concepts of simple subtraction and addition.
Vocals and instrumentals in jazz, folk and pop styles are top-notch.
A guide with lyrics and learning activities is included.</TE>
<TE>   Musical Note: Children's recording artist Ralph Covert, who has
earned a national following for his "Ralph's World" CDs--his newest
release is the all-ages-pleasing "At the Bottom of the Sea"--will
appear in concert at Storyopolis, 116 N. Robertson Blvd., Plaza
Level, Suite A, L.A., on Saturday at noon.</TE>
<TE>   Children, $10; adults, free. (310) 358-2500.</TE>

<LD>* New this week: A celebrated perfectionist, filmmaker Michael Mann
is determined in "Ali" to tell the story of the heavyweight
champion--who changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali and
became the 20th century's most celebrated athlete--with a phenomenal
attention to detail. That very much includes the impressive
Oscar-nominated performance of star Will Smith. The difficulty with
the film is not that there aren't good things about it but that there
aren't enough of them. Perhaps having a universally revered
individual who is still very much alive as protagonist caused the
filmmakers to unconsciously pull back from an examination that cuts
deeper than this one does. Whatever the reason, the energy and
hold-onto-your-seat excitement that Muhammad Ali brought to the
sports world is oddly absent from this quite accomplished but finally
distant film.</LD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The print's really bad, but the film is good!" So yelled German
filmmaker Peter Sempel as the lights went down on a recent screening
of his best-known work, the 1988 film "Dandy." Playing to an overflow
crowd equal parts blue-haired goth kids and graying high-culture
aficionados at the Goethe Institut, Sempel had just finished
excitedly introducing the film, the first in a partial retrospective
that culminates with tonight's U.S. premiere of "Lemmy," his look at
the leader of hard-rock band Motorhead, and Sunday with a special
presentation at American Cinematheque of his multi-projector "Kino
Extreme."</LD>
<LD>   Making the rounds of world cultural institutions in celebration of
20 years as a filmmaker, Sempel, 49, has carved out a niche for
himself as a chronicler of post-punk bohemia, making films that are
part documentary, part psychodrama. Although his subjects may include
a cross section of highbrows and hardscrabblers--Jonas Mekas, founder
of the underground New York film space Anthology Film Archives;
singer Nick Cave; Japanese butoh dance master Kazuo Ohno; guitarist
Blixa Bargeld--Sempel's films are always at least in part about
himself.</LD>
<TE>   On a sunny afternoon before the evening screening of "Dandy,"
Sempel takes a break from hanging and organizing the photo exhibition
that accompanies his film series to sit for an interview in the
courtyard of the Goethe Institut's Mid-Wilshire offices. Literally in
the shadow of offices housing E! Entertainment Television and
Variety, neither of which will be rushing to cover his work any time
soon, the incongruity of the setting only makes Sempel's
proselytizing, by turns earnestly heartfelt and infuriatingly
self-serving, seem that much more out there.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are making something, you don't realize, you just make.
You realize afterwards," he says by way of explaining his process and
intentions. Born in Germany but raised through his teenage years in
Australia, he eventually returned to Hamburg, where he still lives.
He speaks in a rush with an idiosyncratic accent. "My films are music
and dance films. I'm not a thinking filmmaker. Which may be a problem
for you interviewing me today. But when I'm working I'm not thinking.
And once I'm done, I say, 'Hey, what did I do?' How do I know what I
am doing when I am doing it? I just know that I'm doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Sempel usually takes years to finish his films, partly out of
financial necessity and partly out of a desire to create the most
complete portraits of his subjects. "They're not actually portraits,"
he explains. "They're more like moments. I suppose they are very
personal portraits, as I see them. I'm not documenting anything. I'm
using them to show how I see the world. A person has many different
angles and moments. Like a painter needs many colors. So I get all
the moments and colors I can and then I make my painting at the
editing table."</TE>
<TE>   Considering the work involved, Sempel chooses his subjects
carefully. Mostly they come from his own pantheon of personal heroes.
"'Hero' is not the right word," he corrects. "I'd say I love them.
Nick and Blixa, how can you not love them? Lemmy, once you get to
know him, you have to love him. Otherwise, you'd never work with
these people. The films require two or three years' work.</TE>
<TE>   "In the process of making my film on Jonas Mekas, somehow Al
Pacino wanted to be in it. His managers were against it, but we have
a nice moment with him. It's important these Hollywood people support
the avant-garde, the underground, because without them Hollywood
wouldn't be what it is. All those camera tricks? Excuse me, where do
they come from? They should be forced to support the arts more
because so many ideas and techniques come from the poor, hard-working
bums of the art world. It's true."</TE>
<TE>   For someone who decries commercialism, Sempel seems to define
himself by his own proximity to famous people. For example, would his
footage of Nick Cave bungee jumping in "Jonas in the Desert" seem
quite as exciting were it not Nick Cave? "I've often had people say,
'Oh, Peter Sempel films are just about celebrities.' It doesn't
disturb me, but that's not my reason for doing it," he responds. "I'd
be happy if Nick Cave was not so famous. It's becoming much more
difficult to get a camera on him."</TE>
<TE>   As seemed to be the case at the recent "Dandy" screening, what of
those people who come to his films largely to see the stars? "It's
often that way," he concedes, "and that's no problem for me. The
point is they watch the film and then they like the film too, not
just to see their star. But the main thing is they take it seriously
and treat it with respect, that they don't go just because it's
fashionable. That's the problem with so many of the undergrounders,
it becomes fashion. I'm never sure how many go because their emotions
and their heart are with this film or this concert, or because they
heard about it and it's the thing to do. Fans are good people who
really love the stuff. Making 'Lemmy,' I've seen so many Motorhead
fans who just love and adore that band. They don't care how popular
they are. And that's how I feel too."</TE>
<TE>   Considering Sempel's art-world credentials, a rock 'n' roller like
Lemmy Kilmeister might seem a strange subject. Having been introduced
by a mutual acquaintance (and Sempel subject), musician Nina Hagen,
the two hit it off. Following the band on tour, into the studio and
around Lemmy's L.A. haunts, Sempel explains, "he confirmed what I
thought might be true--how elegant and delicate and kind-hearted and
tender he can be. Very poetic and extremely political as well. Ozzy
Osbourne says in my film that Lemmy is totally underrated. He says if
an atom bomb fell, there would be three survivors: cockroaches, Keith
Richards and Lemmy."</TE>
<TE>   Sempel has performed his "Kino Extreme" only a handful of times,
and Sunday will mark its Los Angeles premiere. Asked to explain it,
Sempel grabs a pen and flier to draw a convoluted diagram. Using
three projectors, he shows his films all at once, sometimes even
letting the images overlap. Changing reels around as he goes, images
from one film might appear in different places on the screen, while
he also does a live sound mix.</TE>
<TE>   "The point is, as you're watching, suddenly, say, Blixa Bargeld,
who appears in many of my films, is on all three screens at once,
like a flash. All three films come together like an opera, and you
won't believe your head."</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, "Kino Extreme" is Sempel's culminating work,
bringing together his interests in music, film, performance and
chance. "Other filmmakers, Mekas for example, every film goes with
another film, their whole life is one film. Now I've put all of mine
on one screen. Every time I do it, it's a different show."</TE>
<TE>   Part artist, part huckster and all energy, Sempel shows only a
momentary lapse in his seemingly boundless enthusiasm for his own
work. "I wouldn't want to promote the 'Kino Extreme' too much, as
it's a side thing, an exotic experience. The films as such are what's
important to me. And I wouldn't want to do it too often; it's too
exhausting."</TE>

<HD>They Brought Life to the British Cinema</HD>
<DH>A Cinematheque series celebrates the venturesome filmmaking
of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So sacred was the word in vintage British cinema that the majority of
filmmakers never quite got to the imagery. A lot of these movies,
some of them certainly worthy, strike Americans as talky and slow, no
matter how beautifully acted. As a result, filmmakers who harnessed
the visual power of the camera stood out boldly in contrast with
their contemporaries, even those who made entertaining films. Among
these exceptions to the British rule, Alfred Hitchcock topped the
list, but not far behind was the venturesome team of Michael Powell
and Emeric Pressburger.</LD>
<LD>   The American Cinematheque presents A Matter of Life and Death: The
Films of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger today through next
Thursday at the Egyptian. Fans of the team--by and large Powell
directed and Pressburger wrote and they co-produced--will want to dip
into the various rarely seen films in this series. But those newly
acquainted with the filmmakers will want to check out their most
celebrated work, which screens Saturday, starting with the beloved
1949 "The Red Shoes" (Saturday at 5 p.m.). It's a bravura romantic
fantasy in ravishing color, starring Moira Shearer as a ballerina
pursued by two overpowering personalities, Anton Walbrook's
impresario and Marius Goring's composer.</LD>
<TE>   "Stairway to Heaven" (1946), released in the U.K. as "A Matter of
Life and Death," screens at 7:45 p.m. World War II inspired a number
of fantasies about last-minute reprieves from heaven's doorstep, and
this is one of the most durable and persuasive, a work of visual
elegance as well as sentiment. David Niven is an RAF squadron leader,
trapped in a burning plane over the English Channel, who bids
farewell to American WAC wireless operator Kim Hunter and bales
out--only to wash ashore moments later as she's passing by on her
bike. But has Niven truly survived, or is he just on a brief
reprieve? Can he appeal his death sentence? Or is he merely
hallucinating his subsequent experiences?</TE>
<TE>   "Stairway to Heaven" is a particular triumph for production
designer Alfred Junge's imagination, and his Other World is vast,
starkly simple and not all that different from the underworld in
Fritz Lang's "Metropolis." (It's Heaven, for example, that's in black
and white, and Earth in color.) It is a wonderfully romantic work, a
celebration of the preciousness of life in the immediate aftermath of
war. With Roger Livesey, Raymond Massey, Marius Goring and Abraham
Sofaer.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Narcissus" (1947), which follows, is unimaginable without
its lush color. Based on a Rumer Godden novel, it verges on the
outrageous in its evocation of incipient corruption and sexual
hysteria. Headed by Deborah Kerr, a group of nuns attempts to turn an
ancient Indian harem pitched on an incredibly high cliff into a
convent. The atmosphere, heady as the "black narcissus" perfume on a
scarf belonging to the bejeweled scion (Sabu) of the region's ruling
family, threatens to undermine the good sisters' resolve. Not helping
their situation is the irreverent, virile presence on an Englishman
(David Farrar) in the employ of Sabu's father.</TE>
<TE>   For their impressive, though obviously artificial efforts in
creating this seductive Shangri-La, production designer Alfred Junge
and still-active cinematographer Jack Cardiff both won Oscars. A cult
favorite, but a bit much, to put it mildly.</TE>
<TE>   Timelessly provocative, disturbing and original, Powell made,
without Pressburger, the 1959 "Peeping Tom" (Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.),
which opened to such ferocious London reviews it all but destroyed
his career. Thanks to the efforts of Martin Scorsese, it finally hit
local screens in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Daringly, Powell forces viewers to identify with a psychopathic
killer just as it is making us unpleasantly aware of our own
voyeurism--and in the process making clear the forces that twisted
him so.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's use of the camera is so accomplished that the film is
breathtaking. Alas, in its elegance of style and theatricality of its
acting it was at jarring odds with the gritty realism of the angry
working-class movies coming into fashion in the British cinema at the
time of its release.</TE>

<TE>   The UCLA Film Archive's The Golden Age of Mauritz Stiller
continues Saturday at 7:30 p.m. at the Melnitz Theater's James
Bridges Theater with "Erotikon" (1920). No wonder Ernst Lubitsch
acknowledged his debt to Stiller for his famous "Lubitsch touch." The
lavish, large-scale "Erotikon" boasts one of the first aerial
sequences in films and a ballet, created specially for the picture,
performed at the Swedish Opera House before an audience of 800.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it is an exceedingly sly and witty high-society
comedy involving an absent-minded professor (Anders de Wahl), his
bored, elegant wife (Tora Teje) and her very serious young suitor
(Lars Hanson, who was to appear with Lillian Gish in Victor
Sjostrom's 1926 "The Scarlet Letter" and 1928 "The Wind,"
two of Gish's finest films.</TE>
<TE>   A sequel to "Thomas Graal's Best Film," which screened last
Saturday, "Thomas Graal's Best Child" (1918) screens after
"Erotikon." It opens with a popular Swedish screenwriter (played by
Victor Sjostrom) marrying his secretary (Karin Molander)
only to quarrel immediately with her over what the sex of their first
child should be.</TE>
<TE>   The series closes Sunday at 7 p.m. with "The Atonement of Gosta
Berling" (1923-24), which is being presented in a three-hour restored
version that is the closest extant to its original four-hour form.
Made as two feature-length films, it was cut to one when it met with
sharply negative critical reception.</TE>
<TE>   Adapted from a Selma Lagerlof novel, it stars Lars Hanson as a
defrocked priest caught in a series of romances yet searching for
redemption. One of the women who catches the ex-priest's eye is a
radiant countess, played by 19-year-old Greta Garbo in her feature
debut. So impressed was Louis B. Mayer that he brought Stiller, who
insisted his protegee also be given a contract, to Hollywood, where
her success was as meteoric as his failure was abysmal. (Mayer's
daughter Irene Mayer Selznick, however, recalled that it was Garbo
whom her father was "hell-bent" on signing, with Garbo insistent that
her mentor be placed under contract.)</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Sweden broken and in ill health after two compromised
Hollywood productions, Stiller died in 1928. He was only 45. (310)
206-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Even though "King Rikki," which opens a one-week run Friday at the
downtown L.A. Grande, has been adapted from Shakespeare's "Richard
III," it is a routine sex-and-violence gang warfare tale set in East
L.A., with Jon Seda in the title role and the equally charismatic
Mario Lopez as the cop who thinks he can bring down the ruthless
Rikki.</TE>
<TE>   "Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky," not to be confused with the above,
is a primitive 1993 prison movie based on a cartoon and starring
muscular Fan Siu Wong as a martial arts whiz of superhuman strength
convicted of manslaughter for having avenged his girlfriend's death.</TE>
<TE>   The plot is just an excuse for one scene of blood-and-guts
ultra-violence that is said to have made the film a cult classic. It
screens, appropriately, Friday only at midnight at the Nuart. (310)
478-6379.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Film Archive is presenting in Melnitz Hall's James
Bridges Theater, Tuesday through May 19, "Anne-Marie Mieville," a
series of films made by Jean-Luc Godard's longtime associate.
"Reaching an Understanding," which opens the series Tuesday at 7:30
p.m., finds two women and two men, a quartet of sophisticated
intellectuals, most likely in Geneva, going about their daily lives.
But instead of conversing with each other in ordinary fashion, they
hold forth in an extended philosophical debate about the challenging
relationships between love, happiness and mortality. Meanwhile, the
two women (Mieville, Claude Perron) gravitate toward the two men
(Godard, Jacques Spiesser), respectively. "Reaching an Understanding"
is elegant, dryly witty, but while its nonstop debating may be on a
stratospheric level, it is also undeniably tedious.</TE>
<TE>   Mieville seems to be questioning the limitations of language while
suggesting it's all we have to work with. (310) 206-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Joe and Harry Gantz's documentary "Sex With Strangers," which has
already aired on the Showtime premium cable network, opens a one-week
run Friday at the Nuart. The Gantz brothers followed three swinging
couples for an entire year to explore the effects of open
relationships on their marriages.</TE>
<TE>   The results are illuminating but hardly surprising: Swinging can
sometimes strengthen marriages for those couples mature enough to
meet the challenge of balancing multiple sex partners with their
emotional commitments; others meet devastation beyond what they are
prepared for. Clearly, the brothers won their subjects' trust, and
though candid they are not exploitative. Best left, however, to those
interested in the subject matter. (310) 478-6379.</TE>

<HD>Lives of Trailer Park Dreamers</HD>
<DH>'Mule Skinner Blues' is an affectionate documentary about a
free-spirited group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago New York filmmaker Stephen Earnhart went to
Jacksonville, Fla., to shoot a music video with recording artist Jim
White in which a number of residents of a nearby trailer park worked
as extras. Among them was Beanie Andrew, an irrepressible 70-ish man
who has a lawn service and a love of singing and dancing
country-western style. He also confessed to a 60-year dream of
starring in a movie in which he would emerge from a muddy swamp in a
gorilla suit. Andrew persuaded Earnhart to help him realize his
dream--in a 15-minute short--if the filmmaker was allowed to film
Beanie and his friends and their lives.</LD>
<LD>   The result, Earnhart's debut documentary feature, is the
irresistible "Mule Skinner Blues," which the American Cinematheque
will screen at the Spielberg Theater at the Egyptian tonight through
Sunday, with Earnhart scheduled to attend all screenings. It will
resume without Earnhart, Wednesday through May 12. All screenings
will be at 7:30 p.m. and again at 9:30 p.m. except Sundays, when it
screens at 5 p.m. only.</LD>
<TE>   What's most important about "Mule Skinner Blues," which is about
the value of dreams, is that as amusing as it often is, it is even
more affectionate. Earnhart rightly does not view Beanie, his friends
and neighbors as trailer trash, nor even as bizarre eccentrics, but
as free-spirited individuals who display considerable talent and the
courage to be themselves. They are creative individuals who have yet
to win the recognition they crave but haven't given up, although
several of them also exhibit self-destructive streaks in the form of
alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   Beanie's long-term friend Larry Parrot, a lifelong horror fan who
writes spooky short stories for his own pleasure and runs a cleaning
service with his wife, comes up with a script, called "Turnabout Is
Fair Play," which will work in Andrew's long-dreamed-of moment. Other
participants will include Jeannie Holliman, a vivacious, 70-year-old
country-and-western singer and songwriter; Ricky Lix, a hard-driving
rock guitarist; and Steve Walker, a singer-guitarist songwriter with
his own band, of which Lix is a member. Also on hand is Annabelle Lea
Usher, a reflective woman whose dream was to become a costume
designer and who serves as the film's most articulate commentator on
creative drives and artistic impulses.</TE>
<TE>   The one among them who lives closest to the edge is definitely
Walker, a craggily handsome but ravaged-looking middle-aged man, a
traumatized Vietnam vet and survivor of five failed marriages who is
also a welder. By his own admission he hasn't been legally sober for
30 years; it's amazing that he's as functional as he is. "I want to
find a woman who is able to take me as I am," he says, "a drunk with
a future."</TE>
<TE>   After telling the stories of these people Earnhart jumps ahead
three years to 2000, to catch up with them and to show us "Turnabout
Is Fair Play" in the context of a gala local premiere. Some of what
has happened to the participants in the interim is positive, showing
human resilience, and some of it is poignant. "Mule Skinner Blues"
leaves us with a fresh awareness of just how much life can change in
a mere 1,000 days.</TE>

<HD>'District' Hands Plot to 'Agency'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You know a murder case is going to be tough when it takes the
investigative resources of two TV shows to crack it, and tonight at
10 on CBS, "The Agency" takes up where "The District" left off in the
conclusion of a two-part network "crossover."</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, a CIA agent's murder in Washington forced the "The
District's" gruff police chief, Jack Mannion (Craig T. Nelson), and
his minions to play host to CIA Director Tom Gage (Beau Bridges) and
his "Agency" agents. The inevitable clash of heads led to dialogue
such as, "Jack, I'm not the enemy. I'm here to help you!"</LD>
<LD>   But as the case jumps shows, it also grows darker, with evidence
of secret funds and blackmail adding to implications of CIA
involvement in the murder and a subsequent cover-up. Mannion begins
wondering just how far up the CIA's orders are coming from, and
whether the reptilian Homeland Security Liaison Robert Quinn (Daniel
Benzali) has a green light to orchestrate the whole thing.</LD>
<TE>   Viewers, however, may be most engrossed by a harrowing segment
involving a family under CIA protection whose identity has been
compromised and must be relocated. But first, Agent Terri Lowell
(Paige Turco) must find a way to help the family escape at nightfall
from a pitch-black house with the unseen enemy lurking outside.</TE>
<TE>   This subplot should have crossed over to next week's "Fear
Factor."</TE>

<HD>Classical and Casual Fridays</HD>
<DH>In an attempt to broaden its audience, the L.A.
Philharmonic dresses down. But can it overcome young people's
perception that it's boring?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ADAM BREGMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In my early 20s, I became a big Esa-Pekka Salonen fan.</LD>
<LD>   I often shelled out the bucks to watch his magical baton work in
front of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and dragged my friends along. I
was entranced. They were bored. They skipped out at intermission or,
worse, between movements. No one ever came along twice.</LD>
<LD>   So I understand why the Philharmonic people have arrived at the
point of Casual Friday. It's a fun, even mildly radical, idea. One by
one, they're trying to remove the hurdles between young people and
orchestral music. First to go, the dressy clothes. For these shows,
they invite the audience and the orchestra to arrive in their rumpled
finest. The third casual program of the season is Friday, featuring
Mahler's Symphony No. 1.</LD>
<TE>   The Philharmonic's second Casual Friday in January featured
Salonen sporting jeans and a T-shirt, the orchestra in khaki pants
and various anti-fashion ensembles and the crowd not sure how to
dress but stuck somewhere between dressy and running shoes.</TE>
<TE>   For the main performance, the orchestra appeared onstage in street
clothes. Bass clarinet player David Howard explained in a humorous
and very casual introduction that no tank tops, shorts or white
sneakers were allowed, but otherwise the musicians could dress as
they liked. In their regular clothes (baggy, beige khaki pants, a big
yellow shirt, a purple striped sweater), the orchestra resembled a
nerdy Caltech party. Howard also mentioned that the maestro was not
amused by cell phones, which drew some applause. This was just as a
phone went off behind me and the woman answered the call. Then
Salonen strutted onto the stage with his princely gait but no tails.</TE>
<TE>   The second--and perhaps more telling--change to the concert? No
intermission. Don't need one when the program is only slightly longer
than a B movie. January's concert was a very palatable 70 minutes
featuring Shostakovich's Symphony No. 1 and Scriabin's "Prometheus"
with a Pink-Floyd-at-the-Observatory-style laser-light show by
Laserium.</TE>
<TE>   The laser-light show, however, didn't lure the rock concert crowd.
At a pre-concert event hosted by author Sandra Tsing Loh, I detected
the usual Philharmonic crowd: women in fake furs followed by wafting
clouds of perfume and their husbands in blazers or sweaters trying to
stay awake. Halfway through the performance, I spotted some younger
couples drifting in--still mostly white and Asian--and what looked
like a school group of 20 teenagers. Minorities and young people are
still a small portion of the Philharmonic audience.</TE>
<TE>   During the Shostakovich, I did notice a long-haired Yngwie
Malmsteen-looking fellow sitting near me and thought that this is
exactly the sort of audience the Philharmonic wants to bring in. I
imagined that this dude was probably a guitarist who took music
seriously and that there were probably plenty like him who, for
whatever reason (maybe they couldn't find anyone to go with them),
had never had the pleasure of experiencing the L.A. Philharmonic.</TE>
<TE>   Salonen introduced the Scriabin piece with a couple of
incomprehensible jokes and his customary pretentious charm. (It's OK
to be pretentious when you're as talented as Salonen. Otherwise, it's
not OK.) The accompanying light show had a sort of "Fantasia"-type
effect and added to the hypnotic aspects of Scriabin's music. The
10-year-old next to me was sound asleep through the whole thing;
fortunately for them, he's not in the age group the Philharmonic
wishes to attract.</TE>
<TE>   After the concert, some audience members went to Otto's Grill, a
restaurant on the lower level of the Music Center, to have drinks
with a few musicians from the orchestra. Here, the crowd was a bit
younger, but most of the audience headed home at 9:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Challenge of Attracting Younger Audience</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's going to be difficult for the Philharmonic to
attract younger folk. Short-attention-span concerts and Dockers
attire may not do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   Other possible gimmicks might include orchestral arrangements of
Metallica standards, a free soda or ladies' night.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps fancy-looking rave-style fliers (which always seem to draw
a crowd) might bring in some confused Day-Glo people.</TE>
<TE>   None of that, however, cures the bottom-line wallet problem.
Decent seats at a Philharmonic concert are too pricey for most
twentysomethings working their first 9-to-5 job. Students can line up
an hour or two before the show for a limited number of cheaper "rush"
seats. (Now they're $10, which isn't bad. Several years ago they were
a great bargain at $5.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, it'll be a battle. With music programs cut back in high
schools, too many students have little or no knowledge of classical
music. And there's the widespread perception that I encountered among
the friends I lured to performances that classical concerts are
boring. But Salonen has plenty of rock star appeal. And though
there's no mosh pit--at least not yet--the orchestra proved on Casual
Friday that they can mix it up a little.</TE>
<TE>   Casual Fridays with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Friday at 8 p.m.
at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A.
Mahler's Symphony No. 1. $12 to $78. (323) 850-2000.</TE>

<HD>Cast, Crowe Revisit 'Jerry Maguire'</HD>
<DH>The DVD includes commentary from what the director calls 'a
sweet reunion' of the stars.</DH>

<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cameron Crowe is very apologetic that the initial DVD of his 2000
Oscar-winning "Almost Famous" was released in the spring of 2001
without his commentary. He wanted to do it but found that his hectic
schedule got in the way.</LD>
<LD>   "The one time in my life I actually try to be prolific," he says,
"it keeps me from working on the thing that I really wanted to--work
on the DVDs. But we did two movies ["Almost Famous" and "Vanilla
Sky"] back to back. I couldn't finish the DVD until we finished the
last movie."</LD>
<LD>   With "Vanilla Sky" completed, Crowe was able to work on the
digital versions of his films. Last fall, DreamWorks released a
two-disc edition of "Almost Famous" that includes Crowe and his
mother providing funny commentary on the semiautobiographical
comedy-drama. Earlier this year, Fox released an equally impressive
DVD of Crowe's 1989 movie "Say Anything." This time, Crowe and the
film's stars, John Cusack and Ione Skye, supplied the informative
commentary. (In a DVD first, the three discuss "Say Anything,"
Crowe's directorial debut, for 25 minutes before the film begins.)</LD>
<TE>   On May 21, Paramount will release the DVD of "Vanilla Sky," in
which Crowe offers commentary with his wife, composer Nancy Wilson,
accompanying on the guitar. But this week, Columbia TriStar is
releasing a two-disc special edition of Crowe's 1996 blockbuster,
"Jerry Maguire" ($28). It features a documentary, rehearsal footage,
deleted scenes and audio and video commentary with Crowe and stars
Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger and Cuba Gooding Jr. Gooding won a
supporting actor Oscar for his performance.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe says that none of the studios has ever suggested what he
should include on the DVDs. "We sort of come to them," he says.
"There is a guy in our office called Scott Martin. We are both real
music heads, and we both are fans of liner notes. I will rush out and
buy a box set that I have all the music of just to read the liner
notes. So we kind of approach all the DVDs as liner notes--a personal
conversation with somebody who would hopefully be a fan of the
movie."</TE>
<TE>   He decided it would be great if a camera could film the commentary
for "Jerry Maguire." "Everybody was so close to those characters in
real life," Crowe says. "So the feeling was, 'Let's have a reunion.'
Then it was, 'I would love to see what that looked like.' I had never
seen anybody do a video audio commentary. What you see is kind of
like a sweet reunion."</TE>
<TE>   The DVD marks the first time Cruise has participated in a
commentary. Crowe says the actor agreed to do it because of his love
of the film, for which he received an Oscar nomination.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the movie sort of inspired a lot of changes in all of our
lives," Crowe says. "It was a great time, and we really did get
along. But you know what the sparkplug was? Renee. We always missed
Renee because Renee went right into another movie after 'Jerry
Maguire.' She was never a part of any of our field trips to go to the
Oscars or junkets. I knew that Renee actually being with us would
give us some kind of booster rocket, and it did."</TE>
<TE>   Crowe, who wrote "Conversations With Wilder," a book of interviews
with Billy Wilder, says that "Jerry Maguire" was a tribute to the
late director. "It began wanting to inspire that kind of portrait of
modern man with hilarity and melancholy, and there is no greater
movie at that than 'The Apartment.'"</TE>
<TE>   He had wanted Wilder to play the part of the old sports agent in
"Jerry Maguire." Initially, Wilder told him he might be interested.
But when rehearsals began and Crowe contacted him again, "he said he
didn't remember me and 'leave an old man alone.'"</TE>
<TE>   But "Maguire" co-star Bonnie Hunt told Crowe not to take "no" for
an answer. "She said, 'You should get in your car and go right over
to his office.' Tom Cruise said, 'I'll go with you.' So we sped over
to his office and he spent 45 minutes telling us 'no' with glee and
loving it. It was an amazing afternoon. When the movie came out,
Billy Wilder called me up and said, 'I enjoyed the picture and I like
the guy who played my part, so if you'd like to come over and talk
about something for your column sometime.' ... I said, 'I don't have
a column but I'm coming over,' and that was the beginning of the
book."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The press release for the DVD of "Not Another Teen Movie"
(Columbia TriStar, $28) states that the 2001 flick is "a riotously
risque comedy." What it really is, is a gross-out, unfunny spoof of
teen movies from "The Breakfast Club" to "She's All That." Directed
by Joel Gallen, who produces the always entertaining MTV Movie
Awards, "Not Another Teen Movie" is strictly for undiscerning teenage
boys.</TE>
<TE>   The "special edition" DVD goes overboard with the extras,
including several behind-the-scenes featurettes, 18 deleted scenes,
auditions, trailers, an unrated version of Marilyn Manson's "Tainted
Love" music video, Gallen's first short film and commentaries from
the filmmakers and cast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Written and directed by Thomas Bezucha, "Big Eden" (Wolfe Video,
$25) is a sweet, old-fashioned romantic fable starring Arye Gross as
a gay New York painter who returns to his hometown of Big Eden,
Mont., when his grandfather (George Coe) suffers a stroke. A real
loner, he still is passionately and secretly in love with his boyhood
friend (Tim DeKay), a straight man and father of two.</TE>
<TE>   Initially afraid to tell his friends and family he's gay, he
quickly learns that not only are they accepting of his homosexuality,
they want him to be happy. So the town tries to set him up with Pike
(Eric Schweig), a shy, gay Native American who operates the general
store. Louise Fletcher and Nan Martin also star.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set includes a wide-screen version of the film,
generous commentary from the director, several behind-the-scenes
documentaries, deleted footage with commentary from the director and
even a list of the recipes for the meals Pike cooks in the film.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-four years after its release, George Romero's cannibalistic
zombie thriller "Night of the Living Dead" still packs a wallop of
terror. Elite Entertainment recently released a special two-disc DVD
edition of the 1968 indie hit ($25). Fans of the film will no doubt
gobble it up. Included is a beautiful new transfer of the
black-and-white film, trailers and TV spots, a not-so-funny film
parody called "Night of the Living Bread," a photo gallery, a history
of Romero's company, Latent Image, scenes from Romero's lost film
"There's Always Vanilla," an interview with star Judy Ridley, the
late star Duane Jones' final interview, posters, commentary with
Romero and members of the production crew and another commentary
track with the stars. One interesting note: The cemetery used in the
film's opening was later struck by a tornado and more than 200 bodies
were unearthed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For five years, Resfest has been a leading international digital
film festival. It travels to 14 cities on five continents, including
New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seoul and Cape Town. Palm
Pictures is releasing "The Best of the Resfest Volume I," a digital
collection of 16 of the festival's most acclaimed films. Each short
film includes director's commentary and information about the film.
Among the best films are "Pasta for War," a spoof of wartime
propaganda films featuring marching rigatoni, and "A Portrait of
Harry," a sweet snapshot of an 88-year-old ukulele player.</TE>

<DH>Boots Riley of the rap group the Coup lashes out against
the war in Afghanistan and the corporate co-opting of hip-hop music.</DH>

<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time, not so long ago, when hip-hop mattered. Artists
such as Public Enemy, KRS-One and Disposable Heroes of Hiphopricy
created vital music of urban rebellion, brash and lewd but also
pointedly insurrectionary. By the late '90s, politically charged
hip-hop had receded into a cartoon version of social protest, and the
music was co-opted by white suburban America as a soundtrack to
nothing in particular.</LD>
<LD>   Boots Riley fondly remembers that halcyon era, but he refuses to
look back for too long. "When we were doing shows in the mid-'90s,
the audiences were 95% black," says Riley, the leader of
Oakland-based rap duo the Coup, which also features female DJ Pam
(original member E-Rox left in 1998). "What's happened now is the
gentrification of hip-hop. A lot of cities passed ordinances that
made it hard for black audiences to gather in large groups. Clubs are
more open to hip-hop now 'cause it's the same crowd that goes to rock
shows."</LD>
<LD>   Wanting to Sell Records, but Not Sell Out</LD>
<TE>   Riley, 30, thinks a lot about such things. As the frontman for the
most confrontational rap group in America, the rapper is caught in a
vexing bind. He wants his band to sell a lot of records, but the will
to compromise just isn't there. The Coup's latest album, "Party
Music," on the Ark 75 label, is a sharp stab at the solar plexus, an
articulate manifesto for social revolution that implores its
listeners to think hard about forces--corrupt cops, on-the-take
politicians, fat-cat CEOs--that control their lives.</TE>
<TE>   An advocate of socialism, Riley is arguably the most outspoken
social critic in contemporary music, and while the Coup hasn't caught
fire commercially ("Party Music" is at the modest 15,000 figure),
word is spreading--the album finished at No. 8 in the Village Voice
critics' poll of the best records of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Every night on this tour, I say something against the war" in
Afghanistan, says Riley, whose group appears with X-ecutioners on
Monday at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and Tuesday at the
Glass House in Pomona. "Last night, this guy in a Harley-Davidson
T-shirt started cursing at me. After the show, he came up to me and
told me that he had thought about what he had done, and that perhaps
I was right. That's cool, ya know? It's not like our shows are filled
with people who have little red stars on their hats."</TE>
<TE>   Riley is deeply disturbed by the corporate co-opting of hip-hop,
and by the record business' aggressive efforts to woo white
consumers. He still can't quite reconcile himself to the fact that
the current tour is sponsored by the health-beverage company SoBe.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, when we were in Tallahassee, [SoBe representatives] went
down to Florida State, which is primarily white, and gave away free
tickets," says Riley. "But there was a black university much closer
to the venue, and kids there didn't even know about it.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people out there dedicated to changing the core
demographic of this music. For our last album, we were getting played
in three major markets, and we had the No. 2 video on BET, but we
couldn't get shows. Every time a club would book us, the police would
come and say we were drawing the wrong crowd."</TE>
<TE>   Despite 10 years of anti-establishment protest, the Coup made
national headlines last year not for its music but for an eerily
prescient photograph. Just weeks before Sept. 11, it distributed
advance copies of "Party Music" to the media with a cover that
depicted the World Trade Center being blown up by a bomb. The cover
was later featured in a few national magazines, and a controversy was
hatched. Riley scrambled to come up with an alternative--a Molotov
cocktail in a martini glass--before the album's November release.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that ended up being cool, in the sense that a lot of
people and journalists who wouldn't have listened to the album before
now listened," says Riley. "It allowed me to get some views against
the war out there that wouldn't have been there. I just chose a
symbol that had to do with corporations."</TE>
<TE>   Riley's urge to speak truth to power is bred in his bones. His
parents were social activists in Riley's native city of Detroit, and
he was involved in organizing long before he discovered rap. "My dad
was involved with the NAACP and the Progressive Labor Party," he
says. "I grew up around politics. I organized my first campaign when
I was 14, a walk-out in my high school to protest the year-round
school schedule."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Riley became involved in rap, he felt like "a
burned-out organizer." Emboldened by the Schoolly D and Run-DMC
records he was exposed to, Riley began to rap at talent shows and
formed the Coup in 1991 with DJ Pam. "I only thought that change
could come through organized protest," says Riley. "I never connected
the two parts of my life until later on."</TE>
<TE>   But Riley has not forsaken activism for music. A few years ago, he
took a hiatus from hip-hop to work with his organization the Young
Comrades, a group that conducted campaigns against various racially
divisive issues in Oakland. "I just look at music as a retreat from
organizing," says Riley. "It's like a tug-of-war with me. Music can
be effective, but it's not any good if there isn't a grass-roots
movement going on to support it."</TE>

<LD>Ventura Chamber Music Festival's history has been one of notable
planning and general artistic success. Every spring for the past
eight years, the festival has ushered renowned and inspired musicians
to town. It creates an aura of cultured activity at various sites,
with food ever on the periphery. In short, the festival threatens to
become a major West Coast classical event, if it hasn't already.</LD>
<LD>   With this year's 10-day program, dubbed "Mozart in Ventura," the
festival rises a few notches with the arrival of one of the towering
pianists of the day, Alicia de Larrocha. The famed Spanish pianist,
who made her American debut in Los Angeles in 1955, is the clear
highlight of the festival. She'll perform a solo recital next
Thursday and with the Festival Chamber Orchestra May 11, both at
Ventura College Theater.</LD>
<LD>   This weekend's roster includes tonight's nonclassical kickoff,
when smooth-jazz veteran David Benoit concertizes at Livery Theatre
in a tribute to jazz piano great Bill Evans. The Rossetti String
Quartet, a hit at last year's fest, will play the first of two
concerts on Friday at the Community Presbyterian Church. Saturday
night, "Naked Opera" features singers from Los Angeles Opera up close
and personal at the First Baptist Church, and festival regular Corey
Cerovsek, a dazzling young violinist, gives a recital Wednesday at
Community Presbyterian.</LD>

<TE>   Music Appreciation: At Laurel Theater these days, the first and
nearly the last sounds we hear during the wonderful two-man play "Old
Wicked Songs" are those of the first and last songs in Schumann's
song cycle "Dichterliebe" (Poet's Love). In between, the play
continually writhes in and out of the score, which supplies musical
and poetic logic. Fittingly enough, the Ventura Chamber Music
Festival is associated with this production, directed with a sure
hand by Jenny Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Marans' engaging drama, which won approval in its New York run
in the mid-'90s and is slated for a film adaptation, makes for
captivating theater in its current Rubicon Theater Co. production. A
tale of an elderly Viennese music teacher (Harold Gould) and a
reluctant, cynical American student, Stephen (Joseph Fuqua), the play
builds its tension on the themes of youthful restlessness versus the
gentle irony and wisdom of age, of pragmatism versus intuition in
art, and finally, of the legacy of anti-Semitism.</TE>
<TE>   The play's charm, as well as its notes of rage and poignancy, have
been duly noted, but not enough has been made of the ingenious scheme
by which Marans allows Schumann's musical motif to run through it. An
intense emotional focus is brought about by the drama's unfolding
over several lessons on a single set, a Viennese studio with Klimt
posters and calmly ornate wallpaper.</TE>
<TE>   In another way, the fixed gaze on the words, notes and ambivalent
emotions contained in "Dichterliebe" gives the play much of its
strength. Marans was a music student in Vienna and chose to revisit
that experience, as well as the hauntingly beautiful Schumann cycle
with his play. One recurring point of reference is the song called
"Ich grolle nicht" ("I bear no grudge, and when my heart is breaking
..."). It cleverly switches from a bitter love lament to a statement
of indignation over the Holocaust, after the young man returns from a
trip to Dachau.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, what also counts is the bold chemistry of its players:
Gould is a commanding presence, and Fuqua is the flexible foil.</TE>
<TE>   * "Old Wicked Songs," Rubicon Theatre Co., 1006 E. Main St.,
Ventura. Wednesdays to Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 2
p.m. Ends May 19. $28 to $33. (805) 667-2900.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Simon Time: The Neil Simon staple of comic theater "Plaza Suite"
has settled into Ventura County at the Backlot Theater in Thousand
Oaks. The 1969 play, made into a film with Walter Matthau and Maureen
Stapleton in 1971, deals with the lives and strivings of three
couples passing through a suite in New York's Plaza Hotel. The
Vagabond Players, responsible for last year's production of the
original play "L'Chaim," are presenting the play, with a cast
including Ronald Rezac, Gail James, Martin Horsey and Denice
Stradling. Direction by Don Pearlman.</TE>
<TE>   * "Plaza Suite," Backlot Theater, 1408 Thousand Oaks Blvd.,
Thousand Oaks. Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends
May 12. $14, adults; $12, seniors and students. (805) 987-6039.</TE>

<TE>   When Spain was the colonial power in Peru, the African slaves
weren't allowed to own drums, so wooden crates and donkey jaws became
percussive musical instruments. Despite a long history, the African
influence on Peruvian music has only recently begun to get any
attention. The 30-year-old group Peru Negro, for instance, is only
now making its U.S. debut, and it has released its first
international record, "Sangre de un Don." In concert at Royce Hall,
expect a percussive backbone to melodic guitar and vocals.</TE>

<LD>Re "Residents Fight a Flood of Commuters," April 28: It is not just
the residents of Encino who are complaining; all communities along
the Ventura Boulevard corridor from Studio City to Woodland Hills
have this problem. I see it every day. Instead of having
traffic-calming measures for just Encino, why not include all the
communities along the Ventura Boulevard corridor in the study?</LD>
<LD>   I can tell you that these other communities have the same problem.
The Transportation Department should include all these other
communities in the study if the results are to be effective. Perhaps
if more communities were involved it would help prevent the problem
from being pushed on to the other communities.</LD>
<LD>   Christopher Carroll</LD>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have been an Encino resident for 24 years. Our hillside
neighborhood has not changed in population but has been changed by
development to the north and west--and 10 schools immediately to the
south. When an infrastructure (roads) is not included to support the
development, the result is the traffic mess we have in the Encino
hillside area. Quality-of-life issues, safety issues and health
issues (pollution) were not addressed in the article. The Department
of Transportation plan should be supported by all Encino residents
who care about their community.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Kelson</TE>
<TE>   Encino</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I sympathize with the Encino hills residents' frustration with
rush-hour commuters flooding their narrow streets and am appalled
that nearby residents (who don't live in the hills) are labeling
these people as elitists simply because they want to keep their
streets safe and congestion-free. Is it elitist to want an area not
designed for excessive traffic to remain safe from belligerent and
reckless commuters? Residents pay a great deal of money to live in
this area because it offers more privacy and peace. Selfish commuters
should be respectful of this and take routes designed for heavy
traffic flow. And if it makes their commutes longer? Deal with it, or
move closer.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Hopkins</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A suggestion: How about imposing speed limits on the residential
streets that are consistent with safety and then using the police to
enforce the traffic laws? Nonenforcement of the laws on Southern
California roadways, a chronic embarrassment during the 14 years that
I have lived here, has rooted in a generation of youth who have never
seen anything but random and incidental enforcement of traffic rules.
Following the rules now creates chaos and singles one out for
punishment by the generally lawless public. In Encino there are
plenty of people willing and able to pay the salaries of more traffic
cops.</TE>
<TE>   And for those of us who commute by bicycle? Don't go there! Oy!</TE>

<HD>Identity-Theft Ring Broken Up in Irvine</HD>
<DH>Crime: Law enforcement officials say the public can expect
even more sophisticated scams.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal and local law enforcement officials say they have broken up
one of the Southland's biggest identity-theft rings--a gang that
mined the Internet for details about victims and recruited
accomplices among losing gamblers to drain bank accounts and run up
fraudulent credit card bills.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation, which is expected to be announced today by
Irvine police, included a December raid on the ringleader's apartment
that uncovered a high-tech identity-production line, including
computers, scanners, printers and machines to produce bogus checks
and credit cards.</LD>
<LD>   "It was the most sophisticated, cleanest operation" Irvine
authorities had ever seen, said Damon Tucker, an investigator with
the Irvine Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   And investigators say they are working on cases involving even
more sophisticated identity-theft rings, including one that paid off
a bank insider to provide data such as mothers' maiden names on
hundreds of bank customers and then used the information to set up
online accounts designed to conduct fraudulent wire transfers of
funds.</TE>
<TE>   Identity theft has become the biggest source of consumer fraud
complaints logged by the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC recorded
86,000 complaints last year--42% of all fraud complaints it received,
with Internet auction scams a distant second at 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Identity thieves use personal information to assume someone's
identity and then loot their bank accounts, run up credit card
bills--even buy houses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's become enormously popular among criminals who used to commit
more violent crimes, like armed robbery or crimes where they had more
exposure, like organized shoplifting," said Joanna Crain, the FTC's
identity-theft program manager. "They've all concluded identity theft
is lower risk in terms of being detected and in terms of penalties if
they are caught."</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department has
received about 6,000 identity-theft complaints, said Jonathan
Fairlough, a high-tech and identity-theft prosecutor with the Los
Angeles district attorney's office. In Southern California, losses to
individuals in identity-theft cases usually run in the
$2,000-to-$3,000 range, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One headache has been a gang operating in the downtown L.A.,
Pasadena-Glendale and Long Beach areas that pays for stolen documents
with high-quality amphetamines, he said. In another case, a
ringleader who worked at a health insurance company stole the
identities of out-of-state doctors, using them to set up fake cell
phone accounts. He placed ads for nonexistent apartments, listing the
cell phone numbers as the contact. He collected deposits from
low-income renters and disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "When the complaints came in, we couldn't even identify them with
anyone living in California," Fairlough said. Losses in that scam
were in the $100,000 range--quite high by identity-theft standards,
although he's working another case in which stolen identities were
used to rent half a million dollars in commercial cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Losses are estimated at $500,000 in the Irvine case, which was
investigated by the FBI and the Secret Service as well as local
authorities. Ringleader Jeremy Cushing pleaded guilty Tuesday to 10
felony charges carrying a 10-year prison term, and several alleged
accomplices are in custody, said Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Mark Sevigny.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Cushing used lieutenants to recruit losing
gamblers and other people who were in financial trouble to act as
"mules," or runners. The runners would cash checks at banks using
phony IDs based on someone else's identity. The runners were given
personal information to memorize in case the teller became suspicious
and asked questions.</TE>
<TE>   If a teller called police, the lieutenant, watching outside the
bank, would simply flee. If the checks were cashed, the runner would
keep about a third of the money and Cushing's outfit would keep the
rest, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   But Cushing had other, more sophisticated scams, investigators
say. Phil Cadenhead, an economic crimes investigator for the Irvine
police, said that when a lucky break led them to the luxury apartment
Cushing had rented under a false name, "there was a ton of documents,
probably 20 boxes from various sources with names and every
imaginable kind of personal information."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI turned up more than $400,000 in losses at banks and
brokerage houses attributable to Cushing's operation, and the ring
also used stolen identities to purchase a $40,000 sports car,
high-end electronics gear and other items, Cadenhead said.</TE>
<TE>   By pretending to be a legitimate business, Cushing set up accounts
at several Internet database companies that provide personal
information to businesses and government agencies, investigators
said. Once Cushing was in the system, he could use a legitimate name
and Social Security number to get birth dates, address confirmations
and even criminal records, officials said--everything needed to take
on a false identity.</TE>

<HD>Talks to Settle Suit Against Enron, Others Fail</HD>
<DH>Courts: Mediation ends. The class action by investors and
workers is expected to proceed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talks to settle civil litigation against Enron Corp., its former
auditor Arthur Andersen and others involved in the Enron debacle
collapsed Wednesday, with the court-appointed mediator saying the
parties had reached an impasse.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Green, a Boston University law professor appointed March 22
to mediate the case, telephoned U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon in
Houston to say he was terminating his efforts. Green declined to make
a public statement.</LD>
<LD>   "The possibility of a settlement with Arthur Andersen presented
many complicated and interconnected issues that required the
agreement of numerous parties," said Trey Davis, spokesman for the
University of California Board of Regents, the lead plaintiff in the
class-action lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   "Despite our extensive efforts, in the end these simply could not
be worked out.</TE>
<TE>   "Without their resolution, any settlement would have worked to the
detriment of the class," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The talks were aimed at settling a class-action lawsuit in which
Enron investors and employees claimed they lost billions of dollars
in the Houston energy trader's collapse. The plaintiffs allege that
the company and its auditor misled investors by artificially
inflating profits through off-the-books partnerships and faulty
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   With mediation breaking down, the case is expected to move
forward, with depositions this summer of financiers and banks accused
of aiding efforts of Enron executives to conceal debt and inflate
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Although Andersen had agreed to put up $300 million to settle the
case, other issues blocked an agreement, according to people familiar
with the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   One of the chief stumbling blocks, according to one source, was
the insistence by creditors in Enron's bankruptcy on collecting $150
million of Andersen's settlement payment for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Other parties believed that reserving half of the cash was far too
generous considering the losses suffered by Enron's shareholders. A
source familiar with the talks said that a settlement might have been
reached if the financial creditors--mostly banks and investment
banks--had been willing to accept $40 million to $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Another complicating factor was that several of the financial
creditors provided investment banking and other services to Enron and
also are defendants in the class-action lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   That created a dispute over whether Andersen's offer of $300
million would have capped the amount the banks and investment banks
would have to pay to settle the class-action case. Attorneys
representing the shareholders wanted these other defendants to sign
waivers agreeing that Andersen's payment would not set a baseline for
their potential liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   A source familiar with the mediation effort said some of the banks
agreed to the waiver, but others refused.</TE>
<TE>   Green oversaw talks last year between federal prosecutors and
Microsoft Corp. that eventually led to a settlement of the Justice
Department's antitrust case against the software maker. Nine states
are still pursuing claims against the company.</TE>

<HD>Telecom Bonds Continue to Slide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Market prices of WorldCom Inc.'s actively traded bonds fell further
Wednesday, and investors' worries about the telecom industry dragged
rival AT&amp;T Corp.'s bonds down as well.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom's 8.25% bonds maturing in 2031 fell to a record low of
$41.16 per $100 face value, down from $43.71 on Tuesday and $55.31 a
week ago.</LD>
<LD>   The annualized current yield on those securities now is
20%--assuming WorldCom continues to pay interest at the 8.25% rate.</LD>
<TE>   AT&amp;T's 6.5% bonds maturing in 2029 slid to $71.90 per $100 face
value, down from $74.22 on Tuesday and $79.19 a week ago. That put
the current yield on the bonds at 9%.</TE>
<TE>   Another AT&amp;T issue, 8% bonds maturing in 2031, fell to $84.64,
pushing the current yield to about 9.5%.</TE>
<TE>   "AT&amp;T [bonds] had held up relatively well" until recent days, said
Patricia Lee, an analyst for fixed-income research service
CreditSights Inc. But with WorldCom's perceived problems, more
investors now "want to lighten telecom exposure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   AT&amp;T, the No. 1 U.S. long-distance telephone and cable television
company, last week posted a $975-million first-quarter net loss and
said revenue fell 11% amid stiff competition and reduced spending by
its customers.</TE>
<TE>   Although its bonds lost value Wednesday, AT&amp;T shares rose 84 cents
to $13.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Investors still snapped up a new securities offering from one
telecommunications firm, rural telephone service provider Alltel
Corp. The company sold $1billion in three-year securities that are
automatically convertible into company stock.</TE>

<HD>Consumers Give Auto Makers a Boost in April</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID RUNK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>U.S. vehicle sales increased 3.1% last month compared with April 2001
as improved economic conditions and incentives attracted buyers, auto
makers reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time this year that sales improved from the same
month a year earlier. With more than 5.3 million vehicles sold in the
first four months of 2002, industry sales are down just 1.7% from the
same period last year.</LD>
<LD>   "We're coming into a more powerful market than we've been looking
at," said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. "It's
another indication that the car market, and for that matter the
economy, is improving."</LD>
<TE>   In all, auto makers sold more than 1.4 million vehicles last
month, compared with more than 1.3 million in April 2001. Truck sales
rose 6% to more than 726,000, while car sales edged up 1% to come in
above 717,500.</TE>
<TE>   Led by surging truck sales, General Motors Corp. reported a 12.6%
sales increase in April from the same month a year ago. GM, the
world's largest auto maker, expects to maintain that momentum as the
year progresses.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of GM light trucks rose 24.3% compared with April 2001,
while car sales edged up 1.1%. For the year so far, GM's vehicle
sales are down 0.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other major U.S. auto makers, DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler
Group reported sales rose 3% in April compared with the same month
last year, while Ford Motor Co.'s sales were down 7.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler sold 3.8% more cars than it did in April 2001, and light
truck sales rose 2.7%. Chrysler's year-to-date sales are down 5.3%.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars were 13% lower than those
during April 2001, and light truck sales--including pickups, sport
utility vehicles, vans and minivans--fell 4.8%. For the first four
months of this year, Ford sold 11.7% fewer vehicles than in the same
period last year.</TE>
<TE>   Among the major Japanese auto makers, Toyota Motor Corp.'s sales
edged up 0.4%, while its totals for the first four months of the year
were 3.2% better than last year. Sales at Nissan Motor Corp. rose 15%
in April, while American Honda Motor Co. reported a 1.3% increase for
the month. Mitsubishi Motors Corp. reported selling 8.5% more
vehicles in April than it did in April 2001, boosted by a 16%
increase in car sales. It was the best April in the company's
history, Mitsubishi said, and its year-to-date sales are up more than
20%.</TE>
<TE>   Among European auto makers, BMW of North America reported sales
rose 15.3% compared with April 2001. Mercedes-Benz USA recorded its
best April with a 7.4% increase over April 2001.</TE>

<HD>Comcast Posts Quarterly Loss; Sales Increase 20%</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The cable-TV operator had a loss of $88.9 million
partly from costs to upgrade digital, Internet systems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Comcast Corp., the cable-television operator planning to buy AT&amp;T
Corp.'s cable unit, had an $88.9-million first-quarter loss, partly
due to costs to buy and upgrade systems for digital TV and Internet
service.</LD>
<LD>   Sales rose 20% to $2.67 billion, more than analysts expected, as
average monthly customer bills increased 8.5%.</LD>
<LD>   The first-quarter loss of 9 cents a share compared with net income
of $1 billion, or $1.04, a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   President Brian Roberts told investors in a conference call that
he'll boost sales at the third-largest U.S. cable-TV operator by
offering new services, including movies on demand, as growth of
basic-cable customers slows. More than half the quarter's 12% rise in
cable revenue to $1.47 billion came from digital cable, with more
channels and fast Web connections.</TE>
<TE>   "Data and digital will be the growth drivers of the company," said
Alan Muschott, a money manager at Franklin Advisors, which holds 1
million Comcast shares among the firm's $266 billion under
management. In the first quarter, selling those products "paid off
with better-than-expected growth."</TE>
<TE>   Comcast will meet the company's previous forecasts, including
cable unit revenue growth this year of as much as 12%, because it is
selling new products, Treasurer John Alchin said in a conference call
with analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast probably will announce agreements to show movies on demand
from certain studios, Roberts said. He declined to identify them.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Comcast's cable systems, the company owns stakes in
networks including the E! Networks, Golf Channel and Outdoor Life
Network.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast said in February it will spend $3.15 billion in 2001 and
2002 to maintain and upgrade systems for new products. Average
monthly bills increased to $40.10 from $36.95 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "The key here is to sell more products to the current subscriber
base," said David Baker, a money manager at North American Asset
Management.</TE>

<HD>PETA Claims 'Happy Cow' Ads Are Too Far Afield</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Melinda Fulmer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals filed a complaint Tuesday
with the Federal Trade Commission, alleging that the California Milk
Advisory Board engaged in deceptive advertising with its "Happy Cow"
commercials.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint says the idyllic commercials, which take place in
grassy pastures and end with the tag line "Great cheese comes from
happy cows. Happy cows come from California," provide a false picture
of California's more intense dairy production and thus mislead
consumers into buying a product they might not buy otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Animals on many of California's dairy farms are kept in dirt lots
and open sheds, rather than pastures and straw-carpeted barns, the
complaint says. And California farms have higher slaughter rates than
dairy herds in other states.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives of the milk advisory board say there are many
types of farms in California, including pasture operations like those
filmed for the ads.</TE>

<HD>10 Cable Firms Agree to Add HDTV by Jan. 1</HD>
<DH>Technology: The companies' pledge is the first major step
in the troubled transition to digital television.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tackling one of the thorniest problems facing a new generation of
broadcasting, the country's 10 largest cable television companies
pledged Wednesday to add high-definition digital TV to their line-ups
by next year.</LD>
<LD>   The cable companies, including AT&amp;T Broadband, AOL Time Warner
Inc. and Adelphia Communications Corp., didn't specify when they
would make HDTV available to their customers. But they committed to
offering free space in their channel lineups by Jan. 1 to as many as
five broadcasters or cable networks that air significant amounts of
HDTV.</LD>
<LD>   The pledge marks the first significant progress for the troubled
transition to digital TV, which the Federal Communications Commission
mandated in 1997. The switch from analog to digital promises clearer
pictures, better sound and more sophisticated services, but it forces
broadcasters to invest millions of dollars in new equipment and
consumers to buy digital TVs.</LD>
<TE>   Yet even Wednesday, cable operators were reluctant to set a date
for rolling out the services. And their commitment leaves several
disputes among the cable operators, set manufacturers and
broadcasters still to be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell praised the cable operators for
their "solid commitments," but broadcasters and set manufacturers
were more reserved. Concerned that the cable operators will continue
to refuse space for some local digital stations and certain types of
programming, Eddie Fritts, chief executive of the National Assn. of
Broadcasters, said, "We look forward to the day when cable operators
carry all digital broadcast signals in their entirety."</TE>
<TE>   Illustrating the slow progress of the transition, about 75% of the
nation's 1,300 commercial broadcasters missed the deadline Wednesday
for turning on their digital signals. Federal officials said they did
not plan to penalize those stations because they expect most to have
their digital signals on the air by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous problems have plagued the transition, including the high
price of digital sets and the shortage of unique digital programming.
Only a handful of over-the-air and cable networks offer HDTV, the
most richly detailed form of digital programming, and only the Public
Broadcasting Service has used the new technology to offer multiple
simultaneous programs.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest problem for broadcasters, though, is that
two-thirds of their viewers tune in through cable, and most cable
operators have refused to carry digital channels. Satellite operators
also have been reluctant to carry the local digital offerings, so the
only option for many consumers is to put up an antenna.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Powell tried to breathe life into the transition by
setting voluntary deadlines for cable and satellite operators,
broadcasters, programmers and set manufacturers. On Wednesday, Robert
Sachs, chief executive of the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications
Assn., said in a letter to Powell that the top 10 cable operators
would comply with most of the chairman's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In the 100 largest markets, high-capacity cable systems will offer
to carry up to five local stations or cable networks that provide
HDTV a substantial portion of the time, Sachs' letter states.</TE>
<TE>   The cable operators' commitment didn't meet Powell's proposal on
one point: They didn't agree to provide converter boxes with digital
connectors by Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Such devices, which consumers may need to tune in premium HDTV
programming from Hollywood studios, won't be widely available until
the end of 2003, Sachs said in his letter.</TE>
<TE>   Most cable networks across the country have been upgraded to
high-capacity systems, so the pledge could make HDTV available to
tens of millions of viewers. But offering to carry a digital station
isn't the same as putting that station in the lineup, as several
cable operators pointed out.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't mean that, for sure, on Jan. 1 [HDTV] will be
available," said Amy Cohn, a spokeswoman for Cox Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that a number of contractual and technical issues remain to
be resolved, Cohn said, "We will make a good-faith effort to try to
have programming available close to that date ... [but] we can't
commit to a definite launch."</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner is more gung-ho about the new technology. Company
officials said they already offer local digital stations and HDTV
versions of several cable networks throughout their territories. And
almost any customer who signs up for digital cable--the cable
industry's version of digital TV, which is not the same as the
broadcasters' new channels--can obtain a special converter box and
tune in HDTV.</TE>

<HD>Rift Opens Over U.S. Trade Deficit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said Wednesday that there is
little Washington can--or should--do about the export-damaging
strength of the U.S. dollar and the rapidly widening gap between how
much America imports and exports.</LD>
<LD>   But O'Neill's remarks to a congressional committee came amid a
growing consensus that the dollar's strength since the mid-1990s and
the resulting jump in the nation's current-account deficit--the
mismatch between its exports and the import of goods, services and
transfers--are substantial threats to the economy.</LD>
<LD>   Even as he spoke, however, the dollar continued its recent
pullback against key currencies, including the euro and the yen. That
shakiness--though barely denting the greenback's value so far--has
fueled worries that strength could abruptly turn to weakness, which
could send import prices surging and drive the nation back into
recession.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the single biggest risk to the U.S. economic outlook and
... the secretary of the Treasury certainly ought to be concerned
about it," veteran international economist C. Fred Bergsten told the
Senate Banking Committee after O'Neill spoke.</TE>
<TE>   On its face, O'Neill's testimony represented little more than a
restatement of long-held Bush administration policy that a strong
dollar is in the national interest.</TE>
<TE>   And O'Neill was almost certainly motivated by a desire to avoid
repeating a painful mistake early in his tenure, when an off-the-cuff
remark sent the dollar into a brief but sharp dive.</TE>
<TE>   But in his effort to drive home the message of "no change" on the
dollar, O'Neill inadvertently highlighted the depth of differences
between the administration and other policymakers both here and
abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized countries
recently warned that huge U.S. trade deficits threaten economic
recovery worldwide. Even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a
friend of O'Neill, cautioned against allowing the dollar to continue
strengthening and the deficit to grow.</TE>
<TE>   "Countries that have gone down this path invariably have run into
trouble," Greenspan told a congressional committee in March, "and so
would we."</TE>
<TE>   The current-account balance represents the broadest measure of
America's financial obligations to other countries. The gap between
inflows and outflows reached 4.1% of U.S. gross domestic product last
year and could hit 5% by the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   That would make it the largest mismatch in the industrialized
world--and one of the largest even among developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   But size alone is not what has analysts most worried. In effect,
some analysts say, the strong dollar and resulting outsized deficits
are similar to the now-ended dot-com and telecom bubbles--fun while
they lasted, but ultimately bad for the economy and difficult for
policymakers to handle.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the dot-com dollar," quipped James W. Paulsen, chief
investment officer with Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis.
"Policy officials--maybe not at Treasury, but certainly at the
Fed--would love to see the dollar weaken somewhat. But they're afraid
of doing anything for fear of popping the bubble."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, policymakers have already used several of the tools they
usually employ against a strong dollar and growing trade deficits--to
almost no effect.</TE>
<TE>   Moves to Lessen Increase Fall Short</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, they have sharply boosted the money supply and
slashed interest rates, moves that ordinarily make it less appealing
to hold dollars. But the greenback's value has continued to rise
during most of that time.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the recent modest decline in the dollar's value,
which amounts to about 3% against a basket of key currencies, has not
been enough to fundamentally alter the economic equation.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to currencies, it's a beauty contest among
countries," said Edwin M. Truman, a former senior Treasury and Fed
official.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, the U.S. looks pretty attractive. That doesn't mean it
will always be that way," he said. "But if you're an investor, what
looks more attractive right now?"</TE>
<TE>   In his testimony Wednesday, O'Neill suggested that current-account
statistics were outdated measures of the trade and financial
relations between nations, and he questioned whether the dollar's
strength has anything to do with the huge U.S. current-account
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury secretary said, for example, that the statistics were
premised on the notion that "the world is run on a nation-state basis
and that nations are basically independent of each other in an
economic sense."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't find that to be the way the world is anymore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But those who followed O'Neill at Wednesday's hearing adamantly
rejected his position, asserting that the trade statistics do
properly measure economic trends and that the dollar's strength is
the chief cause of the nation's current deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Since hitting record lows in 1995, the dollar has risen between
40% and 50% against other major currencies, according to Fed
statistics. That has caused the price of U.S.-made goods and services
sold abroad to rise commensurately.</TE>
<TE>   "When a company sees its prices go up 40% to 50% in a few years
against its main competition, it usually is in Chapter 11"
bankruptcy, said Bergsten, director of the Institute for
International Economics, a Washington research center.</TE>
<TE>   Bergsten and others at Wednesday's hearing laid part of the blame
for the strong dollar on O'Neill, charging that his public comments
have propped up a currency that would otherwise have slipped.</TE>
<TE>   "Treasury is part of the problem," said Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, a Washington trade
group whose members have been hurt by the dollar's strength.</TE>
<TE>   The trade gap, the excess of U.S. imports of goods and services
over exports that is the main component of the current-account
deficit, totaled $31.5 billion in February, up from $28.7 billion a
year ago February, according to Commerce Department statistics.</TE>

<HD>Factory Activity Index Slips in April</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing grew for a third straight month in April but at a
slower pace, an industry report said Wednesday, signaling that
economic growth has slowed and will keep the Federal Reserve from
raising interest rates soon.</LD>
<LD>   A drop in new orders held back the Institute for Supply
Management's monthly manufacturing index in April to 53.9, down from
55.6 in March. Any reading above 50 suggests growth in manufacturing.
"While the economy continues to recover, it's just not as robust a
pace of recovery as we saw in the first quarter," said Conrad
DeQuadros, economist at Bear Stearns.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, construction spending fell 0.9% in March to a
seasonally adjusted $874-billion annual rate, after a revised 0.7%
gain in February. Spending fell from its robust pace during the mild
winter in part because of a large drop in public construction
projects.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first drop in construction spending since September,
when hijacked airliners destroyed the World Trade Center and briefly
halted the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers reinforce the argument that the Fed would not move
[to raise rates] in the next two meetings" May 7 and in late June,
said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at Wells Capital Management
in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   After an 18-month slump that ended in a runoff of inventories left
over from boom times, factories are boosting output to meet a rise in
new orders. But firms have not recovered enough to raise employment
or capital spending--key to sustaining growth.</TE>

<HD>Euro Signals Global Transition</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES FLANIGAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent rise in the euro and fall in the dollar signal a decline
in global dependence on the U.S. economy, along with growing
determination that European economies are finally reforming and
moving out of their doldrums.</LD>
<LD>   Both developments suggest huge shifts in the world economic scene
and are likely to be positive for the U.S. economy. Reforms in Europe
also will revolutionize the staid European Union, which has tolerated
high 9% and 10% unemployment in Germany, France, Italy and other
major countries for years.</LD>
<LD>   The rise in the euro comes as European officials gather today in
Washington to discuss trade policies with the Bush administration.
The euro has risen against the dollar to more than 90 cents from
about 85 cents in the last month. This reflects a decline in foreign
investment in U.S. government and corporate securities, as investors
have diversified into the euro, says Scott Weiner, managing principal
of Payden &amp; Rygel, a Los Angeles investment firm with operations in
Europe.</LD>
<TE>   The dollar's decline reflects an emerging view of the U.S.
economy, which has been the world's almost only growth engine for
much of the last decade. The U.S. took in imports from all countries,
running trade deficits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. But
the exporting countries, seeing few prospects in their own economies,
turned around and invested those dollars back into U.S. government
and corporate securities and in acquiring U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   That inflow of capital, which ran to more than $700 billion a year
in the late '90s, held down U.S. interest rates and pushed up stock
and bond prices and real estate values. It also led to a U.S. trade
and current-account deficit of more than $400 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   But now, with U.S. economic growth uncertain and the U.S. stock
market clouded by scandal, foreign investors are saying that the
world needs rebalancing. A shift from a U.S.-centric world economy is
in the works, says Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley,
who thinks the euro's foreign exchange value will rise to 97 cents.</TE>
<TE>   "We appear to be early in the process of moving to a world where
Europe and Asia become the equals of the U.S. in economic terms,"
says Robert Pelosky Jr., an international economist at Morgan
Stanley. Rebalancing won't be painless. A diminished flow of foreign
investment into the U.S. may well lower U.S. stock prices and could
push up interest rates. But the pain would be offset by increased
opportunities for U.S. business as other countries and regions
increase economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Weaker Dollar Could Spur U.S. Exports</TE>
<TE>   A weaker dollar and stronger euro could spur U.S. exports to
Europe and hike returns from the vast holdings that U.S. firms have
in Europe. That in turn could help narrow the U.S. trade and current
account deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Europe is ripe for reform amid political and economic
upheaval.</TE>
<TE>   The Continent has been shaken politically by an outpouring of
votes for radical candidates such as Jean-Marie Le Pen in France and
by a massive general strike in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Those demonstrations represent "the young who bear the burden of
unemployment and lack of opportunity in countries that fight against
economic change," says Stephan Richter, the Washington-based
publisher of the Globalist, an online newsletter on economic matters.</TE>
<TE>   These upheavals are likely to speed economic reforms such as
lowering tax rates and bringing flexibility to labor practices.</TE>
<TE>   Europe is renowned for rigid labor laws that restrict work hours
and effectively dictate that employees are hired for life. Such laws
have frustrated many U.S. businesspeople. "They have no work ethic; I
wouldn't invest a penny in Europe," says Henry Silverman, chairman of
Cendant Corp., owner of Avis rental cars, Ramada hotels and other
service companies.</TE>
<TE>   The work on reforms is well underway, but a lot more remains to be
done. "Reforms of tax and labor laws are not even half completed" in
Germany, says German banker Frank-Peter Martin, senior partner of
Frankfurt's Metzler Bank.</TE>
<TE>   Another reform is the growing willingness of European companies to
invest in technology and pursue other strategies to boost
productivity. For example, corporate profitability and industrial
productivity are rising as German companies invest outside
Germany--German construction companies are acquiring Polish
construction companies, Martin reports.</TE>
<TE>   Reform in Europe May Come Slowly</TE>
<TE>   In Germany and other European countries, companies are investing
in information technology, for supply management, financial controls
and other efficiencies to offset high labor costs.</TE>
<TE>   Such reforms are new to Europe but could be significant. It was
similar investments in information technology that led to the U.S.
economic and productivity boom of the '90s.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some European companies are already world leaders in
information technology--Nokia of Finland in telecommunications, for
example. And giant Siemens of Germany, a global rival to General
Electric Co., has greatly built up its Internet-related operations in
recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in Europe are still likely to come slowly. European
workers, who incur marginal tax rates of close to 50%, still pay more
in taxes than U.S. workers because they value the health-care
benefits and long vacations typically granted by European law. But
pressures of unemployment and the inability of slow-growing economies
to continue to afford such benefits will force economic
transformation in the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is still likely to grow faster than
that of the European countries, say forecasts issued by the European
Commission and U.S. investment banks.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, the people "want their governments to expand their
economies," says Michael Tennenbaum, head of Special Value Investment
Management, a Los Angeles firm. Tennenbaum recently toured Europe
raising money for a new investment fund. He can't talk about it, but
independent reports say European investors put almost $1 billion into
the fund, which will be invested in the U.S. and globally. European
investors are still very positive on the U.S. economy, Tennenbaum
says.</TE>

<HD>HP Hopes Lessons of Failed Mergers Make It a Success</HD>
<DH>Computers: Officers say they have taken steps to integrate
operations of company, Compaq.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES PILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. managers have earned a vacation after Tuesday's
court ruling that ensures victory in the bitter shareholder battle to
acquire Compaq Computer Corp. Instead, they will be working harder
than ever to disprove legions of doubters who say the company faces
an uphill battle to make good on ambitious promises.</LD>
<LD>   HP faces slack technology spending and the herculean task of
combining gigantic firms with divergent cultures. Past mergers
suggest a daunting future.</LD>
<LD>   "No company in history ... has been able to buy itself out of
mediocrity," said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray. "The integration challenges this company faces [are]
insurmountable."</LD>
<TE>   Failed tech mergers hover like ghosts over HP Chief Executive
Carly Fiorina's assurances of higher profit and cost savings from
streamlined operations and new market initiatives. Compaq became ripe
for the picking, experts said, after it botched acquisitions of
computer makers Tandem Computers Inc. in 1997 and Digital Equipment
Corp. in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   HP officers said they have studied the past--and moved
aggressively to integrate the two giants before the deal becomes
final Tuesday--in order to avoid such pitfalls. More than 1,200 HP
and Compaq employees have logged hundreds of thousands of hours
creating the new organization, and HP has adopted a strategy to cut
overlapping product lines.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Compaq's strong presence in the market for
industry-standard server computers that manage networks will almost
certainly obviate a similar HP division. Likewise, Compaq's popular
iPaq hand-held computer probably will win out over HP's less
successful offering.</TE>
<TE>   But success will depend on melding the two companies quickly,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "They can make dramatic changes ... without any resistance" as
long as it's done within six months, when merger-related losses can
be written off on quarterly reports, said Martin Reynolds, an analyst
with Gartner Inc. Flat demand in technology spending may give HP the
breathing room to make the transition without having to fully test
its new organization for at least six months.</TE>
<TE>   After HP completes its anticipated 12,000 to 15,000 layoffs, it
will face the problem of keeping key Compaq engineers and managers in
the fold. Many previous high-tech combinations failed when employees
cashed in newly liquid stock options, then bolted from large, stodgy
companies in favor of smaller start-ups, said Henry Chesbrough, a
business professor at Harvard University.</TE>
<TE>   Cisco Systems Inc., the network equipment giant, broke that mold
by acquiring dozens of firms while usually retaining key talent. It
did so, in part, because Cisco stock was soaring in a booming tech
economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Cisco also found meaningful roles for the managers of the
acquired companies," Chesbrough said. HP officers "are aware of this
and thinking hard about it. They have Compaq people in meaningful
roles."</TE>
<TE>   HP may lose more of its own long-term employees--many of whom
opposed the merger. But the tech slump ironically may work to HP's
advantage in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are these people going to go?" given the dearth of tech
jobs, Chesbrough said.</TE>
<TE>   A bigger challenge may be turning around HP's stumbling PC
division.</TE>
<TE>   The merged company will become the largest PC maker--Compaq and HP
sold 21% of PCs worldwide in 2001, compared with Dell Computer
Corp.'s 16%--but trend lines are discouraging. HP and Compaq's
combined PC sales fell 19% last year, compared with a 14% drop for
the industry and a 3% rise for Dell, according to International Data
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Dell CEO Michael Dell already has vowed to take market share away
from Palo Alto-based HP amid customer confusion during the transition
period.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts question whether Fiorina--who pushed through the
merger with fearless determination--is well suited to the complexity
of running the new HP, especially after a merger battle that cast
aspersions on her integrity. Her years as an executive at AT&amp;T Corp.
and Lucent Technologies Inc. focused on sales and marketing, not
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "The [HP] board has obviously endorsed Carly and will have to give
her at least a year, but I suspect more like 18 months to demonstrate
that the merger was the right direction," said David Yoffie, a
Harvard Business professor. After that, "any reasonable board would
need to reassess the performance of the CEO."</TE>
<TE>   HP shares Wednesday fell 24 cents to $16.86 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Creditors Pressing Hynix to Sell</HD>
<DH>Chips: South Korean regulators express dismay in the
decision to nix the Micron deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after rejecting a $2.9-billion deal to sell its memory chip
business to Micron Technology Inc., South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor
Inc. is facing intense pressure to reconsider from its creditors and
regulators.</LD>
<LD>   In a blistering comment to South Korean news agencies, the
country's finance minister said Hynix's decision was "regrettable and
embarrassing for the government," which has labored in recent years
to attract foreign investments.</LD>
<LD>   Hynix also is facing the possibility that its creditors, who favor
the deal as a way to recoup part of their $5 billion in loans to the
company, may assert its option to convert more than $2 billion in
bonds this month to stock. Doing so would give creditors a 75% stake
in the company, enough to oust the current board and install members
who would approve a sale.</LD>
<TE>   "This game is far from over," said Jack Geraghty, an analyst with
Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Micron stock rose $1 to $24.70 on the New York Stock Exchange,
partly based on increasing optimism that government pressure will
force the deal through, said David Wu, vice president of research
with Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Hynix officials said Wednesday that they are
determined to steer an independent course and are seeking a buyer for
the company's smaller non-memory-chip business to stay afloat.</TE>
<TE>   But industry analysts say such a move would not only ensure the
company's eventual demise, it also would create a drag on the overall
industry by depressing prices and creating a temporary chip glut amid
the worst downturn in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Hynix "will die slowly under that scenario," Geraghty said. "They
may make it through the next upturn and live, but by the next
downturn, they won't be able to keep up."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, anemic demand from the personal computer industry,
which consumes most of the dynamic random access memory, or DRAM,
chips produced by Hynix, pushed worldwide DRAM sales to $11.2
billion, down dramatically from $28.9billion in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   With chip prices on a roller coaster ride in recent months,
estimates for this year's market ranges from $8 billion to $20
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Extreme price volatility is one reason investors are pushing for
Hynix to sell its DRAM factories and exit the business, leaving 80%
of the market in the hands of three suppliers, Boise, Idaho-based
Micron, Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and Germany's Infineon
Technologies.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem now is that there are too many suppliers and not
enough demand," said Jeremy Lopez, an analyst with Morningstar Inc.
in Chicago. "No one wants to cut supply on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Even executives at Samsung, which would lose its position as the
world's largest memory chip maker should Micron succeed in buying
Hynix, favor the deal.</TE>
<TE>   "Consolidation is good for the industry," said Tom Quinn, vice
president of sales for Samsung's semiconductor business in San Jose.
"We think it brings some level of stability to the industry."</TE>
<TE>   The supply of DRAM chips is expected to remain stable in the next
several years, with companies scaling down investment in new
equipment in the current downturn. As a result, no new factories are
expected to come on line this year.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Delays SEC Filing, May Restate 2001 Results</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp., the largest U.S. retailer to seek protection from
creditors, said Wednesday it may need to restate past results after a
probe of its accounting practices, leading to fears of further big
losses.</LD>
<LD>   Troy, Mich.-based Kmart said its new management needed more time
to prepare the company's annual financial report in light of
accounting reviews by the company and the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The reviews relate to how the company accounts for
rebates, vendor allowances and general liability reserves.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we're going to see some really big losses in a
retrogressive manner," said Richard Hastings, an analyst at Cyber
Credit in New York. "I think it's going to be pretty unpleasant."</LD>
<TE>   The discount chain has not reported fourth-quarter results, but it
said Wednesday its loss in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2002, would
be "significantly higher" than the $244-million loss a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Kmart, the No. 2 discount chain behind Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., fell 9 cents, or 6.7%, to $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Since filing for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
January, Kmart has seen its shares drop about 31%. The stock had
traded as high as $13.50 in August.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart has announced plans to close 283 of its 2,114 stores and cut
22,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Since the bankruptcy, the retailer racked up losses in February
and March and saw its same-store sales decline. Same-store sales, a
key measure of retail performance, exclude results from stores open
less than a year.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart had said it would file its 10-K report with the SEC by
April30 but now is seeking to file the document on May 15.</TE>

<HD>Blue Chips Climb, but Tech Stocks Falter</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Industrials rise for second session, claw back
above 10,000. Bond yields fall amid weak economic reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue chip stocks rose Wednesday--giving the Dow Jones industrial
average its first two-day advance in nearly a month--as investors
again searched for bargains after weeks of declines. But tech stocks
were left behind, falling in response to two disappointing economic
reports.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the Dow's advance, the session had a cautious tone,
reflecting investors' persistent doubts about the strength of the
economy.</LD>
<LD>   "The market is trying to come back as some investors look at it as
oversold. But this is nothing more than a bear market rally," said
Christopher Johnson, managing quantitative analyst at Schaeffer's
Investment Research in Cincinnati.</LD>
<TE>   The Dow closed up 113.41 points, or 1.1%, at 10,059.63, recovering
from an early 115-point drop. The index, which rallied 126 points
Tuesday, hadn't risen for two straight sessions since April 4-5.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market finished mixed, however. The Nasdaq composite
index shed 10.70 points, or 0.6%, to 1,677.53, steadying after an
early 45-point loss. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 9.54
points, or 0.9%, to 1,086.46.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, but
decliners led by a narrow 10-9 margin on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   The early sell-off came on disappointing economic news, including
a report that said manufacturing activity grew at a
slower-than-expected pace in April. Another report said construction
spending dipped 0.9% in March because of a decline in big government
projects.</TE>
<TE>   Investors did have some positive news to chew on. Dow component
Procter &amp; Gamble rose $1.54 to $91.80 after the consumer goods maker
reported fiscal third-quarter earnings a penny higher than analysts
had anticipated. Shoe designer Kenneth Cole, whose profit also beat
expectations by a cent, climbed $1 to $28.</TE>
<TE>   Technology was the weak spot, which has been the case during much
of the recent sell-off and which isn't surprising given that tech
companies are expected to be the last ones to emerge from the
recession. Sun Microsystems was a major drag on the sector, falling
$1.21 to $6.97 after another key executive resigned.</TE>
<TE>   Among other tech leaders, Cisco Systems slid 95 cents to $13.70
and Broadcom dropped 88 cents to $33.62, but Microsoft rose 49 cents
to $52.75.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar declined to a six-month low against the euro
and slipped against the yen, oil prices fell 2% and gold ticked up.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Treasury bond yields fell for the seventh day in the last eight
on the weak economic news and a reduction in the amount of government
debt expected to be sold next week. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note slipped to 5.06% from 5.09% on Tuesday. It
stood at 5.20% on April 19.</TE>
<TE>   * GM gained $1.36 to $65.51 after the company said incentives
helped fuel strong consumer demand for its pickups and sport utility
vehicles. Ford rose 34 cents to $16.34 and DaimlerChrysler advanced
91 cents to $46.55.</TE>
<TE>   * Software firm Peregrine Systems fell $3.40 to $3.45--a 50%
loss--after the firm delayed the release of its quarterly results
because its new auditors need more time to complete work taken over
from Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   * Home builder stocks continued their seven-month run. KB Home
rose $1.70 to $51.55, while DR Horton gained 51 cents to $26.31. The
Bloomberg index of home builder stocks added 2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Among multinational consumer stocks, Coca-Cola helped power the
Dow's gain, rising $2.11 to a 52-week high of $57.62. Rival PepsiCo
jumped $1.02 to $52.92 after raising its quarterly dividend 3.4%, to
15 cents a share. And Philip Morris rose 95 cents to $55.38, its
highest since December 1998. A weaker dollar can help multinationals
by making their foreign sales worth more.</TE>

<HD>Overture Loses AOL Contract to Google</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Overture Services Inc. tumbled by more than a third
Wednesday after the Pasadena-based search engine lost its second
contract in less than three months to rival Google Inc., which
announced a deal to provide search listings to America Online.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had expected Overture to renew its contract with AOL Time
Warner Inc.'s America Online because both companies had announced
last week that they were extending negotiations past a previous
deadline.</LD>
<LD>   The multiyear Google deal surprised the markets, which just last
week had sent Overture's stock soaring 32% on news of the company's
three-year agreement to be the search engine for Yahoo Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Overture shares fell $12.20 to $21.99 during regular trading
Wednesday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Lanny Baker, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said
that despite the loss of the America Online contract, Overture still
remains the stronger of the two search engines.</TE>
<TE>   "My read is that the Yahoo endorsement for Overture is stronger
than the AOL endorsement for Google," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   During a conference call Wednesday, Overture Chief Executive Ted
Meisel told analysts that the loss of AOL, which has 34 million
members, would not significantly affect the span of Overture's
network.</TE>
<TE>   The company estimates that its listings reach more than 85% of
U.S. Internet users.</TE>
<TE>   "We are disappointed not to have AOL as a partner in the U.S. but
remain confident that Overture is well positioned to grow without
it," Meisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Overture, formerly known was GoTo.com, provides
pay-for-performance searches. Advertisers bid for placement in the
search listings, which usually appear as "sponsored sites," and pay
Overture when someone clicks on their links.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which signed an agreement with AOL Europe at the
beginning of the year, will continue to provide listings on America
Online's properties in France, Germany and the United Kingdom through
March 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Overture lost its contract with EarthLink Inc.
to Google.</TE>
<TE>   With its latest agreement, Google's listings will appear on the
AOL service, AOL.com, Netscape and CompuServe during the next few
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The Mountain View, Calif., company launched an expanded paid
search, called AdWords Select, in February.</TE>
<TE>   Google's ability to provide both standard and sponsored listings
gives it an advantage over search engines that offer only pay for
performance, said Omid Kordestani, senior vice president of worldwide
sales and field operations for Google.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view is that we are in a position to offer the best
combination of the two," Kordestani said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very compelling that you're not sacrificing one for the
other."</TE>
<TE>   But during the conference call Wednesday, Overture's Meisel said
there has not been much demand among the company's partners, among
them Microsoft Corp.'s MSN, for additional search capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials said during the call that the company now is
forecasting a profit of 53 cents to 83 cents a share in 2003, less
than the 88-cent average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   The company anticipates a second-quarter profit of 23 cents a
share, down from the 25-cent analyst estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Overture posted a first-quarter profit of 48 cents a share last
week.</TE>

<HD>SBC Pacific Bell Names New President, CEO</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Chuck Smith will lead the state's largest local
phone company as it seeks long-distance access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles native Chuck Smith on Wednesday was named president and
chief executive of SBC Pacific Bell, the state's largest local phone
company.</LD>
<LD>   The move makes Smith the fourth executive to hold the top job at
SBC Pacific Bell since the former Pacific Telesis Group was purchased
five years ago by SBC Communications Inc. Smith replaces Ray Wilkens,
who has been named SBC's senior executive vice president for sales
and marketing.</LD>
<LD>   Smith, who also will serve as president and CEO of SBC Nevada
Bell, takes the job at a critical juncture. SBC PacBell wants
desperately to win state and federal approval to sell long-distance
phone service in its home territory in California.</LD>
<TE>   Getting those approvals has been more difficult than the company
anticipated. In addition, SBC PacBell has come under fire for a
variety of complaints from consumers, including over-aggressive sales
tactics--an allegation that ultimately resulted in a fine.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith is optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm committed to improving and continuing to improve our great
customer service," Smith said. "And we'll continue to improve our
parity service to our competitors ... so that we will be allowed to
get into long-distance."</TE>
<TE>   Smith is a 35-year employee of SBC and predecessor phone companies

He was born in Los Angeles, and owns homes in Baldwin Park and in
Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime chief executive of Pac Bell, Phil Quigley, left the
company shortly after its acquisition was completed in 1997. He was
succeeded by three executives selected by SBC: Ed Mueller, Bill Blase
and Wilkens.</TE>

<HD>Writedowns Lead to First-Quarter Loss at PacifiCare</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Operator of Medicare health plans loses $858.8
million in the period and revenue declines 5.5%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., the biggest operator of Medicare
health plans, said it lost $858.8 million in its first quarter as it
wrote down the value of acquisitions, as expected.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was $24.86 a share, contrasted with net income of $13.2
million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Revenue fell
5.5% to $2.86 billion from $3.03 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Profit would have been $30.1 million, or 87 cents, without the
$897-million writedown of assets related to a change in how mergers
are accounted for, the company said.</LD>
<TE>   On that basis, PacifiCare was expected to earn 72 cents, the
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First
Call.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of the Santa Ana-based company rose $1.44 to a 52-week high
of $31.70 on Nasdaq before the results were announced. The stock
eased to $30.55 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare said it will issue almost 421,000 shares to hedge fund
Acqua Wellington Asset Management today at an average price of
$21.39. The share issue is part of a $150-million equity line of
credit agreement the company reached last year. PacifiCare said it
will get $9 million from the deal.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare has struggled to meet medical costs that rose when it
renegotiated contracts with California doctors to pay them based on
the cost of care. PacifiCare in January cut 1,300 jobs, or 15% of its
work force, to reduce expenses. The company also faces a lawsuit in
Texas over unpaid medical claims.</TE>
<TE>   The company had 3.3 million customers when the quarter ended, down
13% from the year-ago quarter and 4% from the end of the year as
PacifiCare closed some Medicare health plans.</TE>
<TE>   Premiums rose 15% for employer health plans and 10% for customers
in Medicare and Medicare supplement plans.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care costs fell to 88.8 cents of every premium dollar, from
90.2 cents a year earlier, after the company left unprofitable
markets and ended contracts with costly providers.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare agreed last month to pay $87.3 million to settle
accusations that it overbilled the U.S. government for insurance
payments under a health insurance program for federal employees. A
whistle-blower lawsuit said the inflated claims were submitted
between 1990 and 1994 by a health maintenance organization PacifiCare
bought in 1997.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pfizer Inc., the nation's largest drug maker, said Wednesday that it
will build a major biomedical research campus in La Jolla where more
than 1,000 scientists will work on drug discovery.</LD>
<LD>   The Pfizer La Jolla site will be built on the current facilities
of Agouron Pharmaceuticals, which Pfizer acquired in June 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The campus eventually will include eight buildings and 800,000
square feet of space, representing an investment of $155 million, a
spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   Pfizer Chief Executive Hank McKinnell said La Jolla was a logical
extension of the company's research capabilities, which includes
large facilities in England, Connecticut and Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   "The piece that was missing was the West Coast," McKinnell said.
"Here in Agouron we have the base on the West Coast that we really
wanted. I see it as a magnet to attract the kind of people we need to
succeed in this business."</TE>
<TE>   The pharmaceutical industry spends nearly $35 billion a year in
California on research, manufacturing and more, said Perry
Communications Group, a health care public relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   But Pfizer La Jolla represents the first time that a major company
has created its own presence in the state through acquisition and
expansion, Perry Group said.</TE>

<HD>PG&amp;E Reports Profit for Quarter</HD>
<DH>Energy: Sharp drop in power costs help parent of Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric rebound from loss it posted a year ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PG&amp;E Corp. posted a first-quarter profit Wednesday, reversing a loss
from a year earlier, when it took hefty charges for its utility unit,
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., which had filed for bankruptcy
protection.</LD>
<LD>   The turnaround was driven by a sharp drop in the cost of the power
that the utility, California's largest, purchases to supply its
customers in Northern and Central California.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based company earned $631 million, or $1.71 a
share, contrasted with a loss of $951 million, or $2.62, in the
year-earlier period.</LD>
<TE>   Revenue fell to $4.77 billion, down from $6.67 billion in the
prior-year quarter.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E took charges of $1.2 billion, or $3.32 a share, in the
year-earlier quarter related to sky-high power costs that the company
was barred from passing on to customers under California's
deregulation laws.</TE>
<TE>   The subsequent collapse in wholesale power prices linked to the
economic downturn has allowed the utility to cover its costs and also
recover some of the money spent the previous year, even though slower
demand has hurt revenue for PG&amp;E's power-plant operations outside
California.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings from operations fell to $220 million, or 60 cents a
share, from $255 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings from operations exclude "headroom." Headroom, used to
recover previously written off costs, is the difference between
retail rates and wholesale power costs for the utility.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street analysts, who excluded that cost cushion from their
projections, had expected the company to earn 53 cents to 65 cents a
share, with an average forecast of 59 cents, according to research
firm Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst Mike Worms of Gerard Klauer Mattison said the company's
results were "more or less" in line with analysts' forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the weak economy and problems in California have hurt
the earnings capabilities of the utility," Worms said, noting that
economic weakness and mild weather also had an adverse effect on the
company's key unregulated unit, PG&amp;E National Energy Group.</TE>
<TE>   PG&amp;E shares fell 1 cent to $23.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, a PG&amp;E spokesman dismissed reports that a
California lawmaker is seeking to arrange the purchase of its utility
unit to make it a not-for-profit agency.</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose Mercury News reported that Assembly Speaker Pro Tem
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) is talking to would-be investors about
a buyout.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a silly idea," said Ron Low, a spokesman for the utility.
"With the state facing a budget deficit of up to $20 billion, we feel
Mr. Keeley should be focused on more pressing issues."</TE>
<TE>   Keeley could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS' Staff to Urge Fund to Resume Philippine Investment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS' staff will urge the giant U.S. pension fund to reverse a
February decision to pull about $15 million in stock holdings out of
the Philippines, a fund spokesman said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The staff move follows a review of the Philippines that showed the
country meets the fund's requirement that stock exchange transactions
be settled within three days of the trade date.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS, the California Public Employees' Retirement System,
sparked controversy in February when it announced plans to sell
assets in the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia because
those nations did not meet tough new fund investment standards, some
involving human rights.</LD>
<TE>   The move triggered fears in Asia that other large investors would
follow CalPERS' lead.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the decision, officials from the Philippines--which
missed the cut for financial rather than human rights reasons--began
pressing the fund to rethink the decision to divest.</TE>
<TE>   Although CalPERS had earlier given Manila a low score for market
liquidity and the openness of its markets, the gain in the efficiency
of settlements, which was reported to CalPERS' staff in April, bumped
the country's total score into the range of admissible investments,
CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   The staff recommendation will be put before the fund's investment
committee May 13. Pacheco said the staff did not anticipate
recommending reinstatement for the other countries dropped.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Group Seeking to Gain Control of the Arco Plaza</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Kings Capital has purchased portion of debt on
downtown L.A. landmark to put pressure on Japanese owner Shuwa to
sell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A low-key Orange County investment group has launched an effort to
win control of the landmark Arco Plaza in downtown Los Angeles from
its Japanese owners.</LD>
<LD>   San Juan Capistrano-based Kings Capital, a privately held firm
controlled by real estate investor Kenneth A. Picerne, has purchased
a portion of the debt on Arco Plaza and its twin 52-story
skyscrapers, according to people familiar with the transaction.
Industry observers say Picerne purchased the debt as part of a plan
to put pressure on property owner Shuwa Investment Corp. to sell the
nearly 2.5-million-square-foot complex it purchased for an estimated
$650 million in 1986.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure [Picerne] did it with the intention of controlling the
property," said one real estate executive with knowledge of debt
purchase.</LD>
<TE>   In a brief statement, Kings Capital said it had "recently
concluded a significant transaction with Shuwa Investment Corp. and
Shuwa Corp. involving numerous assets in Japan and also involving the
Arco Plaza project in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Kings Capital officials were not available for further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Executives at Shuwa Investment in Los Angeles could not be
reached.</TE>
<TE>   Kings Capital is one of a number of companies controlled by
Picerne. He has been involved in previous deals that include the
purchase of loans on distressed U.S. properties owned by Japanese
investors, according to some Orange County real estate and investment
observers. However, little is known about the firm's holdings or its
backers.</TE>
<TE>   Arco Plaza has been on and off the market several times in recent
years as Shuwa and other Japanese investors reduced their U.S. real
estate holdings that were amassed during a buying boom in the late
1980s. Many of those properties now are worth a fraction of their
purchase prices, and many Japanese investors are under pressure by
lenders to sell the assets.</TE>
<TE>   Shuwa has been able to attract some major tenants in recent
months--such as the architecture firm Daniel Mann Johnson &amp;
Mendenhall--to Arco Plaza, which occupies an entire block at Fifth
and Flower streets. However, about one-third of the office space is
vacant, according to real estate data provider CoStar Group Inc.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Refinancings Up in First Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A greater number of U.S. homeowners refinanced their mortgage loans
to squeeze some equity from their homes in the first three months of
this year, according to Freddie Mac, one of the nation's largest
providers of housing finance.</LD>
<LD>   Of the loans that were refinanced in the first quarter, 61% were
cash-out refinances, up from last year's first-quarter levels of 51%
and the fourth quarter's 48%.</LD>
<LD>   Low loan rates and rising home prices spurred these refinancings
and allowed consumers to shore up their household finances. The
ability to refinance has buttressed spending in an economy that is
struggling to rebound from recession.</LD>
<TE>   "Refinancings last year and early this year probably did have a
positive effect on the economy," said Robert Van Order, an economist
at Freddie Mac.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, borrowers even took on a slight increase in monthly
mortgage payments to get money from cash-out refinancings.</TE>
<TE>   Van Order said home prices have risen over the last five years at
a pace exceeding inflation. "So, these are real gains" in home
values, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac said it expects 30-year mortgage rates to linger at
around 7% through spring.</TE>
<TE>   The government agency also reported that the median age of a loan
being refinanced was 3.8 years in the first quarter of 2002, more
than double the median age of loans in the first three months of
2001. Freddie Mac also said only about 11% of the mortgages
refinanced in the first three months of this year had lower new loan
amounts.</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac said the median house price rose 17% since the
mortgage was first underwritten, up from 11% in the first quarter of
2001.</TE>

<LD>U.S. housing affordability fell in the first quarter, a slippage
attributed to rising home prices and higher interest rates.</LD>

to 137.2 in the quarter from 141.0 in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   When the index measures 100, a family earning the median income

<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp.'s Windows software would collapse like a "house of
cards" under an antitrust proposal by nine states to strip Internet
Explorer from the operating system, a computer scientist testified.</LD>
<LD>   MIT professor Stuart E. Madnick said it would be "difficult, if
not impossible, to implement" the states' proposal for a "modular"
version of Windows that would let computer makers easily remove
programs such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player. The
professor likened Windows to a brick wall that would topple without
the blocks of computer code that make up the system's Web browser.</LD>
<LD>   Madnick is the 13th witness to testify against the states'
proposals for tougher remedies than the software maker agreed to
accept in a proposed settlement of the U.S. government's 4-year-old
antitrust case.</LD>
<TE>   A Princeton University computer scientist, Andrew Appel, testified
for the states that there are no technical barriers to a
stripped-down version of Windows.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft shares rose 49 cents to $52.75 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>NCR Pact on Bar-Code Scan Patents Upheld</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Customers of NCR Corp., a maker of bar-code scanners for retailers,
need not face patent-infringement lawsuits by a foundation that has
collected $1 billion in fees from other companies, a U.S. appeals
court said.</LD>
<LD>   The Lemelson Medical Education &amp; Research Foundation, which says
its late founder, Jerome Lemelson, invented technology used in
bar-code scanners, sought to cancel a patent-licensing agreement with
NCR that also covered companies that use its products.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a contract
"unambiguously granted NCR's customers a license to use bar-code
scanning equipment using Lemelson patents." The two-page opinion
issued April 23 said the foundation's "mistake in agreeing to those
terms" didn't void the agreement.</LD>
<TE>   The Las Vegas-based foundation has successfully sought fees from
more than 800 businesses and is suing hundreds of retailers, seeking
part of their sales because stores use bar-code scanners to ring up
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Dayton, Ohio-based NCR fell 18 cents to $38.68 on the
NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation's lawyers couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>SEC Meeting to Address Questions From Investors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that it will
hold its first "investor summit" May 10 to give ordinary investors a
chance to ask questions and comment on the agency's actions in the
aftermath of Enron Corp.'s collapse.</LD>
<LD>   The Enron debacle and the role of its former auditor Arthur
Andersen, along with recent accounting failures at other big
companies, have made many investors wary of the accuracy of corporate
financial reports and skittish about the stock market.</LD>
<LD>   "We are moving aggressively to restore investor confidence on
every front, including corporate disclosure, auditor oversight and
analyst recommendations," SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt said. "As we
work with lawmakers, regulators, consumer organizations and industry
groups, there is no more important voice for us to hear than that of
the investing public."</LD>
<TE>   The SEC, which is pursuing a civil investigation of Enron and
Andersen, recently proposed new rules requiring firms to file
quarterly and annual reports faster and to disclose more information
to investors. On Tuesday, the agency proposed rules that would
require firms to better explain their financial condition in annual
reports.</TE>
<TE>   The investor meeting will be held at the SEC's headquarters in
Washington and broadcast over the Internet so anyone can participate.</TE>
<TE>   It will begin with a panel discussion moderated by Pitt. In
another session, Pitt, SEC commissioners and SEC division directors
will respond to questions and comments from the public.</TE>
<TE>   People who want to ask questions or offer comments ahead of time
may send an e-mail to summit@sec.gov or call (877) 404-3222.
Questions and comments also can be submitted during the event by
e-mail or telephone.</TE>
<TE>   The live audio Webcast will be available on the SEC Web site at
www.sec.gov.</TE>

<HD>Shares of Oracle and Sun Sink on Investor Worries</HD>
<DH>Technology: Sector's stars are suffering from personnel
changes and fears that sales aren't rebounding as hoped.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of the technology industry's biggest stars of the late 1990s saw
their shares fall to multiyear lows Wednesday on investor concern
about the businesses' near-term prospects.</LD>
<LD>   Network computer systems firm Sun Microsystems Inc.'s shares
slumped $1.21, or 15%, to $6.97 on Nasdaq, the lowest price since
1998, after President and Chief Operating Officer Edward J. Zander
said he is stepping down after more than 15 years at the firm. He
joins a number of key executives who recently have decided to leave.</LD>
<LD>   Software giant Oracle Corp.'s shares dropped 59 cents, or 5.9%, to
$9.45 on Nasdaq, their lowest since 1999, on worries that the firm's
results will fall short of expectations in the current quarter.</LD>
<TE>   Though many technology shares have tumbled this year, most of the
biggest names remain above their multiyear lows reached after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Sun and Oracle now are exceptions.</TE>
<TE>   Zander, 55, is the fourth high-ranking Sun official in recent
weeks to announce plans to step down. Others include Chief Financial
Officer Michael E. Lehman, Executive President of Enterprise Services
Larry Hambly and Executive Vice President of Computer Services John
Shoemaker.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it looks like a flurry here," Sun Chief Executive Scott G.
McNealy said Wednesday. But "I think it's been positive and planned
out. We are on plan in executing just about everything we wanted to
do here from a management-succession and organization-structure
perspective."</TE>
<TE>   McNealy will take the title of president as well after Zander
departs.</TE>
<TE>   Sun, which makes high-end networking computers and software, has
been hard hit in the wake of the collapse of many dot-com and telecom
firms that were prime customers for its equipment.</TE>
<TE>   But McNealy said the company is back on track.</TE>
<TE>   "Sun's in great shape," he said. "We've got $6 billion in cash.
We're on target for meeting our profitability goals this quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of their public statements, the Sun managers'
departures to a degree speak to their confidence, said Richard Chu,
analyst at SG Cowen Securities.</TE>
<TE>   "They believe they're leaving the company in good shape. There's a
lot of evidence fundamentally that that's the case," he said.
"Nonetheless, they're taking their skin out of the game."</TE>
<TE>   As for Oracle, analysts said investors have driven the stock lower
in recent days on fears that sales aren't rebounding as hoped.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Oracle Chief Financial Officer Jeff Henley predicted
earnings of 13 cents to 14 cents a share in the current quarter. The
average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call
is 13 cents. Oracle earned 15 cents a share a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   But last week, Henley said at a meeting of investors sponsored by
Prudential Securities that "the current environment continues to be
very difficult. We don't know when the economy's going to turn."</TE>
<TE>   Oracle has been hurt by pricing pressure and a perception that its
Web-based business software contains bugs, Lehman Bros. analyst Neil
Herman said in a new report. Herman cut his earnings estimate for
Oracle's current quarter to 11 cents a share from a previous estimate
of 13 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the stocks' nominally low prices, the companies continue
to boast high market capitalizations. Oracle is valued at $51.9
billion; Sun is valued at $22.6 billion. Those figures reflect the
huge number of shares outstanding from both firms, analysts noted.</TE>

<HD>Suit Seeks to Bar Mexican Trucks</HD>
<DH>Labor: Move is latest salvo in a campaign to restrict their
access to U.S. Groups cite air pollution concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of labor, environmental and trucking industry groups
filed suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court to keep Mexican trucks
off U.S. highways, claiming that thousands of older diesel trucks
will worsen air pollution in areas plagued by smog.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks to prevent the Bush administration from signing
regulations Friday that would open the border to Mexico-based trucks
within a few months. Such a move would "result in substantial
increases in air pollution and a diminution in air quality in
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, with attendant increased
risks to human health," according to the suit, filed in San Francisco
by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Environmental Law
Foundation, Public Citizen, the California Trucking Assn. and the
California Labor Federation.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the Transportation Department, the primary
defendant, said they were reviewing the complaint and had no comment.
However, spokesman Dave Longo said he did not expect the lawsuit to
derail the department's plans. "We're on schedule and still
anticipate being able to open the border by this summer," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The suit is the latest salvo in a Teamsters' campaign to restrict
access promised to Mexican trucking firms by the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which the union fears will cost U.S. jobs and put
downward pressure on wages. Mexico's leading truck drivers union also
is opposed to an unrestricted border opening, claiming its members
will struggle to compete against big U.S. trucking firms.</TE>
<TE>   Large shippers and trucking lines on both sides of the border
favor the opening, and the Mexican government has lobbied for prompt
access.</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters earlier raised safety concerns, which eventually
were addressed by Congress and the Bush administration. It now claims
legitimate environmental concerns are being ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue here is if we're going to let the Mexican trucks
on U.S. highways, then we have to make them meet the same standards,"
said Teamsters spokesman Rob Black.</TE>
<TE>   In March, when it issued regulations allowing cross-border
trucking, the Transportation Department determined Mexico-based
trucks "would have no environmental impact" on U.S. air pollution
levels. President Bush is set to sign those regulations Friday. The
lawsuit seeks a restraining order until environmental impacts are
fully assessed.</TE>
<TE>   "Diesel exhaust is a very strong carcinogen," said Al Meyerhoff,
one of the lead attorneys in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Meyerhoff said Mexican trucks pollute more than U.S. rigs because
of less-stringent air-quality standards in Mexico, for both engines
and fuel, and because the trucks tend to be older.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also claims the federal government is prevented by its
Clean Air Act from taking action that increases air pollution in
regions that are out of compliance with federal pollution standards,
which includes much of Southern California and other border areas.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit has drawn together some unlikely partners, including
California's key trucking industry group. "Basic survival can make
for strange bedfellows," said Stephanie Williams, vice president for
legislative affairs for the California Trucking Assn., which has
split from the national U.S. trucking association on this issue.</TE>
<TE>   California truckers already are at a competitive disadvantage
because, for environmental reasons, fuel prices are higher here than
elsewhere in the United States. Mexico-based trucks could operate
even more cheaply, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a level playing field for fuel and engines," she said.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer filed a friend of the court
brief, saying the Bush administration erred when it found that
cross-border trucking would not increase air pollution in the state.
Lockyer notes that the state could lose federal funds if it fails to
meet Clean Air Act standards.</TE>
<TE>   The Teamsters estimated the opening would draw about 30,000
Mexico-based trucks in the second half of 2002, with numbers climbing
sharply after that. Mexico-based trucks now can cross into the U.S.,
but must remain within 25 miles of the border.</TE>

<HD>Unocal's Credit Outlook, Rating Reduced</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unocal Inc.'s credit outlook was revised to negative by Moody's
Investors Service and its rating was reduced by Egan-Jones Ratings
Co. after the oil and natural-gas producer said first-quarter profit
plunged.</LD>
<LD>   Egan-Jones cut Unocal one level to BBB from BBB-plus after the
company said Tuesday that net income fell 93% from a year earlier and
that output at a Gulf of Mexico oilfield dropped. The rating is two
notches above "junk" status.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's changed its outlook on Unocal's long-term debt to negative
from stable, citing the effect of lower commodity prices on the
firm's debt levels and concerns about spending needed to sustain
growth in oil and gas production.</LD>
<TE>   In the first quarter, the price Unocal received for its natural
gas worldwide fell by almost half, and it sold oil for 26% less.
Total production slipped 3.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of El Segundo-based Unocal rose 56 cents to $37.75 on the
New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 4.7% this year.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi May Take Charge of $1.1 Billion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the latest setback for Vivendi Universal CEO Jean-Marie Messier,
Vivendi has disclosed that the company may incur an off-balance-sheet
charge of up to $1.1 billion as the result of a complex financing
arrangement.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi said this week that it committed in 2001 to buy back 19.7
million of its own shares at prices between $54 and $73 as part of a
plan to raise money to pay for management stock options.</LD>
<LD>   The buyback would cost it $634 million to $1.1 billion, Vivendi
said on its Web site Wednesday. The disclosure came in response to
questions from analysts and investors, who've grown increasingly
impatient with Messier's management strategy and Vivendi's
$26-billion debt load.</LD>
<TE>   Off-balance-sheet accounting also is getting more scrutiny from
investors in the wake of Enron Corp.'s collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Messier also has been under pressure to quell a management crisis
at the company's Canal Plus pay TV business.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi spokeswoman Anita Larsen said the liability had been
discussed at a March workshop with analysts and was included in the
annual report.</TE>
<TE>   "We have fully met our obligations," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the company's debt load, Vivendi may have to pay an
additional $250million to record impresario Herb Alpert and his
business partner, Jerry Moss, founders of independent Music publisher
Rondor Music International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Alpert and Moss can demand a cash payment if Vivendi shares trade
below $37.50 for 10 consecutive days, as it has since April 3.
Vivendi closed up 14 cents to $32.26 Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Rondor's agreement with Seagram gives Alpert and Moss until 2005
to ask for compensation from the company.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi acquired Rondor when it bought Seagram Co.'s Universal
Music Group in December 2000.</TE>

<HD>Not Much to Fix at WorldCom?</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Experts say the long-distance carrier can wait for
the economy, but they suggest short-term changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI and ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite Wall Street's ongoing battering of troubled WorldCom Inc.,
some industry experts say there's really not much for the new chief
executive to fix at the nation's second-largest long-distance
telephone carrier.</LD>
<LD>   "When the economy turns around and when capital spending revives,
WorldCom will come back," said Jim Friedland, a stock analyst at
Robertson Stephens in San Francisco. "Until then, you can't just
tighten a screw to fix things."</LD>
<LD>   John Sidgmore, promoted to chief executive Tuesday to replace
ousted founder Bernard J. Ebbers, promised to review all the
company's business lines, with an eye toward selling non-core or
poor-performing units and focusing on high-growth areas such as data
services. Such moves and others will help the company, but "there's
not much broken," said stock analyst Kevin Calabrese at Argus
Research in New York.</LD>
<TE>   Even a bond market expert such as Cory Jackson, one of many who
question where WorldCom will come up with funds to repay $5.6 billion
in debts coming due in the next two years, figures the company can
sell assets and renegotiate loans to help in the short term.</TE>
<TE>   "But a turn in the economy and improvement in their enterprise
data business [fiber-optic lines that corporations use] are really
what's needed," said the U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom, of course, has serious problems to address, and its
long-term viability is not assured, analysts said. The company has a
staggering $29.3 billion in debt, its revenue is shrinking and the
shaky economic recovery and the big drop-off in spending by corporate
America are wreaking havoc with WorldCom's finances.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the big credit-rating companies are considering
reducing WorldCom's bonds to below investment grade, which could
trigger bank loan provisions to repay $2 billion in loans and leave
the company with no cash on hand to pay off bond debts. The company
already is trying to change its loan terms to remove the trigger, and
some analysts are betting the company will succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore's biggest job will be to calm the bond markets, said
stock analyst Peter Comack at Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami. "The bond market
is indicating that the stock's worth zero," he said. And without new
bond sales, the company won't be able to repay up to $3.1 billion in
debts maturing next year.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock slid 27 cents to a new 10-year low of $2.21
Wednesday as its bonds fell further in value.</TE>
<TE>   Among the near-term steps the company should take, they said, are
to sell assets such as its majority stake in Brazil's Embratel
Participacoes carrier, renegotiate its bank loan package, cut
expenses, curtail capital spending and reduce a cash dividend that
its separately traded MCI Group unit pays. Posting second-quarter
results at least stable compared with the first quarter also would be
a boon.</TE>
<TE>   MCI said Wednesday that it is increasing rates for customers who
are not on various long-distance and calling card plans. Certain
international plans also are getting price hikes. Altogether, the
increases affect about 10% of the customers. MCI, AT&amp;T Corp. and
Sprint Corp. have been raising prices for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Sidgmore promised in conference calls with reporters and analysts
Tuesday that WorldCom, which has acquired more than 70 companies
since the mid-1990s, will review its worldwide business with an eye
toward restructuring.</TE>
<TE>   "We've acquired new technologies, wireless technologies and
others, that may not be [a priority] now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Comack doubts WorldCom has any significant assets to sell. It
would be mostly small pieces that wouldn't bring in much. Still, he
said, "Every penny counts."</TE>
<TE>   The review is likely to attract interest from people such as Tom
Gores, who has purchased a string of telecom businesses as president
and chief executive of Platinum Equity in Los Angeles. His firm is
preparing a bid for telecom network operator Global Crossing Ltd.,
which has filed for bankruptcy protection. But Gores said, "We're
looking at everything," including smaller and non-critical businesses
that WorldCom and other large companies want to sell.</TE>

<LD>Bob Smizik in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Now that he has won the
Masters again, and a historic grand slam is within his reach, there
are people out there, well-respected people, claiming that Tiger
Woods is the best athlete on the planet.</LD>
<LD>   "Excuse me, while I convulse with laughter ... This is not to
suggest golfers are not athletes. They are ... But to submit that
this puts him in the same class as Barry Bonds or Alex Rodriguez or
Allen Iverson or Kobe Bryant or Marshall Faulk or dozens of other
competitors in major sports is preposterous ...</LD>
<LD>   "Some sports demand a high level of athletic ability. Others, not
much at all. Golf is one of those sports."</LD>
<TE>   We assume Smizik plays golf and has been under pressure to hit a
ball from a bad lie, into the wind, over water to a fast green with
considerable money riding on the shot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the 100 and 200 meter records in the
UCLA-USC men's track and field meet series?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Speed trap: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Randy
Johnson closes out a game by whiffing Todd Helton on pitches clocked
at 100, 100 and 99 mph. Amazing. The cunning lefty sets up Helton
with fastballs and then gets him on a changeup."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "Random nugget from the Baseball Encyclopedia: He
played one game at third base for the Indians in 1917--Ferd Eunick."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Coaching lifer: Peter May of the Boston Globe writes that Gregg
Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs is a coaching disciple of
Philadelphia 76er Coach Larry Brown. Said Popovich: "A lot of people
get retired in the job they have. But not Larry. He's always looking
for something new. He's always teaching. If he found some guy on a
street corner who had a good idea, he'd pull out a napkin and have
him diagram it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Selig's nightmare: Norman Chad on America Online: "Who wouldn't
want a Montreal-Minnesota World Series? Maybe Bud Selig. There would
be nothing better than an Expos-Twins fall classic--it would be like
two inmates on death row winning the Powerball lottery.</TE>
<TE>   "Heck, Selig might even encourage the players to strike in
September to avoid the embarrassment of his contraction victims
playing in October."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Easy, man, easy: Indiana Pacer Jermaine O'Neal, after receiving
the NBA's most-improved-player award: "I want to get to the point
where I can destroy the entire league. I plan on being here next year
with a different speech. Hopefully, I'm 10 to 20 times better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1917, Cincinnati's Fred Toney and the
Chicago Cubs' Hippo Vaughn matched no-hitters for nine innings before
Vaughn wilted in the 10th and the Reds won, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: UCLA's Ato Boldon has the 100 record at 10.04
seconds set in 1996; USC's Clancy Edwards holds the 200 record at
20.03 seconds set in 1978.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jerry West is a perfectionist, which may hinder him
as the new president of the Memphis Grizzlies. In a playoff game
against the New York Knicks, West had outplayed Walt Frazier, but
later told a reporter: "Remember the two-on-one early in the second
quarter? I had a guy open and I threw it behind him."</TE>

<LD>A consumer's guide to the best and worst of sports media and

<LD>   What: "From the Desert to the Derby"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Jason Levin</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Daily Racing Form Press</TE>
<TE>   Price: $24.94</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind this book was to take the reader inside the ruling
family of Dubai's billion-dollar quest to win the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Levin undertook this ambitious project when he found he had
time on his hands after being among the staff members who were laid
off from FoxSports.com. Levin, the Web site's national horse racing
writer, had been working on a story about Godolphin Racing, the
operation run by Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.</TE>
<TE>   The story evolved into this book, which is well-researched and
clearly written. But it doesn't deliver on its promise of a look
inside the Maktoum family.</TE>
<TE>   Levin, not given the access he had hoped for, was left on the
outside and had to rely heavily on what already had been written.</TE>
<TE>   The result is too much horse racing play-by-play and not enough
from Sheikh Mohammed, who isn't heard from until the final chapter.
Levin finally was able to talk with him at the Arc de Triomphe in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Initially the book is compelling because it begins at last year's
Keeneland sales in Kentucky. The second day of the Keeneland affair
was Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   As the tragic events of that day unfold, much of the attention is
focused on Sheikh Mohammed, and not just because he spends millions
of dollars on his quest to win the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   He also is the defense minister of the United Arab Emirates and a
powerful voice in the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   But just as Levin grabs the reader, he loses his focus and goes
with too much bland historical material.</TE>

<LD>Harvard-Westlake High senior Jesse Ferlianto defeated Glendale
Hoover's Samuel Tadevosian, 6-2, to forge a 9-9 tie and clinch a
victory on games, 79-62, for the Wolverines in a nonleague boys'
tennis match Wednesday at Studio City Golf and Tennis.</LD>
<LD>   The victory over Tadevosian was the only one of the day for
Ferlianto, the Wolverines' No. 1 singles player who has missed
several matches recently because of a strained left hamstring and
sore groin.</LD>
<LD>   Hoover's Dylan Kim and Sergy Vargramian swept at Nos. 1 and 3
singles, respectively, for the Tornadoes (18-1), ranked No. 5 by The
Times. Fourth-ranked Harvard-Westlake (20-1), though, built an early
lead by sweeping the first six doubles sets, five at 6-0.</LD>

<LD>I don't want to screw up and write the word xxxx in the newspaper,
because we're not supposed to use that word, which really xxxxs when
you have to write a column discussing the use of that word.</LD>
<LD>   This past weekend, for example, the Mariners wouldn't let anyone
enter their stadium if they were wearing a "Yankees Xxxx" T-shirt.
Well, that's not true, if they had actually been wearing a "Yankees
Xxxx" T-shirt they would have been allowed into the ballpark, but
because they used the word I can't use, they were stopped.</LD>
<LD>   The Mariners refused to apologize for making fans turn their
shirts inside out, and now legal action might be taken against the
organization with ACLU talk of First Amendment violations.</LD>
<TE>   Here in L.A., of course, we don't have that problem because we
have parents who are a lot smarter, painting "Xxxx" on the bare back
of their son, and then sitting back with pride as he becomes a
Staples Center crowd favorite at Kings' games.</TE>
<TE>   "Our policy is that 'xxxx' is not an offensive word," said Michael
Roth, Staples' spin control expert.</TE>
<TE>   In fact the folks at Staples tell me they have never received a
complaint about the youngster who is at most home games with the name
of the Kings' opponent on his bare back along with the word I cannot
use.</TE>
<TE>   "His nickname is 'Little Big Man,'" said Brenda Tinnen, senior
vice president for a lot of stuff at Staples. "He's beloved by the
fans for his shtick."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry, I'm going to have to check to see if I can write shtick
in the paper.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the kid on the overhead scoreboard during one of the Kings'
playoff games, dancing and turning his back for the camera's benefit
so no one would miss "Avs Xxxx," the crowd roaring with approval. Oh,
we love it here when our kids stick it to the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   It must be a special moment at home, too, when mom or dad have
"Little Big Man" turn around so they can print "Xxxx" on his back. I
hope they're taking home videos to show the relatives over the
holidays.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably 11-12 or 13-years-old, and he has 'Kings Rule' on
his belly and the name of the team we're playing with the word 'Xxxx'
on his back," Tinnen said. "If we don't get him on the scoreboard, I
get letters from fans complaining."</TE>
<TE>   I asked Tinnen if she was offended by the word "xxxx," and she
said, "It's not one of George Carlin's seven banned words on TV," and
she started to go through the list. But like most Staples Center
officials I know, I told her I was already impressed with her
knowledge of profanity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I SAW the word "xxxx" on the Staples scoreboard so often in the
three Kings' playoff games I attended--what with all the signs the
youngsters were holding up--I began to think Colorado was really a
horrible team until it blasted the Kings, and then it dawned on me
who really xxxxs.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to make sure the fans are screaming and going crazy in
Staples," said Kurt Schwartzkopf, the Kings' vice president in charge
of inciting crowds. "And there's no question our fans love the
dancing kid with the word 'xxxx' on his back."</TE>
<TE>   The kid will probably grow up one day to become an ACLU attorney.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DISCOVERED L.A.-based comedy writer Tim O'Donnell might very
well be responsible for making "xxxx" a household word. In 1990 his
TV show, "Uncle Buck," kicked off the fall season in prime time, and
the very first words delivered on the show were from 6-year-old
Maizy, yelling at her 8-year-old brother, "Miles, you xxxx."</TE>
<TE>   O'Donnell said no one remembers that Uncle Buck grounded the kid
for using language like that, but to be honest, he said, "If you took
xxxx out of the English language today most kids would have to learn
to talk with their hands."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the kids I see at sporting events these days already talk
with their hands. Some grow up to be grumpy pitchers for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   In fact I think the Dodgers, just as much as O'Donnell, deserve
credit for making "xxxx" a regular part of our kids' vocabulary. Now
we have kids coming to the ballpark for the Giants-Dodgers' rivalry,
listening to everyone around them chanting, "Barry xxxxs," and it's
not only accepted, but parentally inspired.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not a word that's considered profanity," said Derrick
Hall, the Dodgers' vice president for making everything sound good.</TE>
<TE>   Now as good luck would have it, I discovered it will be "Lunch
Box" giveaway night when Gary Sheffield returns to town for the first
time on Aug. 23. That means when kids return to school with lunch box
in hand, they'll have a reminder of how they've been rewarded for
yelling, "Gary xxxxs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M SURE the Lakers have talent lined up to sing the national
anthem during the playoffs, but if they have an opening they should
bring in 11-year-old Joelle James, who rocked Dodger Stadium the
other night.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WAS going to say that Jerry West going to Memphis isn't the end
of the world, but I've worked in Memphis, so I can't say that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WERE 125 media voters who placed Shaquille O'Neal on the
All-NBA first team, and one who dropped him to third. I called Fred
Hickman, who is now doing the pre- and post-game shows for the
Yankees' network, and he said, "Tell everyone it wasn't me. I didn't
vote."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Bob Kempf:</TE>
<TE>   "You're helping the Dodgers with their hitting, now what about
your spelling? You wrote: "I better do good tonight or your going to
pound me, aren't you? Do you see your boo-boo, T.J.?"</TE>
<TE>   When your right, your right.</TE>

<HD>Seattle's Victory Keeps Lakers in Limbo</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The Lakers haven't learned a thing this week.</LD>
<LD>   They still don't know who they'll face Sunday in the next round of
the playoffs. And they can't get an accurate read on their two
potential opponents, because Wednesday's 91-79 Seattle SuperSonics'
victory over the San Antonio Spurs in Game 4 didn't reflect either
team.</LD>
<LD>   The Spurs had to play without their two 7-footers. Tim Duncan
missed the game to be with his family after his father died, and
David Robinson has been out since Game 1 because of a sore back. The
results were predictably dismal. They trailed by as many as 28
points.</LD>
<TE>   But a blowout victory at home against a depleted team doesn't say
much about the SuperSonics. They did what they were supposed to do.
They did what any self-respecting team would have done if the Golden
State Warriors magically appeared in their arena for the playoffs,
which is basically what happened Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's down to a winner-take-all Game 5 Friday in San Antonio.
Whoever the Lakers get will be the greater of two lessers. It doesn't
matter which one of these teams they play, they won't play more than
two home games. They're better off not winning the Western
Conference, because that would have brought them the red-hot Dallas
Mavericks in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs' skyline is altered, and without Robinson their whole
approach is out of whack.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson's prospects don't look good. As Spur Coach Gregg Popovich
said when discussing Robinson's availability for any potential
upcoming games: "He's doubtful for Friday. He's doubtful for Sunday.
He's just doubtful. If it was looking good, he'd be here. He didn't
even make the trip."</TE>
<TE>   If Robinson does return to face the Lakers, a couple of games'
worth of poundings from Shaquille O'Neal should have him running to
the chiropractor.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily it would be fun to see if Duncan, who is expected to
rejoin the Spurs for Game 5, could carry a team. It really isn't fair
to ask him to do that while still mourning the loss of his father.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan always played with a detached efficiency. It probably has
cost him endorsement opportunities over the years, but it might serve
him well now.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim Duncan is a mature young man, as we all know," Popovich said.
"I think he'll be able to get back to the task at hand very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Duncan can ride to the rescue, the Spurs will then have to
play Game 1 against the Lakers as their third game in their third
city in five days. Not an ideal way to start a series against the
well-rested champions.</TE>
<TE>   But they might not even get the opportunity. The SuperSonics did
win Game 2 at the Alamodome, so they are capable of winning in San
Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the SuperSonics could advance to the second round while many
fans are still trying to figure out what they're doing in the
playoffs in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe this should stand as a tribute, once and for all, to Gary
Payton.</TE>
<TE>   As the SuperSonic public address announcer tells the fans during
pregame introductions, it's time to "Show your love for The Glove."</TE>
<TE>   Payton can weave his way through defenses, he can find the open
man, he can make shots from all over the court and he can defend. Is
there anything else you want from a point guard?</TE>
<TE>   The only point guard in the playoffs who I'd consider taking ahead
of Payton is Baron Davis. And I'm not taking any calls or e-mails on
Jason Kidd. Would you rather have Payton or Kidd take a shot to win a
game?</TE>
<TE>   Payton had a triple-double Wednesday with 28 points, 12 rebounds
and 11 assists</TE>
<TE>   Payton is the main reason the SuperSonics have played the Lakers
so well in recent seasons. Long before Ruben Patterson proclaimed
himself the "Kobe Stopper", Payton was the Kobe Killer, wearing out
Kobe Bryant on offense and wrapping him up on defense. He reduced
Kobe and Shaq to just Shaq, and not even O'Neal can do it all by
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant closed the gap as he matured. And there have been signs
that Payton is losing a half step defensively at age 33, even though
he was just selected to the all-defensive team for the ninth
consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   I had never seen Payton struggle defensively the way he did in
Game 3 against Tony Parker. Parker went around him for 23 points.
Payton's dad, watching from the stands, pondered giving his son a
whippin'.</TE>
<TE>   Payton didn't consume too much energy trying to shut down Parker
in Game 4. He switched off screens and gave the duties to someone
else, even if it meant Payton had to battle the likes of Malik Rose
in the low post.</TE>
<TE>   With the Spurs starting a frontline of Rose, Bruce Bowen and Mark
Bryant (none taller than 6-foot-9), you might think Seattle's 6-11
Vin Baker would see this as an opportunity to return to his All-Star
form. That's only if you hadn't recognized how completely Krispy
Kremey Baker has become. He didn't go to the basket aggressively, he
just spun and took fall-away jump shots and finished with 10 points.</TE>
<TE>   But the SuperSonics didn't have to pound the ball inside, not with
Payton creating enough open spaces for them to make eight three-point
baskets.</TE>
<TE>   Vladimir Radmanovic made six of them, including all five he
attempted in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan had played every game for the Spurs the last two seasons,
so they weren't used to his absence.</TE>
<TE>   With Robinson looking more and more ready for retirement and
Duncan a free agent after next season, Game 4 could be a sneak peek
of life without them for the Spurs. It wasn't pretty. It looked like
the Ghost of Christmas Future, giving Scrooge the bleak preview of
what's to come.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't have a viable low-post option. They missed that
almost-instinctive high-low passing from Duncan to Robinson, or
vice-versa. Without the big guys to draw in defenses the open
three-point shots they enjoyed throughout the season were absent.</TE>

<HD>Dye Getting Back in Swing of Things</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jermaine Dye admits his swing is still not quite right. Even so, the
Oakland Athletics liked what they saw from him Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Dye hit his first home run since shattering his left leg last
season and the Athletics beat Mike Mussina for the second time in a
week, defeating the Yankees, 4-1, at New York.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a long road back," Dye said. "I'm just happy to be back
in the lineup."</LD>
<TE>   Erik Hiljus (3-1) struck out nine in five innings before the
bullpen got busy, pitching the Athletics to their fifth victory in
six games.</TE>
<TE>   Dye hit a wicked line drive the opposite way into the right-field
seats in the third. He received hearty congratulations in the A's
dugout after his solo homer made it 3-0, and for good reason.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Dye sparked the Athletics to the wild-card playoff
berth, hitting 13 homers with 59 runs batted in in 61 games after
going from Kansas City to Oakland in a three-team trade.</TE>
<TE>   But Dye crumpled to the ground after fouling a ball off himself in
Game 4 in the first round of the playoffs against the Yankees. The
former All-Star and Gold Glove outfielder spent the off-season and
spring training trying to recover from the badly broken leg.</TE>
<TE>   "We know what he can do," Oakland Manager Art Howe said. "We were
just biding our time, waiting for him to get healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 9, Seattle 2--Jon Garland won his fourth consecutive
start, and Royce Clayton and Carlos Lee homered at Chicago as the
White Sox waited through four rain delays and defeated the Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   The game was called after eight innings after the fourth delay,
which lasted 30 minutes. The delays lasted a total of 2 hours 3
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Garland (4-1) pitched five shutout innings, giving up only three
hits on a wet, windy and cold night at Comiskey Park, where the
game-time temperature was 48 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 15, Baltimore 3--Manny Ramirez homered twice, and Jose
Offerman went four for four to salvage another rough outing at Fenway
Park for Pedro Martinez and lead the Red Sox over the Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (4-0) gave up three runs in five innings, including six
hits and two walks while striking out five. He is 1-0 with a 9.45
earned-run average in three starts at home this year, and 3-0 with a
0.00 ERA in three road starts.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 7, Kansas City 6--Shane Halter hit a three-run homer and
Wendell Magee had three hits and two RBIs, including a go-ahead
single in the seventh off Cory Bailey (0-3) at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit (9-17), which had held a share of the AL Central cellar
since the start of the season, moved past Kansas City (8-17), which
dropped to 0-2 under interim Manager John Mizerock.</TE>
<TE>   Jamie Walker (1-0) pitched 11/3 scoreless innings, and Juan
Acevedo got six outs for Detroit's first save this season.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 8, Toronto 1--Dave Burba (2-0) pitched a four-hitter at
Toronto for his first complete game since last June 23 and struck out
nine, extending the Ranger winning streak to a season-high four.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Greer went four for five and Alex Rodriguez hit his 10th
homer and drove in three runs. Toronto has lost seven in a row, its
longest slide since Aug. 12-18, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Tampa Bay 3--Tom Prince hit a two-run homer at
Minneapolis to back Rick Reed (3-1), who struck out seven--his most
in 18 starts for Minnesota. Reed gave up three runs and eight hits in
six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Vaughn ended an 0-for-34 slump with a double and a single for
Tampa Bay--raising his average 17 points to .116. He is homerless in
a career-high 174 at-bats since last Aug. 5 against Chicago.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal, Bryant Are All-NBA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal was named to the All-NBA first team for the fourth
time and Kobe Bryant made it for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   They are the first teammates so honored since Michael Jordan and
Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls in 1996, and the first Lakers
since Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1986.</LD>
<LD>   San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Orlando's Tracy McGrady were named to
the first-team frontcourt and New Jersey's Jason Kidd joined Bryant
in the backcourt.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal was a first-teamer on 125 of 126 ballots. The 126th was a
third-team vote, inexplicably. O'Neal did not seem much bothered by
it, though two years ago he was just as close to a unanimous most
valuable player and he still occasionally mentions the slight.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's first appearance in the top five was more newsworthy,
though Bryant reacted with typical cool.</TE>
<TE>   "I put in a lot of hard work, a lot of sweat," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Twice a second-team player, Bryant, 23, averaged 25.5 points, 5.5
rebounds and 5.5 assists in his sixth season. Teammates often
marveled at Bryant's selfless play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of him," O'Neal said. "He's come a long way."</TE>
<TE>   There have been three other sets of All-NBA first-team players for
the Lakers. Beyond the Johnson-Abdul-Jabbar set, West and Elgin
Baylor were named together four times in the 1960s, and George Mikan
and Jim Pollard were named together in 1949 and 1950 for the
Minneapolis Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not necessarily by statistics," forward Rick Fox said of the
O'Neal-Bryant honor. "You look at their complete games. There's a
reason why we're back-to-back champions, and they're it."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yao Ming appeared to impress most of the 65 NBA scouts, coaches
and team officials in Chicago to watch a pre-draft workout for the
7-foot-5 center considered to be the best player from China.</TE>
<TE>   "For a guy this size, he can shoot the ball. He has a wonderful
feel for the game," said Jerry West, the Memphis Grizzlies' new
president.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a kid without talent. He has talent."</TE>
<TE>   Yao, 21, dunked and blocked a few shots. He moved well and had a
smooth outside shot.</TE>

<LD>Confidence breeds laughter, and Jarrod Washburn laughed in the face
of his manager Wednesday. With the Angels leading comfortably, eight
outs away from another victory, Mike Scioscia headed to the mound to
check on his starting pitcher. The television audience could see
Washburn cracking up.</LD>
<LD>   "I just threw a strike," Washburn said later. "What more does he
want?"</LD>
<LD>   Over the past couple of weeks, Washburn has been nagged by
occasional tightness in his left arm, and Scioscia wanted to check
whether the condition had flared anew. It hadn't, and Washburn
insists he is fine. So are the Angels, who extended their winning
streak to six with a 7-2 victory over the Cleveland Indians.</LD>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer, starting to put the "hitter" into designated hitter,
doubled and tripled to spark an Angel offense that produced 11 hits
Wednesday and has outscored opponents, 61-19, during the winning
streak. The Angels converted three Cleveland errors into three
unearned runs, as the formerly mighty Indians lost for the 13th time
in 15 games before 23,536, the smallest crowd in Jacobs Field
history.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels extend no sympathy to the Indians. The Angels had their
own litany of problems not so long ago, but they appear to have
resolved them in concert, in the process hacking their deficit in the
American League West from 101/2 to 51/2 games in a week.</TE>
<TE>   The hitters are hitting. Fullmer, Darin Erstad and Adam Kennedy,
all of whom started play with a batting average below .250, each had
two hits. But, more importantly to the Angels, the pitchers are
pitching in, with a 2.29 earned-run average during the winning
streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels built their team upon a foundation of starting
pitching. In six of the past seven games, the starter has pitched
into the seventh inning; in the other, Aaron Sele pitched into the
sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "What I like happening is what's on the pitcher's mound," Scioscia
said. "That's where it begins for our club."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "We are definitely starting to pitch the way we're
supposed to."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was not overpowering, but he more than earned his keep in
the fifth inning. With the Angels leading, 4-1, the Indians loaded
the bases with none out. They scored once, as he retired the next
three hitters--Omar Vizquel on a sacrifice fly, Travis Fryman on a
pop fly and Jim Thome on a strikeout.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn completed the seventh inning for the first time in six
starts this season, retiring the final nine batters he faced. He won
his third consecutive start, giving up five hits over seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer did not hit a home run in April, the first time in his
career that an entire month passed without him hitting one. But the
power is starting to show up, with four extra-base hits in his past
four games. The batting average is up too, from .183 to .225 in a
week.</TE>
<TE>   "I've hit some balls hard the past few games," Fullmer said. "It
doesn't mean I'm where I want to be, but it's a step in the right
direction.</TE>
<TE>   "Home runs are the furthest thing from my mind. Worrying about
home runs will prolong problems at the plate. That I know for sure.
If I hit the ball hard, that will take care of itself. I need to make
sure that's not on my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone was overly worried about statistics. Scioscia
spent Wednesday afternoon checking out the Jimi Hendrix exhibit at
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Washburn scurried back to the hotel
after the game to place an early morning wake-up call for Ramon
Ortiz. Turns out that Ortiz had promised Washburn that, if he won
Wednesday, Ortiz would join him on a fishing trip this morning.</TE>
<TE>   In a winning streak, life is good indeed.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be interested to see how well he handles the fly rod,"
Washburn said with a smile.</TE>

<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>In troubled times, the ballpark offers Chuck Finley a place of
sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   "I come here and everything goes away for a couple hours," he said
wistfully.</LD>
<LD>   He faces his old teammates tonight, for the first time this
season. He was scheduled to start in Anaheim April 3, the day before
he filed for divorce from wife Tawny Kitaen and two days after police
responded to a domestic violence call at the family home. Kitaen
pleaded innocent this week to two counts of misdemeanor battery and
spousal abuse.</LD>
<TE>   Finley said he is grateful for the support of the Cleveland
Indians and in particular General Manager Mark Shapiro, who told him
to take as much time as needed to attend to legal matters and the
care of his two daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, 39, is in the final season of a three-year, $27-million
contract with the Indians. Life after baseball is rapidly
approaching.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't sure whether he wants to play next season, but he says he
would only play for a contender--"I wouldn't go into a situation
where they're rebuilding. I've been through too much of that"--and
would probably not consider a return to the Angels, even though he
still lives in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I'd really feel comfortable going back there," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   However, he said he would consider working for the Angels after he
retires in any number of capacities that would not require extensive
travel--assisting in the front office, working with pitchers and
such.</TE>
<TE>   Finley won 165 games for the Angels, a franchise record. In 14
seasons in Anaheim, he was a five-time All-Star. But on Oct. 11,
2001, he did something he never did for the Angels. He started a
playoff game, for the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is everything they sold me on--winning team, great
fans," he said. "That's what I wanted. That's what I needed. I wanted
to go somewhere where they were ready to win. I got to have that
feeling of what it was like to win a division and keep playing two
more days."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels swapped reserve outfielders, sending Jeff DaVanon to
triple-A Salt Lake and promoting Julio Ramirez from Salt Lake.
DaVanon hit .167 in 16 games with the Angels. Ramirez, released by
the Chicago White Sox in spring training, hit .103 in 37 previous
major league games with the White Sox and Florida Marlins.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Objects, but Sits Out Start</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over his vehement objections, Randy Johnson missed his first
scheduled start in nearly two years on Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   A lower back strain prevented the 38-year-old left-hander from
going to the mound in an attempt to go 7-0. Todd Stottlemyre started
in Johnson's place in the second game of a three-game series against
the New York Mets at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "Last night Randy initially was adamant that he was going to pitch
today," Manager Bob Brenly said before Wednesday night's game, "but
we all feel there's not enough upside to risk losing him for an
extended period of time."</LD>
<TE>   Johnson first reported stiffness in his lower back on Saturday,
the morning after his last start in Florida, when he tied a major
league record he already shared by going 6-0 in April.</TE>
<TE>   The condition worsened Sunday, and he was unable to throw his
scheduled side session on Monday. He said the back had improved
considerably after treatment on Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was overruled by Brenly, team physician Dr. Michael Lee,
pitching coach Chuck Kniffin and trainer Paul Lessard.</TE>
<TE>   "You know the phrase 'If looks could kill?'" Lessard said. "Well,
there'd be four dead people here."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal right-hander Garrett Stephenson was scratched
from his scheduled start because of lingering concerns that he has
not fully recovered from a lower back injury....Texas Ranger
right-hander Jeff Zimmerman underwent successful arthroscopic surgery
on his right elbow. The Rangers hope Zimmerman will be able to begin
a throwing program in three weeks.... The Pittsburgh Pirates
purchased the contract of right-hander Josias Manzanillo from
triple-A Nashville and designated infielder Mendy Lopez for
assignment.... Pitcher Bryan Rekar was sent outright to triple-A
Omaha by the Kansas City Royals, who purchased the contract of
catcher Juan Brito.... The Detroit Tigers will put closer Matt
Anderson on the 15-day disabled list today with a stiff shoulder....
The Cardinals, who already have five starting pitchers on the
disabled list, are expected to add injured reliever Steve Kline to
the list because of a triceps injury....Florida Marlin right-hander
Josh Beckett, who has a large blister on the middle finger of his
pitching hand, was put on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to
Monday.</TE>

<HD>Prep Star Tries to Shed His Past</HD>
<DH>Basketball: In declaring for NBA draft, 6-foot-10 DeAngelo
Collins of Inglewood High possesses guard's skills--and a litany of
transgressions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NBA has picked up another potential draft pick, this one a
troubled high school player who may not have had another attractive
option.</LD>
<LD>   DeAngelo Collins, a controversial 6-foot-10 post player at
Inglewood High with a guard's quickness and shooting range, declared
his availability for the June draft and announced he had hired an
agent Wednesday during a news conference at the school.</LD>
<LD>   Collins is projected to go late in the first round of the draft,
but the team that takes him will be taking a chance not only that the
McDonald's All-American can make the jump as a 19-year-old, but also
that he can be a good citizen.</LD>
<TE>   A little more than three years ago, as a freshman at Tustin High,
Collins inflicted permanent head injuries and a fractured nose that
required surgery when he beat up a teammate. Collins pleaded guilty
to felony assault and served six months in juvenile hall. He was also
assessed a civil fine of $35,000, a sum that remains uncollected.</TE>
<TE>   At age 13, he assaulted a woman with a deadly weapon in his
Stockton hometown and served 60 days in a juvenile detention center,
court records show.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, following an altercation with a group of boys, Collins
moved to Southern California. Shuffling between guardians for a span
of more than two years, he moved between several homes in Los
Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.</TE>
<TE>   While attending Tustin, Collins committed 27 documented
transgressions in a seven-month span, earning a series of detentions
and suspensions. One of his caretakers, youth basketball coach Bob
Gottlieb, said Collins exhibited a "vicious" temper, prompting his
expulsion from the house.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after assaulting his Tustin teammate, Collins dropped out
of school and moved in with an aunt in Inglewood. His mother, Loretta
Marie Taylor, a truck driver and single parent, also relocated there
from Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   Collins enrolled at Inglewood High, where those close to him say
he has reinvented himself over the last three years while playing
basketball in the shadow of the Great Western Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made a miraculous change to the person he is today,"
Inglewood Coach Patrick Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Taylor: "He's responsible, he's caring. You had to know him
to see the changes today. He's come a long way."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is convinced. Paul Pinto, the assault victim's
father, said Collins remains a menace, no matter what his coaches and
family say.</TE>
<TE>   "DeAngelo Collins is a sick kid," Pinto said. "He has a violent
temper and because he gets away with what he does, there's no
accountability."</TE>
<TE>   Roy said he demands accountability. He also acknowledges there
have been slip-ups--he said his star player has missed classes and
occasionally exhibits a surly attitude.</TE>
<TE>   But that, he said, is the extent of it.</TE>
<TE>   "In three years, I've never had a major problem out of him," Roy
said. "I think the worst thing I had to counsel him on was being late
to class. Fights and anything like that--he's never exemplified any
of that behavior with me."</TE>
<TE>   Those close to Collins say the biggest influence in his turnaround
has been Roy, who has a reputation as an even-handed but firm leader
of a program he has been associated with since playing guard there in
the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Pat Roy has been a stabilizing figure for him as a coach
and a father figure," said Dinos Trigonis, a travel ball coach who
has known Collins since he moved to Southern California in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Collins said Roy kept on him every day, telling him to "go to
class. Make sure you do this. Go to the library."</TE>
<TE>   Roy said Collins' turnaround lost some momentum when he left
school during his sophomore year to serve his assault sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "When he came back," Roy said, "it was almost like starting over
again because he was bitter."</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, Roy said Collins' transformation is most visible on
the court.</TE>
<TE>   "As a 10th grader he would just go for himself. As a senior, he
would try to get his teammates going even if he was having a bad
game. That's the dramatic change I've seen in him over the years."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor also credited Inglewood teachers and administrators.</TE>
<TE>   "They disciplined him from the start," she said. "[It's as if they
said], 'When you attend this school, it's going to be this way, and
this way only. You're here to learn, we're here to teach.</TE>
<TE>   "'If you're not here to learn, there's the door.'"</TE>
<TE>   Collins' best performance on the court came last season when he
averaged 23 points, 15 rebounds and four blocks. But he missed 12
games after suffering a knee injury midway through the season.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Roy said Collins is the second-best player he has
coached in 10 years at Inglewood, behind Paul Pierce, the Boston
Celtics' all-star guard.</TE>
<TE>   By retaining an agent, Collins decided not to take advantage of
the NCAA's recent ruling that allows undrafted players--and drafted
players who later decide they don't want to enter the NBA--to
maintain college eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   "To go to the NBA, you have to have confidence," Collins said.
"Not having an agent wouldn't show confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Collins' agent is Michael T. Harrison of Santa Monica-based
Immortal Sports &amp; Entertainment, whose only NBA client is Portland
Trail Blazer rookie Zach Randolph, a seldom-used forward who averaged
2.8 points this season.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether college was even an option for Collins, who
tested at a third-grade reading level in the eighth grade.</TE>
<TE>   Roy said Collins was on track to graduate with his class but had
not received his SAT scores after taking the test recently for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   Some think Collins would have been better served by spending a
year or two in college.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perfect world, DeAngelo should go to college.... Would it
help him on and off the court? Yes," said Sonny Vaccaro, the Adidas
consultant who has tracked Collins' progress since last summer, when
he was selected MVP of the shoe company's prestigious high school
all-star game.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Collins has declared for the draft, NBA teams will begin
the process of fully investigating his background.</TE>
<TE>   What will he tell league personnel when they ask about his
freshman year?</TE>
<TE>   "They'll know when they ask me," Collins said. "I'm not going to
sit here and say what my answer will be because I don't do it like
that. When we talk, I'll tell them the whole story about what
happened."</TE>
<TE>   But he wouldn't tell that story Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get on that right now because I feel like that's
bringing up negativity," he said. "I feel like this is a positive day
for me. I just want to leave it at that."</TE>
<TE>   Roy said he's already broached Collins' past in conversations with
officials from more than a dozen NBA teams.</TE>
<TE>   He knows the issue is a concern, especially considering the money
teams invest in first-round picks.</TE>
<TE>   "Will they hold his past against him?" Roy asked, repeating a
question. "Some will and some won't. But those who have done their
homework, been to practice and understand who he is and how he
represents himself, it definitely won't matter to them."</TE>
<TE>   Said Trigonis: "He's made a big stride this year maturity-wise....
I think he's aware he has an opportunity now, and he better not mess
up."</TE>

<TE>   Early Entrants</TE>
<TE>   Since Kevin Garnett's successful transition from the high school
ranks to the NBA, the nation's top high school basketball players
have considered skipping college in increasing numbers, with varying
results among those who made the jump. The 19 players who have
applied for the draft out of high school, and how they have fared:</TE>
<TE>   IMMEDIATE FIT</TE>
<TE>   * Kevin Garnett (1995, No. 5, Minnesota)</TE>
<TE>   * Kobe Bryant (1996, No. 13, Charlotte, traded to Lakers)</TE>
<TE>   * Darius Miles (2000, No. 3, Clippers)</TE>
<TE>   The role model for the new generation of young hopefuls, Garnett
took to the pro game right away and continues to improve, averaging
18.9 points per game in his seven-year career, twice being named to
the All-NBA first team. Bryant didn't become a starter until his
third season, but was averaging more than 15 points a game by his
second season. Miles, with plenty of room for development, has still
been an impact player in each of his first two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   WELL DEVELOPED</TE>
<TE>   * Jermaine O'Neal (1996, No. 17, Portland)</TE>
<TE>   * Tracy McGrady (1997, No. 9, Toronto)</TE>
<TE>   * Rashard Lewis (1998, No. 32, Seattle)</TE>
<TE>   After four years of development on Portland's time, O'Neal has
become a star in Indiana, where he was named the NBA's most improved
player this season. McGrady struggled as a rookie and didn't blossom
until his third season with the Raptors; now he's a first-team
all-NBA performer with Orlando. Lewis had a forgettable rookie year,
but by his third season he was one of the SuperSonics' standouts.</TE>
<TE>   STILL DEVELOPING</TE>
<TE>   * Al Harrington (1998, No. 25, Indiana)</TE>
<TE>   * Jonathan Bender (1999, No. 5, Toronto, traded to Indiana)</TE>
<TE>   The Pacers have tried to bring their young front line along
slowly, with mixed results. Harrington was having a breakout season
with a 13.1-point average before an injury ended his season after 44
games. Statistically, Bender was at the same point this season that
Harrington was in his third year.</TE>
<TE>   CLASS OF 2001</TE>
<TE>   * Kwame Brown (2001, No. 1, Washington)</TE>
<TE>   * Tyson Chandler (2001, No. 2, Clippers, traded to Chicago)</TE>
<TE>   * Eddy Curry (2001, No. 4, Chicago)</TE>
<TE>   * DeSagana Diop (2001, No. 8, Cleveland)</TE>
<TE>   * Ousmane Cisse (2001, No. 47, Denver)</TE>
<TE>   Chandler and Curry, the Bulls' latest building blocks, got a boost
in playing time after a coaching change midway through the season and
finished with an average of 13 points a game between them. Brown,
despite the opportunity to play with Michael Jordan, averaged only
4.5 points. Diop got only limited playing time. Cisse failed his
physical in Denver, is now a free agent and has yet to play a game in
the league.</TE>
<TE>   PROBLEM CASES</TE>
<TE>   * Leon Smith (1999, No. 29, San Antonio, traded to Dallas)</TE>
<TE>   * DeShawn Stevenson (2000, No. 23, Utah)</TE>
<TE>   Smith had discipline problems with Dallas and run-ins with the law
in his hometown of Chicago, before attempting to commit suicide by
swallowing more than 200 aspirin. He worked out his personal problems
and his strong season in the CBA earned him another shot at the NBA
late this season, with Atlanta. Stevenson has continued to develop on
court despite having to deal with a misdemeanor charge of statutory
rape that resulted in probation.</TE>
<TE>   WASHOUTS</TE>
<TE>   * Taj McDavid (1996, not drafted)</TE>
<TE>   * Ellis Richardson (1998, not drafted)</TE>
<TE>   * Korleone Young (1998, No. 40, Detroit)</TE>
<TE>   * Tony Key (2001, not drafted)</TE>
<TE>   The highly touted Young proved a major disappointment, missing
almost all of his rookie season with back problems before ending up
in the minor leagues.</TE>

<HD>Draw for the Derby Proves to Be Lively Affair</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Owner of Windward Passage is upset over
Baffert's late entry. Harlan's Holiday is installed as 9-2 favorite.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Bob Lively, one of the owners of Windward Passage, left the Kentucky
Derby Museum even before Wednesday's post-position draw, his
premature departure unrelated to the darkening skies, flashes of
lightning and tornado watch for the Louisville area.</LD>
<LD>   Lively, incensed that Danthebluegrassman, the last-place finisher
in the Santa Anita Derby and trained by Bob Baffert, had become an
11th-hour entry for Saturday's Kentucky Derby, thereby precluding
Windward Passage from running, seemed to be forming a funnel of his
own as he marched toward the parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   "Where did [Danthebluegrassman] finish at Santa Anita?" Lively
said, not expecting an answer. "I don't think he even finished the
race. He'll go off at 99-1 in the Derby. They've got no business
running, and to wait until the last minute to decide is an insult to
all of the people, partners included, who are in town to see my horse
run."</LD>
<TE>   With more than the 20-horse Derby maximum hoping to run,
repercussions were inevitable. The nationally televised draw, instead
of focusing on the horses that are running, highlighted the ones that
are out.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday morning, trainer Patrick Biancone announced that
Mayakovsky wouldn't run, which appeared to clear the way for Windward
Passage. Winner of the Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park and a dead-heat
third-place finisher in the Arkansas Derby, Windward Passage also
would have been a Kentucky Derby longshot, though not as high as
Danthebluegrassman, who is listed at 50-1, tied with three others for
the high price on the morning line.</TE>
<TE>   The most important horse that didn't get in was Sunday Break, a
close third-place finisher in the Wood Memorial. He would have been
rated at 10-1 or 12-1--the sixth choice--by Mike Battaglia, the
Churchill Downs linemaker.</TE>
<TE>   When the Derby is over-subscribed, Churchill determines the 20
starters by the highest career earnings in graded stakes races.
Windward Passage was tied with Wild Horses for the No. 20 spot, each
horse having $100,000, but Wild Horses was declared a starter because
of the tiebreaker--most purses in non-graded stakes. Besides Sunday
Break and Windward Passage, other potential starters not making the
cut were U S S Tinosa and Straight Gin.</TE>
<TE>   Battaglia made Harlan's Holiday, the Blue Grass and Florida Derby
winner, the 9-2 favorite, followed by Wood Memorial winner Buddha and
Santa Anita Derby winner Came Home, both 5-1; and the Irish-based
Johannesburg, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, and Medaglia
d'Oro, second in the Wood, each at 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Battaglia said that he made his line before the post positions
were drawn and didn't change the numbers afterward. Harlan's Holiday,
whose trainer, Ken McPeek, was the seventh horseman in line as
Churchill's racing office conducted the order of the draw by lot,
chose No. 14, the last stall in the main starting gate. Horses in
stalls 15 through 20 will break from an auxiliary gate.</TE>
<TE>   Starting from the auxiliary gate used to be considered a
disadvantage, but in five of the last seven years the Derby winner
has come from either No. 15 or No. 16. The last time 20 horses ran in
the Derby, in 1984, Swale won from the 15 hole.</TE>
<TE>   Of the other favorites, Buddha, with trainer James Bond getting
the first pick, will break from No. 10; Came Home has 15, Medaglia
d'Oro 9 and Johannesburg the inside. Only one horse--Ferdinand in
1986--has won from the No. 1 post in the last 38 years.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Pegram, the owner of Danthebluegrassman and winner of the
1998 Derby with Real Quiet, said that the decision to run his colt
was made by Baffert, after a sharp workout Tuesday. Jorge Chavez got
off Danthebluegrassman after a 1:114/5 clocking for six furlongs and
reportedly said: "This horse ought to be in the Derby."</TE>
<TE>   Baffert and Pegram discussed the options at dinner Tuesday night,
and when Baffert found Wednesday morning that Danthebluegrassman
bounced back well from the workout, he green lighted the colt. But
word of Danthebluegrassman's entry didn't leak out until shortly
before the draw. Windward Passage's trainer, Steve Asmussen, had
waited until Wednesday to hire Richard Migliore to ride his horse.
Baffert was able to sign up Kent Desormeaux, who rode Real Quiet and
also won the 2000 Derby with Fusaichi Pegasus. Desormeaux became
available when U S S Tinosa was unable to draw into the field.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised that Bob even brought the horse here after the
Santa Anita Derby," Pegram said. "But he broke bad and had a horrible
trip that day, a trip that he brought on himself. He's trained well
and kept on getting better. I'm not going to apologize for running.
You play the hand you're dealt with."</TE>
<TE>   The year before Real Quiet, Baffert won the Derby with Silver
Charm. In 1998, Indian Charlie, also trained by Baffert, went off at
5-2 and Real Quiet was 8-1. Indian Charlie finished third.</TE>
<TE>   "Danthebluegrassman was still full of himself after that workout,"
Baffert said. "A lot of my second-stringers end up beating my
first-stringers."</TE>
<TE>   After the Santa Anita Derby, Baffert seemed to have no hope of
having a Derby starter. He announced that Danthebluegrassman would
probably run in the Lone Star Derby on May 11 in Texas. But now
Baffert will have two starters, Danthebluegrassman joining War
Emblem, who was bought, for a reported $1 million for the controlling
interest, by Prince Ahmed Salman, Baffert's richest client. War
Emblem won the Illinois Derby on April 6.</TE>
<TE>   At entry time, trainer Aidan O'Brien made a flip-flop of jockeys
for his horses.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Stevens will ride Johannesburg instead of Jerry Bailey, and
Bailey will have the assignment on Castle Gandolfo. Mick Kinane,
who's ridden Johannesburg in all eight of his races--seven wins--is
unavailable because he's serving a seven-day suspension in England.</TE>
<TE>   The forecast is for scattered showers today, dry Friday and then a
chance of morning showers Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The high temperature Saturday is expected to be 75 degrees, with a
fast track likely.</TE>
<TE>   Bella Bellucci, the 3-1 second choice for Friday's Kentucky Oaks,
won't run because of a bad blood test.</TE>

<HD>Dodger Sum Game Is Zero</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Nomo surrenders two home runs and L.A. is shut
out for fifth time this season, 4-0, by the Reds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What's that old saying, be careful what you wish for? Dodger pitching
coach Jim Colborn was probably mumbling that to himself a few times
on the bench Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Colborn, concerned that Dodger pitcher Hideo Nomo had walked 15
and hit a batter in his previous three losses, urged the Japanese
right-hander to challenge hitters more, "even if that means
sacrificing three solo home runs," Colborn said.</LD>
<LD>   The Cincinnati Reds were up for the challenge.</LD>
<TE>   Nomo walked only two in eight innings Wednesday night, limiting
the Reds to four hits and striking out a season-high 10, but he gave
up two costly solo home runs in a 4-0 loss before 23,346 in Dodger
Stadium, the fifth time this season the Dodgers have been shut out
and the third time they've been blanked in games Nomo started.</TE>
<TE>   Reds' right-hander Joey Hamilton, who was slowed by shoulder
injuries the last three seasons, continued his strong comeback with
71/3 shutout innings, giving up six hits and striking out seven to
improve to 9-2 with a 2.31 earned-run average in 16 career
appearances against the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton did not improve to 2-1 without a Reds' scare in the
eighth, though. The Dodgers loaded the bases on pinch-hitter Alex
Cora's single off Hamilton and two-out singles by Cesar Izturis and
Paul Lo Duca against reliever Gabe White.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped cleanup batter Shawn Green, representing the tying run,
and White fell behind, 3-and-1, on the count. But White got Green to
tap weakly to first on a breaking pitch, ending the Dodger threat.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers outhit Cincinnati, 8-5, the second straight night the
Dodgers had more hits in a loss to the Reds, but the heart of the
Dodger order--Lo Duca, Green and Brian Jordan--combined to go three
for 23 in the two games.</TE>
<TE>   "You need production from the middle of the order; it's that
simple," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said. "That's the one thing holding
this club up, in my opinion. We're pitching well, playing solid
defense, running the bases well, getting on base at the top of the
order and getting production from the bottom of the order.</TE>
<TE>   "But you need run-scoring hits in the middle of the order. We're
tied for first place, but we could have 19 or 20 wins with a good
at-bat here or there."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, who has a 2.56 ERA, could also be 5-1 instead of 2-4 with a
little run support, but the Dodgers have scored only 10 runs in his
six starts.</TE>
<TE>   "Nomo has exceeded our expectations to this point," Tracy said.
"You can't ask a guy to pitch much better than he did tonight. We
just haven't applied enough offensive pressure to see if the other
guy is good enough to pitch out of jams."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo ran into immediate trouble Wednesday night when Cincinnati
shortstop Barry Larkin opened the game by sending a 2-1 Nomo pitch
into the left-field pavilion, his seventh career leadoff home run and
first since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Encarnacion led off the fourth by blasting a 1-0 pitch into
the left-field seats for his seventh homer of the season and a 2-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Encarnacion, who is finally blossoming into the all-around player
the Detroit Tigers envisioned before trading the underachieving
outfielder to the Reds for Dmitri Young in December, also came up
with the defensive play of the game in the third.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers loaded the bases with one out--their only real scoring
chance against Hamilton--on Mark Grudzielanek's single, Dave Roberts'
single and Larkin's error on Izturis' grounder up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca, who grounded into a key bases-loaded double play in the
fifth inning of Tuesday night's 3-1 loss to the Reds, lofted a fly
ball to medium right, and Grudzielanek tagged up.</TE>
<TE>   But Encarnacion made a strong one-hop throw to the plate, and
catcher Jason LaRue slapped the tag on Grudzielanek for an
inning-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo, who failed to lay down a sacrifice bunt in the third, also
contributed to Cincinnati's two-run sixth. Hamilton led off with a
single to center, and Larkin doubled to left, advancing Hamilton to
third.</TE>
<TE>   Encarnacion grounded to third, Hamilton and Larkin holding, and
Sean Casey bounced an RBI grounder to second to make it 3-0. Adam
Dunn walked, putting runners on first and third. Nomo faked a pickoff
move to third and caught Dunn in a rundown between first and second.</TE>
<TE>   When Nomo ran toward Dunn, Larkin broke for home, but Nomo spun
and threw wildly past Lo Duca, allowing Larkin to score for a 4-0
lead.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Lo Duca Finally Gets One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca has drawn rave reviews this season for
his game-calling abilities, and pitchers and coaches cite him as one
of the primary reasons the Dodgers began Wednesday night's game
against the Reds with a 2.95 earned-run average, second best in the
major leagues.</LD>
<LD>   Lo Duca has also been one of the team's most consistent offensive
players, batting .295 with nine doubles, 11 runs and nine runs batted
in, striking out only five times and walking four times in 88 at-bats
through Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   But there is one statistic deep in the Dodger daily notes package
that makes Lo Duca cringe: Runners were 13 for 13 in stolen-base
attempts against Lo Duca this season before Lo Duca threw out Barry
Larkin attempting to steal second in the eighth inning Wednesday
night.</LD>
<TE>   "That's weird, because I feel like I'm throwing the ball better
this year than I did last year," Lo Duca said. "I've made five or six
good throws near the second base bag, but guys got good jumps. On
four of the 13 [stolen bases] I didn't even make a throw. We've been
winning, so it hasn't mattered, but obviously I want to throw out
some runners. That's one of my strong points."</TE>
<TE>   Pitchers share part of the blame. Right-handers Hideo Nomo and
Kevin Brown have had problems holding runners on at times--Larkin got
such a good jump off Brown in the third inning Tuesday he stole third
without a throw. But with left-handers Odalis Perez, Kazuhisa Ishii
and Omar Daal making 12 of 27 starts, one would think the Dodgers
would do a better job holding runners.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy declined to discuss the Dodgers' run defense in
detail, "because that's personal stuff I would rather the opposition
not read about," he said. "But I can't think of any game where a
stolen base has cost us the game, so it isn't an issue right now."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Austin Kearns' left eye was discolored and almost swollen shut
Wednesday, and he had an abrasion on the left side of his nose, but
the Red outfielder survived getting hit in the head by a Giovanni
Carrara pitch Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   A CT scan on Kearns' head revealed no abnormalities, and the
swelling around the eye subsided. There was no concussion, and Kearns
was not dizzy. "I'm just happy it hit the bill of my helmet instead
of flush on my face," said Kearns, who did not play Wednesday night
and is doubtful for tonight's series finale. "Any time you get hit in
the head, it scares you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With the bases loaded, no outs and light-hitting Wilton Guerrero
up in the ninth inning Tuesday night, the Dodgers brought left
fielder Brian Jordan and center fielder Dave Roberts in, but right
fielder Shawn Green remained at regular depth. Guerrero blooped an
RBI single to shallow right, giving the Reds a key insurance run in a
3-1 victory. Several balls have dropped in shallow right this season,
an issue Tracy addressed with Green last week, but Tracy refused to
revisit the topic Wednesday. "I'm not going to beat a dead horse," he
said.... Brown, who allowed two runs on five hits in five innings in
his return from the disabled list Tuesday, experienced no discomfort
in his surgically repaired right elbow Wednesday.</TE>

<DH>Montreal: Even though they are operated by Major League
Baseball and have few fans at games, Expos are thriving on field.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>The gates have opened at Olympic Stadium, but no more than 50 people
are in the stands and fewer than a dozen are clustered around the
Montreal Expo dugout, begging for spare bats or autographs. No one is
lining up for biere (beer) or a boisson gazeuse (carbonated drink) at
the concession stands.</LD>
<LD>   It's quiet. Ghost-town quiet. A silence that resonates of sadness
and loss and happier times that will never be recaptured.</LD>
<LD>   In a deserted corridor across from a shuttered souvlaki stand,
Jackie Robinson's likeness peers down from a plaque on the Expos'
Wall of Excellence. Noting that Robinson played for the minor league
Montreal Royals before he became the first African American player in
the major leagues, the plaque features a quote from the Hall of Fame
infielder.</LD>
<TE>   This is the city for me. This is paradise.</TE>
<TE>   And it was, and not only for him.</TE>
<TE>   A vibrant city where French and English have lived for centuries
in sometimes tenuous harmony, Montreal opened its heart to the
expansion Expos in 1969. The NHL Canadiens inspired awe. The Expos,
jaunty in their red, white and blue caps, inspired affection.</TE>
<TE>   They had style and flair, featuring such stars as Coco Laboy,
Rusty Staub, Bill Stoneman, Gary Carter, Andre Dawson and Tim Raines.
Playing in a city that looks American, only cleaner, the Expos
brought a dash of foreign chic to America's pastime.</TE>
<TE>   But love was eventually trampled by money, and the Expos have been
pushed to the brink of extinction.</TE>
<TE>   A victim of fan resentment after the 1994 player strike--they led
the National League East by six games and lost a likely World Series
trip when the season was cut short--they also were hurt by
small-market financial limitations and ownership changes. Attendance
declined steeply, falling below 8,000 a game last season.</TE>
<TE>   Targeted for contraction by Major League Baseball last winter,
they got a reprieve when a grievance filed by the players' union
postponed their demise. But because baseball Commissioner Bud Selig
anticipated contraction would be approved and had allowed Expo owner
Jeffrey Loria to buy the Florida Marlins, the Expos landed in Selig's
lap, to be operated by Major League Baseball this season. After that,
they could be moved--perhaps to Washington--or dissolved.</TE>
<TE>   Just like that. Paradise lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I am always here watching them since they began, 33 years,"
retiree Pierette Turcotte said while watching batting practice last
week, a bright spot in a sea of empty seats. "They're going to leave,
and I can't tell you how much I will miss them."</TE>
<TE>   But if this is the end, the Expos are going out in style.</TE>
<TE>   Although they have little depth and their pitching is largely
unproven, their prolific hitting has lifted them atop the NL East for
20 days. Not bad, considering there's no blueprint for conducting
business while a sword hangs over your head.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sort of like a situation where you go in to see the
doctor and you're told you've got terminal cancer and you've got six
months to live," said Expo President Tony Tavares, who was recruited
by Selig in February, a month after he resigned as president of the
Angels and Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   "You can be despondent and sulk, or you can choose to celebrate
life. That's what we asked the players to do, celebrate life. And
they have. This is really all about baseball. There's almost a
baseball purity to it right now."</TE>
<TE>   Gallows humor helps too.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no five-year plan here," said General Manager Omar
Minaya, a Dominican native and baseball's first Latino GM. "This is
not like one of those situations where we're going to trade for some
young players. We're about trying to win now and win as many games as
possible."</TE>
<TE>   They won six in a row in mid-April before losing two of three to
St. Louis and slipping into a tie for first with the New York Mets.
They're winning because of the bat of right fielder Vladimir
Guerrero, who's on target to exceed the 118 runs batted in he
averaged the last four seasons and is among the NL leaders with a
.383 batting average. Second baseman Jose Vidro (.318) and catcher
Michael Barrett (.370), like Guerrero a product of Montreal's superb
scouting and development system, have established themselves as core
players.</TE>
<TE>   "There's really not a ton of pressure because we're not expected
to do anything," Tavares said. "This reminds me of the early days of
the Ducks, from the standpoint that we didn't have a lot of time to
put this together. No one got hung up on a title or a role. Everybody
pitched in. That's how it is up here."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Robinson, persuaded by Selig to relinquish his duties as
vice president of on-field operations for Major League Baseball and
return to managing after an 11-year absence, is impressed by his
players' demeanor.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never been around a team like this. Nothing seems to bother
them," he said. "They have something what I would kind of call
special.</TE>
<TE>   "I told myself I was going to make it be fun and I wasn't going to
let anything get me down. But the attitude of the players, from
spring training, I could see it was great. They never let the
attitude from the world outside carry over. I knew from there it was
going to be enjoyable."</TE>
<TE>   But there haven't been many fans around to enjoy it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like we walk out of the tunnel [to the field] every
night hoping there will be more fans," first baseman Lee Stevens
said. "And maybe there will be, if we keep winning and playing well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great city. As a player, you get used to moving around,
but the sad thing here is I think the fans are going to miss us. Next
spring, when the season rolls around, I hope they don't regret it."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos have drawn an average of 8,143] fans to the cavernous
stadium called "the Big Owe" for the debt its construction and the
1976 Olympics left the city. (Tavares said club executives call it
"the Orphanage," and dubbed themselves "Les Miserables.")</TE>
<TE>   Too bland and big to be cozy like Jarry Park, the Expos' first
home, Olympic Stadium echoes like a tomb between pitches. The upper
deck is cordoned off, leaving fans scattered among the yellow and
blue seats on the lower levels. Youppi!, the team's furry orange
mascot, clomps around and tries to generate enthusiasm, but it's not
easy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody believed Loria was a hero at the beginning, but he was
a crook," said Jean Claude Trottier of Montreal, sitting with friends
at a recent game. "It's all a frame-up from the owners. They're
killing the spirit here."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always this way. The Expos drew more than 2 million fans
four times and nearly 1.5 million in 1997. However, their tight
budget didn't allow them to keep their young stars, and fans became
disenchanted by the constant turnover.</TE>
<TE>   The fans who remained had to make an effort to follow them. The
Expos had no English-language radio outlet last season and have no
local TV package this season, although they're negotiating to get
some games on the air.</TE>
<TE>   "I think young people in Montreal love baseball, but it has been
tough to be an Expos fan the last few seasons," said Serge Alarie,
who makes the 90-minute drive from Trois Rivieres with his son,
Philippe, two or three times a season. "It's sad this will be the
last season for the Expos."</TE>
<TE>   Attendance traditionally has been low in April, while school and
the Canadiens' playoff run are in session.</TE>
<TE>   This season, though, poisoned by the threat of contraction, has
been the worst. The Expos drew 34,351 fans for their opener but drew
barely 3,500 at each of two weeknight games that conflicted with
Canadien playoff games during their last home stand.</TE>
<TE>   Infielder Mike Mordecai, an Alabama native who's in his fourth
season in Montreal, said players long ago decided to block out
thoughts about the team's future. He hopes fans will do the same, and
enjoy the present.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a whole lot of baseball fans here, and they're not going
to waste their time or spend their money or energy on a losing team,"
he said. "They love their hockey team here, but I've said all along
if this team starts to win, you'll see 20,000 or 25,000 people here."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos haven't surrendered to what seems inevitable. They've
cut ticket prices, let kids in for $1 on family days and scheduled
six bobblehead doll giveaways. They're also tentatively planning to
invest in a marketing campaign this month.</TE>
<TE>   It's probably too little too late. Lisa Derepentigny, who boasted
she was "born an Expo in '67," the year of the World's Fair that gave
the team its name, mourns the prospect of losing her team after the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "My boyfriend wants to take the kids to ballgames because his
father never took him to baseball games," she said. "My kids are 9
and 5 and it will be sad if they can't grow up watching the Expos."</TE>
<TE>   After thinking for a moment, she brightened. "Right now they're
doing really well," she said. "If they continue in first place, there
may be more fans, and if there are more fans, maybe the team will
stay."</TE>
<TE>   Minaya is determined to be positive, because the team's fate is
out of its hands.</TE>
<TE>   "If it is our last season," he said, "we can leave with our heads
high and know we did the best we can, not only for baseball but for
the city of Montreal."</TE>

<LD>You can say goodbye to the proposed Major Champions Tour, an idea
that lasted only a couple of months, but isn't going to make it off
the drawing board in 2003 because not enough players signed up.</LD>
<LD>   Fox, which would have been the proposed tour's television partner,
wanted at least 20 of the 35 eligible players to agree to give up
their PGA Tour cards and imposed a deadline of late this month. It's
not going to happen, television insiders say, because too many
players were wary of leaving the PGA Tour and competing against it.
Players 37 to 55 who have won a major would be eligible.</LD>
<LD>   Sources say Fox got the news Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   However, Fox also heard a lot more, so this doesn't appear to be
the end of the story. Even if there isn't going to be a Major
Champions Tour, don't be surprised to see individual MCT events in
2003 that are acceptable to the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   It's early in the planning stages, but there are proposals for MCT
events in November and December and on certain Mondays and Tuesdays
during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going away and it's not going to happen overnight, but
it's going to get on the map," according to an insider.</TE>
<TE>   If this route sounds familiar, it should. The so-called World Tour
that Greg Norman tried to get going only to be stopped by PGA Tour
Commissioner Tim Finchem eventually evolved into World Golf
Championship events sanctioned by the tour.</TE>
<TE>   The MCT would be following a similar path, but involving older
players--such as Norman, Fred Couples, Nick Faldo and Nick Price--and
representing an alternative to the routinely bland Senior PGA Tour or
some sort of partnership.</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned. Just be aware that if there's money to be made, it's
going to get the complete attention of the players, the PGA Tour and
Fox ... and it's probably coming off the drawing board to your
television set sooner than you think.</TE>
<TE>   Hootie Birdies</TE>
<TE>   How often do the decision-makers at Augusta National make
mistakes? They made one last week when they ruled that past Masters
champions would have to play at least 15 tournaments the previous
year to be eligible to play beginning in 2004--virtually assuring
that Jack Nicklaus would play his last Masters next year.</TE>
<TE>   At least club chairman Hootie Johnson knew he messed up because
the rule was changed Wednesday to 10 tournaments, clearly to
accommodate Nicklaus and avoid embarrassing the only six-time
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson didn't act like the same person who said that after a
decision he never looked back, and that's good.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of a Nicklaus wandering off was probably worth a second
look.</TE>
<TE>   More Masters</TE>
<TE>   He won the Masters three times and was runner-up twice, but now
that he has been told he will play his last Masters next year, Gary
Player doesn't want to go out quietly.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're doing, they're throwing away tradition," Player
said. "People are starting to get a little bit bitter. I do not ever
want to be bitter in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Player turns 67 in November and will be on the wrong side of the
calendar when the Masters institutes its new age policy in 2004. Past
champions must be 65 or younger and meet the 10-tournament
requirement. Player has no trouble making the tournament limit
because he regularly schedules 20 events on the Senior PGA Tour, but
there's nothing he can do about the age limit.</TE>
<TE>   He's not very happy about it, especially because he feels he can
still play.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still competitive. I could have played another two or three
years. The minute I can't play, you don't have to send me a letter.
I'm gone."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson sent letters to past champions Gay Brewer, Doug Ford and
Billy Casper before the Masters this year and informed them they
would not be allowed to play. Player said it was "inexcusable" to
communicate by letter.</TE>
<TE>   Player also called the 15-tournament limit "ridiculous," and
Johnson apparently agreed.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1990, Nicklaus has played at least 11 events every year.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, the U.S. Open has a 10-year limit on exemptions
for past champions, the British Open established its own age limit of
65 for past champions in 1984 and there is no exemption limitation
for past winners of the PGA Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Also for the record, Player has made the cut four times in his
last 17 Masters, but that's not his point, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "When I won the tournament, I was told I could play as long as I
chose. They haven't lived up to their word, that's the sad thing. The
British Open has been very clear--65 and that's it. They don't tell
you one thing and do another."</TE>
<TE>   Numbers Game</TE>
<TE>   Dana Quigley will set a record Friday when he plays in his 178th
consecutive tournament, at the Senior PGA Tour event in Birmingham,
Ala. Quigley's streak began 244 weeks ago and includes six victories,
10 seconds, 74 top 10s, 534 rounds, 39,552 strokes and $6.7 million
in earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, He Left the Tip</TE>
<TE>   News item: Aaron Baddeley rejects reports that David Leadbetter
isn't spending enough time coaching him. He reports working all day
with the famous teacher and taking only an hour break for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Who bought?</TE>

<TE>   News item: Michelle Wie, 12, the youngest player to qualify for an
LPGA event, gets a sponsor's exemption into the LPGA tournament in
North Augusta, S.C., later this month.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Yes and she's in a foursome with the cast of "Rugrats"
and the tournament will be carried live on Nickelodeon.</TE>
<TE>   Who's He Targeting?</TE>
<TE>   John Prideaux, the club secretary at Muirfield, had this to say
recently about the wind blowing at the British Open site: "That will
... test ... all those who are accustomed only to playing target golf
in the States."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it's unlikely any PGA Tour pro has a chance at the British
Open, which by the way has been won by a U.S. player seven times in
the last eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Uh, He Did</TE>
<TE>   News item: Nicklaus was two under on the front nine at

<LD>A day before the Kentucky Oaks and two days before the Kentucky
Derby, the best races in America today will be run at Churchill
Downs.</LD>
<LD>   California-based trainers and jockeys will be represented in the
$100,000 Mamzelle at five furlongs on the turf and Cashier's Dream, a
double-stakes winner as a 2-year-old, will make her first start of
the year in the $100,000 La Troienne, a Grade III, at seven furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Penny Marie, who finished third in the Mamzelle last year, is back
for another shot in 2002 for trainer Bob Hess Jr. Second in the Las
Cienegas Handicap at Santa Anita less than four weeks ago, Penny
Marie will be ridden by Kent Desormeaux, who has been aboard for the
majority of her seven lifetime victories.</LD>
<TE>   Also in the field are Fair Apache, who is trained by Chris Paasch
and will be ridden by Alex Solis, and Dyna's Club, who is trained by
Ron Ellis and will be ridden by Chris McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   A Michigan-bred owned by Bill Heiligbrodt and Barry Irwin and Jeff
Siegel's Team Valor, Cashier's Dream won the Debutante last summer at
Churchill Downs, then dominated six rivals when winning the Spinaway,
a Grade I, at Saratoga last Aug. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The field also includes Drippingindiamonds, the Bob

<HD>West's Homework Made Move Easier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The move from Bel-Air to Beale Street took a little more than two
weeks for Jerry West, who agreed Monday to become president of the
Memphis Grizzlies, a deal that brought him riches and power and, more
than any of that, something worthwhile to do.</LD>
<LD>   From start to finish--Atlanta to Memphis, as it turned out--West
and his agent, Lon Rosen, heard from 10 teams, eight of which were
deemed serious. The call from Grizzly owner Michael Heisley was one
of the last.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very interesting process," Rosen said. "What he did, as
teams would call, we would research it. In Michael Heisley's case,
Jerry wanted to know as much about the guy as possible. He met him,
he talked to people he's worked with. He did the same thing you'd do
if you were going to hire somebody, but he did it the other way. He
wanted to learn about the guy, because you hear so many things from
so many different people."</LD>
<TE>   What they found after a couple of days, according to Rosen, was a
new owner who had many of the same values that drove Dr. Jerry Buss,
the Lakers' owner.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after, Heisley flew to Los Angeles, and he and West met
at West's Bel-Air home for about four hours.</TE>
<TE>   Again, West was struck by the ideals Heisley shared with Buss, the
belief that an NBA owner could create a winner without reckless
spending, though recent top-end contracts for Jason Williams and
Michael Dickerson would suggest otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Heisley, who makes a living turning around failing businesses,
bought the Grizzlies two years ago and then moved them from Vancouver
to Memphis last summer. There's a new arena going up in downtown
Memphis, where there is corporate money--FedEx, above all--and what
appears to be a decent interest in basketball.</TE>
<TE>   West liked Heisley instantly, and their meeting was followed by
negotiations, which was followed by West's soul-searching.</TE>
<TE>   "What Jerry was looking for was what he got," said Rosen, a former
Laker intern who became an agent for Magic Johnson and Kurt Rambis,
among others. "He was looking for a guy who was committed to win and
a guy that was willing to spend the money it takes to win.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about collecting Jerry West and a new arena. This guy
wants to win at any expense. He's willing to dip into his pocket to
do it, which is very similar to what Buss did."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Rosen said, "This was a very simple negotiation.
Michael Heisley said, 'You tell me what he's looking for and I'll let
you know if I can do it.'"</TE>
<TE>   In Memphis on Tuesday afternoon, West walked into the news
conference to a standing ovation, a reaction unheard of in most
markets. Shaquille O'Neal watched clips of the event from his home in
Beverly Hills and he too liked what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sad at all," O'Neal said Wednesday. "I'm happy for Mr.
West. I hadn't seen him smile in a long time."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, he hadn't had enough reason.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't as difficult a decision as it seemed to be," Rosen
said. "It was an emotional decision because he's an emotional man.
But once he figured he was going back to work, he kept saying, 'I
would love to rebuild a team.' Then, everything sort of fell into
alignment. He didn't have to go back to work. He wanted to go back to
work."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker watched Wednesday's practice from a training table
set up courtside, where trainer Gary Vitti worked at the bone bruise
on Walker's left knee.</TE>
<TE>   The bruise, suffered about two weeks ago in a practice collision
with teammate Mark Madsen, is expected to heal enough to allow Walker
to play Sunday in the first game of the Western Conference
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be sore," Walker said from atop an exercise
machine. "There's not much we can do about it, just make sure it
doesn't get worse."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers would like to have Walker practice Friday--the Lakers
are off today--and Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Walker played 17.3 minutes a game in the Portland series, about
seven minutes off his regular-season average.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ramon Guce has been dynamite in races around a turn at Los Alamitos
and the jockey has three more live chances tonight.</LD>
<LD>   In the first, a 41/2-furlong race for $5,000 maiden fillies and
mares, Guce will be on Forever Jan, who should be a short price to
earn her first victory in her fifth career start. The Ole' filly has
not been close in three races at Santa Anita this year.</LD>
<LD>   Two races later, Guce will ride Mistyr Sam, a 7-year-old Arabian
gelding, who drops to the $5,000 level after finishing second at
nearly 20-1 against $6,250 claimers 11 nights ago.</LD>
<TE>   He will break from Post 2 in the field of six going 41/2 furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   In the fifth, the night's other thoroughbred race, Guce will ride
Admiral Challenge, a front-running type who will be trying for his
second consecutive victory for trainer Elmer January.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Forever Jan. 2. Chispiro. 3. Raambo. 4. First Steps
Special. 5. Admiral Challenge. 6. BW Beduina. 7. Solar Dash. 8. Makin
Memories.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Forever Jan in the first, use Chispiro and Tierra
Firme in the second, Raambo, Fmr Petes Sake, Scheriff and Seyvilla
Samsagain in the third and First Steps Special, Sweet Mama Gene and
Crimson Jess in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Perfect Platinum hopped in the air at the break
in her bow for trainer Chuck Treece and now drops in class in
tonight's sixth. Boys N Berry adds Lasix and switches to Joe Badilla
Jr. after a claim in the eighth and final race.</TE>

<DH>Santiago's Mowatt Leads Southland With 293 in 22 Games</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The hand-me-down glove was weather-beaten, stained and frayed, but it
was the best Valentine's Day present Taryne Mowatt had ever received.</LD>
<LD>   Mowatt, a sophomore pitcher for the Corona Santiago High softball
team, got the glove this year from her pitching coach, Doug Finch. It
once belonged to Finch's daughter, Jennie, an All-American pitcher at
Arizona who last season won an NCAA-record 32 games without a loss.</LD>
<LD>   Perfection seems to be rubbing off on Mowatt, who earlier this
season strung together 88 consecutive scoreless innings, three shy of
the Southern Section record set by Tracy Compton of Santa Maria
Righetti in 1981.</LD>
<TE>   Mowatt has also been piling up strikeouts at an eye-popping rate,
leading the Southland with 293 through 22 games. The section record
is 509 by Placentia Valencia's Michele Granger in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just worried about winning," Mowatt said. "Everything else is
just a bonus."</TE>
<TE>   She needn't worry.</TE>
<TE>   She has a record of 17-4-1 and Santiago, No. 10 in The Times'
rankings, is 17-4-1, 9-2-1. The Sharks are in first place in the
Mountain View League after their nine-inning, 2-1 victory over No. 23
Corona (16-8, 8-4) on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt, who has pitched every inning for Santiago this season,
threw a three-hitter, striking out 16. She gave up her second home
run of the season, to Washington-bound shortstop Dena Tyson, in the
bottom of the sixth. In the ninth, Mowatt got a one-out single.
Kelsey Delannoy replaced her as a pinch-runner, then scored the
game-winner on a two-out single by Justine Yacco.</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt's drive for success started early. She was 8 when she began
meeting with Finch once a week at his La Mirada practice center to
polish her pitching and hitting skills. It was during these sessions
that Mowatt began using Jennie's old leather glove.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have asked if I could have [the glove]," Mowatt said,
"but only once."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Finch, who launched his private coaching business after he
quit driving a cement mixer several years ago because of a back
injury, believes Mowatt, 15, has a bright future.</TE>
<TE>   "To a certain extent, she's already at [Jennie's] level," Finch
said. "She's throwing 65 mph, has masterful command of all of her
pitches and she's intelligent out there."</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt's dedication--she also plays for a club team in San Diego,
traveling three times a week to practice--has not gone unnoticed by
her Santiago teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "We see it when she plays," first baseman Sarah Murphy said. "She
goes out there every day and loves playing the game."</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt's scoreless streak ended last Friday with consecutive
doubles by Norco in the second inning of a game it went on to win,
2-0.</TE>
<TE>   "That caught me off guard," Murphy said. "I had never seen anyone
get back-to-back doubles off her before."</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt's streak included a one-hitter in late March against
Hacienda Heights Wilson, then No. 2 in The Times' rankings. She
struck out 21 in the nine-inning, 1-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Mowatt opened the Charter Oak tournament with a
perfect game against Hacienda Heights Los Altos. She closed it with a
four-hit, 13-strikeout performance against Covina Charter Oak,
winning, 3-0, in the championship game.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Robinson, a junior second baseman, doesn't mind the lack of
action on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of confidence when she's pitching," Robinson said.
"She always comes through for us."</TE>
<TE>   Mowatt is looking forward to another trip this weekend, when she
will travel to Tucson to watch Finch pitch her final regular-season
home game for Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   In the coming years, Mowatt is hoping to make more trips to
Hillenbrand Stadium, where attendance for Wildcat softball games
averaged 1,660 last season, second-best among Division I teams.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wanted to go there but didn't know they were good
until a few years ago," she said. "I just liked their colors when I
was a kid."</TE>

summer--a violation that came to light when senior strong safety

collapsed during the Aug. 3 workout and died.</TE>
<TE>   His mother, Linda Will, who filed a wrongful death lawsuit against
Northwestern, said Wednesday the punishment was inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the NCAA should step up and impose a penalty more
commensurate for [Northwestern] not doing its best to save a human
life," Will said. "I'm enraged [the school] would have the power to

<HD>Land Project Could Yield Stadium</HD>
<DH>Football: City Council lays groundwork for redevelopment
district that advocates say could bring NFL back to L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday laid the groundwork for a
massive redevelopment district with the potential to generate
billions of dollars in tax revenue--some of which could be used to
help clear the land for a downtown football stadium advocates say is
needed to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The proposed 879-acre redevelopment zone, called City Center,
would engulf a large swath of downtown L.A., its uneven boundaries
jutting roughly north to 2nd Street, west to the Harbor Freeway,
south to just short of the Santa Monica Freeway and east to Spring
Street.</LD>
<LD>   It would allow for a football stadium in the South Park area,
although that project was not mentioned at the hearing. The zone also
would accommodate different businesses and housing.</LD>
<TE>   The plan, which has been fast-tracked, would give Mayor James Hahn
the tools to achieve his stated goal, bringing the NFL back to L.A.
The council will vote on the proposal next week.</TE>
<TE>   The district is backed by a coalition of power brokers who want to
build a state-of-the-art NFL stadium adjacent to Staples Center, led
by Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz. However, it is not considered
essential to stadium plans.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would create a powerful Community Redevelopment
Authority that could help with land acquisition through the power of
condemnation, and would create a mechanism to capture tax-increment
revenues from the newly drawn district.</TE>
<TE>   It would also effectively help recreate the public-private
partnership that led to the construction of Staples Center, which
would be well received by the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas acknowledged it could help
bring the NFL back to Los Angeles: "But it's not a sure bet ... there
are other potential uses for the land that will get priority
consideration. Namely, housing."</TE>
<TE>   Casey Wasserman and Tim Leiweke, partners in the Anschutz
coalition, will meet with NFL executives in New York next week to
discuss the details of bringing an NFL team to L.A. for the first
time since the Raiders and Rams left in 1995. The group also includes
supermarket magnate Ron Burkle and developer Ed Roski, the architect
of the Staples deal.</TE>

<HD>Sharks Already Circling</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Home ice is no help for weary Colorado as San Jose
opens series with 6-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Teemu Selanne ended his playoff slump by scoring twice, and Evgeni
Nabokov stopped 27 shots as the San Jose Sharks beat the Colorado
Avalanche, 6-3, Wednesday night in Game 1 of the Western Conference
semifinals.</LD>
<LD>   Selanne, who led the Sharks with 29 goals during the regular
season, had not scored in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose took an early lead, withstood a rally from the defending
Stanley Cup champion and put it away with two goals in 2:46 of the
third period.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado, which finished a physical seven-game series against the
Kings two nights earlier, was sluggish early on. And defenseman Rob
Blake, Colorado's second-leading scorer during the regular season,
did not play because of an undisclosed leg injury. Avalanche
officials listed him as day to day.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose's Mike Ricci took advantage, scoring 6:13 into the game
after a feed by Niklas Sundstrom from behind the net slipped through
the crease. Patrick Roy couldn't reach the pass with his stick and
Ricci one-timed it past him as Ricci was falling. It was Ricci's
third of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Selanne made it 2-0, beating Roy to the glove side with a hard
shot from the right faceoff dot after beating Greg de Vries into the
Colorado zone.</TE>
<TE>   Selanne put the Sharks up, 3-0, midway in the second, one-timing a
pass from Marco Sturm from behind the net between Roy's pads.</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche seemed finished at that point, but rallied around a
lucky bounce that ended Nabokov's scoreless streak in the Pepsi
Center at 176 minutes 37 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Forsberg sent a pass to the point to Adam Foote, who
one-timed a shot that was headed high. The puck bounced off Chris
Drury between the circles and Nabokov was caught off-guard when the
puck changed directions.</TE>
<TE>   The goal with 5:27 left in the second was Colorado's first against
Nabokov at home since March 20, 2001, when de Vries scored with 2:53
left in a 4-1 Colorado victory.</TE>
<TE>   De Vries made it a one-goal game 3:24 later with a wrist shot
after a faceoff in San Jose's zone. Patrick Marleau made it 4-2 with
a shot from just inside Colorado's blue line with 7:26 left, banging
it in off the right post past Roy. Scott Thornton put the Sharks up
by three with 4:40 left, and Bryan Marchment scored an empty-netter
with five seconds remaining.</TE>

<LD>Mats Sundin could return to the Toronto Maple Leaf lineup if their
second-round series against the Ottawa Senators is a long one.</LD>
<LD>   It would be an amazing recovery from a broken wrist suffered April
18. Sundin broke the wrist in the opening game of the first-round
series against the New York Islanders, and played the next two games
before pain intensified and he was unable to hold a stick. The
initial prognosis for recovery was four to six weeks.</LD>

<TE>   The NHL fined Toronto General Manager and Coach Pat Quinn $30,000
for comments he made to reporters during the Eastern Conference
quarterfinals against the New York Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn was critical after New York's Shawn Bates was awarded a
penalty shot with 2:30 left in Game 4. Bates scored to give the
Islanders a 4-3 victory that tied the series, 2-2. "I've had some
pretty disappointing results from officiating, but never one like
this," Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calgary's Jarome Iginla, who led the league in goals and points
this season, and goalies Patrick Roy of Colorado and Jose Theodore of
Montreal are finalists for the Hart Trophy, awarded annually to the
league's most valuable player. Iginla had 52 goals and 96 points for
the Flames, who finished 32-35-12-3. The nomination of Roy and
Theodore mark the first time since 1994 that two goalies have been
among the three Hart finalists.... Ziggy Palffy and Lubomir Visnovsky
of the Kings flew to Sweden to play for their native Slovakia in the
World Ice Hockey Championships. Team Canada inquired about the
availability of Jason Allison, but Allison is unable to play after
suffering a leg cramp in Saturday's game against the Colorado
Avalanche.... Two-time NHL All-Star Milan Hejduk of the Avalanche was
cited for driving 102 mph in a 65-mph zone but may not face jail time
under a possible plea deal. Hejduk was pulled over when returning
from Aspen, Colo., to his home in Highlands Ranch, just south of
Denver.... Tampa Bay defenseman Petr Svoboda, who hadn't played since
suffering a concussion in Dec. 2000, retired after 18 seasons in the
NHL. Svoboda was an NHL All-Star in 2000 and had 58 goals and 341
assists.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good pitching tends to be contagious, and the Colorado Rockies are
proving it can happen even at Coors Field.</LD>
<LD>   Denny Neagle gave the Rockies their fifth consecutive strong
start, limiting Pittsburgh to three hits in eight innings and the
Rockies extended their winning streak to five games with a 6-0
victory Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Colorado starters are a combined 5-0 with a 0.78 earned-run
average in the last five games--all at Coors.</LD>
<TE>   "These guys are pitching lights out," said Clint Hurdle, who
improved to 5-0 as the Rockies' manager. "They seem to be one-upping
each other right now."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, which blanked the Pirates, 10-0, Tuesday night, produced
consecutive shutouts for the first time in the eight-year history of
Coors Field.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the 18th shutout overall at Coors Field, the
hitter-haven that opened in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   New York 7, Arizona 1--Steve Trachsel pitched into the seventh
inning, and Jeromy Burnitz hit a three-run homer as the Mets won
their sixth in a row with a victory at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Joe McEwing was two for three with a run-scoring triple for the
Mets, who have outscored the Diamondbacks, 17-2, and outhit them,
28-6, in the first two games of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a lower back strain, Randy Johnson, 6-0 in April,
missed a scheduled start for the first time in nearly two years. His
replacement, Todd Stottlemyre, gave up six runs and nine hits in 31/3
innings.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 4, Chicago 3--The Padres overcame two homers by Sammy
Sosa at San Diego and sent the Cubs to their season-high fifth
consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby Jones (3-1) defeated the Cubs for the ninth consecutive
time, giving up two runs and six hits in 52/3 innings. He struck out
a season-high seven and walked two in improving to 11-1 in 15 career
appearances against Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Trevor Hoffman pitched a perfect ninth for his 321st save with the
Padres, a major league record for most saves with one team. Dennis
Eckersley set the old record with Oakland from 1987 to '95.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 3, Milwaukee 1--Tom Glavine (5-1) allowed three hits over
eight innings, his ERA rising to 0.93 because of Jose Hernandez's
solo homer in the eighth at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves, whose 12-15 record in April was their worst since
1990, gave Glavine a three-run cushion with homers by Chipper Jones
and Marcus Giles off Ruben Quevedo (1-3).</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Houston 4--Vladimir Guerrero homered twice at Houston
and drove in four runs to overcome a three-run homer by Lance
Berkman, his major league-leading 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, who leads the majors with 32 runs batted in, extended
his hitting streak to 11 with his third two-homer game this season
and the 16th of his career. He has nine home runs this season.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 2, Philadelphia 1--Reggie Sanders hit a tiebreaking
home run off Ricky Bottalico (0-2) in the seventh at San Francisco,
sending the Phillies to their seventh loss in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, missing from San Francisco's starting lineup because
of sore legs, didn't start for the fourth time in 27 games but
entered in the eighth as part of a double switch. Bonds was on deck
when the Giants made the final out of the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 6, Florida 4--Tino Martinez hit his first two homers of
the season, and Travis Smith (1-0) pitched six impressive innings at
St. Louis for his first career victory.</TE>

<HD>Back in His Old Kentucky Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>The starting gate was a cracked driveway. The finish line was a
crooked crabapple tree.</LD>
<LD>   The course was three-tenths of a mile past the Moirs', past the
Browders', past the nasty doctor's wife and the snarling boxer
Geronimo and the place where I once pulled a knife on the
neighborhood bully.</LD>
<LD>   The horse was a bike.</LD>
<TE>   The jockey was I.</TE>
<TE>   Every first Saturday in May, I would climb aboard my black
Schwinn, dip my nose to the metal bar, and race around my
neighborhood flapping an imaginary whip, dreaming about a call.</TE>
<TE>   "And down the stretch they come ... and it's Plaschke aboard the
leader ... it's Plaschke bringing him home ... "</TE>
<TE>   Growing up across town from Churchill Downs, I never pretended to
make a game-winning basket or hit a game-winning home run.</TE>
<TE>   I pretended to win the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Then I left home, and pretended it didn't exist.</TE>
<TE>   That circular course became a straight line, out of town, through
college, to the working world, to the West Coast, far away from a
family that cared far too much about two puny minutes.</TE>
<TE>   So what if my great uncle Ed was a jockey.</TE>
<TE>   So what if my uncle Bill once owned a horse, and has published
more than four decades worth of mimeographed derby ratings.</TE>
<TE>   So what if my father claimed to have set a record by drinking 15
mint juleps, after which he retired to watch the event from a
backyard tree.</TE>
<TE>   For my family, the Derby is not simply a horse race, it's a
tradition that dug and twisted underneath us like the roots of that
crooked crabapple tree.</TE>
<TE>   We could bend and crack and still we held firm, in our backstretch
work ethic and roses ideals, our life personified in that first
Saturday in May.</TE>
<TE>   Some would say we were well planted. I thought we were stuck.</TE>
<TE>   The moment I was old enough to realize the ridiculousness of a
150-pound kid impersonating a jockey, I applied that imaginary whip
to my life and away I went, sprinting into a world far from the world
of my youth.</TE>
<TE>   "You coming home to cover the Derby this year?" my parents would
ask, hopefully.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to cover the Lakers and Dodgers," I would say, somberly,
but secretly pleased.</TE>
<TE>   For 25 years, this was my declaration of independence.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day last winter, my father fell down some steps. My
mother grew weary caring for him. Their needs were evolving. Their
lives were changing.</TE>
<TE>   The only one who was stuck, it seemed, was me.</TE>
<TE>   My parents had long since stopped calling to ask whether I was
coming home for the race so, one day, after some gentle prodding from
a boss who understands these things, I called them.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm, um, covering the Derby this year," I said.</TE>
<TE>   I anticipated sighs. I prepared for aloofness.</TE>
<TE>   After all these years of covering every major sporting event but
the one that mattered most to them, I expected attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, I got questions.</TE>
<TE>   "You want us to pick you up at the airport?" said Dad.</TE>
<TE>   "You want us to fix up a room?'' said Mom.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm here, and the name on my press credential is misspelled,
and I deserve it.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Plaschge has missed a lot.</TE>
<TE>   The house where mint leaves grew wild around the garage,
accounting for my father's record consumption, has long since been
sold.</TE>
<TE>   My uncle Bill, who once set a Derby party standard by opening a
parimutuel window over the patio, has closed shop.</TE>
<TE>   Also, nobody in our family sneaks through holes in a fence
anymore, climbing atop a barn's tar roof and paying for their Derby
ticket in second-degree burns.</TE>
<TE>   My people are at the fancy tables now, although not so fancy that
I can't hear them now, whooping it up in the Eclipse Room, betting
the tax refund and eating hot browns and pounding their elbows as if
they were at the kitchen table.</TE>
<TE>   Which, now that I think about it, they were.</TE>
<TE>   The reason the Kentucky Derby has lasted 128 years despite a
decline in national horse racing interest is that it's not about the
horses.</TE>
<TE>   It's about that kitchen table, shaped like an oval, covered in
dirt, 11/4 miles long.</TE>
<TE>   The Derby has been the steady, plain-spoken center of a sports
world that has slowly changed around it.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters gets longer. The Indy 500 gets political. The Daytona
500 kills a hero.</TE>
<TE>   Where else but the Derby does the winner simply run faster than
anyone else? Where else do the losers offer no excuse?</TE>
<TE>   There is no trash talking when the competitors can't talk. There
is no ugliness when the event only lasts two minutes, and is run for
a blanket of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   No other event is so basic, so consistent, so eternal, Aristides
becoming Cannonade becoming Monarchos.</TE>
<TE>   The Derby that was here when I left town 25 years ago is the same
Derby that was waiting for me this week.</TE>
<TE>   Standing under twin spires that lighted up the predawn darkness
like a warm gaze Wednesday, I saw the spot where I kissed my first
girl, drank my first beer, spit out my first nasty-tasting julep.</TE>
<TE>   It was on Derby Day that I first saw my older brother after a
yearlong estrangement, hugging him in the infield because that is
what you do in church.</TE>
<TE>   It was on Derby Day that I last saw my grandfather, visiting his
small apartment, laying on his old couch in exhaustion, recounting
the race.</TE>
<TE>   Granddaddy Willie died several months later, remembering nothing
if not the great ride of Genuine Risk.</TE>
<TE>   It was at the Derby that I first cried at a song, you know which
song, and that lump has returned whenever I've heard it since, trying
to ignore a race that will not ignore me.</TE>
<TE>   When I walked into my house after flying here Tuesday afternoon,
walking past the Derby napkins and Derby cups and framed drawing of a
Derby finish, my mother was missing.</TE>

<HD>Iverson and 76ers Force the Issue With Celtics</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson wouldn't stop himself, and neither could the Boston
Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   After missing 17 of 20 shots, Iverson scored Philadelphia's final
eight points, including a go-ahead 14-footer with 22.6 seconds left
that lifted the 76ers to an 83-81 victory over Boston, forcing a
decisive Game 5 in their first-round series.</LD>
<LD>   Game 5 is Friday at Boston. The 76ers, the defending Eastern
Conference champions, are trying to become the seventh team in NBA
history to win a best-of-five series after losing the first two
games.</LD>
<TE>   Iverson finished with 28 points.</TE>
<TE>   ''The only person that can stop me is me,'' Iverson said. ''I felt
I got good shots, open jumpers, shots I can make, but I didn't make
them. I know how to play through struggles now. I know how to miss 10
shots and keep fighting and feel like I can make the next one.''</TE>
<TE>   Antoine Walker scored all 25 of his points in the first three
quarters, and Paul Pierce had 20 for the Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   ''We had an opportunity to close them out,'' Walker said. ''We
have to make sure what we worked for all season pays off and come up
with a big win Friday.''</TE>

<LD>A car bomb exploded within 200 yards of Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in
Madrid on Wednesday evening less than four hours before Real Madrid
played Barcelona in the semifinals of the European Champions League.</LD>
<LD>   The blast, one of two to rock the Spanish capital, caused minor
injuries to eight people, mostly from flying glass. Police had
evacuated the area in time after receiving a warning from ETA, the
Basque separatist group that claimed responsibility for the
explosions. The second blast occurred near a railway station half an
hour later, causing no injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Officials from both teams met with leaders of UEFA, European
soccer's governing body, and decided to go ahead with the match,
which ended in a 1-1 tie in front of more than 75,000. The result
meant that eight-time European champion Real Madrid won the two-game
series, 3-1, on aggregate, and will play Bayer Leverkusen of Germany
in the May 15 final.</LD>
<TE>   Spain national team striker Raul gave Real Madrid the lead two
minutes before halftime, but Barcelona, which needed to win by three
goals after losing the first match, 2-0, tied the score in the 48th
minute on an own goal by Ivan Helguera.</TE>

<TE>   After trying for more than two years to find a buyer, Airdrie, a
124-year-old club in the Scottish second division, went into
liquidation, having earlier released its coaches and players. The
club has debts of more than $4 million and its stadium and name are
for sale.</TE>

<TE>   Ecuador was beaten, 2-1, by the Brazilian club Internacional of
Porto Alegre in front of 42,000 at Quito in its final warmup game at
home before leaving for the World Cup.</TE>

<TE>   England's coach, Sven Goran Eriksson, said he will delay selecting
his 23-man roster by two days, until after Manchester United's game
against Arsenal and Liverpool's match against Blackburn Rovers on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   More than half of England's players will be involved in those
games, and Eriksson fears that injuries similar to those that
recently sidelined United's David Beckham and Garyl Neville could
again force him to change plans.</TE>
<TE>   Eriksson will announce his roster May 9 and the team will go to
Dubai on May 13 for rest and recuperation before traveling to Japan,
where it plays Sweden, Argentina and Nigeria in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   Djalminha, expected to be chosen later this month for Brazil's
team, lost his temper Wednesday while training with his Spanish club,
Deportivo La Coruna, and head-butted Coach Javier Irureta.</TE>
<TE>   The two have been at odds for some time over Djalminha's scant
playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the result of end-of-season nerves," Irureta said. "It
happens in a lot of teams."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria Coach Adegboye Onigbinde has alleged he was offered bribes
by an unidentified player agent who wanted some of his clients
included in Nigeria's team.</TE>
<TE>   "I was offered $2,000 per player by an agent, but I refused and
warned him to stay clear of me and the team," Onigbinde said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Africa's player of the year, striker El Hadj Diouf of Senegal,
blasted his country's soccer federation for failing to provide the
national team with more games as it prepares for its first World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal has played only one game since February, and Diouf
believes the lack of game sharpness will show when Senegal plays
defending champion France in the tournament's opening game, May 31 at
Seoul, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a farce what's going on around the national team, our
preparation has been sabotaged," Diouf, 21, told the Senegalese
newspaper L'Info.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World Cup cohost Japan's first match is not until June 4, but
already Coach Philippe Troussier is making his post-tournament plans.</TE>
<TE>   Troussier on Wednesday told Agence France-Presse he had been
contacted to become coach of Olympique Marseille and is talking with
the French first-division team.</TE>
<TE>   "I have always made it clear that I did not want to carry on after
the World Cup," he said. "After four years of a job that has been as
uplifting and rich as my experience in Japan, I now want to pursue my
own personal development elsewhere."</TE>

<DH>Minnesota: A possible stadium bill by state legislature
provides hope to Twin loyalists, but it may not be enough to save
team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSS NEWHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The facing of the white draping that hides the empty,
right-center-field seats in the upper deck at the Metrodome reflects
a colorful history.</LD>
<LD>   Affixed to the draping are banners commemorating the World Series
titles of 1987 and 1991, the American League title of 1965, and the
division titles of '69 and '70.</LD>
<LD>   There also are large photographs of Harmon Killebrew, Rod Carew,
Tony Oliva, Kent Hrbek and Kirby Puckett, a group of renowned players
who have each had their uniform numbers retired by the Minnesota
Twins.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the comparatively young, home-grown and modestly paid Twins
of 2002--a $40-million payroll ranks 27th among the 30 teams--are
trying to enhance that history by winning the division title they
unexpectedly chased into last August before finishing second in the
American League Central with 85 wins, six games behind the Cleveland
Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Now, before that draping becomes nothing more than the shroud on a
once-thriving franchise, before it reaches the point, perhaps, where
there is nothing left but the dirge of contraction, the Twins are
trying to deliver what they still hope will be more than a final
statement.</TE>
<TE>   The hope in the clubhouse, and for the loyalists in the stands and
community, is that the Minnesota Legislature, before it adjourns May
20, will produce a stadium finance bill attractive enough to lure a
prospective buyer and remove the Twins from the contraction gallows.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bell, the Twins' president and liaison to owner Carl Pohlad,
has assured a conference committee of the Minnesota Senate and House
that a viable financing package will eliminate the specter of
contraction, but the future of the Twins remains as complex and
uncertain as the deep-rooted skepticism regarding the true intentions
of Pohlad and Commissioner Bud Selig, his close friend and onetime
debtor.</TE>
<TE>   The clock is ticking here, and if the Twins helped regenerate
enthusiasm with their promising season last year, the players know
that their early success in the new season may not be as important to
the franchise's future as what the Legislature does in the next three
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point," infielder Denny Hocking said, "we can only worry
about the things we can control. We spent a long winter worrying
about contraction and stadium issues. Now we just have to worry about
putting more runs on the board than the team we're playing. We've
been given a reprieve. We feel we've been given one year to do
something and we're up to the challenge. We have an opportunity to
play this one last year together and we're excited about that."</TE>
<TE>   The reprieve came in the form of legal hurdles, forestalling
contraction in 2002, saving the Twins and Montreal Expos from the
gallows.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in a preview of what could become Selig's worst nightmare,
the Expos also are acting as if they have title aspirations, and if
the thought of a Minnesota-Montreal World Series isn't enough to give
the commissioner palpitations, as Twin first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz put it, teammate Hocking said he has to believe both
teams "are on a mission ... [although] I don't think we need
motivation to win. We have the talent to win, period."</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, of course, are done in Montreal despite their April
success.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, who in 1988 became the first American League team to
draw 3 million, are a different story.</TE>
<TE>   The Metrodome is not back to the Homer Hankie, decibel-busting
electricity of the 1987 and 1991 World Series, but attendance is up
almost 40,000 from the 1.7 million pace of last year (when it jumped
700,000 in response to the first winning season since 1992) and, said
Mientkiewicz, "I got goose bumps when we had 49,000 here on opening
night this year, and it's certainly an improvement over when I first
came up in '98 and our crowds were so small you could hear people
ordering hot dogs."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, in response to Selig's Nov. 6 contraction
announcement, a "Keep the Twins at Home" drive obtained 185,000
signatures in a three-week sweep through the club's five-state
market.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we made a real statement," organizer Paul Ridgeway said
in reflection. "People want the Twins to stay and are willing to
support a public-private partnership, depending on the Twins'
contribution. I also think most legislators now feel it's safe to
support a stadium financing bill, depending on the Twins'
contribution."</TE>
<TE>   Separate bills have passed the Senate and House and are being
consolidated in committee, in consultation with the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Minnesota sources believe Gov. Jesse Ventura, despite
his concern over baseball's labor problems, his reservations about
government involvement, the lingering memory of his Congressional
free-for-all with Selig and the fact he is closing the Governor's
Mansion because of a budget shortfall, will see that a viable package
gets done.</TE>
<TE>   The basic plan calls for a $330-million, roof-ready park, with the
House version asking the Twins to pay $165 million, which is
considerably more than Forbes magazine's recent franchise valuation
of $127 million and the $150 million Pohlad reportedly will receive
if the Twins are contracted.</TE>
<TE>   A highly placed baseball official said he thinks an agreement at
$100 million, which the club has offered in previous scenarios, is
workable, but the situation is so complex that it is difficult to
predict how it will play out.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bell, the Twins' president: "I'm confident they're going to
pass something, but I'm not yet confident it will attract a new
buyer. They could say, 'Here, we've passed a new stadium bill, it's a
good bill, take it or leave it.' They could do that as easy as not."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pam Wheelock, Ventura's finance commissioner: "It is not
government's responsibility to help the Twins sell the team at a
favorable price."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the daunting question of how much the Twins contribute,
there is a hornets' nest of other potential hurdles. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   * Legislators wary of increasing taxes have to be cognizant of the
stadium demands that are also coming from the NFL Vikings and
University of Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   * There is the risk of an uncivil war in determining which Twin
city would be home to the new park.</TE>
<TE>   * And there is no assurance that Pohlad, absent recent offers, can
find a buyer--local or otherwise--willing to take on the stadium
obligation and a franchise value inflated by the threat of
contraction at a time when 1) labor problems could shut down the
industry in November or before, 2) the players' union still has a
contraction grievance pending, and 3) the Metropolitan Sports
Facilities Commission, having stopped contraction in 2002 by winning
a temporary injunction, is now slated to go to court in August,
arguing it was prevented from negotiating a new lease with the Twins
because of contraction.</TE>
<TE>   If all of that isn't enough to give a prospective owner pause,
there is also the issue of local revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Some in baseball believe it's just not there--even in a new park.</TE>
<TE>   Operating in the nation's 13th-largest market, the Twins currently
rank 29th in revenue, ahead of only the Expos.</TE>
<TE>   An industry official, making the case for contraction, said the
club expects to lose more than $15 million this year despite the
attendance increase and a $23-million dole from revenue sharing.</TE>
<TE>   No one is more familiar with Pohlad and the complexities than
Clark Griffith, a Minneapolis lawyer and son of Calvin Griffith, the
former Twins' owner.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith believes in the market--"the relationship between owner
and community has never been properly nurtured," he said--but his
offers to buy the team in 1994 and 1997 were rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a group that's still interested, but it's definitely
complicated," Griffith said, raising questions pertaining to Pohlad's
commitment to selling, the Legislature's ability to develop a
workable stadium plan and the labor risk at the end of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Then there's the uncertainty of contraction, which gives Pohlad
an attractive option financially and artificially inflates the value
of the franchise, making it difficult for a prospective local owner,"
Griffith said.</TE>
<TE>   "The cost of the franchise, combined with the stadium obligation,
can't be so onerous that it prevents a new owner from making the
necessary player moves."</TE>
<TE>   Contraction, of course, paralyzed the uncertain Twins until Selig
gave them permission to conduct business as usual in January.</TE>
<TE>   Third base coach Ron Gardenhire celebrated the New Year on Jan. 4
when he was selected to replace the retiring Tom Kelly as manager.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an ugly winter in the Twin Cities," Gardenhire said, not
referring to the weather. "Everybody in the organization was burdened
with questions they couldn't answer. It was no fun, but as I told the
players in spring training, 'Now comes the fun part. Now you get to
go out and play.'"</TE>
<TE>   No one in the Minnesota clubhouse believes the team has played to
its full ability yet, but the Twins are 11-1 at home, 6-10 on the
road and only a half game behind the Chicago White Sox despite the
loss of middle infielders Cristian Guzman and Luis Rivas, designated
hitter David Ortiz and 17-game winner Joe Mays, all out with injuries
and only Guzman not on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Gardenhire calls it his M*A*S*H unit, but he makes no excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to play every series like it's our last," he said. "If we
pitch and catch like we're capable, we can compete with anyone in the
division. This is the third year at this level for most of our guys.
Our goal is to get into September in the race. We were there last
year and didn't perform. We should have learned from it and be better
for it."</TE>
<TE>   Pitching the ball and catching it is the Twins' strength, as
Gardenhire noted.</TE>
<TE>   A physically sound Mays would give the Twins three starters who
won 15 or more games last year. First baseman Mientkiewicz
(pronounced Mint-kay-vich) and center fielder Torii Hunter, a budding
superstar who is tied for second in the AL in home runs, won Gold
Gloves last year, third baseman Corey Koskie may soon join them, and
a sound Guzman and Rivas may be the league's best double-play duo now
that Roberto Alomar is no longer teamed with Omar Vizquel.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt in my mind we should win the division,"
Mientkiewicz said. "We have one more year under our belt, and the
guys we're pulling up from triple-A have been up before. If we had
gone wire to wire last year, we wouldn't have known how we did it.
This year there's a realization it's a marathon and our better
baseball is to come."</TE>
<TE>   Along with it, of course, will come the constant reminders about
contraction and the uncertain future, a test of their focus.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone made it seem that all we had to do was win and it would
go away, but we [finished above .500] for the first time in a long
time last year and it's still in our face," Mientkiewicz said. "We've
proven we can be competitive, and now it's up to the fans and
legislature. We'll keep doing our part, but our part in the grand
scheme of things is minor."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard to contract two division winners, if it came to
that.</TE>
<TE>   About as hard as getting a reading on the commissioner's
palpitations, if the Twins and Expos make it happen.</TE>

<HD>Daniels, Walker Deliver for Pepperdine</HD>

<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beau Daniels, the setter for Pepperdine's No. 1-ranked men's
volleyball team, usually has several options to go to as he directs
the Waves' balanced attack.</LD>
<LD>   But when a play breaks down or the team is struggling in a match,
he can always turn to old-reliable--outside hitter Lance Walker.</LD>
<LD>   "We know each other to the point where I know where he's going to
be and I can just put the ball up at a certain spot," Daniels said.
"I don't have to look for him on the court."</LD>
<TE>   Their symmetry has been a key component in Pepperdine's run to the
NCAA men's volleyball final four at University Park, Pa. The Waves
(28-4) will play a semifinal match against Ball State this afternoon
at 3 before Hawaii takes on host Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels will be a key figure in determining whether Pepperdine can
win its first national championship in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-4 senior has played in 116 of a possible 118 games this
season and has been the leader of a team that has won the most
matches in school history and is on a record 16-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows Daniels' value better than Walker, who has been a
teammate since both were members of Pierce College's state junior
college championship team in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no other setter I would want to have on my team," Walker
said. "He is confident in what he does and he works at the position.
He's made himself a great player."</TE>
<TE>   Both players had starring roles in the Waves' four-game victory
over Hawaii on Saturday night in the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation championship match. Daniels, who had 45 assists, set
Walker for a match-high 18 kills.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Vernovage said he pictured the duo having success wherever
they went to school. Now an assistant at Long Beach State, he coached
the Pierce team that ended Golden West's run of five consecutive
state titles.</TE>
<TE>   "Beau has obviously earned everything he's got," Vernovage said,
"and Lance is one of the best competitors and most athletic kids I've
ever come across."</TE>
<TE>   Walker, who attended North Hollywood High, is an extrovert and
speaks his mind.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about the Waves' title chances, he said, "We know that when
you're the top dog, everyone is coming after you. We're going to get
everyone's best shot."</TE>
<TE>   Born and reared in Texas, Daniels offers a firm handshake and
keeps his words to a minimum.</TE>
<TE>   "Beau will think everything through before he does something while
Lance has a lot of emotion which is great for volleyball," Vernovage
said. "Somehow, they've managed to work it out and play together.</TE>
<TE>   "They're two different kids but they both have the same goal."</TE>
<TE>   Daniels and Walker want to end their college careers in style.</TE>
<TE>   Said Daniels: "We said when we got here that we've got to win a
national championship."</TE>

<HD>Arafat's Woes Just Beginning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat's confinement may be coming to an end, but his
political and diplomatic troubles are just beginning.</LD>
<LD>   Inside his ruined compound, Arafat looked heroic to his people
merely by enduring Israel's siege. Once outside, he must address
growing--and often conflicting-- demands from Palestinians and the
international community to change his ways.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush has said Arafat now "must prove himself to me" by
leading his people away from violence and restoring security
cooperation with the same Israeli government that says it would still
like to banish him from the Palestinian territories. Palestinians are
looking for Arafat to prove to them that their sacrifices were not in
vain.</LD>
<TE>   Some Palestinians are clamoring for reforms. Others are clamoring
for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's security forces are in disarray. Israeli forces encircle
every important West Bank town and no longer hesitate to enter
Palestinian-controlled areas to hunt down militants. The Palestinian
economy is shattered and many of the trappings of statehood are gone.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat is faced with somehow rallying his shellshocked people,
rebuilding his ruined bureaucracy and developing a strategy to
counter what he and many Palestinians believe is Israeli Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon's plan to block the establishment of a
Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Israel agreed to free Arafat, his ministers were
squabbling about reconstruction efforts and Palestinian opposition
figures were calling for elections, an end to corruption and greater
democratization.</TE>
<TE>   Some Palestinian analysts fear that the destruction the Israeli
army inflicted during its monthlong sweep through the West Bank is so
profound, and demoralization so widespread, that Arafat will be
unable to rebuild the Palestinian Authority, which was created under
the 1993 Oslo peace accords.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian Authority is no longer relevant," said Khalil
Shikaki, a Palestinian pollster and political analyst. "Now militias
will rule the streets."</TE>
<TE>   But Arafat's aides say he is determined to rebuild, and quickly.
In meetings with U.S. and European representatives, Palestinians have
estimated that they will need $350 million to repair roads, homes,
businesses and ministries. So far, said Mohammed Shtayyeh, executive
director of PECDAR, the Palestinian Authority's development
corporation, they have received pledges of about $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We have quite an image of the destruction," confirmed Jean
Breteche, the European Commission's representative to the Palestinian
Authority. "Everybody is working fast to respond to it. We want to
help the population, reestablish the Palestinian administration and
work with them as closely as possible to come back to a normal
situation, to create an environment that is conducive to peace."</TE>
<TE>   Breteche said the European Commission is seeking assurances from
Israel that it will not again destroy infrastructure that
international donors pay to repair, and that it will allow
Palestinian institutions to function.</TE>
<TE>   "Our position is that we need a good administration in Palestine
to manage the civil society and the economy," Breteche said.</TE>
<TE>   Many Israelis would agree on the need for a strong Palestinian
administration but agree with the Israeli government that Arafat is
incapable of building it. The Palestinian Authority president emerges
from more than a month of confinement in his offices very much a man
on probation.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli mainstream "is divided between those who want to kill
Arafat and those who want to expel him," former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said on CNN Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Only the "loony left" still considers Arafat a partner for
negotiations, said Netanyahu, who is widely expected to challenge
Sharon in coming months for the leadership of the right-wing Likud
Party.</TE>
<TE>   But Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said the success of the
military campaign now winding down "depends on the speed in which
we'll enter the political negotiations. Otherwise, we'll return to
where we were before the operation."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Israeli government has deemed Arafat an enemy,
Ben-Eliezer voiced hope that the Palestinian leader will now seek a
negotiated settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "All the goals Arafat set for himself . . . have been crushed
before his very eyes," Ben-Eliezer told reporters as he toured a
Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. "The only chance to
resolve this problem is not through arms and terror, but by sitting
around the negotiating table."</TE>
<TE>   But Sharon's offer to negotiate nothing more than long-term
interim arrangements with the Palestinians, and his insistence that
no Jewish settlements will be abandoned, is unlikely to bring Arafat
back to talks. Palestinians say they have not endured 19 months of
bloodshed and economic hardship to again see the prospect of
statehood delayed indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   A renewed Palestinian suicide bombing campaign in Israeli towns
would trigger another military operation in the West Bank and
possibly the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army and government have warned.
Many Israeli analysts say a resurgence of Palestinian
attacks--regardless of who claims responsibility--also will result in
Arafat's immediate expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians view Israel's intentions with equal skepticism. Many
of them now are convinced that Israel will never allow a Palestinian
state to exist alongside it.</TE>
<TE>   "Sharon has pursued a checklist of destruction," Shtayyeh said.
"He has destroyed both our infrastructure and our superstructure.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent all these years preparing for the state, but he doesn't
believe in this manifestation of statehood. He is pursuing the total
repositioning of Israeli security forces and the reoccupation of the
West Bank. The West Bank was our state-in-the-making, and Ramallah
was the administrative capital of that state.</TE>
<TE>   "He has created chaos here."</TE>

<HD>China's Booming Economy Lagging Behind Persistent
Unemployment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>China marked Wednesday's May Day holiday by giving its citizens a
week off. But plenty of China's 1.2 billion people would rather be
working.</LD>
<LD>   Despite a booming economy, the jobless rate is surging to record
levels, creating a potential time bomb.</LD>
<LD>   The country has already shed tens of millions of jobs in the
painful transition to a market-oriented economy. About 20 million
more people could lose their jobs in the next four years, according
to the Labor Ministry.</LD>
<TE>   Even if the economy continues to grow by 7% a year, it would
generate only about 8 million jobs. That's not good enough for the
estimated 12 million to 13 million people pouring into the work force
every year, according to state media.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic that as China's growth rate is reported to be--and
has been--the highest in the world, unemployment has been rising,"
said Charles Wolf Jr., senior economist at Rand Corp. "Our estimate
is 23% to 24% of the labor force. That's 170 million people."</TE>
<TE>   The official jobless figure is only about 3.4%. But with waves of
labor unrest sweeping the country, it is increasingly difficult to
ensure the social stability so prized by leaders of the world's most
populous nation.</TE>
<TE>   Factory and oil field workers in northern China's rust belt have
staged massive protests recently to fight for lost jobs and benefits.
Their action has touched off similar movements around the country,
and no doubt makes Beijing nervous as it approaches a change in the
top leadership this fall.</TE>
<TE>   It is not only the bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises that is
hurting workers. Earlier this spring, about 2,000 employees of a
private toy factory in southern China protested their layoff. A New
York-based labor watchdog group said the company's Hong Kong owner
laid them off after losing big American customers, who pulled out
after learning of substandard working conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "China cannot continue to sacrifice workers' rights for the sake
of economic growth," said Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor
Watch. "Otherwise, labor unrest will become an even bigger burden on
China's future development."</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is not blind to the problem. The Labor Ministry said this
week that it would sponsor a national conference on unemployment. Big
cities such as Shanghai are already plowing resources into retraining
programs for laid-off workers and are paying more attention to labor
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   In the first 10 months of last year, Shanghai logged about 10,000
labor disputes, a 30% increase over the previous year, local
officials said. Workers frequently complain about being exploited by
bosses who ignore their welfare in pursuit of profits.</TE>
<TE>   Local media reports cited the case of one textile plant that
falsified the age of its employees to force them to retire. Another
reportedly cut salaries so much that angry workers killed their boss.</TE>
<TE>   Observers say people take matters into their own hands because
they lack a proper place to address their grievances.</TE>
<TE>   China does not allow independent labor unions.</TE>

<HD>Palestinians Inside Church Torn Between Loyalty, Fear</HD>
<DH>Standoff: A complicated psychological drama drags on amid
squalor, defiance and infighting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BETHLEHEM, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Corpses rotting beside the crypts of saints. Children sleeping where
tradition says the infant Jesus once lay. Gunmen bleeding to death in
the basilica of one of Christianity's most sacred shrines.</LD>
<LD>   As the confrontation at the besieged Church of the Nativity here
entered its 31st day in a sudden blaze of gunfire and flame today,
those inside appear to be actors in a complicated psychological
drama, something between a hostage situation and a prison standoff.</LD>
<LD>   Their story is slowly emerging, pieced together from interviews
with those still inside and those who have left the church.</LD>
<TE>   An estimated 40 priests, monks and nuns have remained inside the
church since April 2, when hundreds of Palestinians raced inside to
escape invading Israeli troops. The clerics say they feel a duty to
offer refuge but are repulsed by the presence of armed men.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians are equally conflicted, divided into factions of
factions. Some want exile abroad, a chance to fight another day. One
small group seeks to provoke a blood bath, hoping to further the
cause of a Palestinian state in the world's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some have said: 'I'll stay in the church. I prefer to die in the
church,' " said Omar Habib, a 16-year-old who left the sanctuary last
week. "They feel like what is happening inside the Church of the
Nativity will help bring about the state of Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   Of about 200 or so Palestinians who originally fled into the
church, about 150 remain, most of them armed with automatic weapons.
Israel has said that at least 10 and as many as 50 are terrorists,
responsible for killing civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Food and water are running low inside the cavernous basilica.
Israeli snipers continually shoot at those who brandish weapons. The
military has waged a campaign to erode morale, playing sirens to keep
the men awake.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis insist that both clerics and Palestinian civilians
are hostages. But not even priests who have fled the church say they
were forced to remain inside.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians who have emerged in recent days say those inside are
torn between loyalty to their brethren and fear of the Israeli
soldiers, who have killed five Palestinians during the standoff.</TE>
<TE>   But they also tell of pressure to remain united, to stay or go,
but only together. The continued presence of priests and civilians is
a guarantee of sorts for the safety of the most violent of those
inside--the members of militant groups accused of killing Israeli
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Both Palestinian government and militant leaders have made it
clear that all can leave, those who have emerged say. But doing so,
the leaders have warned, would be seen as a betrayal of sorts--a
death sentence in a society where collaborators are routinely killed
by vigilante mobs.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't try to leave on my own for one reason: I was afraid that
I might be accused of being a collaborator," said Thaer Mohammed
Manasra, a 20-year-old who was taken to an Israeli hospital after a
sniper shot him while he ventured outside to collect ferns to eat.</TE>
<TE>   The situation is just as complicated outside the towering walls of
the compound. The Palestinian leadership, the Israeli government, the
Vatican, the Greek Orthodox patriarchate, the Anglican Church, the
European Union, the United States and various other countries are
involved in the delicate diplomatic effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis have said they want the crisis to end peacefully,
thus avoiding the spectacle of a gun battle inside the church. But
they have not ruled out a military option.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making every effort humanly possible to get civilian
hostages and terrorists out of the church as quickly and safely as we
possibly can, but it's not open-ended," said Capt. Joel Leyden, an
army spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   In yet another reminder of the high tensions, early this morning,
gunfire erupted and a fire appeared to break out in the Franciscan
monastery that adjoins the church. The Israeli military said the
Palestinians fired at them, prompting a volley of warning shots.
Palestinians claimed that the Israelis had tried to storm the church.
It was unclear how the fire began.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff at the church began on the afternoon of April 2. As
locals stocked up in preparation for an expected Israeli invasion,
and militants gathered in Manger Square in front of the church to
make resistance plans, the Israeli army suddenly approached from all
directions.</TE>
<TE>   Shouts went up from different quarters: "Run to the church! Run to
the church!"</TE>
<TE>   The church has long defined Bethlehem, placed on a rise
overlooking the ancient city's olive groves and rock-terraced hills.
Thick, fortress-like walls surround the compound, about the size of
four square city blocks. On the north sit the Roman Catholic
buildings, including a monastery and St. Catherine's church, site of
the famous Christmas Eve Mass beamed around the world each year. The
Armenian and Greek Orthodox faiths share the south side of the
compound with their own gardens, monastery and chapels.</TE>
<TE>   The church itself lies at the center of the compound, sitting atop
a network of caves that includes the grotto revered by Christians as
the birthplace of Jesus and the tomb of Christian saints.</TE>
<TE>   Habib, the 16-year-old, was out in the street running to buy
medicine for his diabetic mother when he heard shots. He ran to the
local mosque, then heard the cries to run toward the church.</TE>
<TE>   When he got inside, he counted about 200 Palestinian men holed up
in the gloomy interior lighted only by high windows and candles. Old
oak beams dating from the Middle Ages stretched across the roof.
Smooth stones paved the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the men and boys were strangers to one another, with a few
groups of friends here and there.</TE>
<TE>   But there were also several groups of armed men, a total of
perhaps 100 to 150. They included Palestinian police, naval police
and the presidential guard.</TE>
<TE>   Also present were members of militant groups such as Islamic
Jihad, Hamas and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an offshoot of the
Tanzim, the military wing of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared," Habib said. "I didn't know how we were going to
get out of there."</TE>
<TE>   A Violent Turn</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for the standoff to become violent.</TE>
<TE>   On April 4, Samir Abraham Salman, 45, a mentally impaired man who
had spent most of his life working as a bell ringer at the church,
apparently decided to go home.</TE>
<TE>   He left from an entrance on the south side of the church, ignoring
or perhaps not comprehending the shouts of an Israeli sniper, who
killed him for fear he was a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   "He was killed, and I am sorry about it," said Col. Marcel Aviv,
the chief of operations at the church for the Israeli military.</TE>
<TE>   The circumstances of the next killing were unclear.</TE>
<TE>   In the early morning hours of April 8, a fire broke out in the
Franciscan monastery, in a second-floor dining hall and kitchen area.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians inside claim that the fire was the product of a
botched Israeli commando raid, sparked by either flares or stun
grenades.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis, however, say they have never entered the church or
the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, Khaled Siam, a Palestinian police officer, was
shot and killed during the confusion. The Palestinians said he was
rushing to extinguish the blaze. The Israelis said they saw a man
inside the area with a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   He was shot in the head, just below his left eye, dropping dead on
the spot. Suddenly, the Palestinians had a martyr for their cause.</TE>
<TE>   The Bethlehem region's Palestinian governor, Mohammed Madani, who
has been in the church since the beginning of the crisis, called all
the Palestinians together, according to several who recently fled.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'If you want to leave, leave.' But then he said, 'If you
leave, you will be considered a collaborator,' " said Jihad abu
Qamel, 16, the first Palestinian to flee the church.</TE>
<TE>   'I Don't Want to Die'</TE>
<TE>   Five days after Siam was killed, Hasman Nasser, also a Palestinian
police officer, became the third man shot during the siege. He
dragged himself from a nearby building to the main church basilica,
where he bled to death.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to die," he told rescuers inside the church as he
frantically tried to call for help. "I don't want to die."</TE>
<TE>   The days passed slowly. The Palestinians confined themselves to
the main basilica, lounging among the towering pillars, in nooks
filled with massive gold lamps and finely wrought mosaics from the
Byzantine era.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians would joke, play cards, and dream about food. At
night, two or three men would share a single blanket. They gradually
burned all the devotional candles in the church in an effort to stay
warm at night. On Fridays, they held traditional noon Muslim prayers
in the basilica.</TE>
<TE>   The younger children, ranging from 10 to 18, according to the
Israeli military, at first slept downstairs, in the underground
grotto.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 30 crammed together, trying to stay warm in the small space
bounded by gloomy, gray stone walls.</TE>
<TE>   Some slept on the 14-point star that Christians believe marks the
exact spot of the manger and where, in better times, the faithful
await their turn to prostrate themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to find any place warm. We put 10 candles lit and sat
next to them to be warm," said Fouaad Laham, 19, who left the church
with nine other teenagers a week ago.</TE>
<TE>   Food has grown increasingly scarce. For the first two weeks, meals
came from food stored at the various monasteries. The Palestinians
had at least one decent meal a day--fava beans, rice, even chicken.
Then, the supplies ran out.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the Israelis hoped to starve the Palestinians out,
Israeli military officials said. But the presence of the clerics
quashed that plan. The Israelis realized that they had to continue
supplying food to the clerics or risk starving priests, monks and
nuns as well.</TE>
<TE>   And so they set up a clandestine delivery system, supplying food
via different doors into the compound. But the clerics, in turn,
continued to share that food with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "The priest used to bring us food, but not enough for everybody,"
said Abdul Nashash, 17. "I started throwing up whatever I ate."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the meals became more and more infrequent. Rice was often
served in cooking water as a sort of soup.</TE>
<TE>   Men began stealing out at night into the hilly orchards behind the
compound's east walls, grabbing fruit, lemon tree leaves and
fiddlehead ferns usually steamed like greens.</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis also turned off water to the compound, forcing those
inside to rely on cisterns. They quickly drew down water levels,
reaching insect-filled muck at the bottom of the wells.</TE>
<TE>   Psychological Warfare</TE>
<TE>   The conditions began to wear on the Palestinians, as did Israeli
psychological tactics. On some days, soldiers threw in plastic
bottles with notes promising food and safe haven. There were even
phone numbers to call. "Don't think of the others. Think of
yourself," read one note.</TE>
<TE>   The corpses of the slain men were stored in a room in the Greek
Orthodox monastery and began to decompose. Bathrooms were limited,
and the lack of water turned them into foul cesspools.</TE>
<TE>   A sick, inescapable odor filled the vast and empty space of the
basilica.</TE>
<TE>   The tensions boiled over April 21. A group of Palestinians went on
a rampage through the Armenian monastery, whose monks had remained
more distant than those from the Greek Orthodox and Franciscan
orders.</TE>
<TE>   The men roamed from room to room, breaking in doors in a desperate
search for food. They confronted the bishop, stealing a gold chain
from his neck and breaking a cross.</TE>
<TE>   "All the rooms have been damaged. They have broken into the
monastery searching for food. They looted everything," said an
Armenian priest reached inside the church.</TE>
<TE>   The vandalism, which spread to the Greek Orthodox monastery as
well, prompted an ultimatum from the Rev. Ibrahim Faltas, an Egyptian
priest at St. Catherine's church, which adjoins the Church of the
Nativity.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving you a 48-hour ultimatum," Faltas told those outside,
according to Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Nasser. "If you don't do
something, the priests will leave the church."</TE>
<TE>   The threat was clear: no priests, no protection for the
Palestinians inside.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, talks began.</TE>
<TE>   The two teams of negotiators sat down for the first time April 23.
Col. Aviv was head of the Israeli team, and local councilman Salah
Tamari was the coordinator for the Palestinian side.</TE>
<TE>   One result came quickly: The Israelis agreed that the two bodies
could be brought from the church. Palestinians inside chose nine
children to do the job.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the wanted men soon became the stickiest point in the
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   At least two of the militants had come to be seen as leaders
inside the church. The same acts that made them wanted in Israel had
turned them into heroes among many Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim Abeiyat, the head of the local Al Aqsa brigade, told The
Times in March that he ordered the killing of an Israeli settler.</TE>
<TE>   Abdallah Daud Kader, head of the Palestinian's local intelligence
division, has been accused of weapons smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli government wanted the men to stand trial in Israel or
be sent into exile. The Palestinians saw this as a dangerous
precedent and insisted that the men stay in the Palestinian
territories to face trial there.</TE>
<TE>   Questions also surrounded the fate of the other men inside the
church. Israel wants to question every one of them, but the
Palestinians have resisted, fearing that they may be tortured or
unfairly imprisoned.</TE>
<TE>   After six days, during which two more Palestinians were killed by
snipers and two others wounded, talks broke down Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Low-level negotiations continue, however, mostly centered on the
release of those inside the church who want to leave. Twenty-six
people emerged Tuesday, and more groups are expected.</TE>
<TE>   Although negotiations remained frozen Wednesday, the resolution of
the siege of Arafat's Ramallah headquarters brought new hope to the
process--and could provide a model for ending the crisis in
Bethlehem.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians have said they are prepared to accept U.S. or
British wardens to oversee the transfer, trial and imprisonment of
any of the wanted men inside the church.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has not publicly ruled out such a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Some Palestinians are predicting a resolution within a few
days--possibly in time for Greek Orthodox Easter this Sunday. Others
are less hopeful.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, two peoples, three religions and multiple nations
continue struggling to find a way out of one of the most difficult
crises to face the church in its long history.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bethlehem Mayor Nasser: "It is a mess."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Rebecca Trounson in Bethlehem contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Communists Play Second Fiddle</HD>
<DH>Trends: They're still Russia's largest political party, but
a May Day rally shows they're no longer the biggest draw. Putin is in
charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Communist leader Gennady A. Zyuganov, perspiration beading on his
forehead, climbed down from the speaker's platform Wednesday after a
speech urging the government's resignation, and posed with elderly
supporters. It had been a fair-sized May Day rally, yet there still
was a sense of futility written on his ruddy face.</LD>
<LD>   Although tens of thousands of people had turned out under sunny
skies for the party's annual march, there was little evidence of the
seething anger that Communists claim is stirring in Russian society.</LD>
<LD>   And there was little reason to believe that the demonstration
would change anything.</LD>
<TE>   "The government has deteriorated into a criminal dictatorship that
imposes conditions of banditry all across the country," Zyuganov told
The Times before stomping away behind a phalanx of bodyguards. "The
conduct of the government is supported by 5-10% of the population at
most."</TE>
<TE>   Be that as it may, pro-Kremlin parties and trade unions loyal to
President Vladimir V. Putin brought more than 100,000 people to Red
Square, dwarfing the 40,000 or so supporters that the Communists
could muster to their meeting in front of the nearby Bolshoi Theater.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, the Communists style themselves as the only real
opposition voice in Russia, saying most other groups have been
co-opted into a broad coalition directed by Putin's Kremlin. But even
die-hard Communists wonder whether anybody is listening to their
demands and whether their party, Russia's largest with more than
500,000 members, is capable of standing up to Putin.</TE>
<TE>   Zyuganov said he believes that in general the country "is waking
up" and showing more active opposition to Putin. But he did not sound
very convinced, nor did many of the people who attended Wednesday's
rally.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't really see results," said Vladimir Derevyansky, a
38-year-old physics teacher from Kharkiv, Ukraine, who is working in
Russia. "This is miserably too few people for such a big city."</TE>
<TE>   The teacher, attired in a frayed shirt and plastic-rimmed
spectacles, said issues being raised by Communists--corruption, high
prices, the collapse of industry and education, and the loss of the
country's prestige--are important to most citizens, especially those
living outside Moscow. And yet, few bother to demonstrate.</TE>
<TE>   He said it only shows how firmly Putin's people have control of
the situation: "They have managed not only to fool the people, but to
turn them into zombies."</TE>
<TE>   Since Putin assumed the presidency in 2000, he and his allies have
worked to reduce chaos in the countryside and impose discipline on
the news media, regional governors, big industries and wayward
tycoons. The pro-Putin political bloc has an effective majority in
parliament, and has enacted several economic measures, including
private land sales, a 13% flat income tax and a new labor code that
were anathema to the Communists.</TE>
<TE>   Irina Pishchikova, a 50-year-old oil industry engineer at the
Zyuganov rally, said she was not sure the current Communist Party
leadership was up to the challenge of providing an alternative to
Putin's camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it has exhausted itself as an opposition already," she
said. "Oh, there are honest people in the party, but I am talking
about the leaders--they have been too well fed by the authorities. It
is time to let the younger people run it."</TE>
<TE>   Alexei V. Kuznetsov of The Times' Moscow Bureau contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>1 Million Marchers Take to Streets of France to Protest
Against Le Pen</HD>
<DH>Europe: Interest in Sunday's presidential runoff increases
the crowds attending May Day events.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>More than 1 million people marched through the streets of France on
Wednesday in peaceful demonstrations against Jean-Marie Le Pen, the
far-right candidate challenging incumbent President Jacques Chirac in
Sunday's runoff election.</LD>
<LD>   The protests were part of the traditional marches held on the May
1 workers' holiday. But Wednesday's turnout was far greater than
usual and included a broad spectrum of political parties, social
activists and families with no particular ideological affiliation.</LD>
<LD>   Le Pen's surprise success in last month's first-round election
stunned previously apathetic voters, many of whom apparently find his
aggressive nationalism unacceptable. Anti-Le Pen events have taken
place daily since the 71-year-old former paratrooper won 17% of the
vote April 21, eliminating Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
from the presidential race.</LD>
<TE>   Le Pen held his own march Wednesday in Paris, which was guarded by
3,500 extra uniformed riot police, plainclothes officers and police
helicopters. He led partisans down the elegant Rue de Rivoli to an
equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, the martyred national heroine whose
battles against the British make her a favorite symbol of his
National Front party.</TE>
<TE>   Scoffing at pollsters who predict an easy victory for the
center-right Chirac, Le Pen declared that the working class had
broken with an aloof, elitist left, and that he was the workers' new
champion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here by the tens of thousands to celebrate Joan of Arc and
the workers of France," Le Pen said, though authorities estimated his
crowd at about 10,000. Le Pen declared that the "earth is shaking
beneath the feet" of Chirac and other establishment politicians.</TE>
<TE>   National Front marchers said their leader had been falsely painted
as a fascist demagogue because he speaks the plain, hard truth. Le
Pen's campaign focuses on rising crime, the North African immigrants
he blames for it, and the European Union, from which he wants France
to withdraw immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "During the campaign I was heartbroken by the media manipulation,"
said Jean Pierre, 47. "In the past few years both of my daughters
have been assaulted by young men of foreign backgrounds. I'm sick of
it. You know the French are not racists. They've simply seen too many
people exploit the system."</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging Le Pen's slim chances of becoming president, other
marchers hoped that his rise would propel the National Front in
June's legislative elections.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away near the Place de la Bastille, police estimated,
400,000 people took part in the anti-Le Pen march. It was so big that
some people followed the crowd on side streets. Along with union
members, there were environmental activists, human rights groups and
families with children and dogs in tow. Brazilian drummers and
Caribbean steel bands provided music.</TE>
<TE>   Other large rallies were held in Lyon, Strasbourg, Lille and
Marseille.</TE>
<TE>   In Paris, a sea of signs denounced Le Pen, whose longtime
association with fascist, anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant sentiments
has been condemned by mainstream politicians. Many banners simply
said "No."</TE>
<TE>   Marchers criticized the voters who stayed away from the polls in
record numbers last month, a key factor allowing Le Pen to finish
ahead of Jospin.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the true problem is among the people who didn't bother to
vote," said a 31-year-old unemployed man who identified himself only
as Sebastien. He plans to vote for Chirac, although he voted last
month for one of many marginal leftist candidates who divided the
traditionally powerful left.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all here hoping that Chirac will win, even though he's not
my cup of tea," Sebastien said.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the anti-Le Pen demonstration reflected a sudden wave
of activism after years of apathy, boredom and disgust with
traditional politics, marchers said. They wondered, however, if this
new political interest will endure, or simply evaporate after
Sunday's election.</TE>

<HD>Israel Ends Monthlong Arafat Siege</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinians converge on the leader's Ramallah
compound as six men are handed over to U.S., British guards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israel's siege of Yasser Arafat's headquarters ended early today
after tanks roared away as part of a deal allowing six Palestinian
men wanted by Israel to be spirited off to a desert prison under
American and British guard.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of Palestinians converged on Arafat's battered compound
in the dead of night to celebrate his freedom. Looking at first
enraged, and later tired, Arafat told The Times and other media that
he was appreciative of the diplomatic breakthrough. But he said he
was more immediately worried about midnight violence at the Church of
the Nativity in Bethlehem, where a volatile standoff continued.</LD>
<LD>   On the front steps of Arafat's headquarters, dozens of uniformed
policemen who had been holed up with the Palestinian Authority
president waved AK-47s and flags, cheered and kissed friends they had
not seen for a month. One wounded man was carried away on a stretcher
to a waiting ambulance, flashing a V for victory to the applause of
the surging crowd.</LD>
<TE>   The end of the siege removes an explosive point of confrontation
that has inflamed tensions here. But for Arafat, freedom is relative.</TE>
<TE>   He emerges to a devastated political and physical landscape, his
government and most of his territory in ruins and his international
stature in question. In the short term, he has gained popularity
among many Palestinians who sympathized with his suffering, which
they likened to their own. He now has to perform once again as a
leader.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon sent tanks and troops to
surround Arafat on March 29 following a wave of horrific suicide
bombings that culminated with an attack on a hotel full of Jews
celebrating the Passover Seder. Sharon declared Arafat an enemy of
Israel and set about putting an end to his rule.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Ramallah, Israeli forces invaded nearly every
Palestinian city in the West Bank, their biggest military operation
in Palestinian territories since the lands were captured by Israel 35
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The impasse over Arafat's confinement was resolved by a compromise
proposed by President Bush. Israel had demanded custody of the six
wanted Palestinians inside the compound, five of them involved in the
assassination of a far-right Israeli Cabinet minister last year.</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, the six men will remain in Palestinian custody in
Jericho. That custody, however, will be supervised by U.S. and
British guards who will be stationed in Jericho. Israel has
complained that when Palestinian officials arrest suspects, they
quickly release them.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said he hoped that
the release of Arafat would eventually lead the two sides back to
peace talks, and predicted worse violence if it did not.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat had already been under virtual house arrest since December.
But after the bloody month of March, Sharon tightened the noose.
Tanks destroyed the outer walls of the Palestinian leader's compound
and troops invaded numerous buildings, searching room to room and,
according to the Palestinians, setting up sniper positions in a
building facing the place where Arafat slept.</TE>
<TE>   In his first comments to the media early today, Arafat expressed
his fury over events in Bethlehem. He banged the table, waved his
hands in scolding fashion and bored his eyes into a questioner.
Veteran Palestinian journalists said they had never seen him so
angry.</TE>
<TE>   He blamed the Israelis for a firefight and fiery explosions at the
Church of the Nativity, which is traditionally held to be the
birthplace of Jesus. He said the Israelis were terrorists, racists
and Nazis for what he termed an attack on the church. Israel denies
it attacked the church.</TE>
<TE>   "How can the world keep silent to these ugly crimes?" Arafat said.
"It is not important what happens to me. What's important is what's
happening at the church."</TE>
<TE>   He abruptly cut short the news conference and stormed out.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when meeting with The Times, he seemed calmer. He looked
pale and exhausted and again returned to the problem of Bethlehem.
"What is happening is a big crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat had retreated to an upper-floor conference room with
subdued lighting, where he greeted a steady parade of government
ministers and other well-wishers. A young girl presented him with a
box of chocolate Mars bars.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon's actions succeeded in isolating and weakening Arafat, but
the isolation was not complete. Arafat, meanwhile, can point to
having survived the showdown.</TE>
<TE>   It was not yet clear where Arafat would go when he finally emerged
later today from his shell-battered, dust-caked refuge.</TE>
<TE>   "If he stays in the West Bank, he will have a lot of housecleaning
to do," said Ziyad Mousa, a lecturer at Bir Zeit University. Mousa
and other residents earlier Wednesday had inched to within a few
blocks of Arafat's compound to try to catch a glimpse of the
goings-on.</TE>
<TE>   Mousa, like a growing number of Palestinians, said the time had
come for Arafat to build a government that is less corrupt, hold
elections and crack down on Islamic extremists. But he said Arafat
will also have to continue to lead "resistance" to Israeli occupation
while discouraging the suicide bombers, who have undermined the
Palestinian cause.</TE>
<TE>   Later, when the crowds were able to overrun the compound, they
proclaimed victory. Especially in the siege's early days,
Palestinians at the complex and Israeli soldiers occasionally shot at
each other across a pavement of several yards. At least two
Palestinians and one Israeli were killed. But in the final weeks, the
standoff had settled into monotony, with food and water in short
supply and electricity sporadic.</TE>
<TE>   Holed up inside the inner offices of the compound with Arafat were
four men the Palestinians have convicted of killing far-right Israeli
Tourism Minister Rehavam Zeevi, along with the man Israel accuses of
ordering the assassination and the alleged mastermind behind an
illegal arms-smuggling operation.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon vowed that his army would not withdraw until the
Palestinians handed the men over to Israel. After ignoring repeated
U.S. demands to pull troops out of the West Bank areas he had
reoccupied, Sharon eventually agreed to the compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "We now expect to see Arafat translate his words into deed and to
actively fight terror emanating from his own society," Israeli
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Sofer said.</TE>
<TE>   The transfer of the prisoners was carried out with a convoy of
bulletproof American Suburbans and British Land Rovers, accompanied
by Israeli armored cars. The convoy entered the compound just before
dusk. About two hours later, the full complement of 18 vehicles
streamed out.</TE>
<TE>   The removal of the prisoners came after a long day of waiting and
brinkmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials accused Arafat of reneging on the deal and of
balking at tranferring two of the six men. Israel claimed he wanted
to retain Ahmed Saadat, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, and Fuad Shubaki, the Palestinian Authority's top
financial officer and Arafat's accountant.</TE>
<TE>   But Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo denied that
it was Arafat who was balking. Other Palestinian officials suggested
that the delay was over details such as whether the prisoners would
emerge handcuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, residents occasionally ventured to a waiting
area several blocks from the compound. Among those who arrived hoping
for a glimpse of the prisoners was Saadat's wife, Abla. She had not
been able to speak to her husband since the Israeli invasion March
29.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to say how I feel.... We have no idea what the
future will be now," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Saadat is accused of ordering the assassination of Zeevi, who was
gunned down in an East Jerusalem hotel, in retaliation for Israel's
earlier assassination of the previous PFLP leader.</TE>

<HD>New Assaults Raise Fears Along Border of Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Military: Outbreak lends credence to fears of an offensive
by Taliban and Al Qaeda holdouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Afghan politicians and coalition forces Wednesday reported fresh
assaults from presumed Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters in the lawless
eastern border area with Pakistan, giving credence to fears of a
looming offensive by holdouts loyal to Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   Afghan and U.S. sources also confirmed new outbreaks of fighting
among factions in the north and east, suggesting a steady unraveling
of the unified support that ethnic rivals had pledged to the interim
government of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai.</LD>
<LD>   "Perhaps the enemies of peace will make the most efforts to
disrupt the situation in these last weeks before the loya jirga,"
Foreign Minister Abdullah said of the clashes. The loya jirga, a
convention of tribal elders expected to select the next government,
begins its deliberations in Kabul on June 10.</LD>
<TE>   "Taliban and Al Qaeda are present in Pakistan, there is no doubt,"
he told reporters after meeting with his visiting Japanese
counterpart, Yoriko Kawaguchi. But he insisted that authorities in
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, are aligned with those in Kabul,
the Afghan capital, and the U.S.-led coalition in their determination
to thwart destabilization of this country ravaged by a
quarter-century of occupation and civil war.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai's 30-member Cabinet has been struggling to hold the
fractious ethnic groups together since it was inaugurated more than
four months ago, and concerns are widespread that the infighting is
accelerating.</TE>
<TE>   Vicious disputes between rival Afghan warlords appear to be
complicating preparations by coalition forces to counter any renewed
offensive around the eastern city of Khowst and in the seething
tribal areas of Pakistan along the Afghan border.</TE>
<TE>   Early today, British Brig. Roger Lane at Bagram air base confirmed
that about 1,000 coalition troops have begun a major operation in the
mountains of southeastern Afghanistan. The British-led Operation
Snipe will be supported by U.S. air power and special operations
troops, an American spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops of the elite 101st Airborne Division are being
deployed to back up several hundred British marines in the Khowst
area. Rugged mountain terrain and deep anti-American sentiments in
the region have long provided a haven for Bin Laden foot soldiers
driven from power by the U.S.-backed Northern Alliance in November.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces using a trade school as a base in Miranshah, just
across the border in Pakistan, were fired on early Wednesday in a
barrage originating from Afghan soil, local officials said. No one
was injured, but the harassment demonstrated the lurking hostilities
toward a U.S. presence in the area.</TE>
<TE>   The area had been leafleted in recent days by a group calling
itself the Moujahedeen of North Waziristan, warning that anyone
supporting "the hypocrite rulers" of the interim Kabul government
would be dishonoring the Islamic faith.</TE>
<TE>   Local warlords whom the coalition forces have previously relied on
for intelligence have increasingly used their clout with U.S. forces
to call in strikes against their Afghan rivals.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the U.S. general commanding ground troops in
Afghanistan hinted that coalition forces are now wary of further
cooperation with Bacha Khan, who helped drive the Taliban out of his
region last winter. After a barrage of artillery fire in recent days
killed 30 civilians, Army Maj. Gen. Frank L. Hagenbeck observed that
although Bacha Khan had once been an ally, "there are no permanent
alliances."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the first planeload of pro-Taliban prisoners since
February arrived Wednesday at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay.
About 30 detainees were transported without incident. The 300
detainees already in Cuba were moved from temporary outdoor cages to
a new indoor facility on Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   And the North Atlantic Treaty Organization announced that it will
end anti-terrorism surveillance flights over New York and Washington
on May 16.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer John Hendren in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf Sweeps Vote Amid Charges of Fraud</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Rights panel, opposition cry foul as 98% support
five more years for the president in a special referendum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>President Pervez Musharraf claimed a powerful mandate from Pakistani
voters Wednesday while an independent human rights commission and
opposition parties charged that a referendum on extending the army
general's rule was marred by massive fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 98% of the ballots cast in Tuesday's referendum supported
Musharraf's bid for five more years, said the country's chief
election commissioner, Irshad Hassan Khan.</LD>
<LD>   But opposition parties, the human rights commission and newspapers
reported that ballot-box stuffing and other abuses were widespread.</LD>
<TE>   About 42.8 million Pakistanis voted in favor of extending the term
of Musharraf, who was the only one on the ballot, while 883,676 voted
no, the election commission said. Another 282,935 ballots were
invalidated. Voter turnout was almost 70%, the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Information Minister Nisar Memon said he found the turnout
surprising, since it has averaged only 40% in the last four elections
between 1988 and 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The many, serious irregularities mean that Musharraf's claim to a
mandate "is very tainted," said Afrasaib Khattak, head of the human
rights commission, in a telephone interview from Peshawar. "The
turnout figure is grossly exaggerated. And the state machinery, the
government institutions, have heavily intervened in favor of the
president."</TE>
<TE>   Memon accused opposition parties of trying to discredit the
referendum by coming up with what he called ridiculous numbers to
support their claim that 90% of voters boycotted the referendum.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposition has been summarily rejected, and now they should
accept the verdict of the people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf held the referendum, rather than run for election, in an
effort to legitimize the power he seized in 1999. He is a crucial
ally as U.S. forces step up covert operations against suspected Al
Qaeda and Taliban fighters in unruly tribal areas along the Afghan
border.</TE>
<TE>   The human rights commission recently accused Musharraf of going
back on his promise to crack down on extremists by quietly releasing
thousands of people rounded up amid great publicity earlier this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Khattak said that Tuesday's referendum has weakened rather than
strengthened Musharraf's legitimacy among Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he has lost the benefit of the doubt, which some people
were prepared to give him initially," Khattak said.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition, now a loose alliance of mainstream political
parties, religious groups and nongovernmental organizations, called
for Musharraf to resign, insisting that the turnout was no more than
10% of eligible voters.</TE>
<TE>   Turnout estimates are at best a guess because there was no
official voter list. The total electorate was estimated to be just
under 62 million.</TE>
<TE>   But Musharraf lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, and the last
national census was in 1998, so the number of eligible voters is
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf also declared the country a single constituency so
people could vote anywhere they wanted. And he more than doubled the
number of polling stations, which Khattak and other critics said
opened the door to fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Polling stations that served about 1,000 people had 3,000 ballots,
Khattak alleged.</TE>
<TE>   "We have examples of people who have voted twice or thrice," said
the human rights official. "And we have examples of stuffing ballot
boxes by relevant authorities in stations where no one had voted at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Reports from several parts of the country said government workers
had been ordered to vote for Musharraf, and that they were
transported to polling stations to ensure they did.</TE>
<TE>   Memon, Musharraf's information minister, dismissed the reports as
fabrications.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is, again, in the domain of imagination, in the
domain of opposition for the sake of opposition," he told a news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Khattak said his commission deployed monitors in all of Pakistan's
150 districts, and they reported serious irregularities. Newspapers
were filled with stories Wednesday such as that of a polling officer
at a government-run teachers college who was spotted stamping ballot
papers with "yes" votes.</TE>
<TE>   The woman told reporters that the college principal had ordered
her to complete 500 ballots even though only 150 people had voted.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition parties and pro-democracy activists had asked the
Supreme Court to declare Musharraf's referendum unconstitutional, but
the justices ruled Saturday that the vote could go ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The court ruled that Musharraf was not violating the constitution
because he had suspended it two days after the coup.</TE>

<HD>An Exhausted Arafat Is Greeted by Crowd</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Cheering, whistling and honking car horns, hundreds of jubilant
Palestinians swarmed in the dead of night to the wrecked buildings
where Yasser Arafat had lately been staring down Israeli tanks.</LD>
<LD>   They had to wade through a sea of churning dust, step past the
shells of crushed cars and avoid the barbed wire left behind when
Israeli troops evacuated the premises less than an hour before.</LD>
<LD>   There, on the front steps of what's left of Arafat's compound, the
crowds joined with a small contingent of Palestinian policemen and a
motley crew of international peace activists, all of whom were
enjoying their first minutes of freedom after spending weeks trapped
with Arafat.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel free! I feel victorious!" declared Rashid Hilal, a
journalist with Voice of Palestine radio who had shown up for work
the morning of March 29 to cover the start of Israel's invasion of
Ramallah and ended up being caught inside.</TE>
<TE>   With a new beard and clothes a little looser, Hilal emerged with a
roll of papers under his arm, notes he had kept as a daily diary,
which he sometimes telephoned out to listeners.</TE>
<TE>   The ordeal, he insisted, was worth it "because we showed that the
Palestinian people have steadfasted." He used the word that has
become a verb in the Palestinian lexicon--"to steadfast."</TE>
<TE>   But steadfasting can be a messy thing, and inside the three-story
building where Arafat and a couple of hundred other people spent most
of their time, there were the signs and smells of life under siege.
Crumpled mattresses and blankets lined a corridor; floors were sticky
and trash was strewn everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat awaited the reporters who also rushed the compound. He sat
at a long table flanked by aides and guards. He appeared enraged,
yelling at his questioners for focusing on him instead of Bethlehem
and branding the Israelis everything from terrorists to Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   "How could the world possibly be silent about this atrocious
crime," he said. "I don't care if this room I'm sitting in blows up.
What concerns me is what is happening at the Church of the Nativity.
This is a crime that cannot be forgiven."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Palestinians have been holed up in the Bethlehem
church for a month after rushing inside to escape Israeli troops.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat turned on the journalists.</TE>
<TE>   "Go away, all of you. Go and tell the world about this crime.
Don't talk to me," he said, before his aides took him away.</TE>
<TE>   He calmed later, and as angry as he had been, he also clearly
relished the moment. As tired as his aides insisted he was--and he
did look exhausted and pale--he continued to receive well-wishers and
journalists well into the wee hours of the morning.</TE>
<TE>   He later told an interviewer that he planned to tour the sites of
Israeli destruction in the West Bank, the results of a monthlong
offensive launched by Israel after a wave of deadly suicide bombings
aimed at Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd on the front steps, meanwhile, celebrated and struck a
defiant note. Uniformed policemen waved their AK-47s and kissed and
embraced each other and friends who arrived. They mostly seemed glad
it was all over.</TE>
<TE>   They told of surviving on rations of bread or water, less or more
depending on what the Israelis delivered.</TE>
<TE>   In short order, Palestinian backhoes were tearing down barbed wire
and clearing the huge dirt-and-debris barriers that Israeli forces
had placed to block many of the roads in Ramallah, especially the
ones leading to the compound.</TE>

<HD>Last-Minute Effort to Salvage Jenin Inquiry Fails</HD>
<DH>West Bank: U.N. investigation of refugee camp will be
officially canceled today, Annan says. Palestinians blame Israeli
'recalcitrance.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The ill-fated U.N. investigative mission to the Jenin refugee camp in
the West Bank will be officially called off today, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, citing what he called fundamental
and apparently nonnegotiable Israeli objections to the inquiry.</LD>
<LD>   Though Arab nations proposed a draft resolution to the Security
Council late Wednesday that would countermand Annan's move and demand
Israeli cooperation with an investigation, the United States appeared
poised to veto any such initiative, and other council members voiced
support for Annan's decision.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter presented to council members Wednesday afternoon,
Annan said it was his "intention to disband the fact-finding team
tomorrow," and he expressed regret that "the long shadow cast by
recent events in the Jenin refugee camp will remain in the absence of
such a fact-finding exercise."</LD>
<TE>   After the Israeli security Cabinet voted Tuesday against
cooperation with the United Nations probe--under the terms U.N.
officials had negotiated with Israeli representatives here--Annan
said in the letter he "was drawn reluctantly to the conclusion" that
it would be impossible to produce "an accurate, thorough and balanced
report."</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the full cooperation of both sides was a precondition
for this, as was a visit to the area itself to see the Jenin refugee
camp and at first hand to gather information," Annan wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the cancellation, blaming
not Annan but Israeli "recalcitrance," and they charged again that
Israel committed "war crimes" in its three-week occupation of the
camp. But Palestinians are beginning to accept estimates from
independent human-rights sources that the deaths in Jenin numbered in
the scores, not the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser Kidwa, the Palestinian representative here, said that
although Palestinian officials had said "thousands" of residents were
missing from the camp, "missing does not mean killed, obviously." But
Israel's refusal to permit U.N. aid workers and Red Crescent medical
teams into the camp was a violation of international humanitarian
law, Kidwa said. "War crimes were committed," he asserted. "That is
an established fact."</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli ambassador here, Yehuda Lancry, said Wednesday that 47
armed Palestinian men were killed by Israeli troops during the Jenin
siege, along with seven Palestinian "civilians"; 23 Israeli soldiers
also died, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no atrocities; there was no massacre; there was a
fierce battle between Palestinian gunmen and the Israeli army,"
Lancry said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Wednesday, the Bush administration said it still supported
the Jenin inquiry, which it had first officially endorsed in a
U.S.-sponsored Security Council resolution April 13. "The president
called for transparency and the president called for the facts to be
found," said Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary. "And the
United States is working to try to help reach an agreement between
Israel and the United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. diplomats at the U.N. said they would not seek to revive
the inquiry once Annan had made a decision to disband the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Some veteran diplomats here who are normally admirers of the
secretary-general said privately that Annan and his aides had
mishandled the initial organization of the inquiry, and then misread
Israeli objections.</TE>
<TE>   By naming a refugee rights advocate and a former Red Cross chief
to two of the three executive positions on the team, Annan
inadvertently signaled to the Israelis that the group's focus would
be on Palestinian victims and humanitarian aid issues, to the
exclusion of the security problems that triggered the Israeli
incursion, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli misgivings increased when Annan agreed to name William
Nash, a retired U.S. major general who runs the Center for Preventive
Action at the Council of Foreign Relations, but refused Israeli
requests that he be appointed to a leadership role.</TE>
<TE>   "There should have been more consultation with the host government
before appointing the members," said David Philips, Nash's deputy at
the center. "The composition of the initial group created the
impression that the mission was being politicized."</TE>
<TE>   The original call for a U.N. investigation came when hundreds of
Israeli troops were still inside the camp, battling Palestinian
gunmen and denying access to the scene to journalists, humanitarian
aid workers and U.N. officials with administrative responsibility for
the camp. The Israeli Defense Ministry itself initially said as many
as 200 Palestinians might have died in the fighting.</TE>
<TE>   There was intense pressure on Annan--not just from Arab countries,
but from within the U.N. staff here and in the West Bank, U.N.
officials said--to undertake a thorough investigation. The specter of
"another Srebenica" was raised in the Security Council. The reference
had especially unnerving resonance for Annan, who was in charge of
U.N. peacekeeping operations at the time of the 1995 massacre in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   "With his own people in the field being affected, he could not
simply ignore this," said one of his aides, who asked not to be
named.</TE>

<HD>West Bank Conflict Emboldens Iraqi Negotiating Team at U.N.</HD>
<DH>Sanctions: Baghdad delegation arrives to seek assurances
from Security Council on inspections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>For Saddam Hussein, the juxtaposition could not be more felicitous:
As Iraq's foreign minister arrived here Wednesday for new talks on
weapons inspections, the United Nations was again embroiled in debate
on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--a conflict that Baghdad believes
could provide the best possible protection from any U.S. military
action.</LD>
<LD>   The Iraqis want U.N. officials to provide answers to questions
they posed during their last visit two months ago--20 questions, to
be precise, including requests for assurances that inspectors would
not be Western spies and demands for an assessment of American plans
"for invading Iraq and overthrowing its national government by
force."</LD>
<LD>   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was expected to tell Iraqi
Foreign Minister Naji Sabri that some of his concerns can be
addressed only by the Security Council. And the council has said Iraq
must comply with its inspection demands before other issues are
addressed.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going to be discussing the implementation of Security
Council resolutions, and we will discuss the return of the
inspectors, but obviously there must be something on the minds of the
Iraqis that they would also want to put on the table," Annan said
shortly before the talks began Wednesday. "I would hope that we can
spend a considerable amount of time on the return of the inspectors."</TE>
<TE>   Hans Blix, who heads the U.N. inspection team that would be
dispatched to Iraq, has been instructed to respond to technical and
logistical issues raised by the Iraqis.</TE>
<TE>   Among them: How long would the inspections last and would
inspectors respect Iraq's "sovereignty, independence and territorial
integrity?" (Blix said the team could need up to a year and must have
the right to travel freely and conduct surprise inspections anywhere
in Iraq.)</TE>
<TE>   Sabri was accompanied by a 15-member delegation of senior
diplomats, advisors and military officers, an indication that Iraq is
prepared for detailed negotiations here. Iraqi and U.N. officials in
the talks declined to comment about the substance of discussions,
which are scheduled to continue through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Western diplomats here are divided in their analysis of Iraq's
intentions, with some saying they believe that Baghdad is ready to
readmit inspectors to forestall American military action as part of a
global war on terrorism, and others doubting that Hussein would risk
the discovery of the weapons of mass destruction they believe his
government is hiding.</TE>
<TE>   But Iraq's sense of urgency about U.N. inspection demands appears
to have diminished of late, diplomats concur.</TE>
<TE>   Sabri arrived here Wednesday exuding a new confidence: At the
recent Arab League summit in Lebanon, his government won unanimous
opposition to U.N. sanctions, thanks to the unusual Arab solidarity
provoked by Israel's reoccupation of the West Bank. Iraq then
postponed its original plans for a mid-April resumption of talks at
the U.N., saying it did not want to distract attention from the
Palestinian issue.</TE>
<TE>   And, in what it termed a protest against U.S. support for Israel,
it suspended oil sales for at least 30 days, forgoing as much as $1
billion in income.</TE>
<TE>   When the Iraqis were last here in early March, they were very much
on the defensive: American military threats sounded increasingly
pointed and credible, the Security Council had recently endorsed a
strengthened sanctions regime, and even major Arab states backed
council demands that Baghdad reopen its doors to weapons inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Annan said then that his conversations would be strictly limited
to securing Iraq's fulfillment of Security Council resolutions
adopted after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The council imposed
strict sanctions that can be lifted only if U.N. inspectors confirm
that Iraq neither holds nor is trying to build chemical, biological
or nuclear weapons, or missiles with the capacity to deliver the
weapons beyond its borders.</TE>
<TE>   A previous U.N. inspection team pulled out of Iraq in December
1998, shortly before U.S. and British warplanes launched punitive
airstrikes against the country. The inspectors complained then that
they had routinely been denied access to known or suspected Iraqi
military installations.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraq has now signaled to the secretary-general: Let's talk about
compliance," Fred Eckhard, Annan's spokesman, said last month after
Iraq formally requested this second round of discussions. "The
secretary-general is not empowered to talk about anything other than
full compliance."</TE>
<TE>   But now, after being literally and diplomatically embraced by the
Persian Gulf states and other Arab powers, Hussein's envoys appear to
believe that they are in a stronger negotiating position.</TE>
<TE>   They say they want a comprehensive review of their entire
relationship with the U.N. and are reviving requests for compensation
for economic and infrastructural damage they claim is attributable to
U.N. sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   Annan is scheduled to meet again with the Iraqis on Friday.</TE>

<HD>Tensions Take a Break as Hu and Bush Talk</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: China looks for calm during its leadership
transition period, but concerns about Taiwan have not abated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush met Wednesday with Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao,
who is expected to assume leadership of the world's most populous
nation next year, as U.S.-China relations waver despite growing
contacts on terrorism and trade.</LD>
<LD>   During their half-hour meeting in the Oval Office, Bush expressed
appreciation for China's support in the U.S.-led counter-terrorism
campaign and called for stronger ties, according to administration
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Bush "talked about the importance of U.S.-China relations and said
he is pleased with the relationship," White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said. "The president expressed his belief that the United
States and China can work well together on a wide range of issues."</LD>
<TE>   After the meeting, Hu described the talks as "quite good."</TE>
<TE>   In a speech Wednesday night, Hu said he was "deeply impressed" by
what he had seen and heard.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a strong feeling that although China and the U.S. differ
in historical background and cultural tradition, the two peoples are
eager to see the relationship grow," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the visit, Hu's debut on the world stage, comes as Beijing is
increasingly frustrated over Washington's policies toward Taiwan and
what China views as a Pentagon-driven effort to bolster the island's
military capabilities, according to U.S. and Chinese analysts. The
United States last year announced an arms sales package to Taiwan
that for the first time included submarines.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory, is the
foremost issue in dispute between the two nations.</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Hu called on the United States to "strictly honor"
its commitments to China on Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "Properly handling this question is the key to promoting our
constructive and cooperative relations," Hu said. "If any trouble
occurs on the Taiwan question, it would be difficult for China-U.S.
relations to move forward, and a retrogression may even occur."</TE>
<TE>   The arms sales package and a quiet upgrading of ties with Taipei
have led to growing concern in China and pressure on President Jiang
Zemin, who is scheduled to visit the United States this fall.</TE>
<TE>   "Jiang Zemin is under a great deal of pressure to demonstrate that
his conciliatory line to Washington is paying off, but so far there
is no evidence suggesting that it is," said Minxin Pei, a senior
associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a
Washington public policy center.</TE>
<TE>   China's leadership is confused by Bush's call for better
cooperation with Beijing while the administration is building up
security ties with Taipei, Pei said.</TE>
<TE>   China's need for calm as it begins the transition from Jiang's
leadership has prevented a major flap, analysts say. But any further
U.S. actions benefiting Taiwan could precipitate a showdown,
especially after the transition is complete. Hu is expected to become
head of China's Communist Party this fall and take over the country's
presidency next year.</TE>
<TE>   In his meeting with Hu, which lasted 10 minutes longer than
scheduled, Bush reiterated the long-standing U.S. policy favoring
peaceful resolution of differences between Taiwan and the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not wish to see provocation on either side of the Taiwan
Strait," Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Kenneth Lieberthal, a China scholar at the University of
Michigan who advised the National Security Council during Bill
Clinton's presidency, said the Bush administration has "pushed the
Taiwan issue both substantively and symbolically in a way that has
the effect of jerking China's chain. This is an issue poised to move
back to the center of the relationship."</TE>
<TE>   "Hu wants a good relationship. Bush does too. But there are very
serious issues that could turn this relationship in a bad direction
pretty quickly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A wide gap between the two countries on human rights issues was
evident Tuesday during Hu's visit to Capitol Hill, where he declined
to accept four letters from members of Congress appealing for release
of political prisoners and greater attention to human rights.</TE>
<TE>   Since Bush's second trip to China, in February, China has not
released any dissidents, according to Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration must step up the pressure. There's been no
improvement in human rights in China this year, and conditions
worsened in some ways last year," said Mike Jendrzejczyk of the
Washington office of Human Rights Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Beijing is also using the war on terrorism to justify a crackdown
on ethnic Uighurs in western region of Xinjiang, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Hu's visit, officially hosted by Vice President Dick Cheney,
focused on issues including human rights, terrorism, trade and
economic development, China's missile technology exports and U.S.
missile defense. Hu brought up Taiwan during dinner with Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell on Tuesday and during a luncheon with Cheney on
Wednesday, U.S. officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The visit is not expected to yield any formal agreements, although
the administration used it to prod China to curtail export of its
weapons technology to nations hostile to the United States. In turn,
Beijing wants Washington to lift an embargo that prevents American
companies from using Chinese rockets to launch satellites.</TE>
<TE>   "For very different reasons, China and the United States need this
visit to go smoothly. China wants nothing to interfere with an
orderly leadership transition in the fall. The United States wants
nothing to detract from a perception of global solidarity against
terrorism," said Kurt Campbell, director of the International
Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.</TE>

<HD>Policy Schism Widens Between U.S., Europe</HD>
<DH>Alliance: On the eve of an annual summit, friction is
apparent on a number of issues, from American support of Israel to
steel tariffs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When a succession of European leaders visited this city after Sept.
11, they came to express a new-felt solidarity with their U.S.
partners.</LD>
<LD>   But as they arrive for today's annual U.S.-European summit, they
are struggling with frictions that have erupted on issue after issue
since and have raised questions about the fundamental strength of the
transatlantic alliance.</LD>
<LD>   European leaders differ sharply with the Bush administration on
the Middle East, believing that U.S. policy has been too sympathetic
to the Israelis. The Europeans have challenged the administration's
willingness to mount a military campaign against Iraq and its seeming
inclination to use military force to deal with other threats as well.</LD>
<TE>   They are battling the Bush administration on steel tariffs in a
dispute that threatens to become a full-blown trade war. And they
complain that America no longer consults Europe first on global
security issues, as it did during the Cold War.</TE>
<TE>   Frictions between these huge powers are a perennial part of the
relationship. Yet this year's strains seem unusually intense and pose
at least two urgent questions: How much political and material
support will Europe give the United States in its campaign to
displace Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and in the broader
anti-terror campaign?</TE>
<TE>   The frictions spring from a growing gap between the opinions of
Americans and Europeans. Polls suggest that the Bush administration's
approach to the Mideast and the anti-terrorism fight has deepened
transatlantic disagreements, and it is leading Europeans to demand a
foreign policy distinct from that of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The differences also point to a longer-term divergence between the
interests of a wealthy and ever-more-unified Europe and a United
States that is increasingly focused on fast-growing Asia, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   The schism between the allies came jarringly into view earlier
this year, when European leaders began speaking with uncharacteristic
bluntness about the U.S. approach on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   There was predictable criticism from French and other diplomats
that Bush's focus on the "evil" of rogue regimes was simplistic. More
surprising, and perhaps more wounding, was criticism from a
conservative British politician, EU foreign policy commissioner Chris
Patten, that Washington had moved into "unilateralist overdrive" in
its pursuit of its terrorist adversary.</TE>
<TE>   As Washington has gotten more involved in the Middle East crisis,
the criticism from Europe has become more muted. The Europeans are
now deeply engaged in trying to get the White House to step up its
peace efforts there, and to at least put off until next year a
military confrontation with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   A senior State Department official contended this week that U.S.
officials were laying to rest European worries.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most of the European fears and apprehensions have been
taken care of," this official said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a European diplomat in Washington made clear that differences
remain.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism Seen as</TE>
<TE>   Distorting U.S. View</TE>
<TE>   Regional problems such as that in the Middle East have long and
complex histories and cannot be solved by military means, the
European said. The Bush administration, he said, "has tended to see
all the problems of the planet through the prism of the war on
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony J. Blinken, a foreign policy expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said it was widely
believed after Sept. 11 that the war on terrorism would be the glue
that held the transatlantic alliance together, as the Cold War had
held it together in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "what we've seen is there are very different perceptions
of the threat depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   A poll by the Pew Research Center, conducted in early April, found
that while the Sept. 11 attacks brought a welling of European
sympathy for the United States, Americans have not convinced
Europeans that the war on terrorism is their fight too.</TE>
<TE>   The poll indicated that in Britain, France, Italy and Germany,
majorities ranging from 68% to 80% believe the United States is
waging war on terrorism for its own interests, rather than for its
allies or humanity in general.</TE>
<TE>   The finding is significant because the United States is relying on
help from Europe to conduct various aspects of the anti-terrorism
campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The survey also showed marked differences on the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans, whose countries include growing Islamic populations,
were notably more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than to
Israel's. Europeans were also highly skeptical of U.S. plans for
military action in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, contended that European concerns are growing,
too, because of the view of some administration officials that U.S.
security and economic interests should now be focused on Asia rather
than Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a significant part of this administration that [thinks
that] Europe is no longer as relevant as it was a couple of years
ago," he told reporters at a recent lunch.</TE>
<TE>   But some argue that U.S.-European differences are not something to
fear.</TE>
<TE>   Ivo H. Daalder, a former National Security Council aide now at the
Brookings Institution think tank, said that during the last century,
U.S. foreign policy was focused on seeing that no single European
country dominated the continent.</TE>
<TE>   Now that this effort has succeeded, Europe is prosperous and
unified, and America and Europe don't need to suppress their
differing interests to maintain unity, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been growing irritation in Europe at the way the U.S. has
been throwing its weight around," he said. "But now there's no
necessity to agree; we can wallow in the luxury of disagreement."</TE>

<HD>Clinton Said to Want TV Talk Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former President Bill Clinton met with NBC executives Wednesday in
Los Angeles to discuss hosting his own talk show, according to
several television sources.</LD>
<LD>   Although the talks are only preliminary, one source said Clinton's
interest was serious and said he was demanding a fee of $50 million a
year and had aspirations "of becoming the next Oprah Winfrey."</LD>
<LD>   NBC officials would not comment Wednesday. And Clinton's office in
New York did not respond to an inquiry about the prospective talk
show.</LD>
<TE>   Clinton is in Los Angeles this week for a Democratic fund-raiser,
according to one person who will be attending.</TE>
<TE>   Television industry sources say chances are slim that Clinton
would commit to such a plan once he understands the demands of the
job. The 55-year-old former president has told some Hollywood
executives who have asked about a potential TV career that the rumors
are untrue.</TE>
<TE>   Television executives doubted that Clinton would sign up for a
demanding regimen of daily tapings for 39 weeks that such a show
would require.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, there is no precedent for such a TV deal with a former
president. Richard Nixon stirred controversy in 1975 when talk show
host David Frost paid him $600,000 for a series of interviews.</TE>
<TE>   Most presidents, after leaving the White House, typically sit on
corporate boards, take up humanitarian and charitable causes, write
books, make speeches and work on their libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts said Clinton also would risk his status as a world
statesman by aligning himself so closely with the issues common to
afternoon or late-night talk shows such as adultery, rape, child
abuse and teen pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   "The price he could pay is so much higher than the potential
payoff," said Robert Thompson, a professor of media and pop culture
at Syracuse University. "Clinton is obsessed with his legacy, and a
talk show is not the best way to erase Monica Lewinsky and the
impeachment and reposition himself in high school history books for
his positive achievements. How does he maintain his dignity if he
cashes in on his 'Animal House' presidency?"</TE>
<TE>   There was also speculation in TV circles this week that Clinton
was meeting with CBS. But Leslie Moonves, chief executive of CBS
Television, said his company has had no meeting with the former
president and called the idea of a Clinton talk show ridiculous. "Why
would he do it?" asked Moonves, who had close ties to the Clinton
White House.</TE>
<TE>   A CBS division syndicates "The Oprah Winfrey Show." But Winfrey
plans to quit her top-rated talk show in 2006 after 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, CBS has been looking for a political star to bring to
the small screen. The company has pursued former New York Mayor Rudy
Giuliani, who declined the offer, according to sources.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton has been making a handsome living since leaving the White
House. The former president is estimated to be pulling in as much as
$15 million a year from speeches that pay $125,000 to $300,000
apiece. That is on top of his $12-million book deal with Alfred A.
Knopf, which is the largest advance in history.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a top-rated talk show would be much more lucrative. Winfrey
has built a billion-dollar publishing and television empire on the
back of her talk show, which generates $300 million in revenue each
year. CBS's King World division pays her more than $125 million a
year to host the show and spends an estimated $40 million to produce
it.</TE>
<TE>   But TV executives have reservations about whether a Clinton show
would attract and sustain a large audience. Professor Thompson said
Clinton could turn a TV career to his advantage by using his
telegenic skills to interview world leaders and take on complex
topics such as Middle East peace and oil dependency.</TE>
<TE>   Yet television sources say Clinton is not interested in political
topics because of potential conflicts of interest as the spouse of
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   If Clinton proceeds with his plans for a talk show, it probably
would be produced by his close friends Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and
Harry Thomason, sources said. The husband and wife team are playing a
role in pitching Clinton's show to the networks. The Thomasons are
best-known as the executive producers of the 1980s CBS hit "Designing
Women," but their production company, Mozark Productions, has had
several other prime-time series, including "Evening Shade" and
"Hearts Afire."</TE>
<TE>   The Thomasons have known Clinton since he was governor of Arkansas
and have served as advisors at various times during his campaigns and
his presidency. The couple directed a 14-minute biographical sketch
that introduced Clinton at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   They are working on a movie documentary based on Joe Conason and
Gene Lyons' book, "The Hunting of the President: The Ten-Year
Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton."</TE>
<TE>   One rumor circulating Hollywood last week was that Clinton was a
candidate to replace CBS news anchor Bryant Gumbel. But one network
source said that job wouldn't pay enough.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As the last days of 2000 ticked by, Critical Path Inc. President
David Thatcher saw disaster rushing to swallow him.</LD>
<LD>   Thatcher knew the software company was going to fall short of the
$54 million in fourth-quarter sales it had promised Wall Street. The
bad news would surprise analysts, disappoint investors and hammer the
company's stock.</LD>
<LD>   Desperate to avoid such a fate, Thatcher encouraged Critical
Path's sales personnel to commit fraud. They persuaded an
ex-colleague working at a small concert and sports ticket brokerage
to sign a bogus contract for $2 million worth of Critical Path
software.</LD>
<TE>   The ticket broker was assured he would never actually receive the
software, though Critical Path immediately booked it as a sale. A
couple of days later, the software showed up on his desk. A Critical
Path sales executive told him to throw it away.</TE>
<TE>   While Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd. have been grabbing
headlines for financial chicanery, the tech community is quietly
awash in its own accounting scandals. The number of high-tech
companies issuing restatements--essentially admissions that previous
revenue reports were more vapor than reality--has at least quadrupled
since the early 1990s, according to New York University doctoral
candidate Min Wu. Tech companies now constitute nearly 40% of all
corporate restatements.</TE>
<TE>   Restatements almost always damage or destroy investor confidence
and spawn multiple lawsuits. In some cases, a restatement launches a
company on its death spiral.</TE>
<TE>   Clarent Corp., a Silicon Valley manufacturer of Internet telephone
software, said in September that it had significantly overstated its
revenue. Shares of Clarent, which traded at $178 two years ago, now
are about 30 cents each.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore.com, the Westlake Village real estate Web site, has
restated its results for much of the last two years, shrinking them
dramatically. The stock, which hit $120 during the dot-com boom, is
trading at less than $3.</TE>
<TE>   Quintus Corp., a business software maker based in the East Bay
that had a market value of $1 billion, filed for bankruptcy
protection after acknowledging that much of its 2000 revenue was
based on "falsified documentation."</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past several years, we have sued many tech companies,
sought tougher sanctions, referred more cases to the criminal
authorities, and yet people are still committing accounting fraud,"
said Helane Morrison, the SEC's chief in the Bay Area. "They just
haven't stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Few companies tried to get away with more than Critical Path.
During its brief heyday, it was in the vanguard of high-tech upstarts
that were supposed to destroy the dinosaurs of the "old economy."
This was a pleasant fantasy that masked an ugly truth: Critical Path
was a multibillion-dollar con game.</TE>
<TE>   Thatcher, who pleaded guilty in February to securities fraud in
U.S. District Court in San Francisco, told the judge that other
members of the company's management were in on it. "The object of
this conspiracy," he said, "was to report false revenues to meet
Critical Path's predicted financial results."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, the executives found themselves in the position of
having to commit fraud merely to reach the revenue targets they had
set themselves. Those targets offered the illusion that Critical Path
was everything the media and analyst hype said it was.</TE>
<TE>   "They used accounting to try to manufacture a reality that wasn't
there," said Bill McGlashan Jr., who was brought in to run Critical
Path last year after the fraud was exposed. "That's insanity. It's
like, what were you thinking?"</TE>
<TE>   Internet mania peaked only two years ago, but already it feels
like another lifetime--an era when young entrepreneurs, often
equipped with no more than a good story and a sincere desire to be
rich, received tens of millions in funding from venture capitalists.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting companies often were taken public before they had
reaped enough revenue to buy a house in a middle-class San Francisco
neighborhood, but that didn't matter. For a while, everyone made a
fortune and looked like a genius.</TE>
<TE>   Company Was Hyped</TE>
<TE>   as a Digital Visionary</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path was founded in early 1997 by David Hayden, the
former chief executive of Magellan, an Internet directory that tried
and failed to compete with Yahoo. Realizing that e-mail was the
oxygen of the Internet, Hayden formed Critical Path to provide
corporations with one-stop communications packages.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the company went public two years later, it was
servicing 1.4 million mailboxes. With an estimated 245 million
mailboxes on the Internet and the number rising rapidly, the company
seemed poised for tremendous growth.</TE>
<TE>   The analysts and the media certainly thought so. Gartner Group, a
much-quoted consulting firm, estimated that two-thirds of all
companies soon would be outsourcing their e-mail to firms such as
Critical Path. Forbes magazine put Hayden on its cover as one of a
dozen "digital visionaries." Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst Dan Rimer said
the only way Critical Path could be in trouble was "if people
suddenly decide to go back to using fountain pens."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, however, Critical Path's growth from the beginning was
artificial. It acquired rights to service many of those 1.4 million
mailboxes by giving equity stakes to their owners; for example,
online broker E-Trade Group Inc. and phone company US West Inc.
received 21% of the company.</TE>
<TE>   This was a perfectly legal gambit used by many Silicon Valley
start-ups, but there was only so much of the company that could be
traded away. Critical Path had to find new ways to grow quickly, one
reason it went public as soon as it could. It needed to raise money
to buy other companies that immediately would boost its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path's initial public offering took place March 29, 1999,
at a moment when Internet stocks were at their most glamorous.
Investors ignored the fact that the company had revenue of only
$897,000 in the previous year. Barbra Streisand asked for--and
got--so-called friends and family shares, which enabled her to buy in
at the offering price of $24.</TE>
<TE>   It was a good deal: The stock rose 174% the first day, giving the
company a valuation of $2.5 billion. At the IPO party, three
employees were so giddy that they streaked. Maybe it was the four
bottles of Dom Perignon sent by Streisand.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few weeks, the stock jumped to $135. The gap between
reality and expectations had become a chasm. At $135, the stock was
factoring in expectations that Critical Path would service, and make
at least a small profit from, every e-mail box on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Employees, whose number would swell from 182 at the time of the
public offering to 1,042 at the end of 2000, naturally were thrilled
to be working at a hot company. Many programmed their computers to
constantly display the stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Employees knew they suddenly were rich--Hayden's stake alone was
worth more than $300million--but there were constant reminders about
how fragile it all was. In May 1999, when a computer failure
temporarily shut down many Critical Path mailboxes, the stock
immediately dropped 7%.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the stock was offered to the public, the board of
directors had kicked Hayden upstairs. This followed another venerable
tradition in Silicon Valley, where it's the founder's job to launch
the company, not run it. Hayden used a little of his Critical Path
wealth to buy, with television producer Norman Lear, one of the four
surviving privately owned copies of the Declaration of Independence.
The price: $8.1 million.</TE>
<TE>   The task of turning Critical Path from a raw start-up into a truly
successful company that would match its valuation fell to CEO Doug
Hickey and to Thatcher, chief financial officer and, as of January
2000, president. Both were in their mid-40s, with sober
backgrounds--Thatcher a former auditor for accounting firms Touche
Ross and Price Waterhouse, Hickey a veteran tech executive--that
would be reassuring to Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly started to seem like a real company, one former
employee recalled. "Critical Path was started by a bunch of
raver-hippie-engineer types, and they tended to hire their friends,"
said Mike Wertheim, a programmer. "Hickey was slick. He turned the
company corporate. But people figured that was just what had to be
done."</TE>
<TE>   Hickey and Thatcher went on a spending binge, acquiring 10
companies from May 1999 to September 2000. Most of these companies
had few real assets; in fact, four had liabilities that exceeded
their assets. At best, they were developing exciting technology that
might work out well. That was enough to make them hot properties:
Critical Path paid a total of $1.8 billion for them, nearly all in
stock.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisitions, along with other efforts, boosted the number of
mailboxes the company serviced to 6.7 million in fall 1999 and then
to 55 million early in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we are naive or what it is, but I've got to tell
you, we really think we can touch virtually every Internet user in
the world," Hickey told one Internet news site.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes ASAP magazine voted Critical Path its No. 1 "ramp champ,"
saying that out of 100 fast-growing tech companies, it had the
highest score in management, market opportunity, finances and
competitive position. This was not, the magazine said, one of those
companies "that are growing so fast that they spin out of control and
crash."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the pace was frantic. Thatcher told Forbes ASAP he had
worked all night half a dozen times in the previous six months and
logged 30,000 frequent-flier miles in one 15-day span. Employees were
on call 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   The goal, one former employee recalled, was to do whatever was
necessary to make the company look good. That would keep the stock
price up.</TE>
<TE>   "Financial statements usually tell you how successful a company's
product is, but we wanted ours to look like advertising for the
stock," said former Director of Engineering Steve Simitzis. "You
would multiply your stock options by the day's stock price and just
want the company to make its numbers to satisfy the market. You just
wanted your net worth to continue to exist."</TE>
<TE>   Those net worths could be considerable, as outlined in the
company's 2001 proxy. Thatcher, who was paid $500,000 in 2000, made
$5 million off his options. That was only a small part of his
holdings: He had half a million additional shares in vested and
unvested options. Sales chief William Rinehart was paid $210,000 and
cashed in 200,000 options--every one that he could--for stock that
was worth $10 million. An additional 200,000 options were scheduled
to vest over the next several years. Chief Executive Hickey, who was
paid $600,000 in 2000, had vested and unvested options for 1.2
million shares.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the size of any prospective windfall would depend on
the stock price. And Wall Street by this point was beginning to want
more than just growth. It wanted Internet companies to be profitable
too. At a March 2000 investors' conference, Hickey promised both.
"We'll achieve fourth-quarter profitability and at the same time
achieve explosive revenue growth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But as 2000 wore on and the tech sector peaked, the canyon between
the hype and the reality finally became unbridgeable. Those 10
acquisitions initially may have added to the bottom line--1999
revenue was up 1,700%, to $16.2million, and 2000 was expected to
easily clear the $100-million mark--but the new units proved hard to
integrate. The mergers swelled the number of products the company
offered, many of which had little to do with the one thing it really
understood: e-mail management. The company eventually would have 77
facilities on several continents, becoming much too far-flung for its
size.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear, and won't be until federal prosecutors have
finished their investigations, exactly who might face prosecution at
Critical Path besides Thatcher. Twenty-two people were dismissed by
the company after it made its own internal investigation, but
prosecutors aren't likely to pursue anyone below the executive level,
a source said.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Ganley, former vice president of strategic sales, pleaded
guilty last month to selling $31,885 worth of stock based on inside
information about the fraud. Thatcher, meanwhile, is pledging
cooperation and alleging conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for CEO Hickey, who resigned early last year in the
wake of the fraud revelations, said his client "did absolutely
nothing wrong." Hickey relied on Thatcher to give him honest
information, said Richard Marmaro of law firm Proskauer Rose, adding,
"It's not the chief executive's job to go to the customer to confirm
that revenue is real."</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Rinehart, the former sales vice president, didn't
return calls. Rinehart was fired when the fraud was discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Hayden, the founder, "has not been the subject of any criminal or
SEC investigation," the company said.</TE>
<TE>   If the "who" beyond Thatcher awaits the filing of new charges, the
"how" and the "why" are more obvious. Software accounting is complex
and vague, which makes it highly susceptible to abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "A grocery store either sells $1,000 worth of groceries or it
doesn't. At technology companies, it's not so simple," said Dennis
Beresford, former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board.</TE>
<TE>   For one thing, software is small, lightweight and virtually
cost-free to reproduce. It's often bundled with service contracts
that last for several years, which brings up questions about whether
the revenue should be recognized now or later. All those things make
it easy to distort or fake sales in a way that would be impossible
with bread or automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Several experts said high-tech accounting fraud almost always
begins the same way: slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "No one comes in to work and says, 'We're going to do a big fraud
starting right now.' It's a continuum," said Charles Mulford,
professor of accounting at Georgia Tech and author of "The Financial
Numbers Game: Detecting Creative Accounting Practices."</TE>
<TE>   "What they think is, 'We'll do this right now, but I just know
there's that big order down the road, and we'll make good on it.'"</TE>
<TE>   During the second half of 2000, as detailed in court filings,
Critical Path used just about every trick it could to improperly and
illegally boost its revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The first gimmick was a software swap, sometimes called a Barney
deal in tribute to the purple dinosaur who proclaims, "I love you,
you love me." Under accounting rules, the goods on both sides of the
swap must be valued at fair-market prices.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path's swap was with Peregrine Systems Inc., a San Diego
company at which Thatcher had once worked.</TE>
<TE>   "To avoid the appearance that the transaction was a software swap,
Critical Path and Peregrine prepared separate contracts for each
purchase, each paid the full amounts owed, and made payments to each
other on different days," Thatcher admitted in his plea agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Thatcher admits that Critical Path didn't actually want what it
was buying from Peregrine. The deal, he told the judge, "was driven
by the need to report revenue"--$3million worth.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine, based in San Diego, maintains that there were two
separate transactions and that its accounting was appropriate. (The
company said Wednesday that it was delaying reporting fiscal-year
results "pending continued audit activities." Its shares dropped 50%
to $3.45.)</TE>
<TE>   A second deal was done with International Computers Ltd. ICL said
it was owed $8.7 million by PeerLogic, one of Critical Path's many
acquisitions, but was willing to settle the claim for $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Critical Path paid the full $8.7 million, and ICL paid
back $2.7 million to Critical Path for software, according to
Thatcher's plea agreement. Essentially, Critical Path paid ICL to buy
its software--not only a gross violation of accounting rules but a
crazy way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   ICL, a London division of Fujitsu Ltd., didn't respond to e-mails
about the deal.</TE>
<TE>   These and other improper deals added $9.7 million in revenue to
Critical Path's third-quarter total, bringing it to $45 million. Wall
Street, which had been expecting only $39 million, immediately sent
the stock up $5 a share. Hickey used the occasion to raise
fourth-quarter revenue estimates from about $50 million to $54
million to $56 million.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, on Nov. 2, Critical Path held a meeting for 100
investors and analysts. The company, Hickey said, was about to join
"an elite group of profitable 'new-economy' companies."</TE>
<TE>   The Wholesale</TE>
<TE>   Deception Begins</TE>
<TE>   But if it was all smiles and sunlight outside, in the management
suite there was gloom and recklessness. As the dot-coms began to
fade, Critical Path lost about three-quarters of its value in the
first 11 months of 2000. The easiest accounting tricks had been used
in the third quarter. Now the wholesale deception began.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path sent $2.1 million in software to Storerunner
Network, a struggling San Diego shopping site, despite the fact that
Thatcher knew the chances of getting paid were essentially
nonexistent. But he booked the shipment as revenue anyway.
Storerunner filed for bankruptcy protection two months later.</TE>
<TE>   Another customer was Education Networks of America, a Web resource
for teachers that was interested in Critical Path's software and
services but wasn't sure it could afford them. So Critical Path
issued a side letter that gave ENA the ability to back out of the
$2.2-million deal, according to Thatcher's plea agreement. Critical
Path booked the revenue, even though ENA exercised its option to
cancel.</TE>
<TE>   Finally came the $2-million deal with Bestseats.com, the ticket
broker. When the Critical Path finance department, unaware of the
fraud, asked the broker for proof he could pay for his $2-million
purchase, he responded with an e-mail saying his firm had only
$250,000 in capital. Before the finance department could see it,
Thatcher changed the number to $12.5 million. Bestseats, which is
based in the East Bay, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Even with nearly $10 million in sham revenue, Critical Path
couldn't make its fourth-quarter sales goals, much less a profit.
Total sales for the quarter were $52million, $2million shy of its low
estimate. Instead of the promised profit, there was a net loss of
$11.5million. Analysts were upset, and the stock immediately lost
half its value.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, on Feb. 2, 2001, the company said it had
"discovered a number of transactions" that were improper.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were livid. Bert Hochfeld of Josephthal &amp; Co. said he
felt as if he had been raped. The stock fell 70% more, to $3.
Lawsuits were filed. The company restated its revenue. The stock slid
all year, bottoming out at 24 cents in September.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC's chief accountant, Charles Niemeier, warned in February
that even if a company strictly followed accounting rules, it still
could face fraud charges if its filings distorted the company's true
condition.</TE>
<TE>   By that standard, a great number of tech companies might have
reason to be worried.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much greed and so many get-rich-quick schemes," said
Ram Shriram, a Silicon Valley financier and an early investor in
Critical Path. "People did not take a long-term view of building
businesses. Some not only cut corners but ran afoul of ethics and the
law."</TE>
<TE>   Painfully Becoming</TE>
<TE>   a Real Company</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path says it finally has that long-term view. Hayden
reassumed control after the fraud came to light; he and McGlashan,
the new CEO, closed two-thirds of those 77 offices, cut the number of
products and employees in half, settled the shareholder lawsuits and
convinced most of the board that it was time to move on. Of the $1.8
billion paid for acquisitions, $1.3 billion was written off.</TE>
<TE>   The Critical Path of two years ago wasn't a real company,
McGlashan said in an interview in the company's new and cheaper
offices next to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. "There was no
cash management, no budget. Nothing was ever integrated. Basic 101
stuff seemed to be missing."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, according to the company's 2001 proxy, there were a lot
of sweetheart deals for executives. A plane was leased from an
aviation company that Thatcher and Hickey had invested in. Bonuses
could approach or even exceed salaries, despite the fact that the
company lost $79million in 2000. The company lent CFO Larry Reinhold
$1.7million after he was hired in December 2000. One clause in the
loan said he wouldn't have to pay either interest or principal if he
quit. Saying he had accomplished "a great deal," Reinhold quit last
August.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path would be a much harder place to commit fraud now. To
take just one example, salespeople no longer approve contracts. The
legal and finance departments do.</TE>
<TE>   All the old management except for Hayden, who remains as executive
chairman, and the chief technical officer are gone.</TE>
<TE>   McGlashan doesn't miss them.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a corporate culture based on people thinking they're going
to be rich," he said. "The temptation, when billions and billions are
involved, becomes extraordinary."</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path isn't very tempting anymore. Though the stock has
recovered to about $2, only one analyst, Larry Berlin of First
Analysis, still is tracking it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a viable company with a good product that has potential,"
Berlin said. "But it's not going to be a get-rich-quick scheme for
anyone."</TE>

<HD>Brain Probes Give Rats Their Marching Orders</HD>
<DH>Science: Implants can direct behavior. 'Implications are
scary,' an expert says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Transmitting wireless signals directly into the brain, a group of
scientists has produced the ultimate lab rat--an animal that can be
guided by remote control over fences, up trees, through pipe and
across rubble at distances up to a third of a mile.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers, from the State University of New York and Drexel
University, say their work with brain implants ultimately could
produce "robotic" rats that could be used for rescue missions, video
surveillance or detecting explosives.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers implanted electrical probes in critical centers of
the brain that affect what an animal senses and how it behaves. They
then trained the animals to respond to impulses sent through the
implants. Once trained, the animals could be readily controlled by an
operator with a laptop computer transmitting to a small backpack
receiver worn by each rat.</LD>
<TE>   "We developed a way to create seemingly complex behaviors in
animals by generating cues and rewards," said lead researcher Sanjiv
Talwar at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. "The rats
could almost understand what you wanted them to do."</TE>
<TE>   The work, published today in the journal Nature, is pretty
amazing, say researchers who work in the field of mind-machine
interactions. But, scientists acknowledge, many people may find such
remote brain control disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   The drive behind the research is a humanitarian one--finding
better ways to build artificial limbs and other prosthetics that
could communicate fully with nerves. Nonetheless, "You would want to
be careful how far you took this kind of research," said Caltech
neural expert Richard Andersen. "The implications are a little
scary."</TE>
<TE>   The brain stimulation technique used to condition the laboratory
rats could almost certainly work in other species, including humans,
said Paul W. Glimcher, an expert at New York University on the
neurobiology of decision-making.</TE>
<TE>   "That is what is so disturbing about it," Glimcher said. "It is
clearly a technique that if applied to humans would have huge legal,
moral and ethical ramifications. That raises real questions about
whether a technology of this type could be used to undermine the
autonomy of an individual decision-maker."</TE>
<TE>   Previously, scientists had only been listening to the electrical
signals generated by brain cells. They are able to decipher the
brain's output and use it to activate machines.</TE>
<TE>   Several laboratories have used brain cell activity from rats and
monkeys to control robotic arms, even when the device--connected
through the Internet--is hundreds of miles away. Only last month
researchers at Brown University successfully wired a monkey to a
computer so its mental activity could move a cursor.</TE>
<TE>   With this latest accomplishment, scientists are talking back
directly to brain cells.</TE>
<TE>   To perform the experiment, the scientists injected signals
directly into sensory and learning areas of the brain. They want to
learn how to create the feedback of touch and other sensations
normally provided by a living limb.</TE>
<TE>   "We are bringing information back into the brain," said John
Chapin, a professor of physiology and pharmacology at the Downstate
Medical Center, who was a senior researcher on the project.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the scientists successfully wired five rats in a project
funded by the Department of Defense.</TE>
<TE>   Each animal had three sets of hair-thin wires implanted in its
brain. One wire went to a part of the forebrain that generates a
sensation as a reward to reinforce behavior. The other electrodes
went to regions responsible for the rat's whiskers, which it uses to
navigate.</TE>
<TE>   The electrodes, in turn, were connected to a wireless transmitter
in a lightweight backpack powered by a 9-volt battery. The rat's
backpack also contained a tiny video camera. The researchers are
considering adding other sensors, such as a global positioning system
unit to better track the rat as it moves.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists steered the rats by activating the whisker centers,
creating the sensation of a touch on one side or the other. Sending
signals to the brain's reward center reinforced correct behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "In some real sense, they have produced a computer bridle," said
Glimcher. "Instead of a whip and carrot, they use direct activation
of the learning circuit in the brain itself, which is pretty cool."</TE>
<TE>   The rodents could even be commanded to overcome their natural
caution and venture into brightly lit, open areas--environments they
normally would avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are showing that there is a way to deliver the signal
to the brain directly and apparently the signal can be interpreted.
This is a very important result," said Miguel Nicolelis at Duke
University, who also works on brain-machine interfaces.</TE>
<TE>   It may be most important as a harbinger of things to come, as
brain researchers become more adept at manipulating the organ
responsible for thought and behavior, several experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Long before we get to the real ethical problems posed by changing
our genes, we will have to deal with the consequences of the
revolution in neuroscience," said Arthur Caplan, director of the
University of Pennsylvania Bioethics Center.</TE>
<TE>   "This rat research is primitive stuff, but it is a shot across our
bow that should alert us to the potential consequences."</TE>

<HD>Slave Owners and Their Insurers Are Named</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Department of Insurance on Wednesday identified half a
dozen insurance companies that issued slavery-era policies and posted
the names of hundreds of slave owners and the slaves they insured on
the agency's Web site.</LD>
<LD>   For advocates of paying reparations to the descendants of slaves,
the report provides a compendium of material that could advance their
efforts by identifying companies that profited from slavery. At a
minimum, the records unearth long-forgotten names of those who
trafficked in slaves and detail the crass financial arrangements that
undergirded the nation's long embrace of trade in humans.</LD>
<LD>   "These types of exercises give us a history lesson, and what the
reparations movement is trying to do is concretely link the present
and past by showing the lingering economic effects," said Darnell
Hunt, director of African American Studies at UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   The report, posted at www. insurance.ca.gov, attracted more than
8,000 hits in the first three hours after it was released.</TE>
<TE>   None of the firms named Wednesday are based in California. But a
state law pushed by then-Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) and signed
into law by Gov. Gray Davis in 2000 requires all insurance companies
doing business in California to publicly release information about
policies they or their predecessor firms wrote insuring slave owners
for losses if slaves died or ran away.</TE>
<TE>   No other state has required insurance companies to compile and
release such information.</TE>
<TE>   The report includes 60 pages of charts listing more than 600
slaves by name and more than 400 slave owners. The listings are
sketchy--slaves often are listed only by first name--but tantalizing,
offering clues into the lives of slaves and their owners.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, a man named Stephen Chenoweth of Louisville, Ky.,
took out insurance policies on five slaves named Tillman, George,
Jack, Bob and John Owen. The policies, written by the predecessor of
New York Life Insurance Co., say the slaves were to be employed as
firemen, cooks or cabin boys on riverboats between Louisville and New
Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Kentucky Historical Society, the Chenoweths,
originally from Virginia, were among the first settlers in
Louisville. They established a fort called Chenoweth Station, and
become targets of the last major raid on white settlers by Indians in
1789.</TE>
<TE>   The Chenoweth clan became well-established and well-connected,
said Ron Bryant of the historical society, which has a 600-page tome
on the family. Bryant said records show that a Stephen Ross Chenoweth
was listed in the 1850 Census as having a net worth of $20,000, a
considerable sum at the time, and an 1848 Louisville directory listed
his occupation as "jailer."</TE>
<TE>   "It means 'slave jailer;' he bought and sold slaves," Bryant said.</TE>
<TE>   William Werfelman, spokesman for New York Life, said the
California law prompted the company to search its archives, finding
that its predecessor company, Nautilus Insurance, wrote policies for
slave owners for two years, in 1846-47, then discontinued the
practice when the firm trustees voted to end the practice.</TE>
<TE>   "New York Life abhors the practice of slavery, historically and
currently, and we profoundly regret that our predecessor company,
Nautilus, was associated in any way with it, for even a brief period
of time," Werfelman said. "The fact that slavery was legal in certain
parts of the United States at the time doesn't make it any less
repugnant."</TE>
<TE>   New York Life provided a list of 484 names of slaves and 233
slaveholders. The company reported that the policies generally were
written for less than $500 and were for one-year terms. New York Life
turned its records over to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black
Culture, a part of the New York Public Library.</TE>
<TE>   At the Schomburg Center, director Howard Dodson characterized the
report as "a piece of evidence." It is limited to insurance companies
doing business in California currently, and does not include other
industries that profited from slavery.</TE>
<TE>   "I anticipated there would be a larger number of policies," Dodson
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew that New York Life was in the business Some of the others
were in much longer period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Other firms named include Aetna, AIG, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance,
Manhattan Life and Ace USA. Two other firms, Penn Mutual and
Providence Washington, provided documents but nothing showing they
had issued policies on slaves.</TE>
<TE>   AIG produced a magazine article describing a $550 policy on a
slave named Charles.</TE>
<TE>   Among the policy's exclusions: "death to said slave by means of
any invasion, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, or of any military
or usurped power, or in case the slave shall die by his own hand or
in consequence of a duel or by the hands of justice."</TE>
<TE>   Another firm, Ace USA, found only a single policy on a slave
identified only as a laborer named Peter in Mississippi. Ace reported
that as part of its research to comply with the law, it obtained a
database of 27,233 transatlantic slave ship voyages from 1595 to
1866.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, companies that issued policies for
transatlantic shipping firms are not represented in the report,
perhaps because they are out of business, or have no business in
California, insurance department spokeswoman Nanci Kramer said.</TE>
<TE>   One exception involved a marine insurance policy issued by
Manhattan Life, and that policy did not cover shipping in the
African-American trade.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, Manhattan Life insured 720 Chinese slaves, called
"coolies," aboard the vessel Sea Witch, bound for Panama. The company
covered one-fourth of the $84,000 insured value of the human cargo.</TE>
<TE>   When three of the workers jumped ship and 11 others died on the
voyage, Manhattan Life paid the owners $408, leaving the insurance
company with a profit of $432.</TE>
<TE>   Hunt said the material released Wednesday represented an
incremental but important step in recasting the national discussion
of race and slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Targeting insurance companies helps reveal the "naked
calculation," Hunt added. It paints a picture of slaves as chattel
insured like valuable jewelry, cars or homes.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimate value of the information will only be known over
time, said Douglas H. Daniels, professor of black studies and history
at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The report, Slavery Era Insurance Policies Registry, makes no
comment on the politically controversial issue of reparations.
Indeed, it never uses the word. Neither Davis nor his appointee,
Insurance Commissioner Harry Low, commented on the report's contents.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who signed the Hayden bill into law in 2000, had planned to
hold a news conference Wednesday in Los Angeles but canceled it.
Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said the governor "hasn't taken
a position on reparations."</TE>
<TE>   But in a comment that last week became fodder for Northern
California talk shows, Davis, appearing with the Rev. Jesse L.
Jackson Sr., said: "Clearly, we want to right any wrongs, and do
justice to people who were taken advantage of if that is the case.
And I believe that will be the case."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson on Wednesday hailed California's posting of the report as
a "breakthrough" and praised Hayden for pushing the legislation,
which he said would urge other states to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the key that opens the door to insurance companies and
banks involved in the slave trade," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bill Simon Jr., Davis' Republican challenger in the race for
governor, issued a statement criticizing the Democratic governor's
"divisive and politically motivated support for reparations."</TE>
<TE>   "Bringing up the wounds of our country's past in a politically
motivated attempt to shore up his political standing today is typical
of Gov. Davis, who offers only politics, and no solutions," Simon's
statement said.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans feel pain for what happened over 150 years ago, but we
cannot right the wrongs of history by handing out money generations
later."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Lisa Richardson contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Mandatory Sentencing Backlash Builds</HD>
<DH>Courts: A life term given to a minor drug offender in
Alabama is one case cited by critics of the laws, which face judicial
review and rollbacks in several states.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Theresa Wilson--a first-time, nonviolent drug offender--tried to sell
a prescription medication to an undercover police officer for $150
back in 1998. She was tried as a "drug baron" under this state's
strict narcotics laws, and sentenced to life in prison.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the 34-year-old mother of two got perhaps the first
break of her life. She was freed.</LD>
<LD>   "You've gotten a second chance," said Jefferson County Circuit
Judge Tommy Nail. "Don't blow it."</LD>
<TE>   To many, Wilson had become a symbol of the high price of mandatory
sentencing. And her release is the latest in a series of events
challenging those laws.</TE>
<TE>   Intended to target drug kingpins, many mandatory minimum laws, as
they're known, more often have sent addicts, drug dealers'
girlfriends and college kids peddling marijuana to prison for long
terms.</TE>
<TE>   Now the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear two cases, probably
in the fall, challenging California's three-strikes law, the toughest
of its kind in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), a former federal prosecutor, and
Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) are pushing a bill that would ease mandatory
sentences for those who played a minimal role in a drug transaction.
(Neither lawmaker is known for being easy on criminals.)</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana, Michigan, Connecticut, North Dakota, Utah, Washington
state, Iowa and Mississippi also have rolled back at least some of
their mandatory minimum statutes in the last year or two.</TE>
<TE>   They have rolled them back to prevent more cases like Wilson's.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an extreme example, but it just shows that mandatory
sentencing doesn't work," Wilson's attorney, Bill Bowen, said a few
hours after his client went free. "Mandatory sentencing is based on
the premise that people all came from the same cookie-cutter, and
they didn't."</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Wilson--a junior high school dropout--was losing all
control, she said in the only interview since her incarceration, in
the Birmingham News this week.</TE>
<TE>   The product of a troubled household, she drank too much, had
become addicted to prescription painkillers after a medical problem,
was deeply in debt and had marital problems. Then her mother died,
she said. Then the state took custody of her two children.</TE>
<TE>   Unable to pay a $95 electricity bill, she got a vial of a
prescription morphine solution from a neighbor whose late husband had
used the painkiller while undergoing cancer treatments.</TE>
<TE>   During a secretly taped conversation with an undercover police
officer posing as a drug buyer, Wilson said she had no idea what the
morphine was worth. So she offered to sell it for $150. She would
keep $80 for herself, she said, and give $70 to the neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   The police officer replied that he only had $80 with him. No
problem, Wilson said on the tape; he could pay her whenever he had
the money.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson had no idea that the 97.8 grams of morphine solution had a
street value of $10,000--or that the confluence of circumstances
would land her desperate crime under a law intended to nab Alabama's
biggest drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems with mandatory sentencing laws is that the
low-level offenders are the most likely to be targeted," said Monica
Pratt of the Washington-based Families Against Mandatory Minimums.
"Cooperation is often the only way to reduce your sentence, and since
low-level offenders and addicts have no information to trade, they
have nothing to offer prosecutors."</TE>
<TE>   As she awaited trial, Wilson reunited with her husband--who is now
a minister--regained custody of her children and got a job as a
church secretary.</TE>
<TE>   In March 1998, Circuit Judge J. Richmond Pearson was visibly
shaken when, saying he had no choice, he sentenced Wilson to spend
the rest of her life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Wilson appealed. In August the state appellate court's
opinion came down.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's sentence, wrote Judge Sue Bell Cobb, was "grossly
disproportionate."</TE>
<TE>   The Alabama attorney general then appealed the case to the state
Supreme Court. In April, the court agreed with the lower court's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Wilson was transported from Julia Tutwiler Prison in
Wetumpka to the Jefferson County Jail to await Wednesday's hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In the courtroom, Nail allowed her to hug her husband and teenage
children. Then he set her free.</TE>
<TE>   A crying Wilson went back to the jail, signed her release papers,
and headed for a welcome-home supper at her church.</TE>

<DH>Crime: With longtime rivalries renewed, biker gangs have
launched aggressive recruiting drives. Recent violence underscores
the trend.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Law enforcement officials call Saturday's fatal biker brawl in the
Nevada resort town of Laughlin a symptom of a quiet but dangerous
trend nationwide: Low profile for years, motorcycle gangs are growing
again. And they are becoming more violent.</LD>
<LD>   Renewed rivalries have prompted legendary outlaw groups such as
the Hells Angels to launch recruiting drives, often absorbing smaller
clubs wholesale in an effort to increase their strength, officials
say.</LD>
<LD>   "We've seen a real resurgence in recruiting by biker gangs. And as
they grow, so do their problems," said Lt. Terry Katz, a Maryland
State Police officer who has studied biker gangs for more than 25
years.</LD>
<TE>   "The attitude is, 'I'm bigger than you are, so I should get more
respect,'" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the overwhelming majority of motorcycle clubs are
made up of harmless enthusiasts. But up to 600 outlaw biker gangs are
also active across the country, investigators estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Among the largest on the East Coast are the Pagans and the
Outlaws. The Bandidos, based in Texas, is considered the nation's
largest biker group with more than 2,500 members.</TE>
<TE>   In California the largest groups are the Mongols and the infamous
Hells Angels, which claims about 1,500 members worldwide. That
membership is up dramatically from just a few hundred members a
decade ago, Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Outlaw motorcycle gangs emerged in the late 1950s. Their fearsome
reputations, however, began to fade by the 1990s as many gangs
accepted peace deals brokered by leaders such as the Hells Angels'
George Christie of Ventura. But those agreements have faltered for
reasons that are unclear, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Some recent examples of violence include a February brawl that
left one man dead and 10 wounded at a Hells Angels convention in Long
Island. A Philadelphia tattoo parlor belonging to a Pagans leader was
firebombed in March during a melee between the Pagans and Hells
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The latest chapter came Saturday night, when an argument exploded
between several Hells Angels and Mongols members at the annual
Laughlin River Run for bikers. Captured on surveillance cameras at
Harrah's Casino &amp; Hotel about 2:15 a.m., the fight left three dead
and at least 12 hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed tensions are driving demand for new members, as biker
gangs try to prove that they are the strongest by being the biggest,
said a Riverside Police Department detective who specializes in
motorcycle gang investigations.</TE>
<TE>   "They need members to compete with each other," said the officer,
who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve his safety.</TE>
<TE>   "George Christie has even started taking in 18- to 21-year-olds,
which used to be verboten. But he took a bunch of white street gang
members and turned them into Hells Angels."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officers said the newest trend is right out of the
Italian mobster handbook, with many of the large biker gangs adopting
smaller crews to do their dirty work. Once the smaller crews prove
their loyalty, they are "patched in," meaning they can proudly claim
themselves as Mongols, Outlaws or Hells Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like becoming a made member of the Mafia," Katz said. "Being
patched in is a compliment. You're one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Such tactics used to be fiercely rejected by the tougher biker
groups because they considered other biker gangs beneath them,
authorities said. But a need for rapid expansion in light of the
renewed rivalries has changed that attitude, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The prospective biker gang members are expected to prove
themselves by committing any number of crimes: drug smuggling, auto
theft, arson, assault and even murder.</TE>
<TE>   Their crimes in recent years have grown well beyond smuggling
methamphetamines, for decades the biker drug of choice. With much of
that market taken over by smugglers from Mexico, outlaw biker groups
have taken to selling cocaine, auto theft and prostitution rings,
investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   These facts run contrary to an image long promoted by outlaw biker
gangs. As police focused on inner-city gang violence in the 1980s,
the biker groups crafted an image as middle-class, middle-aged
enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   Biker gangs worked hard to stay out of the public eye. And when
they did emerge, it was often only long enough to pass out teddy
bears to sick children or participate in other charity events.</TE>
<TE>   Photographs of Christie running with the Olympic torch in 1984
were even splashed across area newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   Some contend that the kinder, gentler face of bikers presented to
the public in recent years is the true picture of the motorcycle
clubs today.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the Hells Angels are presently eligible for membership in
the AARP," said Robert Sheahen, a Los Angeles attorney who represents
the best-known biker group. "These are good, civic-minded people."</TE>
<TE>   Sheahen represented Christie and several other members of the
Hells Angels organization in a sweeping Ventura County drug case this
year. Prosecutors alleged that Christie led a drug ring that sold
stolen prescription narcotics to teenagers on high school campuses in
Ventura and Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   More than a dozen Hells Angels members, Christie's ex-wife and
their 25-year-old son were indicted. But many of the counts were
ultimately dismissed and Christie was sentenced last month to three
years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   Sheahen pointed to the prosecutor's failure to net prison time for
Christie, despite a five-year, $2-million investigation, as an
example of overzealous investigators chasing nothing more than an
image of what biker gangs used to represent.</TE>
<TE>   "The police and prosecutors' fear of them is irrational," Sheahen
said. "They fear a mystic to the point of prosecutorial lunacy, and
there is nothing to fear."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities, however, are on standby after Saturday's violence in
Laughlin, carefully watching for signs of retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost like after a terrorist strike," said Chip Patterson,
spokesman for the Sheriff's Department in San Bernardino, where a
large Hells Angels clubhouse has operated for decades. "There was a
lot of bloodshed in Laughlin, and we just don't know where and when
it might happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Charles Ornstein contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fire Levels Chemical Plant Near Houston</HD>
<DH>Explosion: No one is hurt in blast at the Pearland
facility, which blended petrochemicals. But 100 people living nearby
are temporarily evacuated.</DH>

<DL>PEARLAND, Texas</DL>
<LD>A series of explosions sparked a fire Wednesday that destroyed a
chemical plant here and forced about 100 people living nearby to
evacuate their homes, officials said. No injuries were reported but
one house was destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   The blaze at Third Coast Packaging sent flames soaring hundreds of
feet into the air.</LD>
<LD>   Residents were awakened when their windows were rattled by the
blasts at the plant, which packages and labels chemicals and includes
a tank farm for storage.</LD>
<TE>   "It was chaos--firetrucks, officers, balls of fire and loud
explosions," said Carlie Bankston, 21, who lives about three houses
down from the plant.</TE>
<TE>   The explosions were heard as far as five miles from the plant and
flames were seen more than 10 miles away, witnesses said. Pearland is
about 20 miles southeast of Houston.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, no flames were visible but the fire still
smoldered under the blackened ruins of the plant where petrochemicals
were blended into products such as antifreeze and motor oil.</TE>
<TE>   The company had more than 90 tanks on site, each holding as much
as 50,000 gallons of petroleum products, company President Tim
Elliott said.</TE>
<TE>   "We had flames 800 feet in the air at the plant," Houston District
Fire Chief Jack Williams said. "At one point, about 15 tanks were on
fire."</TE>
<TE>   He said it would take two to three days for the burning petroleum
products to be extinguished.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said two warehouses and one house were destroyed.
Occupants of the house had been evacuated but firefighters were
unable to save the building.</TE>
<TE>   A check for toxic chemicals showed no such substances were
involved.</TE>

<DL>CLOUDCROFT, N.M.</DL>
<LD>About 800 people fled their homes and at least three structures were
destroyed as a wind-driven wildfire roared through 1,500 acres of the
Lincoln National Forest on Wednesday and threatened the tiny Otero
County town of Mayhill.</LD>
<LD>   Erratic winds--with gusts up to 60 mph--forced firefighters to
pull back from the rapidly growing Penasco Fire and prevented air
tankers from dropping fire-retardant chemicals.</LD>
<LD>   The state's Emergency Operations Center opened Wednesday afternoon
to coordinate fire control efforts.</LD>
<TE>   "We lost it; the weather conditions were totally against us," said
Rick Hartigan, a fire information officer with the U.S. Forest
Service.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, which started Tuesday, was burning in a heavily wooded
area of the Sacramento Mountains. Up to 800 people were evacuated,
said Tom Gorman, a spokesman for the emergency operations center.</TE>
<TE>   David Williams, who lives about 15 miles southwest of Cloudcroft,
said the fire had destroyed his home and a fire official said another
house also had been lost.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew for a fact this was the one I had been expecting for 10
years," Williams said of the fire.</TE>
<TE>   In southern Arizona, fire had charred up to 30,000 acres of dry
grass and oak brush, knocking out power to Ft. Huachuca Army post.</TE>
<TE>   Three Ft. Huachuca schools were closed and all nonemergency
personnel were urged to stay home, said base spokeswoman Tanja
Linton.</TE>
<TE>   The blackout, caused when fire damaged power lines, posed no
danger, she said.</TE>

<HD>Congress Prepares to Support Israel</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: The Bush administration fears that the House and
Senate resolutions, while nonbinding, may hamper peace efforts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congress, venting its pent-up outrage at Mideast violence, moved
suddenly Wednesday toward approval of resolutions expressing support
for Israel, forcing the Bush administration to scramble to prevent
diplomatic damage.</LD>
<LD>   The development came days after the White House had persuaded
House GOP leaders to postpone a vote on a resolution that includes
criticism of the Palestinian leadership stemming from the suicide
bombing campaign against Israeli civilians.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials had argued that congressional action
could hinder efforts to broker peace with the help of Arab states.
But now legislators from both parties say the time has come for
Congress to speak out.</LD>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) announced a vote today
on a resolution "expressing solidarity with Israel in its fight
against terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), in a White House
meeting Wednesday, told President Bush the Senate would soon take
similar action. The Senate resolution, Daschle told reporters,
"simply says what I think America needs to say, and that is: 'We
support Israel.'"</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a pro-Israel stampede the administration apparently
can no longer contain, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said
Bush is understanding of the congressional desire to make a
statement. The president told Daschle he would work with Congress on
the issue, Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleischer cautioned that while the 100 senators and 435 House
members may have opinions on the Mideast, "no foreign policy can
survive 535 different secretaries of State."</TE>
<TE>   Any vote taken in the House or the Senate would be expected to go
overwhelmingly in Israel's favor. For years, Congress has backed the
Jewish state with large amounts of military and economic aid--nearly
$3 billion in the current fiscal year. Periodically, legislators also
have voted for pro-Israel resolutions or signed letters of support
for it.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent congressional vote on the Mideast came late last
year. On Dec. 5, after two deadly bombings in Israel, the House
approved a pro-Israel resolution, 384 to 11.</TE>
<TE>   But while the margins for Israel are expected to be just as high
in the upcoming votes, administration officials were most concerned
about the wording of the resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the latest House resolution, sponsored by Majority
Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) and Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), contained
blunt language. It questioned whether Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is a "viable partner for peace"; condemned the "ongoing
support and coordination of terror" by Arafat and others; and backed
additional U.S. aid to help Israel defend itself.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional aides said Wednesday that they expected the measure
would be modified slightly to assuage the administration's concerns.
One expected change would say the House condemns Arafat for
"tolerating" rather than coordinating terror. Another probable change
would drop the reference to additional funding for Israel. More aid,
however, could be forthcoming as early as this month.</TE>
<TE>   The White House gave tacit assent to a House vote Wednesday, a GOP
leadership aide said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate resolution appears to be more to the administration's
liking. Sponsored by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Gordon
Smith (R-Ore.), the resolution is milder than the House version and
does not mention Arafat by name.</TE>
<TE>   It does, however, declare that the United States "stands in
solidarity with Israel, a front line state in the war against
terrorism, as it takes necessary steps to provide security to its
people by dismantling the terrorist infrastructure in the Palestinian
areas."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate version also condemns Palestinian suicide bombings and
declares that the United States will continue to help Israel defend
itself.</TE>
<TE>   On one level, the resolutions do not pose a major obstacle for
Bush's foreign policy. They are legally nonbinding, and language in
them quotes Bush and praises his diplomacy. But presidents rarely are
eager for Congress to step directly into foreign affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The resolutions also have a domestic political dimension.
Republican and Democratic legislators have their eyes on an important
constituency in an election year: an aroused Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, House Minority Whip Nancy Pelosi (D-San
Francisco) accused DeLay of seeking to drive a wedge between
Democrats and Jewish voters by promoting his strongly worded
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   While Pelosi acknowledged that she would probably support his
resolution, she noted that the action would be closely followed by a
Jewish community that has tended to vote Democratic.</TE>
<TE>   "The point is, [DeLay] wants to woo away some of those voters from
the Democrats to Republicans," Pelosi told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the Capitol has been a stage for large rallies by
Palestinian sympathizers and supporters of Israel. Jewish American
and Arab American groups also have pressed their views on
legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista) said he has been besieged by
activists seeking to air their Mideast grievances.</TE>
<TE>   "Lobby groups certainly are turning up the pressure--every Arab
and every pro-Israel group," Issa said.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't possibly meet with them all. It is becoming very
intense."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Janet Hook and Edwin Chen contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Bush to Fight Porn Ruling</HD>
<DH>Law: Ashcroft and legislators, angry about a Supreme Court
decision allowing computer- generated images of children, want to ban
them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration and congressional leaders, squaring off
angrily against the Supreme Court over what constitutes child
pornography, sought Wednesday to create a new standard that would ban
as obscene any sexual imagery involving pre-pubescent children.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government has never sought to distinguish between
younger and older children in attacking child pornography, officials
said, and the new definition could give lawmakers a way to circumvent
a Supreme Court decision last month concerning the issue. It would
outlaw the peddling of sexual imagery--even the "virtual,"
computer-generated variety--if it includes children who have not
reached puberty.</LD>
<LD>   The high court ruled April 16 that Congress went too far in a 1996
anti-child pornography bill by outlawing imagery of computer-created
children engaged in sex, as well as films and photos depicting adult
actors who appear to be children. The court, in striking down part of
the law, said such images are protected by the 1st Amendment.</LD>
<TE>   A bipartisan group of lawmakers, joined by Atty. Gen. John
Ashcroft, proposed a new version Wednesday of the anti-child
pornography measure that seeks to put modified restrictions in place
while staying within the limits set by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, backers of the bill--including Republicans often
in harmony with the conservative-leaning high court--unleashed an
unusually fierce attack accusing the justices of aiding child
pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Ashcroft at a news conference, Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.)
said the Supreme Court is "siding with pedophiles over children."
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) said the ruling was "a huge
disappointment to everyone working to protect children."</TE>
<TE>   The debate pits the Bush administration against the judiciary
branch once again on an emotional issue in which Ashcroft is seeking
to claim the moral high ground. Two weeks ago, the issue was assisted
suicide, as a federal judge in Oregon ruled that Ashcroft had
overstepped his authority in attempting to sanction doctors there who
prescribe lethal drugs under the state's landmark assisted-suicide
law. The administration is threatening to appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Ashcroft, then a Missouri senator, was a key backer of
the Child Pornography Prevention Act, and he and other Justice
Department officials maintain that the Supreme Court's ruling already
is making it more difficult to pursue cases of sexual abuse against
minors involved in pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said the Supreme Court's ruling comes at a time when
child pornography "is exploding on the Internet." A recent federal
crackdown uncovered more than 7,200 alleged child pornographers
offering sexual images on a single Internet group. That case involved
48 children who allegedly were molested, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation proposed Wednesday allows criminal charges against
anyone who knowingly possesses "a visual depiction that is, or is
virtually indistinguishable from, that of a pre-pubescent child
engaging in sexually explicit conduct."</TE>
<TE>   This bill would narrow a ban in the 1996 law on virtual
pornography involving all minors, regardless of how young they were.</TE>
<TE>   The new legislation defines "pre-pubescent" as any child who "does
not exhibit significant pubescent physical or sexual maturation." The
bill does not give an age range, but Justice Department officials
said they generally considered it to be under the age of 12.</TE>
<TE>   The pre-pubescent ban seeks to exploit an exemption in last
month's Supreme Court ruling for truly obscene works, which the court
said can be prosecuted as a crime because obscenity is outside the
protections of the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials said the new focus on pre-pubescent
children avoids the constitutional pitfalls of the earlier
legislation because they considered any sexual imagery involving
younger children to be "per se obscene."</TE>
<TE>   But free speech advocates and adult entertainment industry
officials said they would likely challenge this concept because it
would significantly expand the Supreme Court's 1973 definition of
obscenity as a work that is sexually graphic, "patently offensive,"
and lacking any other redeeming value.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no such thing as 'per se obscenity,' until a court
defines something as obscene," said Marvin Johnson, legislative
counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "This bill still looks like it's trying to outlaw virtual child
pornography, and I'm not sure this is going to pass legal muster,
since the court has already ruled on that issue," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that, under the new definition, information or images
involving a young child in a psychology manual about sexual abuse
could be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Douglas, chairman of the Free Speech Coalition Inc., an
adult-industry trade association that brought last month's Supreme
Court case, said a depiction of Russian novelist Feodor Dostoevski's
"The Possessed," featuring the suicide of a man who was molested as a
child, also could be banned.</TE>

<HD>Revised Smog Rules Leave Ships on Cruise Control</HD>
<DH>Pollution: EPA regulations proposed this week do not
exceed international standards set five years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Smog-forming emissions from oceangoing ships will remain virtually
unchanged under a new regulation the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency announced on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The federal Clean Air Act requires the EPA to approve pollution
controls for new cargo carriers, tankers and cruise liners, but
environmentalists contended that the agency failed to take action on
the biggest vessels and sued. A settlement was reached in the fall of
2000 but it did not specify what the measure should be.</LD>
<LD>   The regulation EPA Administrator Christie Whitman proposed this
week does not require emissions reductions beyond those set five
years ago under an international accord. Those limits have been
widely criticized as unduly lenient. New ships already comply.</LD>
<TE>   About 30,000 ships are in service worldwide, producing about 15%
of the world's the nitrogen- and sulfur-based pollutants. Those
pollutants contribute to the lung irritant ozone, haze and acidic
fallout.</TE>
<TE>   Yet ships are among the least controlled pollution sources in the
world. They typically have no emissions controls and burn a low-grade
diesel fuel that produces 50 times more haze-forming pollutants than
the dirtiest diesel trucks on U.S. highways.</TE>
<TE>   As part of its announcement Wednesday, the EPA also promised to
consider measures to cut emissions from U.S.-owned ships at least 30%
by 2007. Yet that level of pollution control, which was contained in
the EPA regulation as recently as a few weeks ago, was rejected by
officials of the Bush administration intent on keeping controls on
U.S. ships in line with commercial vessels operated by other nations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to enforce this international regulation for our
ships in the United States and we're considering whether to go beyond
that to reduce [smog-forming] nitrogen oxide emissions beyond what
the international community has done," said Margo Oge, director of
EPA's office of transportation and air quality.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA's decision won praise from industry representatives, who
had lobbied to prevent the agency from pursuing controls for ships
more aggressive than other nations. They questioned whether the
United States has authority to order foreign ships to comply with
U.S. environmental standards.</TE>
<TE>   "That is a very progressive and positive step," said Jonathan
Benner, a lobbyist for the International Assn. of Independent Tanker
Owners, which represents operators of 2,000 ships around the world.
"We need a global standard that follows a ship as it makes its way
from port to port around the world."</TE>
<TE>   But the proposal infuriated environmentalists, who have pressured
the EPA for years to crack down on ship emissions. They vowed to
return to court to seek more stringent controls. State and local air
quality officials expressed dismay; they lack direct authority over
ships, but say they will be hard-pressed to meet health-based air
pollution standards without reductions from ship smokestacks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a ridiculous regulation. There is absolutely zero air
quality benefit here," said Russell Long of San Francisco-based
Bluewater Network, a plaintiff in the lawsuit. "The Bush
administration has punted again. This is terrible news for Americans
living around coastal cities because ships are among the world's
biggest polluters."</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't give us much, that's for sure," said Doug Allard,
executive officer for the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control
District, where clean-air gains are slipping away in the face of
increased shipping along the California coast. "I don't' see anything
that provides any benefit. It is disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   The workhorses of international commerce, ships carry 65% of all
consumer goods used in the United States as well as millions of
tourists cruising to Alaska, Mexico, Bermuda and the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to controlling ships, we are about where we were
with cars in 1965," said James Corbett, professor of marine policy at
the University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles region, no other facility produces more air
pollution than the Los Angeles-Long Beach port complex, one of the
busiest in the world. On average, 16 giant ships arrive at the ports
daily, unloading sneakers, TVs and tropical fruit and releasing more
smog-forming gases than 1 million cars. As trade around the Pacific
Rim increases, cargo shipments are expected to double in the next
decade, according to port officials.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure EPA Administrator Whitman proposed, all new
U.S.-flagged ships would be required to meet pollution limits
established under amendments to the 1997 International Convention for
the Prevention of Pollution for Ships. The accord established
variable pollution limits for different types of large ships, but
generally reduced emissions by about 11%. However, the accord permits
ships to emit 50% more sulfur-based pollutants than are found in
modern fuels. The pollution limits apply only to new ships, though it
takes nearly four decades before smoky, older vessels are ready for
replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do the standards apply to all the pollutants ships produce.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the EPA has acknowledged that even if the international
standards were fully in force, pollution from big ships would
increase by about 13% in the United States in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   Under the EPA proposal, the approximately 300 ships operated by
U.S. companies have until 2004 to meet the standard. It applies only
to U.S. vessels, although nine of every 10 vessels coming to the
nation's ports are operated by foreign companies or governments,
Corbett said.</TE>
<TE>   Oge at the EPA said that the agency will consider comments on
whether to hold foreign vessels to U.S. pollution limits at a later
date. However, officials question whether the federal government has
such authority. Environmentalists insist they do have that authority,
pointing out that the U.S. has required foreign carriers to use
double-hulled tankers and provide facilities for disabled people on
cruise ships.</TE>
<TE>   A final version of the rule is due by Jan. 31 and public comments
can be sent to the EPA. The agency plans to hold a public hearing on
the proposed regulations June 13 at Hyatt Regency in Long Beach.</TE>

<HD>Bush Refuses INS Appeal for Money</HD>
<DH>Budget: Agency wants to close visa loophole. Democrats
fume, but White House says 9/11 funds are still unspent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional Democrats assailed the White House on Wednesday for
rejecting a request by immigration authorities for more money to
close a loophole in the visa system exploited by some of the Sept. 11
hijackers, escalating an election-year flap over homeland security
spending.</LD>
<LD>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service sought $52 million to
pay for 441 more agents to pursue foreigners who overstay their
visas. But the request was turned down by Mitchell E. Daniels Jr.,
head of the Office of Management and Budget.</LD>
<LD>   An administration official said that the White House has proposed
a big increase in the INS budget for next year--evidence of its
commitment to cracking down on visa scofflaws.</LD>
<TE>   But the budget office is recommending less money than the INS
wants for the current year, the official added, because the agency
still hasn't spent a large chunk of the nearly $500 million in
post-Sept. 11 funding allocated late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Democrats accused Daniels of being tightfisted on homeland
defense needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Mitch Daniels' repeated efforts to starve homeland security of
resources has now reached a new low: Under-funding efforts that go
directly to the heart of where our law enforcement system failed on
Sept. 11," said David Sirota, a spokesman for Democrats on the House
Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Call, a spokeswoman for the White House budget office,
responded that the administration is "aggressively dealing" with the
problem of expired visas.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Sept. 11 hijackers were in the U.S. on expired visas,
according to the INS.</TE>
<TE>   An INS spokesman said the agency would not comment on the budget
dispute.</TE>
<TE>   The administration in March sent Congress an emergency spending
request for an additional $27.1 billion this year for needs linked to
the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money would go to the Pentagon, with the rest directed
toward a wide range of other activities, from the New York recovery
effort to homeland security.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also has proposed a $38-billion increase in
homeland security in next year's budget, which would include hiking
the enforcement budget for the INS by $1.2 billion, to $5.3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some of that money would go to set up a $362-million system to
track the arrival and departure of noncitizens, expected to be
complete by the fall of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the INS has 1,950 agents performing a wide range of
enforcement activities, from gathering intelligence on suspected
terrorists to hunting down visa violators.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute over whether to funnel more money to the INS comes
less than a week after the House voted to split up the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure, which is pending in the Senate, its law
enforcement and service roles would be handled by separate bureaus
within the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The INS has come under persistent attack as a poorly managed
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Critics lambaste it for mishandling paperwork, losing track of
deportees and meting out justice with different standards in
different parts of the country.</TE>

<HD>Hawaii Is Poised to Allow Doctors to Assist Suicides</HD>
<DH>Law: It would be the second state to permit euthanasia. A
federal judge recently blocked U.S. efforts to sanction physicians in
Oregon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hawaii is expected to become the second state to allow
physician-assisted suicide, two weeks after a judge rebuffed the
federal government's attempt to ban the practice in Oregon.</LD>
<LD>   The state Senate is scheduled to take a final vote today on a law
nearly identical to the Oregon statute. After an emotional debate
Tuesday night, the measure passed the Senate on an initial vote of 13
to 12, leaving both sides scrambling over the next 48 hours to line
up votes for a final reading, required under state law.</LD>
<LD>   "The proponents have been tenacious. For the people in our
community who are opposed to assisted suicide, if they do nothing, we
will have physician-assisted suicide in Hawaii," said Kelly Rosati, a
spokeswoman for the Hawaii Family Forum, an organization that has
mobilized grass-roots opposition to the legislation.</LD>
<TE>   The state House of Representatives approved two "death with
dignity" bills in early March. But the measure was stalled in the
Hawaii Senate, in part because of U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's
move to sanction doctors in Oregon who prescribed lethal drugs under
that state's law.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's directive, issued in November, found that doctors who
prescribe drugs such as barbiturates to hasten the death of the
terminally ill are in violation of federal drug trafficking laws. But
a federal judge in Oregon ruled last month that Ashcroft had
overstepped his authority, a development that helped revive the
stalled legislation in Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, lawyers for patients in Oregon who had sued to
challenge the Ashcroft directive filed a claim in federal court
seeking nearly $1 million in attorney's fees. The claim was filed
under a statute that allows reimbursement for citizens who must use
the courts to enforce their rights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that you have an ideological decision on the
part of the attorney general that is now going to be paid for by the
taxpayers," said Kathryn Tucker, legal director for Compassion in
Dying, who helped represent the patients who sued.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department has said it is considering an appeal of
U.S. District Judge Robert Jones' ruling, but has not yet filed one.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on April 1, the Netherlands became the first country to
fully legalize euthanasia, sanctioning what effectively had been the
practice in that country for many years. Similar legislation is
expected to become law in Belgium.</TE>
<TE>   In Hawaii, the biggest procedural stumbling block has been put up
by state Sen. David Matsuura, chairman of the Health and Human
Services Committee. Until this week, he had refused to move the bill
forward, despite approval of a nearly identical measure in the state
House.</TE>
<TE>   Senators voted 15 to 10 on Tuesday night to recall the bill to the
floor, then adopted it on an initial vote. Today's vote, if the
numbers hold, would constitute final passage. One of the Senate's
three Republicans, Bob Hogue of eastern Oahu, was among those voting
for the measure.</TE>
<TE>   The bill is nearly identical in wording to Oregon's statute,
adopted as a voter initiative. The law took effect in 1997; so far,
91 terminally ill Oregonians have taken their lives with a
physician's help. The law requires that applicants be diagnosed with
less than six months to live and be free of depression. Patients must
reconfirm their decisions after the request.</TE>
<TE>   Several senators in Tuesday's debate challenged the value of those
safeguards.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about death with dignity, this is death by murder,"
Republican Sen. Fred Hummings said. "There's nothing dignified about
asking a doctor to put someone to death."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Robert Nakata, a Democrat and a Methodist minister, spoke
in favor of the legislation. "I believe that death is an integral
part of life, and if we could look at it in that sense, we can
welcome death when our time comes," Nakata said.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, it'll be a death with a lot of dignity; time to say
our goodbyes and move on."</TE>

<HD>College Further From Poor's Grasp, Study Shows</HD>
<DH>Economics: Twice as much money must be set aside for
tuition as in 1980. State budget crises make matters worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>College tuition costs have increasingly eroded Americans' family
finances over the last two decades, and current state budget crises
are starting to make matters even worse, a new analysis says.</LD>
<LD>   A combination of big tuition hikes and lagging increases in
financial aid has hit the nation's lowest-income families especially
hard, the report found. The percentage of their income required to
pay for tuition has nearly doubled since 1980.</LD>
<LD>   The report, released Wednesday by the nonprofit National Center
for Public Policy and Higher Education in San Jose, said that "only
the wealthiest families have seen their incomes keep pace with
increases in tuition. The lowest-income families have lost the most
ground, and this is a major factor in their lower rates of college
attendance" than students from higher-income families.</LD>
<TE>   The analysis did not evaluate the state-by-state impact. But the
center, in an earlier evaluation, ranked California as one of the
best in the nation in promoting affordable higher education, largely
by maintaining the lowest community college tuition fees.</TE>
<TE>   According to the new report, Americans--particularly those from
high- and middle-income families--continue to flock to college in
record numbers.</TE>
<TE>   But, the report said, students and their families have paid for
college by working longer hours, cutting back on other types of
personal spending or borrowing more heavily.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowing to pay for college increased among students from
families at all income levels during the 1990s. For seniors from
low-income families attending public four-year schools, debt loads
averaged $12,888 in the 1999-2000 school year, up 69% from 10 years
earlier, even after adjusting for inflation.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick M. Callan, president of the think tank that produced the
report, said "the need to borrow a lot of money is a real inhibitor
for some students to enroll" in college, especially low-income
students.</TE>
<TE>   To provide a rough measure of the impact that higher tuition is
having on families, the center compared the rise in college
attendance costs with Americans' income growth over the past two
decades. The analysis found that, among families whose earnings are
in the bottom 20% of the economic ladder, average tuition at public
four year-colleges amounted to 25% of their annual incomes in 2000.
That was up from 13% in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Callan said that most low-income families actually pay lower
percentages of their income to cover tuition, because these families
often receive some cash aid to offset college costs.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he and other researchers maintained that the report's
figures accurately reflect the general trend of an increasing burden
on families, particularly low-income families.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Baum, a Skidmore College economist specializing in higher
education finance, concurred with the report's finding that for the
lowest-income families, college "has become dramatically less
affordable."</TE>
<TE>   She added that financial aid alone can't solve the affordability
problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to think about how to deliver quality education without
having [college] costs go up as rapidly as they have been," Baum
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts, citing the wide availability of student loans,
argue that factors such as poor high schools that provide weak
preparation for college are an even bigger barrier than cost for
low-income youths.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that recent double-digit tuition increases by
public schools in states such as Virginia, North and South Carolina,
Washington, Illinois and Ohio are expected to further squeeze
families financially.</TE>
<TE>   Those tuition increases are intended to offset state cutbacks in
higher education spending due to a faltering national economy.</TE>
<TE>   California faces a budget shortfall of $20 billion or more, but so
far the state's university and community college systems have
proposed no fee increases for residents for the coming school year.</TE>
<TE>   The report noted that sharp tuition increases are typical during
economic downturns, even though they deepen economic hardship for
many families.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a cycle that needs to be broken," Callan said. He added
that California approved "egregious" increases in fees during the
state's early 1990s recession.</TE>
<TE>   The report points out how policymakers at the federal level, and
in many states, increasingly have directed educational finance
benefits to middle-class families rather than the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The federal programs benefiting the middle class include the Hope
Scholarship tax credit and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit, which
were enacted in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The credits are available to joint tax filers earning up to
$100,000 but provide no benefit to families earning too little to pay
taxes.</TE>

<HD>Child-Care Issue Dominates Debate Over Welfare Bill</HD>
<DH>Congress: In the House, the measure turned into a polarized
clash over treatment of the poor and states' rights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A major Republican welfare plan is sparking a new dispute over child
care, with Democrats arguing that a big spending hike is crucial to a
goal shared by both parties: helping more low-income mothers go to
work.</LD>
<LD>   The flare-up over child care came Wednesday as a House committee
was finishing its work on the $16.5-billion welfare plan, which is
expected to pass the Republican-controlled chamber before Memorial
Day.</LD>
<LD>   But as the welfare bill has gained momentum in the House, a series
of potentially explosive issues has turned what began as a collegial
review of social policy into an increasingly polarized clash over
treatment of the poor and the states' freedom to set their own
course.</LD>
<TE>   "We're dealing today with an issue that is a rather passionate
issue on both sides," said Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), chairman of
the Education and Workforce Committee, urging his colleagues "to
respect the views of members on both sides of the aisle."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the day, House members jousted over how much education
people should be allowed to receive while also getting aid, how many
hours welfare recipients should be required to work and whether the
federal government should declare poverty reduction a formal policy
goal.</TE>
<TE>   They reached little agreement: "We are disappointed that the
majority has rejected every opportunity we presented to provide the
resources necessary to make welfare reform successful--adequate child
care, education and training to secure jobs needed to lift people out
of poverty, and flexibility to operate the program," said Rep. George
Miller of Martinez, the senior Democrat on the Education and
Workforce Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the things that states are saying they need to make the
program work, and Congress should not reform the welfare program
without them."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have depicted welfare reform, approved in 1996, as a
great success, noting that the nation's public aid rolls have fallen
by more than half with little of the social disruption predicted by
Democratic critics at the time. Instead, poverty rates generally have
fallen, although by all accounts, many former welfare recipients
continue to struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "It has transformed the lives of millions of families and helped
them achieve self-sufficiency," Boehner said Wednesday, comparing the
historic importance of welfare reform to civil rights legislation of
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve the next step in welfare reform, the GOP plan would
impose a strict work requirement of 24 hours on many single parents
who go to school or participate in other allowable activities during
the remaining 16 hours of the workweek. The current, more flexible
rules allow many welfare recipients to attend a year of vocational
education rather than go to work.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals to increase work requirements are coupled with
proposals to enforce a stricter definition of work, which has
prompted some state officials to complain that the administration
plan would reduce state flexibility. In addition, House Republicans
have declined to restore welfare funding for immigrants, which was
largely taken away in 1996 and which civil rights groups have been
pushing for.</TE>
<TE>   "The differences did not appear to be that great when the
president introduced his bill," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin of
Maryland, whose own welfare bill is the chief Democratic alternative
to the White House plan. "But when you look closely at it, we have
serious issues."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats argued Wednesday that proposals to demand more work of
parents on welfare were the very reason that more should be spent on
child care. In much of the country, public child-care programs have
waiting lists, and Democrats contended that such lists would get
longer if more low-income mothers were required to leave their homes
for the workplace.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the waiting list for publicly funded child care
numbers about 200,000 and can take years, according to the California
Department of Social Services.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a glaring, glaring source of problems for moving the
[welfare] system to its next stage," Miller said at one point,
adding: "Why don't we just bite the bullet and do it right?"</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to make welfare reform work ... we must take care
of their children for a few hours a day longer," said Rep. Tim Roemer
(D-Ind.).</TE>
<TE>   The government's main child-care programs total $4.8 billion,
which the Bush administration would leave unchanged. Republicans have
contended that the nation actually spends substantially more on child
care if other programs, such as Head Start, are considered. Moreover,
they say that their budget proposal to hold spending relatively
steady should be viewed against a backdrop of much smaller welfare
rolls than in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   On a party-line vote, the Education and Workforce Committee turned
down Miller's amendment to gradually increase spending on child care
by $8 billion a year. On another party-line vote it approved a GOP
plan to increase child-care spending in one of the federal
government's programs to $2.3 billion, from $2.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic criticisms of the GOP welfare proposal may resonate
with the public. Six in 10 voters said that expansion of training,
child care and other work supports should be the priority in the next
welfare law, according to an April survey conducted by Peter D. Hart
Research Associates for the National Campaign for Jobs and Income
Support, which has been highly critical of the GOP approach.</TE>
<TE>   Only 15% of those polled in the national survey agreed that
tougher work requirements should be the priority.</TE>
<TE>   While Republican leaders probably can muster enough votes to pass
the welfare plan in the House, its prospects in the
Democrat-controlled Senate are uncertain. Concerns about child-care
funding, promoting marriage and increased work requirements have a
constituency among that chamber's Democrats. As a result, observers
expect that any House-Senate deal will require modification.</TE>

<HD>Can Gays Be Good Priests?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS W. KMIEC</AU>
<BD>Douglas W. Kmiec is dean of the Catholic University of
America School of Law.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Catholic tradition holds that God can find good even in the most
profound evil. Great evil has apparently been lurking in the church
for a while, so God may have his work cut out for him. Yet the
outlines of good are beginning to emerge.</LD>
<LD>   After having been taken to the Vatican woodshed, the American
cardinals, "in communion with the Holy Father," minced no words in
finding child abuse to be "rightly considered a crime by society and
an appalling sin" to be promptly reported to civil authority.</LD>
<LD>   The larger issue, which was not addressed, is homosexuality and
the priesthood. On this, the cardinals' communique was largely
silent, other than to note that "almost all the cases involved
adolescents and therefore were not cases of true pedophilia." True
enough, but therein lies the real issue: how to reassure the faithful
of proper priestly behavior when it is largely unknown whether or,
more realistically, how many priests are gay.</LD>
<TE>   Catholic teaching maintains that homosexuals do not choose their
orientation, as "its psychological genesis remains largely
unexplained," according to the 1994 "Catechism of the Catholic
Church." For this reason and the even more basic belief that all of
us are created in God's image, these persons must be "accepted with
respect, compassion and sensitivity." Yet while decrying any form of
"unjust discrimination," the church posits that homosexuals must
remain chaste.</TE>
<TE>   No entity in society has fully come to terms with this combination
of beliefs. To avoid unjust discrimination, some government entities
have sought to simply add sexual orientation to fair housing,
employment and other civil rights laws. This, however, is a problem
for those who do not want the law to be understood as explicitly or
implicitly affirming homosexual practice.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado voters thought they could solve the dilemma in 1992 by
forbidding local governments from adding sexual orientation to civil
rights laws. The Supreme Court sent that effort at direct democracy
into the dustbin.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, federal courts largely have accepted President
Clinton's "don't ask, don't tell" policy for the military. Some
people contend that this unjustly excludes celibate but frank
homosexuals from national service.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it may be that the human personality is incapable of the
perfection of chastity that the Catholic Church promotes. Cardinal
Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia has not only been one of the
strongest proponents of "zero tolerance" for priests with a history
of child abuse but also has proposed that "a person who is
homosexually oriented is not a suitable candidate for the priesthood,
even if he has never committed any homosexual act." The cardinal
reasons that, for a person with a homosexual orientation, the "risks"
of being unchaste in the male-dominated priestly life "may be too
high."</TE>
<TE>   The Bevilacqua statement deserves serious and respectful thought.
The cardinal himself acknowledges, however, that there probably are
homosexually oriented priests who have scrupulously observed their
obligation to remain chaste. Though a celibate heterosexual who
enters the seminary and refrains from sexual activity can be said to
be giving up the moral good of family and marriage and a chaste
homosexual has forgone only a moral wrong, is it not the same
prayerful, total gift to God?</TE>
<TE>   Could the candid discussion of these matters be the greater good
that God has planned to arise out of the present scandal? There has
been much clamoring to end priestly celibacy--the giving of an
"undivided heart to the Lord." But could it be that God intends the
reaffirmation of this practice to signal the renewed and open welcome
of heterosexual and homosexual priest alike, so long as both are
living faithfully within that vow?</TE>

<HD>Tough Gigs for Superheroes, Superpowers</HD>
<DH>For Uncle Sam, like Spider-Man, power brings
responsibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York. E-mail: pinkerto@ix.netcom.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Spider-Man and Uncle Sam have the same problem: They barely know
their own strength. But as the movie "Spider-Man," which opens
Friday, reminds us, "With great power comes great responsibility."
That's the challenge faced by superheroes and superpowers.</LD>
<LD>   In the comic-book-turned-movie, Peter Parker is just an ordinary
high school kid until he is bitten by a radioactivity-mutated spider.
Thus, he is marked for destiny.</LD>
<LD>   Although Spider-Man commits himself to righting wrongs, he never
gets credit for his good deeds. As another character tells him, "In
spite of everything you've done for them, eventually they will hate
you."</LD>
<TE>   Uncle Sam must know the feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Through the 19th century, the United States was a marginal
country, far from the main global stage where the big countries--the
international equivalent of jocks and cheerleaders--were at the
center. The U.S. made a spectacular debut in 1917, when the
idealistic President Woodrow Wilson led the nation into World War I,
promising to abolish tyranny and establish what he called the League
of Peace thereafter. Wilson's early efforts at a new world order
failed, but the U.S. rise to superpowerdom was only delayed, not
derailed.</TE>
<TE>   After Pearl Harbor, the United States donned the
red-white-and-blue cape of world leadership and has never taken it
off. The watershed event that stamped the U.S. as a country of unique
might was the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the United States is, if anything, more dominant. The
Washington-based Center for Defense Information calculates that the
U.S. spends more on defense than the next 15 nations combined.
Moreover, the Pentagon's budget is 25 times as large as the combined
military spending of the seven nations identified by the Pentagon as
our most likely adversaries: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea,
Sudan and Syria.</TE>
<TE>   And surely our swift and virtually casualty-free victory in
Afghanistan seems almost magical in the eyes of even hardened foreign
observers. The U.S. has done the world a favor by defeating fascism
and communism. But, as Spider-Man discovered, no good deed goes
unpunished.</TE>
<TE>   The 1958 novel by Eugene Burdick and William J. Lederer, "The Ugly
American," helped set the tone for subsequent criticism of our
foreign policy. So although the nation has been by far the largest
foreign-aid donor of the last half-century, critics reply that we
give away a lower percentage of our wealth than other industrialized
countries. Indeed, today it's not hard to find an anti-American
demonstration going on somewhere in the world--including here at
home.</TE>
<TE>   Most Americans probably find such feelings hard to fathom, but as
John Adams observed two centuries ago, "Power always thinks it has a
great soul and vast views beyond the comprehension of the weak." In
Adams' time, that insight applied mostly to other countries; today,
it applies mostly to us. Thus the slightest flick of Uncle Sam's
wrist can send countries and continents into commotion.</TE>
<TE>   Hence the lonely conundrum of American power; in countries ranging
from Vietnam in the 1960s to Iran in the '70s to Lebanon in the '80s
to Somalia in the '90s, Uncle Sam proved unable to convince the
locals that he was there to help them.</TE>
<TE>   American strategists would do well to take the advice of the
kindly Uncle Ben in "Spider-Man," who reminds his mutantly powerful
nephew, "Just because you can beat someone up doesn't give you the
right to."</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that many Americans would like to shuck off the mantle
of world power. Spider-Man knows the feeling. As he says, "It wasn't
always like this. There was a time when life was a lot less
complicated." But even in his fantastic universe, there's no turning
back the clock. And so resigned to his arachnid-powered fate, he
concludes: "This is my gift. This is my curse."</TE>
<TE>   And so we are left with Spider-Man atop a skyscraper, watching and
waiting, powerful and yet also responsible. And so it is for Uncle
Sam, the economic and military colossus. It's lonely at the top, but
he has no choice now but to remain on duty. Yet if our prudence
matches our puissance, the story will have a happy ending.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Tilts to Israel for Good Reason</HD>
<DH>Palestinians target civilians and sacrifice their own
children in battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palestinian representatives and their pan-Arab sympathizers often
complain that the United States favors Israel in the Middle East
conflict and that we approach every peace negotiation with that
unalterable bias in mind.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush, like all his predecessors, has found it
politically expedient to deny this, mostly because our dependence on
Saudi oil and investments necessitates tact and sometimes even
outright pandering.</LD>
<LD>   But the truth is that we do favor the Israelis, morally that is,
and there is a simple reason for this. They don't murder children.</LD>
<TE>   That is not to say, however, that they are blameless. Any
reasonable, well-informed person, including many American Jews, will
readily concede that the Israelis aren't saints. As one woman told me
recently, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon "is a bull."</TE>
<TE>   They, like us, have been responsible for civilian deaths during
war and tactical incursions. But there is a big difference between
attempting to avoid but sometimes inflicting civilian casualties (in
this case, by risking booby traps and going house to house on foot as
the Israeli army has been doing) and targeting civilians purposely,
as Al Qaeda did Sept. 11 and as Palestinian gunmen did Saturday when
they rushed into the Adora settlement and killed four noncombatants,
including a 5-year-old girl, at home on the Sabbath. The moral
difference is all in the intent.</TE>
<TE>   What must it take to pull the trigger on a 5-year-old cowering on
a bed?</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the response to all of this is that Israel too has
killed defenseless civilians, including children. Remember the
12-year-old Palestinian boy and his father caught in an alcove during
a shootout? They were pictured ubiquitously in the news a year and a
half ago as symbols of Israeli brutality. But a recent report has
called into question whether the boy was killed by Israelis or
Palestinians. Regardless, he was killed in cross-fire, not purposely.
That matters.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, though that boy was a noncombatant, as his father's
furiously waving a white flag indicated, many are not. Yet
Palestinian representatives in the West either ignore this or omit
mention of it.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a typical screed from Columbia University professor Edward
Said:</TE>
<TE>   "The monstrous transformation of an entire people by a formidable
and feared propaganda machine into little more than militants and
terrorists has allowed not just Israel's military but its fleet of
writers and defenders to efface a terrible history of injustice,
suffering and abuse in order to destroy the civil existence of the
Palestinian people with impunity.... Are Palestinian civilian men,
women and children no more than rats or cockroaches that can be
attacked and killed in the thousands without so much as a word of
compassion or in their defense?"</TE>
<TE>   Now consider this statement, from a Middle East Media Research
Institute report quoting Abu Jendal of Islamic Jihad, who was
interviewed several times by the Al Jazeera satellite television
network during recent fighting in the Jenin refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Believe me, there are children stationed in the houses with
explosive belts at their sides," Jendal said. "Today, one of the
children came to me with his school bag. I asked him what he wanted,
and he replied, 'Instead of books, I want an explosive device, in
order to attack.' "</TE>
<TE>   And again, the institute's Web site reported that the Islamic
Jihad commander in Jenin, Mahmoud Tawalbeh (later found dead), had
prevented Palestinian civilians from leaving the camp.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic Jihad announcement went on to say that Tawalbeh "had
thwarted all attempts by the occupation to evacuate the camp
residents to make it easier for the Israelis to destroy [the camp] on
the heads of the fighters."</TE>
<TE>   In light of this shocking news, we have to ask ourselves if we can
treat with moral equivalence a group of people who not only execute
enemy children in their homes but also send their own children and
other civilians into battle and still have the audacity to pretend
outrage when these individuals are killed.</TE>
<TE>   Is it any mystery we disfavor them?</TE>

<LD>Native American groups have lobbied public schools, colleges and
universities since the 1960s to give up sports nicknames, mascots and
logos such as Indians, Braves and Chiefs. Stanford stopped being the
Indians 30 years ago. The Los Angeles Unified School District banned
Native American mascots in 1997. Still, about 60 schools in
California, from the elementary level through high school, continue
to have some form of Indian nickname and mascot.</LD>
<LD>   That would change in a stroke if the Legislature and Gov. Gray
Davis approved Assembly Bill 2112, by Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg
(D-Los Angeles). The measure, which also applies to colleges, has
zipped through two Assembly committees without a single opposing
vote. Democrats are voting for it and Republicans are abstaining.</LD>
<LD>   Clearly there is a fear of being labeled politically incorrect in
an election year. There is also the matter of the huge political
clout amassed by tribes in recent years via millions of dollars in
campaign contributions.</LD>
<TE>   There's no dispute that Indian nicknames and the stereotypical
antics of their mascots, such as feather-adorned warriors stomping
out mock war dances, can be demeaning. Yes, it's time for these
mascots to go. But those decisions should be made by the local school
boards or governing bodies of colleges and universities.
Administrators should not look to Sacramento to make tough decisions
for them.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's bill also would ban any nickname that is deemed
derogatory or discriminatory against any race, ethnicity or
nationality. The state Board of Education and the Postsecondary
Education Commission would draft a list of such terms. This seems to
create a solution for a problem that doesn't exist. Are we worried
about the Fighting Irish?</TE>
<TE>   All public schools should certainly put away their tom-toms,
pseudo war dances and tomahawks and find other appropriate mascots.
Here's a case where educators who complain about the heavy hand of
Sacramento should keep their authority--and then use it.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the urban war-zone version of the old Cold War drill. Gangs
trade fire on the streets bordering Gates Elementary School. Children
who are as familiar with the sound of gunshots as they are school
bells stop finger-painting or multiplying fractions and dive under a
desk.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Mayor James K. Hahn stood in front of this besieged
Lincoln Heights school and announced a citywide anti-gang initiative.
He's in a hurry to do something about gangs, and no wonder: The body
count from shootings citywide already stands at 184, a 67% increase
over this time last year. His Los Angeles Safe Neighborhood Action
Plan, which he has given the snappy acronym L.A. SNAP, calls for
putting police drop-in centers in 40 city parks to deter gang
battles. Hahn wants to boot 100 police officers from desk work to
street patrol and reopen a citywide "cold phone" for reporting crime
tips anonymously. He also wants to match kids from high-crime
neighborhoods with city jobs.</LD>
<TE>   SNAP attempts to marry approaches that too often pit proponents in
bitter opposition. Cops, prosecutors and judges, who spend their
lives confronting kids who blow their peers to pieces, tend to tout
individual responsibility and crack down hard on troublemakers.
Activists and social workers, who visit budding gangsters in homes
that are often squalid or reigned over by an abusive parent, believe
that opportunity, not jail, is the cure for a problem that spans
generations. The mayor's unified approach shows that he has embraced
the best thinking on how to end gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   But SNAP is disconcertingly sketchy. It's up to Hahn to make it
more than the sort of squishy "accomplishment" that politicians
sometimes stockpile for use at election time.</TE>
<TE>   One way the plan falls short is by failing to determine whether a
component works or doesn't--the same civic sloppiness that has let
gangs go on killing each other for decades. For instance, the mayor
has earmarked an extra $1.3 million in grants for the city's existing
intervention program, L.A. Bridges II, even though no one knows if it
reduces violence.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, then-City Controller Rick Tuttle audited L.A.
Bridges I, a related prevention program aimed at younger kids, and
found that the city Community Development Department had managed it
poorly. The audit also noted that City Council members' efforts to
grab a piece of the program for their districts (surprise!) diluted
its effectiveness. Maybe Bridges II is better. But battle-scarred
neighborhoods can't afford for the mayor to shovel more cash into
unproven programs.</TE>
<TE>   If tough review would strengthen Hahn's plan, so would putting
someone in charge of it. When asked who would lead SNAP, Hahn called
it a team effort. Well, teams need leaders. And the city needs one
person who is responsible for drawing together local, county, state
and federal anti-gang efforts and for screaming if they don't show
results. Hahn's commitment is critical, but he needs to give that
commitment a face and a phone number that's easier to reach than a
busy mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The ideal choice would be someone committed to solutions, not
politics, whose ideology falls somewhere between former LAPD Chief
Daryl Gates (philosophy: club the thugs) and
former-lawmaker-turned-gang-interventionist Tom Hayden (hug the
lugs).</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Hahn would be well served to remember that gangs spill
blood in neighborhoods, not City Hall, and to appoint a leader who
could use the city's money, personnel and expertise to bolster the
efforts of the people whose children are shooting and being shot. In
December, Gates Elementary School had just let out its students when,
according to police, suspected gang members shot and killed a rival
as he waited to pick up his child. He crashed into the car parked in
front of his and tumbled out the door in front of hundreds of
horrified children.</TE>
<TE>   For a city to teach children to "duck and cover" is capitulation,
not a solution. It's what politicians have been doing for years.</TE>

<LD>On April 19, the United States sponsored a U.N. Security Council
resolution expressing concern about "the dire humanitarian situation
of the Palestinian civilian population, in particular, reports from
the Jenin refugee camp of an unknown number of deaths and
destruction."</LD>
<LD>   The council unanimously voted to send a fact-finding team to
Jenin. Israel agreed but then objected and continued to resist even
as the United Nations met the conditions it imposed--that a military
expert be added, that Israeli soldiers not be prosecuted, that
Israel's complaints about terror attacks launched from the camp be
investigated.</LD>
<LD>   The United States was silent when it should have been speaking
forcefully. When doing so serves justice, Washington should not
hesitate to pressure Israel, its strongest ally in the Middle East,
its fellow democracy, its largest recipient of aid at $3 billion a
year. Palestinian claims of hundreds of deaths appear exaggerated.
Israel puts the death toll at about 50 and says most of the
fatalities were Palestinian fighters, not civilians. Twenty-three
Israeli soldiers were killed. Whatever the numbers, Israel's refusal
to admit finders of fact gave the appearance of something to hide.</LD>
<TE>   In these days of Arab satellite television broadcasting pictures
of dead Palestinians around the clock, Israel has long lost the
battle of perception concerning Jenin. Palestinians and their
supporters believe that what happened at the camp constitutes a war
crime. So far as is known, it does not. But a determination of how
many people died under what conditions would have benefited Israel.
The United States is suffering from the perception that it has given
a green light to Israel to attack Palestinians at will.</TE>
<TE>   The belief, no matter how mistaken, that Israeli troops conducted
a wanton slaughter in Jenin will further inflame potential suicide
bombers and make it harder for Arab governments to pressure
Palestinian instigators. Israel continues to take the actions it
believes are necessary in what it considers a fight for survival. But
to survive as a robust democracy, it must adhere to certain rules
even when its opponents do not.</TE>
<TE>   Washington does Israel no favors by acquiescing whenever its
leaders make their own rules. In the long run, U.S. weakness only
delays the end of violence.</TE>

<LD>Re "Count Them and Cut Them," editorial, April 30: Between the
billboard lobbyists with their fat wallets and the serenity-loving
aesthetes who want a city free of commercial clutter lies an
unremarked group possibly larger than either: those for whom
billboards serve a valuable purpose.</LD>
<LD>   Who are they--we?--who respond to billboards by buying products
and ordering the services they advertise? If they--we?--didn't use
the information thus conveyed, it wouldn't be good business to
advertise on billboards. And if it weren't good business, the
lobbyists' wallets wouldn't be fat.</LD>

<LD>Robert Scheer, true to form, plays the knee-jerk role of apologist
for homosexuals, claiming that they are being scapegoated for
priestly scandals in the Catholic Church ("Blame Church Arrogance,
Not Oversexed Society," Commentary, April 30). It is part of the
Catholic catechism that homosexuality is an intrinsically disordered
evil and homosexual conduct is regarded as a grave moral sin. Such
individuals who celebrate and flaunt the sin of homosexuality have no
place either in the Catholic priesthood or as deacons or eucharistic
ministers. Priestly pederasty is directly linked to homosexual
orientation.</LD>
<LD>   Celibacy is the gem of our church, where a chaste priest gives
himself entirely to the service of Christ. As for women in the
priesthood, forget it! When a priest celebrates Mass, where he
transforms bread and wine into the true living body and blood of
Christ, he does so "in persona" of Christ. In short, he assumes in
the male form the place of Christ in the Last Supper.</LD>
<LD>   Stanislaus Pulle</LD>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scheer's commentary is another example of his journalism--an
overindulgence in rhetoric at the expense of balanced consideration.
As if the church's reaction to the scandal was only to blame the
social climate for the problem. As if the church was not profoundly
mortified and no action from the pope on down was being taken to
arrive at a solution.</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Scheer, the Catholic Church is not an institution dedicated to
molesting youth and then concealing the crime. It is the bedrock of
Western civilization. It has formulated the intellectual and moral
basis for the very misdeeds for which it is now justly brought to
task. As it has done many times before, the church will again right
itself and continue on its religious and humanizing mission. As to
your flippant suggestion that the church should emulate the wisdom of
Pogo ("We have met the enemy and he is us"), perhaps you should
yourself take that suggestion to heart next time you undertake to
expose the evils of this world.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kaczorowski</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finally, it has been simply stated by Scheer. The immediate
notification to the proper outside authorities upon discovery of any
criminal sexual behavior was all that was ever expected of the
Catholic Church. Massive doses of humility and admission of needing
help with the problem are all that is asked now.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Catholic Church holds itself out as the "one true
church," infallible in matters of faith and morals, the temptation to
defend this arrogance and justify this lofty position is high. When
the preservation of the institution becomes more important than what
it set out to accomplish, blame and denial are a common position but
the harder course. The church's shortfall from its own perceived
perfection does not mean it has to go away. It is only infallible in
its own eyes anyway.</TE>

<LD>Re "Real Men Don't Blow Up Innocents," April 26: Norah Vincent takes
up the classic rhetoric of those who want to kill others: that they
are not really human, thus relieving the murderer's conscience. She
likens Palestinian bombers to "rogue elephants," who supposedly kill
because they have been "improperly socialized." She seems to think
that the Muslim view of women is further evidence for nonhumanity.
She contrasts suicide bombers with the Sept. 11 heroes, who are
described as "real men." But let us not forget that great bravery is
also required to give up life with awful explosive certainty and that
great devotion is needed to do this for a greater cause. The suicide
bombers are attacking because (in Vincent's words) "their cultural
cues told them it was their duty to do so."</LD>
<LD>   Clearly the intentional killing of innocents (by both sides) is
evil, but the bravery of a suicide bomber is in no more doubt than
the bravery of a Sept. 11 hero, or the bravery of Israeli soldiers.</LD>

What does government want us to do? The Justice Department prosecuted

replace MTBE with ethanol, which will force me to pay more for
gasoline. Where does government micromanagement end? I thought

<LD>I congratulate The Times for printing Keith Taylor's April 27 Voices
essay, "Leave God Out of This Patriot's (Ball) Games." It rightfully
deals with the shameless intolerance toward atheists so overtly
practiced among members of religious faiths. I and, I am sure, Mr.
Taylor don't just tolerate but sincerely respect the beliefs of
others. Atheists, agnostics and other dissidents do not impose their
nonbeliefs upon others. By all means, share your various different
beliefs with me, but please respect my abstinence.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Victor</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taylor is right on about how collectively this God nonsense is
giving the impression that we are a nation of believers in an
invisible "man" that can do anything to anyone. I wish people of
faith would keep their faith to themselves and not burden the world
with their ideas. As John Lennon said, ''Imagine . . . no hell below
us, above us only sky.''</TE>
<TE>   Steve Bell</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taylor wrote, "'God Bless America' is definitely a prayer." Yes,
it is. A prayer that this nation will continue to be blessed by God.
How awful can it be for a nation to ask for God's blessing?</TE>
<TE>   He wrote of how the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools
could not hurt. No, it can't. Can you imagine children coming in and
seeing, "Thou shalt not kill"? Surely this would precipitate a remedy
with regard to the problem of classmates killing one another. He
wrote, "None of those things matter much taken separately, but
collectively they deliver a message." Yes, they do. The message is
that as a nation we should not be foolish enough to leave God out of
anything.</TE>
<TE>   He referred to his atheistic views being countered with statements
that the U.S. is a "Christian nation." Yes, it is. Patrick Henry said
it best: "It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this
great nation was founded, not by religionists, but by Christians; not
on religions, but on the gospel of Jesus Christ."</TE>

<LD>Re "State Prison System $277 Million in the Red,'' April 25: As if we
needed one more reason to amend California's three-strikes law, we
now have 277 million more of them. At some point the obscene amount
of money the state spends incarcerating nonviolent offenders must be
addressed, and amending the law to apply to violent offenders would
save the state about $800 million per year.</LD>
<LD>   Kudos to the state Senate subcommittee for voting down the
governor's proposal for yet another prison. We don't need it. We
don't want it. We do want and seriously need some balance in our
justice system.</LD>

<LD>"Redondo Beach Debates 'Heart of the City'" (April 29) states that
the city "has never achieved the success" of neighboring Hermosa
Beach and Manhattan Beach. How, pray tell, does your writer define
"success"? If this kindler, gentler seaside town with comparatively
affordable housing, tree-lined streets not perpetually packed with
cars and endless excessive McMansions is unsuccessful, then we need a
new definition for success. Only then will we find the cure for that
commercialistic, big-city blight known as progress.</LD>

<LD>State water officials said Wednesday an environmental study of the
3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch housing project on Ventura County's
southeast boundary should not advance through the approval process
until questions concerning water quality are answered.</LD>
<LD>   Melinda Becker, supervisor of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board's pollution division, requested an extension of
a public comment period so concerns raised by state officials can be
addressed.</LD>
<LD>   The comment period was scheduled to close Wednesday, after hours
of public debate by opponents and supporters of the project.</LD>
<TE>   There were so many speakers, however, that a Ventura County
committee reviewing the analysis agreed to continue the hearing until
May 8. The Environment Report Review Committee will decide then
whether to formally extend the comment period, panel Chairman Bruce
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's public hearing, held at the Hall of Administration
in Ventura, Becker told committee members the state agency is
concerned about several issues it believes are not adequately
addressed.</TE>

delayed until water quality concerns are resolved.</DH>

<LD>State water officials said Wednesday an environmental study of the
3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch housing project on Ventura County's
southeast boundary should not advance through the approval process
until questions about water quality are answered.</LD>
<LD>   Melinda Becker, supervisor of the California Regional Water
Quality Control Board's pollution division, requested an extension of
a public comment period so concerns raised by state officials can be
addressed.</LD>
<LD>   The comment period was scheduled to close Wednesday, after hours
of public debate by opponents and supporters of the project. But
there were so many speakers that a Ventura County committee reviewing
the analysis agreed to continue the hearing until May 8.</LD>
<TE>   The Environmental Report Review Committee will decide then whether
to formally extend the comment period, panel Chairman Bruce Smith
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's public hearing, held at the Hall of Administration
in Ventura, Becker told committee members the state agency is
concerned about several issues it believes are not adequately
addressed. They include the amount of waste water generated by the
subdivision, pollution levels in Malibu Creek's downstream watersheds
and storm-water runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Heal the Bay, the Sierra Club and other opponents repeated the
water quality questions raised by the state board.</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Weston, attorney for developer Ahmanson Land Co., said
the water issues will be addressed when the project goes before the
Regional Water Quality Review Board for a separate review.</TE>
<TE>   "We fully expect to satisfy the water board when we go before
them," Weston said.</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Report Review Committee is going over technical
aspects of the environmental study to ensure they comply with state
law.</TE>
<TE>   If approved, the study would move to the Ventura County Planning
Commission and then the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   An initial environmental review was approved in 1992. But a
follow-up study was ordered in 1998 after biologists hired by the
developer found two endangered species on the ranch lands--the
red-legged frog and the San Fernando Valley spineflower.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists determined that both species would be affected by the
proposed subdivision but said steps could be taken to keep them from
harm. Environmentalists, several Los Angeles County politicians and
Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, an opposition group formed by Hollywood
director Rob Reiner, have criticized the report.</TE>

<HD>Man Held in Theft of Friend's Remains</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Buena Park man says he took the ashes from a Santa

<LD>Even in death, David Berry hasn't found peace.</LD>
<LD>   The charismatic Harley-Davidson enthusiast and electrician died
Oct. 31 at age 41 after a decades-long battle with kidney disease,
enduring two organ transplants and years of dialysis.</LD>
<LD>   Then 12 days ago, his sister, Jill Deckard, learned her brother's
ashes had been stolen from an urn at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa
Ana.</LD>
<TE>   Police on Wednesday arrested a friend of Berry's on suspicion of
stealing the cremated remains. The suspect, David Albert Larson, 46,
of Buena Park, told police he took the remains because he didn't
think Berry wanted to be at the cemetery, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Larson faces a felony count that could bring a prison sentence if
he is convicted. Police found Larson and the ashes, which had been
kept in a beat-up briefcase under the seat of an old GMC pickup
truck, at a home in Buena Park. The remains have since been returned
to Fairhaven Memorial Park, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Baltazar De La
Riva.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just thankful the ashes are back at the cemetery," Deckard
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after Berry's death, Deckard said, Larson began claiming
her brother owed him money and failed to return items Larson had
loaned him. Deckard said she paid Larson the money and gave him
several of the things he said he owned. But he kept coming back
wanting more, she said.Then on April 20, Deckard said, she received a
phone call from a family friend who said Larson bragged about
stealing Berry's ashes. She spent the next week trying to track
Larson down, with no luck.</TE>
<TE>   "So last Saturday, I went to the cemetery," Deckard said. "I asked
a worker to check the urn, and the worker said the ashes were gone."</TE>
<TE>   Larson, who was being held in Santa Ana Jail in lieu of $10,000
bail, denied to police that he stole the ashes as revenge against
Berry's sister.</TE>

<HD>Blake Is Denied Bail; D.A. Reveals More Details</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an emotional plea for his freedom, actor Robert Blake told a judge
Wednesday he is so severely dyslexic that he cannot read, making it
difficult to help prepare in jail his defense on murder charges.</LD>
<LD>   "Now it's my time to fight. And I can't fight in that cement room
with thousands of pages [of evidence] that I can't read." said Blake,
68, during a bail hearing in a Van Nuys courtroom.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash denied the
bail request, saying Blake is ineligible because he's charged in a
capital case in which he could have faced the death penalty.
Prosecutors have said they won't seek death for Blake.</LD>
<TE>   Blake's statement came while his attorney, Harland W. Braun, was
asking for $1-million bail for Blake. He has been held without bail
at Men's Central Jail since his April 18 arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Blake is charged with fatally shooting his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley,
last May 4, outside a Studio City restaurant. His remarks Wednesday
were his first public statements, outside his not guilty plea, since
Bakley's death.</TE>
<TE>   In another setback for Blake, prosecutors revealed more details of
their case, alleging Blake had discussed killing Bakley before she
gave birth to their daughter, Rose.</TE>
<TE>   According to a newly filed police statement, Blake learned in late
1999 that Bakley was pregnant, and told an unnamed private
investigator he wanted to force Bakley to have an abortion or "whack
her."</TE>
<TE>   Blake told the private investigator that "Bakley would not accept
money to go away," according to the seven-page declaration of Los
Angeles Police Det. Ronald Y. Ito, filed with the court Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several months, Ito said, Blake plotted to plant
illegal drugs on Bakley, then asked two stuntmen to kill her.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Nash scheduled a May 21 hearing on a prosecution motion
to recuse defense attorney Arna H. Zlotnik, who represents Blake's
bodyguard and co-defendant, Earle Caldwell. Zlotnik is being paid by
Blake, Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, best known for his leading role in the 1970s television
series "Baretta," is charged with murder with the special allegation
of lying in wait, two counts of soliciting murder and conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   He and Caldwell have each pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   Blake told police he left Bakley in his 1991 Dodge Stealth while
he returned to Vitello's restaurant, where they had dined, to
retrieve his gun. When he returned, he said, she had been shot.</TE>
<TE>   Braun has said that Blake disliked Bakley, but he said so did many
other men she had encountered in her mail-order business. She catered
to lonely men, sending them photos of naked women for money and bus
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles district attorney's office announced last week it
will not seek the death penalty against Blake. He still faces life in
prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Braun accused prosecutors of adding the
special circumstance of lying in wait "solely for the purpose of
keeping him in custody."</TE>
<TE>   Without that allegation, Blake would be facing 50 years to life in
prison and would be eligible for bail, Braun said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the hearing, prosecutors Patrick R. Dixon and Gregory A.
Dohi unveiled additional evidence against Blake and co-defendant
Caldwell. Caldwell, 46, of Burbank is charged with conspiracy. He was
released on bail last Friday after Blake posted $1 million in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Before their marriage, Bakley had accused Blake of stealing their
child, according to the police statement. Later, police say, Blake
told the FBI that Bakley was extorting him and selling pornography.</TE>
<TE>   Bakley gave birth to the child, now nearly 2, and after a
paternity test proved Blake was the father, he married Bakley and
moved her into a separate house on his Studio City property. In a
prenuptial agreement, "both parties agreed the party who canceled the
wedding would lose custody of the baby," the detective's declaration
says.</TE>
<TE>   Ito said records from an AT&amp;T prepaid phone card show calls were
made between March 12 and May 5, 2001, from Blake's house to the
homes of the two stuntmen he allegedly solicited to kill Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   According to Ito's declaration, Roy "Snuffy" Harrison arranged
separate meetings between Blake and two unidentified stuntmen at
Du-Par's restaurant in Studio City in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Braun has identified the two stuntmen as Gary McLarty, 61, of Lake
View Terrace, and Ronald "Duffy" Hambleton, 65, of Lucerne Valley,
but said he does not know which allegations involve each man. The
police declaration says the stuntmen told authorities that for each
meeting, Blake drove the man to his home and asked him to kill
Bakley. Blake asked the first stuntman to hide in Blake's van, which
would be parked in a desert area, and kill Bakley, the declaration
says. Blake told the stuntman that Caldwell already would have dug a
hole for burial, police say.</TE>
<TE>   The second stuntman told authorities Blake asked him "to kill
Bonny Lee Bakley as she sat in a parked car" near Bullhead City,
Ariz., or outside a local restaurant, the statement says. Blake
showed him "a small gun in a zippered case and suggested that the
person could use that gun to commit the murder," the declaration
states.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said Wednesday he has not seen any physical evidence linking
Blake to Bakley's shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Braun said Blake had no blood on his clothing, and disputed the
prosecutor's interpretation of a test that found gunshot residue on
Blake's hands and clothing. In court, Braun said such tests should
not be performed on people who have a gun in their possession, as
Blake did that night.</TE>
<TE>   The residue could have some from sources other than the murder
weapon, the coroner's report said. There were no fingerprints on the
weapon used in the slaying, a Walther P38 military 9 millimeter
handgun, a forensics report said.</TE>

<LD>In some parts of Hollywood, the seeds of secession aren't growing.
But like gardeners watchful of weeds, some local groups are working
to yank those seeds before they get a chance to sprout.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, as many as four homeowner groups along the
southern edge of the proposed city of Hollywood have petitioned the
agency overseeing secession issues to keep them out of any new city.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think we're fertile ground for secession," said Diana
Plotkin, president of Beverly/Wilshire Homeowners Assn. "The fact is,
people around here don't want to leave the city of Los Angeles."</LD>
<TE>   Leaders in three other groups, the Melrose Neighborhood Assn., the
Larchmont Village Neighborhood Assn. and the Hancock Park
Neighborhood Assn., agreed.</TE>
<TE>   They don't want to be part of Hollywood either.</TE>
<TE>   So, officials at the Local Agency Formation Commission, which
reviews incorporation proposals and decides whether to present them
to affected voters, have redrawn the proposed city's southern
boundary to exclude those four areas. But other homeowner and
business groups in the core of Hollywood, such as the Ivar Hill
Community Assn., seem more amenable to leaving Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, LAFCO staffers have set the proposed southern
boundary at Melrose Avenue, rejecting proposals that originally set
the boundary as far south as 3rd Street and as far west as San
Vicente and La Cienega boulevards. Those early proposals included the
Farmers Market, the Beverly Center and portions of the Fairfax
district.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, those landmarks aren't inside the proposed city. Even
without those major commercial centers, however, financial
projections by LAFCO officials indicate that the proposed city would
be economically viable.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO board will set the boundaries when it meets June 6 to
consider whether the Hollywood secession proposal should be placed on
the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   There are other unresolved boundary issues connected to the
secession of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   For example, there is the question of whether the Hollywood sign
would be in the new city.</TE>
<TE>   But for the moment, the talk about Hollywood's proposed boundaries
has centered on the desire of some homeowner groups to remain in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We have little in common with Hollywood," said Arturo Martinez,
president of the Melrose Neighborhood Assn., which represents 6,000
homes in an area surrounding the busy thoroughfare of the same name.</TE>
<TE>   "We have [the Los Angeles Police Department's] Wilshire Division,
not Hollywood Division," he said. "Our issues are different than
those in Hollywood. We're more residential in nature."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Chickie Byrne, a board member of the Hancock Park
Neighborhood Assn., which represents 1,200 area homes: "Hancock Park
has never been a part of Hollywood, and it will never be part of
Hollywood. It's absolutely ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhoods, with many well-appointed homes ranging in value
from $500,000 to more than $1 million, offer what residents said is a
unique sense of community difficult to find in sprawling Los Angeles.
What attracts many to that part of town is their location.</TE>
<TE>   "We're conveniently located to lots of places," said attorney
Vince Cox, president of the Larchmont Village Neighborhood Assn.
"It's close to Hollywood, Century City and downtown. We have a large
business village district; we have lots of schools nearby."</TE>
<TE>   In those precincts, they said the thought of leaving the city of
Los Angeles isn't appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very wary," Martinez said. "I just don't trust what's going
on."</TE>
<TE>   With recent City Charter reforms extending power to neighborhood
councils, it makes sense that these neighborhood organizations can
now wield influence over whether they want to be in the new Hollywood
city.</TE>
<TE>   It is something LAFCO officials haven't encountered much during
the spate of secession proposals now underway.</TE>
<TE>   Only in Hollywood have homeowners spoken out about whether they
want to be in the new city.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been no talk from boundaries [from homeowner
organizations] in the San Fernando Valley or the harbor area," said
Larry Calemine, LAFCO's executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Little attention was paid to the fledgling secession campaign in
and around Hollywood when Gene La Pietra, a nightclub owner and head
of the Hollywood group pushing secession, and others began to seek
signatures more than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Support for the new city, organizers said, seemed strong, judging
from the signatures gathered in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, one small area south of Melrose had one of our highest
concentrations of support," La Pietra said.</TE>
<TE>   Some homeowner association officials disagreed, saying La Pietra
and other secession supporters never approached some of the groups
that eventually wanted to opt out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a power grab," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who signed up early to support the idea of a separate
Hollywood municipality was Robert Mankiewicz, a semiretired
management consultant and a member of the Melrose association.</TE>
<TE>   "What could it hurt?" he remembered thinking as he signed a
petition at Trader Joe's.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he regrets the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "If I knew then what I know now," he said, "I never would have
signed that petition.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with this is," he said, "people suddenly came into
our area and announced that 'This is ours.' They never talked to us."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra rejected such comments, saying that secession leaders
did meet with several groups. He added that they had no objection if
a particular homeowners group wanted out of the proposed city.</TE>

<HD>2 Years, 2 Deaths, Few Tears Are Left</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Nine-year-old loses his life after he, two friends
handle a gun that fires. His mother was a drive-by shooting victim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JILL LEOVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people might be angry in Flora Burns' situation. Or vengeful. Or
distraught.</LD>
<LD>   But after her 9-year-old grandson died in an accidental shooting
Tuesday, less than two years after his mother--Burns' daughter--died
in a drive-by shooting, Burns was philosophical. "I can't blame
anyone," she said.</LD>
<LD>   The 52-year-old mother of eight had been the boy's guardian since
he was a baby, she said. On Wednesday, she hunched on her couch,
hands clasped, wearing slippers on her feet, a carelessly tied
bandana on her hair.</LD>
<TE>   She looked tired and did not always bother to rise when visitors
came to the door.</TE>
<TE>   But she was not crying. And if well-wishers dared to cry in her
presence, she admonished them brusquely:</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to hear that boo-hooing," she said. "You keep that
crying outside. You want to come in here, be happy."</TE>
<TE>   Burns' grandson, Levante Evans, 9, had been playing with two
9-year-old friends at a house near South Western Avenue and Century
Boulevard on Tuesday afternoon when the boys found a loaded gun in
the back bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   One of them pointed it at Levante's head and it accidentally
discharged, Burns and police said.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet hit Levante in the right eye, Burns said, showing with
her hand where the bullet entered.</TE>
<TE>   The boy who had been holding the gun then ran home to his mother,
who contacted Burns.</TE>
<TE>   The two women arrived at the scene just as an ambulance was
carrying Levante away. He was taken to King-Drew Medical Center,
where he was pronounced dead. His mother had also died there.</TE>
<TE>   Father of One Boy Is the Owner of the Gun</TE>
<TE>   The boy who accidentally shot the gun was still shaking and crying
hours after the fact, Burns said. The gun belonged to the father of
one of the boys. The man's name has not been released by police. He
was not home at the time of the shooting, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors will decide whether to file charges against him. Under
a recent state law, owners of firearms can be charged with negligence
if they fail to keep weapons secure from children.</TE>
<TE>   Burns, however, reacted with surprise when told the man may face
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Although she does not keep guns herself, she said she has no
anger. "I mean, it was an accident," she said. "I'm not blaming
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   She recounted how the owner of the gun called her early Wednesday
to comfort her. He was so upset about the accident, he could barely
speak, she said. Burns tried to comfort him.</TE>
<TE>   No one answered the door Wednesday at the home where the shooting
took place. Gail Shallowhorn, crime victims coordinator for the Los
Angeles city attorney's office, said that long-term counseling will
be offered to both boys involved. "They are considered victims," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   For Burns, a Mississippi native who took in Levante when most of
her children were nearly grown, the shooting was a reprise of her
daughter's slaying less than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mardess Brooks was 25 when she became the unintended victim of a
drive-by shooting. She was riding in the passenger seat of a
relative's car, Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   It takes Burns a moment to calculate the year of this shooting,
but she remembers the day without hesitation: "Nov. 22," she said,
"the day before Thanksgiving."</TE>
<TE>   Burns said friends and family marveled at her calmness then too.
Getting angry is just not her way, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Levante, however, handled his mother's death differently.</TE>
<TE>   Burns had been the chief parent figure in his life--he called her
"Mama-Granny," Burns said. But the boy was also close to his mother,
and after her death, he got into fights at school.</TE>
<TE>   For a while, "he had a whole lot of angry in him," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   But Levante's mood had improved recently, and lately he confided
in Burns, talking sometimes of his mother, she said. Burns let
Levante cry whenever he felt like it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Burns straightened up on the couch, animated for a moment as she
talked about how close they had become. Then she hunched. "I can't be
angry. I am just sorry," she said.</TE>

<HD>No Defense Tactic Can Hide This Ugly Software Scandal</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   One sure sign that a governor's staff is scared and cowering is
when it delays an important announcement until late on a Friday
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   This is straight out of every press secretary's tattered playbook,
under defense tactics: Wait until Capitol reporters have left for the
weekend--well past their deadlines--then release the embarrassing
news. Minimize the negative coverage.</LD>
<TE>   It seldom works, of course. Alarm bells go off. Annoyed reporters
and editors scramble and run the story. Then on Monday, they dig
deeper.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened late last Friday as Gov. Gray Davis' software
scandal continued to unfold. The governor announced the forced
resignation of General Services Director Barry Keene, a likable
former Senate leader.</TE>
<TE>   Davis mixed in some positive news, of sorts, designed to
illustrate his leadership: He asked Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer to launch
a criminal investigation. Actually, the AG already had done that.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also invited Lockyer's recommendations on how to
prevent a similar scandal in the future. In truth, both Davis and
former Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed bills that might have averted this
embarrassing, costly episode.</TE>
<TE>   The bills, by Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), would have extended
to computer technology purchases the same conflict-of-interest
safeguards that apply to other state contracting. A company that
helped develop bidding criteria could not itself bid on the contract.
Davis' 1999 veto message said this would "restrict needed
flexibility."</TE>
<TE>   Now Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) is pushing similar
legislation. And its prospects have suddenly improved.</TE>
<TE>   To back up, these are the sordid basics--mostly uncovered by state
Auditor Elaine M. Howle, but also by some newspapers, especially the
San Jose Mercury News:</TE>
<TE>   * The state signed a six-year, $95-million database software
contract with Oracle Corp. The pitch was volume discounts.
Oracle--and its reseller, Logicon Inc.--claimed the state would save
$16 million. But even using their assumptions, Howle found, the
volume deal will cost the state $41 million more than if it had never
happened.</TE>
<TE>   * The sellers contended the state would save $111 million, in all,
if it picked up an additional four-year option. To the contrary,
Howle said, it would mean a total extra state cost of $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   * Moreover, the assumptions are all wrong, the auditor reported.
The state agreed to purchase 270,000 software licenses. But that's
far more than the number of state employees, and tens of thousands
don't even use computers.</TE>
<TE>   * The Department of Information Technology, which initiated the
contract, surveyed 127 agencies and found only five that were
interested in the new software. Eleven months after the contract
signing, there still are no takers. DOIT never shared this
disinterest with other administration decision-makers.</TE>
<TE>   * Logicon was hired by the state as a consultant on the proposed
purchase. It developed data, projected savings and pitched the
contract. Turns out, Logicon stands to make $28 million in a side
deal with Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   * There's more: Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) is a friend
of DOIT Director Elias Cortez, and Polanco helped pitch the deal to
Finance Director Tim Gage. Polanco's son works for Oracle. As the
deal was cooking, the son attended a meeting of the state's software
advisory committee representing Oracle.</TE>
<TE>   * The proposal sailed smoothly into the governor's office, where
it was approved, in concept, by Cabinet Secretary Susan Kennedy after
being OKd by Keene, Gage and other administration honchos. Logicon
helped write the green-light memo, which asserted that "significant
benefits seem obvious." Approval was conditioned on further study by
the Finance Department.</TE>
<TE>   * But the contract was signed that day--last May 31--by Keene.
Gage says he thought there'd still be study time because the
agreement contained a 30-day escape clause. It did not. Indeed,
lawyers only had a few hours to review it. Oracle insisted this was a
now-or-never deal--a onetime offer that would disappear the next day
because it needed to impress Wall Street right then with a huge
contract.</TE>
<TE>   This is genuine scandal, not just Republican spin. Whether it's a
scandal involving criminality, we'll learn later. Already we know
it's a scandal of incompetence.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), chairman of the Joint Audit
Committee, is seeking permission from legislative leaders to conduct
a major investigation. So far, Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) is
reluctant.</TE>
<TE>   Davis should move fast and dump Director Cortez. Might as well
dump that entire, useless technology department.</TE>
<TE>   Announce it Friday or Monday, makes no difference. This scandal
cannot be minimized.</TE>

<HD>Differing Stories of Simi Valley Beating Offered</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Man said his wife and her daughter attacked him
with baseball bat as he fled a home fire, but they said it was
self-defense, detective testifies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Simi Valley man, allegedly beaten with a baseball bat by his wife
and her 19-year-old daughter, sustained severe cuts to his head and
was lucky to have survived the attack, a police investigator
testified Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The testimony came during the opening day of a preliminary hearing
for Eileen Shannon Childs, 37, who with her daughter, Jennifer, is
accused of setting fire to her husband's bedroom in March and then
attacking him as he tried to flee.</LD>
<LD>   The pair, dressed Wednesday in blue jail jumpsuits and sporting
matching blond ponytails, are charged with conspiracy to commit
murder, attempted murder and aggravated arson in the attack against
Larry Childs, 55.</LD>
<TE>   Eileen Childs also is accused of felony grand theft for allegedly
stealing $132,000 from her husband by forging his signature on an
insurance check.</TE>
<TE>   The mother and daughter have pleaded not guilty. According to
testimony Wednesday, they told police they were defending
themselves--Jennifer Childs with a baseball bat, Eileen Childs with a
beer mug--after Larry Childs grabbed them by the hair during the
chaos that ensued when the family's house caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   Eileen Childs also told police that she was hit in the nose during
the fight. According to testimony offered Wednesday, both women told
authorities that Larry Childs had not been violent before.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Lee, Simi
Valley Police Det. Jay Carrott testified that a doctor told him that
Larry Childs suffered "large and severe" lacerations to his skull
during the March 25 attack.</TE>
<TE>   Carrott recounted an interview with Larry Childs in which he
reported waking up in the smoke-filled master bedroom of the family's
Atherwood Avenue house.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Larry Childs tried to smother the fire, apparently
sparked by a candle that he said wasn't burning when he went to
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   When that didn't work, he reportedly ran through the house to
alert his family, Carrott said.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs said he eventually came face-to-face with Jennifer
Childs and at that instant was struck in the head by a baseball bat
wielded by Elaine Childs, Carrott testified.</TE>
<TE>   The investigator said Larry Childs told him that Jennifer Childs
joined the slugfest and that both women hit him 20 to 30 times while
screaming, "Why did you do it?"</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs told Carrott he had no idea what they were talking
about. Carrott said Elaine Childs later told him she and her daughter
had believed that Larry Childs had set the fire.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Childs grabbed both women by the hair to make them stop and
returned to the master bedroom to put out the fire. He told Carrott
he was attacked again while trying to leave the house.</TE>
<TE>   Carrott also offered evidence Wednesday of the family's financial
problems, testifying that Larry Childs told him that he had recently
discovered that he and his wife were deep in debt.</TE>
<TE>   According to Carrott, Larry Childs also was shocked to learn that

<HD>Beach Closure Is Reminder of 1999 Problems</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Huntington Beach shoreline area has been
off-limits since April 9. Officials worry that tourist season could
be affected again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The longest Orange County beach closure in three years has raised
fears of a repeat of the environmental problem that kept Huntington
Beach's shoreline off-limits through most of a summer.</LD>
<LD>   The beach was closed to swimmers and surfers April 9 after county
health officials noticed elevated levels of bacteria considered
harmful to humans, including coliform and Enterococcus. Initial
tests, however, were unable to pinpoint the source of the pollution.
Huntington State Beach was closed 1,000 feet in each direction of
Magnolia Street.</LD>
<LD>   That has raised the possibility of a repeat of the 1999 closure in
which several miles of beach were declared off-limits for two months
during the height of the tourist season because of high bacteria
levels whose source has never been found.</LD>
<TE>   "We still don't understand everything that's going on," said
Monica Mazur, a spokeswoman for the county's environmental health
division, which decides when beaches should be closed. "It's like an
onion. We're gradually peeling the layers away."</TE>
<TE>   Early tests, she said, ruled out beach bathrooms as the source of
the latest problem. An 84-inch sewer line paralleling the beach
appears sound. Tests of the water at various levels from the sand to
beyond the surf line, Mazur said, failed to determine a
cause.Although tests conducted last weekend indicated that some
bacteria levels at the site were beginning to subside, Mazur said,
officials will not consider reopening the beach until after further
tests May 11.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just trying to check out everything that could be in the
area," she said, "double-check it and then do some more sampling."</TE>
<TE>   After the 1999 beach closures, the county built a series of pumps
and waterways to divert about 90% of the county's urban runoff away
from the ocean and into the sewer system. Officials believe that
effort resulted in a 50% decrease in dangerous bacteria levels.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, researchers from several institutions spent $5.1
million to test the theory that much of the pollution resulted from a
massive plume of partially treated sewage pumped daily 4.2 miles off
shore but moved toward the surf zone by ocean tides.</TE>
<TE>   While preliminary results indicate that the tides are not sending
sewage back toward the shore, another study found the sewage plume
could have contributed to the 1999 beach closures.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook thinks the plume is the cause.
"We can't find any other source," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sanitation
District, said she would wait until the final data is in. "We want so
badly for this situation to be solved," she said.</TE>

<HD>Condor Is Free to Roam After 15 Years in Protective Custody</HD>
<DH>Conservation: Known as AC9, the bird was the last of his
species to be captured in the wild. Scientists hope his experience
will rub off on young birds.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Against a majestic panorama of plunging valleys and knife-edged
mountains, the last California condor captured in the wild spread his
9-foot wings and soared off a remote cliff in Los Padres National
Forest on Wednesday, 15 years after being trapped as part of an
ambitious plan to save the species from extinction.</LD>
<LD>   The 22-year-old bird, known as AC9 or Adult Condor 9, initially
had problems getting out of the cage holding him and three juvenile
condors. The younger birds made it look easy, flying out and over the
cliff-face and thrilling the more than 100 observers on a nearby
ridge. But two hours later AC9 remained baffled, so biologists shoved
him out the door.</LD>
<LD>   In moments, the enormous bird was airborne over his home
territory. He sped along the cliffs some 4,000 feet above the green,
undulating floor of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary just north of the town
of Fillmore. Other condors wheeled and glided nearby, casting black
silhouettes against the sun.</LD>
<TE>   "This is the biggest release we have had and the most meaningful,"
said Bruce Palmer, who coordinates the $35-million condor program for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "We've come full circle. We've
turned the corner in reintroducing these animals to the wild."</TE>
<TE>   With AC9's release, there are now a total of 68 California condors
in the wild, split among Los Padres National Forest, Big Sur and the
Grand Canyon. Another 16 are in field pens and 113 remain in
captivity.</TE>
<TE>   For many, the release was an emotional moment, one symbolizing
both the success of the condor program and the dangers awaiting North
America's largest birds as they face a world fraught with increasing
danger.</TE>
<TE>   John Borneman, who once worked for the National Audubon Society,
recalled his mixed feelings when AC9 was taken.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was captured in the wild--the last bird--I closed the
door to my office and cried," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The condor captive breeding program began in 1985. With extinction
imminent, condors were taken from the wild, bred in captivity and,
starting in 1992, released back into nature.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to develop condor populations of 150 or
more--including 15 breeding pairs--in California and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   But as the birds are reintroduced to the wild they face new
threats. Condors have died from eating bullets, they have been
electrocuted on power lines and they have killed their chicks because
they lack parenting skills. Last week an adult male condor dipped his
head in oil, came back to the nest and smudged his chick. Scientists
were initially concerned, but now say neither animal has oil on it.</TE>
<TE>   "AC9 will be less likely to get into trouble in the wild because
he's been there," predicted Mike Clark, who has taken care of the
condor for 13 years as a keeper at the Los Angeles Zoo. "He's a
solid, robust dominant male."</TE>
<TE>   Biologists hope the bird will be a mentor and role model for the
highly imitative, captive-bred condors who have grown up without
parents and need to learn crucial survival skills.</TE>
<TE>   "He's out here for a job," said Mike Wallace, who heads the Condor
Recovery Team from his base at the San Diego Zoo. "Young birds follow
the adults."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the first condor egg laid and brooded in the wild in 18
years hatched in Los Padres National Forest. Two other condor nests
have been found in the area. Both have eggs and one could hatch
within two weeks, biologists said.</TE>

meet and rekindle their old romance, producing a chick. Last year,
AC8 was freed near the spot where AC9 was released.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those who drove up the steep mountain road and then hiked
out to watch the release have long histories with condors.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Hamber, 72, a condor biologist, spotted AC9 one day before his
capture while he was feeding on a carcass.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he would come back the next day," said Hamber, who runs
the Condor Information System at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural
History. "I reluctantly called the Fish and Wildlife people. Even
though I knew he had to be caught, I didn't want to see him trapped.
It's incredible that he's back out. It's a wonderful feeling."</TE>
<TE>   As AC9 was about to leave the pen, Adelina Alva-Padilla, spiritual
leader of the Santa Ynez Valley Chumash Indians, blessed the release.</TE>
<TE>   She has attended three condor releases, wearing a red headband and
carrying a staff covered with carved bears and turtles.</TE>
<TE>   "So many things on Earth are diminishing," she said. "The waters
and rivers are drying up and even the seasons are changing. So I pray
for his safety, for him to do well and for him to survive."</TE>

<HD>Suit Aims to Void Electrical Contracts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>All of California's long-term electricity contracts should be
overturned because a key negotiator for the state had a personal
conflict of interest, according to a state senator and a conservative
legal foundation that filed a lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles County
Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) and the U.S. Justice
Foundation allege that the state's contracts are void because state
negotiator Vikram Budhraja was on the payroll of Edison
International--the parent company of Southern California Edison--at
the same time he was working as an energy consultant for the state.</LD>
<LD>   "His interests are harmful to the public," states the lawsuit,
which asks a judge to immediately suspend the contracts.</LD>
<TE>   Last spring, the state Department of Water Resources signed dozens
of deals worth $43 billion to help supply electricity to the
customers of financially hobbled utilities. Eight contracts have
since expired and another eight have been renegotiated.</TE>
<TE>   Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo warned Wednesday that a
victory by McClintock in court would "return us to the brink of
blackouts."</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what you think about [the contracts]," Hidalgo said,
"they keep the lights on."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, he said, Budhraja has recused himself from dealing
directly with Edison. He did not help negotiate the state's long-term
power contract with Edison subsidiary Mission Energy, Hidalgo said.</TE>
<TE>   But McClintock, who is running for state controller against
Democrat Steve Westley, calls Budhraja's conflict "self-evident,"
given that the water department signed long-term contracts in order
to supply power to Edison. Customers of Edison, PG&amp;E and San Diego
Gas &amp; Electric are expected to pay the full cost of the contracts.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that Budhraja violated a statute that
prohibits state employees from being financially interested in any
contract made by them or by a body or board of which they are a
member. Courts have ruled that contracts made in violation of that
law are void.</TE>
<TE>   What isn't clear but will be learned through the lawsuit,
McClintock said, is whether the $100,000 or more that Budhraja
received last year from Edison amounts to 5% or more of his annual
income. State law uses such a threshold to define whether an employee
has a financial interest in a contract.</TE>
<TE>   Once a senior vice president at Southern California Edison,
Budhraja left the utility in January 2000 to create a Pasadena
consulting firm called Electric Power Group. In January 2001, the
state hired Budhraja's company for $6.2 million to help it respond to
the electricity crisis. As a state consultant, Budhraja was required
to disclose his economic interests. Paperwork he filed in late March
shows that he was paid at least $100,000 by Edison in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Both Budhraja and Edison officials said that he did no work for
the money. Instead, it was an annual retainer that preserves Edison's
right to call upon his services. The retainer was renewed this year,
Edison officials said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Moorpark College's No. 2 administrator, a veteran educator with a
reputation as a consensus-builder and strong student advocate, was
tapped Wednesday to become the institution's next president.</LD>
<LD>   Eva Conrad, executive vice president since 1997, was selected for
the $138,744-a-year position over one other finalist, Vicky Smith, a
Cornell University program director.</LD>
<LD>   College district Chancellor Phillip Westin offered the job to
Conrad, 56, after interviewing the two candidates and observing them
at an on-campus forum held Monday. Westin said Conrad's status as an
inside candidate gave her the edge.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought the nod should go to Eva, because we already know Eva.
She's here, she already knows the people on campus and she can land
with her feet running," Westin said.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad succeeds James Walker, who retires June 30 after 10 years
as president. People involved in the nationwide search, which began
last fall and drew more than 50 applicants, said they wanted Westin
to select someone who would continue Walker's style of open,
team-oriented leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Norman Nagel, president of the Ventura County Community College
District Board of Trustees, said Conrad fits that bill. "She is the
right person in the right place at the right time to take Moorpark
... and move it forward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bergstrom, Moorpark's student body president, agreed that
Conrad, who holds a PhD in psychology, was a wise choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Because she has worked at the school, she knows the vision that
Dr. Walker has had and she can pick up the ball and carry it,"
Bergstrom said. "The college, generally speaking, was definitely for
her. She was the local favorite."</TE>
<TE>   Bergstrom described Conrad as a caring and committed manager who
values the opinions of students. Conrad's commitment to Moorpark is
evident in her frequent attendance at student-run events, Bergstrom
said, and in her and her husband's decision to endow a scholarship
for student government leaders in honor of their son, Steve Rafter,
who was killed in December 2000 in an automobile accident at the age
of 17.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad will be assuming office at a pivotal point in the history
of the community college, Ventura County's largest in terms of
enrollment and most highly regarded in terms of graduation and
university transfer rates. The 14,538-student campus is close to
capacity and continues to face enrollment increases. And though
recent passage of a districtwide bond measure will help finance
projects to ease overcrowding, Conrad will need to ensure that the
college runs smoothly as it grows.</TE>
<TE>   According to Westin, Conrad's familiarity with upcoming
projects--including building satellite campuses in Conejo Valley and
Simi Valley--makes her well-suited to that task. "Everything that is
in the planning, she has been part of," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad received her doctorate and master's degrees in psychology
from the University of Arizona and a bachelor's degree in psychology
from the University of South Alabama. She spent 22 years as a
professor and administrator at San Bernardino Valley College before
coming to Ventura County in 1997. As Moorpark's executive vice
president, she has overseen academic affairs and student services
such as counseling, financial aid and admissions. In February, she
was awarded a Leadership Award for Administrative Excellence from the
Assn. of California Community College Administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad, a Westlake Village resident, said she was thrilled by her
selection. "I've done nothing but walk around and hug people since I
got here" Wednesday, she said.</TE>

<HD>Convention Bureau Called to Explain Bookings, Bonuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of a city panel on Wednesday called for reform of the way the
Los Angeles convention bureau books major events and pays bonuses to
its sales staff and executives.</LD>
<LD>   The changes were proposed by members of the city Convention Center
Commission as City Controller Laura Chick announced she is auditing
the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.</LD>
<LD>   The bureau, which is a nonprofit corporation independent of city
government, books events at the convention center and promotes
tourism for Los Angeles under a city contract that has paid it up to
$17.5 million in city hotel tax money annually.</LD>
<TE>   The city commission held a sometimes contentious, nearly
three-hour meeting Wednesday with bureau President George Kirkland,
demanding an explanation of the cancellation of 42 conventions in the
last three years.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland told the panel that the lack of hotels near the
convention center has played a major role in the high cancellation
rate, and is partly responsible for the low number of new bookings
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest challenge is our hotel inventory being sufficient
enough," Kirkland said.</TE>
<TE>   But commissioners questioned whether Kirkland's bureau has
adjusted its marketing plan to address the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I was highly disappointed they did not have a new marketing
strategy," said commission President Peter Zen, owner of Westin
Bonaventure Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Zen ended the meeting telling Kirkland they should meet again "to
discuss your marketing strategy when you have one."</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland said the bureau has been studying 30 competing bureaus to
see if there are ways to win back business, and his sales staff has
logged thousands of additional calls to potential clients to drum up
new sales leads.</TE>
<TE>   Zen and commission Vice President Lesa Slaughter said they are
concerned that the bureau pays bonuses to its salespeople and
executives if a convention organizer signs a nonbinding letter saying
his company or group plans to hold an event in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They cited a report in The Times that $225,000 in bonuses were
paid during one two-year period, despite later cancellation of 20 of
the conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland told the commission that although sales personnel do not
pay back bonuses if conventions later cancel, the lost bookings are
counted against incentive goals for future years.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter and Zen said bureau practices and policies should be
changed to require convention organizers to sign a legally binding
commitment to the city or its hotels before a convention is
considered "definite" for purposes of paying bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely think that there is room for change," said
Slaughter, who was chief of staff to former Mayor Richard Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau Chairman Alan I. Rothenberg defended the way the bureau
designates a convention booking as "definite," saying it is standard
in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Chick said her audit, requested by Mayor James K. Hahn,
will determine whether city funds given to the bureau are being
properly spent and yielding good results.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see how they measure up with performance," she said.
"We want to look at the city's monetary contribution and determine
whether it is being used in conformance with the contract."</TE>
<TE>   Chick said the audit also will examine the method for determining
bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be interested to understand why aren't the bonuses paid after
the convention takes place," she said. "I think there is room for
improvement. They have taken some steps, but the audit is going to
take a look at whether they have gone far enough."</TE>

<HD>Major Cuts in County Health Care Foreseen</HD>
<DH>Finances: Officials may propose eliminating thousands of
jobs and converting two hospitals into clinics to cope with the
budget deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials will recommend "draconian" cuts
next month, possibly including thousands of job cuts and conversion
of two of its six public hospitals into clinics, officials said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The proposals are intended to narrow a budget deficit that is
expected to reach $688 million in three years. Though the details are
in flux, officials are considering proposals to convert High Desert
Hospital in the Antelope Valley and possibly one more hospital into
outpatient facilities. Another option is moving Rancho Los Amigos
Medical Center, a rehabilitation center in Downey, out from under the
county Department of Health Services so that it would become
self-supporting. Cutbacks at other hospitals are likely.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, director of the health services department,
said Wednesday that several thousand jobs would be cut if the county
cannot get more federal money.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't see any way around it unless there were a massive
infusion of funds," he said. "The money's got to come from
somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said the cuts are likely to be
"draconian."</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who has a stake in this health system is going to get
their toes stepped on," he told a group of health-care professionals
Wednesday, "so get your Dr. Scholl's. It's not going to be without
pain."</TE>
<TE>   Dwindling federal assistance means that the health department will
run a $360-million deficit by next year. Supervisors plan to fly to
Washington next week to urge the Bush administration to give them
access to more money, but they are not optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   After the supervisors return, Garthwaite is scheduled to present
them with a proposal for cuts to close the deficit. The reductions
could be approved by October.</TE>
<TE>   A political storm is brewing. "We believe that the public is not
going to sit by idly while this health system is dismantled," said
Bart Diener, assistant general manager of Service Employees
International Union Local 660, the union that represents most of the
health department's 22,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Diener acknowledged that Garthwaite needs to plan for dire cuts,
but said supervisors should focus on finding new money to keep the
system afloat. "There's too much of an effort to say they're tough
enough to make the cuts and not enough courage to demand what the
patients require," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Melinda Paras, the former president of Alameda County's public
health authority and now the executive director of the consumer group
Health Access, said her organization will fight closure of any
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Removing that last resort for the delivery of health care, I find
really frightening," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kathryn Barger, the chief of staff for Supervisor Mike Antonovich,
whose district includes High Desert Hospital, said the supervisor was
not flatly opposed to cuts there. But she warned that any reductions
must be accompanied by plans to ensure that residents of the remote
Antelope Valley have access to health care.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to make sure it's not compromising the quality ... of
care," she said.</TE>
<TE>   After Garthwaite's predecessor, Mark Finucane, proposed closing
High Desert last year, Antonovich publicly scolded him for not
recommending anything to fill the void. Not long afterward, the
supervisors pushed Finucane out of his job.</TE>
<TE>   But in December, already facing a massive deficit, supervisors
voted to study building an emergency room in High Desert Hospital and
expanding the emergency room at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, another
hospital that may be downsized.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County's health department has been financially
teetering for a decade, largely because the region is home to nearly
3 million uninsured people who rely heavily on county facilities.
Making matters worse, federal and state governments have steadily
pared funding for public hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors have hesitated to substantially cut health
services. The county went to the brink of bankruptcy in 1995 before
securing a $1-billion bailout from the Clinton administration. The
White House renewed that bailout in 2000, but the amount of money
coming to Los Angeles decreases each year until 2005, when it
vanishes.</TE>
<TE>   After each bailout, supervisors vowed to make deep cuts but made
only relatively small trims. They often blamed weak managers and
union pressure. But supervisors were reluctant to cut medical
services in their own districts--especially politically popular but
costly hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   After securing the latest bailout in June 2000, supervisors
pledged to avoid the hasty, scrambled budget-cutting that led to
thousands of abrupt layoffs in 1995. But it was not until January of
this year that they made their first trims, saving about $13.5
million through internal restructuring and closing five clinics--one
in each supervisor's district. All other cuts were deferred until
Garthwaite, hired in December from the Veterans Administration in
Washington, arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the financial picture, some officials, including
Antonovich and Garthwaite, believe that the health department needs
major restructuring. "There are things that need to be done whether
we get a bailout or not," said Antonovich chief of staff Barger.</TE>
<TE>   Garthwaite said the six county hospitals are not linked to a
common computer network and many offer services that could be
centralized. Critics attribute that to the supervisors treating each
hospital as their own turf rather than as part of a countywide
network.</TE>
<TE>   Health experts said the supervisors must put politics aside in
planning the cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "If political issues drive these decisions, it will potentially
have a detrimental effect on the health-care fabric of the entire
area," said Dr. Michael Karpf, vice provost for hospital systems at
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's the best medical decisions, we'll just have to learn how
to live with them and adapt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Lott, executive vice president of the Hospital Assn. of
Southern California, said the loss of any county-operated hospitals
would be devastating.</TE>
<TE>   The county hospitals now provide 50% of the emergency-room care in
the county, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Any loss would have to be made up by private hospitals, which
already divert ambulances regularly because of overcrowded emergency
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It will begin to have a domino effect throughout the system,"
Lott said. "Ambulances will be scrambling more and more."</TE>
<TE>   But Lott said private hospitals realize that there really isn't
any choice given the dramatic deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that can prevent this is an infusion of dollars,
and we can't see where it's coming from," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly don't see the state with its current financial
problems being able to do anything for the county, and we don't
believe that the federal government will come to the rescue a third
time," he said.</TE>

<HD>Charges Won't Be Filed in Brush Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>No criminal charges will be filed against two ranch workers in the
Feb. 10 brush fire in Fallbrook that destroyed 45 homes and burned
5,700 acres, Dist. Atty. Paul Pfingst said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Pfingst said that several days before the fire Francisco Rueda and
Luiz Rueda had been issued a North County Fire District permit to
burn leaves, grass and brush on Feb. 8. The two did not clear a
sufficient area around the fire, as required by the permit, before
dousing the flames and quitting work, Pfingst said.</LD>
<LD>   Two days later an unusually strong, hot wind swept through the
rural area and ignited the embers, Pfingst said in a letter to the
state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</LD>
<TE>   "Under these conditions it is unlikely that having a cleared area
of 30 feet would have made much difference," Pfingst wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The fire raced through avocado groves and million-dollar homes. It
took hundreds of firefighters nearly two days to extinguish the
blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Pfingst wrote that although it is unlikely that a jury would
convict the Ruedas of a crime, "it is possible that there may be
civil liability on their part, which requires a lower standard of
proof."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor said the Ruedas insisted that they checked with the
fire district on Feb. 8 and were given permission to use their
permit.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials said they have no record of such a contact and that
Feb. 8 had been declared a "no-burn" day because of low humidity and
high heat.</TE>

<HD>Suspect Named in Slaying of Sheriff's Deputy</HD>
<DH>Crime: Baca says the gunman, identified as an illegal
immigrant, might have fled to Mexico.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County sheriff's officials on Wednesday named a suspect
in the shooting death of a sheriff's deputy Monday: Jorge "Armando"
Arroyo Garcia, a 25-year-old illegal immigrant and suspected drug dealer
who may have fled back to Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday afternoon, Baldwin Park police found the 1989 Nissan
Maxima that Garcia drove when he allegedly killed Deputy David March,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The car was found on the 14100 block of Chilcot Street near
Baldwin Park Boulevard, said sheriff's Sgt. Joe Mileham. Homicide
detectives and bloodhounds will scour the car for potential evidence.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff Lee Baca released photos of the suspect taken from a video
provided to the Sheriff's Department by someone who knew Garcia. He
did not say how investigators fixed on Garcia as their prime suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Ray Peavy, a top homicide investigator, said they are
confident they have named the right man--"and when we capture him, it
will be clear this is the case."</TE>
<TE>   The suspect is believed to be 5 feet 10 to 6 feet tall, weighing
about 230 pounds, with short black hair combed back, a dark
complexion and, at the time of the shooting, a mustache and chin
whiskers.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who is considered armed and dangerous, has used "Daniel,"
"Chato" and other aliases while manufacturing and selling
amphetamines, Baca said. The sheriff said Garcia has a criminal
record going back to his youth.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia is also wanted by the Baldwin Park Police Department in
connection with two attempted murders since November for allegedly
shooting at houses. The suspect, who authorities said has generally
been active in the San Gabriel Valley, also is wanted by El Monte
police on weapons charges.</TE>
<TE>   According to information reaching investigators, Baca said, Garcia
had told friends that he was determined not to be taken alive and
would shoot the first officer to stop him.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy David March, 33, was shot after stopping a driver on Live
Oak Avenue just east of Peck Road in Irwindale, Baca and Peavy said.</TE>
<TE>   Within a minute of the stop, the deputy was fatally wounded by
shots fired from a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, Baca said. March was
unable to return fire.</TE>
<TE>   Peavy said one man was taken into custody after the shooting, but
later was determined not to have been involved. He is still being
held on unrelated warrants.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to initial reports, investigators now believe Garcia was
alone at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Baca said he fears Garcia has returned to Mexico, and Mexican
authorities are cooperating in the search for him. He said the FBI
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service are also helping in
the search.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral services for March are set for 2 p.m. Saturday at Grace
Baptist Church Amphitheatre, 22833 Copper Hill Drive in Saugus. A
graveside ceremony will follow at Eternal Valley Memorial Park and
Mortuary, 23287 N. Sierra Highway in Newhall.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial fund has been set up for March's family. Donations may
be mailed to Sheriff's Relief Fund No. 257 in care of the Sheriff's
Relief Assn., 11515 S. Colima Road, Whittier, CA 90604.</TE>

<HD>Embezzling Suspect Disappears</HD>

<LD>The former business director of Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van
Nuys has been charged with embezzling $748,564 over the last two
years, but authorities said Wednesday she is nowhere to be found.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors charged Svetlana Bashkinov, 34, last month with one
count of grand theft of more than $150,000, and she posted $20,000
bail. But the Pacific Palisades resident became the subject of a
police search when she failed to show up for arraignment Monday at
Van Nuys Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill Ryder said Bashkinov submitted requests
for refund checks from the hospital, then deposited the checks in
credit union and bank accounts in her name and used some of the money
to pay off her credit cards.</LD>
<TE>   Bashkinov began taking the money about two weeks after she was
hired in May 2000, Ryder said.</TE>
<TE>   Bashkinov's attorney, Keith Davidson, said his client did appear
in court Monday morning, but she left when the arraignment was
continued until the afternoon and never returned.</TE>
<TE>   He said Wednesday that he did not know where she was.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials said Bashkinov was responsible for the business
office, as well as admissions and registration, which gave her access
to $90 million in annual net revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're responsible for billing and collection, a lot of
money is passing through your hands," said Hal Wurtzel, the
hospital's vice president for corporate development.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we were shocked. To the best of my knowledge, she
seemed to be a good worker and well liked," Wurtzel said.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit community hospital has taken steps to correct the
accounting problems that led to the alleged theft, and hospital
attorneys have filed a civil suit against Bashkinov in Superior
Court.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital also sought and received a Superior Court order last
month to freeze Bashkinov's personal accounts, which allegedly
contained a third of the stolen hospital funds, authorities said.
Insurance will cover the difference, officials said.</TE>

<HD>Latinos Threaten Lawsuit Against Valley Secession</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worried that Latinos could lose political clout in a new San Fernando
Valley city, an advocacy group Wednesday said it will pursue a
voting-rights lawsuit against the region's secession plan unless
proposed council districts are redrawn.</LD>
<LD>   Under the map prepared by the state commission studying secession,
Latinos would comprise a majority of the population in five of 14
council districts in a Valley city. They also would be the biggest
ethnic group in four other districts.</LD>
<LD>   But Alan Clayton of the California Latino Redistricting Coalition
told the Local Agency Formation Commission that the crucial test is
voter registration, not population.</LD>
<TE>   Clayton contends that LAFCO's map violates the U.S. Voting Rights
Act by concentrating Latino voters in two northeast Valley districts.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe you have two districts that can elect a Latino
representative, one district that is questionable, and that's it,"
Clayton said. "Your map disenfranchises the Latino community."</TE>
<TE>   As a remedy, Clayton and others suggested a slight revision in the
map to more evenly distribute Latino voters across the districts,
creating at least three council seats that Latinos would likely win.</TE>
<TE>   If the changes are not made, Clayton warned the commissioners, his
group will petition the U.S. Justice Department to file a lawsuit
against the districting plan.</TE>
<TE>   Such a suit would seek a court order imposing the changes sought
by the redistricting coalition, which has not taken a stand on
secession itself.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Brain, president of the secession group Valley VOTE, urged
LAFCO board members to make the revisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you put everything we've done at risk over this issue?"
Brain asked. "This is such a minor issue."</TE>
<TE>   Several LAFCO members, including Los Angeles Councilwoman Cindy
Miscikowski and county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, promised to review
the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, LAFCO warned that it was falling behind schedule as new
material streams in from various camps in the secession debates.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Calemine, LAFCO's executive officer, said the nine-member
board will vote May 22--a week later than originally scheduled--on
whether to put Valley secession on the November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO also is considering secession proposals for Hollywood and
the harbor area.</TE>
<TE>   The commission plans to release its final report on the harbor's
financial viability as a city later this week, with its Hollywood
analysis to follow.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionists again took the podium Wednesday to address
what they called "the defining issue" of their movement: the
45-foot-high Hollywood sign.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists and the city of Los Angeles are battling over which
municipality would own the 1923 landmark if Hollywood wins cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It has become very emotional," said Gene La Pietra, a Hollywood
nightclub owner leading the breakaway campaign.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce maintains the
sign.</TE>
<TE>   "That sign belongs to Hollywood," La Pietra said. "The other day
one of its letters got loose and it was repaired within 24 hours.
That's what happens in a small community."</TE>

<HD>A-J Levinson, 73; Helped Pioneer Living Wills and Patient
Rights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A-J Levinson, who led a New York-based patients' rights group that
developed the now-common living will and served as a national
spokeswoman for bringing dignity to dying, has died. She was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Levinson died of cancer Monday at her home in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   As executive director of Concern for Dying from 1976 to 1987,
Levinson urged family members, doctors, nurses and other caregivers
to honor a dying person's wishes.</LD>
<TE>   The now-defunct Concern for Dying, which grew out of the
Euthanasia Educational Council, was founded in 1967. Levinson, who
had been on the board, became executive director the same year that
the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in the nation's first major
right-to-die case that the parents of Karen Ann Quinlan had the right
to remove her from life support. Their daughter was 21 when she
slipped into a coma at a party in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   The Quinlan case propelled bioethics into the American
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Concern for Dying distributed more than 7 million copies of the
living will, a document that individuals sign while competent to
express their wishes not to have their lives prolonged through the
use of artificial or heroic means if there is no hope of recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "The important point," Levinson told television newsman Robert
MacNeil in 1985, "is that it is most helpful to family members as
well as physicians if they have a clear indication of what the
patients would have wanted. Because the decision has to be made, or
should be made, rightfully, on the basis of that patient's feelings
and directions."</TE>
<TE>   Levinson and her organization also stressed the need for dying
patients to have sufficient pain medication. Levinson, however,
denounced mercy killing.</TE>
<TE>   There are, she told The Times in 1986, moral and practical reasons
to oppose a law allowing mercy killing. Such a law, she said, would
have enormous potential for abuse and the category of those eligible
for euthanasia inevitably would grow to include questionable cases.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think society should be in the business of killing
people," she said. "If society were to do a better job of treating
pain and treating the suffering of terminal illness, we wouldn't have
patients saying, 'Kill me.'"</TE>
<TE>   Born Ann Jane Rock in Boston in 1929, Levinson (she preferred to
go by the hyphenated A-J) was the daughter of a mother who drove an
ambulance during World War I and a father, Dr. John Rock, who taught
at Harvard Medical School and helped develop the first birth control
pill.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Bryn Mawr with a degree in history, she
worked briefly for the Central Intelligence Agency. She did graduate
work in psychology and sociology at Columbia in 1957 and later taught
in private schools in Manhattan, where she introduced courses on sex
education and drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Levinson's son, Paul, said his mother was motivated in her crusade
to bring dignity to dying as a result of the death of her 19-year-old
brother in 1946. An auto accident victim, he died several days after
going into a coma.</TE>
<TE>   "Families were routinely denied the right to make decisions on
behalf of loved ones who could not make the decision for themselves,"
Paul Levinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the kernel of the interest in my mother's life," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It grew into her willingness to serve on the [Concern for Dying]
board in the late '60s and changed her career from one of
schoolteacher and administrator to an advocate for social change," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Levinson said his mother was aware of the impact she--and
others--had made. But she always stressed that it was a collaborative
effort, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things she was proudest of was putting together groups
that worked collaboratively in a consistent way to educate lawyers,
doctors, nurses, clergy, etc., about the work that the organization
was doing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "For all intents, the work of Concern for Dying was successful
because the living will and/or advanced directives are legal
documents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Levinson retired in 1988, a year after she suffered a debilitating
stroke.</TE>
<TE>   A 1990 merger of the Society for the Right to Die and Concern for
Dying created a new organization called Choice in Dying. Choice in
Dying has since become Partnership in Caring.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her son, Levinson is survived by her husband, Henry
W. Levinson; two daughters, Martha Levinson and Kate Ewing, both of
Manhattan; and a sister, Rachel Achenbach of Boxford, Mass.</TE>

<HD>Kidnap Suspect Fled to Mexico, Authorities Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Convicted abuser abducted ex-girlfriend and their
two children, sheriff's detectives say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A convicted spousal abuser who allegedly kidnapped his ex-girlfriend
and two children from a Lomita home in March is believed to have fled
with them to Mexico, authorities said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Jose Delacruz's 19-year-old son Alejo, who authorities said helped
in the suspected kidnapping, was arrested March 28 in Bakersfield. He
told Los Angeles sheriff's detectives that Delacruz, 39; Delacruz's
ex-girlfriend Adriana Galindo, 27; and their daughters, Gypsy, 3, and
Ariane,1, were no longer in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "The arrest confirmed that [Jose Delacruz] was down in Mexico, and
that he left sooner than we expected. Based on what we were told, he
fled almost immediately after the abduction," said sheriff's Sgt.
Stan Baillif.</LD>
<TE>   Alejo Delacruz faces three counts of kidnapping and burglary and
is being held on $1-million bail, Baillif said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Jose Delacruz, his son and another man took
Galindo and the girls from an aunt's home in Lomita on March 6, a day
after he was convicted for beating Galindo.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities found the Chevrolet Suburban used in the alleged
abduction a day later in Mission Hills, near a relative's house.</TE>
<TE>   Galindo's aunt and other relatives recounted several attempts by
Galindo to leave Delacruz. According to aunt Silvia Martinez, Galindo
told her that a battered women's shelter had arranged for her and her
children to relocate to Chicago last fall, but that they turned back
when they reached Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   "She was terrified of him," Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Delacruz probably fled to the Mexican state of
Zacatecas, where he has family. They have asked Mexican authorities
for help finding him, Galindo and their daughters.</TE>
<TE>   "He has enough family there that we can't say for sure where he
is," Baillif said.</TE>
<TE>   Baillif said relatives of Delacruz in Los Angeles have said that
he, Galindo and the children are OK. But authorities have no
information to confirm or discredit that at this point, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to verify at least that they're safe," Baillif said. "If
something happened to her, God forbid, we want to know about that,
because that changes a great deal the way we'll deal with this," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information on this case is asked to call the Los
Angeles Sheriff's Department at (310) 539-1661.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Airport May Add Flights Despite Noise Limits</HD>
<DH>Aviation: American Airlines, which starts new routes in
June, seeks permanent slots and says facility's exclusive pact with
JetBlue violates law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from American Airlines and others, Long Beach Airport
officials have agreed to consider increasing the number of flights
allowed at the freeway-adjacent facility to accommodate requests by
carriers to start service there.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this year, American Airlines requested four permanent
daily "slots" at the airport for flights to New York and Chicago. The
company started selling tickets for these flights in March--even
before officials agreed to make room for the extra planes. American
will start flying these routes June 15 using temporary slots.</LD>
<LD>   The airline, which has threatened to sue if it does not receive
permanent slots, asserted in a paper submitted to the city this week
that the airport's agreement to provide JetBlue with exclusive
two-year use of 27 slots violates federal and state law. Nineteen
slots are currently in use at the airport, with the others held for
flights to be added later.</LD>
<TE>   Space at the 79-year-old facility is scarce because of a noise
compatibility ordinance that limits the number of commercial takeoffs
to 41 per day. But this number could grow because today's aircraft
are quieter and the types of aircraft that use the airport have
changed since noise restrictions were devised 13 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure on all of Southern California's airports to expand is
intense, and was made more so last month by the U.S. Navy's decision
to turn over the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to Irvine,
which intends to develop the area for housing and parks, among other
things.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there the possibility we could fly some additional flights and
still stay within our noise budget?" asked Sharon Diggs-Jackson, the
facility's public affairs officer. "Yes. But when we make the change
and how many flights we add would need to be determined."</TE>
<TE>   The city is reviewing whether it should take a noise measurement
now based on traffic projections provided by airlines that use the
airport, or wait until it reaches the 41-flight limit and then
determine the actual noise levels.</TE>
<TE>   The airport's manager, Chris Kunze, is considering increasing the
number of flights at the airport as part of an appeals process
requested by American--which currently offers four daily flights from
Long Beach to Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   American demanded an administrative hearing after the city said it
could offer only temporary slots, which would expire in four months.
Alaska Airlines, which requested three slots to start service to
Seattle in September, has also requested a hearing.</TE>
<TE>   The American appeals process began Monday when the carrier met
with Long Beach officials and gave them a document in which it
alleges that the airport's exclusive agreement with JetBlue puts
other carriers at a competitive disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   Kunze has 10 business days to render a decision. If American is
not satisfied with his response, the carrier can appeal to Long Beach
City Manager Henry Taboada.</TE>
<TE>   In the document, American alleges that the JetBlue "agreement was
shrouded in secrecy, and at JetBlue's insistence not offered to any
other carrier. The city simply acquiesced to JetBlue's desire to
freeze out all competition."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday at Long Beach Airport, JetBlue Chief
Executive David Neeleman was emphatic that his company--known for low
fares and its blue and white Airbus A320s with leather seats and
satellite TV monitors--will use all of its slots.</TE>
<TE>   "There's absolutely no doubt in our minds that we will have 27
daily flights out of here by next May," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neeleman traveled to the Long Beach Airport on Wednesday to
inaugurate two daily flights to Washington, D.C. The company also has
three daily nonstop flights to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport and
plans to add another to that city in June. Since the carrier began
service at the airport last summer, passenger traffic has climbed
41%.</TE>
<TE>   Neeleman added that American had the opportunity to apply for the
27 slots after the Long Beach City Council passed an ordinance in May
2001 extending the time limit for when airlines can use slots at the
airport from six months to two years.</TE>
<TE>   "We applied for these slots fair and square," he said. "All
they're going to do is fly to places we're going to fly to. It's
always been the big guys' feeling that if they match our fares,
people would go on them. But that's not going to happen. We've built
this airline to last."</TE>

<DH>MTA brings poets and performers on board as commuters
become captive audiences.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Garry Scarff boarded the subway ready to unwind after a long day at
school, ignoring a couple clutching the poles and adjusting their
fluorescent orange safety vests.</LD>
<LD>   But when one of them started screaming poetry in his face,
Scarff--and the dozens of other people squished into the train--had
no choice but to take notice.</LD>
<LD>   Trapped by the salvo of rapid-fire verses, the 45-year-old from
Hollywood chose to lose himself in the words.</LD>
<TE>   " ... People from all over/ would come up to me/ and ask me what I
was doing," blared the strapping subway bard, shouting over and
through Scarff's uplifted newspaper and over the groaning wheels and
screeching metal: "I could just look at them/ with this smile on my
face/ and say/ I'm a poet damn it!"</TE>
<TE>   The impromptu poetry session on the Red Line struck Scarff as
"kind of weird for mass transit." But he conceded that the cascade of
uninvited words made him think and supplied him a different kind of
escape from the monotony of his day.</TE>
<TE>   The mass transit poet was Larry Jaffe, one of a troupe of Los
Angeles writers reading poetry in rail cars each Tuesday last month
as part of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's virtual art gallery,
which expanded this year to include experimental and performance art.</TE>
<TE>   Tile mosaics, stained glass and rock sculptures have adorned Los
Angeles' mass transit stations for years, but in recent months they
have been joined by experimental programs--mixing poets and actors in
1940s period costumes with harried commuters on trains and platforms.</TE>
<TE>   MTA art officials say they are bringing the avant garde to buses
and subways to force commuters to interact with artists in a city
notorious for lone commuters hunkered down in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   Among the four MetroLab experimental exhibits are a play about a
picket line of high-fashion garment workers and an installation on
selected light rail cars of sheets of colored transparent plastic.
The microwave-sized "gels" signal each other on the tracks--sounding
like whales calling to their kin.</TE>
<TE>   "You can really do more cutting-edge things with art that doesn't
still need to be relevant a hundred years later," said Maya Emsden,
director of the MTA's MetroArt division. "There's no experimenting
with something that has to be there for that long."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Lazar, a founding Museum of Contemporary Art curator who now
works independently, was on the panel that chose the first set of
MetroLab projects. They started meeting two years ago to cull four
projects from 76 applicants.</TE>
<TE>   One artist wanted to hang wigs from the train ceilings to mimic
the backs of passengers' heads. Another proposed installing an
interactive DVD in one of the stations--where passengers could play
Pac-Man.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for things that were challenging but not
offensive," Lazar said. "It's not that things weren't political....
We just didn't want to take on anything angry the first time around."</TE>
<TE>   The panel chose more accessible works that attempt to focus the
public's awareness about place and cultural connections, Lazar said.
Each artist was awarded $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   Artist George Legrady's project, slated to begin in June at the
7th Street/Metro Center train station, features names he collected
from databases scrolling slowly past each other and lighting up as
they cross.</TE>
<TE>   "These stations are communal public spaces where people cross each
other's paths," said Legrady, an art professor at UC Santa Barbara.
"You might walk by somebody that in two years you might be married
to."</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Bernard and Joseph Hammer's "singing gels" installation is
"about seeing and hearing the city differently, even if it's just for
a second," said Brent Zerger, MTA public arts officer. "Riders
probably don't even recognize they're in an art environment."</TE>
<TE>   The premise behind Jessica Rath's project, an hourlong play
performed 12 times during February, originated from a 1941 photograph
of a picket line in front of the Biltmore Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Rath wrote a three-act play for the 7th Street/Metro Center
station that she hoped would reflect the labor history of the nearby
Garment District.</TE>
<TE>   During the play's final 20 minutes, the actors boarded a Blue Line
train and barked union slogans all the way to the city of Vernon.</TE>
<TE>   "When you use the transit system as a venue," Rath said, "you have
to have some kind of a spectacle to engage an audience that's
surprised you're even there."</TE>
<TE>   Subway art began gaining momentum in the United States in 1977,
when the Department of Transportation started encouraging cities to
use 1% of their construction funds for art.</TE>
<TE>   "Public art brings life to the system," said Wendy Feuer, the
public art and urban design consultant who founded New York City's
Arts in Transit division in 1985. "The system becomes a museum
without walls, bringing art to where the people are rather than
making people go to it."</TE>
<TE>   Most other cities' art programs, including Chicago and New York
City, are focused on renovating current stations, some of which are a
century old.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., one of the Metro board members plans to
introduce a measure that would legalize music performances, to ease
the tension in crowded stations.</TE>
<TE>   One Los Angeles public art official applauded the MTA, which
spends half a percent of construction costs on art, for taking
advantage of the opportunity to make transit art more accessible.</TE>
<TE>   "Public dollars are used for public art," said Felicia Filer,
director of the Public Art Division of the Los Angeles Cultural
Affairs Department. "So the more effort made to give travelers more
accessible forms of art, the more ephemeral, thought-provoking
experience a person is likely to have."</TE>
<TE>   But as much as Scarff and some others seemed inspired by their
brief interlude with art, others were unmoved.</TE>
<TE>   A disheveled, agitated man on one train rose to shout a
five-minute diatribe on society after the subway poets invited others
to share their thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Other passengers shifted uncomfortably, and when the man finished,
a young woman in a pickle-green shirt started shouting that mass
transit was not a place for the arts.</TE>
<TE>   "Every other day of the year, people ignore this man," she said
before leaving the train. "If you can't show him the courtesy of
listening every day, then why do it at all? Poetry is deep, and
there's a lot of people on the trains who might not be ready to get
that deep."</TE>

<LD>Even Alfred Hitchcock's writers never thought of this one. The police
log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise said a driver complained that
"his windshield had been cracked when a crow dropped a steak bone it
had gotten from a restaurant trash can."</LD>
<LD>   Boards that didn't bore: The L.A. City Council, as you may have
read, has voted to ban all new billboards inside the city. Eyesores
they may be, for the most part, but some have provided humor
(intentional and unintentional). Here are a couple I've collected
(see photos):</LD>
<LD>   * The hanging dummy who startled motorists.</LD>
<TE>   * And, the apparent gastric warning for one fast-food maker.</TE>
<TE>   No shrine was safe: My colleague Steve Lopez points out that no
one seems anxious to apologize for the crimes committed during the
L.A. riots of a decade ago. I was reminded of one anonymous young man
who did, however, make partial amends after the violence. He dropped
off a bag of stolen garments with Robert Fambrini, the pastor at the
Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   As Fambrini told the story: "He said he was one of the looters at
Frederick's [of Hollywood]. He wanted to return it but was afraid to
go there." The bag contained two items stolen from the store's
Lingerie Museum: the pantaloons of the late actress Ava Gardner and a
bra donated by actress Katey Sagal of TV's "Married With Children."
Conscience-stricken? Perhaps. Or maybe dissatisfied with the haul.
The thief admitted to the priest that he had been looking for a bra
worn by Madonna, but by the time he had arrived at the store it had
already been stolen.</TE>
<TE>   Why should L.A. have all the fun? David Allen, the columnist of
the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin, read about the campaign to have
Angelenos read Ray Bradbury's novel "Fahrenheit 451" as part of a
national "One Book, One City" campaign. And Allen, wanting to include
his area, has invited his readers to tackle "a 1992 thriller that
offers a darkly comic view of our region and its citrus history.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kem Nunn's 'Pomona Queen,' perhaps
the only novel of suspense whose hero is a vacuum cleaner salesman."</TE>
<TE>   Getting the Shaft: One of the challenges of being a private
investigator, says Frank Crescentini of Long Beach, is that you not
only have to compete against other gumshoes but TV and movie
characters as well. "I had a client tell me, 'Columbo would have done
it different,'" Crescentini said. "I had another guy call me and say,
'I watch "Law and Order" every night so I know exactly how the law
works.' I said, 'So why don't you handle the case yourself?'"</TE>
<TE>   But the topper was a caller who wanted Crescentini to emulate the
private eye in "Shaft."</TE>
<TE>   "This guy said he saw [actor] Samuel Jackson walk into the office
of a police friend and start typing into her computer to get some
information," Crescentini recalled. "I said, 'I can't do that.' The
guy said, 'But I'll give you $100.'"</TE>
<TE>   Crescentini, who doesn't usually watch sleuth shows, said he had
to rent "Shaft" to see if that scene was really in the movie. "It
was," he said. "Unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: My colleague Brady MacDonald spotted a U.S. Postal
Service delivery truck carrying a bumper sticker that said, "Dog
Bites Delay Mail." If I was a mail carrier, I think I might add:
"Yeah, and they can hurt like the dickens too."</TE>

<HD>State Court to Review 2 Murderers' Parole Cases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to review two cases
that test the extent of the governor's authority over parole,
promising resolution of an issue that could affect the fate of
hundreds of imprisoned murderers.</LD>
<LD>   In brief orders released after a closed session, the justices also
said that inmates Robert Rosen- krantz and Mark Smith must remain
behind bars while their cases are decided by the court.</LD>
<LD>   Rosenkrantz and Smith, both from the Los Angeles area, were
convicted of second-degree murder in separate 1985 killings. Both
have maintained clean records while incarcerated and have been judged
ready for release by the state Board of Prison Terms.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, however, has blocked their parole, insisting they
should serve more time. At issue before the justices is whether the
governor's power to do so is absolute or subject to some level of
oversight by the courts.</TE>
<TE>   Legal scholars said the state Supreme Court's decision to step in
signals that the cases involve weighty issues deserving of quick
resolution. The outcome, they added, will either boost or dim the
odds for many other murderers who claim Davis blocked their release
because he has a blanket policy against parole.</TE>
<TE>   During his tenure, Davis has approved only two of 89 parole
recommendations forwarded to him by the Board of Prison Terms.</TE>
<TE>   "The court clearly realized that at some point, it had to resolve
this issue, because there are so many cases backing up behind
Rosenkrantz with the very same elements," said Peter Keane, dean of
Golden Gate University Law School.</TE>
<TE>   The governor welcomed news of the court's decision. In a
statement, he said the court will settle "important constitutional
issues regarding the governor's ability to protect the people of
California from murderers who would otherwise be released on parole."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the inmates had mixed feelings. If the high court
had declined to review the Rosenkrantz case, a lower court's ruling
finding that Davis had improperly blocked his parole would have taken
effect, immediately setting him free.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Rosenkrantz and Smith must remain behind bars while the court
considers their arguments. Their lawyers said they intend to ask the
court to expedite the review, but even if that is granted, no
decision would be forthcoming for months.</TE>
<TE>   "We're disappointed in the short term, but we remain pretty
confident that we'll prevail on the merits once the court looks at
the facts," said Donald Specter, an attorney for Rosenkrantz.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz, convicted of killing a schoolmate who exposed him as
a homosexual on the night of his high school graduation, has come to
symbolize a widening movement against the governor's record of
blocking parole for murderers judged ready for release by his own
parole board.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his election, Davis seemed to signal his intentions
regarding parole for convicted killers, saying, "If you take someone
else's life, forget it."</TE>
<TE>   Under an initiative approved by voters in 1988, the governor
reviews a murder convict's parole grant shortly before his or her
scheduled release. The governor can modify the grant, reverse it or
permit the inmate to go home.</TE>
<TE>   Since Davis' election, the board has recommended freedom for 89
murderers, or about 1% of all cases that have come before it. Davis
has approved parole for just two--both of them battered women who
shot their abusers and, the governor suggested, might never have been
convicted of murder had the battered women's legal defense been
available at the time of trial.</TE>
<TE>   In the Rosenkrantz case, a state appeals court in January said
Davis' record demonstrates that he has a no-parole policy that does
not give each inmate individualized consideration. The court also
said the governor's authority over parole is not absolute under the
law.</TE>
<TE>   Davis appealed, landing the case in the lap of the state Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenkrantz, 34, has been in custody since July 23, 1985, when he
surrendered for the murder of Steven Redman, 17, who told
Rosenkrantz's parents that he was gay. Fearful that his father would
disown him for his sexual orientation, Rosenkrantz fled the family
home and purchased an Uzi. A week later, he confronted Redman and
demanded that he retract the story. When Redman refused, Rosenkrantz
shot him 10 times.</TE>
<TE>   Sentenced to 17 years to life, Rosenkrantz has attracted
widespread support in his quest for parole. Legislators have lobbied
for his freedom, as have the Superior Court judge who presided over
his trial and a detective who investigated the case.</TE>
<TE>   Gay and lesbian groups have characterized Redman's outing of
Rosenkrantz as a hate crime that mitigated the murder that followed.</TE>
<TE>   But in his detailed assessment of the case, Davis said: "The
stress Mr. Rosenkrantz felt over disclosure of his homosexuality does
not minimize the viciousness of this murder." In rejecting parole in
October 2000, Davis said Rosenkrantz still poses "a significant risk
of danger to society."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who suffers from AIDS, dementia, heart disease and cancer,
was convicted in the killing of Rick Diamonon, who was shot and then
drowned in a creek in Topanga Canyon, apparently after an argument
over cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, 46, was declared suitable for parole by the Board of Prison
Terms last June. But Davis overturned the decision, calling Smith a
"person with little regard for human life."</TE>
<TE>   "Smith committed a wanton and violent act against another ... for
something as inconsequential as an unsatisfactory drug deal," Davis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Keith L.
Schwartz said there was no evidence to support the governor's action.
He also said that Davis had wrongly labeled Smith one of the killers,
rather than an accomplice, and had exaggerated his criminal history.</TE>
<TE>   Davis filed an appeal with the 2nd District Court of Appeal, but
the California Supreme Court on Wednesday transferred the case to its
jurisdiction for consideration along with the Rosenkrantz matter.</TE>
<TE>   Two justices--Joyce Kennard and Carlos Moreno--said Smith, whose
AIDS is terminal, should go free pending action by the court. But
they were outvoted by the other justices.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame for Mark Smith that he was not released pending
consideration by the Supreme Court," said his attorney, Rowan Klein.
"He is so ill and infirm it's clear he's not dangerous to anybody."</TE>

<HD>John F. Cullen, 80; Canadian Disc Jockey Was 'Irreverent
Rebel'</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>John Francis "Jack" Cullen, 80, a madcap Canadian disc jockey who
became friends with some of the leading names in entertainment but
angered Frank Sinatra, died over the weekend in Vancouver of heart
failure, it was announced Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Cullen spent five decades at Vancouver's radio CKNW as host of the
late show "Owl Prowl" before he was forced off the air in a shakeup
in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Known as "the irreverent rebel in radio," he interviewed visiting
celebrities and became friends with, among many others, Bob Hope,
Sammy Davis Jr. and Henry Mancini.</LD>
<TE>   Jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong was so charmed by Cullen that he
authorized the official release of a bootleg recording Cullen made of
him in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   But Sinatra was less amused. In 1957, Cullen plied ushers with
booze so he could hide under a Vancouver stage to record Sinatra
singing. Angered, Sinatra refused ever to do an interview with
Cullen, and had him blackballed and scolded by the American
Federation of Musicians.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vancouver, Cullen served in the Canadian navy as a
wireless operator in World War II and then attended the Sprott-Shaw
School of Commerce and Radio in Vancouver. He began working at CKNW
in 1949.</TE>

<HD>Prayer Day Double-Teamed</HD>
<DH>Religion: An interfaith event is planned to counter what
some clergy say is growing Christian domination of the observance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two groups of worshipers will gather today at the Ventura County
Government Center to participate in the National Day of Prayer.</LD>
<LD>   They will sing and pray to God. They just won't do it together.</LD>
<LD>   Saying the Day of Prayer event at the government center is
increasingly being taken over by conservative Christians to the
exclusion of other faiths, a group of clergy will hold its own
interfaith celebration today.</LD>
<TE>   It will be the first time since the event began in the early 1990s
that there will be separate prayer services across from the
government center. It's a welcome change, say ministers participating
in the interfaith service today. Although the National Day of Prayer
is supposed to be nondenominational, critics say it has long had a
distinctly Christian feel.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, participants in the Day of Prayer event at the
government center protested abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County religious leaders are not alone in seeking an
alternative. Separate prayer events will take place across Southern
California as clerics seek to inject an interfaith emphasis in the
event.</TE>
<TE>   That was the goal of Rabbi John Sherwood of Oxnard, president of
the Ventura Interfaith Ministerial Assn., when he started planning
the local interfaith event a year ago. He was aided by a local Muslim
leader, a Unitarian minister and several local Christian pastors.</TE>
<TE>   Today's interfaith gathering will take place at 9 a.m. across from
the government center. The second National Day of Prayer gathering is
at noon.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a statement that Ventura County celebrates diversity and
that no one religion has the right to dominate the American cultural
scene," Sherwood said. "The founders of this nation pictured a nation
of diversity."</TE>
<TE>   It's not about religious domination, said Fawn Parish of Ventura's
South Coast Fellowship Church. Those who have come to previous prayer
events know they are getting a healthy serving of New Testament
scriptures and plenty of unabashed tributes to Jesus Christ, said
Parish, who helped organize the noontime prayer service today.</TE>
<TE>   "In our heart it is to be inclusive," said Parish, who presided
over last year's gathering. "But it's not time to sit down and sing
'Kumbaya.' This is not a conversion day. We believe Jesus is
distinctive."</TE>
<TE>   Parish said that bringing together Christians and non-Christians
in an organized prayer service is akin to "diluting it or mixing the
paint to the point where there is no color at all."</TE>
<TE>   Observance of National Day of Prayer on the first Thursday of May
was declared by President Reagan in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Bringing different faiths together was never the intention of the
annual nationwide prayer gathering, said Jim Weidmann, vice chairman
of the National Day of Prayer Task Force, a conservative Christian
group in Colorado Springs, Colo., that is among the largest
organizers of Day of Prayer events.</TE>
<TE>   Both Weidmann and Parish said they aren't opposed to non-Christian
prayer events. Just don't expect them or those they represent to
attend.</TE>
<TE>   "If you mix [faiths], you are not holding true to the expressions
you believe and we are trying to hold true to the Christian
expression," Weidmann said. "It comes down to a simple decision like
on Sunday. Where are you going to go to church?"</TE>
<TE>   In the San Fernando Valley, several church officials from
different denominations will meet today at Valley Beth Shalom Temple
in Encino for their second interfaith service, said Barry Smedburg,
executive director of the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council.</TE>
<TE>   The interfaith service will be held for the first time at the
temple, said Smedburg, adding that organizers expect to attract their
biggest attendance.</TE>
<TE>   Smedburg said the council formed its own prayer group two years
ago after attempts to share the stage for the annual service with
evangelical groups failed.</TE>

<HD>Armed Driver Killed by Police</HD>
<DH>Violence: Tow truck operator wounded by gun-wielding
motorist near Camp Pendleton.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OCEANSIDE</DL>
<LD>A stranded motorist along Interstate 5 shot a tow truck driver who
stopped to help him, then fired at a Marine from nearby Camp
Pendleton, and finally was shot to death by police as he attempted to
escape into bushes on the base, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The bizarre incident north of Oceanside closed the freeway for an
hour, backing up early morning southbound traffic for at least 10
miles, according to the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   FBI spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said investigators have yet to
determine a motive for the shooting. "There was no altercation,"
Caldwell said.</LD>
<TE>   The county medical examiner identified the dead man as Henry
Ricardo Enciso Jr., 26, of Duarte.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began about 7:30 a.m. when a driver from a tow truck
company in San Marcos, under contract to the CHP, stopped along the
shoulder of the freeway to help a motorist in an older-model
Cadillac, Caldwell said. The Cadillac driver shot the tow truck
driver several times as he approached the car, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A Marine lance corporal attending a training session at a base
chapel near the freeway heard the shots and ran to aid the downed tow
truck driver. The Cadillac driver fired several times at the Marine,
who ran toward the tow truck driver, picked him up and carried him to
safety.</TE>
<TE>   "He was very courageous, the epitome of a Marine," said Caldwell.
"He showed no concern for his own safety, only for helping the
wounded man."</TE>
<TE>   Police from the Oceanside and El Cajon police departments were on
the base for a training session and responded to the call. Along with
military police, they confronted the suspect along a road in the
Santa Margarita River section of the base.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the fatal shot was fired by police or military officers
has not been determined, Caldwell said.</TE>
<TE>   The tow truck driver, identified as Brian Naylor, 23, was taken by
helicopter to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. He was listed in
fair condition after surgery for wounds to his abdomen and buttocks
from three or more bullets, a hospital spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cadillac is registered to a Norwalk woman who said an
ex-boyfriend was driving it.</TE>

<HD>Newspapers May Publish Photos of Officer Suspected in
Rapes, Court Rules</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An appellate court Wednesday rejected a judge's decision to block the
Los Angeles Times and other news organizations from publishing
photographs of a San Bernardino police officer accused of raping at
least 11 women.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the state's 4th District Court of Appeal took
effect immediately.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge W. Robert
Fawke granted the media permission to take photographs of Ronald
Allen VanRossum, 37, a 14-year San Bernardino Police Department
veteran accused of raping women he encountered while on patrol.</LD>
<TE>   But after a defense attorney and a prosecutor protested, the judge
ordered the media not to publish any of the pictures that had already
been taken. The Times and the Press-Enterprise of Riverside asked the
appeals court to overturn the decision, and the newspapers' petition
was granted Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has a right to observe what goes on in the courts,"
said Alonzo Wickers, a Los Angeles-based attorney who represented The
Times. "The Constitution does not give the court the authority to
stop newspapers from publishing photographs that they lawfully
attained. That is a well-recognized principle and it goes to the very
core of the 1st Amendment's provisions for free speech and free
press."</TE>
<TE>   William J. Hadden, VanRossum's defense attorney, said he had hoped
that blocking the publication of the photograph would protect
potential jurors from being swayed. And, he said, publishing
VanRossum's photo could prompt other women from the San Bernardino
area to bring additional charges against the officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not want anyone coming out of the woodwork and saying,
'Gee, I'm a victim,' based on the fact that his face is out there,"
Hadden said. "Both sides wanted the jury pool not to be tainted, but
they also wanted to protect the integrity of the investigation that
is ongoing."</TE>
<TE>   Wickers said there is "no conceivable way that the mere
publication of the defendant's photograph could in any way prejudice
a jury pool so that 12 impartial jurors could not be found in a
county with 2 million residents."</TE>
<TE>   He said there is a significant public interest in publishing
VanRossum's photo, giving "other potential victims the opportunity to
come forward, perhaps because they will recognize that they were not
the sole victim."</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum is scheduled to be arraigned in June on more than two
dozen charges associated with the rapes of 11 women. Two other women
have come forward to police since those charges were filed.</TE>
<TE>   VanRossum's attorney has said the officer is not guilty.</TE>

<HD>A Race to Save Baby Salmon in Klamath</HD>
<DH>Survival: Biologists rescue hundreds of fish stranded by
low water levels as river's flow is channeled to farm fields.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As more Klamath River water is diverted to farms upstream and water
levels drop, California state biologists have begun rescuing baby
salmon stranded in puddles along river banks.</LD>
<LD>   In recent days, the biologists have rescued about 300 fish from
two spots along the river northwest of Mt. Shasta, near the Oregon
border. They are expanding their search to 13 more sites where lower
river levels may leave salmon with too little water to survive.</LD>
<LD>   In late March, U.S. Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Agriculture
Secretary Ann Veneman personally opened head gates that diverted
water from the Klamath River's source into farm fields along the
California-Oregon border.</LD>
<TE>   The officials were responding to pleas and protests from farmers
deprived of irrigation water last year by a record drought and a
federal decision to channel water to rare fish and away from farm
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Now, biologists fear that by giving farmers more water, federal
agencies are endangering the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Biologists for the Yurok tribe and U.S. Forest Service employees
last week rescued about 130 stranded young salmon, some just 1 or 2
inches long, and another 150 fish of various other species near the
town of Happy Camp.</TE>
<TE>   The fish included about 100 rare coho salmon, which are protected
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Most fish near Happy Camp were
rescued alive, but a few coho and Chinook salmon were found dead, and
others may have been eaten by birds, said Bill Bemis, watershed
recreation officer at the local ranger district of the Klamath
National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The killing or harassment of a protected species is forbidden
under federal law. But officials said Wednesday it was too soon to
determine whether the stranding amounted to harassment under the
Endangered Species Act.</TE>
<TE>   "We are investigating what's happening, and we are documenting
what's happening, in terms of change in river flow," said Gary
Stacey, regional fisheries program manager with the state Department
of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   The coho salmon is also a candidate for protection under the
California Endangered Species Act, which means the state Department
of Fish and Game must treat it as if it were already listed. The
department's recommendation on whether to officially list the fish is
due out within days.</TE>
<TE>   Department Director Bob Hight said he heard about the stranded
fish Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We have people on the ground working to resolve issues," said
Hight, adding that he did not have enough facts to know whether state
law had been violated. He said the department plans to contact the
Bureau of Reclamation about the stranding. "We just wanted to get all
our facts together before we did anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A federal district judge Wednesday scheduled a hearing for Friday
to consider a request by fishermen and environmentalists who are
seeking a court order providing more water for salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Heeding farmers' concerns, the Bush administration has assured
farmers that they will not see a repeat of last year's water cutoff,
and has proposed river flows that some fish biologists consider too
low for the salmon. The National Marine Fisheries Service, which
oversees rare fish such as the coho salmon, is still working on a
required scientific study of how those flows will affect the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Although thousands of salmon died last year in dried-up rivers
that feed the Klamath, biologists consider this spring's smaller toll
significant because it came relatively early in the season, when only
limited amounts of river water are being channeled to farm fields. It
also occurred in the Klamath itself, rather than in tributaries more
prone to drying up.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the stranded fish were found close to Iron Gate Dam, which
separates the free-flowing lower river from the upstream diversions
that are part of a 95-year-old U.S. Bureau of Reclamation project
that channels water to 1,400 farmers in the Upper Klamath Basin.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, reclamation officials have lowered the river flow
below Iron Gate from 1,742 cubic feet per second to 1,347 cubic feet,
and they have permission to drop the flow to 1,043 cubic feet as of
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau spokesman Jeff McCracken said that the flows stood at 1,350
cubic feet per second as of Wednesday and that his agency wanted to
make sure an upstream lake was filled with water for irrigation.</TE>
<TE>   "We adjust our releases in order to fill the lake," he said. "We
are maintaining the releases that have been approved by the National
Marine Fisheries Service."</TE>
<TE>   McCracken said he had not heard about the stranded fish, but
added, "If [the fisheries service] calls us up and says we have to
talk about flows, we will talk to them."</TE>
<TE>   The fisheries service is studying how quickly the river's water
levels dropped, and how that may be tied to the stranded salmon, said
Jim Lecky, the agency's assistant regional administrator for
protected resources.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get all the facts and figure out what happened," he
said.</TE>

<HD>Sanchez Lawyers Dispute Rape Charge</HD>
<DH>Courts: Defense attorneys say there is no evidence to
support that or kidnapping allegation in the slaying of a Moorpark
student.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Simi Valley handyman Vincent Sanchez gunned down college student
Megan Barroso with a high-powered assault rifle last July and dumped
her body in a ravine, his attorneys conceded Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   But there is no evidence to show he did so during an attempted
rape or kidnapping, they argued in urging a Ventura County judge to
throw out those charges.</LD>
<LD>   "We have not disputed that Mr. Sanchez shot and killed Megan
Barroso," Chief Deputy Public Defender Neil Quinn argued. "But he is
charged with several substantive crimes that he did not commit."</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that the 31-year-old Sanchez, who has admitted
raping seven women during a five-year string of prowler-style attacks
in Simi Valley, pulled Barroso from her shot-up car and sexually
assaulted her before she died.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth argued that evidence
presented during a preliminary hearing proves that Sanchez is a
rapist whose intent was to sexually assault Barroso.</TE>
<TE>   A 20-year-old Moorpark resident and community college student,
Barroso was shot in the abdomen as she drove home July 5. Her remains
were found a month later in a canyon 15 miles from the intersection
where she was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities found her blood in Sanchez's truck and a jacket she
was wearing that night in his house. They also matched bullet casings
found at the intersection to an AK-47 assault rifle seized from his
home.</TE>
<TE>   Henke-Dobroth told Superior Court Judge Ken Riley that Sanchez
kept Barroso's jacket as a "trophy," as with jewelry and panties
taken from other victims.</TE>
<TE>   But Quinn and Deputy Public Defender Jan Helfrich argued that the
shooting was inconsistent with Sanchez's prior sexual assaults.</TE>
<TE>   In those cases, Sanchez methodically studied his victims and
carefully planned the attacks, often cutting phone lines and
unscrewing porch lights before slipping into victims' homes through
unlocked windows or doors.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn argued that the Barroso shooting was different. If Sanchez
had wanted to rape Barroso, the lawyer suggested, he would not have
used such lethal force.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn further argued that prosecutors have presented no physical
evidence to support a rape or attempted rape charge. Although Barroso
was found wearing only a T-shirt and panties, her body was so
decomposed that the coroner could not determine whether a sexual
assault had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   As for the alleged kidnapping, Quinn argued that evidence found in
the bullet-riddled car suggests Barroso fell unconscious moments
after being shot. He pointed to a pool of blood on the passenger-side
floor, which he said was probably caused by an unmoving hand dripping
blood onto the carpet.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that Barroso's cell phone, lying on the floor, was
untouched. And a crime scene expert testified that he found no
evidence of a struggle inside the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Because the law defines kidnapping as the moving of a person
against his or her will, Quinn argued that the charge cannot be
proven if Barroso was unconscious.</TE>
<TE>   Arguments are to resume today.</TE>

<LD>A high school administrator was placed on paid leave Wednesday as
officials investigate complaints from parents that she checked to see
if girls were wearing thong underwear to a dance.</LD>
<LD>   Rita Wilson, assistant principal at Rancho Bernardo High since
1997, was placed on leave by Poway Unified School District Supt. Don
Phillips. Wilson allegedly was checking to determine if girls had
defied her ban on the skimpy underwear.</LD>
<LD>   "If these allegations prove to be true, the actions [at the dance]
were clearly outside our school district's policies and procedures,"
Phillips said.</LD>
<TE>   The underwear checks allegedly occurred at a Friday costume party
dance attended by 725 students.</TE>

<LD>A group of environmental, consumer and labor organizations filed suit
to stop the federal government from allowing Mexican trucks to
operate in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   The suit seeks to block implementation of safety and operational
regulations that are to be met before the government can lift a 1982
ban on Mexican trucks.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters of the regulations said opponents are trying to stifle
trade between the countries, but environmentalists and unions said
the trucks aren't safe enough to enter the United States.</LD>

<HD>SCAG a 'High-Risk' Funds Recipient, Auditors Report</HD>
<DH>Government: A Caltrans study finds flaws in how the
regional planning agency uses state, federal grants. The group has
appealed the findings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY L. RABIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Southern California Assn. of Governments, the regional planning
agency for a vast, six-county area with 17 million residents, has
been designated a "high-risk" recipient of state and federal funds
after government auditors found a history of financial and other
internal problems.</LD>
<LD>   Documents obtained under the California Public Records Act show
Caltrans officials assigned the high-risk rating in December and
reaffirmed it in February after a team of auditors examined the
association's use of state and federal grants during the years 1998
to 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The audit, finished in June of last year, found "material
weaknesses" in the association's accounting system, purchasing
processes and internal controls.</LD>
<TE>   Auditors also suggested that the agency may have used state and
federal grants for purposes other than those for which they were
intended.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the association are scheduled to receive an update
today on the audit and the agency's financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are potentially significant for the planning agency,
which helps set regional priorities and can steer grant money to
projects it deems worthy.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, the association has been faced with rising legal
costs, interest payments and expenses related to a failed business
venture.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, SCAG has been slow to pay some bills, and the effect
of that is subtly rippling through the region's governments and the
projects they are trying to build.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the construction authority building a light rail
line from Los Angeles to Pasadena has been forced to tap its own
reserves because SCAG has not paid for a study on extending the line
to Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the problems could grow worse if officials are not
convinced that the association is improving. Two-thirds of the
association's $35-million budget comes from Washington and
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   SCAG officials insist that progress has been made to correct the
problems and new systems are in place to closely monitor contracts
and spending, but the agency's cash flow problems have continued.</TE>
<TE>   Bert Becker, the association's chief financial officer, is
expected to report at the organization's annual meeting today that
the agency owes $2.2 million to consultants, contractors and groups
of local governments.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of past due obligations to consultants is
substantial," Becker said in a memo to the 188 cities and six
counties that are members of the regional agency.</TE>
<TE>   The association develops transportation, air quality, aviation,
housing and other plans to guide future growth in a sprawling region
that includes Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino
and Imperial counties.</TE>
<TE>   The agency, which has 175 employees, depends on state and federal
funds and membership dues to operate.</TE>
<TE>   The association does not have the power to determine land uses or
decide the fate of development projects.</TE>
<TE>   But the little-known agency does wield significant influence over
highway and transportation projects, which must be included in its
regional transportation plan to receive state and federal funding.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the association has been at the center of
Southern California's airport debate.</TE>
<TE>   The agency assigned Orange County a major share of the region's
future air travel demand by backing an airport at the former El Toro
Marine Corps Air Station, only to have voters reject the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Bounced Checks Lead to Caltrans Audit</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans initiated the audit of the agency after chronic cash-flow
problems led to two bounced checks in 1999 and forced an agonizing
self-examination of internal weaknesses at the nation's largest
metropolitan planning organization.</TE>
<TE>   Sandra Balmir, a planner with the Federal Highway Administration
in Los Angeles, told the association's Regional Council in February
that the state audit found major problems.</TE>
<TE>   Balmir said SCAG has a history of unsatisfactory performance, is
not financially stable, has a management system that does not meet
standards, has not conformed to the terms and conditions of previous
grants and otherwise is "not responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Brian J. Smith, Caltrans deputy director of planning, wrote in
December that "the audit found sufficient cause to categorize the
agency as a 'high risk' recipient" of state and federal funds.</TE>
<TE>   The designation marks the first time that Caltrans has applied the
high-risk rating to a council of governments in California.</TE>
<TE>   Smith noted in a letter that the regional agency "has significant
cash-flow problems" and has not complied with the terms and
conditions of its agreements with state and federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans put SCAG officials on notice that the agency must prepare
a detailed financial and business plan to resolve each of the issues
raised in the audit or risk losing vital assistance from Sacramento
and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the critical report, association officials led by
longtime Executive Director Mark Pisano have mounted an aggressive
appeal of the audit's findings.</TE>
<TE>   "SCAG believes there is no basis for Caltrans to claim there is a
'history' of unsatisfactory performance based on one audit over an
18-month period that occurred after 33 years of successful
operations," Pisano wrote in a protest letter.</TE>
<TE>   The agency does not dispute the finding that it was financially
unstable at the time of the audit. Nor did it contest the conclusion
that its management systems during the period were substandard.</TE>
<TE>   But Pisano said in an interview there was no misuse of state or
federal funds by his agency.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted that the problems identified in the audit have been
corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made progress," Pisano said. "We're confident what we have
done resolves the issues in the audit."</TE>
<TE>   Pisano said he expects the regional agency will get "a clean bill
of health" when state auditors review what has been accomplished
since their last report.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Caltrans nor the FHA would comment while specific issues
in the audit are being appealed. But Caltrans spokesman Dennis
Trujillo said state transportation officials will be meeting with
agency representatives "to understand their concerns."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Pisano, Caltrans' Smith did acknowledge that "SCAG
has made progress since the audit with their accounting and
administrative processes."</TE>
<TE>   At the time of the audit, SCAG did not require contract managers
to perform proper contract administration.</TE>
<TE>   Financial monitoring was a low priority, the audit concluded.</TE>
<TE>   "Some contract managers reviewed invoices and kept track of
expenditures and others did not," the auditors said. "If expenditures
are not monitored, the contract manager cannot maintain control of
contract costs. A lack of control may result in cost overruns,
untimely detection of problems, and/or payments in excess of
contractual agreements."</TE>
<TE>   The auditors concluded that "weak controls in SCAG's procurement
procedures place federal and state funds at risk."</TE>
<TE>   To gain better control over contracts, the agency has installed
new computer and software systems, placed its legal counsel in charge
of contracts and employee relations, and brought in staff experienced
in finance and internal controls.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to ease the agency's cash crunch, Becker said the
association has significantly raised membership dues. To provide
working capital, the agency obtained a $3.5-million bank line of
credit, which was raised recently to $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   External Forces Affect Agency's Finances</TE>
<TE>   Interest payments have risen accordingly, as have concerns about
the agency's ability to repay the borrowed funds. A number of other
factors have aggravated the agency's financial woes.</TE>
<TE>   Legal expenses are consuming a large share of the agency's budget.
A series of lawsuits have been filed challenging the association's
projections of future population growth and its allocation of future
air traffic in Southern California. The agency also paid $375,000 to
settle a lawsuit filed by a former agency attorney who was
terminated. An insurance company is expected to pay most of the
settlement cost and the agency's $1 million in legal fees in that
hard-fought case.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's efforts to branch out have run into trouble as
well. It lost an estimated $210,000 on a $2.1-million contract to
provide New York state with computer software that prepares a
personalized itinerary for residents or visitors wishing to use mass
transit.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors wrote that they found no evidence that the association's
participation in the New York project was approved by agency
committees or the Regional Council, a 72-member body that sets
policy. Agency officials say the New York project had all the
necessary approvals.</TE>
<TE>   Before undertaking such projects, the auditors said the agency
must "ensure that it has sufficient funds to finance the work without
worsening its already precarious cash-flow situation."</TE>
<TE>   The audit notes that in some instances the agency billed Caltrans
for reimbursement of costs that had not been paid to the consultants
or contractors who did the work.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, it used the funds received to pay general business
expenses other than what the agency claimed in its request for
reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   The audit was particularly critical of a lack of control over
purchase orders, which were used to buy supplies and hire
consultants. In five cases, purchase orders were used to pay $100,000
or more.</TE>
<TE>   "SCAG did not appear to perform any type of competitive selection
process when procuring goods or services using [purchase orders],"
the audit found. "Competition is important to ensure that the goods
and services are received at the lowest price and that state and
federal funds are used effectively and efficiently."</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials said they no longer use purchase orders to hire
consultants without competitive bidding.</TE>

<HD>N. Hollywood High Looks for the Formula to Repeat</HD>
<DH>Scholastics: School's five-member Science Bowl squad leaves
for Washington, D.C., to defend its national championship against 63
teams this weekend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The five members of North Hollywood High School's defending
championship Science Bowl team travel this weekend to Washington,
D.C., feeling the way hip-hop's Beastie Boys once boasted in song:
"I've got science for any occasion, postulating theorems, formulating
equations."</LD>
<LD>   But where the Beastie Boys' knowledge of science is suspect, the
North Hollywood team's is anything but.</LD>
<LD>   After winning five consecutive regional titles at the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power Science Bowl, the school is making its
fifth trip in a row to the national competition. The new champions
will be announced Monday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   "I went through this last year, so I'm a little more confident
this time," said senior David Lee, who plans to attend MIT in the
fall. "But I have no predictions. National [competition] is
unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   The team spent most of Wednesday afternoon at Lee's house in
Northridge, cramming in some studying before taking an evening
flight.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, I really got acclimated to the whole environment,"
said Stanford-bound senior Julia Hu of the national competition. "And
this year, you bequeath your bowl knowledge to younger members."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Len Soloff said he was impressed by how hard the students
have worked and thinks the team will benefit from having two
returning seniors.</TE>
<TE>   "The team that beats us will really have to know their stuff,"
said Soloff, who has been involved in the program for five years and
has been head coach for two.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the team are senior Justin Burdick and juniors Edward
Marti and Zahra Yazdani.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Academic Decathlon, which is slower-paced and includes
the arts, the Science Bowl is a rapid-fire contest that judges
students on chemistry, physics, biology, earth science, computer
science, math and astronomy.</TE>
<TE>   The competition, organized by the U.S. Department of Energy, is
modeled on the "General Electric College Bowl" quiz show, which was
heard on radio and then seen on television from the 1950s to 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's 11th annual contest will feature 64 teams from 41
states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</TE>
<TE>   California again dominates the schools competing this year,
sending nine teams, including one from Santa Monica High School.</TE>
<TE>   Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas and Washington are each sending three
teams.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District has won four national titles
since the competition's inaugural year. In addition to North
Hollywood's victory last year, Venice High took the honors in 1997
and 1996, and Van Nuys High won in 1995. Van Nuys and Venice placed
second and third, respectively, in the regional competition in
February.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the tradition going at North Hollywood, the school also
fields a "B" team that often finds itself in the thick of competition
at the regional level. Those students then graduate to the "A" team
the following year.</TE>
<TE>   As for this year's group, members say they're ready.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always more to study," Hu said, "but we've done the best
we could."</TE>

<HD>Lawmaker's Bill to Tax Soda Fizzles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A state senator has abandoned her plan to raise taxes on soda to help
fight childhood obesity.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Deborah Ortiz (D-Sacramento) cited a lack of support among
Democrats and Republicans for her plan to add a tax of about 2 cents
per 12-ounce serving of soda and other sweetened drinks. The tax
would have raised more than $340 million a year and would have been
used to combat rising rates of obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis
among children.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew it was going to be hugely difficult, if not impossible, to
get a tax imposed," Ortiz said. "But I wanted to raise the topic."</LD>
<TE>   Ortiz said Wednesday that she now will push to phase out soda
sales in elementary schools by 2004, middle schools by 2005 and high
schools by 2007. She said the changes to her bill, SB 1520, stay true
to her larger goal of improving the quality of foods and beverages
sold to students at schools.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing last month, Ortiz testified that children consume
more soda than water or milk and that one-third of California
children are overweight or obese. She planned to use the money from
the soda tax proposal to fund health-education programs and help
schools get out of the business of selling sodas and junk foods to
children on campus. Ortiz was referring to contracts some districts
have signed with soft drink companies to raise money for activities
and programs.</TE>
<TE>   While garnering strong support among health-care advocates and
school administrators, Ortiz's soda tax plan faced stiff opposition
from members of California's business, restaurant and soda
industries. It also angered conservative lawmakers who took issue
with what they described as Ortiz's big-government approach.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine) said he was pleased that
Ortiz realized the public opposes "further taxes and further
demonizing of products they enjoy."</TE>

<HD>Cultivating Creativity at the Wiltern Theater</HD>
<DH>The opulent concert and office complex, a Hollywood icon
since the 1930s, is a haven for artists and entertainers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Wiltern Theater is a mood piece--intensely vertical, angled to
the street, its terra-cotta facade as green as an algae-covered pier.</LD>
<LD>   Opulent, mysterious, it is filled with chandeliers and hidden
rooms and crowned by a great plaster sunburst on the ceiling above
the main stage.</LD>
<LD>   The pastel glow of the ornate interior makes entering the Wiltern
"seem like going into an enchanted grotto," recalled Catherine
Mulholland, who often walked to the theater in the 1930s, when it was
one of Los Angeles' grand movie palaces. "I just felt like we were
going into some wonderful, mystic cavern."</LD>
<TE>   The Wiltern is urban and on some days sullen, the sort of building
you'd notice on rainy afternoons in New York. Named for a street
corner--Wilshire Boulevard and Western Avenue--the Art-Deco
masterpiece has survived earthquakes, the burning of Koreatown during
the 1992 riots, and the attempts of one prior owner to tear it
down--a campaign that inspired picketing in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Movies gave way long ago to concerts and live stage: styles and
personalities ranging from Johnny Mathis to Bruce Springsteen, Andrew
Dice Clay to Jerry Seinfeld, Marcel Marceau to Mikhail Baryshnikov.
Muhammad Ali's 50th birthday celebration was filmed at the Wiltern.
The same 2,200-seat theater has featured the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, the American Video Awards, "Porgy and Bess,"
Mummenschanz and the Boys Choir of Harlem.</TE>
<TE>   A 12-story tower rises above the theater and gives the Wiltern
complex its imposing profile. The tower is a haven for creative
artists. Tenants include four architectural firms, two Hollywood
set-design companies, several screenwriters and television writers,
and an outfit that assembles sound stages.</TE>
<TE>   "Every last one of them said, 'I need to get into the Wiltern,'"
said property manager Leisanne Ontario. "They just draw to this
building; it's amazing. People in the building consider it their
muse."</TE>
<TE>   The Cinema Makeup School has occupied an airy space on the third
floor for three years.</TE>
<TE>   Purple-haired instructor Lee Joyner, a man with experience in
"Godzilla," "The Arrival" and other film projects, teaches "creature
effects," an eight-week course in which students learn how to fashion
"Star Trek"-style masks and engineer monsters controlled by cables
and inflatable bladders.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the best things about Wiltern," he said, "is the
theatrical element. As opposed to being in some square, concrete
building, we come into this beautiful theater that's a Hollywood
icon. It really helps open the mind to the creative juices, helps the
students get into the mind-set of being Hollywood makeup artists.
They love coming here."</TE>
<TE>   Joyner's students devote four weeks to their outlandish masks,
chiseling out the molds, whipping up foam latex in an electric mixer.
When the creatures are finished, students like to wander the building
or venture down to the street.</TE>
<TE>   "Every once in a while you find Klingons in the coffee shop," said
screenwriter Robert Ramsey, who shares a tiny fourth-floor suite with
his writing partner, Matthew Stone.</TE>
<TE>   They took the office two years ago, and did the script for "Big
Trouble," a Tim Allen farce recently in theaters about a nuclear bomb
stashed in a suitcase. The writers are now at work on a black comedy
about the mob.</TE>
<TE>   Being in Koreatown, in a neighborhood busy with street life,
inspires them, Stone said. They like the action, the fact that they
can walk to lunch and encounter crowds on the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like another city sometimes," Stone said. "We've always
loved the Wiltern building. You don't have to have the
air-conditioner on. You can just open the windows and get fresh air
and hear the traffic."</TE>
<TE>   Their suite has a view of the Hollywood sign and buildings west
along Wilshire as far as Century City. The W and I of the theater's
big vertical "Wiltern" sign hang just outside their window, filling
the room with red and blue neon when they're working late.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great," Stone said. "We feel like we're detectives in a
Raymond Chandler story."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler was just beginning to write his hard-boiled detective
fiction about the time the Wiltern opened, in 1931. The land had been
part of a sheep ranch owned by Germain Pellissier, whose name now
graces the office tower. Pellissier's grandson, Henry de Roulet,
negotiated with Warner Bros. to build a flagship for the nationwide
theater chain that would rank among the finest anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Architects G. Albert Landsburgh and Stiles O. Clements devised an
Art Deco design incorporating recessed windows into a visual upward
thrust capped by a square secondary tower.</TE>
<TE>   The interior, with its oval rotunda and Anthony Heinsbergen
murals, includes a second-floor conference room with a marble
bathroom and tiny kitchen concealed behind walnut panels.</TE>
<TE>   The Wiltern became recognized as "a virtual catalog of the trends
which ultimately comprised the Art Deco movement," according to a
written history. "Visitors encounter rooms in French Moderne, German
Bauhaus, Cubistic, Streamline Moderne and classical American
skyscraper motifs. Skillfully integrated in a sequence of spaces,
they constitute a three-dimensional record of a brief but important
moment in architectural history."</TE>
<TE>   An anchor for a stretch of Wilshire that already included the Art
Deco Bullocks Wilshire store and the Ambassador Hotel, the Wiltern
influenced the city's Deco period.</TE>
<TE>   Its grandeur, however, could never save it from hardship. Only a
year after its spectacular opening, the theater closed temporarily
for lack of revenue. Revived in the mid-1930s, it continued to
languish as commerce and night life gravitated east to downtown and
west to the beaches.</TE>
<TE>   The Franklin Life Insurance Co. bought the Wiltern in the 1950s,
and tried to raze it in 1979. Angry over the loss of the Art Deco
Richfield Building downtown and a number of other structures,
preservationists turned the theater into a cause celebre.</TE>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles Conservancy ... said: 'We need to do whatever we
can to stop the demolition of L.A. landmarks,'" recalled Wayne
Ratkovich. "Until the Wiltern came along, either the battle hadn't
been fought or, to the extent it had been fought, it had been lost."</TE>
<TE>   Ratkovich, a developer, saved the Wiltern from the wrecking
ball--and lost millions for it. At the urging of then-Los Angeles
City Councilman John Ferraro, he bought the Wiltern in 1981 and
invested heavily in restoration, only to be hit by a fiscal triple
whammy: the riots, which destroyed much of Koreatown; the Northridge
earthquake, which caused damage throughout the Wiltern; and a Metro
Rail construction project that tore up much of Wilshire.</TE>
<TE>   "A calamity," is how Ratkovich describes those events. "It was
impossible to recover."</TE>
<TE>   He sold the Wiltern a few years ago to the Hertz Investment Group,
a partnership that also owns the Oviatt Building downtown and other
historic properties. Although the theater is dark some nights and
lease rates are far below buildings in Century City, the Wiltern has
but a single vacancy and is enjoying a bit of a revival, manager
Ontario said.</TE>
<TE>   "We love our space," said Thomas Mann, associate director of the
American Institute of Architects, which occupies the eighth floor
after leaving the more expensive Pacific Design Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a thousand times happier here. The space is obviously
designed by architects. It keeps the creative juices and the thoughts
flowing."</TE>

<HD>CSUCI, Tech Firms Bolster Ties</HD>
<DH>Education: As ground is broken for a science building,
school's technology partnership is also celebrated.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Representatives of the county's technology industry gathered with
faculty members from Cal State Channel Islands on Wednesday to
celebrate groundbreaking for the school's science building--and a
partnership that could ultimately change the business landscape of
Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   The CSUCI, Business and Technology Partnership was formed two
years ago to launch a collaboration between technology firms and the
new university. Earlier this year the coalition surveyed businesses
in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties to learn about hiring needs,
hiring trends and employee skills.</LD>
<LD>   The results of the survey offer guidelines for structuring science
and technology programs and designing curriculum at Cal State Channel
Islands.</LD>
<TE>   "We're trying to create a response to the needs of the future,"
university President Richard Rush said. But the school also will
benefit from the partnership, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't reach our goals without their support, and they can't
reach their goals without our resources," Rush said.</TE>
<TE>   John Philo, vice president of Alliance Protein Laboratories,
already has been supporting the new school. The company is a
university tenant and Philo has helped with faculty selection. Once
the science program begins, Philo said, he hopes to offer students
internships at his company.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the biotechnology giant Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks,
recently donated $75,000 in laboratory equipment to the university.
Another firm has inquired about donating medical equipment,
university officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's symposium attracted more than 100 tech-firm
representatives. Lou Tomasetta, chief executive of Vitesse
Semiconductor in Camarillo, made a presentation underscoring the
importance of the partnership and the potential effect on the region.</TE>
<TE>   "Bedroom communities can't work on a large scale," Tomasetta said.
"Ventura is basically an agricultural community, but it's going
through a transition. It's going to require an industrial base."</TE>
<TE>   That base, with the help of the university, could be technology,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the university provides a skilled and educated work force,
technology companies in the area could grow, and start-ups would
spring from the talent pool, Tomasetta said. Workers in the industry
earn above-average salaries, he said, which would add wealth that
could be recycled in the community.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a janitor with a $350,000 house in Oxnard," Tomasetta
told the audience.</TE>
<TE>   But no one should expect an overnight transformation. Tomasetta
estimates it would take five to 10 years for a wider technology base
to develop from the existing tech community.</TE>
<TE>   The opening of the science building in fall 2003 is but one step
in the process, albeit an important one, members of the coalition
said.</TE>
<TE>   The red-tiled science building will have more than 31,000 square
feet with eight labs, an auditorium and 16 offices for faculty
members.</TE>

<HD>Foothill Toll Road Panel OKs Plan to Widen Bottleneck</HD>
<DH>Transit: If approved by the TCA board, the project will add
a lane to a 4-mile segment of the northbound 241.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A proposal to add a lane to the northbound Foothill toll road in
South County to help relieve congestion during peak hours was
recommended Wednesday by a key tollway committee.</LD>
<LD>   Directors for the Foothill/Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency,
who met as part of a finance committee, unanimously recommended Ortiz
Enterprises as the contractor for the $12.8-million project. The
recommendation goes to the full board next Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The area to be widened is a four-mile stretch of the 241 between
Santa Margarita and Bake parkways, which toll road officials say is a
bottleneck in the mornings and afternoons. If approved by the board,
construction is scheduled to begin in June with completion planned by
fall 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the San Joaquin toll road, which is losing money and whose
ridership is far behind projections, the Foothill toll road is
profitable, with a ridership that exceeds projections, tollway
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "During peak hours for the northbound lanes, we get about 4,600
cars or trips," said Clare Climaco, a TCA spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   The toll road handles traffic from several south Orange County
communities, including Lake Forest, Coto de Caza, Portola Hills and
Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, San Joaquin Hills toll road directors authorized a
merger with the Foothill corridor because traffic and revenue have
fallen far short of projections along the 15-mile tollway, which
stretches from Newport Beach to San Juan Capistrano. Foothill
directors are expected to take up the merger proposal next month.</TE>
<TE>   The toll road network is operated by the TCA, a joint powers
authority based in Irvine. The San Joaquin Hills, Foothill and
Eastern tollways and a short stretch of California 133 constitute the
system.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Blames Rail Line in O.C. Crash</HD>
<DH>Courts: Burlington Northern knew about risks but chose not
to install automatic braking system, the injured Metrolink conductor
claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burlington Northern Santa Fe knew about the risks of a two-train
crash but "consciously refused" to install safety systems that would
have prevented last week's deadly accident, according to a lawsuit
filed Wednesday by the conductor of a Metrolink train hit by a BNSF
freight.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Phillips suffered a brain hemorrhage in the head-on crash
that killed two passengers and injured hundreds. The suit alleges
that BNSF chose not to install an automatic braking system on its
Southern California lines "simply to save money."</LD>
<LD>   The company declined to comment on the suit. The railroad
industry--backed by federal regulators--has resisted installing the
systems, saying the $3-billion estimated cost is too high and the
technology is not refined enough to connect their entire networks.</LD>
<TE>   The freight train engineer told authorities he was blinded by the
sun and missed a yellow warning signal, failing to slow in time to
stop at a red light. The automatic brake system includes a signal
that applies brakes to trains when they hit warning lights. Officials
from the National Transportation Safety Board called it a "worst-case
scenario" crash--the kind they've been concerned about for years.</TE>
<TE>   They also said an automatic braking system would have prevented
the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips flew across the lead Metrolink car and suffered a brain
hemorrhage, said his lawyer, Santa Monica attorney Larry R. Feldman.
An MRI revealed blood on his brain, and he continues to suffer severe
headaches and double vision, Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages to cover medical
expenses, lost earnings and legal costs. But Feldman said he also
hopes it prompts change.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to try to have some good come out of this accident,"
Feldman said. "You have a rail industry, including the [BNSF], that
says this is a costly process and therefore... we are not going to
put these safety devices on.</TE>
<TE>   "The only conclusion that I think anyone can draw is that they're
saying it's cheaper to pay for all these injured people and people
who are killed or maimed than it is to put these devices on these
tracks. It's just ridiculous, and there's no excuse for it." The
automatic braking system links passenger and freight trains to
warning signals and triggers an automatic emergency stop if trains
are on a collision course.</TE>
<TE>   Only two rail lines in the United States use the braking systems:
Amtrak lines in the Northeast and in Michigan. A pilot program
testing the technology was conducted in Southern California and
involved BNSF.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Blames Rail Line in Crash</HD>
<DH>Courts: Burlington Northern knew risks but chose not to
install automatic braking system, Metrolink conductor claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Burlington Northern Santa Fe knew about the risks of a two-train
crash but "consciously refused" to install safety systems that would
have prevented last week's deadly accident, according to a lawsuit
filed Wednesday by the conductor of a Metrolink train hit by a BNSF
freight.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Phillips suffered a brain hemorrhage in the head-on crash
that killed two passengers and injured hundreds. The suit alleges
that BNSF chose not to install an automatic braking system on its
Southern California lines "simply to save money."</LD>
<LD>   The company declined to comment on the suit. The railroad
industry--backed by federal regulators--has resisted installing the
systems, saying the $3-billion estimated cost is too high and the
technology is not refined enough to connect their entire networks.</LD>
<TE>   The freight train engineer told authorities he was blinded by the
sun and missed a yellow warning signal, failing to slow in time to
stop at a red light. The automatic brake system includes a signal
that applies brakes to trains when they hit warning lights. Officials
from the National Transportation Safety Board called it a "worst-case
scenario" crash--the kind they've been concerned about for years.</TE>
<TE>   They also said an automatic braking system would have prevented
the accident.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips flew across the lead Metrolink car and suffered a brain
hemorrhage, said his lawyer, Santa Monica attorney Larry R. Feldman.
An MRI revealed blood on his brain, and he continues to suffer severe
headaches and double vision, Feldman said.</TE>
<TE>   The suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages to cover medical
expenses, lost earnings and legal costs. But Feldman said he also
hopes it prompts change.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to try to have some good come out of this accident,"
Feldman said. "You have a rail industry, including the [BNSF], that
says this is a costly process and therefore... we are not going to
put these safety devices on.</TE>
<TE>   "The only conclusion that I think anyone can draw is that they're
saying it's cheaper to pay for all these injured people and people
who are killed or maimed than it is to put these devices on these
tracks. It's just ridiculous, and there's no excuse for it." The
automatic braking system links passenger and freight trains to
warning signals and triggers an automatic emergency stop if trains
are on a collision course.</TE>
<TE>   Only two rail lines in the United States use the braking systems:
Amtrak lines in the Northeast and in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   A pilot program testing the technology was conducted in Southern
California and involved BNSF.The NTSB, which handles safety
investigations for the government but lacks regulatory authority, has
long pressured the Federal Railroad Administration to require
automatic brakes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet rail administration officials say the cost must fall before
they can force companies to use it. The rail industry hopes to create
a system compatible across all U.S. lines.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink officials said last week they also believe more
refinement is needed before automatic brake technology is ready.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a 67-year-old woman who had been dead for some time was
discovered Wednesday under piles of trash in her San Bernardino home.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators don't know how June Elizabeth Yeier died.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, after out-of-state relatives asked police to check on
her, officers went to the tiny, ramshackle house with chipped paint
and a dirt frontyard and found the front door open.</LD>
<TE>   They were unable to see much of the interior because "there was
trash wall to wall, floor to ceiling," said Police Lt. Frank Mankin.</TE>
<TE>   Police asked code enforcement officers to cart the garbage away,
and in the meantime declared Yeier missing.</TE>
<TE>   They returned Wednesday when the rooms were more accessible.</TE>
<TE>   In the late afternoon, they found Yeier's decomposing body, partly
obscured by trash, Mankin said.</TE>
<TE>   Homicide investigators brought portable lamps into the house,
which lacks electricity, and began searching for clues to her death.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said that an autopsy will be performed.</TE>

<HD>Teacher and Her Student Missing</HD>
<DH>Probe: Police say the woman, 33, and boy, 15, may have fled
to Canada together.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DIRMANN and JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 33-year-old science teacher from San Bernardino and one of her male
freshman students have been missing since Monday and may have fled
together as far as Canada, according to police.</LD>
<LD>   Tanya Hadden, a teacher at Cajon High School, and Richard Pena,
15, disappeared after police questioned the teacher Monday about
giving alcohol to several male students at a house in Rialto on April
26.</LD>
<LD>   "Tanya, please bring Richard home," the student's tearful mother,
Ida Pena, said at a news conference in front of the police station
Wednesday. "You can just drop him off; that's fine. Richard, you're
not in trouble. Don't be afraid. We just all miss you."</LD>
<TE>   Pena's parents said their son was in Hadden's first-period science
class. They said she often drove him and a carload of his friends to
their homes after school. But they never suspected any inappropriate
behavior, Ida Pena said.</TE>
<TE>   "My son just said she was very nice," said Pena, surrounded by her
husband and teenage daughters.</TE>
<TE>   But for at least the past five weeks, the pair had been having a
relationship, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Ida Pena said she took her son to school Monday morning. That
afternoon, Pena and several of his friends were contacted by a Rialto
police investigator.</TE>
<TE>   A parent had called the officer to say she believed Hadden
supplied alcohol to several of her students during a Friday night
gathering.</TE>
<TE>   After interviewing the students and Hadden, police decided to
forward the case to the district attorney to determine whether
charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor should be
filed, said Rialto Police Lt. Joe Cirilo.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time school let out Monday, Hadden and Pena were gone.</TE>
<TE>   Pena told a friend at school he was afraid to go home. He'd be in
trouble over the Rialto incident, he said. So when his mother came to
pick him up that afternoon, he never showed.</TE>
<TE>   Ida Pena said she was stunned by the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "The woman is... 30 years old," she said. "And my son is only 15."</TE>
<TE>   Police said Pena called a friend about 7:30 p.m. Monday and left a
message saying he was OK. He did not say where he was or who he was
with.</TE>
<TE>   Hadden called her family about 3 p.m. Tuesday and asked them to
feed her pets for the next several days, police said. She didn't say
where she was. Relatives said they didn't know anything about
Hadden's relationship with Pena, and that she rarely calls them.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they believe the pair may be driving to Canada in the
teacher's white, 1991, four-door Toyota Corolla, California license
plate 2XMX831.</TE>
<TE>   It is the second time this year that allegations of inappropriate
conduct between a student and a teacher have hit Cajon High School.
About two months ago, police said, another female teacher was accused
of having a relationship with a male student. But the student denied
it, and no charges were filed, San Bernardino police Lt. Frank Mankin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Principal Don Simpson, schools Supt. Arturo Delgado and the
school's spokeswoman declined to comment on the incidents, referring
all calls to the police. But stunned parents were talking Wednesday,
trying to make sense of what's been happening on their campus.</TE>
<TE>   "This is beyond belief," said Rick Medina, vice president of Cajon
High's booster club, who learned about the missing teacher and
student during a school volleyball game Wednesday. "We don't
understand why this would be happening."</TE>
<TE>   In another case, deputies in Riverside County on April 19 arrested
28-year-old Shawna Castellanos, a teacher at Redlands East Valley
High School, on suspicion of having sex with a 17-year-old student.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Castellanos hosted parties at her house in Moreno
Valley and at a hotel room in Newport Beach during spring break. Both
times, she provided alcohol to the students and had sex with the
17-year-old, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Andrews, deputy superintendent for the Redlands Unified
School District, said the teacher resigned after the investigation
began. She is awaiting trial on charges of unlawful sex with a minor
and contributing to the delinquency of minors.</TE>
<TE>   In the Hadden case, authorities asked that anyone with information
call Det. Mark Plonski at (909) 384-5619.</TE>
<TE>   "Please, son," Pena's father, Herman Pena, pleaded. "We love you.
Come home."</TE>

<HD>Recorder Used in Priest Probe</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Man who says he was molested as a boy wears
a wire when he confronts cleric.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL, RICHARD WINTON and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An alleged victim of priestly sexual abuse said Wednesday he wore a
hidden recording device to confront the cleric in an effort to help
prosecutors and detectives develop evidence against the priest.</LD>
<LD>   The move was intended to overcome statute-of-limitations problems
that could compromise prosecution in some cases of priest abuse, a
law enforcement source said. It demonstrated the difficulty
authorities face in cases in which the alleged crime is often a
decade or more old.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Griswold, 31, who asked that The Times publish his name, said
he made his story public because he is frustrated by state
statute-of-limitation laws and the possibility that his complaint
against an Azusa priest won't be prosecuted.</LD>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Wednesday that
Griswold's allegation against Father David Granadino, who until
recently worked at St. Frances of Rome Catholic Church, is one of 18
investigations of 16 Catholic priests involving about 50 victims. It
was the first accounting by the Sheriff's Department. The Los Angeles
Police Department has said it is investigating 50 allegations of
priestly abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Dan Scott of the department's Family Crimes Bureau said some
of the cases stem from years-old allegations and that some could fall
victim to statute-of-limitations laws.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on cases
involving most types of molestation of children 15 and younger.
However, prosecutors can pursue these older cases if they have "clear
and convincing" contemporary corroborating evidence. Examples include
additional victims, a confession, letters or diaries--and evidence of
substantial sexual conduct, Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   In Griswold's case, Scott said, no decision has been made about
whether to move ahead with criminal charges. However, sheriff's
officials were privately upset that an alleged victim had taken his
case to the media before they completed the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Griswold, a Norwalk resident, told sheriff's investigators in
December that he had been sexually abused by the priest beginning
when he was 13 and continuing into his early 20s. Detectives also are
investigating allegations by two others against Granadino that
allegedly occurred beginning more than 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department opened a second investigation into sexual
abuse accusations against Granadino in March, after an alleged victim
reported the abuse to the Los Angeles Archdiocese's hotline.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has said he moved Granadino from St.
Frances of Rome after that anonymous allegation was made. Sheriff's
detectives have interviewed about 100 children and adults in that
probe.</TE>
<TE>   When the allegations became public, Granadino was transferred to a
retreat at an abbey south of Palmdale. Detectives say they have not
interviewed the priest, and they say his attorney has told them he
has "relocated" from the abbey to an undisclosed location.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said they were unsure when the archdiocese was
notified about the December allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the archdiocese was cooperating with the Sheriff's
Department, Scott said he had "no comment."</TE>
<TE>   Granadino, who is also a Sheriff's Department chaplain, has
"forcefully denied any misconduct," according to an exchange of
e-mails by top archdiocese officials. His attorney, Don Steier, said,
"Father Granadino is upset, but more upset for what is going on in
his parish than for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Scott would not confirm the contents of the recording Griswold
made but added, "We aren't going to deny what the victim said about
helping us."</TE>
<TE>   Griswold, who conducted media interviews in the Irvine office of
attorney Katherine K. Freberg, said he wore a small tape
recorder--disguised as a pager--while meeting with Granadino in the
rectory of St. Frances of Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Griswold said he began the short conversation with the priest by
saying, "I'm trying to understand some things that happened in the
past."</TE>
<TE>   He said he went on to detail some alleged molestations and the
priest replied: "It's not your fault."</TE>
<TE>   Griswold said he didn't remember the priest apologizing, but
recalled the priest saying more than once, "It's not your fault. It's
my fault."</TE>
<TE>   He said he made contact with the police Dec. 10, before a national
sex abuse scandal erupted in Catholic parishes across the country.
Griswold said he came forward after receiving "a gift from God" that
told him to make sure other children would not be molested.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally realized what [Granadino] did was wrong," Griswold
said. "It was time. I didn't want any other kids to be hurt."</TE>
<TE>   Griswold said his father died when he was 7, and when he was a
young teen, Granadino, then a priest at St. John of God Catholic
Church in Norwalk, became like a second father to him. He said the
priest took him to dinners, movies and on overnight trips.</TE>
<TE>   Griswold said the relationship continued even after Granadino was
transferred to parishes in Pacific Palisades and Azusa.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me, 'You're my godson,'" Griswold said. "He told me that
he loved me. My father wasn't around. He definitely filled the father
void. I just didn't understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials and prosecutors would not comment on whether
Griswold's case would be harmed by the disclosure of the recording
device. Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Steve Katz, who works
in the sex crimes unit, said prosecutors won't discuss the case until
they decide whether to press charges.</TE>
<TE>   The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has forwarded the names of at least
eight priests removed from the ministry this spring to police as well
as several others reported to its hotline.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Mahony and the archdiocese were named in two
racketeering lawsuits filed by four men who allege that they were
molested as boys by the Rev. Carl Sutphin.</TE>
<TE>   They allege church officials promised to remove Sutphin from the
church in 1991, but instead transferred him to the new downtown
cathedral before forcing him to retire recently.</TE>

<HD>Wiseburn Schools Secession Plan Clears a Hurdle, but
There's a Catch</HD>

<LD>A county agency Wednesday supported a proposal to allow a small South
Bay elementary school district to form its own high school and break
away from the Centinela Valley Union High School District.</LD>
<LD>   But one of the agency's recommendations to the state--which has
final say over the matter--will make the split more difficult to get
past voters.</LD>
<LD>   Because a Wiseburn Elementary School District split would raise
taxes in three other cities, the County Committee on School District
Organization recommended that all voters within the Centinela Valley
district, and not just those in Wiseburn, be able to vote on the
secession issue once the state approves the proposal.</LD>
<TE>   Secession supporters were concerned that a districtwide vote would
be a major blow to their campaign because it might prompt voters in
other elementary districts to oppose their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Some committee members acknowledged that a districtwide vote would
make a Wiseburn break more difficult, but said the fairest thing to
do was to allow all those affected by Wiseburn's unification have a
vote.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go with the whole district [vote], I can tell you right
now, we can probably just forget it," said committee member John
Nunez, who opposed the entire proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's point of contention is a $59-million bond measure
that Centinela Valley homeowners and businesses repay through a tax
on their property's assessed value. Property owners in the four
elementary districts that feed into the Centinela Valley
district--Wiseburn, Hawthorne, Lennox and Lawndale--pay about $15 a
year for every $100,000 in property value.</TE>
<TE>   The Wiseburn district, which makes up about 40% of the area's
assessed property value and includes corporations such as Boeing and
Xerox, pays a large chunk of that bond measure. If Wiseburn breaks
away, Hawthorne, Lennox and Lawndale are left with the rest of the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report prepared by the Los Angeles County Office of
Education, Centinela Valley voters would pay an extra $10 per
$100,000 of assessed property value if the Wiseburn district were to
split away now. That figure, however, could rise to $75 per $100,000
in assessed valuation as Centinela Valley continues to spend the
$59-million bond.</TE>
<TE>   But proponents of the Wiseburn K-12 district say the tax increase
is minimal and are confident that the other elementary school
districts would support them in their efforts to create smaller,
safer schools.</TE>
<TE>   With only about 6,500 of the 54,000 registered voters in the
Centinela Valley district, Wiseburn cannot do this alone.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking $25 a year when most people in the area are
interested in breaking up a district which has been unresponsive to
the needs of the community," said John Peterson, a secession backer.</TE>
<TE>   Nilo Michelin, a member of the Hawthorne School Board and
organizer of that district's own K-12 unification effort, said he
would like to discuss the effects Wiseburn's unification plans would
have on his district.</TE>
