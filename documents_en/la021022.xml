<LD>Ellen Burstyn will star in "The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells
All," a stage adaptation of the Allan Gurganus novel, opening at the
Old Globe Theatre in San Diego on Feb. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The theater's artistic director, Jack O'Brien, said a Broadway run
for Martin Tahse's adaptation of the story of a Confederate captain's
wife is in the works. The play is almost a solo show, but a young
actor also will be on stage in a supporting capacity, O'Brien said.</LD>
<LD>   The Globe also announced the premieres of Stephen Metcalfe's
"Loves &amp; Hours," which O'Brien will stage, on March 29, and Andrea
Stolowitz's "Knowing Cairo" on April 5, plus the U.S. premiere of Abi
Morgan's "Splendour" on Feb. 8 and a production of David Edgar's
"Pentecost" on May 31.</LD>

<HD>Creed is all apologies as it rocks without originality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Stapp wants your forgiveness. Earlier this month, the singer's
throat problems caused Creed to postpone a Staples Center concert
only hours before show time. And that concert had already been
rescheduled from a May cancellation.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you guys for waiting," Stapp said near the beginning of
Creed's concert Sunday at Staples, and fans cheered in response. "I
can feel the energy in this room."</LD>
<LD>   He would express gracious thanks again at the end of the
100-minute performance, but he really didn't need to be so apologetic
-- the band still enjoys a cushion of massive popularity, fueled by
the multi-platinum sales of its most recent album, "Weathered."</LD>
<TE>   Not much has changed with the band since its 1997 debut, although
the influences are better hidden now.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Vedder remains the model of choice for Stapp, strutting and
crouching down a catwalk set deep into Sunday's crowd as the band
ignited a blend of hard rock and confessional lyrics.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where we become one," he announced at one point, holding
the microphone out to the crowd, once again embracing the messianic
side of rock stardom, following a tradition that stretches from
Robert Plant to Lenny Kravitz.</TE>
<TE>   Stapp is often the target of scorn for Creed's obnoxious
unoriginality, but guitarist Mark Tremonti is equally to blame, with
sludgy riffs that are often anonymous and repetitive. His brief solo
for "With Arms Wide Open" somehow veered off, as if from another
song, another band -- this one maybe led by Peter Frampton.</TE>
<TE>   Creed could occasionally land a stirring hard-rock riff. Tremonti
picked out an exotic pattern for "Say I," a song that rocked hard but
was ultimately empty, not unlike the songs of Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's Got My Back" and "One Last Breath" were stretched-out
epics, with searching lyrics and crunchy chords, but too long and
again reaching too hard for profundity. Some things you just can't
forgive.</TE>

<HD>A desperate bid to avoid 'average'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bernadette Murphy</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Margaret and Letty, educated, resourceful urban women in their
mid-30s -- best friends since childhood -- feel the weight of the
years passing, with only meager accomplishments to show. Time, they
believe, is running out in "All Is Vanity," an enthralling, satirical
novel by Christina Schwarz ("Drowning Ruth").</LD>
<LD>   Both women know instinctively they're not mediocre people awash in
a sea of humanity: They're special. Cloaked in incisive wit, the
novel is a tragedy in the classic sense.</LD>
<LD>   Margaret, living in New York, quits her job teaching English to
write the great American novel, certain that a year off work will
transform her into a literary success. Letty, a West Los Angeles
mother of four small children, thinks that if she can keep pace with
the upper-middle-class families of her social circuit -- the right
haircuts for the kids, the right house -- she'll be the stunning wife
and mother she was meant to be.</LD>
<TE>   Almost immediately, Margaret hits the agonizing reality of novel
writing, and her ensuing struggle with writer's block is utterly
hilarious. Instead of putting words on the page, she decides to paint
the walls of her rented apartment; next, she sands down her
bookcases, then paints the window sills, confident that once the
place looks just-so, the muse will take.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz uses laugh-out-loud insight into the writer's mind to
illustrate Margaret's struggle. Determined to write a character who's
a Vietnam vet, for instance, Margaret decides to reread Tim O'Brien
for inspiration.</TE>
<TE>   The two women write lengthy e-mails to one another, and in Letty's
struggles to keep up with the California mom-hipster-cool model,
Margaret finds, at last, her muse. She begins to write Letty's life
as thinly veiled fiction, using the e-mails and childhood letters
Letty wrote her.</TE>
<TE>   When Letty's husband gets a lucrative job at a wealthy museum
foundation, her standard of living rises dramatically, along with her
desires. She remodels the kitchen and then sells the house to buy a
bigger, more prestigious one. She throws extravagant parties and
extends her family's finances beyond the breaking point.</TE>
<TE>   After years of struggle, she's entitled, she tells herself.
Margaret encourages Letty's skewed perspective, urging her to go
further with her plans, because the more Letty's financial
circumstances deteriorate, the better Margaret's plot becomes.</TE>
<TE>   At heart, Schwarz's novel depicts the narcissistic flair in
contemporary society: No one can stand to be average. We all think we
deserve the best, yet obtaining it fails to address the emptiness
inside. Describing an outrageously expensive party she threw, Letty
writes to Margaret: "I thought the evening would be different
somehow. I thought, first of all, that I would be different. More
witty, more gracious. But I was just the same, hiding behind
'Swordfish-and-mango-salsa-in-a-blue-corn-tortilla-cup?' "</TE>
<TE>   Schwarz's keen work portrays a tormenting reality: We may come to
understand that all is vanity, yet usually we're helpless to shift
course. When Margaret realizes that drafting a novel is not as easy
as she had imagined, she digs through childhood writings, certain
she'll find evidence of incipient genius to help her back on track.</TE>
<TE>   What she finds instead is "at best precocity and at worst
self-conscious straining. Had I been, after all, only an overachiever
type, who, in fact, had not managed even to overachieve?" Armed with
this knowledge, she's unable to let go of her literary aspirations.
She'll just have to make up with willpower what she lacks in talent.</TE>
<TE>   Letty, meanwhile, on the verge of bankruptcy, considers selling
the expensive real estate. "This house, its neighborhood, even the
renovations we'd begun ... made us the people I wanted us to be," she
laments. "With these accoutrements, we had clearly succeeded in life.
Without them, we had failed." Still, Letty cannot relinquish the
image she's created, even if this tenacity will spell her downfall.</TE>
<TE>   In this funny yet touching tale, Schwarz deftly delineates the
tragedy of the human condition. When it comes to overthrowing egotism
and the green-eyed monster of envy, there's a bit of Letty's
covetousness and Margaret's rash ambition in us all.</TE>
<TE>   Self-knowledge, in the long run, avails us nothing.</TE>

<KH>THE BIG PICTURE PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</KH>
<HD>It's time to get inside Oscar's little golden head</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though the academy nominations won't be announced until Feb.11
-- the awards themselves are March 23 -- Oscar season arrives early,
like winter in North Dakota. It may be too soon to convince the White
House that the Earth is in the grip of global warming, but it's never
too early for Hollywood pundits to toss around Oscar plaudits.</LD>
<LD>   As far back as April, barely weeks after the maintenance crews had
cleaned up the debris outside the Kodak Theatre from the last Oscar
telecast, Liz Smith was touting Diane Lane's Oscar chances for her
"astonishing work in 'Unfaithful.' " This summer, Fox411.com
columnist Roger Friedman was doing the same for the
yet-to-be-released "Frida," saying, "We'll be seeing Salma Hayek at
the Oscars."</LD>
<TE>   No movie is too obscure or too awful to be left out. Columnist
Marilyn Beck predicted accolades for the bomb "The Four Feathers,"
trumpeting that it "has Oscar gold written all over it." Wireless
Magazine's Earl Dittman is rooting for "White Oleander," saying it
"has Oscar written all over it." Newsweek's Devin Gordon had "Oscar
buzz already mounting" for "Tadpole" co-star Bebe Neuwirth just
before her movie disappeared off the face of the Earth. And Newhouse
News Service critic Bob Campbell was such a fan of "The Banger
Sisters" that he suggested that "the Motion Picture Academy will have
to come up with some special two-headed joined-at-the-hip award in
recognition of what Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon pull off."</TE>
<TE>   With the hype machine in high gear, it's time to open my own
betting window and offer the early line on this year's best-picture
winner. The predictions are based on early viewings of the films as
well as conversations with studio marketers and other industry
experts. At this stage, the handicapping is all about perception and
pedigree -- many of the leading contenders won't be released until
the final weeks of the year.</TE>
<TE>   However, judging from the films that have been playing the
festival circuit, there could be a wider gulf than ever between the
shoo-ins for critic Top 10 lists -- which so far include Paul Thomas
Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love," Alexander Payne's "About Schmidt,"
Spike Jonze's "Adaptation," Alphonso Cuaron's "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and
Todd Haynes' "Far From Heaven" -- and the films that will appeal to
conservative academy members.</TE>
<TE>   Judging from my research, while there are already plenty of sure
things in the actor categories, this promises to be a wide-open race
for best picture. A reminder: These predictions are far from
infallible. Last year, my two favorites were "A Beautiful Mind,"
which took the lead in the first turn and went on to win, and "Ali,"
which stumbled out of the gate and was never in the race.</TE>
<TE>   Favorites:</TE>
<TE>   "Chicago." (5-1). Five years ago, a musical might have been an
Oscar longshot, but this Rob Marshall-directed film should benefit
from Baz Luhrmann's consciousness-raising campaign last year that
persuaded academy members that such musicals as "Moulin Rouge!" were
Oscar fare. It doesn't hurt that "Chicago" is about Hollywood's
favorite subject -- show business. With brassy performances by Renee
Zellweger and Richard Gere, great music and lots of stylish
filmmaking, this is classic academy fare. "Chicago" will also benefit
from Miramax's Oscar clout now that the film has taken over from
"Gangs of New York" as the studio's thoroughbred entry.</TE>
<TE>   * "Road to Perdition." (8-1): Never count out an early favorite
from a studio (DreamWorks) that's had a hand in the last three
winners. Like the last two winners, "Perdition" comes in with solid
box-office credentials and respectful reviews, although people seem
more underwhelmed by the film now than when it first arrived in
theaters. Still, it's packed with pedigree: Director Sam Mendes won
his last time out with "American Beauty," and Tom Hanks, a two-time
winner, and Paul Newman, an eight-time nominee, are academy
mainstays. The down side: Since "The Godfather" epics, no gangster
saga has been a best-picture winner.</TE>
<TE>   Contenders:</TE>
<TE>   * "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers." (10-1): Even sight
unseen, this film is a formidable contender, being the only adventure
epic with box-office clout in the field. Peter Jackson's first
"Rings" movie (a best-picture nominee) benefited from its underdog
status -- it was the anti-"Harry Potter." Being a sequel is a tough
Oscar assignment: The bar will be higher the second time around.</TE>
<TE>   * "Antwone Fisher." (12-1): Earnest and full of crowd-pleasing
soul, this inspired-by-real-life story of a man's search for his
family -- and himself -- has all the ingredients of an academy
sentimental favorite. It sidesteps the pitfalls of a traditional
biopic, since Fisher -- who faced abuse as a child in the foster care
system -- is the screenwriter of record. It also benefits from having
Denzel Washington, coming off an Oscar win, as director and co-star:
Actors-turned-directors have won best picture for a slew of films,
including "Braveheart" (Mel Gibson), "Unforgiven" (Clint Eastwood),
"Dances With Wolves" (Kevin Costner), "Gandhi" (Richard Attenborough)
and "Ordinary People" (Robert Redford).</TE>
<TE>   * "About Schmidt." (14-1): The critics adore this Alexander
Payne-directed portrait of a widowed insurance executive's quest for
meaning in his life, and having academy favorite Jack Nicholson
offering a lion-in-winter performance in the lead will only increase
this picture's Oscar appeal. The film is probably too sly and
downbeat to be much of a commercial success, but glowing reviews
would make it a good bet to be this year's "In the Bedroom" entry.</TE>
<TE>   * "Far From Heaven." (15-1): Of the other critics' favorites, this
Todd Haynes-directed homage to Douglas Sirk has the highest Oscar
hopes. Many voters will find it too arch and emotionally remote, but
it comes armed with great film festival buzz from Venice and Toronto,
a stand-out performance by Julianne Moore and lots of cinematic
razzle dazzle. In Hollywood, having a major gay character may also be
a plus, since it accentuates the film's exploration of prejudice and
tolerance in 1950s America.</TE>
<TE>   * The Hours." (16-1): With Nicole Kidman (with a prosthetic
schnoz), Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore all on board, director
Stephen Daldry's adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about
Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway" exudes high-brow class, which always
counts with academy voters. But for all its technical polish, early
viewers were mixed on some of the performances and felt the film
lacked the emotional wallop it would need to land in best-picture
territory.</TE>
<TE>   Longshots:</TE>
<TE>   * "Gangs of New York." (30-1). This long-delayed Martin Scorsese
film was 20-1 last year, but the $100-million-plus movie's prospects
have dimmed after taking a beating in the press, especially after
word leaked out that Scorsese replaced longtime collaborator,
composer Elmer Bernstein, with Howard Shore. There's still talk of a
great performance from Daniel Day Lewis, but press reaction to early
footage was muted.</TE>
<TE>   * "The Pianist." (32-1): The early reviews have been mixed about
this Roman Polanski-directed drama about a Jewish musician (Adrien
Brody) trapped in wartime Warsaw, but when it comes to the academy,
never count out a movie about the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   The movie won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and coming from Polanski,
a child of the Holocaust, the film has a potent emotional hook with
voters that could overwhelm its dramatic limitations.</TE>
<TE>   * "Minority Report." (35-1): Even with Steven Spielberg at the
helm, this movie was more admired than loved, making it more of a
craft category entry. The academy likes sci-fi even less than comedy.
Films like this, with a pessimistic view of the future ("Blade
Runner," "A.I."), rarely even get nominated.</TE>
<TE>   * "Signs" and "Insomnia." (40-1): If the other big studio entries
falter, one of these films, which are armed with top actors and
Oscar-nominated writer-directors (M. Night Shyamalan and Christopher
Nolan) could get a second look and sneak into the fifth best-picture
slot.</TE>
<TE>   * "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." (45-1) Golden Globes, yes; Oscars,
no. Despite its unlikely box-office triumph, it's a confection, not a
main course. The snobbish academy is impressed by British theater
actors, not a popcorn movie helmed by a sitcom director.</TE>

<HD>Can Laura Diaz rescue KCBS?</HD>
<DH>An aggressive bilingual ad campaign places the popular
anchor at the forefront of the No. 3 station's ratings battle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>TV news anchor Laura Diaz calls it "a true Carrie Bradshaw moment."</LD>
<LD>   There she was, on camera and reporting from downtown Los Angeles
recently, when three buses passed, each featuring her
larger-than-life portrait and the announcement that she would soon be
"making news."</LD>
<LD>   "It was just so surreal," Diaz said, amused at her real-life echo
of the opening credits for "Sex and the City," in which Carrie
Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) gets splashed by a passing bus with
her picture on it.</LD>
<TE>   Diaz, who joined KCBS-TV as its most prominent anchor in August
after spending almost two decades at KABC-TV's "Eyewitness News," had
better get used to that kind of surreal moment.</TE>
<TE>   Around L.A., it's nearly impossible to avoid seeing Diaz smiling
from billboards, bus placards or posters. The campaign announcing her
arrival at KCBS is one of the most aggressive ever to herald a local
anchor.</TE>
<TE>   Notably, some of the billboards are in Spanish. Ads also have run
on Spanish-language radio as well as in the Spanish-language
newspaper La Opinion. Diaz and fellow anchor Harold Greene rode in
the recent Mexican Independence Day parade in East Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive bilingual campaign is one of the few instances in
which an English-language station has specifically targeted Latino
viewers. It has drawn barbs from rival news directors and executives,
although none would speak on the record about their contention that
KCBS is trying to turn Diaz into a celebrity more important than the
news she is delivering.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it's insulting," said one news director at a rival
station. "It should be about content." The executive also pointed out
that Diaz's official debut Sept. 3 was overshadowed by continuous
coverage of a huge blaze in the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "They said she would be making news, and you barely saw her," said
the news director.</TE>
<TE>   An executive at another rival station said, "It's a fallacy that
viewers follow an anchor from one station to another. They just
don't. Viewers' loyalties are built around stations. They don't
travel."</TE>
<TE>   However, the head of yet another station said the campaign makes
sense. "I really don't blame KCBS for marketing her in this way,"
said the executive. "She is extremely popular."</TE>
<TE>   Though excited about the campaign, Diaz said she hopes viewers and
others will keep the situation in perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't involved in the direction of this campaign," she said.
"I'm very pleased that there is this warm welcome. But I don't think
it was about me being more important than the news. It was just
trying to point out that I had been at one station for a long time,
and I elected to cross the street to go somewhere else. It was just
saying, 'Hey, look at us.' "</TE>
<TE>   She added, "It's true that you didn't see much of me that first
day. The pictures were more important. It's the capriciousness of the
business."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, a California native who grew up in Santa Clarita, has won
three Los Angeles-area Emmys and received an L.A. Press Club
spot-news award for her coverage of the 1992 L.A. riots.</TE>
<TE>   Her growing celebrity status is taking some adjustment.</TE>
<TE>   "For most of my career, I've just flown under the radar," she
said. "Sometimes in life, when there is a major transition, people
perceive you differently. But I'm the same. And I'm wrapping my arms
around this new opportunity. People can criticize this campaign if
they want to, but everywhere I went, people were asking me, 'Why did
you leave KABC? What are you going to do?' "</TE>
<TE>   The campaign is the highest-profile component in putting forth
Diaz as KCBS' most valuable asset. Her hiring, coupled with the
station's recent merger with KCAL-TV, is seen as key to helping turn
around KCBS, which has traditionally trailed its rivals KNBC-TV and
KABC-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Don Corsini, general manager of the two stations, has called Diaz
the "cornerstone" of the merged stations. His goal is to "assemble a
news operation of unprecedented scale, with the best-known
journalists in the city. We want to create the most respected news
operation."</TE>
<TE>   The verdict on Diaz's drawing power and the campaign's
effectiveness is not in yet. Ratings for the 5 p.m. news, which she
anchors with Greene, her former "Eyewitness News" partner, are still
lackluster. But Corsini said viewership for the station's 11 p.m.
newscast has jumped 25% since she started. Part of that boost is
attributable to CBS' prime-time performance, particularly on Mondays
with the new hit "CSI: Miami."</TE>
<TE>   "Our focus is that we really have to take it one step at a time,
and our priority is to get back in the game at 11 p.m.," Corsini
said. That newscast has long trailed its rivals at KNBC-TV and
KABC-TV. "The network's success leading into the late news will help
us create a platform of success. Hopefully we can make Monday night a
winning habit that can function as a springboard for the rest of the
week."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz echoed Corsini's sentiment. "We know this is going to be a
challenging road. "We're proud of the progress we've made, and we
will continue to work on it."</TE>
<TE>   Key to attracting a larger audience is attracting more minority
viewers, Corsini said.</TE>
<TE>   "KCBS skews Caucasian," he said, noting that more than half of the
station's daytime audience is white. "That needs to change. KCBS has
not done a great job of community outreach in general. It just has
not been a priority of this station. One of our clearest goals is to
be actively involved with the community. It is at the top of my mind.</TE>
<TE>   "Laura is one of the top anchors in Los Angeles. It was a real
coup to get her to come here. The fact that she is Hispanic is an
added plus."</TE>
<TE>   The Diaz campaign will be expanded soon to include more of the
news team. How successful the promotion has been in drawing Latino
viewers is unclear. Figures won't be available until the detailed
demographic information gathered during November sweeps is released
in December.</TE>
<TE>   Said Diaz: "I realize my hopes and dreams have been embraced by
many in the Latino community. It's my responsibility to embrace that.
But I'm always a journalist first. I have never led with my
ethnicity. It's part of who I am, but what I really bring to this job
is my years in the marketplace and my commitment to journalism."</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is a bit of fun attached to her increased visibility.
Diaz said she and a group of friends, including colleague Linda
Breakstone, recently drove to take a look at a Diaz billboard on
Sunset Boulevard. They noticed a commotion in front of a club near
the billboard, saw police responding and called for a crew so they
could file a live report from the scene.</TE>
<TE>   "There I was, trying to interview people, and they would look up
at the billboard and say, 'Hey, that's you,' " recalled Diaz with a
laugh. "Now that is an L.A. moment."</TE>

<HD>Forgers pitching a fast one to the unsuspecting</HD>
<DH>'They're a shameless bunch of people who don't have any
trouble sleeping at night.' James Spence Sports autograph expert</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J. Michael Kennedy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hockey great Cam Neely remembers the time a few years back when he
walked into an Atlanta sports bar and was told that one of his
jerseys held a place of honor on the wall. Not only that, it was one
he'd autographed.</LD>
<LD>   There was only one problem: Neely had never signed it.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Halper, a minority owner of the New York Yankees, who at one
time owned the best sports memorabilia collection in the world, tells
this story: He was approached by a man who wanted to sell him a
letter from Lou Gehrig, one of baseball's greatest players. Halper
took one look and knew it was a fake. The letterhead contained a ZIP
Code that wasn't introduced until 1963, more than 20 years after
Gehrig's death. And if any more evidence were needed, Gehrig
purportedly wrote that he believed the Yankees would repeat as
winners of the American League East, which didn't even exist at the
time.</LD>
<TE>   Autograph forgery, even when done badly, is a crime so pervasive
in sports and entertainment that the odds of getting a genuine
signature make blackjack look like a sure thing. There are so many
Tiger Woods forgeries out there, for instance, that the chance of
getting a real signature is now put at 1 in 10.</TE>
<TE>   In days gone by, when autographs had little value, forgery was a
rarity. But now that a signature can sell for thousands of dollars,
the crooks have moved in and made a shambles of the market. The
advice experts give is to eyeball the autograph being signed. If
unsure, presume a signature is a fake until it's proved otherwise.
And if something seems too good to be true, think forgery. Don't
think you're getting a deal spending $500 on a baseball autographed
by Babe Ruth; the going rate for an authentic one in mint condition
is more than $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a shameless bunch of people who don't have any trouble
sleeping at night," James Spence, a leading expert in sports
autographs, said of forgers.</TE>
<TE>   And as much as forgeries have taken over in sports collecting, the
Hollywood end of the business is even more cluttered with fakes. "The
big celebrities, they don't do signings," said FBI agent Tim
Fitzsimmons. "But if you go online, you can get any big celebrity you
want in any quantity. It's all bad."</TE>
<TE>   At one time, autographs were collected by children and die-hard
fans, people willing to wait for hours to get a signature on a
program or a scrap of paper. But in the last 20 years, all that has
changed as the sports autograph business alone has burgeoned into a
$500-million industry. And the main driving force is the Internet,
where millions of trading cards and memorabilia are sold.</TE>
<TE>   Huge online volume</TE>
<TE>   On EBay, the online auction house, about 350,000 trading cards are
put up for bid each week. That does not include the thousands of
other items with signatures on them. With that kind of volume,
policing is a near-impossible nightmare. Realizing its reputation was
suffering as it became a major marketplace for forgeries, EBay
recently signed a deal with Professional Sports Authenticators, a
company based in Newport Beach, aimed at giving collectors a fighting
chance. For a $7.49 fee, the company will deliver an opinion within
36 hours about whether a signature is probably good or probably fake,
but with no guarantees. The buyer is still on his own when it comes
to making a decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to arm people with the knowledge and power to make
an intelligent decision," said EBay's John Fitch, who heads the
auction house's trading card and memorabilia division. EBay wouldn't
disclose dollar figures for autographs sold but projected that all
sports-related sales this year would come to $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Trading-card manufacturer Upper Deck has taken a different
approach to guaranteeing signature authenticity. When a star athlete
under contract to the company does a signing, the entire session is
filmed on what the company calls a pen-cam. The small camera attached
to a pen records the signing. The buyer gets a CD-ROM of the actual
autograph session, complete with a permanent digital date and time
stamp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the real McCoy," said Upper Deck spokeswoman Mary Macera.
"What we always recommend is that if you can meet an athlete face to
face, go for it. If you can't do that, then you really have to be
smart about what you're buying."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, say the experts, most people are downright ignorant
when it comes to buying signatures of their favorite athletes or
movie stars. Many are happy with a certificate of authenticity, which
often isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Others simply take it on
faith that a signature is genuine, even though the odds are against
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the willingness of people to believe that's so incredible,"
said forgery expert Kenneth Rendell, whose book, "Forging History:
The Detection of Fake Letters and Documents," is considered one of
the best on the subject.</TE>
<TE>   Or as Philadelphia autograph dealer Steven Raab put it: "This has
brought scads of disreputable people onto the scene. You can make a
great living selling forged autographs."</TE>
<TE>   While fake autographs are a big business, dealers complain that
the crime is generally ignored by most law enforcement agencies
because, taken individually, most forgeries are small potatoes. The
only major autograph bust came in 1999, when the FBI ran what was
known as Operation Bullpen, led by Fitzsimmons, based in San Diego.
Forty people were arrested and charged in the case, whose evidence
included recordings of forgers laughing as they signed bogus names on
various sports paraphernalia. Tom Kramer, owner of Golden Age
Autographs in New York, said one of the problems is that with new
technology it's almost impossible to tell the fake from the real.
Kramer, who specializes in vintage Hollywood photos, said forgers can
shoot a picture of a real signature, overlay it on a photo and then
expertly trace the name.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to prove that a lot of this material is fake
because it looks so good," he said. "One rule for dealers is that if
you see something that you've never seen before and it looks a little
too good to be true, you're going to pause and look more closely."</TE>
<TE>   Added to this mix is the fact that Hollywood stars often have a
battery of assistants whose job is to sign celebrity photos and send
them to fans. Los Angeles autograph expert Chuck Sachs said that at
any given time, for instance, actor Clint Eastwood has several
secretaries on hand who can imitate his autograph.</TE>
<TE>   "What do I do when I see Clint Eastwood material?" he asked. "I
head for the hills."</TE>
<TE>   Rendell agreed: "People have to have a suspension of disbelief to
be buying movie stars. Do they really think they sit around signing
this stuff?"</TE>
<TE>   One other culprit of signature authenticity is the autopen, the
automated device often used by heads of state and other dignitaries
to sign thousands of documents that come with the job. The trouble
is, it doesn't count as the real thing in the autograph world.
Washington signature expert Edward Bomsey said one of the most common
autographs people take to him is that of John F. Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety-nine times out of a 100 it's a secretary's signature or a
machine signature," he said. "People have kept these items like they
are a sacred relic. When they bring them in for appraisal, it breaks
your heart."</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy also figured in a 1997 hoax in which forged documents
purported to prove the former president had an affair with actress
Marilyn Monroe, then paid her mother $600,000 in hush money. One of
the proofs of forgery was that the typewriter used to compose the
documents didn't come on the market until eight years after Kennedy's
death.</TE>
<TE>   While such bumbling does happen, forgers have proved themselves to
be a crafty lot. They have been known to create their own ink so that
it appears aged. A New Hampshire man was recently arrested for
cutting out the pages of antique books, then using the blank areas to
forge signatures of old time stars and sports figures. That way, the
age of the paper matched the era of the supposed signer. More often
than not, such a forged signature is then lavishly framed, complete
with a picture of the celebrity, giving it an aura of authenticity.</TE>
<TE>   An infamous forger</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes forgeries rise from the dead after being out of
circulation for generations. The most recent dupe occurred in May at
a Philadelphia auction house that was selling manuscripts attributed
to Francis Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence.</TE>
<TE>   But the material had to be pulled when it was discovered that it
was the work of infamous forger "Baron" Charles B. Weisberg, who died
in prison in 1945. The forgeries were found in a forgotten basement
box and were then authenticated as real. Only at the last minute did
the auction house realize they were forged by Weisberg, known for his
skilled fakes of Stephen Foster manuscripts as well as the letters of
Lincoln and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The question of authenticity made the news last summer after
Boston Red Sox slugger Ted Williams died. Shortly after his death, a
smudged note bearing Williams' signature requested that the baseball
great be preserved cryonically. The note, also signed by Williams'
son, John Henry, and daughter, Claudia, caused much speculation in
autograph circles that the signature could be a forgery because it
contradicted Williams' 1996 will.</TE>
<TE>   So what's to be done? Spence said education is the first priority;
knowing, for instance, that a newer brand of baseball couldn't have
been signed by a long-dead player. "A lot of forgers don't know
anything about the history of baseball," said Spence. "They're just
opportunists."</TE>
<TE>   He also said buyers should try to pay by credit card because
redress is sometimes possible if fraud is discovered. Finally, he
said there should be an expert authentication, with the buyer paying
the fee if the item is authentic, the seller paying if it's a fraud.
And, Spence said, if the seller balks, don't buy.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's Fitzsimmons said one of the most important things is to
know the history, or provenance, of a signature and not take
certificates of authentication as sufficient proof. "They just print
those certificates," he said. "The provenance is more important."</TE>

<LD>The ancient Chinese made ceramic sculptures of people and animals
from everyday life to include in their burials. This funerary
sculpture of a Bactrian camel dates to the Tang Dynasty more than
1,000 years ago. It is modeled after the camel caravans that passed
along the ancient Silk Road, where goods were traded with foreigners
from as far away as Rome.</LD>
<LD>   Two-humped Bactrian camels came from the ancient kingdom of
Bactria in modern Afghanistan. They were ideal animals to cross the
vast distances of the Silk Road, which included long stretches of
desert. They could store water in their humps for long periods of
time. They were also able to anticipate sandstorms, burying their
heads, giving traders valuable time to protect themselves.</LD>

<HD>Good Morning, Afghanistan: Robin Williams visits the troops</HD>
<DH>The comic mixes small shows with time for photos with
soldiers -- a typical trip for today's military entertainers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael A. Lev</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan -- Robin Williams came here to entertain
the troops. Most of his jokes cannot be repeated, but not because
they contained military secrets.</LD>
<LD>   That, at least, jibes with the World War II-era stereotype of a
traveling USO show. But the rest of Williams' visit showed how much
some things have changed.</LD>
<LD>   During one colorful performance at a supply depot at Bagram, the
main U.S. base in Afghanistan, Williams accidentally soaked Pfc.
Krystal Heard of Maywood, Ill., with water.</LD>
<TE>   "Uh, oh," Williams said as the crowd roared with laughter. "I'm
sorry for spraying you, girl. Don't go Oprah on me."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it was the fact that no alcohol is permitted on base, or
that most soldiers here are somewhere deep in the middle of a six- to
nine-month-long assignment, or simply that the troops were happy to
escape the swirling Afghan dust for a few minutes, but Williams'
appearances were a major hit.</TE>
<TE>   He spent several days in Afghanistan, leaving Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' handlers said he would not answer questions from the
media and insisted that he not be photographed with soldiers holding
guns, which was a little tricky since the basic dress code for
soldiers in a war zone mandates that they carry rifles.</TE>
<TE>   But Williams was extremely warm and friendly, repeating numerous
times in show-biz fashion how happy he was to be here, even though
this was Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He even did a version of the comedian's classic "I just flew in
from out of town ..." line.</TE>
<TE>   "The C-17 is a great plane ... if you're already deaf," he said,
referring to the military's noisy cargo and passenger carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Other subjects Williams riffed on included: Osama bin Laden,
President Bush, military haircuts, the dust and, for some reason,
golf.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here at the third hole of the Afghan Open," he whispered
into his microphone in golf-announcer fashion. "We can't play the
10th hole, because it's still mined."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of doing a Bob Hope-like, big-deal show, Williams flitted
through Bagram, doing little performances, signing dozens and dozens
of autographs, and posing for photos.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Bob Hope retired, but so is the whole concept of the
traveling USO show. There are no more variety shows like the kind Rob
and Laura Petrie performed in during their Army days on "The Dick Van
Dyke Show."</TE>
<TE>   These days, the military tends to get individual performers or
celebrities, said Lt. Tina Kroske, a base spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Among the first visitors to Bagram were the Dallas Cowboy
cheerleaders. Joan Jett recently performed. Another visitor was New
York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who ate dinner with troops from his
city. Next at Bagram, they're hoping for a country-western singer,
and more stars like Williams.</TE>
<TE>   An Afghanistan assignment is a heavy-duty chore, soldiers say,
with not much in the way of distractions other than waiting for a hot
shower to wash away the dirt, which covers the terrain in an
Aspen-perfect three-inch blanket of powder. Then the wind blows it
around.</TE>
<TE>   New arrivals sometimes think they are getting a bad cold, but that
turns out to be the dust. They call it the Bagram crud.</TE>
<TE>   The sprawling base, in a desert valley outside Kabul at the end of
a two-lane highway still lined with live land mines, is a heavily
fortified little piece of America.</TE>

<HD>Discovery Channel guards its turf</HD>
<DH>The cable enterprise is moving to block shows it buys from
appearing on its rival, National Geographic Channel, leaving
producers caught in the middle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Discovery Channel normally focuses on science and nature
programming, but lately the cable empire appears to be borrowing a
page from ESPN, teaching producers and a fledgling competitor a few
things about playing hardball.</LD>
<LD>   Under a recently implemented policy, the Bethesda, Md., company is
moving to effectively block productions it buys from appearing on the
National Geographic Channel, a similarly themed cable enterprise
launched last year.</LD>
<LD>   Industry sources say Discovery's action is an attempt to protect
its turf against a new competitor with a strong brand name, as
established cable channels face the challenge of having their
audience siphoned away by the similarly themed competitors sprouting
up to fill expanded capacity on satellite and digital cable services.</LD>
<TE>   Caught in the middle, meanwhile, are documentary producers, who
object to Discovery's approach but say they dare not risk alienating
a company that operates nearly a dozen channels -- among them TLC and
Animal Planet -- because it is such a major buyer of programs in
their genre.</TE>
<TE>   Discovery, which licenses programs from producers for up to seven
years, has revised contracts to say that such productions cannot be
sold to National Geographic, in any of the international territories
where it operates, for at least five years once a deal with Discovery
is reached.</TE>
<TE>   The provision significantly expands Discovery's control over
suppliers.</TE>
<TE>   In effect, the mandate seeks to deprive National Geographic of
access anywhere in the world to programs Discovery acquires, while
cutting off producers from a logical venue to sell their shows.</TE>
<TE>   "They're saying, 'Take it or leave it,' " said one producer, who
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   A Discovery spokesman said the provision is nothing more than "a
prudent business decision. We do not believe that our financing of
program development should underwrite those of our competitors."</TE>
<TE>   Discovery officials also said that National Geographic has its own
safeguards in place, among them denying producers the right to use
footage from National Geographic's library in documentaries assembled
for Discovery. They stressed, however, that the channel's stance was
not retaliatory but stemmed from legitimate competitive concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Discovery has a significant head start on National Geographic,
which reaches 36 million homes, less than half the number that
receive Discovery's flagship channels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the newer channel -- a joint venture between the venerable
magazine and Fox parent News Corp. -- has commitments that will put
it in more than 55 million homes during the next few years.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Wilk, executive vice president of programming, production
and news for National Geographic Channel, said the network was
"flattered but concerned" to be singled out in this manner.</TE>
<TE>   "This is bad for the production community," he said. "The real
negative impact is to the independent producers out there. We don't
think producers should be taken hostage in the competitive battle
between networks.... It's very unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   John Agoglia, an entertainment industry consultant who for years
oversaw business affairs at NBC, agreed, saying that Discovery's
policy creates a problem for producers because the network's fee
seldom covers all production expenses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual, and it further restricts the supplier from
recouping his costs," Agoglia said. "They have a limited list of
buyers in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Producers said that Discovery has sought to impose onerous terms
upon them in the past, including a proposal this year to remove
on-screen credits from programs. After criticism from various
quarters -- including documentary filmmakers and the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences, which presents the Emmy Awards --
Discovery made the elimination of credits optional.</TE>
<TE>   Agoglia, who earned a reputation as a tough negotiator at NBC,
said Discovery's contractual guidelines reflect how the power
equation in television favors networks in dealings with program
suppliers. He added that compared with Discovery "we were pussycats."</TE>

<LD>"Arrested deterioration," says Linda Barth, senior management analyst
for the L.A. Department of Recreation and Parks, and from her tone,
it is obvious she does not quite approve. She is standing on an old
stone wall, built as part of a WPA project, in Griffith Park. She is
describing what's left of the original Los Angeles Zoo, which can be
seen at the Old Zoo picnic ground, just north of the carousel.</LD>
<LD>   Barth has, in the trunk of her car, a stack of new signs that will
explain the structures that for years Angelenos have picnicked and
played on -- the abandoned cages, the ruined buildings, the faux-rock
habitats cut into the hill like some set from "Land of the Lost."</LD>
<LD>   The habitats are officially bear grottoes, but kids just call them
"the caves." The caves look very natural, except for the doors at the
back. The doors are made of bars, like prison doors, and they are
locked. On the other side of the doors are stairways -- rimed in
small leaves and mulch -- that lead up the hill. The stairs are steep
and tantalizingly spooky; it is impossible not to want to open the
doors, not to shake them in hopes that a lock will give way.</LD>
<TE>   "These are the dungeons," one little boy recently informed
onlookers. "There are ghosts here. Scary ghosts." Three little girls
nearby shrieked with glee. The sun was shining cheerfully down the
stairs and people were eating corn chips a few feet away but he
seemed quite certain of his information.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Barth's brown and white signs will provide information about
the old zoo, which opened in 1912 and closed in 1964. One sign will
point out, for example, that elephants, zebras and goats once
socialized on the central lawn, now used for festivals and family
reunions, for plays and the L.A. Philharmonic's summer Concert in the
Glen series. During these events, it is easy to leave the present. On
a recent Sunday, a crowd huddled in the shade beneath white awnings,
swatting at yellow jackets while others spread their blankets in the
sun all the way up the hill. As the players tuned their instruments
on an emerald lawn, bees rose and fell like dust motes and children
played where bears once lived. One half expected to see Lewis
Carroll, all velveteen and linen, leaning against a tree.</TE>
<TE>   Barth and other park officials believe it is important for people
to know the history of the area, even if it is a bit sketchy. There
are no records, for example, describing the occupants of a half-dozen
square cages nearest the grottoes. Ivy drips through the black bars,
falls like a Pre-Raphaelite's hair around the stone lairs within. The
ground is sprung with weeds, crisscrossed with shadow and marked with
the thumbprints of fallen eucalyptus leaves. Anything or anyone could
have lived here--foxes, perhaps, or captive princes; hobbits would
not be completely out of place.</TE>
<TE>   Officials surmise that a small house above the grottoes was the
veterinary, because there are cages attached to the building.
Door-less and windowless, it has seen the business end of many a
spray-paint can. This is still the city and the city is rarely tame
-- one can only imagine the years of furtive fornication, smoking and
snorting beneath this roof. A little farther up the road, against a
leaf-covered hillside, there is another cage, a larger cage, silver
and shocking amid the gentle eucalyptus. Inside the cage is the
detritus of the city--beer bottles and disposable lighters, condoms
and Styrofoam cups. The door to the cage is open--Barth figures that
as long as no one can get locked in or hurt, it might be "beneficial"
for a person to see what the world looks like from inside the cage.</TE>
<TE>   It was the graffiti, and the bad behavior, that drew Barth's
attention in the first place. The rangers had complained, so rather
than raze or abandon the old zoo completely, Barth and her colleagues
decided to reclaim it.</TE>
<TE>   They hope the new signs will be the first step toward preservation
and restoration of the area; they would like to keep the graffiti and
the bad behavior under control.</TE>
<TE>   They would like to develop a program using this site with its
antiquated cages as an instructive example of how animal captivity
has improved. All of which seems very sensible and worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   But there is something else here, something wild and unsettling,
perhaps more valuable than an educational program. Here in the middle
of a city, the forest steadily consumes the structures of man. Here
is proof that time is slow, but steady and purposeful.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles so often seems new and impatient. We constantly tear
things down, but we have few ruins, few moldering stone walls or
ancient wells, no half-surfaced castles or cathedrals, no
inexplicable henge looming against the sky. People need to see ruins
rising from the verge; they are romantic and chilling, they remind us
that queens have trod where we step, or common folk of another time.
They remind us that this age too shall pass, that the earth has its
own plans after all.</TE>
<TE>   The path passes the cages; as it moves toward the heart of the
park, the party-hat skyline of Glendale becomes visible. Above, crows
call to each other, a sound like an iron door opening. And from the
corner of your eye, you can see the zoo in the forest, the ghost zoo,
hear the monkeys and the lions, the thud of the zebra hooves.</TE>

<DH>Photographer Sebastiao Salgado sees his work as documents,
not art.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Brazilian gold mine as a hellishly beautiful pit, strung with
rickety ladders and crawling with human worker bees. An Indian train
station so unbearably crowded that a stream of people pressed between
two railway cars gushes into a flood. A ravishingly gorgeous
Ecuadorean landscape, cut by a long, sad line of women trudging to
market.</LD>
<LD>   Sebastiao Salgado's moody black-and-white pictures of the world's
poor and oppressed make a visual epic of human drama and travail.</LD>
<LD>   To his admirers, Salgado is much more than a documentary
photographer. He is an extraordinary artist who "invokes a poetic
sense of struggles so profound that ... the forces of light and
darkness, of life and death, are summoned," in the words of one
scholar.</LD>
<TE>   His work has found a huge audience at art museums and galleries as
well as in print, but the Paris-based photographer has no artistic
pretensions. He arrives at the Peter Fetterman Gallery in Santa
Monica -- where a 25-year survey of his work is on view -- neatly
dressed in jeans, a dark blue shirt and black sweater vest, and gets
down to business. Soft-spoken but intensely engaged in his work, he
plops down on a comfortable couch, fixes his pale blue eyes on his
interviewer and talks.</TE>
<TE>   "I made these as documents," he says of the works on display. "I
didn't do them as art." Like objects that were made to serve a
utilitarian or ceremonial purpose but are now perceived as art,
documentary photographs may become art over time, he says. But they
don't start out that way.</TE>
<TE>   "I shoot hundreds of pictures to tell a story," he says. "They go
to magazines, humanitarian organizations, wherever they are wanted.
If people want to buy them and put them in their homes, why not? The
point is to look at them and see what they tell."</TE>
<TE>   Born in 1944 on a farm in Brazil, Salgado was trained as an
economist and worked for the Brazilian Ministry of Finance and in the
investment department of the London-based International Coffee
Organization. In the early '70s, he began experimenting with a camera
that his wife, architect Lelia Wanick Salgado, had purchased for her
work. Intrigued, he took the camera on a business trip to Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went back to London, the pictures gave me 10 times more
pleasure than the economic reports," he says. "I discovered another
way to relate to people."</TE>
<TE>   By 1973 Salgado had taken up a new profession, one grounded in
what had gone before. Growing up in a relatively poor country and
studying economics laid the foundation for his passion: photographing
social movements.</TE>
<TE>   His life experiences are at the core of his imagery, he says. And
his grasp of global economics has prepared him to interpret
inequities in human terms: "This has given me a very nice tool of
analysis, to understand what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   But the pictures themselves are always a surprise. "This is a
craft, not an industry," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three decades, Salgado has photographed independence
movements in Angola and Rhodesia, famine in the Sahel region of
Africa, Kuwait's burning oil fields, Vietnamese boat people and the
troubles of war-torn Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   He also has pursued global themes that have led to big picture
books. "Workers: An Archaeology of the Industrial Age," published in
1993, is the result of an eight-year effort to portray the last gasp
of manual labor. "Migrations: Humanity in Transition," published in
2000, is a panorama of displaced people, made over seven years in 40
countries. A new book, to be released next year with a series of
exhibitions, will document efforts to eradicate polio.</TE>
<TE>   To do these projects, Salgado says, "you don't just go somewhere
for two hours, get a picture and come back. You spend time, live with
the people and understand their reality, which has its own speed. If
you come with your own speed and push and push and push, you don't
see what's in front of you."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he has a daunting schedule, and it involves more than
photography. Three years ago he and his wife founded the nonprofit
Instituto Terra to replant the Atlantic rain forest in their native
Brazil. Since then, with the help of thousands of local people and
worldwide contributions, 300,000 trees have been planted on a former
wasteland.</TE>
<TE>   "The human degradation I photograph is linked to environmental
degradation," Salgado says. "My job is to speak about it and raise
money." The night before the opening of his show, he did exactly that
at a Westside fund-raiser. Two days later, he took off to spread the
word in San Francisco.</TE>

<HD>Martell's play isn't as fearless as its explorers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Lewis &amp; Clark bicentennial scant months away, it is timely
of the Colony Theatre to present Leon Martell's "Bea[u]tiful in the
Extreme" as the third offering of its inaugural Equity season. This
new play about the Corps of Discovery's 1804-05 Northwest Passage
possesses considerable integrity in both execution and intent.</LD>
<LD>   Refracted through the tortured mind of Meriwether Lewis (the
excellent Donald Sage Mackay) in his final days, the tale spins back
and forth across time, taking an ephemeral approach to literal
occurrences.</LD>
<LD>   The prologue finds Lewis waxing poetic on the apron of Stephanie
Kerley Schwartz's wood-slatted setting, the ensemble staring in
silent witness above him. With sudden shifts in David Flad's lighting
and Michael Hooker's sound, the center platform becomes a ship, with
Lewis evincing latter-day desperation. This begins a kaleidoscopic
journey that moves from triumph to tragedy in an inexorable spiral.</LD>
<TE>   Director David Rose deploys choral and ritual techniques to
rewarding effect. Particularly striking are the realizations of the
water routes and the perilous Continental Divide.</TE>
<TE>   The design factions are invaluable, including Richard A. Hardin's
well-chosen properties and A. Jeffrey Schoenberg's splendid costumes.
They clothe a finely tuned ensemble in multiple roles, repeatedly
harvesting humor and emotional point.</TE>
<TE>   Mackay's ravaged youthful quality is perfect for Lewis. As William
Clark, Tony Maggio lacks the famous red hair, but he is as ever an
actor of rare presence and articulation.</TE>
<TE>   DeLanna Studi's remarkable Sacagawea has an acute inner response
that reaches a heart-rending peak in the Act 2 recollection of her
childhood abduction. Patrick Huey's intense dignity as Clark's slave
York pulls the proceedings into another level of significance
altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Other standouts are Tom Dugan's Gen. Clark, Kenneth Martines'
Black Buffalo, Kevin Symons' Mrs. Lewis, Andrew David James' Shannon,
Blaise Messinger's Charbonneau and Jonathan Palmer's Drouillard.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the group commitment and design aplomb rather outstrip
Martell's script. The epistolary selections shrewdly mold the
narrative fabric, but it still may take uninformed audiences half of
Act 1 to sort out what is happening.</TE>
<TE>   More critically, Martell betrays a hesitancy to ascribe imagined

<TE>   Ultimately, "Bea[u]tiful in the Extreme" recalls John Belluso's

<HD>Alvarez Bravo's camera made time stand still</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur Ollman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Hay tiempo." These words were casually hand-printed in his darkroom,
on a small sign next to his enlarger. "There is time." For Manuel
Alvarez Bravo, there was always time. What other medium is more
essential?</LD>
<LD>   There was a feeling of abundant time around Don Manuel. I always
felt it in his presence. Perhaps it was his calm and deliberate pace,
his gentle demeanor. Perhaps it was that I didn't get to know him
until the late 1980s, when he was in his late 80s. He seemed to take
time to consider whatever it was that he wanted to focus on.</LD>
<LD>   For many people around the world, he embodied Latin American
photography. Even among young photographers, who continuously seek to
break with the traditions of their medium, Alvarez Bravo was a
beloved great-grandfather. In my 36 years in the photographic arts, I
never heard a single personal criticism of him.</LD>
<TE>   In 1966, I spent a month hitchhiking and photographing in Mexico.
In Oaxaca, I found a poster advertising an exhibition of the
photographs of Manuel Alvarez Bravo at the Escuela de Bellas Artes.
The image on the poster was a portrait of a young woman whose face
was striped by the shadows of a palm frond. I stole the poster from
the wall, and I probably still have it. I found the exhibition and
was thoroughly and permanently changed by the photographs. I tried
with every exposure that month to replicate his imagery. The poetic
evocations, the rich and mysterious references to pre-Columbian
symbols and recognition of the transformative power of Mexico's
intense light, all were beyond my understanding of the medium. I was
21, and Alvarez Bravo was a giant.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four years later, as a curator and the director of the
Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego, I asked Don Manuel if I
could work with him to create a career retrospective to tour the
United States. After several days of conversations, to my great good
fortune, he agreed. This bilingual show, "Revelaciones: The Art of
Manuel Alvarez Bravo," opened in San Diego in 1990 and traveled to 10
American cities. Hundreds of thousands of people saw it.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo never disputed any interpretation of his work.
Curators have labeled him a surrealist, called his work Freudian,
Marxist, patriotic and symbolist. He has never disagreed. When I
inquired, he said, "They might be right." I asked his good friend
Nissan Perez, curator of photography at the Israel Museum in
Jerusalem, to write an essay for the catalog of our exhibition.
Nissan speaks and writes fluently in six languages (including Ladino,
an ancient form of Spanish), and had worked with Manuel years
earlier. His essay is the only one in English to interpret the
pre-Columbian mythological references in much of Alvarez Bravo's
work. I asked Manuel what he thought about the essay. He said it was
excellent, and when I inquired if Nissan had been correct about
Manuel's thinking, he said, "Maybe."</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo was born in Mexico City in 1902. In his childhood
there was a revolution going on outside his door. He arrived at his
affection for the underclass and pride in the ancient history of
Mexico at this time. He worked as a government bureaucrat until the
age of 27, when he was able to work full-time in photography.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '20s, he developed friendships with the great artists
of the time. The muralistas Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and
David Alfaro Siqueiros, Frida Kahlo (whose father Guillermo was one
of his photography teachers), Tina Modotti, Edward Weston, Sergei
Eisenstein, Maria Izquierdo, Dr. Atl, Andre Breton, Henri
Cartier-Bresson, Rufino Tamayo, Octavio Paz: All became his friends,
and the great photographer Lola Alvarez Bravo became his student as
well as his first wife.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez Bravo was a quiet and humble man in a time of noisy
immodesty. The major figures of his time were loud, feisty and
bombastic. Rivera was a huge man who carried a pistol and dominated
every room he entered. Modotti was deported for her political
activities. The murals being made at the time were huge, often the
size of buildings. The colors were brilliant in the dry sun. The
subjects included struggling Maya gods, peasant revolutionaries
wresting their living from a reluctant earth, huge backs bent to the
task. Evil businessmen fought to enchain them all.</TE>
<TE>   In this milieu, a small, shy man, understated nearly to the point
of silence, made small black-and-white photographs of quotidian
observations in the streets of Mexico City: a dog asleep at a gate, a
ladder against a wall, fresh sheets hanging on a line, a woman
brushing her long hair. It is amazing that he was even noticed at
all. Yet his work has endured. Through revelations of timeless yet
unremarkable moments, he identified the doors to the absolute.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1960s, Alvarez Bravo was the only Mexican photographer
recognized outside of Mexico. His influence internally was enormous.
Virtually every major photographer to emerge from Mexico in the last
40 years learned from him. In 1962 he married Colette Alvarez
Urbajtel, who printed most of the images we see today. She has become
a major photographer as well, exhibiting around the world. Pedro
Meyer, Graciela Iturbide, Pablo Ortiz Monasterio and Flor Garduno all
worked with him.</TE>
<TE>   In his last years, his eyesight deteriorated, yet he never stopped
working. He photographed the large trees in the courtyard of his home
in Coyoacan and the shadows they cast on his walls. He could see
those grand shapes and elegantly composed them in a sort of balletic
combat between the forces of light and darkness.</TE>
<TE>   All photographs are about time, its progress and its arrest. Don
Manuel's observations will continue to intrigue and charm us. His
death does nothing to diminish that. These preserved revelations will
slow us down and remind us to pause and look at the texture of our
lives and the time that encases it. Hay tiempo. There is time.</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Ollman is the director of the Museum of Photographic Arts,
San Diego.</TE>

<HD>NEA fights for its life -- and ours</HD>
<DH>In these bloody times, America needs the sustenance that
comes from art in all its forms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Phillips</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is that thing still around? I thought they killed that thing off.
Didn't they?</LD>
<LD>   The thing: The National Endowment for the Arts, our modestly
budgeted federal arts funding agency, in its 37th and currently
leaderless year, despite the periodic political machinations of
"they."</LD>
<LD>   They: "They" are the agency's generally conservative political
critics, who back in the late 1980s held up -- literally, held them
up, on the floor of the Senate -- such NEA grant-funded nastiness as
the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe (gay imagery, explicit) and
Andres Serrano (crucifix, floating in urine). Those were the days for
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas). They could
really sink their teeth into photos like that. With such
sweet-smelling political hay, it was harvest time all season long.</LD>
<TE>   Today, the health, tenor and direction of the NEA aren't exactly
the vox populi's No. 1 water cooler topic. We live in bloody times.
America is caught in a strung-out suspense sequence borrowed from too
many screenplays: Its citizenry awaits the next sniper attack, the
next tarot card (yes, we all have seen too many serial-killer
movies), the belligerent threat of American attack on a country that
hasn't provoked us lately.</TE>
<TE>   Our leaders stay on message, and the message has nothing to do
with petty domestic concerns such as the economy or the quality of
American life and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Yet last week, the NEA -- which has been rudderless since the
George W. Bush-appointed Michael P. Hammond died in January, one week
into his chairmanship -- was back in the news a bit as it underwent a
reorganization. But that is all it takes to get the nation's
cash-strapped arts industry good and tense.</TE>
<TE>   Under acting chairman Eileen B. Mason, the NEA has rejiggered its
internal administration, ostensibly to better serve the agency's four
primary goals: artistic creativity and preservation; learning in the
arts; public-private partnerships; and a wider geographic influence.
The reason? Mason referred to the agency's "enormous workload" and
pressing "budget realities" in a phone interview last week. (Mason
was acting chairman from Hammond's death until late August 2002, when
she reverted to senior deputy chairman, although she continues to
head the agency.)</TE>
<TE>   The various NEA program directors now report to two coordinators,
formerly in charge of museums and classical music. In the politically
embattled history of the NEA, grants in the areas of classical music
and mainline museum programming, such as your typical Van Gogh or
Wyeth retrospective, have engendered the least cause for political
alarm.</TE>
<TE>   The questions asked by a New York Times story recently were these:
Will areas such as theater and folk arts lose financial ground under
the new arrangement? Is this simply the latest tooth extraction from
a near-toothless agency?</TE>
<TE>   Mason says such fears are "based on nothing. There was never any
intention of favoring any discipline over another. It never even
crossed my mind."</TE>
<TE>   Naming a chairman to head the NEA apparently hasn't crossed the
president's mind, either. Former NEA head Jane Alexander, who saved
the agency from abolishment during her stormy 1993-97 tenure, puts it
this way: "I would think very shortly the president would put forward
somebody in nomination. I hope so."</TE>
<TE>   Privately, arts lobbyists and administrators suggest that the
shortlist of NEA finalists has remained the same for months. They are
rumored to be former Texas Arts Commissioner Tony L. Chauveaux;
Eilene Rosenblum, executive director emeritus of Young Audiences of
Virginia; and poet Dana Gioia, author of "Can Poetry Matter?"</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps one of these three will inherit an agency that has learned
to play it safe, duck controversies, keep a Republican White House
happy.</TE>
<TE>   The current White House team includes, among others, Lynne Cheney,
wife of the vice president. Like her comrade in cultural arms William
Bennett, to whom words such as "multiculturalism" belong in the realm
of "axis of evil," Cheney likes her culture straight, white and dead.
During Cheney's tenure as head of the National Endowment for the
Humanities, sister to the NEA, when she wasn't whining about the
"anti-Western diatribe" of a grant-funded "Frontline" documentary,
she was actively trying to abolish her own agency. And the NEA was no
better in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   We should run some numbers at this point, if only to remind the
average American taxpayer that our arts subsidy is pathetic.</TE>
<TE>   The new Arts Council funding levels in England, earmarked for
2005-06, total $639 million. The current NEA budget, pending Senate
approval: $126 million. America is a rather larger country than
England. Why does it think so much less of itself as a cultural
entity?</TE>
<TE>   The NEA's value has always been, in large part, symbolic, but it
has served as a symbol with clout. NEA grants have leveraged millions
in privately raised matching funds. Such public-private alliances,
says Roche Schulfer, executive director of the Goodman Theatre in
Chicago, helped the Goodman out of its old space and into its new
facility (along with millions more from the city of Chicago, a city
that knows the value of culture).</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the NEA gets its new leader, that leader might remind the
president: We are our culture. It is not separate from our identity.
A renewed commitment on the federal level to funding that culture, in
all its diverse, contradictory, controversial, occasionally glorious
facets, could serve as "the antidote to the isolationism that could
occur," says American Arts Alliance head Jan Denton, "if this country
isn't careful."</TE>
<TE>   Playwright Arthur Miller's early career involved a stint as a
Works Progress Administration-funded writer in the waning Depression
years. Then as now, for practical and philosophical reasons, he
believes in his government's spending seed money for the arts and for
artists.</TE>
<TE>   "When the cannons have stopped firing, and the great victories of
finance are reduced to surmise and are long forgotten," Miller said
recently, accepting an award, "it is the art of the people that will
confront future generations.</TE>
<TE>   "The arts can do more to sustain the peace than all the wars, the
armaments and the threats and the warnings of the politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Who knows? Maybe the new NEA chairman can take that argument up
the ladder.</TE>

<LD>British author J.K. Rowling will not write an eighth episode of the
popular "Harry Potter" series, her agent said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The British media had been speculating that an extra book may have
been added to the series because Warner Bros., which is making movies
out of the books, had registered more titles.</LD>
<LD>   "The plan is to have only seven books in the series," said Neil

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Providence," the NBC family drama starring Melina Kanakaredes, will
conclude its run on the network with a two-hour finale Dec. 20.</LD>
<LD>   Heading into the season, NBC had ordered just 13 episodes of the
series, which had been a surprise Friday-night hit since its premiere
in January 1999. The show has drawn mediocre ratings this fall,
however, averaging about 10 million viewers, per Nielsen Media
Research estimates, but it actually delivered its best results in
three outings Friday. No replacement has as yet been named for the
time slot.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, NBC has extended full-season, 22-episode orders to the
network's Sunday-night dramas "American Dreams" and "Boomtown."
Combined with higher ratings for "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent," the
new series have improved NBC's Sunday performance, compared with last
year.</LD>

<LD>Architect Maya Lin, best known for designing the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial in Washington, D.C., will create a series of memorials to
Lewis and Clark at four locations in Washington state. She was
approached by the Vancouver, Wash., based-Confluence Project, which
hopes to unveil the sites in 2005 to mark the bicentennial of the
duo's arrival on the West Coast. The cost of the effort is estimated
at $15 million.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next few years, communities from St. Louis to along
Washington state's Snake River will be marking the journey by
explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to find the Northwest
Passage, which was supposed to link the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</LD>
<LD>   The Confluence Project, a nonprofit formed for the effort, came
about after several parties, including a small town on the Washington
coast and a tribal leader in Oregon, thought independently of Lin to
create pieces that could look at the journey from a variety of
perspectives. After connecting with each other, they approached the
architect last year.</LD>
<TE>   Although Lin won't speak publicly about her plan until next year,
project director Jane Jacobsen says Lin will keep in mind the basalt,
pines and water of the Pacific Northwest. "The entire [Columbia]
River is her site," says Jacobsen.</TE>
<TE>   About $3 million has been raised already, mostly from private
funds.</TE>

<HD>New Yorker names fiction editor</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A little-known 32-year-old UC Berkeley graduate has been named
fiction editor of the New Yorker, succeeding Bill Buford, a familiar
presence on the literary scene. David Remnick, the magazine's editor,
has announced that deputy fiction editor Deborah Treisman will begin
her new post in January.</LD>
<LD>   "I think that Bill and I and the other members of the fiction
department -- particularly Cressiday Leyshon, who'll be the new
deputy fiction editor -- have had a fantastic run together, working
to find the best fiction out there, and I can only hope to build on
what's already been done," Treisman said in an e-mail Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Bill set the bar very high, and I hope to continue to champion
the writers he brought in, and to continue to discover new ones,
locally, nationally and internationally."</LD>
<TE>   Buford, 48, will become a European correspondent and write
nonfiction books. Remnick has called Buford "one of the great fiction
editors that the New Yorker has ever had." Traditionally, the
position has been one of the most influential in the literary world.
Under Buford's watch, up-and-comers such as Dave Eggers and Zadie
Smith were published along with such veterans as Stephen King and
Alice Munro.</TE>
<TE>   Treisman, a native of England, is a former managing editor of the
literary journal Grand Street. During her tenure there, the journal
published works by younger, edgy writers such as David Foster Wallace
and William T. Vollmann.</TE>

<HD>Quite a feet accompli</HD>
<DH>Designer George Esquivel will realize a dream when his
collection of custom men's shoes debuts Nov. 7 at Fred Segal Feet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Quintanilla</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Driving through Anaheim, men's shoe designer George Esquivel points
to several motels he and his family called home during his middle
school years.</LD>
<LD>   "Most of the time we didn't know where the next meal or the rent
money would come from," he says, pulling into a parking lot. From the
driver's seat he stares at the motel with a tropical sounding name.
But the place was anything but paradise. "Drugs and mostly scary
people lived there then -- and probably still do today," says
Esquivel, 32, who grew up with his mother and four younger siblings.
"When you live the way we did -- scraping to get by and not knowing
how -- you move a lot. That's how you live when you have no control
over the circumstances." Esquivel is grateful to his mother, Luz
Maria, "and always God," he says, for helping the family break away
from that environment.</LD>
<LD>   He figures that being in those cramped motel rooms in front of a
squiggly television set may have led to his designing career. When he
wasn't mowing lawns, raking leaves or running errands to earn money
for necessities, he'd watch "I Love Lucy." And though Lucy was the
star, it was Ricky Ricardo who captured his attention because he had
such style. And his shoes were sweet.</LD>
<TE>   As a kid, Esquivel would take bright markers to his thrift-store
shoes or patch them up so they'd look stylish, not like
hand-me-downs. Now, more than two decades later, he'll debut his shoe
collection of eight styles in various eye-popping colors -- starting
at $480 a pair -- on Nov. 7 with a fete at Fred Segal Feet on Melrose
Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, his custom designs have been garnering
attention, seen on such famous feet as those of Drew Carey, Kevin
Costner, Seth Green, Richard Tyler and rockers Robin Finck of Guns N'
Roses and Lit guitarist Jeremy Popoff.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Esquivel was invited by the Petersen Automotive
Museum to create shoes influenced by the exotic custom cars on
display. After studying hoods, steering wheels and taillights,
Esquivel created several pairs, including a stunning square-toed
buckled alligator creation inspired by the Buggatti. The pair, among
others, is featured inside a case in the museum's gift store. Price
tag for the Buggatti-inspired shoes: $3,500. Others start at $700.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that I'm not going to sell 500 pairs of these at the
Petersen. That's not the goal. But having a shop on Rodeo Drive
called Esquivel has always been a dream of mine," he says.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Esquivel is content with the nearly 400 pairs for Fred
Segal Feet he and shoemaker Oscar Navarro of Capri Shoes in Fullerton
will create by hand through the holidays. With a $5,000 investment on
the line, Esquivel is confident his timing is right.</TE>
<TE>   He's made shoes with toe boxes cut to resemble drag racing flames,
leather that is punched and layered over yet more leather, woven and
patch-worked. Laced up, buckled and slipped on, from two-toned saddle
shoes to Chelsea boots, from red pony hair and blue suede to
alligator hide, just about the only thing Esquivel won't do is
conservative.</TE>
<TE>   "When George came to me I couldn't resist working with him," says
Navarro, who has been a shoemaker for more than 20 years and
specializes in dancing shoes as well as footwear for entertainers and
clowns. "I've been doing clown shoes for a while, so this is a change
and a challenge I love."</TE>
<TE>   Stanley Silver, who has been in the shoe business for 32 years and
is known, along with his wife, Patricia, for discovering and
promoting new talent at their Fred Segal Feet shop, agrees. But
mostly, Silver and others who know Esquivel admire the designer for
not hiding his past.</TE>
<TE>   "He grew up tough, not having the privileges that a lot of us
enjoy. He's warm, enthusiastic and full of life. All of that is
infectious when you're around him. And he's a rising star. He's going
to capture a niche in dressy men's shoes because his styles are
sophisticated and whimsical," says Silver, who after meeting Esquivel
and seeing the shoes, signed a deal to get them in the shop. "Believe
me, George doesn't put out boring shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Compared with European competitors that can take six months and
longer to turn around a pair of shoes, Silver is pleased with
Esquivel's faster production: four to six weeks from sketch to
finish.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Campuzano, trend forecaster and editor and publisher of
Fashionfactsfolio, a New York-based newsletter for the footwear and
accessories industry, says an operation such as Esquivel's is rare.
"It's really unheard of these days because, basically, the finest
shoemaking comes out of Italy, the center of the leather and shoe
factories of the world." Campuzano frequently attends shoe fairs
across Italy and one in Paris for lesser known designers and smaller
operations.</TE>
<TE>   "Shoemaking is a craft but when you can find a craftsman, it can
be done. But for an American collection to be made in Southern
California is very unique. And a very expensive proposition. I've
seen many shoe collections get started and you've got to either have
very deep pockets or a fabulous collection," she says. Esquivel, she
adds, "has got guts."</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel began designing shoes about eight years ago after he had
a pair made for himself by a boot maker while on a trip to Mexico. "I
sketched a very pointed, black and white spectator shoe with a higher
heel. It was very '60s looking. After that, I was hooked."</TE>
<TE>   Soon, through word of mouth, people started seeking him out. "As I
learned more about the shoes and the more I got involved, the more I
loved it. I went from one cobbler to another and basically improved
what I was doing," he says, giving credit to such master cobblers as
Emigdio Canales, who built boots for daredevil Evel Knievel in the
1960s. He soon learned that it takes more than 100 manufacturing
steps to create a killer pair of shoes.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not stopping people like Arich Berghammer, general
manager for the House of Blues who will get married Saturday in
patent leather creations by Esquivel, a gift from the designer, who
has become a good friend.</TE>
<TE>   Esquivel has come to Berghammer for a final adjustment before the
wedding. The two met in the nightclub's elevator a few years back. "I
looked down at his shoes and admired them," Berghammer recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I have 17 pairs," says the West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce
president. Lowell Northrop, a short film and music video maker who
lives in Los Feliz, met Esquivel through the music scene. "I'm a
T-shirt and jeans wearer so when it comes to shoes I realized that I
wanted something a little different," he says during a fitting with
Esquivel. Northrop points to his saddle shoes in blue ostrich and
brown leather. "I wear these a lot," he says. He's eager to see
Esquivel's sketch of a shoe they have dubbed the Sharp. Northrop has
asked the designer to give the shoe more of a Western flair, which
Esquivel has accomplished in the sketch with curving yokes similar to
those on cowboy shirts.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just what I wanted," Northrop says and before the two part
after talking for more than an hour about music and film and family,
Northrop inquires about another shoe he'd like, reaching for a ring
loaded with dozens of leather swatches in as many colors. "Done,"
Esquivel says.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Esquivel says he's thankful for the way things are going.
He and his wife, his high school sweetheart, Shelley, have three
young children who are looked after by his mom during the day.</TE>
<TE>   "You know when I was growing up I knew that we could never afford
nice stuff. I didn't know the difference between a good pair of shoes
and a bad pair. Now I know. But, still, in the end they're just
shoes. It's not rocket science," he says. "There are more important
things in life. My babies are more important. My wife. My mother. My
brothers and sister. A life that, finally, we can all embrace."</TE>

<HD>Regarding Henry and His Deeds</HD>
<DH>A documentary takes a hard look at the extent of
Kissinger's role in U.S. involvement abroad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Ramsey</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Alex Gibney reflects on his early memories of Henry Kissinger,
who was then the national security advisor to Richard Nixon, his
viewpoint is that of a child of the 1960s. There were the news
reports of American forces invading Cambodia in May 1970, the ensuing
protests on college campuses, the deaths of four students at the
hands of National Guardsmen at Kent State University.</LD>
<LD>   Gibney attended Yale in the mid-'70s; he marched on Washington
with Vietnam veterans. And he watched newscasts of starlets attending
glamorous parties on the arm of the decidedly unglamorous Kissinger.
Power, Kissinger explained for the less enlightened, was the ultimate
aphrodisiac.</LD>
<LD>   Gibney is the co-producer, with Eugene Jarecki, of "The Trials of
Henry Kissinger," a documentary that will open Friday featuring
interviews with former Kissinger colleagues, prominent journalists
and human rights lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   "I grew up hearing that Henry Kissinger was the diplomat of his
age, a model statesman," Jarecki, who was born six months after the
1969 secret bombing of Cambodia, recalled recently over coffee in a
cafe near his office in New York City's TriBeCa. "I was never told
that he was a principal actor in a questionable time in American
foreign policy."</TE>
<TE>   In spring 2001, Gibney and Jarecki independently approached the
BBC about making a documentary based on Christopher Hitchens' "The
Case Against Henry Kissinger," a two-part article that had recently
appeared in Harper's magazine. (Later that year, it became a book,
"The Trial of Henry Kissinger.") The account "took on Kissinger,"
Jarecki said, and questioned his role in the internal affairs of
Indochina, East Timor, Cyprus, Bangladesh and Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, the filmmakers received a green light from the BBC,
which introduced them. Elaboration on the Hitchens account would
include "human motivation, some sense of what made Kissinger tick,"
Gibney said.</TE>
<TE>   The film opens with a montage of a smiling Kissinger in the
limelight, meeting with world leaders, attending a dinner with
Princess Diana, all set to the tune of John Coltrane and Johnny
Hartman's "Lush Life": "I used to visit all the very gay places,
those come-what-may places, where one relaxes on the wheel of life,
to get the feel of life."</TE>
<TE>   "Kissinger's a witty guy, he's very smart, very charming," Gibney
said recently, in his Manhattan office overlooking the Hudson River.
"The music suggests that sumptuous, alluring world. It's playful, as
if to say, 'This will not be an airless, windowless diatribe.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Alexander Haig says he has "deep respect" for
Kissinger's "knowledge, his background, his philosophical outlook."
William Safire calls him "a fascinating mixture of power and
strategy." Television reporter Barbara Howar comments that he "used
his flamboyant personal life to cover up his professional life," and
adds, "He could go to secret meetings" at which "everybody is
concentrating on Kissinger the swinger."</TE>
<TE>   William Shawcross, author of "Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the
Destruction of Cambodia," calls him "an extraordinarily brilliant
man, but he did have this fatal flaw of preferring to act without
public scrutiny." Seymour Hersh, author of "The Price of Power:
Kissinger in the Nixon White House," says, "The dark side of Henry
Kissinger is very, very dark."</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger was born in Germany and was 10 when the Nazis came to
power. "I think you can come out of the Holocaust experience with
many different outlooks," says Walter Isaacson ("Kissinger: A
Biography"). Kissinger "believed that in the end what really mattered
was power."</TE>
<TE>   In the film, Hitchens minces no words: "I think he is a war
criminal," and adds that he is also "a frightened man." In 1998, Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator, was arrested in London and
charged with human rights violations at the request of Spanish
authorities. The London magistrate was writing, notes defense lawyer
Michael Tigar, "one law for one world." Hitchens surmises that "when
the news of that hit, Kissinger instantly thought, Could I be next?"</TE>
<TE>   For the film, Gibney and Jarecki chose three instances of
Kissinger's part in the Nixon and Ford administrations' involvement
in the internal affairs of other countries: the United States' secret
bombing of Cambodia; Indonesia's invasion of East Timor in 1975 using
American weapons; and an alleged role in the 1970 death of Rene
Schneider, a Chilean military commander some in Nixon's
administration viewed as the obstacle to a military coup that would
have prevented the leftist Salvador Allende from assuming Chile's
presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger, who declined to be interviewed for the film, has called
the Hitchens book "contemptible" and did not return phone calls
seeking comment for this article. A year spent figuratively living
with Kissinger was, said Gibney, "interesting," but he found what he
calls Kissinger's "naked ambition a little terrifying."</TE>
<TE>   For Jarecki there was a personal element: "My father left Germany
a year after Kissinger did." His father, Henry, is a
psychiatrist-turned-businessman. "They look alike," said the
director. "Both are thick-lensed, intellectual academics. Both
entered fields in which their foreignness served them well. They look
as if they're in their professions for the sake of the subject, not
as if they're casing the joint.</TE>
<TE>   "But while my father took from his experiences in Nazi Germany the
idea that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely,
Kissinger found it necessary to find and then re-seek power."</TE>
<TE>   In that quest for power, "he keeps changing the color of his
skin," Gibney said. "He starts out an advisor to a liberal
Republican, Nelson Rockefeller, and suddenly he's an extremely
hawkish member of the Nixon White House. But to members of the
liberal press and the Georgetown establishment, he takes on the
coloration of the moderate, reasonable man who's doing his best to
hold the madman, Nixon, in check. He's painting himself as the thin
blue line between the American people and Armageddon. Today, he's
like the Dr. Ruth of American foreign policy, this cuddly guy who
tells you how the world really works."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps surprisingly, both filmmakers have a bit of sympathy for
Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   Gibney said he believes that Kissinger's "capacity for
self-deception is enormous, he can convince himself that the end
justifies the means. But I think there's a battle going on inside his
soul, that maybe he didn't live his life as justly as he might have,
that his life might have been too much about power and too little
about morality and American democracy."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Kissinger has wrestled enormously with the decisions he's
made," Jarecki added. "That's why he is passionate about explaining
the rightness of what he did. But I think deep down he knows that the
human costs were enormous." Jarecki paused for a moment, then added,
"At least I hope he thinks that."</TE>

<LD>With Hollywood presenters galore, but also a pervasive sense of
family, the eighth annual American Choreography Awards celebrated
dance in film and television during a 3 1/2-hour program Sunday at
the Orpheum Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Despite its name, the event honored only dance-for-camera and
didn't limit eligibility to Americans. Chinese martial arts star
Jackie Chan won the Innovator Award, for instance, and the prize in
the feature film category went to Saroj Khan, Raju Khan, Ganesh
Hegde, Vaibhavi Merchant and Terence Lewis for the splashy group
dances in the Indian film "Lagaan."</LD>
<LD>   The award for achievement in television (episodic or sitcom) went
to Marguerite Derricks for the episode of "That '70s Show" titled
"That '70s Musical." A tie in the TV variety or special category
recognized Kenny Ortega, Sarah Kawahara and Doug Jack for the opening
ceremony of the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the team of Daniel Ezralow,
David Parsons and Moses Pendleton for their gymnastics as dance
project "Aeros."</LD>
<TE>   Vincent Paterson won an award for his drill-team Rubbermaid TV
commercial, "Soldier," and the award for music video went to the
seven artists (Anwar "Flii" Burton, Rosero McCoy, Todd Sams, Jamal
Sims, Devyne Stephens, Earl "Punch" Wright, Russell "Goofy" Wright)
who created Usher's "You Don't Have to Call" showcase.</TE>
<TE>   Eloquent speeches by friends and colleagues gave the event's
special awards a memorable outpouring of feeling. Ailing L.A.
dancer-choreographer-teacher Russell Clark received the Governor's
Award, veteran tap teacher and Broadway choreographer Henry LeTang
the Educator Award, and film dancer Marge Champion the Career
Achievement Award for herself and her late husband and partner Gower.
In addition, the late Hollywood choreographer Bob Talmage received a
memorial tribute. In two new categories, Ashley Roland, Jamey Hampton
and Mitchell Rose won the best short film award for their whimsical
"Modern Daydreams" and John Medlen the fight choreography award for
an episode of the series "Alias" titled "Truth Be Told."</TE>
<TE>   Live dance segments proved variable in execution and originality,
with the most indelible piece coming from the world of concert dance,
a haven for American choreography ignored by the American
Choreography Awards. Dancing with almost eerie perfection, Todd
Burnsed and Nicole Loizides of the Momix company performed
Pendleton's duet on skis, "Millennium Skiva," looking like liquid
mercury in their silver bodysuits. However, local dancer and teacher
Terry Beeman's more conventional "Velocity" finale scored a real
coup: getting genuine emotion into the dancers bodies in what
initially seemed just another hard-sell pop showpiece.</TE>
<TE>   Excellent compilations of dance clips also punctuated the evening,
with Will Mead and Alan Johnson's editing of the Champions'
performances and Kate Johnson's Chan collage looking especially deft.
These clips and all the awards submissions go into the archives of
the Academy of Dance on Film in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Awards presenters included Gregory Hines, Raquel Welch, Fayard
Nicholas, Nanette Fabray, Bruce Vilanch, Debi Mazar and Kathy Najimy.</TE>

<LD>"It's your idea, so you do the talking," Rachel told Sabina when they

<LD>   Mrs. Evans was at her desk. "Paul! Matt! Settle down!" The two

<TE>   "Don't be a scaredy cat. Go!" Rachel gave her friend a push.</TE>

minute? We'd like to ask you something."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, what is it?" Mrs. Evans said.</TE>

have that we've outgrown. We wondered if we could do something with

<TE>   Rachel broke in. "Like have a book drive at school? Like get
everyone to bring in their old books and like give them to kids who
don't have any books?"</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's a wonderful idea!" Mrs. Evans said. "But Rachel,
do you think you could leave all those 'likes' out of your
sentences?"</TE>
<TE>   Rachel giggled.</TE>
<TE>   "Class!" Mrs. Evans said. "Listen up!" When the class quieted down
she said, "Sabina and Rachel have come up with an interesting project
for the class. They want to know what you think. Sabina, you explain
it, dear."</TE>
<TE>   Sabina felt her face grow hot, but she described what she and
Rachel wanted to do. "With a publisher donating a book for each book
we bring in, that's two books. And they'll go to nearby schools that
need it." In a tiny voice she asked, "Do you think it's a good idea?"</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great idea!"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes! Yes! Let's do it!" voices called out.</TE>
<TE>   Mrs. Evans smiled. "Looks like you girls have gotten your answer.

<HD>Aiming for 'intelligent talk,' new talk show misses the
mark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Sandell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Walsh joined the syndicated daytime talk-show fray a month and a
half ago, vowing to bring "intelligent talk" to the period when TV
advertisers think only stay-at-home moms, accident victims and those
desiring a career in the medical transcription field are watching.</LD>
<LD>   And though "The John Walsh Show" (KNBC, weekdays at 10 a.m.) has
tackled the Sept. 11 anniversary and the Washington-area sniper
attacks, it has proven to be much like the nighttime program he
hosts, Fox's "America's Most Wanted": a combination of public service
and sensationalism.</LD>
<LD>   A typical installment begins with a guest interview and videotaped
segment involving some troubling aspect of domestic life, child
safety or personal responsibility -- "Is Your Teen Depressed? We Can
Help" and "I Want to Divorce My Child" were topics last week. Then
another guest with the same predicament is introduced, and so on,
until three or four have presented their tales of woe or uplift.</LD>
<TE>   Walsh, who has traded in his "Most Wanted" leather jacket for a
sport coat and open-collar shirt, plays the "Father Knows Best"
arbiter of morality, praising "heroes" by saying how proud he is of
them and invariably thanking them "for having the guts to come on
this show." He tells the less virtuous to straighten up and fly
right.</TE>
<TE>   Surely this is not pure grandstanding, given Walsh's background as
a crusader against crime after his 6-year-old son, Adam, was abducted
and slain in 1981. But for all of its host's sincerity, "The John
Walsh Show" cannot escape the tawdriness that is a hallmark of
daytime TV, often devolving into a bland freak show or pity party, a
chance to thank your lucky stars that your life isn't as messed up as
the ones here.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh also employs the oldest trick in the TV book, imploring
viewers to stay tuned for "good information that you must know,"
which, of course, comes at the hour's end and isn't necessarily worth
the wait.</TE>
<TE>   So much for "intelligent talk."</TE>

<KH>CANDIDATES' WIVES: SHARON DAVIS</KH>
<HD>Representing the flip side</HD>
<DH>Described as likable and warm, some say the governor's wife
is everything he's not.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Warren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sacramento</LD>
<LD>   Midway through her debut year as California's first lady, Sharon
Davis received an unexpected invitation: Please, asked officials at
Cal State Chico, deliver our commencement address.</LD>
<LD>   She quickly agreed. But as luck would have it, graduation day was
a 109-degree sizzler. So Davis, gazing out at the crowd of wilting
seniors, cut short her speech and struggled to come up with a
memorable send-off.</LD>
<TE>   Her final message to the Chico State class of 2000? "Party on!"</TE>
<TE>   The graduates roared their approval, and Davis figured she had
scored big. Then came the next day's headline: Governor's Wife Tells
Grads to Party On.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Davis likes to tell this story, which says a lot about her.
Unlike her ever-cautious husband, she is voluble, self-deprecating
and not afraid to share a laugh at her own expense. She's also a deft
speaker who can read an audience and will risk an embarrassing moment
if it feels right.</TE>
<TE>   While polls show that most California voters view Democratic Gov.
Gray Davis with something well short of affection, his petite,
red-haired wife seems to delight and comfort his constituents
wherever she goes.</TE>
<TE>   That ability has made her the not-so-secret weapon in the Davis
reelection effort, a surrogate who, some advisors say, tops the
candidate himself in her ability to work a room, disarm skeptics and
distill the governor's accomplishments into a real-world message.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis isn't a political natural," says Garry South, the
governor's chief campaign strategist. "Sharon Davis is."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Barbara O'Connor, director of the Institute for Politics and
Media at Cal State Sacramento: "Four years of exposure to Gray Davis
has not made us like him. Ten minutes of exposure to Sharon Davis
makes you genuinely like her."</TE>
<TE>   While many political spouses campaign grudgingly or want no role
at all, Davis, 48, relishes the job. Her years as a flight attendant,
she says, were perfect preparation: "I learned to smile even when my
feet hurt."</TE>
<TE>   The governor may be raising millions in his campaign for a second
term, but it is his wife who is doing the ground-level work.
Traveling five days a week, she rallies volunteers, mingles with
labor leaders and preaches the Gray Davis gospel -- moderate
policies, incremental change -- to all willing listeners. By late
October, that pace will have accelerated to seven days a week.</TE>
<TE>   Consultants say a likable spouse can boost a candidate's image
immeasurably, projecting his human side and, in the case of an
unpopular politician, providing living proof that he may not be so
bad after all.</TE>
<TE>   "An articulate, energetic wife can stand up and say, 'You know, I
live with this man 24 hours a day, I see how hard he works, what his
commitment is,' " says Larry Thomas, an advisor to former GOP Govs.
Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian. "That presents a tremendous little
window for a curious person to look into."</TE>
<TE>   A sense of awe</TE>
<TE>   Sharon Davis never expected to lead a life even remotely
resembling the one she has now. At her 30-year high school reunion in
August, she told friends she still pinches herself to make sure it's
all real. At other events, she says the smartest thing she ever did
was marry well.</TE>
<TE>   Even after nearly four years as first lady, Davis projects a sense
of awe about her station in life. And she still speaks with a candor
unsettling for the guarded political set.</TE>
<TE>   Born Sharon Lee Ryer, the daughter of a Navy petty officer and a
housewife, she was one of seven children raised in the small town of
Santee near San Diego. The boisterous, church-going household was a
happy place, she says, though her father was stingy with affection
and ordered everyone around. Sharon, a middle child, was plump, wore
glasses, got Cs and, she recalls, "had no real direction in life."</TE>
<TE>   In high school, however, she became what friend Dora Winn calls
"the swan" -- slimming down, dying her hair blond and "turning into
the quintessential California girl." At 15, her parents urged her to
enter the Miss Santee beauty pageant, and she won. The victory, Davis
says, gave her a surge of confidence about what the future might
hold.</TE>
<TE>   Her ticket out of Santee was as a flight attendant for now-defunct
Pacific Southwest Airlines. Competition for jobs with the carrier was
stiff, and Davis recalls being very proud of her achievement until a
kid on the street pointed to her uniform -- miniskirt, red high heels
-- and observed that she must work for Burger King. After that, she
changed clothes at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   It was on a PSA flight that she met her future husband, in a 1979
episode both love to recount. Gray Davis, then chief of staff for
Gov. Jerry Brown, was running late, causing the pilot to hold the jet
on the runway. When he boarded without an apology, flight attendant
Ryer was waiting: "Who do you think you are? You just made 120 people
late."</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly love at first sight.</TE>
<TE>   On subsequent flights, however, the two got to talking. And
eventually, as improbable as it seemed to friends, they began dating.
She was 25, he was 36.</TE>
<TE>   On their first date, he asked her opinion of the Equal Rights
Amendment. "I had no idea what he was talking about," Davis admits.
"I went to work in a miniskirt. Feminism wasn't part of my life."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gulf between them, it was an exciting romance,
highlighted by dinners with Brown and his flame of that time, singer
Linda Ronstadt. The awkward part was telling her parents -- staunch
Republicans -- that she was seeing the top aide to "Governor
Moonbeam," as the iconoclastic Brown was known. The Ryers were
appalled, but eventually accepted their daughter's beau and even
voted for him -- at first by absentee ballot to avoid being seen in a
Democratic booth.</TE>
<TE>   After five years of dating, she grew tired of being what she calls
"the girlfriend of," a position she says "has no credibility in
politics." "Gray was taking a trip to Israel. I told him that when he
got back, we were either engaged or he didn't need to show up at my
place," she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   The ultimatum worked. In February, the couple will celebrate their
20th wedding anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Beloved by her staff</TE>
<TE>   The cliche about opposites attracting sums up the first couple
quite well. She is light, outgoing, beloved by her staff. He is
mercurial, inward, famously difficult to work for.</TE>
<TE>   Although both are health nuts, climbing the Stairmaster with
religious dedication, she deviates from their preferred daily diet of
chicken and steamed broccoli to indulge in an occasional dessert. He
rarely does.</TE>
<TE>   While he's a workaholic, she has a well-developed playful side.
Shortly after the 1998 election that ushered him into office, a Los
Angeles radio station invited listeners to call in and vote on
whether the new governor was a "babe." His wife called in.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a babe when I married him," she declared, "and he's still
a babe today." In an interview, she elaborates: "I think he is
attractive, not in a Ben Affleck kind of way, but he has striking
features."</TE>
<TE>   Asked to analyze her husband, Davis says he is a man of utter
discipline and restraint, a reaction, she says, to an alcoholic
father who ran out on the family with another woman. She recalls a
photo from his years at Stanford University, a group shot of him and
his fraternity brothers. All the other Greeks wore togas; Gray Davis
wore a buttoned-down shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as if he knew he was going to be governor someday," she
marvels. "He doesn't try to be dull, but he accepts who he is and
hasn't tried to remake himself like some politicians."</TE>
<TE>   Aides to the governor give thanks daily for the first lady. One
reason for their affection is her effect on him. A volcanic man, the
governor is visibly soothed by her presence.</TE>
<TE>   "She has an alchemy-like effect on him," South says. "He has a
temper," another official says, "and she can put out the fire. He
doesn't want to behave badly in front of her."</TE>
<TE>   To maximize her influence, the governor's advisors like to seal
the two alone in a room before a major speech, such as his inaugural
address and appearance at the 2000 Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles. During those moments, the governor says, the two often
pray, "and she keeps me grounded."</TE>
<TE>   In the 25 years he's known his wife, Gray Davis remembers only two
days when she got up in a bad mood. But that sunny disposition,
nurtured by her nightly reading of the Bible, masks some personal
pain.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, she lost her mother after a long bout with Alzheimer's
disease. Soon after, she found herself caring for her father,
stricken with inoperable cancer. He died in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   With her parents gone, Davis became unofficial guardian for a
younger brother beset by psychological problems. In between her
duties as first lady, she takes his often frantic phone calls or
makes emergency runs to San Diego, stocking his refrigerator with
food, resolving disagreements, or just providing reassurance.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about him, Davis' striking blue eyes fill with tears: "You
can do the tough love thing, but the other side of me says I'm not
comfortable with that. I can't come home, live this nice life and
just turn away from it, so I help him."</TE>
<TE>   Another brother battles substance abuse, and occasionally becomes
homeless and loses touch with his siblings. "Every family has
struggles," she says. "We're no different."</TE>
<TE>   Tears also surface as Davis talks of the couple's inability to
have children. "I think because of my faith," she says, "I could
accept that if I was meant to have a child, I'd have a child.</TE>
<TE>   "I love kids," she adds, "and Gray would have been a wonderful
parent. It's sad when you think about it...." Her voice trails off
for a moment. Then the wistful look is gone.</TE>
<TE>   "But I look at our life, at how Gray is in a job that is
all-consuming. And I think, can I picture him sitting on the sideline
at soccer practice, signing bills?"</TE>
<TE>   'Snap out of it!'</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis says his wife has made him a better person. "Some
people say I have a long ways to go," he adds in an interview, "but
you should have seen me before I met her."</TE>
<TE>   Six weeks into his governorship, he says he was "thunderstruck" by
all the demands from Democrats wanting action on this or that issue.
He complained to his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "She listened for about 10 seconds," he recalls, "and said, 'Snap
out of it! You've worked all your life to become governor, so enjoy
every moment, even the bad ones.' "</TE>
<TE>   That sort of spousal scolding, however good-natured, would never
happen in public. If Davis is anything, she is unswervingly loyal.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to name an issue on which she has disagreed with her
husband, she could not come up with a single one. Her Republican
predecessor, Gayle Wilson, was not so reticent. She vocally split
with her husband over publicly funded abortions, which he opposed as
a U.S. senator.</TE>
<TE>   And although Davis cites Eleanor Roosevelt and Hillary Rodham
Clinton as the first ladies she most admires, she lacks their
independent, activist streak. Though well-briefed on the issues, she
will not lobby her husband or work behind the scenes, advancing an
agenda. That low-key style has insulated her from the type of
criticism that dogged her heroines.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people seem to want me to whisper in his ear about
something," she says. "But that's not my job. I'm not going to do
that."</TE>
<TE>   She does, however, share in the frustrations that go along with
running the nation's most populous state. She frets when the governor
gets blamed for things that go wrong, but she's more troubled when he
fails to get credit when things go right.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, however, Davis is too busy and too contented to complain.
Aside from her advocacy of schools, reading and the Healthy Families
insurance program for the poor, she serves as a mentor to a
Sacramento seventh-grader, spending time each week helping the child
with her math and other struggles.</TE>
<TE>   In between her official duties, Davis tries to fit in yoga, a
round of golf, a hunt for antiques or an hour rereading works by her
favorite author, Mark Twain. And recently, she wrote a children's
book, "Capitol Kitty," based on a feline that lives outside her
office window. Proceeds from the book, due out this month, will go
toward improving school libraries.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the first lady's life is a blur of campaign stops
as she tries to persuade voters her husband deserves four more years.
On a recent swing through far Northern California, she faced thin
crowds, a grueling schedule and steamy temperatures.</TE>
<TE>   But her smile never dimmed and she showed a nimble mastery of the
issues, from the energy crisis to school test scores, water
allocations for farmers and expansion of the state's health insurance
program for poor families.</TE>
<TE>   After hearing her stump speech in Del Norte County, the chairman
of the county's Board of Supervisors, Chuck Blackburn, is sold:
"She's a high-energy person, and she knows her stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of this journey, Davis is the headliner at a luncheon
in the heavily Republican farm-belt town of Colusa. The event is
supposed to raise money for two Democrats running for legislative
seats, but the turnout is bleak -- 14 people, to be exact. The first
lady's campaign aide looks mortified, and works her cell phone to
find out what's gone wrong. But if Davis cares, she hides it well.
Small crowd? Great! That way she can meet everybody! "Whether it's 12
people or 200, they are there for you and deserve your best," she
says.</TE>
<TE>   Marching into the cavernous room in low-heeled Ferragamos, Davis
shares an embrace here, a sympathetic ear there. Then she gives her
10-minute pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Democrats are moving this state forward!" she concludes,
thrusting a fist skyward as a cardboard campaign sign falls off the
wall.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd applauds warmly, seemingly shocked that the first lady
has bothered to show up in their tiny town, at their tiny event. As
Davis leaves, a bodyguard spots the hem of her St. John's knit skirt
unraveling. Unperturbed, she ducks into the ladies' room for repairs.</TE>

<LD>Encores of two new ABC Tuesday comedies -- "Life With Bonnie" and
"Less than Perfect" -- will run Saturdays on Walt Disney Co.'s ABC
Family cable channel four days after their initial network broadcast.</LD>
<LD>   The Saturday night programming block is Disney's first major foray
into "repurposing" or rerunning ABC shows on its sister cable
channel. Disney paid $5.2 billion last year to buy the cable channel
for additional advertising revenue and to have a secondary outlet for
Disney-owned movies and TV shows. In August, ABC Family ran a
modified version of ABC's dating show, "The Bachelor."</LD>
<LD>   ABC Family had planned to include the back-in-time ABC drama,
"That Was Then," in its Saturday night block, but poor ratings forced
network executives earlier this month to cancel the show. Disney's
Touchstone Television produces "Life With Bonnie," "Less than
Perfect" and "That Was Then."</LD>
<TE>   Disney isn't the only media company trying to extend the life of
its shows before syndication. AOL Time Warner Inc.'s HBO network
reruns the same episode of "The Sopranos" three nights after the
show's first airing on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   And this is the second season that the WB program "Charmed,"
produced by Spelling Television, replays on AOL Time Warner's TNT
cable network. "Charmed" runs on TNT two nights after its initial
Sunday night airing on the WB.</TE>
<TE>   The WB also is rerunning the same episodes of its Monday
prime-time show "Everwood," and its Tuesday hit "Smallville" on
Sunday nights.</TE>

<HD>Massachusetts Alleges CSFB Misled Investors</HD>
<DH>The complaint says bankers pressured stock analysts to
issue upbeat reports on clients.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint Monday alleging that
Credit Suisse First Boston intentionally misled investors by hyping
the stocks of companies for which the firm did investment banking
work.</LD>
<LD>   In an administrative complaint, the Massachusetts secretary of
state charged that CSFB bankers pressured technology stock analysts
to issue upbeat reports on CSFB clients and then pointed to that
bullishness when trying to win business from other companies.</LD>
<LD>   The charges revolve around a series of e-mails written by CSFB
analysts, some of whom appear to bemoan the pressure they felt to
talk up stocks of CSFB clients.</LD>
<TE>   In one e-mail, an analyst appears to admit giving a company a high
rating against his "better inclination" to avoid criticism from CSFB
investment bankers.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint "shows the culture of the company had a total
disregard for investors," William Galvin, the secretary of state,
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint seeks to separate CSFB's research and investment
banking divisions and enact other reforms. In settlement talks this
month, Massachusetts demanded that CSFB pay a fine of at least $100
million, sources said. CSFB, a unit of Credit Suisse Group, has 21
days to file a formal response to Monday's complaint.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, CSFB lashed out at the Massachusetts action,
saying it was "hastily initiated" and "riddled with misleading
statements and inaccuracies."</TE>
<TE>   "Secretary Galvin has offered no evidence that CSFB disseminated
false research reports to the public," the statement said.</TE>
<TE>   The action also angered some state and federal regulators, who
have been working to mold a "global" settlement with major firms to
resolve myriad government probes of Wall Street practices in the late
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The regulators say the best way to enact reforms is to reach a
single settlement rather than piecemeal deals.</TE>
<TE>   Other regulators asked Galvin to delay taking action against CSFB.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not helpful," said Christi Harlan, a Securities and Exchange
Commission spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, Galvin
has been praised for an aggressive stance that has forced federal
regulators to adopt a tough tone on analyst conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   But experts said Monday that the Massachusetts case could
complicate attempts at a global resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "I question whether this effort by Massachusetts makes sense at
this particularly sensitive time," said Henry Hu, a University of
Texas law professor.</TE>
<TE>   Galvin defended his case as "a catalyst toward a broader action."</TE>
<TE>   Though it did not name him as a defendant, the complaint took aim
at Frank Quattrone, the head of CSFB's technology banking department.
Under his leadership, the complaint alleges, the banking department
exerted enormous pressure on analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Quattrone did not return a phone call to his office, though CSFB
defended him in its statement.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar, Hughes Revise Merger Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an effort to save their proposed $18-billion satellite-TV merger,
EchoStar Communications Corp. and Hughes Electronics Corp. filed a
revised plan Monday with federal regulators that will clear the way
for new competition, said people familiar with the filing.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposal submitted to the Justice Department, EchoStar
and Hughes have agreed to sell broadcast spectrum to cable rival
Cablevision Systems Corp. Cablevision is planning to launch a limited
satellite-TV service next summer.</LD>
<LD>   Yet analysts wonder whether the Cablevision plan is too late. Two
weeks ago, the Federal Communications Commission blocked the merger
of EchoStar and Hughes, which owns DirecTV, because folding the
nation's only two satellite-TV providers into one company would
create a monopoly with limited consumer choice. Together, EchoStar
and DirecTV would serve nearly 20% of all American households.</LD>
<TE>   The FCC's formal decision, released Friday, indicated the
commissioners remain skeptical of any new satellite-TV rival emerging
because of the significant competitive hurdles. Critics of the
Cablevision plan also have questioned whether the nation's
seventh-largest cable company has the financial strength to become a
bona fide satellite-TV competitor. Cablevision also submitted a
proposal to the Justice Department on Monday as part of the effort,
according to people familiar with the filings.</TE>
<TE>   None of the parties involved would comment.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar and Hughes executives are scheduled to meet with the
Justice Department on Monday. Various reports have indicated that the
Justice Department also is leaning against the EchoStar-DirecTV deal.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new proposal, EchoStar is willing to sell satellite
slots that reach the West Coast, which would fill in blanks in
Cablevision's satellite configuration, a source said. Cablevision now
has spectrum that reaches mostly markets in the East and the Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's shares closed Monday at $17, up 6 cents, on Nasdaq.
Hughes' stock rose 10 cents to $8.97 on the New York Stock Exchange.
And Cablevision's shares closed at $9.31, up 53 cents, on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Gauge of Economic Prospects Decreases 0.2% in September</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>September's faltering stock market and increasing unemployment claims
dragged down a widely watched gauge of U.S. economic prospects, a
research group said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   It was the fourth consecutive monthly decline, but economists
downplayed the possibility that it portended a second recession in as
many years.</LD>
<LD>   The Conference Board reported that its index of leading economic
indicators fell 0.2%, matching Wall Street's expectations.</LD>
<TE>   The leading index, which tries to predict the strength of the
economy about six months ahead, stood at 111.6 in September.</TE>
<TE>   It stood at 100 in 1996, its base year.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group
in Pittsburgh, said the decline would "make some people nervous," but
there was no reason to conclude that the economy would go into a
"double-dip" recession.</TE>
<TE>   The index was affected mainly by the depressed stock market, which
is not necessarily an accurate predictor of the economy, Hoffman
said.</TE>
<TE>   The economy shrank for the first three quarters of last year,
meeting the measure of a recession, which is at least two straight
quarters of decline.</TE>
<TE>   After a strong showing at the beginning of this year, economic
growth slowed in the second quarter to just 1.3%, raising fears of a
second recession.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, various measures have portrayed contradicting
snapshots of the economy, painting an overall picture of a weak and
uncertain recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a volatile period, but the underlying economy is still
doing better than it was a year ago," said Gary Thayer, chief
economist at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   He cited as positive news the Conference Board's decision to
revise upward the leading indicators for July and August. The group
had said the index declined 0.4% and 0.2% in those months,
respectively, but Monday revised those numbers to declines of 0.2%
and 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   The coincident index, which measures the current economy, held
steady in September at 115.1.</TE>

<HD>El Paso Case Full of Twists and Turns</HD>
<DH>State PUC suspected firm's selling of pipeline capacity to
affiliate was a conflict of interest, but its complaint sat while gas
prices soared.</DH>
<SE>Second of two parts</SE>
<AU>Myron Levin and Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one was talking about a California energy crisis in spring 2000.
But officials at the state Public Utilities Commission thought they
smelled a rat.</LD>
<LD>   El Paso Corp., owner of the biggest natural-gas pipeline serving
California, had just sold a giant swath of pipeline capacity to its
own gas-marketing company, El Paso Merchant Energy. The utility
watchdogs at the PUC saw it as a classic conflict of interest. The
pipeline company, they worried, might be inclined to pinch gas
deliveries to California if that would raise prices for its marketing
arm.</LD>
<LD>   Fearing shenanigans, they filed a stern protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission -- but even then never imagined how bad
things would get.</LD>
<TE>   By May, gas prices took off. "All of a sudden, we're thinking, 'Oh
my God, if we're getting killed in the summer, we're dead meat in the
winter,' " recalled Harvey Morris, a senior attorney at the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   But the complaint to FERC sat, and while it sat, the energy crisis
struck with full fury, with rising gas prices contributing to
astronomical power costs.</TE>
<TE>   A judge's ruling last month that El Paso deliberately squeezed
pipeline capacity to jack up prices was, in essence, a vindication of
fears raised before there was any sign of trouble. The decision also
could be a major turning point in the investigation of possible
corporate wrongdoing in the California energy crisis of 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   If upheld by FERC, the ruling by Administrative Law Judge Curtis
L. Wagner Jr. could help the state recover a portion of the $9
billion it has demanded in refunds for alleged electricity
overcharges. Because many of the state's generators are powered by
natural gas, its price is a key part of the cost of electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the decision came down to simple math.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso's pipeline has the capacity to ship 3.29 billion cubic
feet of natural gas a day to Southern California. Yet during the
depths of the energy crisis -- a critical period from November 2000
to March 2001 -- Wagner found that the average flow was only 2.59
billion cubic feet a day, or 79% of capacity. The difference -- 696
million cubic feet a day -- would have been enough to heat about 3
million homes, or produce electricity for about 700,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   With gas prices in California running two to three times higher
than in the rest of the country, gas marketers would have been
expected to eagerly snap up any available capacity that would let
them sell in California. Interstate pipelines are legally obliged to
move gas shipments between marketers and users, and are ordinarily
motivated to ship as much gas as possible, because they charge for
each unit they transport. But on the El Paso pipeline, the usual
dynamics were skewed, according to documents filed with FERC. The
reason: the great chunk of capacity that came under El Paso
Merchant's control.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso, the nation's largest pipeline operator, has vehemently
denied manipulating prices, and has launched a fight to have the
ruling overturned by FERC commissioners. Among other things, the
company contends that safety concerns forced it to operate the
pipeline conservatively, limiting gas deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with the market-manipulation strategies of fallen energy
giant Enron Corp. -- whose former top electricity trader in the West
pleaded guilty last week to driving up prices with schemes such as
"Death Star" and "Get Shorty" -- El Paso's role in the power crisis
is not so clear-cut.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the case against El Paso comes down more to circumstantial
evidence than smoking-gun proof of wrongdoing. El Paso's story --
which has been reconstructed by The Times from interviews and
testimony and documents filed with FERC -- twists and turns like the
thousands of miles of plumbing that carry the company's natural gas
to California.</TE>
<TE>   The FERC case has now dragged on for more than 2 1/2 years. The
boom-and-bust story of the El Paso pipeline spans most of a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Skewed Dynamics</TE>
<TE>   El Paso is the most dominant player on the natural-gas grid, with
ownership of 58,000, or nearly one third, of the 180,000 pipeline
miles in the U.S. Yet at times, its line to California seemed more a
white elephant than gold mine.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 1996, the line had been drowning in excess
capacity. Then, as now, there were four pipelines serving California,
with El Paso claiming about 40% of the total capacity. Two of its
smaller competitors--the Kern River pipeline and the Pacific Gas
Transmission Co. pipeline -- usually ran close to full because they
carried cheap gas from the Rockies and Canada. Because El Paso tapped
older, more expensive wells in the Southwest, its pipeline often went
begging.</TE>
<TE>   A pipeline makes its money on two basic types of service. It sells
"firm capacity" to marketers willing to make upfront payments to
assure priority for their shipments. It also sells "interruptible"
service to customers that pay only when they ship and take the risk
that there won't be space when they need it.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-90s, several of El Paso's biggest customers, including
PG&amp;E Corp. and Southern California Gas Co., relinquished more than
1.5 billion cubic feet -- nearly half of the pipeline's capacity --
because of changes in the market spurred by deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, a settlement was reached to cushion the effect on El Paso
and assure it could cover its costs. The customers that relinquished
capacity agreed to pay El Paso $255 million.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, El Paso began looking for new customers for the 1.5
billion cubic feet, nearly half of the pipeline's capacity, that had
been returned. But along the way, El Paso locked horns with the
California PUC.</TE>
<TE>   The company's practice, to this point, had been to discount
transportation charges to interruptible customers -- those paying
only when they ship. Such discounts accomplished two things:
attracting shippers and income when regular firm customers weren't
moving gas; and preventing firm customers from gaming the market by
withholding gas.</TE>
<TE>   But in a deal that took effect in January 1998, El Paso stood
custom on its ear. It sold 1.3 billion cubic feet of firm capacity to
Dynegy Inc. As part of the deal, Dynegy had the right to reduce
payments to El Paso as interruptible sales increased. Suddenly,
without an incentive to promote such sales, El Paso eliminated the
traditional discounts for its interruptible customers.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC claimed this made it easier for Dynegy to hoard pipeline
capacity and put upward pressure on prices.</TE>
<TE>   For Dynegy, the strategy brought some success. During the warm
winter of 1998, demand for gas was weak. As a result, a price
component called the "basis spread" -- the markup on gas between the
source of supply and the delivery point -- dropped almost everywhere.
An exception was California, where spreads doubled from an average of
17 cents to 36 cents per 1,000 cubic feet of gas, according to
documents filed with FERC.</TE>
<TE>   The PUC, joined by Southern California Edison and a gas marketing
firm, protested the Dynegy-El Paso pact to FERC. The commission
agreed the clause in the Dynegy contract was anti-competitive, but
refused to throw it out. According to FERC, the deal had helped
shelter El Paso from the earlier loss of the firm customers, and had
not had much effect on price.</TE>
<TE>   In February 2000, Dynegy's contract expired. But what happened
next would again set off alarms for state regulators, this time even
louder than before.</TE>
<TE>   Preferential Treatment?</TE>
<TE>   After the Dynegy pact ended, El Paso put 1.2 billion cubic feet of
firm pipeline capacity up for sale. Twenty-four firms bid for a cut
of that, but only El Paso Merchant made an offer for it all.
Moreover, Merchant's bid of $38.5 million was more than double the
combined offers of the other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Merchant won the bidding and suddenly controlled 35% of the
capacity of its pipeline affiliate, far more than any other shipper.
But there was more to Merchant's winning bid than simply offering the
most money.</TE>
<TE>   A few days before the deadline for bids, Merchant Vice President
Robin Cox contacted an official of the Mojave Pipeline Co., another
El Paso affiliate. Through a connection in Arizona with the main El
Paso pipeline, the Mojave line provided an important alternative
route for moving gas into Southern California if bottlenecks
developed.</TE>
<TE>   Cox arranged a discount for shipments on that line, according to
e-mails and logs filed with FERC, and also persuaded Mojave not to
post the discount until the day after the bidding for the 1.2 billion
cubic feet of capacity closed. Once announced, the price break would
be available to all shippers. But without knowing in advance, as
Merchant did, other firms were unable to factor it into their bids.</TE>
<TE>   FERC regulations prohibit pipelines from giving preferential
treatment to a sister firm. Under the regulations, when a pipeline
gives information to an affiliate, "it must provide that information
contemporaneously to all potential shippers." It would later be
determined by Wagner that El Paso had violated FERC rules in the
run-up to the auction.</TE>
<TE>   Yet at the time it filed its protest with FERC in spring 2000, the
PUC had no inkling of the contacts between Merchant and Mojave. To
the PUC, the mere existence of the deal put the state at risk.</TE>
<TE>   According to the PUC, Merchant alone could afford to bid on the
entire capacity, though it had no market for that much gas. Other
bidders knew that if they won the capacity, El Paso would be
motivated to again start promoting interruptible sales, as it had
done in the days before the Dynegy deal. But by the PUC's reasoning,
Merchant knew the pipeline would not do this with its affiliate's
profit at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Therefore, the PUC alleged, Merchant's motive was "to exercise
market power and artificially drive up prices by depriving
competitors of heavily discounted rates." Edison and PG&amp;E soon
entered the case on the PUC's side.</TE>
<TE>   At first, the rhetoric far outstripped any tangible evidence of a
problem. But that was about to change, thanks to a confluence of
adverse events.</TE>
<TE>   Pipeline Not at Capacity</TE>
<TE>   By spring 2000, the state's economic growth was boosting
electricity demand. But for several years, power plant construction
had been almost at a standstill. And as the air conditioning season
approached, dry weather throughout the West was limiting the supply
of hydroelectric power from California and the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   That meant gas-fired units would be running overtime. Predictably,
prices began climbing.</TE>
<TE>   For gas shipped from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to the
California border, the basis spread rose from 32 cents per 1,000
cubic feet April 1 to $1.48 by mid-August. For gas from the Permian
Basin in Texas, the spread widened from 27 cents April 1 to 59 cents
by mid-August. By July, spot prices at the California border were the
highest in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   One Edison analysis shows that during the first three months of
the El Paso contract, Merchant used far less of its capacity than did
other firm shippers. From June to October 2000, as prices rose,
Merchant used only 54% of its capacity, well below the activity of
other shippers. Even after Dec. 1, with prices soaring, Merchant's
77% utilization trailed other shippers, documents indicate.</TE>
<TE>   In August, September and then again in October, the PUC filed
petitions urging FERC to act on its complaint. The message was
simple: "We're going to be in real trouble this winter ... You've got
to do something," Morris, the PUC lawyer, recounted.</TE>
<TE>   But the winter came and went without action. Natural-gas prices
increased throughout the country, but nowhere as much as in
California. Price spreads, which in ordinary times were less than 50
cents, peaked at nearly $50 in December 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Brattle Group, a consulting firm hired by Edison,
the withholding of pipeline capacity had raised gas costs about $3.7
billion from March 2000 to March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   A year after the PUC complaint, FERC set the case for a hearing
before Wagner. The action came March 28, 2001, two days after an
article in the New York Times quoted sealed documents El Paso had
turned over.</TE>
<TE>   One document was a presentation by Merchant officials to El Paso
Corp. Chief Executive William A. Wise on Valentine's Day 2000, as
Merchant was preparing to make its bid. According to the document,
the deal would give the firm "more control" of gas markets. Another
memo, dated April 14, 2000, from Merchant President Greg G. Jenkins
to Wise reportedly said: "We will make money two ways: 1) increase
the load factor 2) widen the basis spread."</TE>
<TE>   Decision Favors El Paso</TE>
<TE>   During the hearings before Wagner, El Paso Merchant executive
Ralph Eads testified that Merchant had made a profit of $184 million
since buying the capacity on its sister company's pipeline. But by
the reckoning of its accusers, Merchant did even better than that.</TE>
<TE>   The company also had invested in 15 California alternative-energy
plants, which delivered power to the electrical grid at prices pegged
to the cost of natural gas. According to the Brattle Group analysis,
withholding of pipeline capacity had allowed those plants to make an
extra $86.2 million, adding to Merchant's bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   Altogether, Brattle contended, Merchant had overcharged customers
more than $900 million. The company denied overcharging, and said it
also lost large sums on certain "hedge" sales that locked it into
below-market prices.</TE>
<TE>   Other evidence showed that during the critical period of November
2000 to March 2001, only small volumes of interruptible shipments had
flowed on the pipeline -- despite the potent incentive of generous
price spreads. Referring to an El Paso chart in which interruptible
sales were shown as a series of tiny red dots, PG&amp;E lawyer Frank
Lindh declared: "Those are droplets of blood on the defendant's
socks, Your Honor."</TE>
<TE>   During a session in August 2001, Wagner blasted the contacts
between Merchant and Mojave. "If that's not hanky-panky," the judge
said, "there's no such thing as hanky-panky."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the judge's first decision, on Oct. 9, 2001, largely
favored El Paso. He found El Paso and Merchant were guilty of
"blatant collusion" for the secret Mojave discount. But on the most
critical question -- whether the firms had exercised "market power,"
unilaterally influencing supply and price -- he came down on El
Paso's side.</TE>
<TE>   "While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability
to exercise market power, the record in this case is not at all clear
that they did," Wagner said. Of significance, he said, was that the
pipeline was running full or nearly full during the time of greatest
need. On this, Wagner said, "all parties agree."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, the judge had overlooked a serious disagreement
on that very point.</TE>
<TE>   Conduct Challenged</TE>
<TE>   The PUC and its allies mainly had focused on the conduct of
Merchant, rather than the pipeline itself. Yet evidence had been
presented that gas deliveries were far below the pipeline's maximum
capacity of 3.29 billion cubic feet per day.</TE>
<TE>   According to the PUC and others, it's possible that the operating
data were obscured by the blizzard of reports and statistics. The PUC
filed objections. But even before its appeal was filed, FERC staff
joined in challenging the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "The record suggests that [unused] capacity existed on the
pipeline," the staff said in a report, adding that "even small
amounts of unused capacity can affect prices during a period of
supply-demand imbalance."</TE>
<TE>   "Prices at the Southern California border were very high," the
report said, "raising the question whether the pipeline made all
unused capacity available to interruptible shippers."</TE>
<TE>   The staff recommended "a more complete investigation," and on Dec.
27, FERC ordered Wagner to take another look, setting the stage for a
second round of hearings in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   This time, El Paso's opponents focused on evidence that the
pipeline had shipped an average of 2.594 billion cubic feet per day
to California, just 79% of its capacity. During the same period, El
Paso's critics said, interruptible customers had faced unusual
difficulties in getting the firm to accept their shipments.</TE>
<TE>   The capacity shortfall of 696 million cubic feet reflected a
"stunningly inadequate performance during a crisis of uniquely,
punishingly high natural-gas prices in California," Edison lawyer
Kevin Lipson said during oral arguments on April 10.</TE>
<TE>   The company offered its own explanation for the shortfall. It said
270 million cubic feet a day was due to a federal safety order to
operate more cautiously in the wake of a company pipeline explosion
in New Mexico that killed 12. Some 95 million was due to maintenance,
and 100 million was due to the failure of regular shippers to fully
utilize their capacity. El Paso attributed the remainder to
stronger-than-expected demand from customers east of the California
border, which forced it to curtail capacity for all its firm
shippers.</TE>
<TE>   "An honest disagreement amongst [expert witnesses] doesn't come
anywhere near meeting the burden of proof that what the El Paso
pipeline did was unreasonable," Bill Scherman, attorney for Merchant
and former FERC general counsel, said in closing arguments.</TE>
<TE>   But FERC had produced evidence that suggested otherwise. It had
assigned a veteran engineer to study the pipeline operation. Robert
Flanders found an alternative route for shipping gas -- a
"workaround" -- that he said should have allowed the company to
counteract some of the lingering effects of the New Mexico explosion.</TE>
<TE>   He testified that as much as 100 million cubic feet a day of flow
could have been restored by using this route. However, El Paso did
not inform its shippers that the option was available.</TE>
<TE>   "We're there to transport what our shippers tell us they want
transported," testified William Healy, a vice president of the
pipeline. "It's really not my place to tell them where they should go
[to] get gas." El Paso also argued that Flanders' bypass route was
unworkable for technical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Flanders disagreed. "It's incumbent ... on the pipeline to advise
their shippers," he testified. "It's ... that kind of careful
coordination of pipeline operations and shipper behavior that enables
a pipeline to achieve a maximum design capacity."</TE>
<TE>   Markup Falls 96%</TE>
<TE>   The judge sided with the enforcement staff. That accounted for 100
million cubic feet a day of the 345 million that Wagner would
specifically accuse the pipeline of withholding.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner also agreed that California was shortchanged out of another
210 million cubic feet a day because El Paso operated the pipeline at
below-maximum-design pressures, so less gas would be pushed through
the system. El Paso has countered that it would have been risky to
run the pipeline any harder.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Wagner found that El Paso scheduled non-emergency
maintenance work at times of peak demand, causing a loss of an
additional 35 million cubic feet of gas that could have come into
California.</TE>
<TE>   The total came to an average of 345 million cubic feet a day --
enough to heat an estimated 1.5 million homes -- though Wagner said
the amount of withheld capacity was "perhaps much much more."</TE>
<TE>   The standard of proof required to find a violation in a regulatory
proceeding is not "beyond a reasonable doubt," as in criminal cases,
but "substantial evidence." The question of intent becomes more
important in assessing a penalty, which can include the return of
ill-gotten profit.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of a showdown before the full FERC--which can still
overturn Wagner's ruling -- El Paso has mounted a vigorous
public-relations campaign, saying it has been made a scapegoat for
problems caused by supply-and-demand factors and policy blunders by
California's leaders. California's poorly designed deregulation plan
and its failure to build new power plants are what really caused its
energy market to implode, El Paso says.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome of the dispute, California no longer need
worry about the alliance between the pipeline and Merchant. When the
deal expired Merchant opted not to renew the contract.</TE>
<TE>   The capacity wound up being divided among some 30 shippers. And in
a short time, the markup on natural gas shipped to California from
gas fields in Texas fell 96%.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar-TV Guide in SEC Probe of Accounting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc., reeling from a raft of
accounting concerns, disclosed late Monday that it is the subject of
a formal Securities and Exchange Commission probe.</LD>
<LD>   A leading provider of electronic TV program guides, Gemstar said
the SEC issued the formal order Oct. 17, allowing regulators to
subpoena individuals and entities while digging for additional
information. Gemstar previously had discussed the results of an
internal accounting review with the SEC, and the Pasadena-based firm
said Monday it intends to "fully cooperate" as the probe progresses.</LD>
<LD>   The firm was considered a technology highflier on Wall Street just
two years ago, but its stock value has plummeted 96% since then,
suffering from questionable accounting practices and court rulings
that undermined the company's patents for on-screen programming
guides.</LD>
<TE>   Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. first invested in the company during
the technology boom in 1999 and has been forced to take write-downs
of nearly $6 billion since March to deal with Gemstar's decline.
Gemstar delayed its second-quarter earnings in August and said it
would restate its 2001 results after an internal review.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing the review, the company said it intended to restate
2001 earnings by reducing revenue from its TV Guide subsidiary by
about $20 million. Gemstar said its audit committee also would
examine revenue accounting practices for "certain other transactions"
and the allocation of revenue in its interactive-platform division
and media-and-services division.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar then failed to certify its financial results by the SEC's
Aug. 14 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp. recently wrested control of the company from its
founder, Henry Yuen, and installed one of its own executives. Yuen
and his chief financial officer, Elsie Leung, agreed to step down in
exchange for huge severance packages.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar's disclosure Monday came after the stock markets closed.
Its shares dropped 9 cents to $3.57 in after-hours trading on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Global to Restate Most 2001 Results</HD>
<DH>Firm says move would erase $19 million in revenue. Analyst
calls news 'anticlimactic.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from federal regulators, Global Crossing Ltd. said
Monday it would restate financial results for the first nine months
of 2001 to exclude revenue from controversial network capacity deals
with other carriers.</LD>
<LD>   The telecommunications company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection in January, said the move would erase $19 million in
revenue for the first three quarters of last year and would wipe out
$1.2 billion each in assets and liabilities from its balance sheet.</LD>
<LD>   The restatement also would increase the company's nine-month net
loss by $13 million, to about $4.8 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Global Crossing's changes are largely irrelevant to investors,
since the company's stock and other securities lost virtually all of
their value when the company entered Bankruptcy Court. In fact, the
company has yet to file -- or certify -- full-year results for 2001
or even replace its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen, which stopped
performing audits after being found guilty of obstruction of justice
in a case involving Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting practices at Global Crossing, Qwest Communications
International Inc. and other carriers have been under investigation
by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The probes have focused on the way the companies booked revenue from
reciprocal transactions, or deals in which two carriers essentially
exchanged like amounts of fiber-optic capacity and then simply
"round-tripped" cash payments.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Comack, a telecommunications analyst at Guzman &amp; Co.,
called Global Crossing's announcement "anticlimactic" and added that
the $19 million "sounds like it's the tip of the swap iceberg."</TE>
<TE>   John Legere, Global Crossing's current chief executive, has
testified before congressional panels probing the capacity deals,
saying the accounting practices at the company were widely accepted
in the industry. Legere and other Global Crossing executives declined
to comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The transactions added only a fraction of each deal's value to
quarterly revenue statements. But the deals had a far greater effect
on Global Crossing's pro forma financial figures -- numbers that the
company stressed in press releases and analyst presentations and that
were watched closely by Global Crossing's lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing chose not to release revised figures for the pro
forma numbers from 2001. Instead, the company said the pro forma
results it reported last year "should now be disregarded."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, a bankruptcy judge agreed to extend Global
Crossing's exclusive right to present and approve a reorganization
plan, a move that will further delay the submission and review of any
competing reorganization plans.</TE>

<HD>HCA Profit Falls 26.7% on Charges From Investments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>HCA Inc., the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, on Monday
said its profit fell 26.7% in the third quarter but its results
before special items rose 41% and beat Wall Street expectations.</LD>
<LD>   HCA posted a net income of $200 million, or 38 cents a share, for
the quarter ended Sept. 30, down from $273 million, or 51 cents a
share, a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   But excluding special items, earnings rose to $319 million, or 60
cents a share, from $226 million, or 43 cents a share, last year.</LD>
<TE>   Thomson First Call analysts had predicted earnings of 55 cents per
share before charges.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter increased 11.1% from $4.4 billion last
year to $4.9 billion, and same-facility revenue increased 12.2% while
volume rose 3.4%.</TE>
<TE>   The charges in the latest quarter included a $107-million
reduction on the value of investment securities and $12 million
related to a long investigation.</TE>
<TE>   HCA operates 181 hospitals and 78 emergency surgery centers in 22
states, including California. Shares of HCA declined 15 cents to
$50.51 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Executives of Homestore Enter Guilty Pleas</HD>
<DH>Pair admit to being part of a plot to drive up revenue
figures, then exercise stock options.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two former Homestore Inc. executives pleaded guilty Monday to roles
in a conspiracy to inflate revenue at the Internet real estate
company, a scheme that enabled the company to satisfy Wall Street
that it was growing robustly, allowing the executives and others to
exercise millions of dollars' worth of stock options.</LD>
<LD>   John Giesecke Jr. and Joseph J. Shew, chief operating officer and
chief financial officer, respectively, of Westlake Village-based
Homestore when the scheme unfolded in 2001, were among seven top
executives who quit or were fired after the plot came to light late
last year.</LD>
<LD>   The pair, who say they weren't the instigators of the conspiracy,
assured U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson repeatedly that they were
voluntarily giving up their rights to trial.</LD>
<TE>   Shew was the first to cooperate with prosecutors and the
Securities and Exchange Commission when the scheme began unraveling
last November, attorneys said. Within days, he was joined by Giesecke
and another former Homestore finance executive, John DeSimone, who is
scheduled to enter his guilty plea next week.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael Wilner told Anderson the conspiracy
involved additional participants at Homestore, the Web's leading real
estate listings site, and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   People involved in the investigation have said the probe is
focused on former Homestore Chief Executive Stuart Wolff, former
Executive Vice President Peter Tafeen and a number of partners that
generated revenue for the company, including AOL Time Warner Inc.,
one of its two major partners.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Tafeen and Wolff have acknowledged that their clients
are under investigation but denied wrongdoing; AOL, facing probes
into its own accounting by the SEC and the U.S. attorney in
Alexandria, Va., has denied systematic wrongdoing but acknowledged
that a former manager forced out last year might have participated in
the plot.The federal criminal case accuses Homestore of purchasing
high-priced services from vendors on the unspoken condition that they
spend most of the money on ads at AOL, which in turn bought ads on
Homestore sites.</TE>
<TE>   The scheme allowed Homestore "to recognize its own cash as
revenue" in violation of accounting standards, Assistant U.S. Atty.
Douglas Fuchs said.</TE>
<TE>   Homestore's other major partner was Cendant Corp., whose chief
executive, Henry Silverman, told analysts last month that his company
is not a target of the Homestore investigation.</TE>
<TE>   However, sources close to the investigation said Monday the
government is scrutinizing New York-based Cendant, whose brands
include Century 21, Coldwell Banker and ERA. Cendant executives
couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Giesecke, 42, of Malibu, faces a 10-year prison sentence and
$500,000 fine under the terms of his agreement to plead guilty to
fraud and conspiracy. Shew, 37, of West Chester, Pa., could be
sentenced to five years and a $250,000 fine for conspiracy.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Seeks to Seize Family's Proceeds</HD>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>U.S. authorities Monday filed a civil lawsuit seeking forfeiture of
almost $10 million in proceeds from alleged insider trading by the
family of former ImClone Systems Inc. Chief Executive Samuel D.
Waksal.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors asked a judge to authorize the seizure of $9.7
million in trading profits in four separate accounts controlled by
Waksal's parents, Jack and Sabina, and his daughter, Aliza, according
to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   The suit contends that there is probable cause to believe that the
money is "derived from proceeds traceable to an offense."</LD>
<TE>   Waksal, 55, pleaded guilty last week to insider trading charges,
admitting that he had confidential information that the Food and Drug
Administration would reject ImClone's application for Erbitux, a
highly touted cancer drug, on Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's decision sent the company's shares plummeting from
prices that had topped $75 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal told U.S. District Judge William Pauley that he called his
daughter in Idaho on the morning of Dec. 27 and instructed her to
sell $2.47 million in ImClone shares immediately. Waksal said he
didn't tell her the true reason for his call "in an effort not to
implicate her in any unlawful or improper conduct." Within minutes,
she called to execute the sale, records show.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Waksal, 80, also sold $8.27 million in shares Dec. 27 and
Dec. 28, prosecutors said. Authorities said that phone records
indicate several phone calls between Samuel Waksal and his father on
the evening of Dec. 26. Neither Jack nor Aliza Waksal have been
charged.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Waksal's family sold $10.65 million worth of ImClone
shares in December, the civil forfeiture papers say. Waksal's family
members have not been indicted.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, prosecutors warned that Waksal's plea would not protect
Waksal or family members from possible charges.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for Jack Waksal, Charles Stillman, declined to comment
on the forfeiture suit. Aliza Waksal's attorney, Abbe Lowell, also
declined to comment, saying he had not seen the suit.</TE>

<HD>Intel Puts Its Money on Wireless Internet</HD>
<DH>Chip maker hopes laptops eventually will 'have anytime,
anywhere' Web access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Betting that demand for mobile Internet access will help drive sales
of chips for laptop computers, Intel Corp. said Monday that it will
boost investment in wireless start-ups substantially over the next
several years.</LD>
<LD>   The world's largest semiconductor company is seeding the market
for its newest laptop chip, to be released early next year.
Code-named Banias, the chip will have built-in ability to tap into
wireless networks.</LD>
<LD>   By increasing its investments in outside companies to $150 million
from $25 million, Intel hopes to promote a more robust wireless
infrastructure that will support its next generation of products.</LD>
<TE>   "The goal is to have anytime, anywhere computing," said Sriram
Viswanathan, managing director of broadband and wireless networking
for Intel Capital, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel's venture capital
investment arm.</TE>
<TE>   With desktop sales slowing, Intel is turning to the laptop market
for growth. Although U.S. desktop shipments are forecast to fall 3.7%
in volume this year, laptop shipments are expected to grow 14.6%,
according to technology research firm IDC.</TE>
<TE>   "The real opportunities for Intel are in notebooks," said Alan
Promisel, an IDC analyst. "So it's in their best interest to promote
wireless Internet as much as possible in order to help drive mobile
processor shipments."</TE>
<TE>   Wireless networks, while still nascent, are starting to roll out
in hotels, airports and restaurants. Starbucks Corp., for example,
sells wireless service at more than 1,000 of its shops for $29.99 a
month, or $2.99 for 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The service uses a technology called Wi-Fi, which allows users to
connect wirelessly to a high-speed access point.</TE>
<TE>   But the networks, called "hot spots," are far from ubiquitous, and
most people are unclear about how the service works.</TE>
<TE>   "It'll be three to five years before we can expect mainstream
consumers to access the Internet this way," said Charles Golvin,
senior analyst for Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. "One
of the biggest impediments is that there aren't too many people
running around with devices with Wi-Fi capabilities. Another barrier
is the pricing. With service running up to $70 a month, it's just
priced beyond what average consumers are willing to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Another hurdle is billing. With thousands of independently
operated hot spots, laptop owners face multiple bills for access.
Several firms, including Boingo Wireless Inc. and IPass Inc., seek to
solve that problem by consolidating hot spots so that users receive a
single bill.</TE>
<TE>   Intel, which has invested more than $4 billion in the last decade
through Intel Capital to further the company's overall strategic
goals, plans to fund small companies that help solve these issues and
speed up consumer adoption of wireless Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   Intel shares closed up 99 cents to $15.45 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>Sports Agent Tackles Ex-Protege in Court</HD>
<DH>Steinberg Trial Brings Out Unseemly Accusations</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of the romantic comedy "Jerry Maguire" could be excused if they
do a double-take over a legal feud now playing out in Los Angeles
federal court.</LD>
<LD>   The popular 1996 movie, starring Tom Cruise, features a character
loosely based on Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg who
strikes out on his own to represent athletes, eventually finding
redemption in love and business.</LD>
<LD>   But in real life, roles are reversed. Steinberg -- considered an
early pioneer as a sports agent -- is suing former protege David Dunn
for striking out on his own to build a rival firm to Steinberg's
empire.</LD>
<TE>   Like the movie, the case playing out in U.S. District Judge Ronald
S.W. Lew's courtroom offers a window into a highly competitive realm
of the sports world that is filled with intrigue and back-biting.</TE>
<TE>   It has featured an appearance by former quarterback Warren Moon,
and promises more testimony, live or videotaped, from current players
such as Buffalo Bills quarterback Drew Bledsoe and Kansas City Chiefs
receiver Johnnie Morton about their decision to fire Steinberg and
join Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the $40-million lawsuit, however, are questions
that apply to even the most prosaic of businesses. What loyalty does
an employee owe an employer? Where do personal friendships stop and
business interests start?</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg, 53, has accused Dunn, 41, and his associates of
stealing more than 50 of his 84 football clients and then threatening
blackmail if Steinberg sued. Steinberg did that last year, alleging
false advertising, intentional interference with players' contracts,
unfair competition and conspiracy. He also has filed a grievance
against 47 of the pro players, seeking about $3 million in fees.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Dunn's attorneys say it was their client who was
betrayed when the firm's parent company, Assante Corp. of Canada,
failed to give him millions of dollars in guaranteed stock as
promised. Dunn has counter-sued Steinberg for invasion of privacy and
false advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome, Steinberg's public image has taken a
beating. The author of "Winning With Integrity: Getting What You Want
Without Selling Your Soul" has been portrayed in court records and
testimony as an alcoholic and a mercurial manager who lost his
recruiting touch. Steinberg testified he has battled alcoholism but
said he's still an effective agent.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Berkeley with a law degree in 1974,
Steinberg operated out of his parents' Los Angeles home. From there,
he snagged his first client, former dorm mate Steve Bartkowski. A
quarterback, Bartkowski was the first pick in the 1975 draft, and
went on to sign what was then the largest rookie contract in league
history.</TE>
<TE>   The instant fanfare that followed -- and hard work -- led to more
success for Steinberg. He soon had an impressive base of A-list
clients, including quarterbacks Steve Young, Troy Aikman and Jeff
George.</TE>
<TE>   By then, Steinberg had taken on a partner, Jeff Moorad, to branch
out into baseball. But the firm's core business was the gridiron, and
Steinberg hired a close friend to help with the task of beating out
dozens of other agents for new recruits -- a close friend named David
Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   "Outside of my family, he was really the best friend I had in the
world," Steinberg testified. "And I would have trusted him with my
life."</TE>
<TE>   A product liability lawyer with no prior sports recruiting
experience, Dunn was at first assigned "client maintenance" --
helping players with a variety of problems -- then quickly moved into
contract negotiations. He rose to become a partner in charge of the
football practice by 1999, when Assante struck a deal to buy the
firm, then known as Steinberg, Moorad &amp; Dunn, for $74 million.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sign of how the sports agent business was changing. No
longer satisfied with fixed commissions, such as the 3% on football
players' earnings, sports agencies were looking for deep pockets to
help them leverage their contacts, including the development of
"content supply" for television shows and video games.</TE>
<TE>   The Winnipeg, Canada-based financial services firm coveted the
agency's association with the high-priced athletes and considered
Steinberg and his partners, Dunn and Moorad, to be key "assets" in
the transaction.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really what you're buying, is the people and the
relationships," testified former Assante corporate secretary Anita
Wortzman.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records and testimony, Assante wanted the
option to extend Dunn's five-year contract for an additional three
years. If he decided not to renew his agreement and leave the firm,
Assante required Dunn not to compete or lure away clients for up to 2
years after his departure. In exchange, it guaranteed him $2.5
million in stock.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion over the final terms -- Dunn believed he would receive
at least some of the stock up front -- prompted the agent to call
Assante headquarters the night before the merger was announced.
Assante Chief Executive Martin Weinberg urged Dunn to "take a leap of
faith" and trust the details would be ironed out after the merger,
according to testimony and documents. The matter dragged on for a
year, causing Dunn to beg for a resolution, according to court
records.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past four or five months I have pleaded with you to
address the finalizing of my deal and the stock component of my
compensation," Dunn wrote Wortzman in an Oct. 20, 2001 e-mail entered
into evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's contract woes came on top of complaints about Steinberg's
drinking, testimony and documents show. Among those allegedly
unhappy: Bledsoe, one of the firm's star clients, who met with Dunn
for dinner in January 2001 and expressed "distaste" over how
Steinberg behaved at a 1996 party in the quarterback's home.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe encouraged Dunn to go out on his own, suggesting "a lot of
guys would go with you," Dunn testified. Dunn mentioned the
conversation to Brian Murphy, a fellow football agent who had
expressed his own frustrations with Steinberg. On Jan. 21, 2001,
Murphy penned a lengthy memo describing the agency as a
"dysfunctional firm that is headed on a downward spiral."</TE>
<TE>   The memo, recovered from Murphy's company computer and entered by
Steinberg's attorneys as evidence of a blackmail effort, also paints
the agent as a glory-monger who skimps on the work but shows up at
news conferences to take credit for big deals. "The entire firm knows
that he is useless and we all work around him," Murphy wrote.</TE>
<TE>   And in what has become key language in the suit, Murphy added that
Steinberg has "lots of secrets" which could "prove to be useful in
negotiating a settlement.... If we wanted to, we could rip apart his
marriage, his reputation and his career."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy alleged that he once had to pay a Las Vegas prostitute to
recover Steinberg's wallet. At trial, Steinberg acknowledged that his
wallet was taken from him and had to be retrieved from a woman in Las
Vegas. He called it "an embarrassing incident" but denied spending
the night with an escort.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn, Murphy and others shocked the firm by resigning en masse in
February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Wortzman testified that a couple of days later, Murphy called her
at home to say that the exodus would take away "70% to 80% of the NFL
client base." Wortzman said that when she protested that such a move
violated the non-compete contracts, Murphy argued that any legal
action could reveal "some very negative information that would be
very embarrassing" to Steinberg and Assante.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'That sounds like blackmail,' " Wortzman said. Dunn's
attorneys contend that Murphy wasn't making a threat but explaining
that any lawsuit would force them to air their gripes about
Steinberg.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts at negotiation failed. Within a few months, Steinberg,
Moorad &amp; Dunn's roster of pro football players was decimated as
dozens of athletes defected to Dunn's group, which was incorporated
as Athletes First. Overnight, the new firm became a major sports
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's attorneys contend that Bledsoe, Morton and others insisted
that the decision to follow Dunn was of their own free will, and that
Athletes First didn't violate any football recruiting rules as
outlined by the National Football League Players Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Steinberg has testified that he has faced backlash from the split
that has made it difficult to sign new clients. His firm now
represents 18 pro football players. But Steinberg is more than
willing to press on with the messy lawsuit and settle the score in
court, his attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a wounded lion," said lead attorney Franklin Brockway
"Brock" Gowdy of San Francisco, "but he's still a lion."</TE>

<HD>Kmart's Sales for September Decline 6.9%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Discount retailer Kmart Corp. on Monday posted a smaller drop in
sales at stores open at least one year as a new marketing program
began to pay off, and stood by its plan to emerge from bankruptcy
protection by July 2003.</LD>
<LD>   In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
Kmart said same-store sales fell 6.9% for the five-week period ended
Oct. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Since the company filed for Chapter 11 in January, citing weak
holiday sales and stiff competition, monthly same-store sales
declines have averaged 11%. August same-store sales dropped 11.9%,
and July's were down 13.8%.</LD>
<TE>   Total September sales for the four-week month ended Sept. 25
reached $1.967 billion, while the loss for the month stood at $176
million. Retailers report comparable-store sales on a different
calendar than total monthly sales.</TE>
<TE>   September was a tough month for most U.S. retailers as warm
weather crimped demand for winter clothing and a weak economy kept
consumers frugal.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart, caught between Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s low-price dominance
and Target Corp.'s strength in customer service, has pinned its hopes
on find- ing a niche in the Hispanic and African American

<TE>   Richard Hastings, chief economist and retail sector analyst with
Cyber Business Credit, said despite the improving trend, Kmart and
other discounters may continue to struggle because lower-income
consumers have been hit especially hard by a weakening economy and
slow job market.</TE>
<TE>   Julian Day, president and chief operating officer, credited a new
marketing program for at least some of the improvement.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart launched a campaign it calls "Have to Have It" in Chicago
and Detroit, focusing on promoting certain items and making sure they
were in stock -- something that had been a problem for Kmart leading
up to the bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   September same-store sales in the two cities were flat or positive

<HD>Rally of Last 2 Weeks Continues</HD>
<DH>Investors shrug off news about soft economic activity. Dow
gains 215 points, and Nasdaq rises 21. Treasury yields soar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks climbed Monday after an early drop, driving key indexes higher
for the seventh time in the last eight sessions as Wall Street's
dramatic turnaround of the last two weeks continued.</LD>
<LD>   Despite soft economic data, investors are showing newfound
"euphoria," money manager Brian Bruce of PanAgora Asset Management in
Boston told the Associated Press. "People have been waiting for
something to be enthusiastic about. [Monday] is an example of people
wanting to see the glass half full."</LD>
<LD>   The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average rallied 215.84 points,
or 2.6%, to 8,538.24, bringing its gain to more than 17% since it hit
a five-year low Oct. 9.</LD>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index jumped 15.33 points, or
1.7%, to 899.72, and the tech-loaded Nasdaq composite climbed 21.81
points, or 1.7%, to 1,309.67.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New
York Stock Exchange amid moderate volume.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury yields soared as investors continued to shift money out
of fixed-income securities and focused on equities.</TE>
<TE>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rocketed to
4.25%, from 4.11% on Friday. The 10-year T-note yield fell to a
generational low of 3.57% on Oct. 9.</TE>
<TE>   The recent stock rally has pushed major market gauges to their
highest closes since Sept. 11. The three major market gauges wrapped
up two straight weeks of gains Friday on the heels of six successive
down weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptical analysts said it remains to be seen whether this move is
another sharp rally within the bear market of the last 2 1/2 years or
whether stocks might have reached lasting lows earlier this month.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen a bottom that the market is probably going to test a
little bit," strategist Laszlo Birinyi of Deutsche Bank told
Bloomberg News. "I don't think it's up, up and away."</TE>
<TE>   The market slumped early in the day after an indicator of U.S.
economic activity fell in September for the fourth month in a row.
The Conference Board said the index of leading economic indicators
fell 0.2% last month.</TE>
<TE>   Cautious comments from software giant Microsoft also tempered
investor enthusiasm and limited gains in the tech sector. Microsoft
eased 64 cents to $52.51 after a top executive said a surge in fiscal
first-quarter sales was not sustainable and forecast tough business
conditions ahead.</TE>
<TE>   So far, 61% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 have beaten earnings
forecasts for the last quarter -- although many previously had guided
analysts downward, and many have issued cautious guidance going
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Investors still shrugged off the economic news and other concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said investor sentiment perked up as worry about a
U.S. war with Iraq eased. Oil prices plunged on signs the U.S. was
ready to compromise on a United Nations resolution on Iraq, cooling
fears of an imminent strike on Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris and Coca-Cola helped lead the advance after Wall
Street analysts recommended their shares. Philip Morris gained $2.45
to $42.49 after Salomon Smith Barney said the company may introduce a
discount brand of cigarettes to fend off low-price competition. Coke
climbed $1.61 to $48 after Thomas Weisel Partners upgraded the
shares.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Major drug shares declined after President Bush proposed
regulations aimed at bringing lower-cost generic drugs to market
faster. Pfizer slid $1.34 to $32.15 and Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped
44 cents to $23.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Manufacturer 3M rose $3.69 to $129 after reporting quarterly
earnings surged 38%, driven by cost cutting and strong sales in Asia.
The company also warned that the global economy still looks sluggish.</TE>
<TE>   * Johnson &amp; Johnson climbed $1.76 to $61.11 after an arbitrator
rejected a bid by Amgen to bar Johnson &amp; Johnson from selling its
Procrit anemia drug in the U.S. Amgen slipped 10 cents to $50.38.</TE>
<TE>   * Advanced Micro Devices surged $1.15 to $5.55 after Barron's said
sales of a new server chip scheduled to ship next year may allow the
share price to quadruple. Intel, the biggest maker of computer
microprocessors, added 99 cents to $15.45.</TE>
<TE>   * Allegheny Energy jumped $1.30 to $6.20, leading a surge in
energy shares, after the utility owner won Securities and Exchange
Commission approval to seek $2 billion in secured loans.</TE>
<TE>   * SureBeam gained 34 cents to $3.85 after the San Diego-based
maker of irradiation technology said the government approved such
treatment for imported fruits and vegetables.</TE>

<HD>McKesson Profit Climbs 58% on Higher Drug, Service Sales</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>McKesson Corp.'s quarterly profit climbed 58% as the No. 3 U.S. drug
wholesaler sold more medicines, health-care supplies and services.</LD>
<LD>   Net income for the fiscal second quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to
$124.8 million, or 42 cents a share, from $79 million, or 27 cents, a
year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue excluding shipments to customers' warehouses, a benchmark
for drug wholesalers, rose 15% to $10.3 billion from $8.91 billion,
McKesson said in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   Pharmaceutical sales rose 17% to $9.32 billion as McKesson sold
more generic medicines, which have higher profit margins. Revenue
from computer services and software rose 16% to $275.5 million,
continuing the revival of a business McKesson bought for $13.9
billion in 1999 that cost the company billions in market value when
sales turned out to be inflated.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm impressed with the computer services" results, said Ralph
Shive, who holds 25,000 McKesson shares in his 1st Source Monogram
Income Equity Fund. "That had been a huge drain for them, and it's as
good news as any in this quarter."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of medical and surgical supplies were unchanged at $684.2
million. The company in June had said revenue in that business would
be little changed in fiscal 2003 as the unit is reorganized.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Francisco-based McKesson rose 73 cents to $29.24 in
New York Stock Exchange trading. The company reported results after
U.S. markets closed.</TE>
<TE>   McKesson trails AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc.
in pharmaceutical-distribution sales.</TE>

<HD>Judge Approves Loan From Anonymous Bidder to Napster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Delaware bankruptcy judge Monday took the unusual step of approving
a $200,000 loan from an anonymous suitor of Napster Inc. to keep the
company alive until a sale of its assets is completed, probably
within a month.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh authorized the financing at the
request of a court-appointed trustee and a committee of unsecured
creditors owed money by the silenced song-swapping service.</LD>
<LD>   The suitor emerged a week ago as negotiations with an earlier
anonymous bidder dragged on, according to filings in the Delaware
case.</LD>
<TE>   Creditors' attorney Rick Antonoff said he believes that a final
agreement to sell Napster's assets to the new bidder could be reached
in two weeks, when the buyer will be identified. "We hope to close
within 30 days," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Preliminary terms call for the bidder to pay $5 million in cash
and an undisclosed amount of other consideration to Napster's
creditors in exchange for some of the Redwood City, Calif.-based
company's assets. The rest of Napster will be sold elsewhere,
Antonoff said.</TE>
<TE>   Napster filed for bankruptcy reorganization in June, reeling from
unfavorable rulings in a copyright case brought by record labels and
music publishers. Bertelsmann had planned to buy Napster's technology
through the Bankruptcy Court, but Walsh blocked that deal last month
because Napster didn't show that its dealings with the German media
company were at arm's length.</TE>
<TE>   Napster was facing Chapter 7 liquidation until the last-minute
bidders emerged.</TE>

<HD>Test Copies of New Office Released</HD>
<DH>Beta version of the Microsoft software contains a major
shift toward the open language called XML.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Joseph Menn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. has released test copies of the new version of its
lucrative Office software suite, showcasing significant improvements
that the company hopes will spur sales of related programs running on
central computer servers.</LD>
<LD>   Although Office 11 isn't expected to ship to customers until the
middle of next year, the beta copies include a major shift toward the
open language called XML, or extensible markup language.</LD>
<LD>   Spreadsheets and documents created using Office's Excel or Word
programs can be saved in the XML format. Once stored in XML,
documents can be programmed to update themselves by retrieving new
pieces of information stored on company servers or out on the
Internet.</LD>
<TE>   The result is a far more communicative set of programs that can be
adapted by company information technology managers to make common
tasks easier, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "You basically transform the value from being a stand-alone
desktop to something that's a lot more connected to the enterprise,"
said software analyst Ted Schadler of Forrester Research. "Suddenly
Office documents can become reusable."</TE>
<TE>   The changes also carry some risk for Microsoft, which earns more
money from Office than from its monopoly Windows operating systems.</TE>
<TE>   Because many programs recognize XML, data created in Office don't
need to stay there. Other programs, even those running on rival
operating systems, can interact with Windows PCs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great benefit that [XML] is so widespread," said Office
Product Manager Simon Marks. "If it makes sense for them to have a
different application, that's great."</TE>
<TE>   Office sells from $150 to $450, depending on the version, whether
users are upgrading and whether they are students or professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Although Microsoft's Office programs are standard issue in many
business settings, they are getting some challenge from
less-expensive rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The free corroborative product OpenOffice and Sun Microsystems
Inc.'s StarOffice can do similar tasks, and Corel Corp.'s WordPerfect
word-processing program is being installed on some PCs made by
Gateway Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Dell Computer Corp. and Sony Corp.</TE>

<HD>Oil Prices Dive on Easing of Iraq War Fears</HD>
<DH>Despite a recent pump price drop in California, some
analysts say gas is primed to rise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Market prices for crude oil and gasoline tumbled Monday as fears of a
U.S. war with Iraq abated, but the price drop won't necessarily open
the door to further declines in California pump prices, analysts
said.</LD>
<LD>   After climbing back above $30 a barrel last week, crude oil prices
abruptly turned south after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
appeared to soften the U.S. position toward Iraq. He said the United
States might not try to oust Saddam Hussein if the Iraqi leader
abandons weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<LD>   His remarks eased concerns of a disruption in imports of Middle
East oil, and crude for current delivery fell $1.23, or 4.2%, to
$28.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the
sharpest one-day decline since July 22.</LD>
<TE>   Crude oil prices have jumped more than 40% this year because of
the Iraqi war fears, recent terrorist bombings in Bali and Yemen, and
tropical storms along the Gulf of Mexico that hobbled production
there.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the turmoil, gasoline prices have dropped recently in
California and remained stable nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, the average price of self-serve regular as of
Monday had fallen to $1.541 a gallon from $1.617 a month ago, the
American Automobile Assn. reported. In Orange County, the price has
dropped to $1.555 a gallon from $1.631 a month ago. At some Southland
service stations, the price of regular has dipped below $1.40 a
gallon.</TE>
<TE>   California heavily relies on crude oil pumped from Alaska, and
supplies have been sufficient until now to meet the demands of
motorists in recent weeks without sending prices spiraling higher in
tandem with market prices for crude, said David Pursell, a vice
president at Simmons &amp; Co., an energy investment banking firm in
Houston. Demand also has slackened recently because the busy summer
travel season is over.</TE>
<TE>   But while motorists might get a bit more relief from Monday's
sharp decline in crude prices, the volatile oil market could just as
quickly move back up, he said. "Odds are it's a one-day event" and
the price of crude "is not going down to $20 [a barrel] on the news"
of Powell's remarks, Pursell added.</TE>
<TE>   And California oil executive Bob van der Valk, who has been
predicting higher pump prices for California, said Monday's drop in
crude oil prices did nothing to change his mind. Recent cuts in
retail prices are "coming to a screeching halt," said Van der Valk,
bulk fuels manager at Cosby Oil Co., an independent fuel distributor
based in Santa Fe Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline supplies in the state are starting to tighten as
producers respond to the seasonally slow travel period with less
production, which should nudge prices higher, he said. It's a
situation that cannot be easily offset by importing fuel from other
states, because few refineries outside California can produce the
state's cleaner-burning gasoline that's mandated by air-pollution
rules.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, several major refiners are preparing to switch to a
new clean-air additive, ethanol, on Jan. 1, and that transfer will at
least temporarily shrink overall gasoline supplies, Van der Valk
predicted. The refiners are moving to ethanol in place of methyl
tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, a low-emissions additive that is being
banned by Gov. Gray Davis because studies showed it had leaked into
underground water supplies.</TE>
<TE>   National market prices for gasoline and other refined products
followed crude oil's decline Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Gasoline for November delivery skidded 4.14 cents, or 4.9%, to
81.03 cents a gallon on the mercantile exchange. That represents the
wholesale price on trading markets, before taxes and dealer markups.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. saw its third-quarter
earnings fall 9.5% as natural gas prices in California relaxed from
the energy-crisis induced spikes experienced last year.</LD>
<LD>   The oil and natural gas producer and chemical maker said
third-quarter net income fell to $402 million, or $1.07 per share,
from $444 million, or $1.19, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Earnings had dropped in the year's first two quarters and
continued the slide this period.</LD>
<TE>   "The decline in domestic natural-gas prices in the third quarter
of 2002, due to the absence of the unusual California gas market
experienced last year, reduced earnings," the company said in a
statement.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue dipped 1% to $1.96 billion, down from $1.98 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter profit from energy production fell 8.5% to $483
million, compared with a year ago, Occidental said.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting for the difference was California, where higher prices
lingered last year after an energy crisis that led to blackouts in
some parts of the state, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Natural gas is used to fuel many California power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Although net income took another dip, several analysts said Wall
Street was more focused on earnings before special items and
discontinued operations, which were $329 million (or 87 cents per
share), compared with $316 million (or 85 cents per share) for the
third quarter of 2001, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   That beat the consensus of 76 cents per share, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental shares rose 13 cents to close at $30.58 on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   And though oil and gas earnings dipped, profit from the firm's
chemical segment was up nearly 130% compared with last year, said
Michael Young, senior oil analyst with Gerard, Klauer Mattison.</TE>
<TE>   "While oil and gas profits declined modestly on lower U.S. natural
gas prices, chemical profits were up sharply year over year," Young
said, calling it a "strong quarter" for the firm.</TE>

<HD>Port Delays May Deny World Series' Fans Free 'Memorable
Moments'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Cleeland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wednesday is camera night at the World Series. There's just one
problem: The 57,000 disposable cameras meant to be handed to fans at
Game 4 in San Francisco, with "World Series 2002" stamped into every
frame, are stuck on a container ship outside the Port of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Unless Mitch Tendler comes up with an angel of his own, he said it
means a loss of nearly $250,000 to his Chatsworth-based company,
Greeting Camera.</LD>
<LD>   After a month of slowdowns and lockouts, ports along the entire
West Coast are jammed with backlogged vessels -- more than 100
outside the Los Angeles-Long Beach complex alone.</LD>
<TE>   Each ship holds thousands of containers, and every container has
some sort of story to tell. But it's hard to imagine one that
measures up to Tendler's in pure frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "I know where they are," he said. "They're in a container at the
top level of a ship called the Mercator. It arrived on the 15th, but
things are moving so slow they tell us they won't have it unloaded
until the first of November."</TE>
<TE>   Which, obviously, is almost two weeks too late.</TE>
<TE>   Tendler has tried calling in old favors, begging and offering free
tickets to the series in hopes of getting the container off the NYK
Line ship. "We've even looked at getting someone to go out there and
pull it out, but there's no way."</TE>
<TE>   Tendler, who sells promotional cameras to clients from theme parks
to drug firms, won the World Series deal from Pro Specialties Group
of San Diego, which has an agreement with Major League Baseball to
distribute the cameras. The order was too large to fill from his Los
Angeles factory, so he sent a rush order to a partner in Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, contract negotiations between the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn.,
representing cargo carriers, were tense but civil. "Everybody told us
[a labor disruption] would be a short thing. If it happened, the
president would intervene. We figured we'd have a 10-day cushion. We
thought that would be enough."</TE>
<TE>   The camera giveaway is tied to a season-long campaign sponsored by
MasterCard for fans to choose baseball's greatest moment. Each photo
taken with the cameras will bear the credit card company's logo,
along with the phrase "Memorable Moments, World Series 2002."</TE>
<TE>   Tendler hopes MasterCard might be willing to distribute the
cameras later, giving the merchandise to fans in exchange for ticket
stubs. MasterCard executives could not be reached for comment late
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The longshore union and the Pacific Maritime Assn. have been at
odds over the introduction of labor-saving technology. Federal
mediator Peter J. Hurtgen toured the ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach on Monday and is scheduled to resume talks with both sides
Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Regal Profit Rises on Acquisitions</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regal Entertainment Group, the largest U.S. movie theater chain, saw
its third-quarter profit rise almost sixfold, primarily from
acquisitions.</LD>
<LD>   Net income in the latest quarter rose to $36.1 million from $6.1
million a year ago. Per-share earnings declined to 27 cents a share
from 32 cents a year earlier as the number of shares outstanding
increased to 136.2 million from about 19 million.</LD>
<LD>   Sales for the Sept. 26 quarter more than tripled to $571.5 million
from $158.7 million a year earlier, the Knoxville, Tenn.-based
company said.</LD>
<TE>   Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz created Regal Entertainment
by merging Regal Cinemas Corp., United Artists Theatre Co. and
Edwards Theatres Inc., all of which he acquired through bankruptcy
reorganizations.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter sales and profit include the results of all three
chains, while the year-earlier figures reflect only the operations of
United Artists.</TE>
<TE>   "Third-quarter results demonstrate how a growth strategy of
prudent consolidation works well even in periods of minimal
box-office growth," Co-Chief Executive Mike Campbell said in a
conference call. Regal also declared a 15-cent dividend, payable Dec.
13 to shareholders as of Nov. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Regal rose 63 cents, or 3%, to close at $21 on the New
York Stock Exchange. They have risen 11% since the company's
$342-million initial public offering in May.</TE>
<TE>   Regal also announced Monday that National Broadcasting Co. would
develop original short videos to play before movies, using a digital
network that Regal is rolling out to many of its theaters. As part of
the multi-year deal, National Broadcasting also will run ads on
screens in theater lobbies, convenience stores and restaurants
connected to Regal's digital network. Financial terms of the deal
were not released.</TE>
<TE>   Regal plans to deploy the network and digital projectors in about
400 of its 530 theaters by the end of 2003.</TE>

<LD>Following the lead of major league baseball and the National
Basketball Assn., the National Hockey League is starting to charge
fans for online video.</LD>
<LD>   The NHL announced a new service offering video highlights of
goals, saves and other action for $4.95 a month, as well as "classic"
games on demand for $1.95 to $2.95 per viewing.</LD>
<LD>   The league, which still will offer some complete games and
highlights for free through Microsoft Corp.'s MSN Sports Web site,
uses Microsoft's Windows Media format for online video.</LD>
<TE>   Major league baseball and the NBA, in contrast, use technology
from RealNetworks Inc. for their subscription video services.</TE>

<LD>* Sony Corp.'s television unit confidentially settled a lawsuit
brought by the unit's former president over his compensation,
averting a jury trial. Jon Feltheimer, who resigned from Sony's
Columbia TriStar Television Group in September 1999, was at Sony for
eight years and lead the unit when it developed hits "Mad About You,"
"Party of Five" and "Dawson's Creek" for the networks. He sued for
$10 million last year, claiming that the company reneged on his
compensation agreement when he left. Feltheimer is now chief
executive of Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>United States Steel Corp. posted a better-than-expected quarterly
profit, reversing a year-earlier loss, helped by federal tariffs on
imports and strong demand from the auto industry.</LD>
<LD>   Domestic steel prices soared this year, in part because President
Bush imposed tariffs on a range of imports in an effort to prop up
the ailing industry.</LD>
<LD>   Prices also got a lift from a falloff in U.S. capacity after a
string of industry bankruptcies, partly due to the burdens of retiree
health-care and pension costs.</LD>
<TE>   The company, based in Pittsburgh, reported earnings of $106
million, or $1.04 a share, including special items, contrasted with a
loss of $23 million, or 26 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to
$1.91 billion.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Steel shares rose 1 cent to close at $12.84 on the New York
Stock Exchange after Monday's earnings release, which showed the
benefit of a nearly 60% increase in steel prices from a year before.</TE>

follow new guidelines for reporting certain operating figures, a move
designed to give investors better information for evaluating the
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The guidelines won't replace generally accepted accounting

they are seeking to eliminate inconsistencies in how their companies

<HD>THQ Posts Double-Digit Gains Amid Robust Video Game Sales</HD>
<DH>Despite third-quarter growth, the Calabasas firm revises
outlook for 2003 as retailers report weak console sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With unprecedented numbers of American homes equipped with video game
consoles, game publisher THQ Inc. posted double-digit increases in
profit and sales but surprised investors by throttling back guidance
for its growth in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The Calabasas-based publisher of such games as "Red Faction" and
"SpongeBob SquarePants" reported $4.8 million in net income, or 12
cents a share, in its third quarter on sales of $97.3 million. That's
up from $3.2 million in profit, or 9 cents a share, on $68 million in
sales in the same period last year. The earnings met expectations of
Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.</LD>
<LD>   Even so, shares of THQ, which released results after the stock
market closed, lost nearly 30% of their value to $16.25 in
after-hours sessions after gaining $1.70 to $23.17 on Nasdaq in
regular trading.</LD>
<TE>   THQ Chief Executive Brian Farrell cut his outlook for the
industry's growth to 10% to 15%, down from previous estimates of 20%
to 25%. He also projected that THQ's revenue would grow just 9% in
2003 to $585 million, while profit would remain flat at $1.40 a
share.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell said the revision resulted from feedback THQ received from
retailers that reported that although Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2
consoles are selling well, Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox and Nintendo Co.'s
GameCube are struggling.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of weaker growth, Farrell said he expects THQ to maintain
or increase market share next year. THQ is the fourth-largest
independent game publisher, with 6.2% of the market.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's weakness, it's a market weakness," Farrell said. "The
three platforms just aren't driving the market to the extent
retailers anticipated."</TE>

<HD>Barbie Is Queen of Toy List</HD>
<DH>Retailers expect the Rapunzel version to rule this holiday
season, survey says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc.'s Rapunzel Barbie doll is expected to be the bestselling
toy this holiday season as girls nationwide return to choosing dolls
as a plaything of choice.</LD>
<LD>   The prediction is based on a survey of retailers to be released
today by PlayDate Inc., a New York marketing services firm. Retailers
say the doll, which is already on store shelves, is popular for her
long hair and starring role in an animated video version of the
classic "Rapunzel" fairy tale.</LD>
<LD>   This year's PlayDate survey lists four dolls among the top 10
products, double last year's number.</LD>
<TE>   That makes sense given the doll category's overall resurgence over
the last 12 months, said Reyne Rice, the director of marketing and
communications for NPDFunworld, the toy arm of market researcher NPD
Group Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The bestselling category for 2001, dolls accounted for about $3
billion in sales between June 2001 and June of this year, Rice said,
or nearly 14% of all toy sales.</TE>
<TE>   The category had waned over the years as older girls increasingly
turned away from the playthings many of them saw as "babyish," Rice
said.</TE>
<TE>   But because of lines such as Bratz, made by San Fernando
Valley-based MGA Entertainment Inc., 9- to 12-year-olds are coming
back for what are known as "attitude" dolls, which feature off-beat
looks, cool street fashion and names and sayings more like those of
today's teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of traditional toys, which don't include the red-hot video
game category, are expected to be flat, NPD said Monday. The closure
of West Coast ports also has weighed heavily on the toy industry,
with companies worried that key products will not make it through the
backlog in time.</TE>
<TE>   But a spokeswoman for El Segundo-based Mattel said that because
the company took early delivery of key toys, Rapunzel Barbie and
other products on this year's list are unlikely to be affected by the
disruption.</TE>
<TE>   This year's top 10 list from retailers includes Playmates Toys
Inc.'s Disney Toddler Princesses and Mattel's Fisher-Price division's
Dora the Explorer dolls, a line based on Nickelodeon's TV show about
the adventures of a young Latina.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, retailers surveyed by PlayDate predicted that Lego's
Bionicle figures would be the season's top-selling toy. Although the
toy did well, NPD data showed LeapFrog Inc.'s LeapPad electronic
learning toy was the bestseller.</TE>

<HD>UAL to Cut 1,250 Jobs, Close Centers</HD>
<DH>Airline, which seeks to avoid bankruptcy, will trim costs
in an effort to save $100 million a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines parent UAL Corp., the world's second-biggest airline,
said it will lay off 1,250 workers as part of a plan to save $100
million a year and shrink the carrier to fit lower demand.</LD>
<LD>   The company will close reservation centers in San Francisco, Long
Beach and Indianapolis in January, resulting in 686 layoffs. It also
will close a maintenance line in Indianapolis that services Boeing
757s.</LD>
<LD>   The airline said it will soon announce "additional adjustments" to
its schedule and staffing levels.</LD>
<TE>   United is the largest airline operating out of Los Angeles and San
Francisco international airports. It has more than 1,900 flights
worldwide a day and about 84,000 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, UAL, which is restructuring in an effort to stay out of
bankruptcy, announced an $889-million third-quarter loss and said its
operations have been losing about $7 million a day.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came as United prepares to file an updated
business plan with the federal government this week, hoping to
strengthen its application for further financial assistance by
detailing cost cuts and the results of weeks of concession talks with
unions and lenders.</TE>
<TE>   United is seeking a $1.8-billion loan guarantee from the Air
Transportation Stabilization Board to meet impending debt payments
and help it return to profitability.</TE>
<TE>   "These actions are unfortunately necessary given the current weak
revenue environment," said Glenn Tilton, the carrier's chairman,
president and chief executive. "Like other airlines, we need to make
sure that we correctly match supply with demand."</TE>
<TE>   Tilton made clear he is still counting on unions to agree to
substantially more cutbacks at the airline, which is 55% owned by its
employees.</TE>
<TE>   United and the leaders of its five unions have agreed in principle
on the need for $5.8 billion in labor concessions over 5 1/2 years.
But implementation of such an agreement hinges on separate deals
being reached with each union.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of UAL Corp. closed 22 cents higher Monday at $1.93 on the
New York Stock Exchange before the company's announcement.</TE>

<HD>Study Finds Shortfall for Asian Businesswomen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the last four years, Asian female business owners were more
likely than other nonwhite female entrepreneurs to have less access
to credit and to start firms with smaller grubstakes, according to a
study being released today.</LD>
<LD>   Women's business advocates speculated that the change was due at
least in part to the economy, as lenders tightened purse strings and
Asian business owners in segments hard hit by the downturn grew wary
of accumulating more debt.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly half of the Asian female business owners polled said they
launched their firms with $25,000 or less, according to the study by
the Center for Women's Business Research. At the same time, only
about 11% of Asian female entrepreneurs had $100,000 or more to start
their businesses. The Washington-based center conducted a similar
study in 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "If we look at the '90s, that was a period of such tremendous
growth in terms of business spending," said Sharon Hadary, executive
director of the center. "By 2000, the bottom had fallen out."</TE>
<TE>   In the study, which was funded by Wells Fargo &amp; Co., researchers
polled more than 800 female business owners nationwide across
ethnicities in April and May.</TE>
<TE>   In many categories, the study results showed no statistically
significant change over the years. Yet some of the largest changes
disproportionately affected Asian female business owners.</TE>
<TE>   For example, while fewer Asian women said they had $100,000 or
more in business credit to launch their enterprises, the number of
African American female business owners with at least that much
credit more than doubled--to 13% of entrepreneurs this year from 6%
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for businesswomen were at a loss to fully explain the
differences.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Borden, executive director of Long Beach-based Women's
Enterprise Development Corp., a nonprofit group, noted that many
Asian-owned firms are concentrated in sectors hard hit by the
downturn, including tourism and travel. That might make business
owners more wary about accessing larger amounts of credit, he said.</TE>

<HD>J.P. Morgan Shares Up on Takeover Talk</HD>
<DH>Stock rises $1.30 to $20.27 on rumors that Bank One will
buy the No. 2 U.S. bank, but analysts are skeptical.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s stock surged Monday on speculation that
Bank One Corp. would buy the bank, which is struggling in a weak
market. But analysts doubted the deal would happen.</LD>
<LD>   "There is this takeover rumor on the stock," analyst Reilly
Tierney of Fox-Pitt, Kelton said. "I think it's improbable....
Whoever buys J.P. Morgan is going to have to have a lot of capital to
recapitalize [the firm], to address the balance-sheet issues that
clearly hang over the stock."</LD>
<LD>   J.P. Morgan shares rose $1.30 to $20.27, and Bank One's shares
were up 20 cents to close at $39.08, both in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</LD>
<TE>   A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman declined to comment. A Bank One
spokeswoman said it was against the bank's policy to comment on
rumors.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago-based Bank One is smaller than J.P. Morgan, which is the
No. 2 U.S. banking company by assets, but its market capitalization
is larger, at about $45 billion. J.P. Morgan Chase's market
capitalization is about $40 billion, after concerns about unpaid
corporate loans and its involvement with collapsed energy trader
Enron Corp. drove its stock down more than 40% this year. (Market cap
is figured by multiplying a company's stock price by the number of
its outstanding shares.)</TE>
<TE>   Bank One Chief Executive James Dimon has expressed an interest in
expanding credit card, money management, retail and possibly
investment banking units. But analysts said J.P. Morgan Chase's loans
would be too risky for Bank One, which has been reducing its
corporate lending.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan is wrestling with weak stock trading results and
losses on soured loans to telecommunications and cable companies. Its
third-quarter profit fell 91% to $40 million, or a penny a share, and
it said it would cut about 2,200 additional jobs following previous
staff reductions.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever a company is as challenged as J.P. Morgan is right now
with respect to its financial performance, that's when stories like
this surface," said Brock Vandervliet, an analyst at Lehman Bros. "So
from that perspective, it's not surprising."</TE>
<TE>   Bank One has fared better in the slow economy and stock market
slump. It posted a 9% rise in third-quarter profit to $823 million,
or 70 cents a share, helped by higher balances in its vast credit
card business, deposit growth and cost controls.</TE>

<HD>White House Denies Stinting on SEC Funding</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The White House defended on Monday its request for Congress to give
the Securities and Exchange Commission $200 million less than was
demanded by a new law to fight corporate fraud.</LD>
<LD>   Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates assailed the Bush
budget request as an attempt to undercut the corporate crackdown law
enacted this summer in response to a wave of accounting scandals.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush signed the law with much fanfare and a promise that
his administration would go after corporate crooks as aggressively as
it has hunted terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   The law created new penalties, including stiff prison terms, for
corporate fraud and document shredding, established an independent
board to oversee the accounting industry and authorized $776 million
for the SEC, representing a 77% jump in its budget.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the White House increased its initial $467 million SEC
request for the fiscal year that started Oct. 1 by $100 million,
making its total proposal $567 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We proposed the largest increase in the SEC's budget of modern
times, and that was part of a fiscally responsible budget that has
been submitted to the Congress," presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer
said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "The budget that is proposed is the budget that the SEC asked
for," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Congress' final decision on a funding level for the SEC is hung up
in the raft of spending bills that lawmakers failed to pass before
adjourning to campaign for midterm elections. A Senate version of the
legislation would provide $751 million for the SEC; the House hasn't
written its bill yet.</TE>
<TE>   "By failing to fully fund the SEC, the Bush White House is
essentially saying, 'We don't want an effective securities cop on the
beat protecting investors from fraud,' " said Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D-Mass.), a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee.</TE>

<LD>Health Net -- A story in the California section Saturday on the
closure of San Luis Obispo County's General Hospital incorrectly
implied that Health Net no longer will provide health insurance in
the county. A Health Net spokesman said the company is no longer
providing health maintenance organization coverage there, but is
still offering plans to employers for paid provider organizations and
exclusive provider organizations. Health Net has dropped HMO coverage
because of the high cost of doing business in the county, not because
of the company's finances, the spokesman said.</LD>

<LD>Federal officials have long required doctors to report cases of many
kinds of infectious diseases. However, the government has never
required similar tracking of patients afflicted by chronic diseases
such as asthma and autism -- lifelong disorders thought to be caused
by a dance between people's genes and their exposure to particular
substances in their diet or environment.</LD>
<LD>   Washington's neglect of chronic-disease monitoring may have been a
tragic mistake. A study released by UC Davis researchers last week
showed a dramatic tripling of autism rates in California in the last
decade and a half. The increase cannot be explained away merely by
statistical glitches. For example, the researchers have ruled out the
possibility that today's doctors are diagnosing anomalies that their
predecessors missed.</LD>
<LD>   The new study of autism -- a severe brain disorder that often
leaves its victims unable to speak or form long-term social
relationships -- should prompt Congress to develop an effective and
comprehensive way to track the outbreak of chronic diseases.</LD>
<TE>   The good news is that California legislators have been ahead
nationally in recognizing the danger that chronic diseases present.
They, in fact, commissioned the UC Davis report. But California's
initiative does little to help people in other states, most of which
have no chronic-disease monitoring systems.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, even California's autism reporting system is flawed. It
does not, for example, require doctors in all state agencies, from
the Department of Education to the Department of Developmental
Disabilities, to use a uniform standard for diagnosing autism.</TE>
<TE>   Creating a national chronic-disease database won't be easy.
Epidemiologists will have to be careful to protect patients' privacy
by using record-keeping safeguards, like computer encryption. And
consumer privacy groups that have reflexively opposed any new
reporting systems should accept that improved disease-rate monitoring
will require patients to give scientists some limited access to their
medical records.</TE>
<TE>   What's clear is that continued indifference will be deadly.
Political leaders have to give epidemiologists the money and moral
support they need to overturn all the rocks in their search for
answers to rising autism rates.</TE>

<LD>Now that you've waded through the serious issue stuff above, here's
something that affects your life intimately: T-shirt labels. Those
seriously annoying little fabric doodads sewn into the back of
T-shirts to cause stubborn, irritating itches right where you can't
reach them are now history, at least in Hanes T-shirts. About time.</LD>
<LD>   The company made the historic announcement recently in nationwide
promotions designed to spur comfort and maybe, who knows, sales in a
stagnant T-shirt market. Even Michael Jordan will go tagless. So you
know how important this wardrobe development is.</LD>
<LD>   Besides covering the body, T-shirts have become an important 1st
Amendment issue, proclaiming a wearer's affiliation, beliefs or even
ignorance.</LD>
<TE>   But according to Hanes, two-thirds of all men were hot under the
collar; they didn't like prickly labels that felt like hairs from a
new haircut. Hanes says half of all male T-shirt wearers took a stand
for independence, eventually ripping out the label themselves.
Imagine the courage! Some normally law-abiding moms also admitted
cutting T-shirt tags from the clothing of whining youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Though removing a T-shirt label is not as defiant as, say, ripping
a consumer warning tag from a new mattress, it could violate a law
requiring that labels be visible to consumers. Envision the
legislative arguments over what information must be on these
inaccessible tags in minuscule print on the back of most necks. Not
your Lincoln-Douglass debates. But relax, Hanes now heat-prints the
same information in the same place.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair in this emotional debate, there are downsides to
tagless T-shirts. Spouses and parents will no longer be able to
display silent affection by tucking a bent tag back inside the shirt
of a family member. Removing all T-shirt tags also maliciously
increases the early-morning challenge of discerning which is the
front and the back of undershirts.</TE>
<TE>   And because each label covers 1 square inch of fabric and Hanes
annually sells about 36% of this country's 300 million T-shirts, that
means some 108 million square inches of labels will not be made each
year.</TE>
<TE>   Someone will find a depressed village devastated by the removal of
its vital local industry, weaving useless polyester tags to annoy
Americans far away. So be it. This is the kind of progress America
needs to lift its spirits on an autumn Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>Civil authorities and victims of child abuse in the United States
should have zero tolerance for the Vatican's latest reluctance to
take the crisis in the Catholic Church seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Before news of Catholic priests sexually abusing children became
public, the church hierarchy showed little respect for the children
whom priests had abused. Church officials simply moved a priest
accused of sexual abuse in one parish to another. Often, no one
bothered to notify civil authorities that a child had claimed he or
she was molested. It's called sweeping the dirt under the rug, and in
the long run it always makes things worse.</LD>
<LD>   When accusations against priests became epidemic, the Catholic
hierarchy finally decided to do something. Some archdioceses in the
U.S. agreed to cooperate with civil authorities by notifying them of
alleged abuses.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, in June, the U.S. bishops met in Dallas and decided that
as a matter of policy, the church had to make protecting innocent
victims its first concern.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops, admitting they had been at fault, called for
laypeople to watch over the review of abuse cases. Grasping that the
church in the U.S. was reeling under the scandal, the bishops called
for zero tolerance in dealing with sexual abuse. Under that policy, a
priest, deacon or any other church employee facing a credible
allegation of sexual abuse would be temporarily removed and all
accusations reported to civil authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, the Vatican hesitated at the zero-tolerance policy
adopted in Dallas and balked at opening the church to scrutiny by
laypeople. It plans a joint commission of the Vatican and U.S.
bishops to work out changes to make American archdioceses' sex-abuse
policy conform with canon law.</TE>
<TE>   Without the Vatican's approval, the U.S. bishops' policy is not
binding. Worse, the Vatican's response gives bishops who were
initially reluctant to implement the tough, victim-oriented policy
the perfect excuse to further delay it.</TE>
<TE>   While the Vatican dawdles, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has promised
that his archdiocese, which includes Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties, will continue to enforce the zero-tolerance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Other U.S. bishops vow to stay the course set in Dallas,
understanding, perhaps, what the Vatican doesn't: that the need to
address child molestation is urgent, and any alleged abuser, whether
a priest or a bricklayer, is accountable not just to the church but
to the police and the criminal courts.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ballot Recommendations," editorial, Oct. 20: The remarkable 100%
turnout and 100% vote for Saddam Hussein in Iraq last week and a
count of paper ballots in 12 hours seems highly unlikely for a
supposed democratic election. The 100% Democratic Party
recommendations for all eight state officeholders and the 100%
retention of the 19 state judicial incumbents, as found in The Times,
also seems like an unlikely set of recommendations for a supposedly
objective newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   That all current officeholders are the best available individuals
for all state offices and courts is, at best, remarkable. I don't
care to think about the worst possibilities.</LD>

<TE>   My decision on whom to vote for as the next governor of California
was still undecided. However, Gov. Gray Davis showing how gutless he
really is in not releasing Jerilyn Becker ("Davis Denies Parole for
Model Inmate Jailed 22 Years in Killing," Oct. 19) has, in effect,
etched my vote in stone for Bill Simon.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Ex-Enron Trader Admits Rigging Energy Market," Oct. 18: Isn't
it about time everyone got off of Davis' back and got into his
corner? The governor stood up to these admitted criminals and was
attacked from all sides for losing the battle. But it looks like he
is going to win the war -- and the winner is going to be the
California taxpayer, who had to fund the criminals' illegal practices
in the first place. "Vice President Dick Cheney suggested California
was to blame" tells me it's time to send a message to the Bush
administration: Vote the governor back into office in a landslide. He
fought for us and he was right.</TE>

<HD>Ryder Prosecution Isn't a Showcase for the D.A.</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the director in the district attorney's office with oversight over
the Winona Ryder case, I am shocked and dismayed at "Ryder
Shoplifting Case Steals the Scene" by Joel Mowbray (Commentary, Oct.
7). The district attorney's office has sought neither publicity nor
special treatment, inside or outside the courtroom, in the
prosecution of the Ryder case. Any suggestion of "celebrity justice"
should be refocused on those who seek the publicity and not on the
prosecutorial agency that evaluates cases in an evenhanded manner
regardless of a defendant's standing in the community.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. County district attorney's office tries cases in the
courtroom, not in the press. The defendant was held to answer after
the preliminary hearing, when the judge found that there was
sufficient evidence to hold the defendant to answer for the crimes
charged. Mowbray chose to ignore the evidence presented in court and
to suggest that the facts are other than those presented. The
prosecution of this case has everything to do with justice and
nothing to do with politics.</LD>

<LD>"U.N. Resolutions Frequently Violated" (Oct. 17) omits two facts that
are indispensable to understanding the baseless comparison of Iraq
and Israel regarding the implementation of Security Council
resolutions. While the article mentions the difference between
compulsory Chapter 7 resolutions and nonbinding Chapter 6
resolutions, it neglects to point out that all but two Iraq
resolutions came under Chapter 7 and are legally binding. Every
Security Council resolution related to Israel was passed under
Chapter 6 and thus advisory.</LD>
<LD>   Second, Israel -- unlike Iraq -- is not legally obliged to place
its nuclear facilities under the International Atomic Energy Agency
because it is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty. Resolution 487 condemns Israel for attacking Iraq's nuclear
facility at Osirak over 20 years ago, an act for which the
international community is now profoundly grateful.</LD>

<LD>Re "CIA Director Defends Agency at 9/11 Hearing," Oct. 18: President
Bush's CIA chief George Tenet has stated that we are no less subject
to attack now than on 9/11. This means that the Bush administration
has made absolutely no progress toward protecting our nation in more
than 13 months.</LD>
<LD>   Now there are the revelations about the North Korean nuclear arms
program. Although North Korea has missiles capable of hitting the
U.S., Bush hopes to resolve the problem "diplomatically" while
pushing for all-out war against the much-smaller threat from Iraq.
This was Bush's chance to show it is not all about oil, but now it is
obvious that oil is all that matters to Bush. It will be even worse
than Tenet states when President Pervez Musharraf falls in Pakistan,
where Bush allowed Al Qaeda to form again.</LD>
<LD>   All that matters is oil and making money for the most
bought-and-sold politician in history.</LD>

<TE>   The U.S. could instantly gain added global credibility for the
Iraq war initiative if it would commit to letting the U.N. determine
the fate of Iraq's oil as part of any post-war scenario. Until the
U.S. makes this commitment, its claims for the need for regime change
in Iraq due to its possession of weapons of mass destruction and
Saddam Hussein's generally being really evil seem a bit contrived.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.' delayed reaction to the North Korean revelations, where,
apparently, diplomacy is the right approach, only enhances the need
for an "it's not the oil (stupid)" declaration.</TE>

<TE>   I find it amazing that Leon V. Sigal ("A Bombshell That's Actually
an Olive Branch," Commentary, Oct. 18) could analyze the intentions
of Kim Jong Il's regime without a single reference to its horrific
human rights record. His conclusion that Pyongyang wants to bargain
away the weapons of mass destruction program it has been illicitly
developing for normal relations with the U.S. and others assumes that
North Korea is near being a normal state.</TE>
<TE>   A regime that runs a massive gulag system, tests chemical weapons
on humans and starves its population can't risk normal relations. In
attempting self-preservation, the North Korean regime's strongest
card to play is the nuclear blackmail that has won it hundreds of
millions of dollars from the U.S. and others. My bet is that North
Korea does all it can to hang on to its weapons of mass destruction.</TE>

<TE>   Let's see, now. Back in 1994, President Clinton and his merry band
of naive excuses for statesmen awarded North Korea a nuclear power
plant in exchange for a promise to not develop a nuclear weapon. No
verification, no nothing; just a nuke plant in exchange for a
promise. Yet Clinton now wants to tell the world how Bush ought to be
doing things. I'd call that an example of misleading by the
misguided. A bit more of this activity and Clinton will be ready to
run the U.N.</TE>

<LD>I am writing this letter because I have to express my frustration. I
have two children, 4 and 6, and we are in the middle of our eighth
fund-raiser in six weeks.</LD>
<LD>   My son has had to sell candy for soccer, wrapping paper, gifts and
magazines for his school, entertainment books for his school and now
jewelry for his after-school program. My daughter's school is
involved in its second fund-raiser in the past two weeks.
Furthermore, there is another wrapping paper/gift fund-raiser for our
temple.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to support these organizations (and so would my
children's out-of-town grandparents), but this is ridiculous! If I
purchased only one thing from each catalog it would cost this single,
working parent more than $100. There is no one else to sell to, since
all our neighbors, friends and relatives have their own kids involved
in their schools and organizations.</LD>
<TE>   What makes things even worse are the virtually unattainable
"prizes" that are used to entice our kids to sell more. Does anyone
out there realize how much our kids are pressured to sell this stuff?
When is this going to end?</TE>

<LD>Even though I am in favor of using as many resources as possible to
track down and capture the Beltway sniper before he strikes again, I
am against using military surveillance planes to find him ("High
Degree of Terror Swayed Military to Act," Oct. 17). Though it may be
tempting to use the military, it sets a dangerous precedent.
According to federal law, the military is only supposed to be
involved in foreign matters, not domestic affairs. There is good
reason for this. For if the military becomes increasingly involved in
domestic matters, it may try to control our country, as it does in so
many other areas of the world. Capturing one criminal is not worth
losing our freedoms over.</LD>

they can't find a sniper who is operating in their own backyard and
drives a white Chevy Astro van with a ladder on it. Yet we're
expected to believe that we will be able to find Saddam Hussein in a
foreign country that we know little about over 10,000 miles away and
who, unfortunately, doesn't drive a Chevy Astro. Is there something
wrong with this picture?</TE>

<HD>Daughter's Rottweilers Badly Maul Visiting Mother</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 78-year-old woman was in serious but stable condition Monday after
being attacked by four Rottweilers at her daughter's Capistrano Beach
home.</LD>
<LD>   "It was pretty nasty," said Lt. Dave Wilson, a spokesman for the
Orange County Sheriff's Department. "The good news is that she
doesn't have any injuries to her neck or head. She does have some
pretty substantial punctures and tears to her left thigh and both
arms, though, and they were pretty serious wounds."</LD>
<LD>   The woman, identified by neighbors as Janice Divel, was visiting
her daughter and the daughter's roommate in the 34200 block of Camino
El Molino about 9:30 a.m. when the attack occurred. According to
Wilson, Divel, whose home is nearby, was sitting on a couch in the
living room when the daughter went into another room, leaving Divel
in view of her daughter's four dogs, which were in the backyard
behind a screen door.</LD>
<TE>   "For some reason they were agitated that she was there," Wilson
said. "We don't know why."</TE>
<TE>   The dogs were able to break or pop the screen door open and attack
the woman, Wilson said. "She managed to defend herself pretty well,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Divel's daughter, Clara Adair, could not be reached for comment
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Kay Bogart, who lives across the street, said neighbors have
complained about the dogs many times, and local animal control
officials have been to the house on several occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Divel was taken to San Clemente Hospital and Medical Center where
she underwent several hours of surgery, Wilson said.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs were taken to a local animal shelter, where they were
being held pending the outcome of an investigation, into the case,
police said.</TE>

<HD>Doctors Say Baby Should Be Taken Off Life Support</HD>
<DH>The father of the comatose 1-year-old faces abuse charges,
which could become a murder count if the child dies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two doctors testified Monday that an Orange County boy will never
recover from brain injuries allegedly inflicted by his father and
said they believe he should be removed from life support. The
testimony came at the opening of a hearing on the fate of 1-year-old
Christopher Ibarra, who has been in a coma and on life support from
the day he was carried into an emergency room 10 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's mother, Tamara Sepulveda, has been fighting for months
to have her son removed from the ventilator that pumps oxygen into
his lungs, saying that she wants to end his suffering and "let him go
to heaven."</LD>
<LD>   Christopher's father, Moises Ibarra, who faces child abuse charges
and is being held in Orange County Jail, opposes the efforts, arguing
that he wants to preserve the boy's life while he hopes for a
miracle. Tamara Sepulveda has said she believes the father has an
ulterior motive: If the boy dies, Ibarra probably will be charged
with murder.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Richard Behn is attempting to resolve the
matter. The first two witnesses were doctors from Children's Hospital
of Orange County. They testified that they believe Christopher will
never wake from his coma and would almost certainly die if removed
from life-support machines.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't have [a] meaningful life. This is the way Christopher
will be," said Dr. David Hicks, who testified after visiting
Christopher at a long-term care hospital in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, the boy's parents sat about eight feet apart but
did not look at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher's father has pleaded not guilty to felony child abuse
and is awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courtroom, Tamara Sepulveda said she has stopped
visiting her son because she can't stand the emotional pain. "I'm
hurt inside.... Any parent would be," she said. "It's tough on me to
see my son like this."</TE>

<HD>Attorneys for Blake Appeal Denial of Bail</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Andrew Blankstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing a judicial Catch-22, attorneys for Robert Blake appealed to
the California Supreme Court on Monday to overturn a judge's decision
to deny bail for the 69-year-old actor.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash ruled last
week that prosecutors had presented enough evidence supporting the
charge that Blake killed his wife last year in an ambush near a
Studio City restaurant to justify holding the actor, pending trial.</LD>
<LD>   But Venice civil rights lawyer Paul L. Hoffman and Blake defense
attorney Harland W. Braun argued in a 25-page petition that
prosecutors had not shown clear and convincing evidence for the
special circumstance of lying in wait, which turns the case against
Blake into a capital murder case.</LD>
<TE>   Without the capital murder charge, Blake would be eligible for
release. He faces life in prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   At Braun's request, the state Supreme Court ordered the hearing
last week at which Nash ruled that Blake should be held. The lawyers
contend that Nash prevented witness testimony, and said he would
allow only declarations at the bail hearing. But he later ruled that
the declarations were inadmissible.</TE>
<TE>   Nash said he would reconsider Blake's motion for bail after the
preliminary hearing, now set to begin Dec. 11 in Van Nuys. Blake has
been held without bail at the Men's Central Jail since his April 18
arrest in the murder of Bonny Lee Bakley, 44.</TE>

<HD>Stanley Chyet, 71; Rabbi Was Leader in Skirball's Creation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rabbi Stanley F. Chyet, prominent scholar and professor of American
Jewish history, translator of Hebrew literature, poet and force in
the creation of Skirball Cultural Center, has died at age 71.</LD>
<LD>   Chyet died Saturday at his home in Sherman Oaks after a two-year
battle with cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Along with Rabbi Uri D. Herscher, founding president and chief
executive officer of Skirball, Chyet formulated the mission for the
15-acre cultural center that opened in the Sepulveda Pass in 1996.
The Skirball, which has welcomed more than 3 million visitors,
illustrates the connection between ancient Jewish heritage and
American democratic ideals.</LD>
<TE>   Chyet's expertise on American Jewish history was key to developing
the center's core exhibit, "Visions and Values: Jewish Life from
Antiquity to America."</TE>
<TE>   "Stanley Chyet was a utopian in the truest sense of the word,"
Herscher said Sunday. "He set aside any personal ambitions for the
civility of community and hopes for a better world. He was a
brilliant human being with a warm heart, and he has touched us all.</TE>
<TE>   "His scholarship was translated into a living institution,"
Herscher continued. "His poetry extended the human experience. All
those who visit the Skirball for all generations to come will be
touched directly by his legacy."</TE>
<TE>   For the last 20 years, as the Skirball was envisioned and
developed, Chyet served as assistant to Herscher and secretary to the
center's board of trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Revere, Mass., Chyet attended Boston Latin School and was
a Phi Beta Kappa in the first graduating class of Brandeis University
in Waltham, Mass., in 1952. He went on to Hebrew Union College-Jewish
Institute of Religion in Cincinnati, where he was ordained in 1957
and earned his doctorate in 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Chyet began his teaching career on the Cincinnati campus and in
1976 moved to Los Angeles, where he served from 1978 until his 1997
retirement as director of the Edgar F. Magnin School of Graduate
Studies at the College Institute of Religion at Hebrew Union
College-Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Concurrent with his teaching, from 1960 to 1978, Chyet was
associate director of the American Jewish Archives and editor of the
Journal of the American Jewish Archives.</TE>
<TE>   As interested in literature as in history, Chyet became a
prominent translator and editor, as well as author of biographies and
other books and articles. When he translated the Hebrew poetry volume
"Words in My Lovesick Blood" by Haim Gouri for publication in English
in 1997, the Jerusalem Post commented that more analysis by Chyet
would be welcome, but also said in a review that the "clear
achievement in this collection is conveying the poetic feel of each
selection."</TE>
<TE>   Chyet translated and wrote poetry for publication in such journals
as Midstream, Reconstructionist, Jewish Spectator and the Skirball's
publication Oasis. Often with Warren Bargad, he also translated and
edited books of poetry, including "Israeli Poetry: A Contemporary
Anthology" in 1986 and the just-published "No Sign of Ceasefire."</TE>
<TE>   Next year, the Skirball Cultural Center plans to publish a volume
of poetry by Chyet titled "The Lord Has a Taste for Clowning."</TE>
<TE>   Chyet, who served as a chaplain in the Army Reserve, was active in
the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the Assn. for Jewish
Studies, the American Jewish Historical Society, the Labor Zionist
Alliance, the Jewish Publication Society of America, Americans for
Peace Now, the NAACP and Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Geraldine Ann Hyman Chyet; a son,
Michael, and a daughter, Susan Chyet Ware.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today in the Magnin
Auditorium of Skirball Cultural Center.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial donations can be made to the John Wayne Cancer Institute,
St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, or to the Skirball Cultural
Center.</TE>

<HD>Police Cover-Up Alleged in Shooting of Girl</HD>
<DH>Lawyers for the foster child charged with assaulting a
Ventura officer contend the officer wasn't in danger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-year-old foster child was threatening only herself when Ventura
police found her holding a knife in May and critically wounded her
with gunshots to the stomach, her lawyers and father said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Kristin Rupp, who shot the girl, has been cleared of
wrongdoing. The girl's trial on one felony count of assaulting an
officer with a deadly weapon -- a kitchen knife with an 8-inch blade
-- is scheduled to begin next week in Juvenile Court.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the girl, who is identified in court documents as
Anna G., held a news conference Monday to rally public support for
her defense. They said the girl is innocent and police are accusing
her to cover up a rookie officer's mistake. "We believe that the
crime didn't occur until after the police thought about it awhile,"
said lawyer David Brockway of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The case has drawn the attention of Chinese reporters, who were at
the news conference, because the girl was born in China and her
father is Chinese. Her mother was last known to be in China, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Anna has recovered from her injuries and is currently in Juvenile
Hall.</TE>
<TE>   She had been living in foster homes because she and her father
fought about a boyfriend he did not approve of, her father said.
Court records show that the father was convicted last year of
corporal injury to a child. Brockway confirmed that the child is Anna
and that she was taken out of his care.</TE>
<TE>   When Anna threatened to kill herself at her Ventura foster home
the night of May 5, her foster parents called police. Officers found
the girl holding a knife, said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Miles Weiss.
Anna ignored officers' repeated demands to drop the knife and when
she advanced toward Rupp, the 23-year-old officer shot her in the
abdomen, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, who speaks and understands English, had "ample
opportunity" to comply with officers, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "She never dropped the knife until after she was shot" and fell to
the kitchen floor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyers and father dispute that account, saying she let go of
the knife once she saw the officers and never intended to harm
police.</TE>
<TE>   Her father said the police should have tried another way to
control the emotionally troubled girl, suggesting pepper spray or a
stun gun. Anna spent eight days at Ventura County Medical Center,
recovering from her wounds.</TE>
<TE>   If found guilty, the girl faces a maximum of four years in
custody, but it is unlikely she will be incarcerated, Weiss said.
Instead, she would probably enter a treatment program for juvenile
criminals.</TE>

<HD>Board to Discuss Use of Mexican IDs</HD>
<DH>Consulate cards issued to immigrants could be allowed as
official identification at Ventura County government offices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors today will consider allowing Mexican
immigrants -- legal or illegal -- to use a Mexican identification
card to do business at county offices.</LD>
<LD>   The state of California and a handful of local governments have
begun accepting the card, a matricula consular, as valid ID, said
Supervisor John Flynn, who will ask his colleagues on the Board of
Supervisors to do the same.</LD>
<LD>   Acceptance of the card would allow Mexican nationals residing here
to obtain marriage certificates, business licenses, senior discounts
and library cards, the supervisor said.</LD>
<TE>   It also would encourage undocumented immigrants to report crimes
and cooperate with police, Flynn said. Many fear being detained by
law enforcement because they lack proper ID, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed that illegal immigrants could not use the cards to
obtain government benefits or to alter their legal status. Nor does
it confer driving privileges to undocumented motorists, a
controversial benefit sought by legislation that was vetoed by Gov.
Gray Davis last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This will make the lives of people living here more comfortable,"
said Flynn, whose Oxnard-based district includes the county's largest
immigrant population. "It should not be controversial at all."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of immigration control, however, say that if Ventura
County agrees to accept the card as valid ID, it will legitimize
people who have broken laws to enter the country.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are in the country legally have documentation, so the
only people who need these cards are illegal aliens," said David Ray,
spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American
Immigration Reform, an immigration watchdog group. "They should be
accepted by government offices only as a one-way bus pass back to the
border."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a critic of illegal
immigration, called Flynn's proposal absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a quasi-amnesty, and I disagree with that," Gallegly said.
"We are a country of immigrants. But we are also a country of laws.
And we are seeing a tremendous backlash to immigration overall as a
result of illegal immigration."</TE>
<TE>   With the nation focused on rooting out terrorism here and abroad,
the matricula provides another avenue for terrorists to claim they
are legally in the country, the congressman said.</TE>
<TE>   "This document is issued by a foreign government," he said. "We
don't have any control over who gets them and the legitimacy of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Consul Fernando Gamboa, of the Oxnard consulate, asked
Flynn to bring the proposal to the board. San Francisco and Oakland
accept the matricula as official identification, and Los Angeles is
doing so on a trial basis.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties also accept it.
In June, the state Assembly passed a resolution urging all local
governments to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making a special effort to get this accepted in all
counties in California," Gamboa said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez says there is good reason.
Immigrants were being robbed in the city's downtown, targeted by
thieves who knew they were carrying large amounts of cash because
they did not have the identification necessary to open a bank
account, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, however, the problem has waned because Wells
Fargo and Bank of America have agreed to accept the matricula as
formal ID, the chief said.</TE>
<TE>   The card also helps law enforcement quickly identify criminal
suspects, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "Making an identification can sometimes be very difficult and
confusing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks is on vacation, and could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Undersheriff Craig Underwood said the department needs to study
Flynn's proposal before taking a position.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to enter into discussions on why the proposal is needed
and what its implications are for law enforcement," Underwood said.</TE>

<HD>Landfill Would Be Irvine Co.'s Gift (or Liability) to
County</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Irvine Co. is offering the county an unusual gift: a 35-year-old
methane gas-loaded landfill in the middle of the company's East
Orange development area.</LD>
<LD>   The Santiago Canyon landfill sits on Irvine Co. land but has been
operated by the county, which plans to grade, cap and replant it by
2004. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the developer's offer at
its meeting today.</LD>
<LD>..   County waste management officials say the transfer of the 112-acre
Santiago Canyon landfill and a 1,000-foot buffer around it would help
prevent development in the area. Officials say building on or around
the landfill could be dangerous because of the methane, a highly
explosive vapor produced by decaying trash, and could bring lawsuits.</LD>
<TE>   But some call the gift nothing more than a ruse by the company to
shift potential liability and cleanup costs to the public. They note
that the landfill is protected open space, having been included in
the Nature Reserve of Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "This doesn't do anything but transfer all the liability to the
county. That's not a gift I would take," said Chris Koontz, a USC
junior who sued the company over a piece of its East Orange plans,
and won concessions on runoff and wildlife. "This is a great deal for
the Irvine Co.... There is a lot of liability associated with owning
a former landfill, because methane can leave the site."</TE>
<TE>   The Irvine Co. said the county has always assumed full
responsibility for the landfill and planned to eventually take
control of it.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no shift of liability," Irvine Co. spokesman John
Christensen said late Monday. County officials couldn't be reached
after office hours for a reply. Earlier in the day, county waste
management spokeswoman Linda Hagthrop said she could not comment on
whether the county was increasing its risk by assuming ownership of
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Under state and federal law, a landfill operator "has the most
significant responsibility," and the landowner is "responsible for
ensuring the operator does what the law says," said Karen Hodel,
program manager for the Orange County Solid Waste Local Enforcement
Agency.</TE>
<TE>   Koontz said it would be wiser for the county and the Irvine Co. to
continue to share the costs and risks associated with closing the
landfill.</TE>
<TE>   James Carter, a board member of the Nature Reserve of Orange
County, also expressed misgivings. "It's like you're donating your
old, leaking septic system to the county, and them saying 'Oh, thank
you.' It hardly makes sense."</TE>
<TE>   The site, off Santiago Canyon Road between the Eastern tollway and
Irvine Lake, has been leased by the county for landfill operations
since 1967. The landfill stopped accepting trash in 1996, but the
county has continued to rent it at an average cost of $2,000 per
month.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working with the county to bring closure to our
involvement," said Irvine Co. spokesman Christensen.</TE>
<TE>   While no development is planned on or near the landfill, Hagthrop
said the county wants to be on the safe side.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't want to take any chances.... Problems tend to arise
when buildings are placed on or near a landfill," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The landfill, which holds about 23.7 million cubic yards of
refuse, generates about 1,100 cubic feet of methane per minute, said
Hagthrop.</TE>
<TE>   There is a methane disposal and monitoring system at the site to
disperse the vapor in the air.</TE>
<TE>   Hodel said that, legally, methane cannot exceed about 5% of normal
air. She said the site once "occasionally" had higher readings, but
those excessive emissions were quickly reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Hagthrop said the county, by owning the property, could also
consider conversion of the methane to electricity, which could be
used on the site while grading, trash-covering and other closure work
occurs.</TE>

<HD>Richard McSorley, 88; Jesuit Priest Committed to Pacifism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Richard T. McSorley, a Jesuit priest, retired professor of
peace studies at Georgetown University and writer of eight books on
pacifism and social justice, has died. He was 88.</LD>
<LD>   McSorley died Thursday at Georgetown University Hospital in
Washington, D.C. He had coronary artery disease.</LD>
<LD>   An intellectual and an activist committed to pacifism, McSorley
lived in the lofty world of ideas and debate as well as the dissident
one of public protest against what he saw as rampant U.S. militarism.
His opposition to war and war preparation was reflected in a long
arrest record for street demonstrations, the founding of the Center
for Peace Studies at Georgetown and the denouncing of the Just War
theory and of military solutions to conflict. Often at odds, not only
with his government, but also with his own religious order -- the
Society of Jesus -- his fervor for nonviolence once led to his
standing in the center of the Georgetown campus protesting the
school's ROTC program with a large sign: "Should we teach life and
love or death and hate?"</LD>
<TE>   "Dick McSorley was resolute in his convictions for peace and for
racial justice," the Rev. Robert F. Drinan, a fellow Jesuit and
former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, said Thursday.
"Some saw him as a troublemaker, in the good sense, but he was deeply
convinced of the necessity for nonviolent solutions to problems."</TE>
<TE>   McSorley's early priestly training gave little hint of his
eventual antiwar mission. One of 15 children in an Irish Catholic
Philadelphia family -- seven siblings joined religious orders -- he
entered a Jesuit seminary in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., at age 18.</TE>
<TE>   "We were created to praise, love and serve God and our neighbors,
and in this way to save our souls," he wrote in his 1996
autobiography, "My Path to Peace and Justice." "The purpose of life
was the same as the purpose of Jesuit life."</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, after studying philosophy, he was sent to the Philippines
to teach. In December 1941, a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbor, he and other Jesuits were captured by Japanese soldiers. He
endured sickness and starvation in a camp holding 2,500 prisoners.
After he was liberated in 1945, he returned home to be ordained a
priest.</TE>
<TE>   At his first parish, St. James in Ridge, Md., he was stunned by
the overt segregation, including the separation of whites and blacks
at the Communion rail. "As I consulted brother Jesuits," he recalled,
"this was the advice I received: If you speak out about segregation,
you will never be appointed to any position of honor in the Jesuit
order. I knew of no one else in the [order] who spoke out against
segregation. I would be alone."</TE>
<TE>   In 1952, and after four years of agitation, he was assigned to
teach philosophy at Scranton University. "The respectable position of
philosophy professor would silence any rumor that I was being
punished for my views," he wrote. Nine years later, and after
completing a doctorate at Ottawa University -- he wrote his thesis on
"The Roots of Prejudice" -- he went to Georgetown University. From
1961 until 1985, his courses on peace and justice routinely
overflowed, with many students attending for no credit.</TE>
<TE>   During these years, he marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. in the South, shared a jail cell with pediatrician Benjamin Spock
after an antiwar demonstration, volunteered with Mitch Snyder at
Washington's Community for Creative Nonviolence, helped found two
Catholic Worker houses of hospitality in Washington, and worked with
pacifist priests Daniel and Philip Berrigan, designing such academic
courses as "The Nonviolent Revolution of Peace." He pressed to have
the ROTC removed from campus, and he offered moral support to draft
resisters.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, while in London, McSorley chanced upon a recent
Georgetown graduate, Bill Clinton. With the Vietnam War raging,
Clinton asked the priest to say a prayer for peace at an
interdenominational service at St. Mark's Church. Afterward, antiwar
marchers carried small white crosses to protest at the U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   The incident surfaced during the Clinton presidential campaign in
1992. Republican strategists sought to portray Clinton, the
candidate, as a dupe of a notoriously left-wing priest. Rep. Robert
Dornan, co-chairman of the Bush campaign in California, took to the
House floor to rail against McSorley as "a Marxist priest" who was
"pro-fascist" and "still poisoning the minds" of Georgetown students
with "garbage." President George H.W. Bush raised the
Clinton-McSorley connection to question Clinton's "character and
judgment."</TE>
<TE>   During the campaign firestorm, McSorley, back in his office at the
Center for Peace Studies, was besieged with requests for media
interviews, which he turned down. The priest later told the
Washington Post, "If more people prayed for peace, as Bill Clinton
did in 1969, the world would be a better place."</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include two brothers and four sisters.</TE>

<HD>Fumes Prompt Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Attorney general files the action against a Lockwood Valley
mine for alleged violations of air quality standards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Lockwood Valley mining operator is facing millions of dollars in
fines after the state attorney general's office filed a civil suit
claiming the firm was polluting the air and endangering the health of
Frazier Park residents.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors charge that Pacific Custom Materials Inc. repeatedly
exceeded acceptable limits of sulfur dioxide emissions as it burned
diesel fuel during the manufacture of lightweight concrete, fireproof
roof tiles and skid-resistant highway surfaces.</LD>
<LD>   Neighbors have long complained of dizziness, nausea, painful
breathing and skin irritation. In 1999, they filed suit against the
company, a division of Dallas-based Texas Industries. The suit is
pending.</LD>
<TE>   The attorney general's action was filed Oct. 15 in Ventura County
Superior Court on behalf of the state Air Resources Board and the
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District.</TE>
<TE>   It asks for fines of from $1,000 to $1 million per day since the
violations were first recorded about two years ago. The number of
days of violations has yet to be determined, but investigators found
that the company exceeded emissions standards on at least five
occasions.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not seen the complaint yet, but we are a little surprised
because we had been working closely with the air pollution district
in Ventura to assure we maintain compliance at that facility," said
Pacific Custom spokesman Frank Sheets. "We thought we were making
progress. We have environmental monitors there continuously."</TE>
<TE>   But Keith Duval, who heads the compliance division of the Ventura
County Air Pollution Control District, said that because of previous
violations, Pacific Custom was under stringent emission limits. "The
recent data we received shows they have gone higher than those limits
-- sometimes as much as 50% to 60%," Duval said.</TE>
<TE>   Using temporary pollution control measures, the clay mine was able
to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions in 2000. But neighbors didn't
notice any difference.</TE>
<TE>   "It smells like diesel fuel and sometimes it smells like
turpentine," said Sylvia Richards-Swan, who lives about 200 yards
from the plant. "It takes your breath away. It's like having a diesel
truck sitting in my living room."</TE>
<TE>   The company occupies 380 acres a few miles from Frazier Park and
leases mining claims on 580 acres nearby. The clay is mixed with up
to 3.2 million gallons of diesel fuel each year and burned in kilns.
According to air quality officials, no other plant in Southern
California uses more diesel fuel.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been in the environmental business for 36 years, and this
is mind-boggling," said William Dunlop, an attorney for Environmental
World Watch in Northridge. "People living beside the plant had
nosebleeds, their hair was falling out, their horses had stillborn
[foals]. The air is literally unbreathable."</TE>
<TE>   The attorney general's suit calls for a wide range of fines for
violating pollution standards and endangering public health. It said
a "considerable number of persons" suffered injuries to their health
and safety requiring medical treatment because of the plant.</TE>
<TE>   "The violations are significant and repetitive in nature,
occurring over several different testing periods," Duval said.
"Sulfur dioxide in high levels can have significant health impacts."</TE>

<LD>Sheriff's deputies are looking for a Laguna Beach man they say
kidnapped his former girlfriend from a San Clemente parking lot and
raped her at a La Jolla hotel.</LD>
<LD>   Enrico Leonard Amato, 33, was being sought on a no-bail warrant
after forcing his way into the 23-year-old woman's car at a shopping
center in the 600 block of Camino de los Mares about 6:45 p.m.
Sunday, deputies said. They said he tied her with strips of clothing
and drove her to the La Jolla Radisson Court hotel.</LD>
<LD>   She escaped and called police about 3:45 a.m. Monday after Amato
fell asleep, said Jim Amormino, a spokesman for the Orange County
Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   Amato fled on foot, Amormino said.</TE>

<HD>William Parkes, 106; WWI Member of Welch Fusiliers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sgt. William Parkes, the last surviving member of Britain's Royal
Welch Fusiliers who saw battle during World War I, has died in
California. He was 106.</LD>
<LD>   Parkes died Oct. 7 in Napa, where he had lived for 70 years.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, Parkes joined other World War I veterans in receiving the
Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur, which had been authorized by the
French government two years earlier to honor Allies and to mark the
80th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice, which ended the
Great War on Nov. 11, 1918.</LD>
<TE>   Gerard Coste, the French consul general in San Francisco, pinned
the green and white medal on Parkes as he sat in his wheelchair in
Napa on Dec. 14, 2000. A representative of the Fusiliers also
presented Parkes with a Royal Welch Fusiliers Millennium Plate for
his historic service to the military unit.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Newport, Monmouthshire, England, on Jan. 18, 1896, Parkes
was the fifth of 11 children and outlived all the rest.</TE>
<TE>   He enlisted at age 19 with the 12th Battalion of the 24th Regiment
of the South Wales Borderers, a unit of the Fusiliers, and was
trained as a machine gunner and combat infantryman. He fought in the
trenches in Belgium and France, and was wounded, his leg shredded by
shrapnel.</TE>
<TE>   "Wrap it up, wrap it up tight, I gotta get back in there," he
recalled more than 80 years later that he had told a medical
corpsman. The leg, however, collapsed when Parkes tried to stand.</TE>
<TE>   The slightly built soldier -- 5-foot-5, 140 pounds -- specialized
in what he called "reconnoitering."</TE>
<TE>   "Us little guys could hide much better than the tall guys," he
told the San Francisco Chronicle two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In 1920, Parkes immigrated to the United States, and stayed
briefly with relatives in Pennsylvania. But a year later, he visited
the San Francisco Bay Area and decided never to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Dubbed "the speedy little Welshman," he was a member of the San
Francisco Barbarians soccer team, which won the state championship in
1922-23.</TE>
<TE>   Parkes moved to Napa in 1932 and worked for 29 years as an
occupational therapist at Napa. He built his own house and in 1938
married Florence "Dolly" Nelson, who died in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Papa Will" had no children, he sponsored many relatives
who emigrated from England and Wales and was close to his nieces and
nephews and their grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He also
enjoyed visiting schools to share his century of memories with
children.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial contributions can be made to St. Jude Cancer Research in
Memphis.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles police on Monday released a composite sketch of a man
suspected in the kidnap and rape of a 14-year-old Monroe High School
student last week while investigating possible links to similar
attacks or attempted assaults in the northeast San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now we're looking at similar cases in the city," Det. Jesse
Alvarado said. "But we're not saying it is or is not related....
Comparing cases is part of our protocol."</LD>
<LD>   Detectives declined to provide further details about other attacks
in the area that might be related to last week's rape.</LD>
<TE>   The victim in Friday's assault was walking to school between 6:30
and 7 a.m. in the 9000 block of Willis Avenue when the suspect pulled
up in a mid-1990s white Honda Accord and offered to give her a lift,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   When the girl refused, the man drove farther up the block. After
parking his car, he again approached the victim, simulated pointing a
gun and forced her into the car. He then drove her to an alley about
two blocks away where he assaulted her, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators described the suspect as an Asian man in his early
20s, 5 foot 3, weighing 120 pounds with brown eyes, black hair and
pock-marked skin. He was wearing a white hooded sweater, black or
gray shorts and white shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers at Monroe High School on Monday distributed 5,000 fliers
with safety tips for students walking to and from school. Students
were told to walk with a friend or in a group on well-lighted
streets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the worst," Principal Greg Vallone said of the attack. "To
hear something like this happen to any of our students, you take it
personal. It's critical it doesn't happen to any of our other
students."</TE>
<TE>   Vallone said he had yet to receive a call from school police or
the LAPD as of Monday morning about the incident. He said he learned
of the assault from the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know what had gone down," he said. "It's always
helpful to communicate. Cooperation among agencies is how we solve
problems."</TE>
<TE>   He said even the district's media office was unaware of the
incident. Ellen Morgan, a spokeswoman for the district, said school
police would normally inform her office of such a case.</TE>

<LD>Set on a gritty boulevard near downtown Santa Ana, the Bargain

<LD>   Much to Moreno's chagrin, however, the city says the operation has
violated city codes since the day it opened 13 years ago and should
become one large store or close.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the kind of place that's good for us," said Moreno, a
mother of three, as she browsed the booths one day last week. "The
prices are low, we can walk here and it's a nice place just to walk
around. Why would anyone want to close it?"</LD>
<TE>   City officials say the mall, on 1st Street near Center Street,
lacks required parking, setbacks and a permit to sublease to
businesses inside. Moreover, they say, mall owner Dale Lee did not
get approval for operating what they contend is an indoor swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Manager Cindy Nelson said the move against the mall is
the result of a 2-year-old commercial code enforcement program.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Avrashow, Lee's attorney, argues that the city wants to
replace a business catering to immigrants with one that's more
upscale. City officials declined to discuss the case in detail,
noting pending litigation by the city.</TE>
<TE>   The mall has 55 stalls in a 30,000-square-foot building. Merchants
pay as little as $300 a month for a space. On weekends and over the
Christmas holiday, the mall teems with bargain-hunting families. The
city says the mall should have 300 parking spots instead of 136. The
city and Lee dispute how many spaces are available. A study done for
the owner showed little overflow parking into adjacent lots -- even
during peak holiday shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not Ralph Lauren," Avrashow said. "It's Mrs. Gomez
selling fashions.... We believe the city just thinks, 'We can get an
upscale business.' They all but said it in a staff report."</TE>
<TE>   The city report states: "Legalizing the indoor swap mall would be
a detriment to the inevitable recycling of this site and the
surrounding area into a more economically productive and stable use."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the merchants in the mall were unaware of the dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know anything," said Xuyen Nguyen, who has sold
inexpensive pots, pans, lamps and toasters in the mall for 10 years.
That the mall could close "scares me."</TE>
<TE>   The dispute began in 2000, when the city issued a citation for
parking, setback and permit violations. In 2001, Lee asked for a
permit to operate the mall. The Planning Commission will consider his
case Monday. City staff recommends that the mall become one retail
operation or shut down if the owner cannot address the violations.</TE>
<TE>   But because he didn't cease operations as ordered, the city this
year filed a criminal misdemeanor complaint, pending in Orange County
Superior Court, City Atty. Joseph W. Fletcher said. Although the mall
has operated for years, Fletcher says that does not mean it should be
allowed to continue.</TE>
<TE>   "When you get a ticket on the freeway ... you can't say, 'I've
been speeding on this freeway every day for the past five years,' "
Fletcher said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's other major indoor swap meet, the Bristol Swap Mall,
got a variance in 1985 that allowed it to operate without the parking
stipulated in city code. It got a city permit.</TE>
<TE>   Avrashow says the Planning Department approved a 1989 plan for
Lee's mall, alternately called Bargain Discount Mall and Universal
Discount Mall. Avrashow said the use plan clearly showed 37
partitions city officials must have seen when Lee gave it to them.</TE>
<TE>   Avrashow conceded that the mall's original certificate of
occupancy said "indoor swap meet is not a permitted use," but the
lawyer said his client did not understand the meaning of the term
"swap meet."</TE>
<TE>   "The city knew from the start what the business would look like.
What did they think when they saw plans for the partitions?" Avrashow
said. "They knew it was not going to be a store like Macy's."</TE>

<HD>Local Race Turns Nasty</HD>
<DH>Candidates for four Thousand Oaks council seats trade
accusations of carpetbagging and improper use of the city seal in
campaign fliers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The battle to control the future of Thousand Oaks shapes up along
familiar lines: a slate of City Council candidates extolling a
slow-growth mantra who want to unseat incumbents accused of being too
cozy with developers.</LD>
<LD>   One of the four seats on the Nov. 5 ballot, to replace incoming
Ventura County Supervisor Linda Parks, is being sought by Randy
Hoffman, the millionaire businessman defeated by the slow-growth
councilwoman in the spring supervisorial election.</LD>
<LD>   He faces Parks' hand-picked successor and slate member, Bob Wilson
Sr., and retired aerospace engineer Don Morris.</LD>
<TE>   In all, a dozen candidates are vying to lead this maturing
suburban city. They are a highly educated and diverse group: two
rocket scientists, an engineer, a pair of Emmy-winning television
producers, a Harvard-trained accountant, a firefighter, a teacher, a
retired police chief, a health-care executive, a marketing manager
and a restaurateur.</TE>
<TE>   Campaigning has turned nasty.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Dennis Gillette has been accused of using the city seal
improperly in campaign brochures, but city lawyers say Gillette can
use the seal in photos because he is an elected officeholder.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman has labeled Wilson a Lake Sherwood carpetbagger who rented
an apartment in the city days before filing for office -- a claim
Wilson says is irrelevant because he has lived in or near Thousand
Oaks for three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Herb Gooch, chairman of the political science department at Cal
Lutheran University, said he is not surprised by the level of
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   That happens when a city is in good shape, he said. And Thousand
Oaks has relatively little crime, is economically healthy and has no
divisive issues on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "The rule of thumb in local politics is: The lower the stakes, the
more vicious the politics," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As usual in this leafy and affluent city not yet 40 years old, the
debate has centered on the pace of development, preserving open space
and traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue is growth. There really is no other issue," Wilson said
at a recent candidates forum. "I do think we can slow this [growth]
down to almost nil."</TE>
<TE>   At 64, the silver-haired owner of Cisco's Mexican Restaurant is
the senior member of the self-proclaimed Certified Slow Growth Team.</TE>
<TE>   Its four members are endorsed by the council's anti-development
minority: Parks and Mayor Ed Masry, the environmental attorney
portrayed in the movie "Erin Brockovich."</TE>
<TE>   The team -- Wilson, Planning Commission Chairwoman Claudia Bill-de
la Pena, former Planning Commissioner Michael Farris and English
teacher Laura Lee Custodio -- is endorsed by the Sierra Club and
several environmental and community groups.</TE>
<TE>   Custodio, 50, lost in runs for the council four years ago and the
school board in 2000. The Newbury Park resident has a law degree and
directs the English department at Granada Hills High School.</TE>
<TE>   Bill-de la Pena, 36, who works as a news writer and is an
Emmy-winning producer for KCBS-TV Channel 2, has served nearly two
years on the Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   She became the chair this spring after Farris was ousted from the
panel, along with Commissioner Nora Aidukas, in a high-profile
political flap.</TE>
<TE>   The pair wanted to delay a vote on a city plan to transfer rights
to develop houses from an area near Hill Canyon to the huge Dos
Vientos project in exchange for leaving as open space 191 acres known
as the Western Plateau.</TE>
<TE>   Farris, 33, has taken this fight to court, claiming that part of
the land swap -- allowing construction of three estate homes where a
private equestrian center was planned -- violates a city ordinance
requiring voters to decide park and open space changes. City lawyers
insist the parcel was only proposed -- not approved -- as a parks
location, years after it was designated for low-density residential
use.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to make sure our wonderful city does not fall captive to
overdevelopment like the San Fernando Valley," said Farris, a former
Assembly candidate who has a doctorate in space physics. "We live in
such a beautiful place with such a high quality of life that it
deserves preserving."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the debate are incumbents Gillette, Dan Del
Campo and Andy Fox. They say their records prove they have acted as
good stewards of the city's land, pushed to acquire more open space
and resisted rampant growth.</TE>
<TE>   Del Campo, 54, said during his four years on the council the city
has doled out fewer than one-third of the housing allotments allowed
under Measure A, a 22-year-old ordinance that limits such permits to
500 a year. He favors a new city law that would require voter
approval before builders can increase the number of dwellings allowed
per parcel.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, a 44-year-old firefighter whose more than $78,000 in campaign
funds is far more than that raised by the other 11 candidates,
characterizes himself as a champion for slow growth and open space
preservation. The two-term incumbent cites conversion of more than
1,500 acres into public open space since he took office and his
authorship of a measure that gives voters the right to weigh in on
any change to the city's General Plan for development.</TE>
<TE>   A statistic Gillette, a former police chief in Thousand Oaks,
likes to cite is that nearly one-third of Thousand Oaks' planning
area, about 15,000 acres, is public open space. That does not include
public parks, golf courses, school campuses or other publicly held
properties. Gillette, 62, was on the Conejo Recreation and Park
District's board when it acquired both McCrea Ranch and Broome Ranch
for permanent open space.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman, 48, is running on his seven-month record as a city
planning commissioner. Hoffman, who teaches management and finance
classes at Cal State Channel Islands, said he has been an independent
voice on the commission. He said he has voted to protect ridgelines
and open space and supported affordable housing for seniors and
working families.</TE>
<TE>   Looking past housing construction, several candidates suggest the
next council will have its hands full addressing a principal
by-product of growth: traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, 58, a retired Rockwell engineer, said some improvements
could include realigning street lanes, retiming traffic lights and
enhancing the city's transportation center. But projects such as
widening the Ventura Freeway near clogged California 23 will require
pressure on Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   David Seagal, 72, a structural engineer making a third run for the
council, encourages greater reliance on ride-sharing, park-and-ride
lots, carpool lanes and giving employees staggered work hours.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, he said, the billions of dollars spent on expanding
freeways could instead go to install rail systems along existing
rights of way to accommodate people and drivers of compact, hybrid
automobiles. He also wants to overhaul the city's administrative
processes and cut cost overruns on construction bids.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about Los Angeles criminals who drop into Thousand Oaks
to rob banks and shoppers, television producer and multimedia
entrepreneur David Sams, 44, proposes placing security cameras at
schools, malls, every major intersection and public gathering places.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to send a clear-cut warning to the bad guys who travel up
and down the 101 that they are not welcome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sams said he wants to run the city like a private business by
putting corporate banners along main thoroughfares for a price. He
moved his family from Bel-Air to Thousand Oaks two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Another relative newcomer is health-care executive Rick Velasquez,
33, who purchased his first home in Thousand Oaks in March 2001.
Velasquez, who served nearly 10 years as an aide to two Los Angeles
County supervisors, supports ongoing audits of city departments to
guarantee efficiency, investing in youth programs, preserving open
space, retaining existing businesses and attracting new ones to the
city.</TE>

<HD>Mixed Field of 13 Test Their Luck in District 3 Race</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The race for the 3rd District seat on the proposed San Fernando
Valley city council pits a longtime political veteran against a field
of mostly novices, including a film editor, an accountant and an
environmental engineer who wants to retest capped water wells.
Together, they make up the largest field of candidates -- 13 --
running for a council post on the Valley secession ballot.</LD>
<LD>   The district takes in Chatsworth, Porter Ranch, the western edge
of Northridge and northern portions of Canoga Park, West Hills and
Winnetka.</LD>
<LD>   There are 14 Valley council contests in the Nov. 5 election. The
offices will be filled only if the Valley secession measure passes.</LD>
<TE>   In the 3rd District, the best-known candidate is Paula Boland, a
former assemblywoman who helped launch the secession campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I started all this, I thought I should be there to help get
[a Valley city] started," said Boland, 62, who introduced an Assembly
bill in 1996 that would have set the stage for a secession measure.
Her bill died in the state Senate, but a compromise version was
approved the following year.</TE>
<TE>   Boland, who was a real estate broker before serving in the
Assembly from 1990 to 1996, has a history of conservative political
activism.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss getting the good stuff done," said the Northridge
resident.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Prince, founding director of Valley VOTE, says he wants to
clean up drug-infested neighborhoods and topple what he calls the
"established dictatorship" at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "All the council districts are the same," said Prince, 66, who
owns a janitorial service. "You have to beg to get anything done.
It's been like that forever."</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Barsky, a business owner who has been active in youth
sports for many years, wants more police officers on the streets. "As
the north Valley grew, I don't think the police grew with it," said
Barsky, 56, of Porter Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Erich D. Miller, who has run for Congress three times on the
Libertarian ticket, says Los Angeles charges too much in taxes and
places too many controls on businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about how many fast-food restaurants there are
on one block," said Miller, 41, a Northridge business owner and
musician. "The market provides what people really want and need."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry England says the Valley needs more police officers, a better
mass-transit system and less development in places such as
Chatsworth, where housing tracts are crowding horse ranches. "It's
ripe for development," said England, 59, who has lived in the Valley
for more than 50 years.</TE>
<TE>   David Gordon Tweet's vision of a Valley city includes a larger
police force with more senior lead officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we need to improve everything," said the 46-year-old
Chatsworth resident, a film editor.</TE>
<TE>   Igaal Barak believes his business experience will be vital if the
Valley breaks away from Los Angeles. He founded a company, HSIS
Schools, that raises capital to build private high schools. "Once the
Valley is independent, we need to run it and do it right," said
Barak, 56, of Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Armineh Safarian Chelebian, 42, says her accounting background
would be essential to a new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to use our tax dollars more wisely," said Chelebian, a
Winnetka resident who has served on leadership councils at two Valley
schools. "We need to lower business taxes and simplify them so the
Valley will be inviting businesses in."</TE>
<TE>   John Regis Kuhn ran unsuccessfully for the Los Angeles school
board during the 1970s' anti-busing movement. As a Valley councilman,
he says he would focus on reducing traffic, slowing growth and
reopening the Northridge Park pool.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm running because I'm not a politician," said Kuhn, 59, a
Chatsworth resident who teaches technical arts at Hale Middle School.
"There are too many politicians in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental engineer Joseph A. Martin wants to have the more
than 300 capped water wells in the Valley retested to see if they are
safe to use. He says many of them were deemed to be polluted 20 years
ago but might be fine now.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no plan to test these wells to see if they are still
polluted," said Martin, 56, a longtime Chatsworth resident.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Goldsobel, 37, of Winnetka says secession would make it
easier to break up the school district.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to Sacramento as our own city, we'll have a much stronger
voice [in pursuing a schools split]," said Goldsobel, a sales manager
for a broadcast equipment company.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis A. Wood, 44, an Army reservist, says the secession campaign
might have been averted if the Valley had been given its own school
district. The L.A. school system is nonfunctioning, said Wood, a
Winnetka resident who has served on two management councils for the
schools. "They are throwing money down executive toilets."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Michael C. Robbe did not return phone calls seeking a
comment.</TE>

<HD>Nolan White, 71; Hot-Rod Driver Set Speed Records</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hot-rodder Nolan White of San Diego, who last August set a land-speed
record for piston-engine cars, died Sunday at the University of Utah
Medical Center in Salt Lake City of injuries suffered in a crash
Thursday on the Bonneville Salt Flats. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   White, driving Spirit of Autopower, a streamliner powered by twin
supercharged Chevrolet engines, averaged 413.156 mph for two runs on
the salt Aug. 12 in the Southern California Timing Assn. speed
trials. That meet was not sanctioned by the Federation International
de Automobile and White was attempting to match or better that speed
for that organization's recognition when he crashed last week.</LD>
<LD>   He had just gone through the speed traps at the end of the
measured mile, at 422 mph, on the first of the required two runs. His
three braking parachutes were all on the same tether, which broke.
White's car veered off the course as he tried to slow it for four
miles with on-board brakes and engine compression, then, nearing
Interstate 80 at the south end of the course, he tried to turn the
vehicle in wet salt. Instead, the car rolled several times and White
suffered multiple injuries. He died without regaining consciousness.</LD>
<TE>   A longtime competitor on the Salt Flats, White and his son and
partner Rick were leaders in the quest for speed in piston-driven
cars, although the much faster jet-powered cars draw most of the
attention. The world land-speed record is 763.035 mph, set in 1997 at
Black Rock Desert, Nev., by Englishman Andy Green, a Royal Air Force
pilot who broke the sound barrier in a car powered by twin jet
engines.</TE>
<TE>   White's record-setting run in August also was not without
incident. Traveling at more than 400 mph, with half a mile to go on
the second run, a tire blew.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not about to shut the car down and was adamant that I would
get through the [timing] lights," he said at the time. "I've had a
half-dozen flat tires at 400 mph. It's a real comfortable car. I've
been doing this for 45 years. Once you are comfortable in your car,
it doesn't bother you. If it bothered me, I'd quit."</TE>
<TE>   White also lost his braking parachutes when the tether broke in
that incident, but managed to stop the car in slushy salt.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete Monday.</TE>

<HD>Hooked on Phonics? We Should Lose This Addiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary Lee Griffin</AU>
<BD>Mary Lee Griffin is an assistant professor of
education at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How bad is this national reading crisis we keep hearing and reading
about?</LD>
<LD>   Federal officials, citing the findings of the National Reading
Panel, have decreed that only "evidence-based" programs that include
the teaching of phonics will be supported with grant money, such as
President Bush's Reading First initiative.</LD>
<LD>   But whose evidence, and how was it gathered, evaluated and
interpreted?</LD>
<TE>   Data of the National Assessment of Educational Progress indicate
that reading achievement has not changed much in 30 years. In fact,
our fourth-grade readers rank second in the world. Only Finland is
ahead of us. So why do politicians proclaim our nation to be in the
midst of a reading crisis that only more phonics and more testing in
the early grades will cure?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe we need to look beyond the elementary grades, where our
reading scores do not compare as favorably with the rest of the
world. Clearly, older students are not as engaged as their younger
counterparts, and their poor reading comprehension is a problem. More
phonics won't help them, but phonics might be a contributing factor
in how they got there.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the politicians say dire situations require drastic measures,
and drastic measures require large expenditures of capital for the
"systems," or evidence-based programs and assessments that will save
the day. Who profits? Not the children required to sit through hours
of "direct instruction in phonics" and read mindless tales of "Nan
and the pan and Dan, the man." Certainly not skilled teachers forced
to use scripted programs that may not serve the needs of their
students.</TE>
<TE>   It is commercial publishers, supported by federal policy makers,
who profit most. Phonics materials, programs and assessments
represent a lucrative business for textbook publishers. Phonics
acquisition is easy to "quantify" by testing before and after
instruction, spawning scores of quasi-experimental studies that prove
the treatment of phonics works. Publishers and scientists get rich,
politicians get elected and students and teachers are bored to tears.</TE>
<TE>   In my 30 years as teacher, reading specialist, literacy researcher
and college professor, I have never met an elementary teacher or
reading specialist who did not teach phonics. Phonics has been part
of every reading initiative over the last few decades, from whole
language and balanced literacy (both literature-based) to the
so-called comprehensive or evidence-based reading programs.</TE>
<TE>   But weren't we told that whole-language teachers never taught
phonics? We were, but it was a lie, just as this current call for
phonics and scripted programs is fraught with questionable truths.</TE>
<TE>   Research has shown that the single most important factor in
students' reading success is skillful teachers. But the idea of
skillful teachers who know students' needs and plan appropriate
instruction based on authentic, classroom-based evidence is
financially terrifying to commercial publishers who want to ensure
that their programs will be bought, used and renewed.</TE>
<TE>   A steady diet of phonics, scripted instruction and decodable texts
in the primary grades crowds out time for the authentic reading and
writing tasks that will build lifelong learners. Even strong readers'
comprehension suffers.</TE>
<TE>   Where does that leave our most vulnerable students, those with
limited literary backgrounds or limited language skills? Faced with
the chasm between school reading and experience, these students also
fail to grasp or retain skills taught through direct phonics
instruction. As a result, they do poorly even on phonics-related
tasks. The effects of such failures are devastating, often depriving
otherwise promising youngsters of the enrichment, both mental and
economic, that comes with the love of reading.</TE>
<TE>   Skilled teachers know that young children work hard, actively
participate and take risks as long as learning makes sense and they
experience success. They also recognize that repeated failure ensures
that our most vulnerable learners will be left behind before they
reach their eighth birthday.</TE>

<HD>This Is Oil -- This Is a No-Brainer on Oil</HD>
<DH>Help win the war on terrorism: Drive smaller cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arianna Huffington</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush team's ridiculous and wildly inflammatory anti-drug ads are
still running in heavy rotation. You know the ads: innocent-looking,
middle-class teens admitting their culpability for the vicious
consequences of the drug trade. "I helped blow up buildings," says
one doe-eyed youth.</LD>
<LD>   So if that is legitimate logic, and our president says it is,
perhaps we should start a little ad campaign of our own to sabotage
another misguided Bush campaign: the war on conservation.</LD>
<LD>   The idea sprang forth after the startling announcement that the
administration was taking precious time off from an actual, necessary
war -- the one on terrorism -- to sue the state of California for
daring to require that car makers put more energy-efficient models on
the road.</LD>
<TE>   Turning the letter of the Federal Clean Air Act against its clear
intent, Department of Justice lawyers lined up on behalf of the
administration's friends in the hydrocarbon-loving auto manufacturing
industry and argued that as long as California's cars were in
compliance with federal standards, the state could not impose tougher
ones.</TE>
<TE>   For those keeping score, the Bush administration is in favor of
states' rights when the states want to weaken federal safety
standards of any kind and against states' rights when the states want
stronger measures.</TE>
<TE>   So how about using the same shock tactics that the administration
uses in the drug war to confront the public with the ultimate
consequences of its energy wastefulness. Imagine a soccer mom in a
Ford Excursion (11 mpg city, 15 mpg highway) saying, "I'm building a
nuclear bomb for Saddam Hussein." Or a mob of solo drivers tootling
down the freeway at 75 mph shouting in unison: "We're buying weapons
that will kill American soldiers, Marines and sailors! Yahoo!"</TE>
<TE>   Scott Burns, co-creator of the "Got Milk?" campaign, already has
two ad scripts ready to go.</TE>
<TE>   The first one feels like an old Slim-Fast commercial. Instead of
"I lost 50 pounds in two weeks," the ad cuts to different people in
their sport utility vehicles: "I gassed 40,000 Kurds," "I helped
hijack an airplane," "I helped blow up a nightclub," and then in
unison: "We did it all by driving to work in our SUVs."</TE>
<TE>   The second ad, which opens on a man at a gas station, features a
child's voice-over throughout: "This is George." Then we see a
close-up of a gas pump. "This is the gas George buys for his car."
Next we see a guy in a suit. "This is the oil company executive who
makes money on the gas George buys." Close-up on Al Qaeda training
film footage: "This is the terrorist organization supported by money
from the country where the oil company does business." It's followed
by footage of 9/11: "We all know what this is." And it closes on a
wide shot of bumper-to-bumper traffic: "The biggest weapon of mass
destruction is parked in your driveway."</TE>
<TE>   Can the administration seriously deny that oil dollars finance a
spreading slick of evil in the world today? In Iraq, oil money has
kept Hussein's repressive regime afloat even in the midst of tough
U.N. sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   In Saudi Arabia, our second-largest foreign supplier of oil, the
money spent at U.S. pumps pays for a feudal monarchy that has gorged
itself on excess while  supporting suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Even our close ally Kuwait, our 11th-largest oil supplier,
manifests an ambivalence toward the U.S. that, if you accept the Bush
administration's drug war arguments about the validity of remote
effects, resulted in this month's assassination of an American Marine
while he was on a military exercise. Thank you, Exxon.</TE>
<TE>   Would it be so painful for us to slow down the intravenous drip of
oil that keeps these hideously anti-American regimes alive? Some
simple conservation measures -- chief among them increasing our
fuel-efficiency -- would greatly reduce our dependence on foreign
oil. There are car companies with electric and hybrid cars already on
the market. And a little pressure on our wasteful ways could unleash
a new wave of good old American inventiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Bush Inc. has sided with the Enrons of the world to stifle
energy-saving technology and keep the U.S. in an artificially
prolonged state of dependence. Of course, waiting for the Bush
administration to get religion on energy conservation would be about
as fruitful as waiting for Hussein to welcome U.S. inspectors into
his palaces. It ain't gonna happen. Unless, that is, the public makes
it happen.</TE>

<HD>Ideologists Go Sniper Hunting</HD>
<DH>Personal beliefs drive theories about the killer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James P. Pinkerton</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"When facts are few," observed the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung,
"speculations are most likely to represent individual psychology."</LD>
<LD>   Or political ideology -- as in the case of the Washington, D.C.,
sniper.</LD>
<LD>   But what can't be argued is that Americans have entered into a
second era of terror, an era likely to end as the last one did, in
tougher security measures at home and abroad.</LD>
<TE>   Especially around Washington, it was inevitable that speculation
about the identity of the killer would cleave along ideological
lines. Those on the political right often have suggested that the
sniper could be linked to Al Qaeda or even Saddam Hussein. In this
camp one finds William Kristol of the Weekly Standard, Chris Ruddy of
Newsmax.com, various talking heads on Fox News and syndicated
columnist Michelle Malkin, who has just published a book on the
dangers of unrestricted immigration.</TE>
<TE>   Such speculation, of course, feeds into the hawkish worldview that
the U.S. is under siege by foreigners and foreign terror. And so part
of the solution, as Frank Gaffney of the pro-Pentagon Center for
Security Policy wrote recently, is to go overseas and "drain the
swamps" of foreign terror.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein not only has the connections to Al Qaeda," Gaffney
argued, but he has the motive of derailing American war plans. Thus
the Iraqi dictator "stands to benefit directly from the distracting
effect of seemingly unrelated terrorist activities elsewhere." By
such logic, the bloody deeds of the Beltway sniper could become yet
another reason to attack Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   On the left side of the political spectrum, guessing has clustered
around a white male as the suspect. Former FBI agent Candice DeLong
was quoted by the New York Times as saying of the shooter, "I see him
all into this stealth ninja stuff, walking around with a swagger,
used to bossing people around, maybe a fireman or construction
worker." And Democratic-activist-turned-"Crossfire" host James
Carville declared, "This guy strikes me as someone who has either law
enforcement training or military training." CNN reported that violent
video games could be the cause. Washington Post columnist Richard
Cohen, meanwhile, seized the moment to attack "gun nuts" for blocking
greater gun control.</TE>
<TE>   The same sort of what-you-believe-determines-what-you-see dynamic
was visible in the case of the anthrax mailings last year. In that
murder rampage, too, the right was quick to pin the blame on Arab
terrorists, while the left, notably New York Times columnist Nicholas
Kristof, all but convicted Stephen Hatfill, a medical researcher who
had worked for a time in South Africa. That in turn led to a cover
story in the Weekly Standard endorsing Hatfill's innocence, pushing
the blame back onto foreigners. The case, of course, remains
unsolved.</TE>
<TE>   One case that was solved was the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. In
the hours after the April 19 explosion, terrorism expert Steven
Emerson told CBS News: "This was done with the intent to inflict as
many casualties as possible. That is a Middle Eastern trait." Two
white male Americans were convicted of that act, although seven years
later, conspiracy theorists are still buzzing about a Philippines
connection.</TE>
<TE>   Here's one thing we know for sure. Terror comes in waves. In the
U.S., the effect of the Civil War, plus the upsetting effects of
industrialization and immigration, helped create a climate of chaos
and terror. So three American presidents were assassinated between
1865 and 1901. And a former president, Theodore Roosevelt, was
wounded in 1912. As a result, the U.S. Secret Service morphed from
its original purpose -- combating counterfeiting -- to its major
mission today, protecting presidents and their families.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even as top figures became better protected, other targets in
that earlier era remained vulnerable. The Los Angeles Times was
bombed in 1910, leaving 20 dead, and a decade later, a bomb on Wall
Street killed scores.</TE>
<TE>   The public was eager for an anti-Red crackdown; in 1924, young J.
Edgar Hoover was hired to energize the sleepy Federal Bureau of
Investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians screamed, but the wave of terror subsided.
Today, Americans once again feel targeted, even if they're not sure
who's doing the targeting.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while speculation runs rampant, support for Uncle Sam's taking
strong action against terror, domestic as well as foreign, is
building. And action is coming, on both fronts.</TE>

<HD>White House Spins Out on an Axis of Evil</HD>
<DH>Use trade, aid and tourism against totalitarianism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Scheer</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer is a syndicated columnist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What a nuisance! Just as the Bush administration had Saddam Hussein
back in the cross hairs as the top target of the president's global
evil-eradication program comes the news of more urgent threats. And
once again, the bad news about Al Qaeda and North Korea could not be
logically connected in any way with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   First, CIA Director George J. Tenet issued a warning that Al Qaeda
posed as much of a danger to the U.S. as it did before the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. That's a bummer because, if true, it means that
the much-celebrated regime change in Afghanistan didn't even slow
down Osama bin Laden's gang of psychos. It is then doubly difficult
to make the case that a regime change in Iraq would make Americans
safer from Al Qaeda terrorism because there is not a shred of
reliable evidence linking that to Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   Both Tenet and Czech President Vaclav Havel have said that there
is no evidence that a much-publicized Prague meeting between Sept. 11
hijacker Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi agent ever happened.</LD>
<TE>   Now we learn, according to high-level Bush administration leaks to
the New York Times, that Pakistan has been colluding with North Korea
to the mutual benefit of their respective nuclear weapons programs.
Both countries are in violation of agreed-upon international
restraints, but in Pakistan's case the U.S. has lifted sanctions,
while it seeks to reimpose them on North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating things, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik
Aziz last week disavowed any Iraqi link to Al Qaeda: "We don't
condone religious fundamentalism, and therefore we don't have any
relationship with those people." We don't have to trust Aziz to know
his and Hussein's secular Baath Party has a huge stake in repressing
fundamentalism.</TE>
<TE>   This is an awkward irony, given that our Pakistani and Saudi
allies not only condone Muslim fundamentalism but, more important,
created its most virulent expression in the form of Bin Laden's
sponsors -- the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Why not engineer a regime change in North Korea and Pakistan
before getting around to Iraq, where functioning nuclear weapons,
according to our latest CIA intelligence, are only a gleam in
Hussein's eyes? For all the loose talk about Hussein's purported
chemical and biological weapons threat -- smallpox vaccine, anyone?
-- it is nuclear weapons, combined with the missile delivery systems
possessed by North Korea and Pakistan, that represent the most
serious threat of mass destruction. If launched on a city like New
Delhi or Seoul, even atomic bombs like the primitive ones we dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 57 years ago would be an unfathomable
atrocity.</TE>
<TE>   There are those, including some frustrated ex-doves, who when
faced with such an expanding enemies list throw up their hands and
say the heck with it, let's blast away at evil on all fronts. As with
the barroom brawler who will take up fisticuffs over any provocation,
this macho appeal allows one to avoid seeming weak -- except in the
head. Fortunately, however, cooler heads are beginning to perceive a
disaster in the making as we thrash about at any available target
with unreserved venom. That is why the Bush administration is already
backing off its first tough words about the treachery of North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that Pyongyang is a completely isolated junk-heap.
The government hopes desperately to follow Beijing's and Seoul's path
to an export-driven market economy. But it is diplomatically inept
and now just blurts out its worst behaviors -- kidnapping Japanese
civilians, building weapons of mass destruction -- in a desperate bid
for aid and recognition.</TE>
<TE>   It is thus best to think of North Korea as that bankrupt nation in
the Peter Sellers movie "The Mouse that Roared," based on the Leonard
Wibberly novel about a small nation that declares war on the U.S.,
planning to lose before a shot is fired and thus be eligible for
generous financial aid from the victor.</TE>
<TE>   And it might even work. Negotiations with the U.S. that were
sidetracked under the Bush administration will now begin in earnest.
The spigot of assistance from Japan and South Korea should be opened
enough to eventually allow North Korea to flood Wal-Mart and Costco
with cheap products built by a docile labor force.</TE>
<TE>   The hawks have got it wrong, for they have given up too easily on
the siren song of capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   Trade, aid, tourism and pirated Hollywood movies are the proven
weapons of mass destruction against totalitarianism, much more
effective than sanctions and war, which only enshrine dictators and
terrorists as the protectors of a people or nation's virtue. Inviting
it to the table is still the best weapon for stuffing a mouse that
roars.</TE>

<DH>As it was for Alice, life on the other side of the looking

<SE>A FAN'S DIARY / One in an occasional report during the World
Series.</SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For us fans, to watch the Angels in the World Series is to walk on
Mars, observe cold fusion, land in India with Columbus, or help
Schubert finish that symphony.</LD>
<LD>   So this is life on the other side of the looking glass.</LD>
<LD>   "This doesn't feel real," says Bobby Flores, a 28-year-old
corrections officer who watched Game 2 wearing an Angel cap with a
halo he fashioned out of a coat hanger and gold paper Christmas
ornaments.</LD>
<TE>   For 41 years, Angel fans were used to seeing the wheels fall off
their bandwagon short of the Series. Now, we are in a place we didn't
dare imagine, a country where all objects -- not just the roses --
have been painted Angel red. A place with no Thomas Guide.</TE>
<TE>   There is a power-mad monarch, name of Bonds. He apparently ate one
side of the mushroom and became so big that his hits no longer fit in
the park. There's our lovable Mouse, David Eckstein, who nibbled the
mushroom's other side and shrunk into the world's smallest shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   This adventure isn't free. A neighborhood parking lot off Katella
Avenue that costs $8 in the regular season is now $20. Scalpers all
grin like Cheshire Cats, as they rip off desperate fans with
counterfeit tickets at $400 per. (Memo to Anaheim police: Off with
their heads!) All around the stadium, Mad Hatters have set up shop,
getting $35 a lid.</TE>
<TE>   At this very important date, all this can be disorienting --
terribly, terribly disorienting.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season, Angel fans lived in a small kingdom, hidden in
the Southern California grid. Angel Land had few big crowds and
little traffic. There wasn't always good baseball, but the Big A
offered a refuge from the urban curses of cynicism and irony.</TE>
<TE>   It was not a place to be seen. If you were on the run from the
law, Anaheim's stadium in fall -- the crowd dwindling, the outfield
grass dying -- would have been a smart place to hide.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend, in the name of security, the place was crawling with
more federal agents than a WorldCom shareholders meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The stands were full of Hollywood actors, most on descent from the
A to the B list, who took seats from fans for a few seconds of
network TV time. The Fox network provided box seats to the casts of
new shows that will be canceled by spring training. From the cheap
seats, you could spot them by their hair, striking shades of yellow
and orange not found in nature.</TE>
<TE>   Judging by the crowd shots on the giant screen, you have to play
for the Lakers to afford the best seats. Don Bainum, 33, a sales VP
and lifelong fan, spent five innings searching for a way in Sunday
before the Angels finally released those tickets that hadn't been
picked up at will call. He paid $175 to see the final four frames.
(Thanks to the anonymous donor who found me an upper-deck ticket at
the $110 face value).</TE>
<TE>   The resulting crowd was quieter than it had been for earlier
playoff rounds.</TE>
<TE>   In this Series, Angel fans find themselves sharing their once ugly
duckling with the world. You know, the child who lived too long at
home, the one who tried to walk out the door but never got past the
front porch. She left home this year and wound up a cover girl.</TE>
<TE>   We're thrilled for her, proud to find ourselves walking into a
ballpark under a sign that says "Welcome to the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just our tea party anymore.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder if there aren't a few Giant fans who feel the same way,
having wrapped themselves in blankets for extra innings at
Candlestick Park and now unable to find standing room at the team's
new downtown palace.</TE>
<TE>   California creates great fortunes, gobbles up land and swallows
people of all kinds. There are few quiet successes here. The
celebrity rabbit hole ushers in a new product every 10 minutes, and
the Angels are far more worthy than most.</TE>
<TE>   So, Angel fans, rejoice at finding yourself under the bright
lights of Wonderland.</TE>
<TE>   But a discovery, by definition, happens only once. And in the
triumph of reaching the Series, another sweet sliver of uncharted
territory is lost.</TE>

<HD>Doctors: Baby Should Be Taken Off Support</HD>
<DH>The father of the comatose 1-year-old faces abuse charges,
which could become a murder count if the child dies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two doctors testified Monday that an Orange County boy will never
recover from brain injuries allegedly inflicted by his father in a
violent shaking and said they believe he should be removed from life
support. The testimony came at the opening of a hearing on the fate
of 1-year-old Christopher Ibarra, who has been in a coma and on life
support from the day he was carried into an emergency room 10 months
ago.</LD>
<LD>   The boy's mother, Tamara Sepulveda, has been fighting for months
to have her son removed from the ventilator that pumps oxygen into
his lungs, saying that she wants to end his suffering and "let him go
to heaven."</LD>
<LD>   Christopher's father, Moises Ibarra, who faces child abuse charges
and is being held in Orange County Jail, opposes the efforts, arguing
that he wants to preserve the boy's life while he hopes for a
miracle. Tamara Sepulveda has said she believes the father has an
ulterior motive: If the boy dies, Ibarra probably will be charged
with murder.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Richard Behn is attempting to resolve the
matter. The first two witnesses were doctors from Children's Hospital
of Orange County. They testified that they believe Christopher will
never wake from his coma and would almost certainly die if removed
from life-support machines.</TE>
<TE>   "He won't have [a] meaningful life. This is the way Christopher
will be," said Dr. David Hicks, who testified after visiting
Christopher at a long-term care hospital in Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   As the doctor spoke, Christopher's grandmother, Susan Sepulveda,
wiped tears from her eyes. At the hearing, the boy's parents sat
about eight feet apart but did not look at each other.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher's father has pleaded not guilty to felony child abuse
and is awaiting trial.</TE>
<TE>   Outside court, Tamara Sepulveda said she has stopped visiting her
son because she can't stand the emotional pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hurt inside.... Any parent would be," she said. "It's tough
on me to see my son like this."</TE>

<HD>Official Rejects Proposal to Raze Bowling Alley</HD>
<DH>Planning officer finds no need for a storage facility
planned for the Eagle Rock site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles planning officer on Monday rejected a plan to tear down
a bowling alley in Eagle Rock and replace it with a self-storage
business, saying that proponents had not convinced him that another
self-serve storage business was needed in the area.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by associate zoning administrator Daniel Green came
after a two-hour City Hall hearing during which opponents said there
are 37 self-storage businesses within a five-mile radius of the All
Star Lanes bowling alley on Eagle Rock Boulevard, which has been in
business there since 1960.</LD>
<LD>   Within that same distance, they said, there was only one other
bowling alley.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm ecstatic with the decision," said one Eagle Rock resident,
Manuel Montano, 39, who argued that All Star Lanes -- where he has
bowled since he was a teenager -- was an important recreation outlet
in the community.</TE>
<TE>   Members of several community groups, including the Eagle Rock
Assn., the Glassell Park Improvement Assn. and the Historic Highland
Park Neighborhood Council, said they opposed the storage proposal.
Representatives for Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles) and
area Councilman Nick Pacheco said the lawmakers also opposed it.</TE>
<TE>   The project's architect, Bruce Jordan, questioned the figure of 37
storage businesses. "Not all of them fit the definition of a
self-storage business," he said. He said there is a demonstrated need
for a new storage business.</TE>
<TE>   The bowling alley's owner since 1980, Said Simantob, argued that
the bowling alley has been losing money since the mid-1990s and that
the $2.2-million offer for the site by Extra Space Storage of Salt
Lake City was the only viable one for the property.</TE>
<TE>   The offer "was enough for us to kiss it good-bye," Simantob said
at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Several nearby residents favored the bowling alley's demolition,
citing a variety of late-night trouble: loud patrons, public
urination, late-night skateboarding, fighting and the foul odor from
the bowling alley's trash cans.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a weekend that I get a complete night of sleep," said
Donna Campbell, a resident manager of the nearby Villa Piedra senior
citizens apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters said they had collected the signatures of about 100
area residents, who favored demolition.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, however, said they had petitions with nearly 1,700
signatures. They rallied earlier in the day at the bowling alley,
saying that it represented an important part of Eagle Rock's diverse
community.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard about it about a month ago and my immediate reaction was
to throw up my hands and say, 'No way,' " Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   Even the co-owner of a Montessori pre-school and elementary
school, Noeline Shanmugan, stopped by for a few minutes to support
the bowling alley's survival.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage it to stay here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In rendering his decision, Green said he could not grant a
conditional-use permit for a new three-story structure, noting that
zoning in the northeast area allows buildings no higher than two
stories -- 30 feet in height.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently swayed by the over-saturation argument, Green concluded
that supporters had "not presented a convincing case for a need" for
a new storage building.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, the architect, said Simantob and others would consider
their options before deciding whether to appeal. They have four weeks
to appeal.</TE>

<LD>A candidate in last year's school board election in Hawthorne pleaded
no contest Monday to misdemeanor charges of petty theft and stealing
a rival candidate's campaign signs.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said Hugo Rojas, 33, a former head of the city's youth
commission, entered the pleas before Superior Court Judge David
Wesley, who sentenced him to five days in county jail, two years'
probation, 100 hours of community service and a $100 fine. Rojas was
accused of hiring four students between the ages of 12 and 16 to
steal yard signs belonging to Nilo Michelin, who won election over
Rojas.</LD>

<LD>The J. Paul Getty Trust, long rebuffed in its efforts to add an
amphitheater to its now-closed Pacific Palisades villa, won a key
battle in state appellate court against traffic-wary residential
neighbors Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel overturned the 2000 decision by Superior Court
Judge Dzintra Janavs, who held that the Los Angeles City Council had
improperly approved the Getty's plans for a 450-seat theater by
overriding zoning restrictions and the protests of neighbors. Now "we
will proceed full speed ahead," said Peter Erichsen, vice president
and general counsel to the J. Paul Getty Trust.</LD>

<HD>7 Vying for Secretary of State Agree on Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to replacing antiquated punch-balloting systems,
improving voter turnout and fuller disclosure of campaign financing,
all seven candidates for secretary of state agree.</LD>
<LD>   In a debate before a sparse crowd at Cal State Fullerton, the
candidates expressed surprise last week to find themselves on the
same side of several issues related to voter registration and
elections.</LD>
<LD>   Five candidates also said at Friday's forum that they support
Proposition 52 on the Nov. 5 ballot, which would allow voters to
register up to the day of the election. "We have a crisis in our
democracy," said Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco). He
wrote several election-reform bills signed by Gov. Gray Davis,
including one allowing people to apply to be permanent absentee
voters.</LD>
<TE>   Republican Keith Olberg, a former Assembly member, and Edward
Noonan of the American Independent Party oppose Proposition 52.
Olberg said he supports same-day voting in principle but not the
ballot measure because it doesn't properly deal with potential voter
fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley countered that other states have allowed same-day
registration without a jump in fraud while simultaneously boosting
turnout.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates backing Proposition 52 are Louise Marie Allison
of the Natural Law Party, Libertarian Gail K. Lightfoot, Valli
Sharpe-Geisler of the Reform Party and Larry Shoup of the Green
Party. All seven candidates also applauded plans for electronic
voting to replace punch-card ballots by 2004, provided that there is
a "paper trail" backup. Several also were open to the idea of
Internet voting.</TE>
<TE>   Allison, the Natural Law candidate, suggested that Oregon's
process of voting by mail was one way to improve participation in
California, where only a quarter of registered voters cast ballots in
March. Shoup, the Green candidate, supported "instant runoff"
ballots, on which voters would rank their choices, with secondary
votes counted in case one candidate failed to receive a majority.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates agreed that voting could occur over several days
to give people more time to cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley said state money is available to improve voting systems
through a measure he wrote that passed in March. Federal funds also
have been authorized in a bill on its way to President Bush. The
money should be spent not only on equipment but also on making sure
poll workers are trained, Shelley said.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates also agreed that little attention had been paid to
their race and that, without much money, most have had few
opportunities to get their message to voters. The exception is
Shelley, the Assembly majority leader who has raised nearly $2
million and had $1.1 million left as of Sept. 30. Olberg has raised
about $620,000 this year and has about that amount in cash on hand.</TE>

<HD>Deputy's Trial Set in Filing of False Reports</HD>
<DH>Accused of fabricating drug charges against a man, he is
scheduled to appear in court Oct. 28.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy indicted by a grand jury on
allegations that he fabricated drug charges that sent a man to prison
for four years will go on trial next week, a Los Angeles County
Superior Court judge said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Sean O'Donoghue, 36, has pleaded not guilty to seven felony counts
of allegedly framing a man with possession of heroin and cocaine to
cover up for a female informant who had thrown a bag of drugs on a
Compton roof during a June 2001 raid. The informant, testifying
before the grand jury, said O'Donoghue had asked her to ensure that
drugs were on the premises during the raid, which was aimed at
arresting a drug dealer who lived there.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, O'Donoghue, who has been suspended without pay, was
ordered to return for trial on Oct. 28.</LD>
<TE>   Vicki Podberesky, O'Donoghue's attorney, said her client has
garnered more than 10 commendations during a 14-year career as a
deputy. "He has an unblemished personnel file except for a traffic
accident," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The case, Podberesky said, boils down to "who threw the dope on
the roof."</TE>
<TE>   At a grand jury session in May, the informant, Leticia Villa,
testified that she was a drug runner who agreed to an arrangement
with O'Donoghue to set up a drug dealer she worked for.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donoghue and several deputies from the sheriff's Compton
narcotics squad on June 26, 2001, raided two homes in the 12800 block
of Harris Avenue. As the deputies entered the houses with guns drawn,
Villa testified, she was unprepared and decided to throw the drugs on
the roof so that it wasn't "too obvious" to fellow participants in
the drug operation.</TE>
<TE>   However, Deputy April Carter told the grand jury that she was
standing alongside O'Donoghue during the raid and saw Villa hurl the
drugs. "She tossed the dope," Carter testified that she screamed to
her colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Villa, who has four felony drug-related convictions, told grand
jurors she informed O'Donoghue moments later when they were alone
that the "lady deputy had seen me throw it."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, she testified, O'Donoghue assured her that she need
not worry because another resident of the house -- not the initial
target of the raid -- was "going to take the rap." O'Donoghue filed a
police report alleging that it was Reyes Cardenas who had the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   County prosecutors allege that O'Donoghue falsified the report and
a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Cardenas faced the possibility of 13 years in
state prison. In August 2001, Cardenas pleaded no contest to drug
possession. He told the grand jury in May that he had "felt
pressured" to enter the plea for a four-year prison term because of
the lengthy sentence he could have received if he had gone to trial.
He was released in May from a Norco prison after prosecutors
dismissed his case following a sheriff's investigation into his
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "Sean O'Donoghue falsified the police report," said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Dan Baker, who is prosecuting the case.</TE>
<TE>   Baker said two others -- one of them a deputy -- heard Carter
scream that the woman had thrown the drugs on the roof of the house.</TE>
<TE>   "The man convicted is not the person seen throwing the dope on the
roof," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department probe began after a person who lived in
one of the two homes alleged that $3,000 was missing from a backpack
confiscated by sheriff's deputies at the scene. During their
investigation, they uncovered the alleged fabrication by O'Donoghue.</TE>
<TE>   O'Donoghue faces a maximum three years and eight months in prison
if convicted of the crimes, which include perjury, filing a false
police report and false imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   Carter told grand jurors that she had not known who was arrested
in the incident until questioned months later by internal affairs
investigators. She said deputies who had been at the scene later met
twice to discuss the case.</TE>

<HD>More Told in Teen's Killing</HD>
<DH>A fourth man is sought in the slaying of a Northern
California boy who lived as a girl. A witness describes a drunken
party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christine Hanley and Jessica Garrison</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Authorities are seeking a fourth man in the killing of a 17-year-old
boy who lived as a girl until companions discovered his gender at the
end of a drunken evening, allegedly strangling the teen they knew as
Lida.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a Jason," said Alameda County Deputy Dist. Atty.
Theodore T. Landswick. "We will find him."</LD>
<LD>   Two witnesses told police a man named Jason attended the Oct. 3
party that ended with the death of Eddie Araujo. Authorities would
not confirm Jason's last name, which appears in police reports. "All
I know is our detectives are acting on a tip about a fourth subject
who may be involved in this," said Lt. Tom Milner of the Newark
Police Department.</LD>
<TE>   Three men are being held without bail in the case: Michael
Magidson, 22, of Fremont, and Jaron Chase Nabors, 19, and Jose Merel,
24, both of Newark. They are to be arraigned Thursday on murder
charges in the death of Araujo, who disappeared from a party at
Merel's house. Nabors led police to Araujo's shallow grave in the El
Dorado National Forest on Wednesday, according to authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo had been dressing as a girl for about three years, going by
the names Gwen and Lida. About two months ago, friends said, he began
visiting the Merel house with Merel, Magidson and Nabors.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Brown, a friend of Paul Merel, Jose's older brother,
described in an interview with The Times what happened the night
Araujo died. The evening began, she said, with an impromptu gathering
that unfolded in a haze of cigarette smoke and beer.</TE>
<TE>   As the group sat around a table to play dominoes and drink, Brown
said, she and her friends still believed Araujo was a girl. But a
fight between Brown and Araujo at the Merel house a few weeks
earlier, she said, had raised doubts.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, 21, who said she had never lost a fight with another girl,
said Araujo surprised her with a powerful blow after Brown challenged
Araujo to take off her shirt and perform a striptease for the men who
were gathered there.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said she urged Araujo to strip until the two began fighting.
The men tried to pull them apart as Brown and Araujo exchanged
punches and pulled each other's hair. "They were tripping, because
she was smaller than me and just as strong," Brown said. "She fought
like a guy."</TE>
<TE>   Brown and Araujo made up after the fight, Brown said, and the
night of Oct. 3 began amicably, with lots of chatting and two trips
to a 7-Eleven to buy beer and cigarettes. On one of those trips,
Brown said, Araujo confided she had crushes on both Magidson and
Nabors.</TE>
<TE>   Those two were out at a nightclub along with Jose Merel and the
man whom Brown said she knows only as Jason. All four showed at up
the Merel house after midnight, she said, and joined the party.</TE>
<TE>   About 3:30 a.m., Brown and Paul Merel were about to go to sleep
when Brown heard tense voices from the other room. Brown said that
when she walked into the kitchen, she saw the men confronting Araujo.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you a man?" Brown recalled them saying. "Are you a man?"</TE>
<TE>   Araujo did not respond. Brown said she called out: "Why don't one
of you guys find out?"</TE>
<TE>   Magidson then accompanied Araujo to the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   While the two were gone, Brown said, the others told her some of
them had had sex with Lida. Brown said she tried to reassure the men
that Araujo "was definitely a woman."</TE>
<TE>   After half an hour, Magidson and Araujo were still in the
bathroom, so Brown said she decided to go in. Araujo was sitting on
the sink and appeared to be very drunk. He didn't answer Brown's
questions. "I opened her legs," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Brown recalled screaming: "It's a man! Oh my God!"</TE>
<TE>   Jose Merel began sobbing, Brown said, and stayed near the
bathroom. Magidson, Nabors and Jason went outside to smoke
cigarettes.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said she began pleading with Jose Merel to let the evening
end peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Let her go. Let her walk out that door,' " Brown
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Then Brown said she turned to Araujo and told him, "You better run
as fast as you can."</TE>
<TE>   Araujo left the bathroom and headed toward the front door, Brown
said. Moments later he was back, followed by Magidson, Nabors and
Jason.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors later told police he had prevented Araujo from leaving the
house, according to court records. Magidson then grabbed Araujo and
wrestled him to the ground, Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was lying on top of her, talking to her," Brown said, adding
that she could not hear what he was saying.</TE>
<TE>   "When I knew at that point they were so angry I couldn't stop it,
that's when I left," she said. "I know Paul and Jose, and I know they
wouldn't do anything. But I didn't know those other guys that well. I
was scared."</TE>
<TE>   She ran back into Paul Merel's room and got him up to leave. She
said that because he is on probation, he did not want to be involved
in any trouble. She was also afraid, she said, because she has two
children of her own. The two left to drive the 25 miles to Brown's
apartment in Livermore, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say they are still trying to find out exactly what
happened next.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors told police Araujo was beaten, then Jose Merel and Magidson
dragged Araujo into the garage, tied a rope around his neck and
strangled him. Then they wrapped Araujo's body, put him in the back
of Magidson's truck and drove 150 miles to the Sierra Nevada to bury
him, according to Nabors' statement to police.</TE>
<TE>   Merel's mother, Wanda, said her son told her he had nothing to do
with the killing and was willing to take a lie detector test.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said that the day after the party, she asked Paul Merel what
had happened. She recalled that he told her his brother said: "Let's
just say she had a long walk home."</TE>

<HD>Methane Tests Faked, D.A. Says</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach duped by firm that submitted phony reports
of gas levels falling under a library and park, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company hired by Huntington Beach to monitor potentially dangerous
methane gas under a park and a library repeatedly faked the data to
make it appear the gas levels were declining, prosecutors charged
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   GeoScience Analytical Inc. of Simi Valley, and its president,
Fleet E. Rust, face criminal charges of submitting false field test
data to government officials. If convicted, Rust could be sentenced
to two years in prison and fined $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to send a message to labs that they certainly aren't
going to get away with that kind of conduct in this county," said
Nick Thompson, an Orange County deputy district attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Rust could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach hired GeoScience Analytical several years ago to
test methane levels at Edison Community Park and Huntington Beach
Central Library, which are built atop landfills. Decaying waste
creates methane, a colorless, odorless gas that is highly explosive.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed regular reports to the Orange County Health Care
Agency's Solid Waste Enforcement unit. However, officials with the
agency became suspicious this year when methane levels appeared to be
rapidly dropping. A county inspector went to the sites and saw
monitoring wells covered in cobwebs, debris and dirt.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office sealed the monitoring sites. To
test the wells, the company would have had to break the seals. But
the seals remained intact, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office set up surveillance of the sites,
and concluded that no one was monitoring methane levels. Yet the

<HD>Huntington Methane Tests Faked, D.A. Says</HD>
<DH>Company charged with filing phony results to show declining
gas levels under two city sites.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A company hired by Huntington Beach to monitor potentially dangerous
methane gas under a park and a library repeatedly faked the data to
make it appear the gas levels were declining, prosecutors charged
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   GeoScience Analytical Inc. of Simi Valley, and its president Fleet
E. Rust, face criminal charges of submitting false field test data to
government officials. If convicted, Rust could be sentenced to two
years in prison and $50,000 in fines.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to send a message to labs that they certainly aren't
going to get away with that kind of conduct in this county," said
Nick Thompson, an Orange County deputy district attorney.</LD>
<TE>   Rust could not be reached for comment Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach hired GeoScience Analytical several years ago to
test methane levels at Edison Community Park and Huntington Beach
Central Library, which are built atop closed landfills. Decaying
waste creates methane, a colorless, odorless gas that is highly
explosive.</TE>
<TE>   The company filed regular reports to the Orange County Health Care
Agency's Solid Waste Enforcement unit.</TE>
<TE>   However, officials with the agency became suspicious this year
when methane levels appeared to be rapidly dropping. A county
inspector went to the sites and saw monitoring wells covered in
cobwebs, debris and dirt that had not been disturbed in some time.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office also sealed the monitoring sites.
To test the wells, the company would have had to break the seals. But
the seals remained intact, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The county district attorney's office set up surveillance of the
sites, and concluded that no one was monitoring methane levels. Yet
the GeoScience Analytical reports kept coming in, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as the city learned of the false reports, it tested the
park and the library, as well as 29 homes and a nearby school. These
tests found that there is no threat to the public but found that
levels were not dropping as GeoScience had claimed, Huntington Beach
Fire Chief Mike Dolder said.</TE>
<TE>   Dolder said he felt "absolutely shocked" by the revelation. "It
was disbelief initially," he said. "Then we focused, and said let's
get in there and make sure the neighborhood's safe."</TE>
<TE>   Arraignment is scheduled Nov. 12, Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to criminal sanctions, prosecutors are seeking more
than $30,000 to compensate Huntington Beach for monitoring that was
conducted after city officials learned of the false reports.</TE>
<TE>   The company also has conducted environmental testing at the
Belmont Learning Center, an old dump beneath the Oxnard Dunes and
abandoned oil fields in Santa Fe Springs, Los Angeles, Huntington
Beach, Newport Beach and Brea.</TE>
<TE>   Methane is not toxic when inhaled, but it can cause suffocation by
reducing the concentration of oxygen in enclosed places. It is highly
flammable, and levels of 5% to 15% in air are explosive.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson said the lack of monitoring could have proved dangerous
had the methane built up.</TE>
<TE>   "If it had gone undetected for a period of months, there could
have been significant risk," he said.</TE>

<HD>Police Cover-Up Alleged in Shooting of Girl, 14</HD>
<DH>Lawyers for foster child charged with assaulting an officer
contend the officer wasn't in danger.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 14-year-old foster child was threatening only herself in May when
Ventura police found her holding a knife and critically wounded her
with gunshots to the stomach, her lawyers and father said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Kristin Rupp, who shot the girl, has been cleared of
wrongdoing. The girl's trial on one felony count of assaulting an
officer with a deadly weapon -- a kitchen knife with an 8-inch blade
-- is scheduled to begin next week in Juvenile Court.</LD>
<LD>   Attorneys for the girl, who is identified in court documents as
Anna G., held a news conference Monday to rally public support for
her defense. They said the girl is innocent and police are accusing
her to cover up a rookie officer's mistake. "We believe that the
crime didn't occur until after the police thought about it awhile,"
said lawyer David Brockway of Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The case has drawn the attention of Chinese reporters, who were at
the news conference, because the girl was born in China and her
father is Chinese. Her mother was last known to be in China, the
prosecutor said. Anna has recovered from her injuries and is
currently in Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   She had been living in foster homes because she and her father
fought about a boyfriend he did not approve of, her father said.
Court records show that the father was convicted last year of
corporal injury to a child. Brockway confirmed that the child is Anna
and that she was taken out of his care.</TE>
<TE>   When Anna threatened to kill herself at her Ventura foster home
the night of May 5, her foster parents called police. Officers found
the girl holding a knife, said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Miles Weiss.
Anna ignored officers' repeated demands to drop the knife and when
she advanced toward Rupp, the 23-year-old officer shot her in the
abdomen, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, who speaks and understands English, had "ample
opportunity" to comply with officers, Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "She never dropped the knife until after she was shot" and fell to
the kitchen floor, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Her lawyers and father dispute that account, saying she let go of
the knife once she saw the officers and never intended to harm
police. Her father said the police should have tried another way to
control the emotionally troubled girl, suggesting pepper spray or a
stun gun.</TE>
<TE>   Anna spent eight days at Ventura County Medical Center, recovering
from her wounds. If found guilty, the girl faces a maximum of four
years in custody. But Weiss said she would probably enter a treatment
program for juvenile criminals instead.</TE>

<HD>Body Identified as Missing Teenager</HD>
<DH>Brenda Sierra was last seen Friday morning. Authorities are
investigating her death.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John L. Mitchell and Daniel Hernandez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A body found in the San Bernardino mountains was identified Monday as
that of a 15-year-old East Los Angeles girl who disappeared three
days earlier after she left home for a friend's house.</LD>
<LD>   Family members of Brenda Sierra had been going door to door
circulating fliers with her picture when they received the news about
the body found Saturday in a community known as the Valley of
Enchantment near Crestline.</LD>
<LD>   Chip Patterson, a spokesman for the San Bernardino County
Sheriff's Department, said, "We didn't know who she was until our
detectives found out about the missing girl in Los Angeles County."</LD>
<TE>   The body was hidden among trees and there were injuries, he said,
but he would not specify what they were.</TE>
<TE>   Bud Davis, a 72-year-old retired construction worker, said he was
cutting wood not far from his home when his dog "ran over in the
trees and wouldn't come back. We thought it was a coyote or bear. I
went over there and there she was, fully clothed. Looked like someone
had kicked dirt over the body." Davis said "it looked like she had
been dragged there."</TE>
<TE>   Sierra had left her house on South Leonard Avenue at 7 a.m. Friday
for a friend's house a few blocks away and a ride to Schurr High
School in Montebello, where she was a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   "She walks to my house every single day, every day," Ashley
Salgado said earlier Monday. "She gets there around 7:15, 7:20, you
know. Then my mom honks the horn and we leave for school, every
single day."</TE>
<TE>   Salgado said she and her mother assumed Sierra was sick when she
did not arrive. But family members became alarmed when she failed to
show up for an appointment at a hair salon after school. Sheriff's
deputies were called by 6 p.m., but they didn't arrive until 10 p.m.,
Sierra's brother Jaime said.</TE>
<TE>   The deputies cautioned family members that she might have run
away, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But relatives insisted that Sierra never left home without saying
where she was going.</TE>
<TE>   "She was just a caring, loving person," said her 14-year-old
brother, Rafael Sierra. "She would call my parents whenever she went
out."</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death is under investigation by the San Bernardino
County coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   The homicide is being investigated jointly by San Bernardino and
Los Angeles county sheriff's detectives, Patterson said.</TE>
<TE>   Family and friends had spent the weekend searching the streets for
Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, outside the stucco house she shared with her parents
and four siblings, a small shrine grew as neighbors brought candles
and flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, Sierra's best friend since the fifth grade, said her
fondest memory was of Sierra's quinceanera last summer at a hotel in
Commerce with her friends and family. That night, the girls shared a
room at the hotel, Salgado said, and "she was so happy. We talked
about it all night.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep thinking it's all a dream, and tomorrow I'm going to wake
up and she's going to come to my house skipping," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Yoana Manzano, another friend, remembered Monday night how Sierra,
who did well in math and science, would ask Manzano if she had done
her homework. Sierra, she said, always had done her own.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra's oldest brother, Jaime, 23, said the family is "mourning
right now. Mad, angry, whatever. Right now, were just sad for her."</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Simon Woos Farmers</HD>
<DH>The GOP candidate campaigns in Central Valley as growers'
group endorses him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matea Gold and Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>STOCKTON</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. trundled by bus
through California's farmland Monday, touting an endorsement from an
influential farm organization as he accused Gov. Gray Davis of
ignoring the needs of the state's agriculture industry.</LD>
<LD>   "We would be an impoverished state, in so many ways, without our
farmers," Simon said at an early morning news conference in the musty
warehouse of a Bakersfield tractor dealership.</LD>
<LD>   "And that's why it saddens me -- in fact, it angers me -- to see
Gray Davis continually neglect the needs of our farmers, trample on
their private property rights, stand in the way of their success," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking in front of two green John Deere tractors, the GOP
candidate seeking Davis' job said "the last straw" for growers was
the governor's decision to sign a new measure mandating arbitration
between farm workers and their employers when negotiations stall. He
also said increases in workers' compensation payments and stringent
state regulations harm farmers.</TE>
<TE>   "Far from helping California's struggling agricultural economy,
he's actually stepped on you while you're down," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Farm Bureau Federation, representing 95,000
members, announced its endorsement of Simon on Monday -- a decision
that its president said had been strengthened by Davis' decision to
sign the arbitration measure.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, campaigning in Chico and Eureka, brushed aside Simon's
criticism. He said he understood that farmers were upset that he had
signed the law. But, he said, farmers have benefited from the state's
"Buy California" campaign and the agricultural tax breaks he approved
last year, which he said had reduced the tax burden on farmers to the
lowest level in 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to get in a back-and-forth with Mr. Simon -- he's
thrown a lot of bombs that have exploded in his face so I don't
attach much credibility to his commentary," Davis told reporters in
Chico. "I am proud of our efforts to move everyone forward."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's four-city Central Valley bus trip -- with stops in
Bakersfield, Tulare, Fresno and Stockton -- took him through a region
where polls show he already has strong support. At each stop, groups
of several dozen cheering backers greeted the candidate. Simon and
his allies asked the crowds to spread their enthusiasm to other
voters by election day, Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the right kind of voter turnout, without participation up
and down the valley, Bill Simon cannot win," said Bill Pauli,
president of the state farm bureau federation, during a visit to the
Farmington Fresh packing company in Stockton at the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Pauli traveled with Simon on Monday to announce the endorsement,
which he said had come about because state rules about water
diversion and air quality, along with workers' compensation
increases, have helped create "an economic crisis" in the agriculture
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands the problems that we face in agriculture, the
crisis that we all face in both production and processing, the
challenges we have to meet the bottom line to stay in business,"
Pauli said.</TE>
<TE>   Pauli added that the Farm Bureau would send out targeted mailers
and mobilize voters to vote for Simon, much as the United Farm
Workers plans to press for Davis' election.</TE>
<TE>   As the sun rose over Bakersfield, Simon's campaign bus -- a
refurbished city bus from Columbus, Ohio, that runs on natural gas --
rolled north past acres of grapevines, almond groves and dusty hay
fields. Several trucks zooming by on Interstate 99 honked their horns
loudly in support as they passed the large "Bill Simon for Governor"
banner on the side of the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In Tulare, Simon toured a collection of antique farm equipment at
Heritage Complex of the International Agri-Center. He and his wife
Cindy clambered on top of a red tractor built in 1953, smiling and
waving to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   At the Fresno Farm Bureau, Simon broke from the agriculture theme
of the day to read portions of an Oct. 17 letter to Davis from state
schools Supt. Delaine Eastin, a Democrat who has been at odds with
the governor. In the two-page letter, Eastin chastised the governor
for vetoing a bill that would have allowed the state to take over the
West Fresno Elementary School District. She called the district's
governing board "dysfunctional" and said the district is facing
insolvency because of staggering debt.</TE>
<TE>   "By vetoing this bill, you have sentenced these disillusioned
children and their desperate parents to more educational and
emotional hardship," she wrote, adding later, "Now what?"</TE>
<TE>   "The 'now what' is to vote Gray Davis out of office," Simon told
about 40 people at the farm bureau, drawing applause and cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when asked if he would have signed the measure, Simon
initially equivocated, saying that he would have "looked at it very
closely." On the campaign bus a few minutes later, he told reporters
he would have signed it.</TE>
<TE>   Davis spokesman Roger Salazar, in response, cited Davis' veto
message on the measure. In it, Davis wrote that, although he
understood the problems in the district, he was worried that a bad
precedent would be created if the state took control of the schools
before the district was insolvent.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Davis spent the day among his partisans, campaigning
with organized labor officials and workers as he argued that Simon's
election would roll back gains they have made since his inauguration.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about whether you care enough about your future, that you
want to get out over the next 15 days and tell people, 'Well, maybe I
won't give [Davis] four stars, but he's working hard. He's a lot
better than the opposition,' " Davis said, during the final day of a
two-day blitz across the state meant to fire up his Democratic base.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was joined by his wife, Sharon, and Art Pulaski, leader of
the California Labor Federation, at a Monday afternoon rally with
workers, students and other Democratic supporters at Cal State Chico.
He traveled later to Eureka for a rally with union members and other
Democratic activists, landing at the airport in a thick fog.</TE>
<TE>   In Chico, Davis spoke outside a $12-million building under
construction at the university -- a project begun during his
administration.</TE>
<TE>   The building will include new classrooms, laboratories, lecture
halls and faculty offices for the university's Department of Physical
Education and Exercise Science and Department of Recreation and Parks
management.</TE>
<TE>   After spending the last two days with farm workers and their
leaders, Davis turned to urban unions for logistical and moral
support in his Northern California swing. Many in the crowd at Chico
were carpenters and construction workers in hard hats.</TE>

<HD>Huntington Park Councilwoman Guilty of Perjury</HD>
<DH>The two-term official will be allowed to serve until she is
sentenced for lying about residency.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Huntington Park Councilwoman Linda Luz Guevara was convicted Monday
on four felony counts for lying about her residency -- claiming to
live in Huntington Park when she really lives in Downey.</LD>
<LD>   Guevara testified that she sleeps on an air mattress in her
mother's living room in Huntington Park, but a jury took three hours
to determine that her true residence is a house in Downey that she
shares with her husband and son.</LD>
<LD>   A two-term councilwoman, Guevara faces a potential four-year
prison term but could receive probation at her sentencing hearing
scheduled Nov. 14.</LD>
<TE>   Guevara showed no emotion as the court clerk read the verdict, but
her husband, sitting in the nearly empty downtown Los Angeles
courtroom, broke down crying, muttering "Oh my God" between sobs.</TE>
<TE>   Guevara's conviction marks the first time an elected official
might be ousted from office by Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley's public
integrity unit. Prosecutors said Guevara can serve until the judge
issues a sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, an elected official convicted of perjury cannot
hold office. Guevara was convicted on two counts each of perjury and
filing false declarations of candidacy. "We're hoping to send a
message to candidates and politicians who lie about their residency,"
said David Demerjian, who heads the public integrity unit.</TE>
<TE>   Two others have been convicted of similar charges, including a
former Compton school board member who pleaded guilty this month and
a former South Gate City Council candidate who was convicted on seven
felony counts earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Guevara, a 45-year-old paralegal, declined to comment as she left
the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   At the two-week trial, testimony centered on where Guevara's real
residence was when she filed candidacy papers in the 1997 and 1999
elections.</TE>
<TE>   According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Goodwin, Guevara testified
that she lived during the week in Huntington Park with her mother and
brother in a three-bedroom home. On weekends, Guevara said, she lived
in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   When investigators launched early-morning raids at both homes in
May 2001, they found Guevara at the Downey residence. During
surveillance of Guevara's daily routine, they also saw Guevara return
regularly to the Downey residence.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors appeared most swayed by testimony from several longtime
neighbors of Guevara's mother, who said they rarely saw the
councilwoman there. Jurors also said they discounted several of
Guevara's witnesses, who said she lived in Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt they weren't being honest about her pattern of living,"
said one juror, who asked not to be identified.</TE>

<HD>Ventura County to Consider Accepting Mexican-Issued IDs</HD>
<DH>Supervisors will debate whether immigrants can use the
cards as official identification. Los Angeles is using them on a
trial basis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Catherine Saillant</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors today will consider allowing Mexican
immigrants -- legal or illegal -- to use a Mexican identification
card to do business at county offices.</LD>
<LD>   The state of California and a handful of local governments have
begun accepting the card, a matricula consular, as valid ID, said
Supervisor John Flynn, who will ask his colleagues on the Board of
Supervisors to do the same.</LD>
<LD>   Acceptance of the card would allow Mexican nationals residing here
to obtain marriage certificates, business licenses, senior discounts
and library cards, the supervisor said.</LD>
<TE>   It also would encourage undocumented immigrants to report crimes
and cooperate with police, Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Many fear being detained by law enforcement because they lack
proper ID, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He stressed that illegal immigrants could not use the cards to
obtain government benefits or to alter their legal status.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it confer driving privileges to undocumented motorists, a
controversial benefit sought by legislation that was vetoed by Gov.
Gray Davis last month.</TE>
<TE>   "This will make the lives of people living here more comfortable,"
said Flynn, whose Oxnard-based district includes the county's largest
immigrant population. "It should not be controversial at all."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of immigration control, however, say that if Ventura
County agrees to accept the card as valid ID, it will legitimize
people who have broken laws to enter the country.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are in the country legally have documentation, so the
only people who need these cards are illegal aliens," said David Ray,
spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Federation for American
Immigration Reform, an immigration watchdog group. "They should be
accepted by government offices only as a one-way bus pass back to the
border."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a critic of illegal
immigration, called Flynn's proposal absurd.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a quasi-amnesty, and I disagree with that," Gallegly said.
"We are a country of immigrants. But we are also a country of laws.
And we are seeing a tremendous backlash to immigration overall as a
result of illegal immigration."</TE>
<TE>   With the nation focused on rooting out terrorism here and abroad,
the matricula provides another avenue for terrorists to claim they
are legally in the country, the congressman said.</TE>
<TE>   "This document is issued by a foreign government," he said. "We
don't have any control over who gets them and the legitimacy of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Consul Fernando Gamboa, of the Oxnard consulate, asked
Flynn to bring the proposal to the board. San Francisco and Oakland
accept the matricula as official identification, and Los Angeles is
doing so on a trial basis.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties also accept it.
In June, the state Assembly passed a resolution urging all local
governments to follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making a special effort to get this accepted in all
counties in California," Gamboa said.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez says there is good reason.
Immigrants were being robbed in the city's downtown, targeted by
thieves who knew they were carrying large amounts of cash because
they did not have the identification necessary to open a bank
account, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, however, the problem has waned because Wells
Fargo and Bank of America have agreed to accept the matricula as
formal ID, the chief said. The card also helps law enforcement
quickly identify criminal suspects, Lopez said. "Making an
identification can sometimes be very difficult and confusing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Sheriff Bob Brooks is on vacation, and could not be
reached for comment. Undersheriff Craig Underwood said the department
needs to study Flynn's proposal before taking a position.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to enter into discussions on why the proposal is needed
and what its implications are for law enforcement," Underwood said.</TE>

<HD>Davis' Judge Picks Draw Wide Praise</HD>
<DH>Few fault choices, but Simon camp says governor should not
rule out abortion foes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Dolan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like his Republican predecessor, Gov. Gray Davis has favored
prosecutors and high-powered corporate lawyers in his choices for
judgeships.</LD>
<LD>   But the Democratic governor has leavened his selections with
personal injury lawyers, more women and minorities, and a smattering
of criminal defense attorneys and legal advocates for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   In appointing more than 230 judges since taking office, Davis has
received grudging praise even from many of his critics on the left
and right for his largely middle-of-the-road choices.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Bill Simon Jr. campaign for governor
complained that Davis' selections are flawed because he won't appoint
Californians who oppose abortion. Davis' judicial appointments
secretary, Burt Pines, said candidates would not be excluded simply
because they opposed abortion as long as they were pro-choice on the
law.</TE>
<TE>   Scholars and judges say Davis' appointees are similar in outlook
to the kinds of federal judges selected by a fellow Democrat, former
President Clinton. But there is a difference, they add. Clinton had
to win approval from a Republican-dominated Senate for his choices.
Davis needs no legislative approval and has chosen uncontroversial
mainstream Democrats anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics compiled by the San Francisco Daily Journal, a legal
newspaper, show that as of July, 83% of Davis judges had experience
in civil law and 60% had worked as prosecutors. Many had both
backgrounds. Only 22% had ever been criminal defense lawyers, and
even fewer, 6%, had worked in legal aid.</TE>
<TE>   Davis refuses to name any lawyer who is not rated as qualified by
state bar evaluators, and a greater percentage of his appointees than
his predecessors' have received the bar's highest ratings. An opinion
of unqualified by a local bar association also closes the door to an
appointment, Pines said.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Joan Dempsey Klein, presiding justice of a state Court of
Appeal division in Los Angeles, described the Davis judges as perhaps
"a tad more conservative" than the Clinton appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "I would not classify any of the appointments I know of as
'liberal' in the sense that word is used in common vernacular," Klein
said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also has named a greater percentage of women and minorities
than his Republican predecessors, and appointed five openly gay
judges. Observing that 34% of Davis' judicial appointments have been
women, Klein said the National Assn. of Women Judges will soon pass a
resolution commending the governor for promoting women.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Appointments Praised</TE>
<TE>   A prosecutors group and a conservative law-and-order nonprofit
organization both praised Davis' judicial appointments. They also
noted that his staff always asks local prosecutors to comment on
those he is considering for the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't gone off to the dark side and appointed the wild-eyed
libs," said Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury. The
Republican prosecutor described Davis' judicial picks as excellent.</TE>
<TE>   Nor has the governor shut out candidates with more liberal
backgrounds, especially in such counties as San Francisco and Alameda
that tend to support liberal Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially when he was picking judges, candidates would be out of
the picture entirely unless they jumped up and down with enthusiasm
[for] the death penalty," said Golden Gate Law School Dean Peter
Keane, a former public defender in San Francisco. "The questions now
being put to candidates are the realistic ones, like whether or not
you would apply the law."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Davis hasn't made everyone happy. Fresno County Dist.
Atty. Edward W. Hunt said he fears that one of Davis' appointees in
Fresno might not give prosecutors a fair shake, "but by and large he
has appointed judges who are pretty well-balanced."</TE>
<TE>   Sean Walsh, a spokesman for Simon, said abortion opponents should
not be excluded from judgeships. "Gov. Davis is very proud of
speaking of great freedoms and our democratic process, but he has
litmus tests with regard to whom he is going to appoint as judges,"
said the Simon campaign official.</TE>
<TE>   Pines denied that Davis has a litmus test, but said, "Generally,
the people who have been appointed have shared the governor's views
on women's reproductive rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Some may not have approved of abortion for themselves
personally," Pines added,  "but were nevertheless pro-choice."</TE>
<TE>   Pines screens judicial candidates for Davis and recommends
appointments. He said the governor will not put ideologues on the
bench. Davis, he said, does "not want people to move the law to the
right or the left or use the courts to solve social problems."</TE>
<TE>   The governor also wants them to share his views on everything from
abortion rights to public safety. Candidates are asked not just about
the death penalty but also about criminal sentencing, search and
seizure law, and police practices. They also are grilled on legal
precedents that affect business.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not ask them how they would rule on a particular matter, nor
do I instruct them how they should rule," Pines said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also has been criticized for insisting that appellate judges
have experience as trial jurists. The requirement has limited the
pool of candidates because of the dearth of Democrats on Superior
Courts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Davis has elevated some trial judges who are in their
60s, a factor that could limit how long they serve. He also has
rapidly promoted two of his trial bench appointees to the appellate
level and elevated a few Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "He has raised the quality of the California courts by a notch,"
said UC Berkeley law professor Steve Barnett. "But in my view, the
appellate courts need some new blood that would be provided by
practitioners, politicians, academics and the like."</TE>
<TE>   Consider the mix Davis has appointed: Longtime Los Angeles
prosecutor Harvey Giss went to the Los Angeles Superior Court, yet so
did former criminal defense and legal aid lawyer Fred J. Fujioka.</TE>
<TE>   Also named to the Los Angeles bench was Luis A. Lavin, an openly
gay Latino who previously had been an ethics commissioner for the
city of Los Angeles and enforced civil rights laws for the U.S.
Department of Justice.</TE>
<TE>   In conservative Orange County, Davis appointed business litigator
Cormac J. Carney to the Superior Court. The Bush administration just
tapped Carney for the federal bench.</TE>
<TE>   Because former Govs. George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson appointed
so many prosecutors, the California bench was short on judges with
extensive civil litigation or family law experience. Some presiding
judges and many lawyers asked the Davis administration to address
that need.</TE>
<TE>   "It took him an awfully long time to get warmed up and get the
appointments moving," said University of Santa Clara law professor
Gerald Uelmen, "but I think he has really succeeded in attracting a
high caliber of civil litigators to the bench.... A lot of them are
apolitical."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Recent Diversity Noted</TE>
<TE>   Several lawyers said they sensed that Davis' more recent
appointments have been less conservative and more ethnically diverse
than those he made earlier in his term.</TE>
<TE>   "He is now appointing a more diverse bench, but the criticism is
that he has waited until the 11th hour to do that," said Jeff Adachi,
San Francisco public defender-elect. "You have to ask, is this
pandering to minority groups before an election or is this genuine
commitment to diversity?"</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clara County Dist. Atty. George Kennedy, a Republican, said
Davis' appointees have been worth the wait.</TE>
<TE>   "He has gotten great diversity without having to dip down into
people who have inadequate qualifications," Kennedy said. "We have
gotten really good people, not quick political picks ... [or] crazy
like the Jerry Brown people."</TE>
<TE>   Bay Area criminal defense lawyer Christine Arguedas said the
"pro-law enforcement" governor "isn't going to let anyone get to his
right when it comes to crime and punishment."</TE>
<TE>   "But within that mold, he has made some real quality
appointments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' most visible appointee is California Supreme Court Justice
Carlos R. Moreno, a moderate Democrat and the first Latino on the
state high court in 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   The only Democrat on the court, Moreno sided with its more
conservative members in a 4-3 January ruling that said police may
search vehicles without a warrant if a driver fails to produce a
license or registration. The justice whom Moreno replaced, the late
Stanley Mosk, probably would have voted the other way and the
majority would have ruled against the police.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe for some he is not liberal enough," said Dennis Fischer, a
criminal defense appellate lawyer, "but it is early.... There are
times when I am not sure about Moreno's philosophy, but when he
dissents, his dissents are so well reasoned and so well written that
I just think he holds great promise for the California Supreme
Court."</TE>
<TE>   As the months have passed, Moreno has shown that he is not afraid
to disagree with most of his colleagues or to stand alone.</TE>
<TE>   He joined a dissent in which the high court upheld the death
penalty in a case in which the condemned man's attorney had failed to
call a single witness in the sentencing portion of the trial. The
defendant had suffered a tragic childhood and extreme racism in the
South.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno also wanted to go further than the rest of the court in a
case holding that diseased smokers could sue tobacco companies in
California for fraud and misrepresentation.</TE>
<TE>   The majority limited the victory for plaintiffs by ruling that
smokers could not present evidence of any industry misconduct that
occurred during a 10-year period in which a state law provided
cigarette makers with immunity in California.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno opposed carving out that exception, which could imperil
three huge jury awards that had already been won against the
industry.</TE>

<HD>As Angels Diversify, So Does Fan Base</HD>
<DH>With new players and a lot of advertising, the team has
courted the Latino community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dave McKibben</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago, when XPRS reluctantly signed on as the
Spanish-language radio broadcaster for the Anaheim Angels, executives
at the station brooded. This, they worried, could kill their product.</LD>
<LD>   "Latinos aren't supposed to go to Angels games," said Khaled
Abdelwahed, general sales manager for the Hollywood-based AM station
at 1090 on the dial. The team had no connection to the Latino
community, no Latino players and no expectation that anything would
change.</LD>
<LD>   But things have indeed changed. The Angel lineup now has six
Latino players, including Francisco Rodriguez, the 20-year-old
pitcher who is suddenly one of the team's brightest stars. In this
magical season in which so much has gone right for the team, the
Angels have invested heavily and successfully in building a fan base
in Orange County's fast-growing Latino community.</LD>
<TE>   Two decades after the Dodgers led the way with Fernando-mania --
setting the standard for scouting talent abroad and then marketing
that talent to its multicultural communities -- the Angels are like
the little brother who has finally grown up.</TE>
<TE>   As they have built an ethnically diverse team, they have plastered
ads aimed at Latinos on bus shelters in Anaheim and Santa Ana, poured
money into advertising on the rock en espanol radio stations that
blare Shakira and Chayanne, and produced TV commercials depicting a
Latino player taking batting practice on a pinata.</TE>
<TE>   Team officials say more Latino families are attending games, fans
are tuning into the Angels instead of Mexican soccer clubs such as
Chivas and Cruz Azul, and sponsors are flocking to buy ad time during
XPRS broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings for Spanish-language broadcasts of the games have doubled,
ad sales have gone up as much as 400%, and according to a team
survey, Latinos now make up 15% to 20% of the stadium crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time, [the Angels] forgot about us," said Angel Orea,
owner of a Santa Ana soccer store whose son has been won over as an
Angel fan. "You used to see only Caucasians at the games. But they've
made an impact this year with their advertising. Now, they are the
talk of our town."</TE>
<TE>   They weren't always. The Angels have reached out to Latinos
before, but only in limited fashion. Posting bilingual signs at
Edison Field, printing pocket schedules in Spanish and broadcasting
games on Spanish-language radio stations failed to win over a
soccer-crazed community to a team that seemed so foreign.</TE>
<TE>   Although many of the game's brightest stars are now from Latin
America, the Angels went 10 years without producing a single Latino
player from their farm system. For years, the team was reluctant to
put money into scouring Mexico and Latin America for players, content
instead to invest in big-name stars it hoped would lure fans and
produce a winning team. In 1998, Puerto Rican catcher Bengie Molina
became the Angels' first home-grown Latino player in a decade.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Community Link</TE>
<TE>   "We can't control the makeup of the team, but it makes our job a
lot easier when there's a connection to community," said Robert
Alvarado, Angels' director of marketing and promotions.</TE>
<TE>   The need to connect with Latino fans is a lesson other area teams
learned years earlier. Four years ago, ESPN broadcast a program
examining the outreach successes of the Dodgers and Padres. During
the broadcast, viewers were told about a Spanish-speaking Angel fan
calling the team's offices seeking season tickets. The woman was
transferred from person to person in the ticket office for 15 minutes
while employees looked for a bilingual worker. The episode angered
then-General Manager Tony Tavares, and he vowed to improve relations
with Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   For the Angels, the potential market is impressive. Santa Ana,
which sits in the shadow of Edison Field, has the largest percentage
of Latinos (71%) of any large city in the nation. It also has the
highest concentration of Spanish-speaking residents in the nation,
with about 15% of those ages 18 to 64 speaking no English -- nearly
four times the California average.</TE>
<TE>   According to the 2000 census, the number of Latinos living in
Orange County surged 46.1% in the last decade. The increases were far
greater in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, areas that team
executives view as "Angel country."</TE>
<TE>   This season, with a winning, multicultural team and a long-term
marketing strategy aimed at Latinos, the Angels are seeing new fans
jump aboard and the allegiances of others being challenged. On a few
occasions this year, the Angels have had larger market shares on
Latino radio stations than the Dodgers -- a first, according to XPRS
officials. In a late-season survey of fans attending home games, 15%
of the respondents identified themselves as Latinos, almost double
what it was two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish-language news media are responding. Early in the
season, with the team slumping and marketing efforts still in their
infancy, only La Opinion was using its credentials on a regular
basis. But throughout the playoffs, up to 10 local Spanish-language
outlets have been showing up at games, Angel officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Employing the slogan, "Lanzate a la Diversion," or Join the Fun,
the Angels have flooded Spanish-language television with commercials
featuring Latino coaches and players.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the spots, Molina and Benji Gil show up at a 5-year-old
Latino boy's backyard birthday party. The boy is having a hard time
busting open the pinata with a stick. Molina suggests that "the trick
is to swing really hard." Gil then swings at the pinata, candy flying
everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   In May, Angel manager Mike Scioscia, three Latino coaches and two
players attended a lunch with local Latino media representatives,
hoping to build relationships that had never existed. Latino coaches
and players stopped by youth baseball clinics in Santa Ana, Tustin
and Anaheim. Molina visited grade schools in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Owner?</TE>
<TE>   The buzz around Latino neighborhoods has grown louder since
Mexican billionaire Carlos Peralta confirmed he was among those
interested in buying the Angels from Disney, which has been trying to
sell the team for three years. Peralta, who owns one of Mexico's top
baseball teams, the Tigres of Puebla, told reporters he was
encouraged to see so many Latinos among the sellout crowd when he
attended the regular-season finale against Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   "Wouldn't it be great to see a Mexican owner bring a few more
young players here from Mexico?" said Orea, the Santa Ana soccer
store owner. "People are getting excited about the possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   The investment appears to be paying dividends. An attitude and
tracking study of 200 married-with-children Orange County Latinos
(male and female, ages 18 to 39) gave Angel officials some
encouraging signs. In April, only 9% of those surveyed said the
Angels were the first baseball team that came to mind. In early
September, before Rodriguez joined the team, 16% of a similar group
answered the same way. By September, the number of Latinos who had
seen an Angel ad jumped from 9% to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of Friends</TE>
<TE>   Felipe Flores, a 30-year-old Santa Ana resident, was already sold
on the Angels. Flores had been attending games for 10 years, but he
rarely saw other Latino faces in the crowd. This year, Flores has
often been joined at games by as many as 20 friends, many of them
former Dodger and Giant fans.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think its just because the Angels are suddenly a winning
team, because the Dodgers and Giants have had great seasons too,"
Flores said. "I think all the advertising they've done on television
has made a difference."</TE>

<HD>Troubled Home for Children May Close</HD>
<DH>The MacLaren center for abused and neglected youth could be
replaced by a group facility to settle a lawsuit that alleges
violations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evelyn Larrubia and Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County is discussing the possibility of closing MacLaren
Children's Center, its troubled shelter for abused and neglected
children, and replacing it with a group home to settle a lawsuit
alleging widespread violations of federal law in its treatment of
mentally ill children, officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   County officials said there has been no final decision on the fate
of the El Monte facility but confirmed that they are talking about
its fate with the public interest law firms that sued them in July.</LD>
<LD>   "As part of the negotiations, we are discussing what to do with
[MacLaren]," said county Chief Administrative Officer David Janssen.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, MacLaren houses about 145 children who cannot be placed
in other settings such as foster or group homes. Many are older and
have psychological problems. Critics say a shelter designed to keep
children for brief stints has become a virtual warehouse for the
county's most troubled foster youths.</TE>
<TE>   Paula Gamboa, head of the union that represents county social
workers, said the plan being discussed is to replace MacLaren with a
group home that can provide regular care for a stable population of
children. "We're looking at trying to start something that's more
geared to abused and neglected kids."</TE>
<TE>   John Oppenheim, chief deputy of the county's Department of
Children and Family Services, said his agency is trying to focus
increasingly on placing foster children in local homes rather than
MacLaren. "It's clearly a better way to meet the needs of children,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   MacLaren, which was originally a probation camp, has long been a
lightning rod for controversy. This year's grand jury concluded that
it costs $270,000 annually to care for each child at MacLaren. It
also found that some children had lived there for years rather than
the formal 90-day limit.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California
and five other public interest law firms sued the county, alleging it
had failed to follow federal laws mandating that foster children get
mental health services.</TE>
<TE>   "Far too many children with behavioral and emotional problems are
bounced between multiple foster placements and group homes that do
not meet their individual needs," the lawsuit alleges. "Then, when
their conditions predictably deteriorate, they are effectively
abandoned by the system, consigned to languish in psychiatric
hospitals and secure congregate facilities such as MacLaren
Children's Center, under notorious and deplorable conditions."</TE>
<TE>   County officials acknowledged that they had yet to provide
adequate services and soon entered settlement talks.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys who filed the lawsuit said Monday that they could
not comment on settlement negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Santana, a spokesman for Supervisor Gloria Molina, said
that replacing MacLaren with a group home would be the logical
outcome of reforms launched last year that reduced the number of
children sheltered there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not impossible given the fact that so many reforms are
taking place leading in that direction," he said.</TE>

<LD>Today's stupid-criminal-tricks dispatch concerns a burglar who was
first stunned to find that the Hollywood apartment he'd entered was
occupied by the resident. Then, when the intruder fled, his escape
was slowed by the fact that he ran into a closet. He eventually found
the real front door but was apprehended on the street. Officers
"showed him the back door of a police car and the back seat too,"
commented the Thin Blue Line, the Los Angeles police union's
newspaper. "No way out of that one."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Under a misspell: Dolores Russell of Huntington Beach received a
political mailer from a group that probably won't win the votes of
many school teachers (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: Cary Gepner of Topanga discovered a
not-so-bottomless pit (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of the pits, Mark Zeavin of Altadena came across a type
of gas heater I've never heard of, and don't want to know anything
about (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Could have fooled me: In Nevada, C. V. Di Pol of Woodland Hills
spotted a residence whose owners didn't want anyone to get the wrong
idea about the furnishings in the frontyard.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Child's play: While discussing the theft of a tomato from a
resident's bush by a woman pushing a baby stroller, I recalled a Sue
Grafton thriller in which a hit man would lug his child along on his
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Well, Mil Harris of San Luis Obispo was reminded of growing up in
New York City during Prohibition when "my father set up his big
copper still in the bathtub every Friday night." There would be no
baths for her or her eight siblings that evening.</TE>
<TE>   "When he had colored and bottled the whiskey," Harris said, "he
would tuck the pint bottles under the mattresses in our doll
carriages. He'd send my sister Rita and me off with the same warning,
'Get the money first before you give them the whiskey.' Rita and I
loved it because our shakier customers were so glad to see us, they
tipped us generously."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A quarter for your thoughts: Don't know if you've heard, but Gov.
Gray Davis is asking folks to submit a coin design for the new
California state quarter (this is not related to his never-ending
appeals for folks to send him dollars in campaign contributions).
Anyway, Davis wants a design that captures the heart of California.
If you'd like to use the undeniable power of this column to push your
cause, feel free to send me your sketch as well. If it's weird
enough, I'll publish it.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, I hardly need add that if the Angels win the World
Series, only one figure should grace the coin: the sacred Rally
Monkey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I make it a policy to steer clear of sport utility
vehicles, and I'd be doubly careful in the case of the one observed
in Beverly Hills by Henry Hespenheide of L.A. This SUV's vanity plate
warned: UHITISU. Ah, the joy of driving in Southern California.</TE>

Plumbing</TE>
<TE>   Employment History:</TE>
<TE>   * Internship with CREEP, the Committee to Re-Elect the President,
1972. (I don't like to brag, but it was my idea to order the extra
anchovies on those 200 pizzas we had delivered to that Democratic
rally, saying Ted Kennedy ordered them.)</TE>
<TE>   * "Gofer" for Dick Tuck, the Democratic trickster who, when
Nixon's train stopped in San Luis Obispo so Nixon could make a speech
from the observation car during the 1962 gubernatorial campaign, put
on a conductor's uniform and ordered the train to pull out while
Nixon was still talking.</TE>
<TE>   * Consultant to certain Orange County Republicans I cannot name: I
recruited the phony Democratic candidate on the ballot in a special
Assembly election to pull votes from a stronger Democrat to help the
Republicans win. What the hey -- my guys won, and I'm not in prison,
right?</TE>
<TE>   * Consultant to Sen. John Warner reelection campaign in Virginia:
I was the one who used the nail scissors to cut a guy's head out of a
picture of him with the black governor, Doug Wilder, and Bill
Clinton, and replace it with the head of the Democratic candidate,
and used the composite for a political ad. What the hey -- it worked,
and I'm still not in prison, right?</TE>
<TE>   * Talent scout for opponents of Antonio Villaraigosa's campaign
for mayor: I hired the woman who impersonated Gloria Molina's voice
and called herself "Gloria Morina" in the recorded phone messages
warning voters off Villaraigosa. Hey, just what is the statute of
limitations on that, anyway?</TE>
<TE>   * Primary campaign consultant to Gray Davis: I helped put together
that $10-million ad campaign against Dick Riordan that knocked
Riordan out of the GOP race and put Bill Simon up against Davis,
which is like putting Tyson up against Lewis -- Shari Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   References: Donald Segretti, Professor Liddy, Bob Mulholland</TE>
<TE>   Name and Address of Employer Who Dismissed You: I don't like to
say, but you'd know him just by his hair, and he lives in Sacramento,
which lets Bart Simpson out.</TE>
<TE>   Job Title and Description: unofficially, saboteur. My job was to
derail the Bill Simon campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Weekly Salary: Let's just say the high four figures. It's a long
time between campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Describe Why You Were Let Go From Your Job: Don't you people read
the papers? Who needs a professional political saboteur on the
payroll when the candidate is doing the job for you? Lemme remind
you:</TE>
<TE>   Simon says he won't release his tax returns, but then he will, and
when he does, it's peekaboo, striptease, look fast, don't blink.</TE>
<TE>   He says he's against gay rights, then he signs a pledge backing
gay pride day, then he says no he didn't sign it, an advisor used his
computerized signature. Some advisors. He goes through four campaign
managers by Labor Day, fires half his staff. I mean, this guy seems
to set his watch by every clock he passes.</TE>
<TE>   He whines about Davis getting campaign dough from Metabolife, and
then it turns out he got a little money from Metabolife, too, but he
says, oh, that's different.</TE>
<TE>   And the real doozy: This month he goes on a tear about the
"evidence" of Davis taking a campaign contribution in a government
office, which is illegal, and that there's a picture to prove it,
except it turns out the picture was taken in some rich guy's den in
Santa Monica, on a day that state offices aren't even open. And so
Simon's gotta climb down off that horse. These guys are holding a gun
to their own heads and saying, "Don't come any closer or I'll shoot."</TE>
<TE>   I mean, it couldn't have turned out better if I had set it all up
myself. So they canned me.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I didn't have big plans to bring down Simon -- I did. I
can't really tell you about them. They're trade secrets. But every
time I set out to launch something, Simon and his people got there
first, tripping over their own feet.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame, really. It could've been a beaut of a campaign. One
of my best.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm thinking of a change in scenery, getting out of California,
maybe heading to one of those tropical places where the elections are
always questionable, so no questions asked. You can mail my
unemployment checks to Florida, right?</TE>

<HD>Schwarzenegger's Star Power Drives Prop. 49</HD>
<DH>The measure to fund after-school children's programs has
broad support. But opponents say it could create state budget
problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carla Rivera</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger, the architect and sponsor of Proposition 49,
was at a town hall luncheon in Beverly Hills last week to press for
passage of the November ballot measure that would require funding of
more children's after-school programs.</LD>
<LD>   Right away, the film star's charisma, and its effect on some
voters, became apparent. "Hello Arnold," began a friendly question
from the Beverly Hilton audience of about 500 business and community
leaders. "I call you Arnold, although I don't know you. But I feel
like I know you."</LD>
<LD>   That sense of intimacy and the appeal of a child-centered issue
may go far in explaining why Proposition 49 has such diverse
supporters -- from the California Teachers Assn. to the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Assn. -- despite others' serious misgivings about its
effect on state finances.</LD>
<TE>   The initiative also has fed speculation that it may be a handy
entree into the political arena for Schwarzenegger, who is a
Republican. He has admitted that he "flirted" with the idea of
running for governor after the White House encouraged him last year.
At the town hall event, he deflected a question about his political
ambitions, joking, "This is a decision that I leave to the
Almighty--my wife, Maria." His wife is television newswoman Maria
Shriver.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the attention generated by his child initiative won't hurt.
The After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002, if passed,
would dedicate as much as $550 million a year to before- and
after-school programs for California's elementary and junior high
school students.</TE>
<TE>   Significantly, the measure specifies that funding for programs
would be automatically appropriated from the state's general fund
each year, without legislative action, and could be amended only with
voter approval.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 49 does not raise taxes, unlike Proposition 10, the
successful 1998 initiative that raised the tobacco tax to fund early
childhood education programs. That measure also was sponsored by a
well-known celebrity, actor and director Rob Reiner, who has been
mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for governor.
Schwarzenegger argues that his measure will pay for itself in reduced
crime, welfare and child-care costs. Proponents cite studies
reporting that children who participate in after-school programs are
less likely to commit violent crimes, be victims of violent crime,
skip school, repeat grades or use alcohol, drugs and tobacco.</TE>
<TE>   Every charter and public school could apply for funding.
Elementary schools would be eligible for grants of as much as $50,000
per year and middle and junior high schools, $75,000 a year. Schools
would have to match a portion of the grants through private or
district sources. Schools with existing after-school programs would
get priority for funding, as would those serving low-income students.</TE>
<TE>   Eligible programs would have to provide academic support such as
homework assistance and tutoring and enrichment activities such as
sports, computer training and fine arts.</TE>
<TE>   Current state funding for after-school programs is about $117
million annually and supports about 130,000 students. But educators
estimate that an additional 1 million children 5 to 14 years old
could benefit from after-school programs but lack access.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger said Proposition 49 is an extension of his work
with other childhood programs, such as the Los Angeles Inner-City
Games. He also has worked for the Special Olympics and was chairman
of the Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under former President
George H. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "Children are really helpless. They can't fight for themselves, so
we have to do it," Schwarzenegger said in his town hall address. "Why
are we struggling to have more after-school programs? Because
politicians don't see kids, [kids] don't vote. In Sacramento, when it
comes to children's issues, [the politicians] are asleep."</TE>
<TE>   A recent Los Angeles Times poll found that 55% of potential voters
surveyed statewide supported the proposition, with 31% opposed and
14% saying they did not know. The pro-Proposition 49 campaign has
amassed a war chest of $8 million and counting for television and
radio advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 49 has been endorsed by former Gov. Pete Wilson,
current Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, most school boards, law enforcement
agencies, district attorneys and mayors, including Los Angeles Mayor
James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   But a few legislators, such as Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred
Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), have recently withdrawn their endorsements,
and others have said they want to study the measure more closely
because of possible implications for state budgets. Though not taking
a stand on the measure, the state's Legislative Analyst and the
California Budget Project, a nonprofit fiscal research group,
suggested that Proposition 49's built-in protections could lead to
cuts in other social, health and educational programs during an
economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   "Proposition 49 eliminates the ability of the Legislature to
reduce [after-school] funding, even if demand for the program
decreases or more effective programs were identified," concludes the
Budget Project study.</TE>
<TE>   The California Federation of Teachers opposes the measure, calling
it a "new mandate without new funding."</TE>
<TE>   The League of Women Voters of California also opposes the measure,
despite the league's "strong advocacy for quality after-school
programs." The League disputes assertions that future growth in state
revenue would fund the program.</TE>
<TE>   Under Proposition 49, the new funding could begin as soon as 2004,
if the non-education portion of the state general fund increases by
at least $1.5 billion over the highest such spending level in the
previous four years. Opponents argue that the $1.5-billion cushion is
not enough, since much of that spending would be the result of
cost-of-living adjustments and increased numbers of people who need
state programs, rather than funding for new programs.</TE>
<TE>   "Proposition 49 is a bad approach to a good cause," said League
President Barbara Inatsugu in the ballot rebuttal. "Prop. 49 looks
good, but in reality it disregards principles of good government by
reducing government's flexibility to respond to changing needs and
priorities."</TE>
<TE>   Still, opponents have been able to muster scant organized or
funded opposition.</TE>
<TE>   And there is, of course, Schwarzenegger. He brushed aside any
criticisms with Terminator-like bravado.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best, safest, soundest initiative ever written, and
that's why it's going to succeed," he said.</TE>

<LD>An archeologist for the Presidio suffered burns and blisters on her

chemical, possibly mustard gas, found on the grounds, a spokesman for
the former Army base said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The vials were unearthed by Presidio Trust volunteers near an area
of the national park known as Inspiration Point, where they were
doing plant restoration work.</LD>
<LD>   The injured archeologist, Megan Wilkinson, was examining the vials
when she noticed a strong odor coming from them. She left the
building and called the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration.</LD>
<TE>   Trust spokesman Ron Sonenshine said the vials are believed to
contain crystallized mustard gas that was used at the location for
Army training exercises in the 1960s.</TE>

<HD>Citywide Secession Push Starts Slowly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy and Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new push by San Fernando Valley and Hollywood secessionists to
build support outside those areas got off to a shaky start Monday
when a kickoff event in Westchester drew only about a dozen people.</LD>
<LD>   Later Monday, the last pre-election meeting of the secession group
Valley VOTE got a bigger turnout -- about 100 -- in North Hills,
where breakup leaders urged volunteers to step up their efforts for
the final two weeks of the campaign. The evening gathering at an auto
dealership got a surprise when Los Angeles City Councilman Nate
Holden dropped by and gave the campaign a $500 personal check.</LD>
<LD>   In Westchester, the Alliance for a New L.A., which claims to
represent secession supporters across Los Angeles, held a news
conference to open its headquarters for the citywide drive. But only
three of the alliance's eight co-chairs attended the event, and among
the no-shows was group President Bill Allen.</LD>
<TE>   Also missing were co-chairs from Watts, the Valley NAACP president
and the head of the Mexican American Political Assn. The slim turnout
marked the latest setback for the secession campaign, which has
struggled for weeks to raise money and marshal volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, an alliance co-chairman, Robert Scott, said the
organization intends to counter Mayor James K. Hahn's $5-million
media campaign against Valley and Hollywood cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really concerned ... [that] the campaign be run honestly
and that the people look behind the blizzard of slick mailers that is
being sent out by the billionaire boys club downtown," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that if secession fails, the group will stay together
to pursue a city reorganization and fight the mayor's plan to change
state law to make future breakup efforts more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to fight through and beyond to whatever time it
takes in order to achieve our goal, which is to reorganize Los
Angeles," Scott said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the predictions the alliance made on Monday was that
harbor-area voters will back Valley and Hollywood secession by a wide
margin. Conspicuously, Andrew Mardesich, a secession leader in San
Pedro, was one of the co-chairs who skipped the event.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted later, Mardesich said he stayed home to do remodeling
work. He said he joined the alliance to promote reform of the city
and, although he will vote for secession on Nov. 5, he is not
confident about the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I think its going to be unlikely to pass [citywide]," Mardesich
said. "There is just too much money being spent by the city people to
spread misinformation."</TE>
<TE>   Valley mayoral candidate Mel Wilson said the alliance will help a
grass-roots campaign overcome the opposition's media blitz with mass
e-mailings and neighbors talking to neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "They are going to win the air war, but we can win the ground
war," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson, meanwhile, picked up the endorsement Monday of a group of
12 liberal candidates for the proposed Valley City Council. Robert
Goldsobel, a member of the Valley Alliance of Liberals, said Wilson
"stood out as a leader."</TE>
<TE>   At the Valley VOTE meeting, which attracted mainly longtime
supporters of a breakup, secession leader Richard Katz noted that
polls have shown the Valley and Hollywood measures trailing. "We just
have to prove them wrong one more time," Katz said.</TE>
<TE>   Holden delivered a short speech after presenting his $500
contribution. He stopped short of endorsing secession, but said he
wants to give the campaign "a chance."</TE>
<TE>   The councilman also said Hahn has exaggerated the potential harm
secession could cause the city.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Hahn's office said he will address the pro-secession
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. on Dec. 10. Hahn had angered the
group when he backed out of a Nov. 1 speaking engagement.</TE>

<HD>Fate of Solvang Man's Dream Is Up in the Air</HD>
<DH>Debate has gone round and round for years in town on a
proposal to build a Ferris wheel. Voters will have their say Nov. 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Veronique de Turenne</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>SOLVANG, Calif.</DL>
<LD>In a town with enough windmills for a dozen Don Quixotes, Gary Jensen
is tilting at Ferris wheels. One Ferris wheel, actually, which he
wants to build on a vacant lot he's owned since 1971. And he'd like
you to call it the Tivoli Wheel.</LD>
<LD>   A scaled-back replica of the ride in Copenhagen's famed Tivoli
Gardens, Jensen's wheel would seem a perfect match for Solvang, which
celebrates all things Danish. But resistance has turned his quixotic
quest into a 10-year battle with the city and some of its residents.</LD>
<LD>   Too tacky, goes the anti-Ferris wheel lament. Delightfully Danish,
the Tivoli Wheel's backers reply. On Nov. 5, both sides will get
their say when the matter goes to a vote in the form of Measure L.</LD>
<TE>   Jensen, who collected 327 valid signatures to place the matter of
the wheel on the ballot, needs a simple majority for his project to
go ahead. A similar measure in 1994 was defeated when 55% of voters
said no.</TE>
<TE>   "If they would just let me try it and show that it won't harm
anything -- that's all I really want," Jensen said. He's spending his
own money on fliers and television commercials in which family
members explain the specifics of the Tivoli Wheel and ask for voters
to give it a whirl.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not right for Solvang, I'll take it down," said Jensen,
who estimates he'll spend several hundred thousand dollars to make
the wheel a reality. "But please, let me at least try."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen got the idea for the Tivoli Wheel about 15 years ago, when
friends from Denmark described the Tivoli Gardens and showed him a
brochure with the Danish wheel on the cover.</TE>
<TE>   He immediately imagined a Tivoli Wheel transforming the dirt
parking lot just outside the main village area that he bought in
1971. "I thought, 'What a great thing to bring here,' " Jensen said.
"It's as Danish as can be."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen's original plan for the wheel, submitted in the early
1990s, proved too tall. He made the rounds of the city's building
department and planning commission. After several tries, he came up
with a scaled back version with six passenger baskets that hang from
hot air balloons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's completely authentic, literally copied from the ride in the
Tivoli Gardens," said Lawrence Thompson, a Santa Barbara architect
who designed the site. Thompson's plans include flowering trees and
shrubs to screen the ride, as well as an abundant use of flowers.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a story of incredible dedication to a dream," Thompson
said. "Gary Jensen is taking a very ugly parking lot and turning it
into a charming space."</TE>
<TE>   But neighbors at the nearby Santa Ines Mission fail to see the
charm. At 49 feet high, the wheel would tower over the mission walls,
which are 10 to 12 feet high. They fear that noise from revelers will
disturb the mission grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a 49-foot wheel with, well, I won't call them
'screaming' children, but certainly excited children, making joyful
sounds as they go around and around on the wheel overlooking our
property," said Father Michael Mahoney, pastor of the Santa Ines
Mission.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney worries that visitors to the mission will be disturbed by
the sounds and sights of the Tivoli Wheel. "One thing that is very
important to me is that a California mission is of great historical
significance, and our mission here at Santa Ines has been a terrific
part of what Solvang is."</TE>
<TE>   After a decade, the Tivoli Wheel has left its mark on Solvang City
Hall. City Manager Marlene Demery declined to comment on the
commercial appeal of Jensen's proposed ride.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very controversial topic here in town," Demery said.
"People have very strong opinions -- they either think it's a great
way to get more people to come to town, or they are certain it will
drive people away."</TE>
<TE>   Marianne Dix, a longtime Solvang resident, is all for the Tivoli
Wheel: "We used to have a miniature golf course and a movie theater,
and now that they're gone, there's not a lot left for kids to do here
in town," said Dix, who tends bar at a local hotel. "The people I
talk to are for it."</TE>
<TE>   So the wheel is discussed at local watering holes?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sure," Dix said. "But this is Solvang -- we talk about
anything and everything."</TE>

<HD>Parking Ticket Violators May Get 'the Boot'</HD>
<DH>Traffic enforcement team clamps down on drivers with five
or more overdue citations who get 72 hours to pay before vehicle is
towed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugo Martin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crew in the dirty white van crept slowly up to the maroon Honda
Civic parked on Lucile Avenue in Silver Lake. The car's tires were
small -- the perfect size for a small "Rhino" boot.</LD>
<LD>   A few minutes later, the van pulled alongside a gray Nissan Maxima
on Van Ness Avenue in the Wilshire Center neighborhood. For this job,
the large Rhino boot was the right fit.</LD>
<LD>   The van was driven by members of Los Angeles' Habitual Parking
Violators Unit, a crew of street-hardened traffic enforcement
officers who clamp down on parking scofflaws by incapacitating their
vehicles with large wheel locks known as boots.</LD>
<TE>   The small and large Rhino locks are just two of a handful of
heavy, metal boots the city uses as a not-so-subtle reminder to
motorists to pay their tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The officers are also armed with the Helix and Palma boots. The
brightly colored locks -- named for the boot manufacturers -- come in
various sizes and designs. It's not a one-boot-fits-all situation.</TE>
<TE>   The use of this assortment of boots is an example of how the
Habitual Parking Violators Unit -- now in its 15th year in Los
Angeles -- has honed its tactics to more effectively bring problem
parkers to justice.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the unit also replaced slower, bulky computers in
the patrol vans with new high-speed laptop computers that allow crews
to check the number of parking tickets on a dozen cars at a time.</TE>
<TE>   The efforts have paid off. The unit of 14 vans, each operated by
two officers, install up to 90 boots a day -- more than twice as many
as when the program was launched in 1987. Once a car is booted, the
owner has 72 hours to pay the outstanding tickets before the city
tows it away.</TE>
<TE>   The fear of being booted has apparently persuaded many Angelenos
to be more diligent about paying overdue tickets. When the unit was
created, about 65,000 vehicles had five or more outstanding parking
tickets, making them eligible for the boot. Today, fewer than 30,000
vehicles are eligible for the boot.</TE>
<TE>   The booting vans are deployed out of a poorly lighted parking
structure in Hollywood known to traffic officers as "the bat cave."
Like the caped crusader Batman, half of the crews work under cover of
darkness, cruising the city's 6,400 miles of streets from 2 to 7 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   While one officer drives, the other quickly punches license plate
numbers into the laptop. When the computer responds with the message
"BOOT ELIGIBLE," the officers jump out, grab a boot -- each weighs
about 35 pounds -- and get to work.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic Enforcement Officer Joann Maciorowski has been booting
cars for 12 years, and can usually tell by a car's make and model
which boot fits best.</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said the large Rhino locks on tight to those
beefy SUV tires. The smaller Palma boot fits snug on small tires
without hubcaps. Parking officials have even modified a large Rhino
to slide flat along the ground and lock on the wheels of
pavement-hugging low-riders and Corvettes.</TE>
<TE>   Getting a boot that fits snug is crucial. Some people will try
anything to free their cars from the boot's metal jaws. Motorists
have tried to beat, kick, cut and burn the boots off. "Police at the
77th Street Division drove up on a guy hammering away at a boot,"
Maciorowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the motorists are successful. Recently, traffic
enforcement officers came across a Rhino boot, locked onto a
flattened tire in the empty parking spot where a car had been booted.
The owner apparently let the air out of the tire, providing just
enough room to squeeze a wrench under the boot to remove the lug
nuts.</TE>
<TE>   But each boot is valued at more than $500, and removing or
damaging one is a felony. Last year, the city prosecuted at least 30
people for such a crime.</TE>
<TE>   If they can't get the boots off, some people will soil them with
paint or urine. That is one of the reasons Traffic Enforcement
Officer Albert Lilly wears gloves when he handles the boots.</TE>
<TE>   But these are minor offenses compared with the insults Lilly and
other officers routinely endure when motorists catch them booting
their car. "Their first reaction is shock," Lilly said. "Then they
start to scream and yell."</TE>
<TE>   Traffic Enforcement Sgt. John Curtin, who oversees the booting
unit, said his officers are trained to be courteous -- to a certain
point. If a motorist becomes belligerent, he said, the officers are
not obliged to hang around after the boot has been locked on. "It's
called the 15-second attitude test," Curtin said.</TE>
<TE>   He and other traffic enforcement officers say motorists have used
just about every excuse to keep their cars boot-free. But the
officers can instantly verify the excuses with the laptop computers,
which are constantly updated on the status of each parking ticket.
"It doesn't matter if it's the presidential motorcade," Curtin said.
"If it comes up on the computer, we will boot it."</TE>
<TE>   When phony excuses and curses fail, some car owners get violent.
Most traffic officers are armed with pepper spray and a direct radio
link to the police.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly is a brawny man who spent 20 years in the Navy before he
became a traffic enforcement officer. But that did not dissuade a
petite South Los Angeles woman from attacking him a couple of months
ago as he was putting a boot on her car.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just tightening up the boot when this woman caught us by
surprise and jumped on my back," he said. "She was just screaming and
yelling, saying we were not going to boot her car."</TE>
<TE>   Lilly stood up, shrugged the woman off, finished clamping the boot
on and called the police.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not worth it to fight with them," he said. "My goal is to go
home at night."</TE>

<LD>   EXPLANATION KEY</LD>
<LD>   Poll Avg.--The average of The Associated Press media poll (AP) and
USA Today-ESPN coaches poll (U-E). Others receiving votes are
calculated in order received.</LD>

Richard Billingsley (RB), Colley Matrix (CM), Kenneth Massey (WM),
David Rothman (DR), Jeff Sagarin (JS), and the Peter Wolfe (PW)
computer rankings. The computer component will be determined by
averaging six of the rankings. The lowest will be disregarded.</TE>
<TE>   Schedule Rank--Rank of schedule strength (Strgh) compared to other
Division I-A teams divided by 25. This component is calculated by
determining the cumulative won/loss records of the team's opponent
(66.6 percent) and the cumulative won/loss records of the team's
opponent's opponents (33.3 percent).</TE>
<TE>   Losses--One point for each loss (L) during the season.</TE>
<TE>   Quality Win Component--The quality win component (QWin) will
reward to varying degrees teams that defeat opponents ranked among
the top 10 in the weekly standings. The bonus point scale will range
from a high of 1.0 points for a win over the top ranked team to a low
of 0.1 for a victory over the 10th-ranked BCS team. The final BCS
standings will determine final quality win points. If a team
registers a victory over a team more than once during the regular
season quality win points will be awarded just once. Quality win
points are deducted from the team's total of poll average, computer
average, schedule rank and losses.</TE>
<TE>   Total--Total BCS points, by adding poll average, computer average
and schedule ranking, plus one point for each loss.</TE>

<LD>With all the running around required in soccer, it's easy to
understand why there are not many old-timers wearing whistles and
pulling out yellow cards.</LD>
<LD>   But there are those in soccer who believe the mandatory age limit
of 45 for officials is arbitrary, and want a change.</LD>
<LD>   CONCACAF, the soccer ruling body for North America and the
Caribbean, is asking FIFA, the world body, to abolish its age limit
for referees in international games.</LD>
<TE>   And FIFA is interested in improving refereeing standards after a
series of disputed calls at the 2002 World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "The age limit does not make sense at a time when men are running
marathons in their 60s," said CONCACAF President Jack Warner, who is
also a FIFA vice president. "We would like to see retention on the
FIFA list being a matter of merit."</TE>

<HD>Wang Clears the Air Upon Joining Team</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wang Zhizhi likened his dispute with the Chinese Basketball Assn. to
a quarrel between a mother and a son. Wang, banned from the Chinese
national team after deciding to play with the Clippers instead of
with his countrymen in the Asian Games, said he's not disloyal and
loves his country.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes a mother and her son have disagreements," Wang said
through interpreter Simon Chan during an introductory press
conference Monday at Staples Center. "It doesn't mean the mother and
son don't love each other."</LD>
<LD>   Wang hopes to rejoin the national team soon and to play for China
in the 2008 Olympics, which will be held in Beijing. He said the
dispute began when team officials would not allow him to practice in
preparation for the World Championships at Indianapolis last month.
They wanted Wang to agree to play in the Asian Games. He wanted to
join an NBA team for training camp.</LD>
<TE>   "This is my third NBA season," said Wang, the first player from
China to play in the NBA when he joined the Dallas Mavericks for five
games in 2000-01. "I didn't have a chance to play in training camp."</TE>
<TE>   Wang joined his Clipper teammates for a workout Monday, then
participated in a scrimmage open to the public later that evening at
Staples Center. The Clippers signed Wang to a three-year, $6-million
contract Friday after the Mavericks declined to match their offer
sheet.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands the Xs and O's part of the game," Clipper Coach
Alvin Gentry said when asked if the language barrier would be a
problem for the 7-foot-1 center and his new teammates. "He knows
where the low post is. He knows what a pick and roll is. He has a
good grasp of basketball. He's picked up a lot of things [in two
seasons with the Mavericks]. I think he'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   When asked what he knew of the Clippers, Wang launched into a
lengthy answer in Chinese, mentioning standouts Elton Brand, Lamar
Odom and Michael Olowokandi. The last bit needed no translation.</TE>
<TE>   Wang smiled broadly before tapping both fists to his forehead, as
Quentin Richardson often does after making a big basket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers waived free-agent center Jason Lawson, who averaged
four points in five exhibition games.</TE>

<LD>   What: "The 30 Most Memorable Moments in Baseball History"
videotape and DVD</LD>
<LD>   Producer: Major League Baseball productions and Q Video</LD>
<TE>   Price: $14.95 (videotape), $19.95 (DVD)</TE>
<TE>   The producers of this 1-hour 10-minute videotape and 2-hour DVD
had a difficult task, fitting 30 stories into one show. They
succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a series of entertaining and informative vignettes
of those 30 most memorable moments in baseball history, as selected
by a panel of baseball historians, writers, executives and
celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   These are the same greatest moments announced, in chronological
order, at the All-Star game at Milwaukee in July.</TE>
<TE>   The top five, beginning with No. 5, will be announced during the
pregame show for Game 4 of the World Series on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The moments have already been featured as part of the five-part
series carried by ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   But now the moments are all together on one tape or DVD, which
will be in stores today.</TE>
<TE>   The show opens with Christy Mathewson and his three shutouts in
the 1905 World Series. Other moments follow chronologically through
modern-day feats such as the 1998 home run race between Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa, and Barry Bonds' 73 home runs last season.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD has bonus coverage.</TE>

<LD>Auburn sophomore tailback Carnell "Cadillac" Williams, the
Southeastern Conference's leading rusher with 745 yards, is out for
the season after breaking his left leg in the Tigers' 30-23 overtime
loss at Florida on Saturday.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthony Wheat, the Compton Dominguez High free safety and quarterback
who leads the Southern Section with seven interceptions, will sit out
the rest of the season because of partially torn knee ligaments, Don
Coach Willie Donerson said.</LD>
<LD>   Wheat, a 6-foot-2, 215-pound senior, suffered the injury during
Dominguez's 37-0 loss to Long Beach Jordan on Oct. 11. He missed the
Dons' 22-0 victory over Lynwood last week and underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging exam, which revealed the torn ligaments.</LD>
<LD>   The multitalented Wheat, who also competes in the triple jump on
the track team, is being recruited by USC, California, Illinois and
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fred Washington, a member of The Times' all-star boys' basketball
team last season for Torrance Bishop Montgomery, has committed to
Stanford, Knight Coach Doug Mitchell said.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-6 forward averaged 22.4 points and 8.5 rebounds and shot 53%
from the field for a team that won its third consecutive Southern
Section championship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Mater Dei, ranked No. 1 in several national preseason
boys' basketball polls, will play LeBron James and Akron (Ohio) St.
Vincent-St. Mary at 6:30 p.m. Jan. 4 in the Dream Classic at Pauley
Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   James, a 6-7 senior swingman, is expected to be a lottery pick in
the 2003 NBA draft. Mater Dei is led by 6-5 forward D.J. Strawberry,
who has committed to Maryland, and 6-3 guard Wesley Washington, who
has committed to Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   In other games involving Southland teams, Los Angeles Loyola plays
Lakewood Mayfair at 2:30 p.m. and Compton Centennial plays Carson at
4:45. Brooklyn (N.Y.) Lincoln, led by highly touted junior point
guard Sebastian Telfair, will play Duke-bound junior DeMarcus Nelson
and Vallejo at 8:15.</TE>
<TE>   Admission, which includes all four games, will be $25 or $20 for
floor reserved, $15 for loge and $10 for general admission. Tickets
will be available at the UCLA Central Ticket Office as well as
Ticketmaster beginning Nov. 4.</TE>

<TE>   Alison Costello of Anaheim Esperanza says her ninth-place
performance in the Great American Cross-Country Festival in
Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 28 had a lot to do with her victory in the
sweepstakes race of the Orange County championships at Irvine
Regional Park on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any definite goal heading into [Charlotte],"
Costello said. "I thought I would be running well if I could finish
close to Bethany [Nickless of Fountain Valley]. My attitude was,
'I'll just go out there and see how it goes.' ... But as the race
went on, all of a sudden I was running with all these girls I had
heard of but didn't know what they looked like."</TE>
<TE>   Costello's time of 20:02.3 over the 5,000-meter course at the
Ballantyne Resort made her the top Californian in the meet, putting
her ahead of highly regarded Southern Section runners such as Liza
Pasciuto of Murrieta Valley (12th) and Nickless (20th).</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big race for me," Costello said. "It did a lot for my
confidence."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Mt. San Antonio College Invitational cross-country meet will
try something new Friday when it holds team and individual
sweepstakes races combining the top entries from Divisions III, IV
and V.</TE>
<TE>   Separate sweepstakes races had previously been held in Divisions
III, IV and V, but high school division director Tim O'Rourke decided
to combine them this year in order to give those teams the best
competitive conditions in which to run.</TE>
<TE>   The change means that defending state Division III boys' champion
Barstow and three-time defending state Division IV boys' champion
McFarland will race each other instead of running in separate races.</TE>
<TE>   The Division I-II team and individual sweepstakes races will be
held Saturday morning.</TE>

<LD>In 12 years as a tight end with the Detroit Lions and Los Angeles
Rams, Dave Hill saw lots of hard hits, but none like the one his
7-year-old son Adam took in the backyard.</LD>
<LD>   Dave had just finished bathing the family dogs, two Rottweilers.
Suddenly, the 140-pound male Rottweiler took off and hit Adam
head-first in the chest, knocking him across the yard.</LD>
<LD>   "[The dog] knocked the wind out of him," David said. "He was
laying there in shock. Of course, we were in shock. It was probably
the hardest hit I've seen in my life. I figured from then, he might
be a football player."</LD>
<TE>   Adam is still taking hits as a junior receiver at Anaheim
Esperanza High. He has caught 29 passes for 504 yards and six
touchdowns in helping the Aztecs to a 6-0 start. They play Los
Alamitos (5-0-1) Saturday at Placentia Valencia in a key Sunset
League game.</TE>
<TE>   Playing football is as much a part of life in the Hill household
as watching television. Dave's cousin, Gary Green, played for the
Rams and Kansas City Chiefs. Brother Jim played for the Green Bay
Packers and is a longtime sports reporter for KCBS. Dave's oldest
son, Aaron, is a receiver at Montana State. And his youngest son,
Austin, 11, is already training with the Rottweilers at the family
home in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been around the game forever," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   There are perks for having a father who played in the NFL, such as
being able to hang out with some of his friends, former Rams Eric
Dickerson and LeRoy Irvin.</TE>
<TE>   And since his father is also an assistant coach at Esperanza, Adam
is able to receive insights from a man who knows what it takes to
reach the highest level.</TE>
<TE>   If Adam ever gets mad at his father, he knows what to do. He
simply brings up the sore subject of the Rams losing to the
Washington Redskins in the 1983 and '86 playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets quiet," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   Adam respects his father, not only because his nickname is "Big
Daddy." Dave is 6 feet 3 1/2, 340 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, man, the things he could do," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave offers lessons whenever the two are watching football on
television, explaining pass routes and defensive schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Adam is 6-1, 180 pounds and tough, like his father. He was forced
to play quarterback last season at Esperanza after an injury
sidelined Rick Taloa for the season. It wasn't a pleasant time.
Esperanza struggled to a 4-5-1 record.</TE>
<TE>   Before this season, Adam told Taloa, "You better not get hurt
because I don't want to play quarterback."</TE>
<TE>   Adam has the size, strength and hands to be an excellent receiver.
Improving his speed will be crucial to attracting attention from top
colleges.</TE>
<TE>   "He can be as good as he wants," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said.</TE>
<TE>   Adam can thank the Rottweilers and his brother, Aaron, for
preparing him for football.</TE>
<TE>   There were lots of tackle football games in the backyard, with
Aaron usually using Adam as a tackling dummy.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was playing receiver, he'd play bump and run and demolish
me," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   And then there were the wrestling matches against dad.</TE>
<TE>   "If he'd get one hand off you, he has that other hand and you
can't move," Adam said.</TE>
<TE>   A number of sons of former NFL players of the 1980s have started
to reach the high school or college ranks. The sons of former NFL
players Jackie Slater, Brad Budde and Clay Matthews are playing for
Anaheim Servite, San Clemente and Agoura, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very interesting to see the kids of players I played with
that are now in college or high school," Dave said. "There are
probably certain insights you can give them to the game that they
can't get anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   And Dave still trusts his Rottweilers to prepare his sons for
football.</TE>
<TE>   Even Adam has no hard feelings about being run over by the family
pets.</TE>
<TE>   "It gives me good agility," he said.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal's Status Still in Limbo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal said he's not terribly bored yet, now more than
three weeks since the start of a training camp in which he has not
run a single sanctioned sprint.</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday will be six weeks since the surgery his doctor believes
will free him from the bother of his cranky big toe, six weeks once
being the optimistic end of the estimates for O'Neal's recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, O'Neal spends his hours sweating atop exercise equipment,
watching as replacement centers Soumaila Samake and Samaki Walker
grind toward the regular season, Tim Duncan and David Robinson
waiting first.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm in 100% treadmill shape," O'Neal said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal's next appointment with Dr. Robert Mohr is Thursday
afternoon, he's pretty sure, and though he still feels pain beneath
his afflicted toe, he hopes to be cleared to run by then.</TE>
<TE>   While O'Neal's rehabilitation has not gone poorly, neither has it
been the uncomplicated process the Lakers once hoped would have him
playing games in the first week or so of the season. It is why the
Lakers have all but decided to carry Samake, the 7-footer from Mali,
Africa, first hyped in a Little Rock, Ark., hallway by O'Neal
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Backpedaling some from Saturday night's admission that Samake was
a possible -- and perhaps likely -- starter at center on opening
night, Coach Phil Jackson said Samake still hadn't beaten out Guy
Rucker, a free agent three years out of Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going down to this last week, we'll see who plays best as
far as who's going to make our team, or at least make an effort to
make our team," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   That would be news to most, including the players, who are
assuming Samake is a lock at least until O'Neal is ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, having another true center around has gotten O'Neal to
dreaming.</TE>
<TE>   "He can do all that big-man stuff," he said, grinning, "and I can
get out on the wing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox, Mark Madsen and Tracy Murray visited Miles
Elementary School in Huntington Park after Monday's practice as part
of the NBA's "Reach to Achieve Week." Miles Avenue has 1,800
students.... Brian Shaw, who has a strained groin, did not practice
Monday and said he was unlikely to play tonight in San Diego against
the Cleveland Cavaliers.... Slava Medvedenko has made 19 of 33
field-goal attempts in the exhibition season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Latrell Sprewell of the New York Knicks sued the New York Post for
$40 million for its account of how he injured his right hand, later
met with reporters and denounced the way the team has treated him and
then got word that the Knicks suspended him for tonight's exhibition
game against Utah for failing to follow his rehabilitation program.
The suspension will cost Sprewell $140,000, or 1/90th of his
$12.6-million salary.... Minnesota guard Felipe Lopez is expected to
miss the season after tearing ligaments in his left knee during an
exhibition game against Boston on Saturday.... Detroit Piston forward
Don Reid had surgery on his right Achilles' tendon and is out for the
season. He was hurt against Miami on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Baron Davis' back injury is not getting better, and he could miss
the season opener against Utah on Oct. 30. The New Orleans Hornets
have been describing Davis' injury as back spasms.... Cleveland
rookie guard Dajuan Wagner will remain hospitalized with a bladder
infection and will have more tests. The team had expected Wagner to
be released Monday. He has been in a Cleveland hospital since last
Tuesday and has not played in any of the Cavaliers' exhibition games.</TE>

<HD>Devils Rays to Offer Deal to Piniella to Manage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Tampa Bay Devil Rays will meet today with Lou Piniella and offer
him a contract to become the team's manager.</LD>
<LD>   General Manager Chuck LaMar spoke Monday with agent Alan Nero and
arranged a meeting that will include Piniella and Tampa Bay managing
general partner Vince Naimoli.</LD>
<LD>   "At that time," the team said in a statement, "the Devil Rays will
make a formal contract proposal to Mr. Piniella."</LD>
<TE>   Piniella has a year remaining on his contract as manager of the
Seattle Mariners, but has expressed a desire to work closer to his
home in Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Devil Rays received permission to talk to Piniella
after they agreed to provide compensation to Seattle in the event
they sign the manager.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays, who had the lowest payroll in baseball at about
$34 million last season, are believed to be prepared to offer a deal
with an average salary in excess of the $2.5 million Piniella was to
earn in Seattle next year.</TE>
<TE>   Nero, who has said Piniella also would like to talk to the New
York Mets about their managerial opening, did not return telephone
messages from Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets have targeted Piniella as a possible replacement for
Bobby Valentine, but have been unable to agree with the Mariners on
compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay fired Hal McRae with one year remaining on his contract
after losing a franchise-record 106 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Famer Kirby Puckett declared he is innocent of charges he
dragged a woman into the men's restroom of a restaurant in a
Minneapolis suburb Sept. 6 and groped her.</TE>
<TE>   Puckett, 41, spent less than a half hour in the county jail for a
booking procedure and appearance before a judge. Puckett remains free
on his own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors charged the former Minnesota Twins' star with a felony
count of false imprisonment and a gross misdemeanor count of criminal
sexual conduct.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Puckett probably would be put on probation and given
less than a year in the county workhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Puckett retired in 1995 after 12 seasons with the Twins, a team he
helped win the World Series in 1987 and 1991. He was inducted into
the Hall of Fame last year and is now an executive vice president of
the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   According to the complaint, the victim was waiting to use the
women's restroom at the restaurant when Puckett grabbed her by the
arm and dragged her into the men's room. She told police that Puckett
pushed her into a stall and put his hand on one of her breasts. She
said that after a friend of hers yelled into the restroom, Puckett
let her go.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball</TE>
<TE>   The Orlando Miracle will move next season as part of the WNBA's
restructuring plan.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio has applied for a WNBA franchise in 2003 and is
nearing its goal of 6,000 season ticket deposits. The WNBA is talking
with several people in other cities who are interested in acquiring a
team, the league said in a release.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe strongly in the WNBA product and think it will
continue to succeed in other markets," said John Weisbrod, Chief
Operating Officer of RDV Sports, which owns the Orlando Magic.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would concentrate on its NBA franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we were not able to make it work financially in
Orlando," Weisbrod said.</TE>
<TE>   The WNBA is owned by the 29 NBA owners, and all of its teams have
been in cities where an NBA franchise is located.</TE>
<TE>   But the NBA Board of Governors decided this month to allow non-NBA
owners to acquire teams and to allow teams in non-NBA markets. The
board decided the Charlotte Sting could remain in that city even
though the Hornets moved to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The Miracle had a 60-68 record in four seasons in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Texas El Paso men's coach Jason Rabedeaux, 37, resigned, saying
his heart was not in coaching.</TE>
<TE>   Rabedeaux declined to provide details on his decision. He said
only that it was in the best interest of UTEP, himself and his
family.</TE>
<TE>   Rabedeaux led the Miners to a 23-9 record last season. He replaced
Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Fresno State guard Ashley Knowlton is out for the season after
tearing ligaments in his left knee during practice Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Davenport, ranked No. 1 in the world in 2001 before a
career-threatening knee injury, and Switzerland's Patty Schnyder have
qualified for the season-ending WTA Tour Championships on Nov. 6-11
at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport won the Championships title in 1999 and finished second
in 1994, 1998 and 2001. She couldn't play in the 2001 final against
Serena Williams because of the injury.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven players already had qualified in singles, including
Williams, her sister Venus, Jennifer Capriati and Monica Seles. Three
spots remain up for grabs.</TE>
<TE>   Todd Martin defeated Jarkko Nieminen, 6-3, 7-5, in the first round
of the Stockholm Open. Martin, the 1998 champion, saved 14 break
points.... Russia's Mikhail Youzhny defeated Morocco's Younes El
Aynaoui, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, in the first round of the St. Petersburg Open
in Russia. Fourth-seeded Jiri Novak pulled out of the tournament
because of a groin injury.... Israel's Anna Smashnova defeated
Meghann Shaughnessy, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, in the first round of the
Generali Ladies Open at Linz, Austria.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Peter Ueberroth, former commissioner of Major League Baseball and
president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee for the
1984 Games, was elected chairman of the Amateur Athletic Foundation
of Los Angeles. He succeeds John C. Argue, who died in July.</TE>
<TE>   The AAF, endowed with Southern California's share of the surplus
from the 1984 Olympics, awards grants to youth sports organizations
and establishes its own youth sports programs. It has given out more
than $130 million.</TE>
<TE>   The AAF board also awarded grants worth $535,595 to 13
organizations and allocated $243,715 for its own Run 4 Fun program,
which reaches more than 2,000 youngsters at 55 middle schools in
southern California. The money will also fund instructional clinics
for high schools and community youth sports coaches.</TE>

<HD>Ina Prepares to Fight Ban</HD>
<DH>Olympic pairs skater says she was misled about consequences
of being unable to produce urine sample.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying she had been unable to produce a urine sample for a drug test
during an unannounced, late-night visit to her home by a
representative of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and had been misled
about the consequences, three-time U.S. Olympic pairs skater Kyoko
Ina plans to fight the $1-million fine and lifetime suspension she
faces from the International Skating Union.</LD>
<LD>   The USADA ruled that Ina had refused to be tested July 18 and
followed the same adjudication process as when an athlete tests
positive for banned substances. Ina appealed the finding to the
American Arbitration Assn. and lost, but her lawyer said they will
appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</LD>
<LD>   "The decision is not supported by law and facts," attorney Edward
Williams said Monday from New York. "It's abusive."</LD>
<TE>   Ina contends that a chain of procedural blunders tainted the
testing process. She said the representative's credential had expired
four months earlier. Ina said she was unaware of that at the time,
however, and admitted the woman to her Greenwich, Conn., home because
"I knew her, so I assumed the credentials were legal."</TE>
<TE>   Ina also said the woman had been unfamiliar with rules relating to
testing procedures and had been accompanied by a man who did not work
for the agency but acted as if he did.</TE>
<TE>   "They have my career in their hands," Ina said. "It's all so
bizarre."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Madden, chief executive officer of the USADA, said in a
statement that the sanction was appropriate but declined further
comment until the AAA panel releases its opinion.</TE>
<TE>   The national governing bodies of Olympic sports give the USADA
lists of potential testing candidates. Athletes can be tested at
competitions and during surprise visits.</TE>
<TE>   Ina, who teamed with John Zimmerman to finish fifth at Salt Lake
City and finished fourth in the 1998 Games and ninth in 1994 with
Jason Dungjen, said she has passed dozens of tests.</TE>
<TE>   Ina said the USADA representative and a companion arrived at 10:30
p.m. as she was preparing for bed. After 45 minutes, unable to
provide enough urine for a sample, she said she asked if the testing
could be performed the next day at her training rink in Hackensack,
N.J. She said the agent called a supervisor but got no response, and
a call to the USADA's 24-hour hotline was not answered.</TE>
<TE>   "She told me I had to sign a paper saying I refused to give a
sample and told me [the penalty] would be a two-year suspension," Ina
said. "Then I find out it's four years to life. There are so many
discrepancies and so many questions she didn't have the proper
answers for. I didn't refuse to sign or take the test."</TE>
<TE>   Ina and Zimmerman signed with Stars on Ice and will lose their
Olympic eligibility if they perform with the show. However, they
could have competed in pro-am competitions and other ISU-approved
events.</TE>

<LD>If Bob Toledo is seen tying a lure to a line, it will mean the
already dire UCLA quarterback situation has taken another turn for
the worse.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm going to put up a 'Gone Fishing' sign," he joked.</LD>
<LD>   As long as he's on turf, however, the Bruin coach will be
searching for a suitable replacement for senior Cory Paus, who broke
his right ankle against California on Saturday, and second-stringer
Drew Olson, a freshman who suffered a mildly separated shoulder in
the same game.</LD>
<TE>   It's possible Olson will be ready by Saturday, but the only
certainty is that a freshman will start. The most likely candidate is
Matt Moore, who watched the 17-12 loss to Cal on television from his
parents' home in Newhall.</TE>
<TE>   The injuries ended plans for him to redshirt and he took most of
the snaps in practice Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was taking the year off to get bigger and better," he
said. "I never thought anything this drastic could happen. But I'm
here to play football. I'm not here to sit. This is a great
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Another choice is John Sciarra, a redshirt freshman who completed
one of seven passes with one interception and two fumbles in the
fourth quarter against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   "Poor John was put in a really tough situation," Toledo said.
"Unfortunately, he couldn't capitalize on it."</TE>
<TE>   Sciarra discussed his performance with his father, John, a UCLA
quarterback in the mid-1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked me through things as a dad, then as player to player he
told me what I needed to do to make myself noticeable -- in a better
way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olson wore shoulder pads and played catch from five yards during
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea how it will react to treatment," he said. "It
feels a lot better already, but it's tough to put a time line on a
recovery."</TE>
<TE>   All signs point to Moore, the former Newhall Hart High standout
who spent the last two months adding weight to his skinny 6-foot-4
frame. He has gained eight pounds and is up to 185.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to get the offense down more than anything," he said. "I'm
just going to practice hard and learn as fast as I can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stanford also has uncertainty at quarterback. Starter Chris Lewis
suffered a shoulder injury against Arizona and there are conflicting
reports about its severity.</TE>
<TE>   In an afternoon conference call with reporters, Cardinal Coach
Buddy Teevens said, "I anticipate him being able to throw the
football."</TE>
<TE>   But Art Matter, the father of backup Cardinal quarterback Kyle
Matter, said that his son called him Monday evening to say Lewis is
out one to two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Matter, a redshirt freshman, was one year ahead of Moore at Hart
High. Kyle Boller of Cal is also a Hart product, raising the
possibility of three quarterbacks from the same high school starting
Saturday for Pacific 10 Conference teams.</TE>
<TE>   Matter started the opener against Boston College because Lewis was
suspended and in three appearances has completed 61.6% of his passes
for 580 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nate Fikse is competing against struggling kicker Chris Griffith
during practice this week and got off to a solid start Monday, making
seven of nine kicks from as far as 45 yards against a live defense.</TE>
<TE>   "There might be a change there," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   Fikse, a senior who is second in the Pac-10 with a 42.3-yard
punting average, has attempted one field goal in his career, missing
from 55 yards.</TE>
<TE>   However, Griffith has struggled, missing six of 14 field-goal
tries. Two field goals and one extra-point attempt have been blocked
and the low trajectory on a blocked field-goal attempt against Cal
prompted Toledo to consider Fikse.</TE>

<HD>BCS Appearance Is Right on Schedule</HD>

<LD>Coach Pete Carroll was unmoved Monday by the Trojans' first
appearance in the bowl championship series rankings.</LD>
<LD>   USC, 5-2 overall and 3-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, was rated
No. 14 based on a BCS formula that includes polls, computer rankings,
strength of schedule and other factors.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't really understand how it works," Carroll said. "That must
be some indication of the strength of schedule for us."</LD>
<TE>   USC's schedule was rated as the fourth toughest. The Trojans are
one of two teams in the BCS top 15 with two losses. Florida State,
rated No. 12, also is 5-2.</TE>
<TE>   Teams ranked in the BCS top 12 at the end of the season are
eligible for participation in the four BCS bowls -- the Fiesta,
Sugar, Orange and Rose.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac-10 champion plays in the Rose Bowl unless it qualifies for
the national championship game, which is the Fiesta Bowl this season.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, USC's opponent this Saturday, is ranked No. 15 in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After extending its home winning streak to seven games with a
41-21 victory over Washington last Saturday, USC will not see the
Coliseum for almost a month.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a special little celebration looking at the highlights of
our game because we won't be there for a while," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans, who have lost two of three road games, play at Oregon
on Saturday and then have a bye. They play at Stanford on Nov. 9
before returning home for a Nov. 16 game against Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be tough playing on the road, but I think we
learned a lot at Kansas State and Washington State," defensive
lineman Mike Patterson said. "We're going to be ready."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Safety Troy Polamalu and wide receiver Kareem Kelly, both of whom
have ankle injuries, did not participate in drills, but are expected
to practice today. Carroll would not say whether Kelly would start
ahead of freshman Mike Williams, who caught three touchdown passes
against Washington and had his third consecutive 100-yard receiving
game. "Either way, both guys will play and play a lot," Carroll said.
Kelly and Oregon receiver Keenan Howry each have caught passes in 42
consecutive games and can establish a Pac-10 record with one
reception Saturday.... Junior offensive tackle Jacob Rogers, who
missed the Washington game because of a bruised right knee, might
practice this week but is not expected to play against Oregon....
Freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua performed some agility drills
and said he hoped to complete a full practice Thursday with an eye on
making the trip to Oregon. Matua had arthroscopic surgery on his
right knee Oct. 3 and is still likely to redshirt.</TE>

<HD>Known U.S. Bali Victims Put at 7</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SURABAYA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>At least seven Americans are believed to have died in the nightclub
bombing in Bali, but the remains of only two have been identified, a
U.S. consular official said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But Thomas C. Daniels said that figure could rise because 45
Americans believed to have been traveling in Bali or elsewhere in
Southeast Asia on Oct. 12, the day of the blast, were subsequently
reported by their families or friends to have not checked in.</LD>
<LD>   The number of missing Americans was originally 170. Most have
since turned up. As for the 45, officials began telephoning families
Monday to see if there was any update -- and, if not, to ask to have
dental records or fingerprints sent for matching against remains in
the Bali morgue.</LD>
<TE>   "We do not believe that the 45 people on the missing persons list
are victims of the terrorists' bombing," said Daniels, vice consul in
Surabaya. "But if I can't take these people off the missing list, I
have to start collecting dental records and fingerprints."</TE>
<TE>   More than 180 people were killed in the blast. The Americans
confirmed dead are Karri Jane Casner of Flower Mound, Texas, and
Deborah Snodgrass, who had been living in Bali. Five other Americans,
including Steven Brooks Webster, 41, of Huntington Beach, are
presumed dead.</TE>

<HD>Deadly Blast a Challenge to Indonesia's Leader</HD>
<DH>The bombing in Bali appears to have been aimed at
destabilizing President Megawati. The question is whether she has the
will to respond.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>It was a grim scene when President Megawati Sukarnoputri
toured Legian Street in Bali. Hours earlier, a massive car bomb had
exploded, destroying dozens of buildings, killing nearly 200 people
and striking at the heart of one of Indonesia's most vibrant
communities.</LD>
<LD>   Bodies remained buried in the rubble, and the smell of smoke hung
in the air. Glass and debris from the gutted buildings were strewn
everywhere. This was Indonesia's Sept. 11, a terrorist attack that
was both psychologically and economically devastating.</LD>
<LD>   As the president surveyed the ruins, a reporter called out a
question: How did she feel seeing the destruction? Megawati responded
in characteristic style. She said nothing.</LD>
<TE>   Many young Australian tourists were among the dead, but they were
not the only targets. In many ways, the bomb was aimed at the
detached, cautious president who has spent the last year largely
neglecting the threat of terrorism in Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   No one has admitted responsibility for the bombing, but it appears
it was intended to undermine Megawati's government by attacking the
most stable and prosperous of Indonesia's 17,000 islands.</TE>
<TE>   For Megawati, who is part Balinese, the question now is whether
she has the resolve to combat terrorists and Muslim extremists who
advocate the use of violence in their quest to turn Indonesia into an
Islamic state.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a real test for her," said Dewi Fortuna Anwar, who served
as an aide to former President B.J. Habibie. "It could destabilize the
government.  Or it could work to her advantage, with everyone in the
government working together."</TE>
<TE>   During the last year, Indonesia's neighbors and the United States
have expressed concern that Indonesia was a weak link in the fight
against terrorism. Long before the Bali bombing, Megawati heard
repeated warnings that Al Qaeda terrorists were moving into this
sprawling, loosely governed archipelago.</TE>
<TE>   Only after the bombing did the Indonesian government take
aggressive action: Late last week, Megawati signed emergency decrees
allowing terrorism suspects to be held for up to six months without
charges, and police arrested radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, who is
accused of heading a regional terrorist network linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has more Muslims than any other nation, but most are
moderate and tolerant of other religions. Bali, a predominantly Hindu
island, is one of the jewels of Indonesia, maintaining its own
identity and, until now, a strong tourist trade despite the violent
conflicts that have plagued other islands.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bali bombing wrenched our emotions because it hit the
island of peace, our last hope for a turnaround in our fortunes," wrote
Wimar Witoelar, former spokesman for ex-President Abdurrahman Wahid,
in an article in the Australian Financial Review. "As the World Trade
Center symbolized technology and superiority, Bali symbolized culture
and balance."</TE>
<TE>   By attacking a popular night-life strip in Bali, the bombers
advanced the militant Muslim cause on several fronts.</TE>
<TE>   Ardent Muslims despise Western-style nightclubs, where alcohol
flows freely, foreigners get drunk, and local women, they say, are
corrupted. In recent months, groups of Muslims armed with sticks have
raided nightclubs in Jakarta, the capital, and elsewhere, smashing
bottles, breaking furniture and sometimes beating patrons.</TE>
<TE>   Extremist Muslims also resent the presence of foreigners in
Indonesia. Occasionally, dozens of militants descend on hotels in
Central Java province in the hope of scaring foreigners into leaving.
The "sweeping," as they call it, has never been very effective. But
the Bali bombing has prompted a major exodus from the country as
tourists have fled and Western embassies have ordered nonessential
personnel and family members to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Indonesia, Muslim extremists have attempted to ignite a
religious war by attacking Christians and bombing churches. The
attack on the "island of the gods" spread the violence to the Hindu
population.</TE>
<TE>   By bombing Bali, the terrorists inflicted maximum damage to the
country's economy. Tourism is one of Indonesia's most important
industries, and Bali is its showcase. Foreign investors will surely
think long and hard before they put any money into a country so torn
by violence.</TE>
<TE>   Megawati herself presents an inviting target. Muslim extremists
resent her greatly. They say she doesn't understand Islam and should
never have been chosen as president because she is a woman. Admitted
Al Qaeda operative Omar Faruq, who was arrested in Indonesia and
handed over to the United States in June, confessed that he and
fellow militants twice drew up plans to assassinate her.</TE>
<TE>   As the daughter of founding Indonesian President Sukarno, Megawati
remains popular among ordinary citizens. Until the bombing, the
country was enjoying more stability than during the administrations
of predecessors Wahid and Habibie.</TE>
<TE>   But if she mishandles the current crisis, she may find her support
eroding as she runs for reelection in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not enough to go to Bali the day after the bombing," said
one foreign businessman. "She needs to show leadership. This is the
beginning, not the end, of the terror campaign. If they flatten an
office tower, then many foreigners will run for the exits."</TE>
<TE>   One problem Megawati faces is the role played by her vice
president, Hamzah Haz, who has openly consorted with radical Muslims.
After inviting Bashir and other suspected extremist leaders to his
home for dinner earlier this year, Haz proclaimed the country free of
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no terrorists here," he said in May. "I guarantee that.
If they exist, don't arrest any Muslim clerics. Arrest me."</TE>
<TE>   After the bombing, however, Haz changed his tune. The blast was
"an act of terrorism," he said. "No one who is involved in terrorism
-- ordinary people, government officials or ulemas [Muslim religious
leaders] -- has impunity from the law."</TE>
<TE>   Megawati rarely speaks out on public issues. She prefers
to maintain a light public schedule and keep her thoughts to herself.
Last week was no different.</TE>
<TE>   Over the weekend, she had only one event on her schedule: her
brother's wedding reception. The party took place Saturday evening --
just as mourners gathered in Bali to commemorate the bombing a week
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Australian Prime Minister John Howard declared Sunday
a national day of mourning for the many Australians who were killed
in the Bali bombing. Then he addressed his nation on television and
said he was committed to fighting terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, when he visited the scene of the bombing, he hugged the
father of one victim and told him, "We'll get the bastards who did
this," according to the Sydney Morning Herald.</TE>
<TE>   Megawati might have seized the opportunity of her visit to Bali to
reach out to the public. She might have expressed her outrage over
the attack in the way President Bush did when he visited the ruins of
the World Trade Center, grabbed a bullhorn and began speaking to the
crowd. The event was a turning point for Bush and began changing the
public perception that he was a weak president.</TE>
<TE>   But for Megawati, the perception remains that she is not a strong
leader. Perhaps in times of trauma, she simply doesn't know what to
say.</TE>
<TE>   When Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer arrived in
Jakarta after seeing the destruction in Bali, Megawati greeted him by
saying, "The weather in Indonesia is very hot."</TE>

<LD>Tough policies introduced by countries trying to crack down on
illegal immigrants are worsening the fate of people-trafficking
victims by targeting them as well, a human rights group said in
London.</LD>
<LD>   Anti-Slavery International issued a report calling on governments
in 10 countries, including Britain and the United States, to improve
how they treat adults who have been trafficked.</LD>
<LD>   Elaine Pearson, the report's author, said many countries are
falling well short of providing victims with the required support,
instead putting them in the same category as other illegal
immigrants.</LD>
<TE>   More than 700,000 people are trafficked worldwide each year.</TE>

<HD>14 Killed in Israeli Bus Attack</HD>
<DH>More than 55 people are injured when a vehicle explodes,
creating a wall of flames. The suicide assault is the deadliest in
four months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA KING</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An SUV packed with high explosives pulled up to a crowded bus in
northern Israel on Monday and blew up, triggering a raging inferno
that killed at least 14 people aboard and injured more than 55,
police and witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   The attack, the deadliest inside Israel in four months, raised the
prospect of Israeli retaliation at a time when the United States has
dispatched an envoy to the region to try to calm tensions. The
Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, in telephone calls to
Palestinian journalists, claimed responsibility for the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Bus No. 841, operated by the bus company Egged and packed with
passengers as the early evening rush hour got underway, had just
stopped at an intersection outside the coastal town of Hadera when
the explosion sent mangled metal flying for more than 100 yards along
the roadway, eyewitnesses said.</LD>
<TE>   "Wounded people flew out of the bus, and the bus was in flames,"
Haim Cohen, who lives nearby and had just arrived home from work,
told Israel Radio.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said later that they believed the vehicle used in the
attack, described as a KIA 4x4, had contained more than 200 pounds of
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving paramedics and soldiers were driven back by the intense
blaze, unable to help those trapped in the bus. It was reduced to a
charred skeleton, all its windows blown out and its frame bent and
scorched.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to save more people, but the entire bus was one huge
flame," said passenger Michael Yitzhaki, who suffered minor injuries.
Ammunition carried by soldiers aboard exploded, as did the fuel tank.</TE>
<TE>   "The bullets whistled and everything blew up," Yitzhaki said.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of injured, some with grievous burns and shrapnel wounds,
were being treated at nearby hospitals. Five of those hurt were in
critical condition, hospital officials said, including a 2-year-old
girl.</TE>
<TE>   A fifteenth body found in the wreckage was believed to be one of
two suicide bombers, officials said, but the condition of the corpses
made it difficult to be certain of anyone's identity. Police were
searching for a second vehicle they believed had accompanied that of
the assailant.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's bombing came despite heavy security along the road on
which the bus was traveling, a corridor close to the northern West
Bank that has been the scene of frequent attacks, including one
similar to this one. On June 5, a car detonated alongside a bus near
Megiddo -- the biblical Armageddon, about 15 miles northeast of
Hadera -- killing 17 people.</TE>
<TE>   As darkness fell Monday, the flashing blue lights of emergency
vehicles illuminated the scene, and hundreds of paramedics, police
and soldiers scoured thin roadside foliage.</TE>
<TE>   The attack was the first deadly bombing in Israel since Oct. 10,
when a 71-year-old woman was killed by a suicide bomber near Tel
Aviv. But security officials say they have been foiling frequent
efforts by Palestinian militants to make their way to targets inside
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "We have said that the calm was only imaginary, and to my regret
we were not proven wrong," said Yaakov Borovsky, the police chief of
Israel's northern district. "The potential of terrorist attacks and
the motivation of the terrorist organizations are high."</TE>
<TE>   Radical groups redoubled their threats last week after six
Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed in a firefight
between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in a refugee camp in
the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   After the attack on the bus,  Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
immediately held security consultations by telephone with members of
his government, and Israeli officials expressed outrage over the
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   A top U.S. envoy, Assistant Secretary of State William Burns, is
due in Israel later this week for talks, but a senior aide to Sharon
said the continuing violence has left little hope for progress.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time there's an American envoy coming here with some
proposal ... the Palestinians time and again embark on the road that
leads to more bloodshed, more violence and more terrorism," said
Sharon advisor Raanan Gissin. "That's the road that they're on."</TE>
<TE>   The Sharon government has made it clear that it considers
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat a prime architect of
terror against Israel, and it refuses to have any dealings with him.
However, the Palestinian leader condemned the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Palestinian leadership is opposed to attacks against
Palestinian and Israeli civilians," he told journalists outside his
headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, according to the
Reuters news agency. "We reject such attacks against civilians."</TE>
<TE>   Israel was almost certain to respond militarily to an attack of
this magnitude. The country's Channel One television, citing military
sources, said Sharon and his defense minister, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer,
were weighing a "pinpoint" reaction rather than a widespread one.
Israel already has a tight grip on almost all the West Bank's major
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Attention was focused on the West Bank town of Jenin, about 15
miles east of the bombing site, where a tight curfew had been eased
in recent days. An Islamic Jihad cell in Jenin was suspected of
carrying out the attack, as well as the June one in Megiddo, the
Channel One report said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli security forces were on high alert in the north of the
country, particularly in areas close to the West Bank, Israeli media
said. Authorities acknowledged, however, that an attack that makes
use of a moving vehicle is extremely difficult to guard against.</TE>
<TE>   Suicide bombers traveling on foot in urban areas are sometimes
spotted by alert onlookers -- a category that includes nearly every
Israeli these days -- who are tipped off by clues such as a would-be
bomber's bulky garb and nervous manner.</TE>
<TE>   "This scenario is hard to prevent," said Moshe Waldman, a senior
police official in the Hadera region. "If a car isn't stopped at the
source, the moment it's on the road, it's almost impossible to track
it down and foil an attack."</TE>

<HD>Parts of Venezuela Paralyzed by Nationwide Work Stoppage</HD>
<DH>The strike is the latest in a series of actions by
opponents seeking to force President Hugo Chavez to resign and call
new elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>A nationwide strike to call for the resignation of President Hugo
Chavez paralyzed large parts of Venezuela on Monday, a further sign
of this country's deep internal divisions.</LD>
<LD>   Opposition leaders claimed that millions of workers stayed home
and that more than 80% of businesses shut their doors in the third
nationwide strike in 12 months.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the day, television stations broadcast images from
provinces throughout Venezuela of deserted streets, shuttered
businesses and empty buses.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike in the past, there were no reports of violence between the
opposition and Chavez supporters.</TE>
<TE>   However, traffic seemed heavier on the streets than in past
strikes, and several provinces in the country's rural interior
reported near-normal business activity, a sign of growing popular
frustration that the opposition hasn't been able to provide a
credible alternative to Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   As opposition leaders declared an end to the 12-hour strike Monday
night, they promised to deliver by next month the 2 million
signatures necessary to force a referendum on the president's rule
before the end of the year. The announcement was followed by a
30-minute cacerolazo -- thousands of Venezuelans beating pots and
pans to produce a cacophony that filled the city at nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, Venezuela showed itself and the world that it is capable
and disposed to resolving the crisis it is suffering through civil,
democratic and peaceful means," said Carlos Ortega, the head of
Venezuela's largest union. "Democratically, we have said, 'Enough.'
Enough of not resolving this crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials took to the air waves repeatedly Monday to
insist that the country was functioning normally.</TE>
<TE>   After some TV channels showed images of closed bakeries and gas
stations, Vice President Jose Vicente Rangel said that every "bakery
... and gas station" in the country was open. He estimated that only
10% of businesses were closed. He was contradicted by Production
Minister Ramon Rosales, who said the strike cost the country's
economy at least $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   One area in which the government could claim victory was the
all-important petroleum sector. Venezuela is the world's
fifth-largest oil producer, and state oil officials said production
continued normally Monday. Critics said Chavez had bought off the
workers by granting the largest oil union a 35% pay raise earlier
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Since a similar strike in April led to a coup that briefly toppled
Chavez, the president and the scattered opposition have not managed
to sit down and talk. Late Monday, police claimed to have broken up
an assassination plot against Chavez -- the second in two days.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition -- consisting of unions, business groups, the Roman
Catholic Church and the media -- wants Chavez to resign immediately
and call new elections. It cites the shrinking economy, rising
joblessness and internal strife remaining from the coup, which
resulted in dozens of deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez gets 25% to 30% support, most of it from the poor, in
public opinion polls. He has rejected the opposition's call. Instead,
Chavez says he would abide by the results of the referendum if
opponents collect enough signatures to put it on the ballot. However,
he says, according to the constitution, a referendum could not be
held before next August. Chavez's term is set to expire in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   A tour of Caracas on Monday revealed in miniature the country's
problems. While the mostly wealthy eastern end of the city was a
virtual ghost town, the poorer western sector was alive with
business.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson Ramirez, a urologist, said Venezuelans were tired of
Chavez's refusal to negotiate with opposition leaders. He said that
since the coup, he and other wealthy Venezuelans have been going to
gun clubs to make sure Chavez followers don't attempt an armed
takeover of richer neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I can hit a target across the street," Ramirez said as he
pointed across a mostly deserted plaza to a five-star hotel and a row
of closed office buildings. "Before, I couldn't have hit you sitting
right next to me."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away, in a dingy plaza in one of Caracas' poorest
neighborhoods, Ysidro Fernandez was stacking cantaloupes into a
street cart to be sold for the equivalent of 50 cents apiece.</TE>
<TE>   National guard and police soldiers stood in small bunches
everywhere, tear-gas canisters mounted on their shoulders and M-16
rifles strapped across their backs. Motorcycles, buses and taxis
zoomed by. Fast-food restaurants, street vendors and lottery shops
were all open, doing brisk business.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never voted for anyone, but I'm for Chavez," Fernandez said.
"Without him, who knows what the rich would do to us?"</TE>

<HD>U.N. Says Essential Drugs Not Sufficient</HD>
<DH>A third of all people are unable to obtain life-saving
medicines, WHO declares.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GENEVA</DL>
<LD>Life-saving medicines are not available to one-third of the world's
population despite a long international campaign for wider access to
essential drugs, the World Health Organization said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In the 25 years since WHO drew up its essential drugs and
medicines list, the number of people able to obtain those medicines
has doubled, but there remains "a huge unfinished agenda," said
Jonathan Quick, the head of the U.N. agency's project.</LD>
<LD>   "We still have 2 billion people who can't regularly get medicines
when they need them, at a quality they trust and at a price they or
their community can afford," Quick told health experts at a
discussion attended by journalists.</LD>
<TE>   The U.N. health agency's list includes more than 300 medicines and
aims to guide mainly Third World governments and health bodies on
what drugs should be available, at what quality and price and in what
dosage.</TE>
<TE>   In poor countries, where a daily income of $1 or $2 is the norm,
the burden of financing health care often falls on those who are
sick.</TE>
<TE>   WHO Director General Gro Harlem Brundtland said so-called
out-of-pocket payments by patients account for as much as 90% of
total health care spending in some poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   "For many, the reality is stark: No cash, no cure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Pecoul of Doctors Without Borders said patents,
particularly on AIDS treatments, translate into high prices, "with
the direct result that people in developing countries cannot afford
to save their own lives."</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot accept the sick logic that says he who cannot pay,
dies," he said.</TE>

<HD>Police Follow Clue in Bali Bombing to Nearby Island</HD>
<DH>An ID found at the site may point to a suspect. Police say
there were two explosive devices.</DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WANASABA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>WANASABA, Indonesia -- An identity card found at the scene of a car
bombing in Bali more than a week ago leads to a remote village in the
middle of rice paddies and coconut groves.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Fawazi, 20, is said to have lived here in the back of a
two-story schoolhouse on the eastern side of Lombok island.</LD>
<LD>   He hasn't been seen since the Oct. 12 blast ripped through the
heart of a Balinese resort town, killing and wounding hundreds, many
of them young Australians.</LD>
<TE>   People here acknowledge that police have been to the village to
ask questions. However, few are willing to tell a reporter that they
knew Fawazi, or where his relatives live.</TE>
<TE>   One man who said he was a distant relative claimed to have heard
from Fawazi's brother since the terrorist attack on Bali, which is
just west of Lombok.</TE>
<TE>   "Fawazi and his brother went to Bali for a few days for fun," said
the man. "He was standing outside the Sari Club. His brother went off
to do something else. When he came back, the bomb had gone off."</TE>
<TE>   But before the man could say more, someone shouted at him and he
hurried off, adding, "We don't know if he is alive or not."</TE>
<TE>   Officials have detained no suspects and have revealed little about
who might have committed the attack or how it was carried out.</TE>
<TE>   "We are getting a lot of information from the local papers that
say someone saw people running away after the bomb, probably because
they were running in fear," said Michael Spinks, a spokesman for
Australian police, who have joined the investigation. "We have to try
to eliminate which ones were running away before the bomb, which ones
were running away after the bomb."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, investigators released some of their findings.</TE>
<TE>   They said two bombs went off. The one in front of the Sari Club,
where most of the casualties took place, consisted of 110 to 330
pounds of an ammonium nitrate mix. At another location, Paddy's Irish
Club, about a pound of TNT was used, said Brett Swan, another
spokesman for Australian police.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb in front of Paddy's was the first one, said Brig. Gen.
Edward Aritonang of the Indonesian national police.</TE>
<TE>   But officials have not yet answered other questions, including
whether the explosions were set off by suicide bombers or by remote
control and whether there was any connection with a smaller blast
about the same time near the honorary American consulate nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they have interviewed about 67 witnesses in
Bali. At least four of them have been undergoing intense questioning
and have not been allowed to go home, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Fawazi's late father and his cousins were respected leaders of an
Islamic school here that has hundreds of students. One said Fawazi
came to it often. Another said he had gone to Japan to work. No one
wanted to comment on the Bali bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago of 17,000 islands, could be a
fertile recruiting ground for Islamic militants.</TE>
<TE>   Police are still waiting to question Abu Bakar Bashir, who has
been identified by authorities as the leader of the extremist group
Jemaah Islamiah, a charge that Bashir denies.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities accuse Bashir of helping to plan a series of church
bombings on Christmas Eve 2000 that killed 19 people across Indonesia
and of participating in a failed plot to assassinate President
Megawati Sukarnoputri last year.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir was admitted to a hospital Friday, complaining of
exhaustion and respiratory problems. He was arrested Saturday but
remained in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities think Jemaah Islamiah had a role in the Bali bombings,
but Bashir has not been charged in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir is thought to be a close associate of Riduan Isamuddin, an
extremist better known as Hambali who is thought to be a Southeast
Asia liaison for Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "It's illogical that Bashir says he doesn't know about the bombing
in Indonesia," said Matori Abdul Jalil, Indonesia's defense minister,
citing Bashir's suspected contacts with Hambali. "Hambali is the vice
president of Abu Bakar Bashir. Hambali's involved in many terrorist
acts in Indonesia."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, authorities said the site of the Bali bombing would be
reopened by the middle of this week. On Monday, they pushed the date
back to November, giving investigators more time.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish the government would catch the bad guys quickly and punish
them with a slow and painful death," said Made Suartaya, an
accountant at a Balinese hotel whose brother and cousin were killed
in the blast. "That way they would know how we feel."</TE>

<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Mexican authorities said Monday that they have arrested 22 current
and former government officials accused of giving key information
about drug investigations to powerful drug cartels in exchange for
monthly payments.</LD>
<LD>   Among those arrested are current employees of Mexico's drug crime
prosecution agency, the federal police, the attorney general's office
and the Defense Ministry, as well as former members of the military
and other former government employees. The government has seized 230
pieces of real estate, 16 vehicles and more than $2 million in cash
as part of the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "They handed over privileged information about investigations into
cartels," Mexican Atty. Gen. Rafael Macedo de la Concha said at a
news conference. He said the arrestees are accused of handing
information to the Juarez cartel and to accused drug kingpins Ismael
Zambada and Joaquin "Chapo" Guzman.</LD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Residents of a city in central Ivory Coast accused government troops
Monday of burning homes and shooting civilians in attacks that
targeted Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Muslims in Daloa, a city of 160,000 people, said the troops were
attacking members of the Dioula, a largely Muslim northern tribe, and
migrants from Burkina Faso, a mostly Muslim country to the north.</LD>
<LD>   Ivorian army spokesman Col. Jules Yao Yao said he had received
word of atrocities being committed and warned that the guilty "could
be shot on sight."</LD>
<TE>   Millions of immigrants from Burkina Faso work in Ivory Coast,
often on cocoa plantations. Some have been the target of ethnic
attacks since fighting erupted between the government and rebels a
month ago.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds have died in the fighting that split the country between
the largely Muslim north, controlled by the rebels, and the mostly
Christian and animist south, which remains in government hands. The
rebels are led by Tuo Fozie, who served in the army for 23 years and
signed a cease-fire last week. About 800 former soldiers form the
core of the rebellion.</TE>

<HD>Unsettling Return to Germany</HD>
<DH>Recession and prejudice hamper the integration of those
whose ancestors left for Russia or were trapped in the postwar
U.S.S.R.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WEISSWASSER, Germany</DL>
<LD>In the light of an Esso gas station, where abandoned apartment
buildings slump on streets named for dead heroes, a half-drunk boy
from Kazakhstan caught a sucker punch in the nose.</LD>
<LD>   Some would say Nikolai Kusnezov had it coming.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't mean to, but I was drinking and I spit out some beer and
it hit the shoes of this German guy," said the big-shouldered
16-year-old, remembering that evening in June. "I told him I didn't
want any trouble. The guy told me to 'go away.' I said, 'Why should
I?' "</LD>
<TE>   Nikolai has won his share of tiny, whirlwind battles against other
boys at the Esso. But on that night, he lay beaten on the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   "As the guy walked away," he said, "I heard him call me a 'dirty
Russian.' "</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai is not Russian. But such distinctions are merely semantics
in this east German town near the Polish border. Nikolai is one of
Weisswasser's 1,250 "resettlers," the often-resented -- and sometimes
feared -- descendants of those who generations ago fled Germany for
better lives in Russia, or were trapped inside the Soviet Union
during the tumult of redrawn borders after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   They lost much. But they kept their German heritage. Since the
Berlin Wall fell in 1989, and the map of Europe again was recast,
nearly 2 million resettlers and their relatives, scattered from
Siberia to Uzbekistan, have dusted off family albums and driven their
rusty Ladas and Trabants to claim citizenship in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Most have remained. Some have found prosperity. But over the
years, many other resettlers have discovered the land of their
ancestors to be less welcoming. This reality is especially hard on
the young, and resettler teenagers often turn to drink, drugs and
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Economic turmoil has hampered their integration throughout this
nation of 82 million. They are shackled by sparse opportunity in a
country reeling from recession and the huge cost of uniting east and
west. Nikolai sees this every day in Weisswasser, whose coal fields
were once a key energy source for the formerly Communist east but
whose unemployment rate is now a stubborn 26%.</TE>
<TE>   The resettlers raise complex questions about Germany's -- and, to
a larger extent, Europe's -- ability to cope with emerging
multicultural societies. Unlike Germany's populations of Turks and
Africans, the resettlers look like native Germans. They are, in fact,
from the same ethnic stock. Yet similarities are obscured by
differences and prejudices, and resettlers are often viewed with the
same suspicion as other immigrant groups.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking little or no German, many resettlers and the relatives
who tag along with them end up on welfare, living on the ethnically
segregated fringes of poor towns. Police and native Germans around
the country claim that resettlers are often trouble, especially
violent young men and boys who travel in gangs. This provokes
retaliation by German youths, and sometimes outbursts by neo-Nazi
gangs angry at Germany's flood of foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   In the northeastern city of Wittstock, a 24-year-old resettler
died in May after being beaten by three right-wing extremists,
including a soldier in the German army. One month later, according to
law enforcement reports, five resettlers, one of them mocking police
with a "Heil Hitler" salute, scuffled with officers and were arrested
for pummeling two German locals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had clashes like this between these two groups for 10
years," said Gerd Schnittcher, a prosecutor in the Wittstock
district. "Especially shocking for us is that 15 to 20 Germans
witnessed the latest murder and none of them are coming forward. Most
are scared of retribution. Others sympathize with the killers."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration Control</TE>
<TE>   The German government is seeking to reduce the number of all
immigrants, including resettlers and their relatives. New citizenship
and immigration regulations -- one of which stresses German language
proficiency -- have been tightened. In recent years, Germany has also
given German descendants living in former Soviet republics more than
$100 million in small business loans and job retraining grants to
entice them not to move west.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the number of those applying for resettler
status has fallen by 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The government, however, still faces the challenge of what to do
with young resettlers such as Nikolai Kusnezov.</TE>
<TE>   "Resettler youths have been pulled from their roots," said
Christian Klaembt, a Weisswasser social worker. "They've lost their
history. They don't know who they are. In the Soviet Union, they were
considered Nazis and discriminated against. Then their parents
promised them a better life in the West. But things are no better.
They're still poor. They're disillusioned. They want a piece of the
cake but can't have it. They turn to alcohol, drugs and violence.
Some start drinking vodka at 12 and 13."</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai tasted alcohol early.</TE>
<TE>   After the Soviet Union collapsed, his grandmother proved her
German ancestry and moved from Kazakhstan to the Weisswasser region
in the early 1990s. Since then, 12 of her relatives, including
Nikolai and his mother and siblings, have followed. Nikolai arrived
when he was 10. He quickly missed the freewheeling bedlam of
Kazakhstan and didn't much like the "strict rules" of German society.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, in Germany you need a license to fish," he said. "In
Kazakhstan you can go fishing wherever you want.... I haven't fished
since I've been here.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first arrived, the Germans called us dirty Russians. They
told me to go away and they beat me. The neo-Nazis came after me. I
couldn't do anything. But one day I decided to get my friends and get
revenge. There were 30 of us. We told the neo-Nazis to meet us at the
stadium by the Esso station. Fifty Nazis showed up. We beat each
other up. We had fists. They had bats. We won anyway, and now the
Nazis leave us alone."</TE>
<TE>   'Weird Twist'</TE>
<TE>   That fight and other skirmishes changed the culture of
Weisswasser's right-wing extremists.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weird twist," said Klaembt, who runs outreach activities
for resettlers. "At first the neo-Nazis tried to recruit the
resettlers. They told them, 'You are home in the Reich now.' But the
resettlers wanted nothing to do with it. There were fights. The young
Russians roughed them up good. Today, some of the extremists living
around the resettlers have stopped shaving their heads. They don't
wear their boots. They've gone underground."</TE>
<TE>   For many German natives of Weisswasser, the tensions swirling
around the resettlers are another burden in an overburdened city.</TE>
<TE>   At the Shelter, a biker hangout across from an old glass factory,
Norbert Brunzendorf, owner and bartender, thumbs through motorcycle
catalogs, looking at things he can't afford. Half of his customers
have disappeared over the last two years. The coal miners are gone.
The glass apprentices have headed west, joining the exodus that
shrank Weisswasser's population from 38,000 to 26,000 in the last
decade.</TE>
<TE>   A life preserver, like an omen, hangs from the Shelter's ceiling.
Torsten and Dominique -- neither will give a last name -- hold hands
and play pool in the back room. Torsten's head is freshly shaved. The
tiny screen on Dominique's cell phone reads "Skinhead." Someone
mentions resettlers.</TE>
<TE>   Dominique rolls her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Torsten leans his cue against the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "Those Russians are big criminals," said Torsten, a metal worker.
"They drive big cars and sleep till noon. They threaten us real
Germans. You can't even walk in the evening because of those Russian
gangs. They blackmail small children for cigarette money."</TE>
<TE>   Dominique, who wants to be a secretary for an international
corporation, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   About a mile away, through the cobbled streets and past pretty
storefronts downtown, Martin Hemmo, a Weisswasser native, lives with
resettlers amid rows of Communist-built apartments. Many are vacant,
jagged with broken windows. In a parking lot, women sift through junk
piles of chairs, couches, pots, pans and other things, searching for
something to revive. Pit bulls, some muzzled, some not, tug at
leashes, and young men with hours to kill sit on stoops gauzed in
cigarette smoke.</TE>
<TE>   Hemmo stays away from the Esso station down the street. The
"Russians" hang out there. An unemployed graphics designer, Hemmo,
20, has had his trouble with resettlers: "They threatened me for
money. I didn't give them any. Two of them beat me up. Why should I
give them money? I don't have that much. All we Germans do is
retreat, just to stay away from them."</TE>
<TE>   Weisswasser has begun a new series of programs -- costing $500,000
-- to ease tensions. There's a graffiti-streaked disco to bring
together German and resettler youths. There are community centers,
job services and joint soccer games. Mayor Helma Orosz says some
progress has been made but more tolerance is needed by both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want ghettoization," Orosz said. "But integration only
takes place in language, school and work. If those are missing, how
can you have integration?"</TE>
<TE>   Love, the Integrator</TE>
<TE>   In a small youth club near a stand of pine, teenage love has
coaxed cautious integration.</TE>
<TE>   Eugen Dino, 16, whose family resettled from Kazakhstan six years
ago, and Elfie Borchardt, 15, a Weisswasser native, share cigarettes
and a Coke amid the angry beat of an Eminem video. One month ago,
Elfie spotted Eugen in the hallways at school. She wasn't interested
in his nationality.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted to meet him," said Elfie, a thin girl with wire
glasses and red-tinted hair. She motions toward Eugen, who sits among
his resettler friends, including Nikolai Kusnezov. "Eugen is scared
to meet my father. I would go meet his family, but I haven't been
invited. There's a language barrier."</TE>
<TE>   "I know how her father feels about resettlers," said Eugen,
tugging on his ball cap. "He thinks we drink and fight. I still don't
feel accepted here. The Germans don't want me. But I'm not a
foreigner. I have German blood, just like them."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have any problems," Elfie said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really bothers us," Eugen said.</TE>
<TE>   They kiss and disappear out the door into the night.</TE>
<TE>   Nikolai smiles.</TE>
<TE>   Finished with a game of darts and bored with pool, he and his
friends leave the center, walking past the skateboarders and over the
broken pavement and worn grass, past abandoned apartments and down
the hill toward the light of the Esso station.</TE>

<HD>Trial to Begin for Man Linked to Sept. 11 Hijackers</HD>

<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>He worked in a pub and played soccer, but as he grew into his mid-20s
Mounir Motassadeq drifted toward radical Islam and became a key
player in the terrorist cell that sprang from obscurity and struck
with devastating surprise on Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   That is the composite prosecutors will begin sketching out today
as Motassadeq enters a courtroom in Germany's first trial of a
suspected terrorist linked to Mohamed Atta and other Sept. 11
hijackers. The 28-year-old Moroccan is charged with belonging to a
terrorist organization and "aiding and abetting" the murder of more
than 3,000 people at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and in
the Pennsylvania countryside. Motassadeq admits that he was friends
with Atta but denies involvement in terrorist acts.</LD>
<LD>   According to prosecutors, Motassadeq arrived in Germany at 19,
studied in the town of Muenster, traveled to Hamburg and pledged
himself to jihad. He trained in Osama bin Laden's camps in
Afghanistan and provided cover and finances to the hijackers,
becoming, authorities say, a kind of business manager for Al Qaeda
assassins.</LD>
<TE>   "Motassadeq was involved so deeply with other persons of the cell
that one simply has to conclude, 'If he wasn't part of it, then who
is?' " German Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities are monitoring the case closely. After Sept. 11,
Washington criticized German police and intelligence agencies for
failing to detect militant Islamic activity in Hamburg. German
investigators have spent the last year hunting suspected terrorists,
and the government has passed tough laws on immigration, money
laundering and militant organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The case comes as Washington is asking Germany to hand over
evidence against Zacarias Moussaoui, a French Moroccan awaiting trial
in the U.S. in the terror plot. He faces the death penalty if
convicted. German laws prevent sharing data that could lead to a
suspect's execution. This has strained relations between the
countries, but U.S. officials hope to glean important details about
the Hamburg cell from Motassadeq's trial.</TE>
<TE>   In court, Motassadeq will deliver a long statement countering all
charges, said his lawyer, Hartmut Jacobi. Motassadeq is expected to
address his relationship with members of the Hamburg cell and his
trip to Central Asia and to deny allegations that he recruited
terrorists, spoke about holy war or made anti-Semitic remarks.</TE>
<TE>   The trial, with a list of 160 witnesses, is expected to conclude
next year. If convicted, Motassadeq faces life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for prosecutors will be to convince the court that
Motassadeq was in the inner circle of Atta's cell and helped plan the
attacks. Much of the evidence suggests he knew some hijackers and
assisted them by finding apartments, paying bills and transferring
money. But he apparently was not selected to be one of the 19
hijackers, and many of those who could testify about his involvement
-- such as Atta -- are dead.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't tie him anywhere near the actual attack," Nehm said.</TE>
<TE>   Another of Motassadeq's lawyers, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said it is "very, very, very daring for the attorney
general to indict him for helping to murder at least 3,116 people ...
because of gas bills my client paid."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer said the government's case is based on circumstantial
evidence, adding, "I get the impression they need to put somebody in
prison to prove they were successful with something."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Motassadeq's turn toward extremism began after he
came to Germany in 1993 from Marrakech. He moved to Muenster, a
university city of 280,000 in the west of the country. He enrolled in
classes to improve his German. He worked in a pub and played for the
FC Gievenbeck soccer team. In keeping with the tenets of his Muslim
upbringing, Motassadeq was modest and showered after practice wearing
bathing shorts. He prayed five times a day.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Motassadeq moved to Hamburg, where he studied engineering
at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. There, he met Atta,
an Egyptian urban planning student. They prayed together in local
mosques, and when Atta left for summer vacations in Cairo, Motassadeq
moved into Atta's room in a student apartment.</TE>
<TE>   The two became close and, according to prosecutors, Atta,
Motassadeq and Atta's roommate, Ramzi Binalshibh -- who was arrested
in Pakistan in September and is now in U.S. custody -- formed the
core of the Sept. 11 cell.</TE>
<TE>   In a TV interview last November, Motassadeq, who signed Atta's
will in 1996, said he and Atta "were normal friends. That means we
are Muslims. We help each other out. We meet in mosques. We discuss
things. Totally normal."</TE>
<TE>   Between 1997 and 1998, the cell expanded and its members grew more
radical, investigators say. Investigators allege that Motassadeq
introduced two others to the group: Said Bahaji and Zakariya Essabar,
both of whom disappeared after Sept. 11. Another man, Abdelghani
Mzoudi, who was arrested Oct. 10 on suspicion of having links to Al
Qaeda, also began spending more time with cell members.</TE>
<TE>   Marwan Al-Shehhi -- a member of the cell and one of the hijackers
-- gave Motassadeq power of attorney over his bank account and other
financial matters such as paying utility bills. The bank account,
investigators allege, was funded by about $110,000 in scholarship
money Al-Shehhi received from his native country, the United Arab
Emirates. This account, police contend, was the cell's "financing
pot." When Al-Shehhi left Hamburg and enrolled in a Florida flight
school, prosecutors say, Motassadeq wired money to Binalshibh, who in
turn wired funds to Al-Shehhi.</TE>
<TE>   While his friends attended flight school, Motassadeq married and
became a father. He attended an Islamic seminar in the Netherlands,
and prosecutors allege that when he returned, he told witnesses in a
mosque that the Holocaust was justifiable and that jihad could be
used against infidels. "They want to do something again, and it's
going to be something big. The Jews will burn, and we will dance on
their graves," witnesses quoted him as saying.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq traveled to Pakistan in May 2000 with Essabar and
Mzoudi. Prosecutors say they crossed into Afghanistan, where at least
one witness says he spotted them in an Al Qaeda guest house and
training camp near Kandahar. It is there, authorities believe, that
Motassadeq and the others were instructed to provide logistical and
financial help to Atta and the other hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq denies going to Afghanistan and says he only vacationed
in Pakistan. Jacobi, his lawyer, said the witness who claims he saw
Motassadeq at the Al Qaeda camp is unreliable. The witness, a
Palestinian from Jordan, never told interrogators that he saw
Motassadeq at the camp until months after Motassadeq was arrested,
Jacobi said.</TE>
<TE>   Motassadeq never applied for a U.S. visa. Prosecutors say he
stayed in Hamburg as the "confidence man" who juggled details and
kept the cell running until Sept. 11. Jacobi doesn't think so.</TE>
<TE>   "What the prosecution has is very slim," Jacobi said. "All they
can do is prove Motassadeq knew cell members. That's it."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Has Hope for Anti-Iraq Resolution</HD>
<DH>France and Russia show resistance to the new draft, which
gives them some concessions but still contains items they had earlier
opposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The United States handed its draft resolution against Iraq to the
other four veto-holding members of the Security Council on Monday,
and despite signs of resistance, U.S. officials said they were
optimistic that they would have agreement on it by the end of the
week.</LD>
<LD>   "It's time to wrap this up," said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   After more than five weeks of negotiations in world capitals and
at U.N. headquarters, U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte gave copies
of the full U.S. proposal to the ambassadors from Britain, France,
Russia and China.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed resolution calls for a "much tougher and much more
effective" inspection system, said White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer, and "makes clear that there will be serious consequences
if Saddam Hussein fails to honor his obligation."</TE>
<TE>   The draft circulated Monday demands Iraq accept the terms of the
resolution within seven days and provide a full declaration of any
weapons of mass destruction within 30 days of its passage. Any
subsequent discovery of weapons not listed by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein would be considered a violation of the resolution, Fleischer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they fail to list, and then any are discovered, Iraq would
have again violated a resolution," he said. "We will have zero
tolerance for any violations of a U.N. resolution."</TE>
<TE>   While sticking to a tough bottom line, the draft represents an
important concession to France, which wants to ensure that the
measure doesn't trigger the automatic use of force if Iraq hampers
weapons inspections. Washington's compromise, first floated last
week, pledges that the U.S. would consult with the council before
taking military action against Iraq, although it would not have to
wait for U.N. authorization to act.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said negotiators had "made progress" in a weekend
of back-and-forth discussions between Washington and Paris, sometimes
by way of mediators in London. They said they expected to have a deal
completed by the end of this week, and would accept only minor
changes to the U.S. proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a new resolution, it will come from this text," said
a Bush administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   But France's ambassador, Jean-David Levitte, said before Monday's
meeting that the council members were divided on how tough the
resolution should be. Asked if Paris was close to agreement on the
resolution, he said: "I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   Russian diplomats also signaled that they were expecting the U.S.
proposal to compromise more than it did. The draft includes nods to
Russian demands that Iraq be guaranteed suspension of crippling
economic sanctions in return for cooperation, as well as a statement
of regret that the restrictions have caused suffering.</TE>
<TE>   But the text still contains conditions that France and Russia had
opposed, such as requiring that Iraqi experts be allowed to leave the
country for interviews. Iraq considers that provision a violation of
its citizens' rights and also a possible invitation to defect.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 elected members of the Security Council, and at times even
permanent members Russia and China, have said they felt out of the
loop. While Britain has been working closely with the U.S. on the
resolution, even crafting last-minute compromise language, Monday was
the first time Russia and China had been formally given a draft.</TE>
<TE>   The draft puts down several significant legal markers, declaring
that "Iraq is still, and has been for a number of years, in material
breach of its obligations" as regards U.N. resolutions requiring it
to disarm. It also says "false statements or omissions" in Baghdad's
weapons declaration or "failure by Iraq at any time to comply with
and cooperate fully" with the resolution will be a further material
breach. The finding of a "material breach" could be used as a trigger
for military action.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has argued that Iraq's past violations, plus the United
States' right to self-defense, are enough to justify unilateral
action against Iraq. Some Security Council members disagree.
Washington says that it is giving Iraq "one more chance" to disarm
and that if Baghdad fails to do so, the entire Security Council will
implicitly agree that the use of force is warranted by signing off on
the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough resolution," said an administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. "It's got to be one that brings
about disarmament in Iraq, and to do that it's got to be very, very
tough."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the administration finessed the question of just
how tough the United States wanted to be with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday talk show, U.S. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell
reiterated his earlier suggestions that Hussein could stay in power
if he disarmed. But President Bush, asked Monday before a meeting
with George Robertson, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
secretary-general, whether Hussein could remain Iraq's leader if he
met all U.S. conditions, said the Iraqi leader had shown no
indication that he would take such a step.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe he's going to change," Bush said. "If he were
going to meet all the conditions of the United Nations ... that in
itself would signal that the regime has changed."</TE>

<HD>Bush Draws Distinction Between N. Korea and Iraq</HD>
<DH>President defends choice of diplomacy to deal with Asian
nation's nuclear arms program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang and Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- President Bush said Monday that he would work with
Asian allies to try to persuade North Korean leader Kim Jong Il to
abandon the pursuit of a nuclear arsenal and defended the U.S.
decision to handle the crises in Iraq and North Korea differently.</LD>
<LD>   In his first public comment on North Korea since its nuclear
program was disclosed, Bush said the threat could be dealt with
peacefully. In contrast, Bush has insisted that he be given
authority, both by Congress and by the United Nations, to use force
against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Calling word of the North Korean program "a troubling discovery"
that the United States views "very seriously," the president said: "I
view this as an opportunity to work with our friends in the region
and work with other countries in the region to ally against
proliferation of serious weapons and to convince Kim Jong Il that he
must disarm."</LD>
<TE>   North Korea also suggested a low-key approach Monday, offering to
deal with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States is willing to abandon its hostile policy
toward the North, the North is ready to resolve security concerns
through dialogue," said Kim Young Nam, the state's ceremonial head of
state, according to South Korean reporters covering a four-day
North-South meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.</TE>
<TE>   Having already placed Iraq and North Korea, along with Iran, in
what the president called an "axis of evil" -- because the
administration deemed each to be pursuing weapons of mass destruction
-- Washington has been forced to explain why it has decided not to
use force against Pyongyang while holding out the possibility of
going to war against Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein is unique in this sense: He has thumbed his nose
at the world for 11 years," Bush said Monday, recounting unsuccessful
U.N. efforts to get the Iraqi president to disarm as well as "the
fact he's actually gassed his own people."</TE>
<TE>   "He has made it very clear he hates the United States, and, as
importantly, he hates friends of ours," Bush added.</TE>
<TE>   The president spoke during a picture-taking session as he met with
George Robertson, secretary-general of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea acknowledged to a visiting U.S. delegation earlier
this month that it has pursued a secret nuclear weapons program,
using enriched uranium, in violation of a 1994 pledge. Under the
agreement, North Korea was receiving heating oil and assistance in
building civilian nuclear power reactors in exchange for halting the
plutonium weapons program.</TE>
<TE>   The president is likely to push diplomatic efforts to pressure
North Korea during a series of meetings this week.</TE>
<TE>   President Jiang Zemin of China is to visit Bush's ranch near
Crawford, Texas, on Friday. The next day, the U.S. and Chinese
presidents are scheduled to travel to a resort on Mexico's Pacific
coast for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. There, Bush
is to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President
Kim Dae Jung of South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we can deal with this threat peacefully, particularly
if we work together, so this is an opportunity to work together,"
Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   On the Korean peninsula and in Washington, Pyongyang's confession
continues to raise questions about whether the 1994 pact, known as
the agreed framework, remains valid.</TE>
<TE>   Most U.S. officials and analysts say North Korea nullified the
agreement with a material breach of the deal's terms. Pyongyang said
over state radio Monday that the problems are the result of U.S.
dithering.</TE>
<TE>   Many in Washington would be happy to see the United States walk
away from the deal, which involves the delivery of 500,000 tons of
oil annually and construction of two reactors valued at $4.8 billion.
However, dropping it completely would also free Pyongyang to resume
its plutonium bomb program.</TE>
<TE>   With the current South Korean government seen as accommodating
toward the North, and the United States searching for a peaceful
solution that doesn't involve talking to Pyongyang itself, Japan is
in a position to play a key diplomatic role.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese officials have said repeatedly that they favor
negotiations, but they add that no progress is possible without an
agreement by North Korea on the nuclear issue.</TE>

<HD>China's Next Challenge: Mastering the Microchip</HD>
<DH>Seeking to enter the top tier of industrial powers, the
country is on a crash program to compete in semiconductor work.</DH>
<SE>A GIANT AWAKENS / Last of three parts</SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SHANGHAI</DL>
<LD>SHANGHAI -- Richard Chang, a devout Christian raised in Taiwan and
educated in the United States, has opened a $1.6-billion
semiconductor factory here and plans to build a church for his 3,000
employees.</LD>
<LD>   Chinese officials have displayed a cool, some would say hostile,
attitude toward foreign religions. But they have put out the welcome
mat for Chang because they desperately need his expertise.</LD>
<LD>   This communist nation has embraced capitalism and become a
manufacturing power, exporting toys, appliances and other products to
every corner of the globe. Now, government officials want China to
compete in a far more challenging arena: the making of
semiconductors, the silicon chips that power everything from cell
phones to missile guidance systems.</LD>
<TE>   The semiconductor is one of the sophisticated, high-value products
that form the cornerstone of an advanced economy. Chinese officials
believe that mastery of the 250-step production process for the chips
will teach factory managers and engineers the skills needed to lift
China into the top tier of industrial powers.</TE>
<TE>   With the single-minded determination it once focused on
ideological crusades, the government has embarked on a crash program
to develop a world-class semiconductor industry, using tax breaks,
free land and other incentives to attract foreign companies and
know-how.</TE>
<TE>   Though primitive by the standards of the United States, Japan or
Taiwan, Chinese chip making has taken a big step in the last few
years.</TE>
<TE>   A recent report by the U.S. General Accounting Office said several
of China's factories, using foreign capital and technology, are one
"generation" or less behind the world's leading semiconductor makers.
Chip technology undergoes a significant advance, entering a new
generation, every two years.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese leaders are counting on foreign technology experts such as
Chang to help them make the next leap.</TE>
<TE>   Under tight security in a cavernous building in Shanghai's Pudong
district, employees of Chang's Semiconductor Manufacturing
International Corp. work in sterile "clean rooms," producing silicon
chips with circuits as narrow as 0.18 micron, barely one-thousandth
the diameter of a human hair.</TE>
<TE>   The factory, among the most advanced in China, makes
semiconductors for companies in Japan, the U.S. and Europe. The chips
are packaged and sold under those firms' brand names and delivered to
customers in China, which put them in a variety of electronic
products.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of our proximity, it is easy for us to penetrate the
China market," said Chang, a 53-year-old engineer who is the
company's president and chief executive. "We are not the price
leader, but we offer better services in China. And performance-wise,
we are first-rate."</TE>
<TE>   China produced $900 million worth of semiconductors in 2000,
compared with $11 billion for Taiwan. But it is not only in volume
that China lags behind the industry leaders. Sophisticated factories
such as Chang's are rare. Nearly all the chips made here are of the
rudimentary kind used in microwave ovens and televisions --
"trailing-edge" technology, as it is known in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   China does not make enough even of these comparatively primitive
chips to meet the demands of its factories, whose consumption of
semiconductors is growing 30% a year. The country imports 85% of its
chips.</TE>
<TE>   "Semiconductors are the key to the information technology
industry," said Yu Zhongyu, president of the China Semiconductor
Industry Assn. "If we want to develop further, we need to have this
skill."</TE>
<TE>   Five-Year Plan</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, China's prospects in this high-tech realm
seemed poor.</TE>
<TE>   The United States restricted Chinese access to the most advanced
American semiconductor technology out of concern that it might be put
to military use. Air and water pollution made it hard to create the
sterile environment needed for chip manufacturing. Skilled
technicians and managers were in short supply, a legacy of the
late-1960s Cultural Revolution and its purges of intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   China also lacked the necessary investment capital. Building a
semiconductor factory, or "fab," involves huge start-up costs -- more
than $1 billion in equipment alone.</TE>
<TE>   To develop a globally competitive industry, China needed foreign
capital and talent. In 1995, the government set out to get both with
Project 909, a five-year plan with ambitious goals for building chip
plants and developing technical expertise.</TE>
<TE>   China lowered barriers to foreign investment and set up high-tech
zones offering free land and tax holidays. To encourage Chinese
factories to use chips made in China, the government imposed a 17%
tax on imported semiconductors and charged just 3% for those produced
domestically.</TE>
<TE>   Chip makers from Japan and later Taiwan began setting up
production facilities in China. Initially, they had to export most of
their output, so home-grown enterprises would be protected from
competition. But the government gradually permitted foreign-invested
factories to sell more of their semiconductors in China. That
attracted more foreign firms.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Motorola Inc. operates a giant semiconductor plant and a
test and assembly facility in Tianjin, a port city southeast of
Beijing. Even as it slashes jobs in other countries, Motorola has
announced plans to spend $6.6 billion over the next five years in
China, building at least 10 more semiconductor wafer fabrication
plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is making a bold dash into China," said Kirk Pond,
president and chief executive of Fairchild Semiconductor
International Inc. The American firm is building a $200-million
facility near Shanghai to assemble and test chips for sale in China.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwanese leaders feel particularly threatened by all this. They
fear that the loss of chip-making jobs will hollow out the island
nation's economy and give China leverage in their long-running
political struggle.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Taiwan barred its semiconductor makers from doing
business on the mainland, though companies found ways around the
rules. But this year, after lobbying by Taiwanese companies, the
government eased those restrictions, permitting the transfer of all
but the most sophisticated technology.</TE>
<TE>   Microsemi Corp. of Irvine, a leading supplier of chips to the U.S.
military and space programs, is among the American companies making
their way to China. Eager to expand its commercial and industrial
business, the firm has opened a factory in Shanghai, its first
outside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The factory, a joint venture with a Chinese company, makes a
specialized line of chips used in power plants and other industrial
applications.</TE>
<TE>   Raw materials are cheap, and engineers with advanced degrees and
five years of experience can be hired for less than $500 a month,
said Andy Yuen, Microsemi's vice president of international
operations. The factory produces high-quality chips at one-third the
cost of a similar product in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We chose Shanghai as a center because everything we need is
within 20 miles of our factory," said Yuen, a Hong Kong native who
oversees the firm's operations in Asia and Europe. "Raw materials,
chemicals, tooling -- you name it, they're here. And instead of just
having low-end assembly workers, we can use Shanghai as a place for
brainpower. My goal is to do 100% here, no exceptions."</TE>
<TE>   Return From Exile</TE>
<TE>   Foreign technocrats such as Yuen and Chang provide China with
something money can't buy: extensive experience in the intensely
competitive semiconductor industry.</TE>
<TE>   Chang was born in Nanjing, China, and raised in Kaoshiung, Taiwan,
where his parents moved before his first birthday. They were among
the thousands of Chinese who fled after the Communists wrested
control of the mainland in 1949.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from National Taiwan University and completing
his military service, Chang went to the United States, where he got a
master's degree in engineering science at the State University of New
York in Buffalo. He and his wife, also an engineer, went to work at
Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two decades, Chang played a key role in the
company's global expansion, helping oversee the launch of six
semiconductor factories in Asia and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   After taking early retirement from Texas Instruments in 1997, he
decided to return to Taiwan. Backed by a group of international
investors, Chang founded Worldwide Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.,
which made custom chips for the world's leading technology firms. In
2000, Worldwide merged with a Taiwanese chip maker, and some of
Chang's customers and investors urged him to start another factory.</TE>
<TE>   With $1.6 billion in funding from firms such as Goldman Sachs and
H&amp;Q Asia Pacific, a Palo Alto investment group, Chang went shopping
for a location. Officials in Shanghai offered him the most attractive
tax breaks, along with cheap land, water and electricity and a large
supply of technical talent.</TE>
<TE>   But for Chang, the critical factor was spiritual. A missionary
trapped in an engineer's body, he saw his company as a way to
strengthen Christianity in the world's most populous nation.</TE>
<TE>   "China is a good place in many aspects. The market is huge.
Manufacturing costs are competitive. The pool of talent is also very
good," he said. "But frankly, I was thinking about how I could share
God's love with the Chinese more than how I could help the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Chang traveled the globe assembling a team of chip designers,
engineers and production experts, many from the Chinese Christian
community. He offered the classic tech-company bargain: a chance to
be on the ground floor of a pioneering venture, with stock options.
To ease employees' culture shock, he is building a housing
development near the Pudong factory, with a bilingual school.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Lee, 43, gave up a good job at Micron Technology Inc. of
Boise, Idaho, one of the world's largest memory chip companies, to
join Chang's start-up as a vice president. Lee also took a
substantial pay cut. Chang pays his employees at prevailing Chinese
rates, which for top executives are 25% to 30% of U.S. salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Lee worried about tearing his wife and three sons, ages 7 to 15,
away from their five-acre spread in Boise and the friends and family
they had known all their lives. But Lee, who was born in China and
educated in the U.S., shared Chang's conviction that their native
country was poised to become a world center for chip manufacturing.</TE>
<TE>   At Micron, where Lee worked for 15 years, the Princeton graduate
played a critical role in developing products and had 115 patents to
his name. He hopes to replicate that record at Chang's company, where
he is head of memory technology development.</TE>
<TE>   "When I joined Micron, it was a start-up company," Lee said. "When
I left, there were 12,000 employees. It is hard for one person to
make a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Shou Gouping, a 40-year-old engineer for Chang's company, left
Beijing for the United States two years after the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre and did not expect to see his homeland again. After
obtaining advanced degrees in electrical engineering, Shou worked for
technology firms in Silicon Valley. He met Hai Ling, a Chinese
immigrant who had come to the U.S. to study physics. They were
married in 1998 and had a son the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Early last year, Shou's aging mother grew sick, and the couple
returned to China with their son. After a decade in the United
States, Shou said, it felt good to be surrounded by family and the
culture and language of his childhood. Though people were poor by
U.S. standards, he sensed an optimism about China's future.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, Shou and his wife reluctantly returned to
Sunnyvale, Calif. But they left their son with Shou's mother and
decided to look for a way back to China. Through a friend in Florida,
Shou heard that Chang was hiring. He took a job as a technical
manager in the firm's design service department, providing computer
support.</TE>
<TE>   Shou, a Christian, said that Chang's spiritual message resonated
deeply with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a feeling that my life should be in China, serving people
and God," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chang and his employees have had their share of frustrations,
including tussles with local officials over taxes, delays in getting
sophisticated U.S. equipment because of export controls, and a
shortage of experienced personnel.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts say the company's prospects are bright. Chang has cut
deals with industry giants such as Toshiba Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and
Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. to obtain
leading-edge technology. In return, Chang gave them an ownership
stake in his firm or agreed to produce chips for them.</TE>
<TE>   Chang's company "is successful because it has outside
connections," said Dorothy Lai, a Hong Kong analyst with Gartner
Dataquest, a technology research firm based in Stamford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months ago, Chang began holding religious services in a
rented building near his factory. He hopes to start construction soon
on a church for his employees.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time we have done something successful, I openly mention
that this is done with the Lord's blessing," he said. "At first, some
people felt awkward about this. But as they realize we really
practice our beliefs, they accept us."</TE>

<CX>   Motorola in China -- An Oct. 22 article in Section A on China's
semiconductor industry erred in stating that Motorola Inc. planned to
spend $6.6 billion to build 10 semiconductor plants in China. A
Motorola spokesman said the company would spend $1.3 billion in China
over the next four years, mostly to expand existing research and
development facilities. The company said it has no plans to build
semiconductor plants there.</CX>

<HD>SEC Likely to Charge Martha Stewart</HD>
<DH>The staff recommends civil action in the ImClone insider
trading case, a source says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan and Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Securities and Exchange Commission staffers have notified Martha
Stewart that they will recommend filing civil insider-trading charges
against the homemaking tycoon in connection with her sale last
December of shares of ImClone Systems Inc., a source said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The move marks a major setback for Stewart, who also is the focus
of a criminal investigation into the circumstances surrounding the
sale of her ImClone shares. She has steadfastly denied any wrongdoing
but has seen her public image -- and by extension, the fortunes of
her publishing and home-furnishings empire -- damaged by the
deepening scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Her friend Samuel D. Waksal, former chief executive of ImClone,
pleaded guilty last week to criminal charges in what has become one
of the splashiest insider trading cases to hit Wall Street since the
days of Ivan Boesky in the late 1980s.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC's enforcement staff this month sent Stewart a so-called
Wells Notice -- a formal notification that the staff is asking the
five SEC commissioners for approval to file civil securities-fraud
charges against Stewart, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   Under SEC procedure, Stewart has the right to file a written
response to the Wells Notice giving her side of the story. The final
decision on whether to bring charges rests with the SEC
commissioners, but the commission normally follows staff
recommendations, legal experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "By this time, the staff has checked and double-checked its facts
and feels it has enough evidence to go forward," said Houston
securities lawyer Christopher J. Bebel, a former SEC enforcement
official. "The commissioners aren't going to want to go on record
frustrating their staff's investigation."</TE>
<TE>   An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment Monday on the Stewart case.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart had no comment on Monday's developments, a spokeswoman
said. In previous statements, Stewart has denied breaking the law.</TE>
<TE>   The company she chairs, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., also
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   News of the SEC action, first reported on the Wall Street
Journal's Web site, came after the close of trading. Martha Stewart
Living Omnimedia shares rose 25 cents in after-hours trading after
closing at $7.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the SEC's civil probe, Stewart also is under criminal
investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, which is trying to
determine whether she lied about her sale of ImClone shares.</TE>
<TE>   She sold $227,000 worth of ImClone stock Dec. 27, one day before
the biotech company announced a damaging ruling from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration against its most promising cancer drug,
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   When the stock resumed trading after the ruling was announced, it
plunged 16% in a day. Had Stewart's sale come at the end of that day,
she would have received about $45,000 less for her shares.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC could seek to force Stewart to disgorge any ill-gotten
gains, which in this case would be the losses that she avoided by
selling before the FDA ruling became public, the source said. The
agency also could seek a penalty of up to three times the ill-gotten
gain.</TE>
<TE>   The commission also could seek to bar Stewart from ever again
serving as an officer or director of a public company, the source
said. That could be the sharpest penalty for Stewart, as it would
banish her from the company she founded and whose products are
synonymous with her image.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, a former stockbroker, stepped down from the board of the
New York Stock Exchange this month.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone founder Waksal pleaded guilty to six felonies, including
insider trading and bank fraud, in connection with sales of about $10
million worth of ImClone shares by his father and daughter and his
own attempted sale of shares worth $5 million--all just ahead of the
FDA ruling.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, U.S. authorities filed a civil lawsuit seeking
forfeiture of $9.7 million in four separate accounts controlled by
Waksal's family members, according to court papers filed in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Legal experts believe that the prosecutors are trying to squeeze
Waksal for evidence against Stewart. Waksal has not cooperated, but
the lead U.S. prosecutor said last week that the government is free
to bring Waksal to trial on the seven felony charges not covered by
his plea, or to file new charges against him. Prosecutors also could
use potential charges against Waksal's daughter and elderly father as
leverage to get his cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Stewart said last week that the Waksal plea had
nothing to do with their client.</TE>
<TE>   After Waksal's arrest in June, Stewart issued a statement saying
that her sale was triggered by a previous arrangement with her
Merrill Lynch broker to sell the stock if the price fell below $60 a
share. However, the broker's assistant who initially confirmed the
existence of the sales arrangement has since changed his story.</TE>

<HD>His Rise Has Been as Fast as His Fastball</HD>
<DH>Blazing speed and spirit take the Angels' Francisco
Rodriguez, 20, from dirt lot in Venezuela to the Series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Graciano Ravelo's baseball school is a long, long way from the
pristine diamonds of Edison Field and PacBell Park.</LD>
<LD>   It is a patch of yellow dirt enclosed by a rusty chain-link fence.
Towering concrete apartments squeeze from all sides. Busted cars,
drunks and dog waste fill the cracked asphalt parking lot.</LD>
<LD>   But it was here, in a corner of hope carved from a polluted city's
urban heart, that the Angels' 20-year-old wunderkind, Francisco
Rodriguez, learned to pitch in a way that has propelled him all the
way to the World Series.</LD>
<TE>   Here, he threw and threw and threw with such fervor that it
stunned those who watched the 7-year-old practice.</TE>
<TE>   Here, they first knew that Rodriguez was different.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone can be a winner, but not everyone can be a champion,"
said Ravelo, Rodriguez's first coach and the man who founded the
school 27 years ago. "Francisco Rodriguez is a champion."</TE>
<TE>   A little more than a month since leaving the minor leagues,
Rodriguez's rise from one of this city's toughest neighborhoods has
already become un cuento de Cenicienta  -- a Latin American
Cinderella story.</TE>
<TE>   Youngsters recite his accomplishments by rote: Tied Nolan Ryan's
franchise record of eight consecutive strikeouts; first major league
pitcher ever to win his first game in postseason play; first player
ever to win five postseason games before age 21; youngest player to
win a World Series game.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I have to pinch myself to see if this is real,"
Rodriguez said. "Am I really in the playoffs? Am I really pitching
almost every day? I pinch myself and it hurts, so, yes, this is
real."</TE>
<TE>   And now an entire country is watching to see whether the
right-handed reliever can maintain his stunning start.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez made his World Series debut on Sunday, entering with the
San Francisco Giants ahead, 9-8, and having already pounded Angel
pitching for 11 hits. He left three innings later, with the Angels
up, 11-9. They would survive the final inning without him, holding on
for a 11-10 victory that tied the best-of-seven-games series, 1-1,
going into Game 3 tonight in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The first three batters Rodriguez faced were out on seven pitches
-- two three-pitch strikeouts and a ground ball hit by slugger Barry
Bonds. His first 12 pitches were strikes. In all, Rodriguez faced
nine batters, and none reached base. He struck out four.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, usually reserved teammates and coaches were effusive in
their praise.</TE>
<TE>   "Explosive," fellow Angel relief pitcher Ben Weber said of his
fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "Fearless," Angel pitching coach Bud Black said of his
aggressiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "Incredible," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said of his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Unbelievable," added Angel outfielder Tim Salmon, whose two-run
home run made Rodriguez the winning pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, they use another word.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the best," said Anthony Martinez, a 10-year-old who was
fielding balls at the school on a recent weekday.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was known in amateur baseball circles but was hardly a
celebrity in Venezuela before all this. He never played
professionally here, leaving the country when he was 16 to begin
playing in the minor leagues in the States.</TE>
<TE>   "When he comes on television, we all say, shhh, shhh, there he
is," said Clarisol Gonzalez, 35, a childhood friend. "We are all
praying to God for him."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike many Latin American countries, where soccer reigns supreme,
baseball in Venezuela is second only to Catholicism as a national
religion. It is a tradition that stems from the nation's historical
links to the Caribbean, where American influence and investment have
long made baseball the sport of choice.</TE>
<TE>   There are eight top-level professional clubs in a country of 24
million -- a ratio that if applied to the U.S. would result in 80
major league teams. The local version of Little League starts
accepting players at age 4. Fans queue for hours before games -- both
amateur and professional.</TE>
<TE>   And so Rodriguez's success is more than just an inspiration for
kids wanting to make it to the big leagues. It's also a welcome
diversion for a nation suffering from profound political and economic
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   President Hugo Chavez, briefly ousted in a coup earlier this year,
is struggling to maintain order in a divided country. The economy has
faltered badly. Unemployment has soared.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball forms a part of our soul," said Felix Esculpi, 52, who
coached Rodriguez years ago. "It's part of our character -- young,
old, adults and children."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's rise began in one of this city's poor neighborhoods,
the Kennedy Section, a chaotic mishmash of brick houses that cling to
the side of a hill. The community was born from President Kennedy's
Alliance for Progress, a 1960s-era program aimed at improving living
conditions in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors recall how Rodriguez and his friends would play baseball
in the central courtyard of their apartment complex. A bottle cap was
the ball, a broomstick the bat.</TE>
<TE>   "After you've played with that, a baseball seems huge," said Kenny
Pinto, 21, one of Rodriguez's best friends growing up.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's parents split soon after he was born, and he was
raised by his grandparents, Isabel and Francisco Rodriguez. Both of
them worked, so Rodriguez was often left in the care of his three
uncles, with whom he shared a room in the two-bedroom apartment.</TE>
<TE>   "We were poor, yes," Rodriguez said. "I would wear the same shoes
for two years or three. But we always had food and we always had
love."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez handles most inquiries in English and can be charming in
talking about his hometown and family. He has a 20-month-old
daughter, Adriana, by his fiancee, Andrea. He also has 13 "siblings"
-- including his uncles, whom he refers to as his brothers. His
father has six other children. His mother has four. Rodriguez talks
with his grandmother, whom he calls mom, three or four times a week.
His grandfather, for whom he is named, died about three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure he's looking down from heaven and is real proud of what
I'm doing," Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   His uncles still live with Rodriguez's grandmother. The family
laughs often, easy and fast, when they talk about Rodriguez, who as a
boy hung around begging to play with his uncles -- 15 years older --
until they relented.</TE>
<TE>   The older boys were baseball fanatics. They played for youth
league and university teams, and religiously attended games played by
the local pro team, the Venezuelan Lions, whenever they were home.</TE>
<TE>   During his uncles' games, Rodriguez would play on the sidelines
with his own bat and ball, imitating the action. "I loved watching my
uncles," Rodriguez said. "And I wanted to play this game all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   His enthusiasm was apparent. One day, a stranger came up to his
grandmother. "You should enroll that boy in a baseball school," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   And so, Rodriguez was entrusted to the care of Ravelo, who
accepted him into his school even though his family couldn't afford
the $7 monthly fee.</TE>
<TE>   Ravelo is a big man, with big eyes staring out from behind his
glasses. He has grown old in the service of baseball. Now 68, he has
spent 48 years in professional baseball, first as a player, then a
coach, then a scout.</TE>
<TE>   He founded his school in 1975, with a simple idea: Use baseball to
teach kids to become better people.</TE>
<TE>   You could hardly imagine a less-welcoming place to play ball. The
field is bare dirt, about 150 feet to a side. A dented Quonset hut
hugs the left-field fence, where older boys practice batting to make
sure the balls don't fly into the nearby streets. Twenty-story
skyscrapers press on every side. Horns blare. Smoke belches from
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   But almost from the start, Rodriguez seemed to thrive. Ravelo
remembers a skinny kid, a little bigger than others his age. But two
things caught his attention: Rodriguez' discipline, riding the train
an hour each way three times a week to practice. And his attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always aggressive. He wasn't afraid of anything. And he
always had a positive mental attitude," Ravelo said.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez was one of thousands of kids Ravelo has coached through
the years. Only one other has made it to the majors: Miguel Garcia --
who also pitched for the Angels, for one game, in 1987. Several
others now play in the minors.</TE>
<TE>   There was never much doubt about Rodriguez' ability. He was chosen
to pitch for nearly every one of Venezuela's national teams as he
moved up from one youth division to the next.</TE>
<TE>   But Rodriguez was the best Ravelo had ever seen.</TE>
<TE>   "I always believed he was going to be great," Ravelo said.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Rodriguez demonstrated the preternatural cool that has
marked his postseason play.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez's grandmother remembers watching him pitch a game
outside of Venezuela when he was 10. The opposing pitcher was a
bigger boy who looked to her like he was almost old enough to shave.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't affect him at all. He just pitched," said Isabel
Aguilar de Rodriguez, 51. "I'm the one who suffered."</TE>
<TE>   Ravelo remembers a junior league player hitting a homer off
Rodriguez when Rodriguez was about 15. For the next at-bat, Rodriguez
bore down, focused and struck him out with three consecutive 90 mph
fastballs -- the fastest set he had thrown at that time.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the story about his signing.</TE>
<TE>   Ravelo, who scouts in Venezuela for the Texas Rangers, said he
tried to convince the team to sign Rodriguez when he was 15, a few
months before the birthday that would make it legal to do so. The
Rangers offered $150,000. Rodriguez decided instead to play one more
tournament, the Pan-American Youth Championship in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, he struck out 14 and allowed only one batter to
reach base. Venezuela lost the tournament to Cuba, but Rodriguez had
made his mark.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the trampoline," said Oswaldo Rodriguez, 36, his uncle.
"The offers started pouring in."</TE>
<TE>   In a short time, Rodriguez was in the middle of a bidding war in
which he won a $900,000 signing bonus -- the biggest the Angels have
ever awarded a foreign player -- in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, elbow and shoulder tendinitis delayed his
progress. So, too, did a lack of concentration. His powerful arm
aside, he was largely ineffective as a starting pitcher, including a
2001 season spent at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga, where he had five
wins, seven losses and allowed an average of more than five earned
runs a game.</TE>
<TE>   Then, last winter, the Angels made a key decision. They would try
him as a relief pitcher, hoping his concentration would improve if he
pitched in shorter stints.</TE>
<TE>   It worked. Between double-A Arkansas and triple-A Salt Lake City
this year, Rodriguez struck out 120 in 83 innings.</TE>
<TE>   He made his major league debut Sept. 18, pitching a scoreless
eighth inning with two strikeouts in a 7-4 loss to Oakland. Pitching
in parts of three more games in the next week, he tied Ryan's
franchise record of eight consecutive strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He has an easy, smooth but powerful delivery," Angel pitching
coach Black said after one of Rodriguez's late regular-season
performances. "The fastball comes out of his hand with so much life,
and there's such tremendous snap to his slider that it's a wipeout
pitch."</TE>
<TE>   After helping the Angels clinch their first playoff berth since
1986 -- when he was 4 years old -- he went on to help the team win
its first playoff championship in history, against the legendary New
York Yankees no less, then defeat the Minnesota Twins to win the
American League championship.</TE>
<TE>   And suddenly, Francisco Rodriguez is in the World Series. And a
folk hero. And receiving standing ovations.</TE>
<TE>   Even baseball's best player -- a foe in this World Series -- is
now reportedly an admirer. Rodriguez told his grandmother that Bonds,
whose hitting prowess leaves even the most veteran pitchers quaking,
approached him offering congratulations after Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "You did a good job," Rodriguez said Bonds told him. "You didn't
show any fear."</TE>
<TE>   To Rodriguez, it all seems so unreal. "Last year I was with my
[family] back home watching the World Series," he said Sunday. "It's
funny because I told my [grandmother], 'Hey, one of these days I'm
gonna be there.' It's kind of like a dream come true doing it the
next year."</TE>
<TE>   Back home, the Rodriguez family has trouble absorbing it.</TE>
<TE>   They have moved on from their old neighborhood to a comfortable
high-rise in a leafy district in Venezuela's wealthier east side -- a
house paid for with Rodriguez's bonus.</TE>
<TE>   That's where they were on Sunday, nervous and excited as Rodriguez
entered such a close and important game. "I was dying of anguish,"
Isabel said. "It was terrible for me, but we were also very happy
about what happened. It was like we were crazy with happiness. I
never believed something like this could happen to my [grand]son in
the World Series, as young as he is."</TE>
<TE>   Isabel and the others would like to go to the States to watch
Rodriguez play, but two years ago their visa applications were denied
by the U.S. Embassy here.</TE>
<TE>   So they settle for watching on their 21-inch color television in a
living room adorned with Rodriguez's trophies and ribbons.</TE>
<TE>   Some day soon, Isabel hopes, she will be there in person to see
him pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, how I would like to see my boy, with all those people
applauding him," Isabel said. "That would be beautiful."</TE>

<LD>Flamboyant former Louisiana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards reported to a
federal prison to begin a 10-year sentence for extorting money from
riverboat casino-license applicants.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards, 75, was a four-term governor who dominated Louisiana
politics for 30 years but faced numerous corruption charges
throughout his career. He has said he told friends and family he
expects to die behind bars.</LD>
<LD>   Edwards surrendered to authorities at a federal prison in Fort
Worth, holding a list of telephone numbers, a diary and a Bible. He
issued a defiant statement to reporters before entering jail, saying
he did nothing wrong.</LD>
<TE>   "I took no money from the state treasurer. I did not fool with the
taxpayers' money. I took no kickbacks for contracts," Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   The former governor said he spent his final day as a free man
walking his dog and eating a hamburger at a diner in Louisiana.</TE>

<HD>6 Indicted in Buffalo-Area Terror Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Six Arab American men who allegedly attended a terrorist training
camp in Afghanistan were indicted Monday by a federal grand jury on
charges that they provided material support and resources to Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants were arrested last month near Buffalo, N.Y., amid
allegations that they belonged to a sleeper cell awaiting orders from
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department's announcement that an Al Qaeda cell was
operating in New York state instantly focused worldwide attention on
the Yemeni American community in Lackawanna, a small steel town
outside Buffalo.</LD>
<TE>   Named in the two-count indictment, which also included a
conspiracy charge, were Yahya Goba, 25; Shafal Mosed, 24; Yasein
Taher, 24; Faysal Galab, 26; Mukhtar al-Bakri, 22; and Sahim Alwan,
29.</TE>
<TE>   The indictments contained no new information, aside from the
charges, but allowed prosecutors to proceed without a preliminary
hearing, where they would have been required to present some of their
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said the men would plead not guilty at an
arraignment today in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, they could face a maximum of 25 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   James P. Harrington, who represents Alwan, the only defendant to
be granted bail, said defense lawyers now face a collective decision:
how to investigate the government's charges.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he noted, each of the lawyers needs to look
after the interests of the person he represents.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as we have common interests, we will stick together,"
Harrington said. "But each person has to individually represent their
own clients."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors did not return calls for comment after the indictments
were made public.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters claim that the defendants are victims of anti-Muslim
propaganda and have sought to frame the case in the context of a key
test of the Bush administration's prosecution of terrorism suspects.</TE>
<TE>   In a preview of the prosecution's strategy for a trial not
expected until sometime next year, government lawyers charged that
the defendants clandestinely traveled halfway around the world to
participate in a camp run by Bin Laden's organization.</TE>
<TE>   Court papers previously filed by the government said staff members
at the Al Farook camp near Kandahar tried to recruit suicide bombers,
and that Bin Laden lectured at the facility on June 6, 2001, that
"there is going to be a fight against Americans."</TE>

<HD>Public College Costs Show Sharp Increase</HD>
<DH>Four-year schools' tuition and fees rise nearly 10% in a
year, putting the yearly average at $9,663, with room and board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Trounson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's four-year public colleges and universities increased
tuition and fees by nearly 10% this year, the steepest rise in a
decade, according to a survey released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The tuition hikes were accompanied by a 6% increase in the charges
for room and board, raising the average cost of attending a four-year
public school to $9,663, the nonprofit College Board reported in its
annual cost survey. That is up $672 from last year.</LD>
<LD>   The increases come in response to a sluggish economy, which has
tightened states' revenue and shrunk endowments.</LD>
<TE>   Public colleges in California, while raising rates for
out-of-state students this year, held them steady for residents.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, private four-year colleges saw increases as well,
although less dramatic than those at public schools. Tuition climbed
an average 5.8% to $18,273, and room and board charges rose 4.6%, to
an average of $6,779.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the average cost of enrolling at the nation's top private
schools remained far higher. Harvard University raised its tuition
and fees $1,369 to $27,130 this year, officials said. With room,
board and other expenses, the total cost of attending the school rose
to $35,950, up 4.9% from last year, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Private institutions in California were about the same, with
Stanford University's tuition and fees up 4.9% to $27,204.</TE>
<TE>   But others had more significant increases, among them Claremont
McKenna College, where tuition rose more than 7% this year to
$26,160, up from $24,540 last year. Officials said the school's
tuition had been lower than many similar institutions and that they
do not expect similar increases in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, college costs have generally outstripped the rate
of inflation, but higher education officials said they were troubled
by the size of the increases this year, especially at public schools,
which educate about 80% of the nation's college students.</TE>
<TE>   The new report "confirms what we know too well: that the poor
performance of the economy has had a substantial and negative impact
on tax revenue and endowments, and consequently college tuitions,"
said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education,
which represents 1,800 colleges and universities.</TE>
<TE>   California, generally considered the nation's leader in providing
low-cost public education to its residents, was a major exception to
the trend.</TE>
<TE>   Although both the University of California and California State
University systems increased tuition about 15% this year for
nonresident students, the costs for residents -- the great majority
of students at the two systems -- remained the same.</TE>
<TE>   The $4,224 for fees for California residents enrolled at UCLA were
down slightly from last year. The overall cost of attendance,
including room and board, was about the same as last year, about
$13,000.</TE>
<TE>   California residents attending one of Cal State's 23 campuses pay
fees that vary slightly, depending on which campus they attend. But
they generally will pay about $1,900 this year in university and
campus fees, the same as last year, according to spokeswoman Clara
Potes-Fellow.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the recent increases, College Board officials emphasized
that higher education is still affordable for most Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Relatively few students actually pay full price, they noted, with
tuition discounts and financial aid available to low-income and many
middle-income students.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of aid available to students," said Sandy Baum, an
economics professor at Skidmore College in New York who served as a
consultant on the College Board study. "While college is expensive,
it's manageable in some way for almost everyone."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, College Board officials said, almost 40% of American
college students attend schools whose tuition and fees are less than
$4,000 a year; 70% attend schools that cost less than $8,000 in
tuition and fees.</TE>
<TE>   The College Board also reported that financial aid available to
students reached record levels again this year -- $90 billion. But
much of the aid comes in the form of loans, instead of grants,
leaving many students burdened with debt for many years after they
leave school. And scholarships, long directed at needy students, are
increasingly being awarded on the basis of achievement instead of
financial hardship.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, College Board President Gaston Caperton urged parents
and students not to be discouraged by the latest increases or other
difficulties in affording college. Those with a college education, on
average, earn about $1 million more in their lifetimes than those
without, he said.</TE>

<HD>Death Penalty Divide Still There</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court revealed deep divisions over the death penalty
Monday as justices used unusually strong language regarding the
constitutionality of executing people who killed when they were
juveniles and about exceedingly long waits on death row.</LD>
<LD>   The high court declined to hear two capital murder cases: one for
a man given the death penalty for a killing he committed when he was
17 and the other for a man who has spent nearly three decades waiting
to die.</LD>
<LD>   The court split along traditional lines, with the four more
liberal justices saying the court should continue a reexamination of
the death penalty begun last year when it banned executions of the
mentally retarded. The four said it was "shameful" to execute
juvenile killers.</LD>
<TE>   "The practice of executing such offenders is a relic of the past
and is inconsistent with evolving standards of decency in a civilized
society," wrote Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justices David
H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.</TE>
<TE>   No justice wrote separately to defend the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Breyer filed a separate opinion to say the court should consider
whether it is unconstitutional to leave inmates on death row for an
extended time.</TE>

<HD>The Control of Congress May Be Cliffhanger</HD>
<DH>Close races and slim majorities on Capitol Hill could spur
struggles for Senate, House leadership reminiscent of 2000 vote
nail-biter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Two years after a vote-counting dispute delayed the
outcome of the presidential election, this year's battle for control
of Congress is so close that it, too, could run deep into overtime.</LD>
<LD>   Several scenarios could lead to post-election day suspense in the
House and Senate.</LD>
<LD>   If Republicans lose a handful of House seats on Nov. 5, the fate
of their slim majority could come down to a special election in
Hawaii, a party-switching drama in Texas or a runoff election in
Louisiana on Dec. 7.</LD>
<TE>   If Democrats and Republicans fight to a draw in the Senate, the
winner in that chamber also could depend on a Louisiana showdown.</TE>
<TE>   Yet another possibility: Republicans could erase, at least
temporarily, the current one-seat Democratic majority in the Senate
if their candidate in Missouri ousts Democratic Sen. Jean Carnahan.
The term for Carnahan, who was appointed to replace her deceased
husband, is due to expire immediately after the election, and the
winner could be sworn in days later.</TE>
<TE>   If it is Republican Jim Talent -- and the race is a tossup --
control of the Senate would flip for the second time in this Congress
and the GOP would be in the majority when lawmakers gather in
mid-November for a lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   Then, astoundingly, it could switch again when the new Congress
convenes in January if other Democratic Senate candidates do well on
Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Got it straight? If not, you're not alone. Some of the sharpest
strategists on Capitol Hill didn't think through the full
implications of a Talent victory until a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) acknowledged the other
day that he might have to cede his post to the Republican leader,
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, for a few weeks if Carnahan loses.
But naturally, he insisted she would probably win.</TE>
<TE>   All of this potential confusion reflects a deep, stubborn partisan
split in America that has left both houses of Congress with their
slimmest majorities in decades -- and with neither party having a
clear edge heading into the elections.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have an extremely competitive situation," said Larry J.
Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. "You still
have the possibility of a hung election. It is not a probability, but
it is a serious possibility."</TE>
<TE>   The chances of a cliffhanger election in 2002 are rooted in the
election of 2000. That year, as Republican George W. Bush defeated
Democrat Al Gore for the presidency on the strength of a 537-vote
triumph in Florida, several elections in both houses of Congress also
were nail-biters.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate was split 50-50 between the two major parties after
Democrat Maria Cantwell ousted GOP incumbent Slade Gorton in
Washington state in a contest whose outcome was not official until
weeks afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, through the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Dick
Cheney, held a tenuous grip on the chamber through May 2001. But
Democrats seized power after Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont quit
the Republican Party to become an independent.</TE>
<TE>   In the House, Republicans held power after the 2000 vote in part
through winning a handful of agonizingly close contests. In Michigan
and Minnesota, two GOP candidates triumphed by fewer than 200 votes
each.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican majority now stands at 223 seats, with Democrats
holding 208. Three seats formerly held by Democrats are vacant
because of a resignation (Tony P. Hall of Ohio), an expulsion (James
A. Traficant of Ohio) and a death (Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii). One
member of the House, independent Bernard Sanders of Vermont, usually
votes with the Democrats and would be counted as a vote for a
Democratic speaker.</TE>
<TE>   A feverish game of intrigue over who becomes the next House
speaker in the 108th Congress would begin if the Nov. 5 elections
leave either party at or near the magic number needed for a majority:
218.</TE>
<TE>   Suppose Democrats claim 217 seats after election night. They still
would have a shot at toppling the GOP if they have managed to force a
runoff in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District, which is being
vacated by a Republican incumbent running for the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana law allows multiple candidates, regardless of party
affiliation, to seek office. And the top two vote-getters, regardless
of party affiliation, meet in a runoff if no one captures more than
50% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists in both parties say Democrat Rodney Alexander has a
good chance of landing in a runoff in the 5th District against one of
three Republicans seeking the seat. Whoever emerges as the Republican
candidate in a runoff would probably be favored, but suppose
Alexander won in an upset. Democratic House majority, right? Not
necessarily. Republicans could have at least two counter-moves.</TE>
<TE>   First, they could ask Ralph M. Hall (D-Texas) to cross the aisle
in support of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). Hall, an
11-term veteran who voted for the Bush tax cut last year, is one of
the most conservative members of his party and has been quoted as
saying he would support the most conservative candidate for speaker.
His threat, if true, would not be viewed as idle: Hall once refused
to support Democrat Thomas P. "Tip" O'Neill of Massachusetts for
speaker.</TE>
<TE>   Second, Republicans could try to wrest from the Democrats the seat
Mink held until her death last month.</TE>
<TE>   The late congresswoman's name will appear on the Nov. 5 ballot,
and she is expected to win.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans might try to mount a strong challenge in a
follow-up special election to be held in January if control of the
House depended on it.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, Louisiana again is the focus of postelection
attention. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) is leading three Republicans and two
Democrats in her bid for reelection, but polls show her hovering
around the 50% mark. If she fails to capture a majority, she would be
drawn into a runoff.</TE>
<TE>   If control of the Senate hinged on the result of that runoff, it
probably would be a barn-burner.</TE>
<TE>   All eyes would be on Louisiana until the Dec. 7 finale, much as
the nation was riveted on Florida two years before. Both parties
would pour money and resources into the state. The White House would
spare no effort to oust Landrieu.</TE>
<TE>   Still one more postelection twist may lurk in the Senate. If Sen.
Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska) wins his race for governor, he would be
inaugurated Dec. 2 -- when a lame-duck Congress still could be in
session. Senate Republicans would lose his vote for five days, the
minimum time under state law he would have to wait before naming a
GOP successor.</TE>

<HD>Court Lets Stand Ruling for Ex-Gang Member</HD>
<DH>Justices say man has free-speech right to help Arizona
youths form an outlaw group.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A former California gang member has a free-speech right
to teach an Arizona group how to set up its own street gang, under a
ruling the Supreme Court let stand Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The justices turned away an appeal from Arizona prosecutors who
sought to revive a 15-year prison term given the former gang leader.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona law makes it a crime to advise or direct a criminal
enterprise, and prosecutors used this law against Jerry McCoy, who
was on parole when he moved to Tucson after leaving a gang in
California.</LD>
<TE>   They cited evidence that he advised younger gang members there on
how to operate a gang to ensure loyalty among recruits. He also
advised them about using spray paint to "tag" buildings and mark
turf.</TE>
<TE>   A jury convicted McCoy, and the state courts upheld the
conviction. But in February, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
threw out the conviction and ruled that the 1st Amendment protects
the "mere abstract advocacy of lawlessness."</TE>
<TE>   Although the 9th Circuit is known as a liberal bastion, the ruling
in the McCoy case was written by Judge Diarmuid O'Scannlain of
Portland, Ore., and joined by Judge Alex Kozinski of Pasadena, both
of whom were Reagan appointees.</TE>
<TE>   "Advocacy of illegal action at some future time" cannot be made a
crime, O'Scannlain said, citing Supreme Court rulings.</TE>
<TE>   Since the days of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, the court has
said the 1st Amendment protects speech up to the point it creates a
"clear and present danger" to incite violence or lawbreaking.</TE>
<TE>   But recently, the reach of free-speech protection has been debated
anew in cases involving terrorism and abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit on a 6-5 vote upheld a huge damages verdict
against anti-abortion activists whose "wanted posters" on the Web
were seen as a threat to doctors, not mere advocacy against abortion.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenters said the Internet postings did not create an
imminent threat of violence.</TE>
<TE>   In terrorism cases, government lawyers have said that those who
advocate violent attacks or "jihad" are not protected from
prosecution by the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   In the Arizona case, Justice John Paul Stevens faulted his
colleagues for "glibly" labeling as free speech the giving of advice
and training to violent lawbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   The 1st Amendment should not be read as shielding advocacy that
"may create significant public danger," Stevens said, and he urged
the court to take up a future case to clarify the law.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Rape Case Delayed 6 Weeks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>NEW YORK -- Amid protests of conspiracy and cover-up, a judge Monday
gave prosecutors six more weeks to determine whether the convictions
of five men accused of raping and beating a Central Park jogger
should be overturned.</LD>
<LD>   State Supreme Court Justice Charles Tejada said he was "not
unconcerned" about recent DNA tests suggesting that a convicted
rapist -- and not the five black youths arrested in the notorious
1989 crime -- was guilty of the attack on the 28-year-old white
woman.</LD>
<LD>   But Tejada said he would give Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert
Morgenthau until Dec. 5 to conduct an exhaustive review of the case
because "fairness and justice demand that both sides be granted
enough time." At that time, Tejada indicated, he would be prepared to
rule on a motion by defense attorneys to set aside the original
convictions.</LD>
<TE>   The judge's decision after the brief hearing, while not
unexpected, sparked angry comments by family members and lawyers of
the five Central Park defendants, who have served their time and are
now adults.</TE>
<TE>   "The only crime they committed was being black and Latino in
Central Park," said attorney Roger Wareham, "and apparently there's
two standards for justice in New York City. If you're white in
Central Park, you're engaged in legal activity, but if you're black,
Latino and young, you must be doing something illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Others accused Morgenthau's office of trying to cover up new
developments in the case, which sparked racial tensions in New York
13 years ago and helped pave the way for major anti-crime programs.
They said the evidence exonerating the five defendants is clear, and
there should not be more delays in setting aside the convictions.</TE>
<TE>   "How much more of this can we take?" said Angela Cuffee, sister of
Kevin Richardson, who was convicted of the crime along with Antron
McCray, Raymond Santana, Yusef Salaam and Kharey Wise. "It's like
they're trying this case all over again. Like they're covering up
something."</TE>
<TE>   New York was rocked by the attack on the jogger, who was raped,
savagely beaten and left for dead on April 19, 1989. When she was
discovered at the bottom of a muddy ravine, the woman had lost 80% of
her blood. Although she was in a coma for 12 days, the former Salomon
Brothers investment banker recovered. She cannot remember details of
the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Police rounded up several suspects that night, during which a
group of about 30 young men had been roaming through the northern
section of the park, beating up and harassing at least eight other
people. Their marauding attacks introduced the term "wilding" into
the national vocabulary. Investigators eventually charged five boys,
none older than 16, with the attack on the jogger. All were convicted
the following year.</TE>
<TE>   The case resurfaced this year when Matias Reyes, 31, a convicted
serial rapist, told officials that he alone had raped the jogger.
Reyes, who is serving 33 years to life for the rape and murder of a
pregnant woman, cannot be prosecuted for the jogger attack because
the statute of limitations has expired.</TE>

<HD>Dialogue With Police Heightens Sniper Mystery</HD>
<DH>Serial killers have long shown an interest in communicating
with authorities. The gunman may get a thrill out of staying ahead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Peterson and Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON A hand-scrawled note. A taunting letter. A chilling
signature left at the scene of the crime.</LD>
<LD>   The unpredictable sniper who has terrorized the Washington area
with a random series of fatal shootings now shares at least one trait
with other notorious killers: He has gotten in touch with his police
pursuers.</LD>
<LD>   The startling development may provide the most revealing look yet
into the mind of the elusive gunman who has killed nine and wounded
three since Oct. 2, criminal experts said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   "All of these things are designed to maximize the killer's feeling
of power, superiority, relative to the community and the police,"
said Jack Levin, director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and
Conflict at Northeastern University in Boston, alluding to the
bizarre calling cards, notes and taunting messages that serial
killers sometimes leave behind.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-area sniper may get a thrill out of communicating
with police, perhaps enjoying the added attention even as he stays
one step ahead of his pursuers, experts said. The dialogue also may
give him a feeling of power as he forces law enforcement authorities
to address him with respect and care.</TE>
<TE>   Some serial murderers may simply take pleasure in taunting the
cops: "The killer is saying in effect: 'See, I'm better than you,' "
said Robert Castelli, who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal
Justice in New York and is a former investigator for the New York
State Police.</TE>
<TE>   Washington-area police revealed little on Monday about what the
sniper was saying but publicly acknowledged that he may have tried to
reach them in a garbled phone call. In an extraordinary moment Monday
afternoon, Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose
tried to speak directly to the killer.</TE>
<TE>   Looking calm and stern, Moose peered into the television cameras
and recited the same message twice: "The person you called could not
hear everything that you said. The audio was unclear and we want to
get it right. Call us back so that we can clearly understand."</TE>
<TE>   The first signs of a conversation emerged on Sunday, when Moose,
during a news briefing, told an unidentified person to "call us." In
an earlier appearance on Monday, the chief announced cryptically: "We
are preparing our response at this time."</TE>
<TE>   The phone call followed a note on a tarot card believed left by
the sniper after he shot a 13-year-old boy in front of his school:
"Dear Mr. Policeman, I am God."</TE>
<TE>   Some believe it is no coincidence that the sniper may have tried
to reach Moose, out of the scores of law enforcement personnel
involved. Since the shootings began, the earnest, sometimes
short-tempered police chief has, thanks to his frequent television
appearances, symbolized the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the time, perpetrators will want to establish
communication with that [visible] person," noted Reid Meloy, a
criminal profiler in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Serial killers have long been fascinated by symbols of authority.
Jack the Ripper sent bloody clothing to a London newspaper and
contacted a local citizens committee.</TE>
<TE>   In Northern California, the Zodiac killer sent eerie letters to
the press taunting detectives about his shootings. "Son of Sam" David
Berkowitz mailed notes to the New York City police and to one of the
city's leading newspaper columnists, Jimmy Breslin.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Lee Dillon, who was convicted of five sniper killings in
Ohio from 1989 to 1992, once mocked his pursuers in a letter to the
newspaper: "You could interview till doomsday everyone that Jamie
Paxton [the victim] ever met in his life, and you wouldn't have a
clue to my identity."</TE>
<TE>   Some said Monday that killers who contact the police might be
driven in part by an urge to confess. But others maintain that the
taunting aspect and the thrill of the contest between hunter and
hunted are more typical incentives.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing the personalities of these individuals {mdash} they are
much too psychopathic and narcissistic to have any remorse or regret
about what they're doing," Meloy said.</TE>
<TE>   The desire to communicate may increase with time, adding to the
gratification of the killings like a high-wire balancing act: "At
some point in time it has to move to the next level, because it's
just like a narcotic," said Arnett Gaston, a clinical psychologist
and member of the department of criminology and criminal justice at
the University of Maryland. "You build a tolerance level and need to
move to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   A memorable example is the self-named Zodiac, who may be
responsible for 37 deaths in the Bay Area in the 1960s and 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   "The police shall never catch me, for I am too clever for them,"
the killer wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle in 1969. The writer
went on to boast that "as of yet I have left no fingerprints behind
me contrary to what the police say." He even revealed some of his
operational secrets, saying that he coated his fingertips with
airplane cement to hide fingerprints and that he had bought his
"killing tools" by mail order so they would be hard to trace.</TE>
<TE>   "So as you see the police don't have much to work on," he boasted.</TE>
<TE>   While Zodiac has not been caught, the urge for publicity led to
the downfall of Theodore J. Kaczynski, who killed three people and
injured more than 20 during an 18-year series of mail bombings.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, he promised to stop his attacks if the Washington Post or
the New York Times published his 35,000-word treatise on the
inhumanity of industrial society.</TE>
<TE>   The two papers published the manifesto. But among the readers was
Kaczynski's brother, David, who alerted authorities that it reminded
him of letters Theodore had written.</TE>
<TE>   Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, is serving four life sentences
at a federal prison in Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   Police chief: `We do want to talk to you'</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose, head of the
task force investigating the Washington-area sniper, has attempted to
deliver messages to the person who left a message and a phone number
at the scene of the latest shooting, a Ponderosa restaurant in
Ashland, Va. His statements:</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference Sunday: "To the person who left us a message
at the Ponderosa last night. You gave us a telephone number. We do
want to talk to you. Call us at the number you provided. Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   In a news conference Monday morning: "The message that needs to be

received. We are preparing our response at this time."</TE>

could not hear everything that you said. The audio was unclear and we

<HD>Justices Bolster Beach Access</HD>
<DH>Supreme Court rejects landowner claims of unfair property
seizure. California officials can now seek public paths agreed to
before 1987.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage and Kenneth R. Weiss</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for California coastal
officials to open more than 1,200 pathways to the beach, as the
justices rejected claims that the public walkways violate private
property rights.</LD>
<LD>   The court's action represents a victory for officials in Santa
Barbara County and other coastal communities who have moved recently
to take advantage of past offers by property owners to allow public
pathways across their land.</LD>
<LD>   "This is very significant. It clearly confirms our position that
if you agreed to a public access condition when it was legal to do
so, you can't get out of it now," said Peter Douglas, executive
director of the California Coastal Commission in San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   On California beaches, where all land below the high tide line is
public, the fight has been over the "dry sand," which can be owned as
private property. The Coastal Commission for years has been pushing
to open public walkways across the sand that were promised long ago
by property owners.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's Supreme Court action is expected to clear the legal
barriers to opening those public access ways. Most of them run along
the shore; others are walkways from public roads to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   The legal battles over these walkways have centered on exclusive
beach communities in Malibu, Laguna Beach, Mendocino and Santa
Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Until Monday, it had been unclear whether the high court would
allow officials to enforce agreements made before 1987 in which
property owners were forced to make "offers" of public access in
exchange for building permits.</TE>
<TE>   Before 1987, the California Coastal Commission routinely demanded
such offers when landowners sought to build near the coast. If the
owners wanted to build -- even just to add a deck or a sunroom on a
house -- they had no choice but to offer a strip of their land for
public access.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court in 1987 took up a property-rights complaint
from a Ventura homeowner named James Nollan and condemned the state's
demands as "an out-and-out plan of extortion."</TE>
<TE>   The Nollan ruling strictly limited the state's authority to seek
new "offers to dedicate" land, but it did not clarify the status of
past offers.</TE>
<TE>   Most of these offers had gone unused.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the California Coastal Commission pressed local
officials to take advantage of them. As of 1995, only one in five of
the 1,269 potential access ways to the beach had been secured for
public use, the commission said.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, these pathways must be operated by a county, park
district or nonprofit group that will assume the cost of maintaining
the land. They must add steps, install signs and take on the
potential liability from accidents or injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Coastal Commission also pointed out that many of the "offers
to dedicate" lasted for 20 years and would expire soon if officials
did not take action.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors
moved to take advantage of several such offers. However, they were
sued by two new landowners who asserted that the county's demands
were unconstitutional. The plaintiffs relied on the Nollan ruling.</TE>
<TE>   One suit was filed by Ann Daniel and Leonard Hill, who in 1997
purchased a single-family home near the beach. The previous owner had
agreed to allow a 5-foot-wide pathway across the property, but it has
yet to be built.</TE>
<TE>   The second was filed on behalf of Wendy McCaw, a billionaire
environmentalist and owner of the Santa Barbara News-Press newspaper,
who sought to block the public's use of a 500-foot strip of beach
below her 25-acre bluff-top estate. In 1980, the previous owner of
her land had pledged to allow the beach access in exchange for a
permit to build a sunroom and a deck on a guest house.</TE>
<TE>   The courts in California rejected the two lawsuits and ruled that
the new owners must abide by the promises made by the previous
owners.</TE>
<TE>   They then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been far
more friendly to property rights claims than California courts.</TE>
<TE>   Their lawyers urged the high court to block "flagrant evasions of
the constitutional restrictions" that were set in the Nollan case.
California officials should not be rewarded for having used
"strong-arm tactics" in the past to obtain private property, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless this Court grants review, the unconstitutional taking of
coastal property that occurred in this case will not be an isolated
incident. Literally hundreds of other offers ... that the Coastal
Commission coerced before the Court's decision in Nollan are due to
expire soon, and the Commission has made clear its intention to
secure acceptance of as many as of them as possible," Washington
attorney Carter Phillips told the justices in one of the appeals.</TE>
<TE>   But after studying the cases for several weeks, the justices
dismissed both of them Monday in a pair of one-line orders. (Cole vs.
Santa Barbara and Daniel vs. Santa Barbara)</TE>
<TE>   The justices did not explain their decision, but they have been
wary of upsetting existing agreements in land-use cases.</TE>
<TE>   McCaw, who does not grant interviews, issued a statement saying
she is "disappointed about the court's nondecision. My hope is the
U.S. Supreme Court will come around as it did with civil rights and
stop the California Coastal Commission from expropriating private
property."</TE>
<TE>   The easement in McCaw's case runs along the dry sand below an
80-foot bluff in the exclusive Hope Ranch community, just up the
coast from Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly a victory for public access," said Alan Seltzer, an
attorney for Santa Barbara County. "The court's decision upholds that
you leave final actions final. You don't get a second bite at the
apple."</TE>
<TE>   In a related case that has garnered much attention, movie and
record producer David Geffen has engaged state officials and a
nonprofit group, Access for All, in a legal dispute over a public
walkway along his Malibu estate. He pledged to open the walkway to
the beach in 1983, when he expanded his compound.</TE>
<TE>   Now he wants the beach, which is walled off from the public by a
phalanx of houses, to remain closed because it lacks the parking,
lifeguards and bathroom facilities necessary to accommodate the
public.</TE>
<TE>   Government lawyers said Monday's high court decision undercuts
Geffen's legal position.</TE>
<TE>   "He is raising the same issue as the others. He agreed to the
condition to get a permit. He got the permit and now he wants to get
out of it," said Douglas of the Coastal Commission. "The Supreme
Court decision is so important because it says you should have
challenged this within 60 days, not 19 years later. It should moot
out Geffen's lawsuit."</TE>
<TE>   Geffen lawyer Steven A. Amerikaner disputed that assessment.
"There are many claims in the Geffen lawsuit that were not presented
to the Supreme Court and we believe they are well-founded and
viable."</TE>

<HD>Menacing Note Heats Up Police Pursuit of Sniper</HD>
<DH>Authorities continue contact via the media with person who
left letter at shooting scene. Men held in Richmond are not tied to
the case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun and Josh Meyer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Police hunting for the ghostly Washington-area sniper conducted a
delicate, coded public dialogue with him Monday, spurred by a
threatening letter left at the scene of his most recent shooting.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation lurched over a dizzying turn of events as
heavily armed Virginia police swooped down on a white van during a
morning stakeout at a Richmond gas station. For several tense hours,
police raised hopes that the arrest of two men had finally ended the
sniper's rampage. But by day's end, authorities concluded that the
men had nothing to do with the case and turned them over to
immigration officials.</LD>
<LD>   Federal forensic analysts confirmed Monday that a highway traveler
seriously wounded in a shooting in Ashland, Va., on Saturday night is
the roving gunman's 12th victim. Search teams found a note in dense
woods near the shooting scene and investigators said the gunman
appeared to be the author of the threatening screed, written in
threadbare English.</LD>
<TE>   The sniper's latest victim, a 37-year-old man whose name has not
been released, was in serious condition at the Medical College of
Virginia Hospital after surgeons removed parts of his stomach, spleen
and pancreas. Doctors also removed and gave police a .223-caliber
bullet fragment that linked this shooting to the others in the
Washington area. The sniper has killed nine people and wounded three
since Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Signaling that authorities had been in halting telephone contact
with the presumed sniper at least twice since the letter was found,
Montgomery County, Md., Police Chief Charles A. Moose asked for a
third chance.</TE>
<TE>   "The person you called could not hear everything you said," Moose
said in a televised plea late Monday afternoon. "The audio was
unclear and we could not get it right. Call us back so that we can
clearly understand."</TE>
<TE>   Moose and other investigators would not divulge their discussions
with the killer. But several officials and former police
investigators described the hidden dialogue as a fragile dance
designed to draw the sniper out and learn more about his mental
state, while scrutinizing his letter for any traces of physical
evidence that might be used to track him down.</TE>
<TE>   "They're trying any way they can to kick this investigation up to
the next level," said Joe Vince, a former chief of the Crime Gun
Analysis Branch at the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Writer Makes Demands</TE>
<TE>   The letter was found behind a Ponderosa steakhouse parking lot
about 50 feet from where the victim fell. The note contained demands
for dialogue with police and several threatening passages, said an
official involved with the task force. Authorities were convinced
soon after studying the letter that it was genuine and decided during
a high-level meeting Sunday to open communications with him.</TE>
<TE>   "They're confident this is the guy," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal agents said the letter was "very lengthy" and poorly
worded, bordering on broken English. Officials would not speculate
whether the wording indicated whether the writer was a native English
speaker or foreign-born.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities close to the task force also said the letter contained
unspecified threatening language about children -- a warning that
appeared to have played a role in prompting school officials in
Richmond and surrounding suburbs to cancel classes Monday.</TE>
<TE>   School superintendents in Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico
counties and the city of Richmond had said earlier in the day that a
surge in calls from anxious parents after the Ashland shooting led to
the move. "People are very concerned about how we can assure safety,"
said Henrico Supt. Mark A. Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said a man presumed to be the killer called the
FBI's sniper tip hotline in Washington soon after the shooting in the
Ponderosa parking lot. The caller said he had left a note.</TE>
<TE>   "The telephone call saying the note is there came after the
shooting," an FBI official said. "Whether the note was there
beforehand is what they're trying to ascertain."</TE>
<TE>   Officials have parceled out little about their dialogue.
Montgomery County police spokeswoman Lucille Baur at one point
canceled an appearance by Moose, saying police were at a "very
sensitive stage of the investigation."</TE>
<TE>   "The real issue is they don't want to put anything out there that
would jeopardize this or tip the sniper to do something more," the
FBI official said. "If you make the wrong move, it could set him off.
They don't know what makes him tick."</TE>
<TE>   Former investigators who have been involved in similar
back-channel communications with criminal suspects said task force
officials can only improve the prospects of capture by drawing out
the killer in talks.</TE>
<TE>   "Any kind of contact we have with him is good," said former FBI
profiler Clint Van Zandt. "So many times we see a one-way taunting,
and today there is some two-way communication going on. That's very
positive."</TE>
<TE>   Police found a tarot card with a skeletal image of death at an
earlier shooting. On the card, dropped near a shell casing outside a
Prince George's County, Md., middle school where a 13-year-old
student was wounded, was a message: "Dear Mr. Policeman, I am God."</TE>
<TE>   Even as police tried to draw the killer into conversation over the
weekend, they also reportedly tried to trace the calls he made. At
least one of those traces, an official said, led to the Richmond pay
phone where police rousted two men at gunpoint Monday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Moving at lightning speed, the stakeout at first seemed to have
finally ended the killer's 20-day rampage. Richmond SWAT officers
armed with assault rifles and bulletproof vests dashed out from a car
dealership parking lot and surrounded a white Plymouth minivan parked
at a pay phone by an Exxon station shortly after 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Don Neilson, 49, a service manager at Royal Oldsmobile, was
stunned to see police bolt from cars parked in the dealership's lot
and run toward the van. Within seconds, several officers pulled at
the car's passenger door while others aimed their rifles at a rear
window. Finally, Neilson and others at the lot watched as one
policeman reached inside the van and yanked the driver outside.</TE>
<TE>   Tall and dark-skinned, the man was later identified as an
undocumented immigrant. But for a moment, car salesman Jackie Liege
thought Richmond police had finally ended the sniper's reign of
terror. "I saw the white van there and I thought, 'Now maybe they've
got the guy,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   But when service station owner Nizan Kahn saw the second man
police had grabbed handcuffed inside a cruiser, he recognized him as
a regular customer who bought cheap phone cards -- not the sniper.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think he was that kind of guy," Kahn said.</TE>
<TE>   Turned Over to INS</TE>
<TE>   After hours of interrogation, Richmond police concluded that
Kahn's instinct was correct.</TE>
<TE>   The two men, undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala,
had made the mistake of driving a white van up to a phone booth being
watched by police.</TE>
<TE>   "It does appear that these individuals were simply in the wrong
place at the wrong time," said a federal law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   The two men are being turned over to the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and will face deportation hearings, said INS
spokesman Russ Bergeron. The men will be charged with INS violations,
including being in the United States illegally, Bergeron said.</TE>

<HD>Burial Box Bears Inscription of 'James ... Brother of
Jesus'</HD>
<DH>The finding could be the earliest archeological evidence of
the biblical figure. However, scholars say they may never know for
sure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A French scholar has discovered what may be the earliest
archeological evidence of Jesus -- a 1,940-year-old limestone burial
box bearing the inscription "James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus."</LD>
<LD>   The 20-inch-long box for holding the bones of the dead, known as
an ossuary, dates from AD 63 and all evidence suggests that it is
genuine and not a forgery, said paleographer Andre Lemaire of the
Sorbonne University in Paris, who discovered it in a private
collection.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery, which so far has survived the scrutiny of a variety
of scholars and scientists, could be one of the most important finds
in New Testament archeology, said Hershel Shanks, publisher of the
Biblical Archeology Review, which is reporting Lemaire's findings in
its November/December issue. Until this find, the oldest existing
text with the name "Jesus" was a papyrus fragment of the New
Testament dated about a century after Jesus' death. One of the major
questions facing historians is whether the James mentioned in the
inscription is actually St. James, who headed the church in Jerusalem
after Jesus' death, or whether the inscription refers to another
family entirely.</LD>
<TE>   Although Lemaire said at a news conference Monday that it is "very
probable" the box held the bones of St. James, P. Kyle McCarter of
Johns Hopkins University told the same gathering that "we may never
be absolutely certain."</TE>
<TE>   "In the work I do, we are rarely absolutely certain about
anything," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is real," said John McCray of Wheaton College in Illinois.
"The big question is, are we 100% sure that the reference is to Jesus
[Christ]? The answer is no, we are not 100% certain, but the
probabilities are very strong that it is."</TE>
<TE>   The reservations stem from the fact that no one knows where the
ossuary has been for 19 centuries. The unidentified Israeli collector
who owns the ossuary purchased it 15 years ago from a Jerusalem
antiquities dealer for "$200 to $700," Lemaire said. The dealer, in
turn, bought it from an Arab who said he found it in Silwan, a
Jerusalem suburb that is the site of thousands of tombs.</TE>
<TE>   McCarter said he was disappointed that there was little
information available about the ossuary's original location and
history. "This leaves us in the awkward position of always having
doubts," he said. "They will always be there."</TE>
<TE>   Ossuaries were used by Jews in the 1st century AD, transferring
bones from burial caves to the boxes after all the flesh had
naturally decayed. The practice was largely abandoned after the
destruction of the Jewish Temple in AD 70. No one is quite sure why
the practice started or stopped, but it provides a rare period of
self-documentation in which commoners as well as leaders left their
names carved in stone.</TE>
<TE>   Lemaire is a well-known epigrapher who specializes in analyzing
texts from the early Christian era. He was shown the ossuary on a
visit to Jerusalem this year. The owner did not recognize the
significance of the inscription.</TE>
<TE>   The box is trapezoidal in shape, slightly wider at the top than
the bottom. The lid is slightly convex. The inscription on the side
is in simple Aramaic, in a cursive form of writing that was used only
from about AD 10 to AD 70, Lemaire said. Aramaic was spoken
throughout the Near East from about 300 BC to AD 650, and was the
language of Jesus and his contemporaries.</TE>
<TE>   Lemaire was suspicious of the text at first because it had an
unusual way of saying "brother of."</TE>
<TE>   But a search of other documents from the period by Lemaire
revealed similar phraseology, thereby lending authenticity to the
ossuary. It's unlikely a forger would have chosen such phraseology,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Laboratory tests performed by researchers at the Geological Survey
of Israel confirm that the box is made from a porous limestone from
the Jerusalem area. Most important, the box is coated by a thin
patina, or sheen, indicating that it was stored in a cave for
centuries. That patina covers the inscription as well as the box, the
researchers found, and it contains no chemicals indicating that it is
of modern origin.</TE>
<TE>   There is "no evidence that might detract from the authenticity" of
the bone box, the Israeli Geological Survey wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The bones were missing from the ossuary because they were probably
taken by Jewish Christians who fled so that James' remains would not
be desecrated by the Romans, speculates Ben Witherington III of
Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Ky. The box itself would have
been too heavy to carry, he said, especially if they were leaving in
haste.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, all three names were very common in the Jerusalem
of that period. Researchers have already discovered at least two
ossuaries that say "James, son of Joseph," McCray said. "But to have
all three names is highly significant and extremely unusual, and
indicates the importance of the name Jesus."</TE>
<TE>   Records from the period allowed Lemaire to estimate how many men
in Jerusalem carried each of the three names. Using simple math, he
was then able to estimate that there were no more than 20 men in the
city of 80,000 who were named James, who had a father named Joseph
and who had a brother named Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that most people did not use ossuaries, and most who did
so did not name their brothers on them, suggests that this ossuary is
"very unusual." There is only one other known example in Aramaic of a
brother being named on an ossuary, he said. Thus, this particular
Jesus must have been very notable.</TE>
<TE>   If the artifact is genuine, it could raise some thorny theological
issues. Protestant doctrine says that James is a brother of Jesus,
while Orthodox churches say that he is the son of Joseph by an
earlier marriage, and thus only a halfbrother to Jesus.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Catholic doctrine, however, says that Mary was a virgin all
her life and that James is only a cousin of Jesus, perhaps the son of
Joseph's brother Clopas. If the ossuary is genuine, it would rule out
that interpretation, Witherington said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Jewish historian Josephus, James was stoned to
death as a Jewish heretic in AD 62.</TE>
<TE>   There are no current plans to display the ossuary publicly, but
the Discovery Channel is producing a documentary about it that is
expected to air for Easter.</TE>

<HD>Lackey's Start Icing on Cake</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--As memorable birthdays go, this one ranks way above
getting your driver's license. On his 24th birthday Wednesday, rookie
John Lackey will start Game 4 of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   "That's pretty cool," Lackey said. "It's a big day regardless of
whether it's my birthday, but that makes it that much more exciting,
and my family will be here to share it with me.</LD>
<LD>   "My birthday always comes during the World Series, but this is
different. I'll be here playing in it instead of watching it at
home."</LD>
<TE>   Although he threw 32 pitches in relief Sunday, Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia said Monday that Lackey would start Game 4. And, although
Kevin Appier lasted only two innings Sunday and has pitched 17 1/3
innings in four postseason starts, Scioscia said Appier would start
in Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel Appier has enough gas in his tank," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Ace Jarrod Washburn is scheduled to start Game 5. If a decisive
seventh game is necessary, the Angels will choose between Lackey on
three days' rest or Ramon Ortiz on regular rest.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If Ortiz struggles tonight, the Angels could use Scot Shields for
the first time in the playoffs. The Angels bypassed Shields for
Lackey in the two previous postseason games in which they needed a
long reliever, but Lackey is unavailable tonight. Shields has not
pitched in 25 days, the longest he has ever gone between appearances.</TE>
<TE>   In his last 12 innings of relief during the regular season, he did
not give up a hit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are expected to start Benji Gil ahead of Adam Kennedy
at second base in Game 4 Wednesday, when the Giants start left-hander
Kirk Rueter.</TE>
<TE>   In the last game of the league championship series, Kennedy hit
three home runs, including one off Minnesota left-hander Johan
Santana. Kennedy said Monday that he did not expect that success to
figure into Scioscia's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Not now," he said. "If it were a day later, it might have. I'm
sure he'll try not to let that influence him."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO--It didn't go over the river and through the woods, but
Barry Bonds' moonshot home run off Angel closer Troy Percival in the
ninth inning of World Series Game 2 Sunday night, a prodigious blast
that traveled an estimated 485 feet, did go through a tunnel halfway
up the right-field bleachers.</LD>
<LD>   David Behrend, 34, a real estate investor from Santa Monica, was
standing with his sister by the tunnel near Section 238 in Edison
Field during the ninth, hoping to make a quick exit after the last
pitch, when Bonds' shot went over his head, bounced twice through the
tunnel and off a concession stand.</LD>
<LD>   "I ran about 10 yards to get it, and five guys piled onto me, like
it was a fumble recovery," said Behrend, a Dodger fan and a native of
South Africa. "The security guards pulled them off of me, and one guy
offered me $500 on the spot. I said, 'It's not for sale.' "</LD>
<TE>   To authenticate the ball, Behrend had a stadium security guard,
Connie Hernandez, write her name, phone number and badge number on
it. Hernandez verified Behrend's story -- "Everything he said is
true," she said -- and Behrend said he would donate the ball to the
Susan G. Komen Foundation for breast-cancer research.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Elliott, owner of Past Times Collectibles in Fullerton,
doesn't believe the value of the ball will be affected by Hernandez's
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "Like anything that is recovered in a crowd, you want some
authentication," Elliott said. "As long as the name is not scribbled
across the entire ball, and it can be hidden while being displayed, I
wouldn't worry. I think the guy did the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Behrend said Hernandez's writing on the ball was "minimal." The
question is, how much is it worth?</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't win a game, but it was hit into the stratosphere by the
greatest hitter of our era," Elliott said. "It definitely has value.
I would say someone would pay between $8,000 and $10,000."</TE>
<TE>   If the ball were signed by Bonds, Elliott said, it's value would
jump to the $15,000 range. If there were verification that Bonds'
shot was the longest home run in World Series history, Elliott
believes, it could fetch something in the $50,000 range.</TE>
<TE>   Records for such feats are sketchy, though. Old Metropolitan
Stadium in Minneapolis was the first to estimate home run distances
in the early 1960s, and Major League Baseball retained IBM in the
late 1980s to develop a program to compute home run distances, based
on seating charts.</TE>
<TE>   Said Rich Levin, spokesman for the commissioner's office, "There's
a chance it could be the longest homer in World Series history. I
don't know if there's any way to prove it."</TE>
<TE>   Rachael Vizcarra, who has been Bonds' publicist for 11 years, said
Bonds would gladly sign the ball as long as it was donated to
charity.</TE>
<TE>   "He wouldn't give it a second thought," she said.</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma, Miami Lead BCS Standings</HD>
<DH>Ratings to determine teams to play in title game seem in
line so far, but Notre Dame could leap to No. 2 next week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The season's first release of the bowl championship series standings,
that roulette-wheel-like ratings system that has bungled college
football's last two national championship games, provided another
shock Monday.</LD>
<LD>   This time, however, the surprise is that the BCS standings are in
almost ironclad agreement with conventional wisdom -- at least for
one week.</LD>
<LD>   You could quibble over the BCS' batting order, but the top two
teams are Oklahoma and Miami, generally conceded as the nation's best
football-playing schools.</LD>
<TE>   Oklahoma, lifted by consecutive victories over Texas and Iowa
State, debuted at No. 1 in the BCS rankings with a point total of
3.92, comfortably ahead of No. 2 Miami at 6.61.</TE>
<TE>   Although Miami is firmly entrenched at No. 1 in both national
polls, with Oklahoma at No. 2, it only matters in the BCS that you
finish first or second.</TE>
<TE>   At season's end, the two schools with the lowest point totals will
play for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the BCS' top 10 are Notre Dame at No. 3, followed by
Virginia Tech, Georgia, Ohio State, Washington State, Michigan,
Louisiana State and Texas.</TE>
<TE>   USC debuts at No. 14, one position ahead of the Trojans' opponent
this week, Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS system was implemented in 1998 as a way to better
determine the national title game participants in a sport that does
not have a playoff system.</TE>
<TE>   There are four components in the formula: average of the two
national polls, strength of schedule, losses and computer-rating
average.</TE>
<TE>   The last two seasons, though, the final BCS standings produced
outrage.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Oklahoma and Miami were the top schools in both national
polls but Florida State, which had lost to Miami, got to play
Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl because it finished second in the BCS
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Miami and Oregon were 1-2 in both polls, yet Nebraska
ended up second in the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   And, if recent history is any indication, this week's moment of
BCS bliss may not last.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, the top six schools in the BCS standings are
undefeated and only two of those, Miami and Virginia Tech, play each
other.</TE>
<TE>   If five of the top six teams win the rest of their games, all
could make a legitimate claim to a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "There's seven weeks to go, there's so many games left to be
played," Big East Commissioner Michael Tranghese, this year's BCS
coordinator, said Monday. "But, right now, I didn't think at this
stage of the season that the top six teams in the BCS poll would be
undefeated, but they are."</TE>
<TE>   That could spell more trouble for a 5-year-old system that has
been picked apart like a Thanksgiving turkey.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's more than two teams undefeated at the end of the year,
there will be much yelling and screaming and controversy," Tranghese
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing is, the system, through its process, will select
the two teams that will get a chance to play for it."</TE>
<TE>   But alas, we might not even have to wait that long for the BCS'
first major dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Should Notre Dame, third in the BCS standings, defeat Florida
State on Saturday in Tallahassee, the Irish could jump Miami for the
coveted No. 2 spot.</TE>
<TE>   Miami leads Notre Dame by only 1.34 points. A win over Florida
State would, at the least, improve Notre Dame's current No. 6 poll
average.</TE>
<TE>   "It would bump them up in the polls, obviously," Tranghese
acknowledged. "It would be close."</TE>
<TE>   You could not imagine the indignation in Coral Gables if the Irish
overtook Miami, which has been No. 1 in the Associated Press poll for
a record 20 consecutive weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Tranghese can only hope these potential thorny scenarios play
themselves out and the season ends peacefully, but the BCS has been
hit and miss on consensus building.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS standings got off to a strong start the first two years by
pairing the right two teams for the national title. There wasn't much
argument over Tennessee-Florida State in 1998 or Virginia
Tech-Florida State in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But major problems in 2000 and 2001 have revived calls in many
quarters for a college playoff system. That can't happen until 2006
at the earliest, when the BCS contract expires, and it may not happen
then.</TE>
<TE>   "Playoff proponents are going to argue playoff whether we have two
undefeated teams or one undefeated team or no undefeated teams, and I
understand that," Tranghese said.</TE>
<TE>   "But, that's an argument for another day. The BCS is here, and
it's going to be here for four more years. I don't hear [university]
presidents yelling and screaming for a playoff."</TE>

<HD>Retired No More, Carter a Dolphin</HD>
<DH>Former Viking receiver, who will soon turn 37, says
ex-Miami great Marino influenced him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pro Bowl receiver Cris Carter came out of retirement Monday and
signed with the Miami Dolphins, partly because he couldn't walk away
from football, partly because fellow HBO analyst Dan Marino wouldn't
stop pestering him.</LD>
<LD>   "Marino is crazy," said Carter, who turns 37 next month and was
working on the cable network's "Inside the NFL." "I had squashed the
whole idea. Danny and I were getting ready to go to the studio, and
he's down in the limo, and I tell him. He just goes ballistic. 'You
have to do it. You can still play. It's a great situation for you.
You want to go there.' I said, 'Dan, you're crazy. Just let it go.' "</LD>
<LD>   Evidently, though, Carter was interested from the moment the
Dolphins approached him to round out their receiving corps, which
recently lost Oronde Gadsden to a season-ending wrist injury.
Quarterback Jay Fiedler also is recovering from a broken thumb on his
throwing hand.</LD>
<TE>   Miami (5-2) has a one-game lead in the AFC East but is coming off
a 23-10 loss to Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins are off this week, giving Carter an extra week to get
familiar with the playbook before a Monday game at Green Bay in two
weeks. The Dolphins were one of the teams he visited as a free agent
last spring after being released by Minnesota, which had cast its lot
with Randy Moss.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins made room for Carter by placing Gadsden on injured
reserve. Gadsden had decided to undergo wrist surgery right away
unless he was offered a contract extension to his liking. That he
opted for the operation means he almost certainly has played his last
game as a Dolphin.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a lot of research on Cris," Miami Coach Dave Wannstedt
said. "Obviously, you know we had a meeting in March. We spent a lot
of time talking with him, so we felt we knew what Cris is all about
and what he could bring to this football team."</TE>
<TE>   Carter reportedly agreed to a one-year contract with $600,000
guaranteed and $700,000 in incentives. But he insists it wasn't the
money that brought him back.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed being around the guys and game day," he said. "This
opportunity just ran me down. There was nothing I could do. My wife
said, 'You are really crazy. You've fallen out of bed and bumped your
head.' As I began to think about it, I just couldn't avoid it."</TE>
<TE>   A Pro Bowl player for eight consecutive seasons, Carter caught
1,093 passes and scored 129 touchdowns in 15 seasons with
Philadelphia and Minnesota. He also brings some baggage. He is
regarded by many in the NFL as one of the league's more self-centered
players, and TV cameras caught some of his emotional explosions on
the Viking sideline last season.</TE>
<TE>   During a loss to Chicago, he couldn't control his anger on the
field when he was open but didn't get the ball. He screamed at
quarterback Daunte Culpepper, a couple of assistant coaches, even
then-coach Dennis Green.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an emotional player," Green said the next day. "And a great
competitor. He knows that's not a good deal. He got a little carried
away."</TE>
<TE>   Moss said he supports Carter's return, but hinted Carter might be
a target after speaking his mind on HBO.</TE>
<TE>   "I love it," Moss said in Minnesota. "And I think a lot of
football teams he's been making comments about will love it too."</TE>

<LD>Much has been made of the Mighty Ducks' kiddie corps this season, and
thus far, the players have been worth talking about.</LD>
<LD>   Forward Stanislav Chistov scored his second goal of the season in
Sunday's 3-2 overtime victory over Colorado. Forward Alexei Smirnov
battled anyone who violated his airspace.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Kurt Sauer spent the day working against Peter Forsberg
and Joe Sakic and even chased down Forsberg on a breakaway, forcing
him into a bad shot.</LD>
<TE>   "Look at Vancouver, their young guys have evolved because they
played them," Coach Mike Babcock said. "That's what we got to do. We
have to play our young people here because that's the only chance we
have to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Babcock has been able to separate his rookie forwards, which has
increased their effectiveness. Smirnov skates with center Adam Oates
and right wing Petr Sykora. Chistov has worked with center Matt
Cullen and Andy McDonald.</TE>
<TE>   Sauer, with only three years of junior hockey behind him, has been
paired with Keith Carney, the Ducks' top defenseman, every game this
season. That usually has him on the ice against the opposing team's
top line.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Sauer has been anything but starry-eyed. "The kid has been
outstanding," Babcock said. "Even to the point that we never talk
about him as a coaching staff. We think about him as part of the
team's framework."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Mike Brown, whom the Ducks claimed on waivers from
Vancouver on Oct. 11, still is working on visa requirements to enter
the United States. Duck officials expect Brown to join the team in
Vancouver on Wednesday, the beginning of a five-game trip.</TE>

<KH>ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS THE WORLD SERIES</KH>
<HD>Insult and Batteries</HD>
<DH>Giant fans are rowdier than their Southland counterparts,
as Angels are about to find out</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Francisco baseball fans do not need a state rivalry, north
against south, to get their blood roiling.</LD>
<LD>   They don't need ideological differences or arguments over water
rights. They don't even need a visit from the dreaded Dodgers.</LD>
<LD>   Given a history of clashes with various opponents, it seems almost
any team can start the otherwise sophisticated citizenry hurling
insults -- along with occasional coins, batteries and produce -- onto
the field.</LD>
<TE>   So, while tough crowds are more often associated with cities such
as New York and Philadelphia, the Angels might face a rude
introduction when they arrive at Pacific Bell Park to play the San
Francisco Giants in Game 3 of the World Series tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Ask players from around the major leagues or, for that matter, a
San Francisco team executive.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are Giant fans tend to be more outwardly passionate,"
said Jorge Costa, senior vice president of ballpark operations. "They
are much more vocal, volatile. They tend to wear their emotions on
their sleeves."</TE>
<TE>   With the Series tied at one game each, making tonight's game
pivotal, a local restaurateur plans to toss a rally monkey in the
deep fryer. A season-ticket holder warns that the regulars who sit
beside the visitors' bullpen will have beers in hand and tongues
sharpened. Another fan explains: "The Angels aren't the Dodgers, but
they are the last team between the Giants and the World Series"
championship.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels know what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure [the fans] will be into it," said hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher, a former Dodger. "We know some players will get abused."</TE>
<TE>   The great majority of Giant faithful are well-mannered. After all,
this is a city where the football team, the 49ers, draws a so-called
"wine-and-cheese" crowd. But a rowdy element at baseball games has a
way of making its presence felt.</TE>
<TE>   During the recent National League championship series, the St.
Louis Cardinals complained about "real brutal cases" of fans taunting
not only players but also their relatives in the stands. "We've had a
couple of our wives actually leave the ballpark and go back to the
hotel because of the insults and profanity," Cardinal Manager Tony La
Russa said.</TE>
<TE>   After one game, fans leaving the stadium banged on the side of a
St. Louis team bus. According to a police report, Cardinal pitcher
Garrett Stephenson emerged and slapped a 35-year-old man.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a guy who had really, really gone over the edge," La
Russa said. "So I'm very pleased that Garrett told him to give it a
rest [for the sake] of the ladies on the bus, told him he should shut
his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals are not the only team to face such treatment. San
Diego Padre players have dodged flying batteries. Last season, a
small group of fans heckled Cincinnati Red first baseman Dmitri Young
to the point where he challenged them to fight. The next day, they
allegedly tossed an egg into the Chicago Cub bullpen and, the
following day, jeered Cub pitcher Julian Tavarez, a former Giant,
until he too lashed out.</TE>
<TE>   Like other professional sports, baseball has experienced an
increasing number of ugly incidents between team members and fans. A
Kansas City Royal coach was attacked on the field at Comiskey Park in
Chicago last month and, two years ago in the same city, many Dodgers
charged into the stands at Wrigley Field, resulting in 20
suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   But Costa suspects Southern Californians might be specifically
troubled by reports of unruliness by their neighbors to the north.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the classic L.A.-San Francisco deal," he said. "The
perception of people in L.A. is laid-back, passive, easy come, easy
go. The perception of people in San Francisco is either a)
over-educated and snobbish or b) downright volatile and hard to deal
with."</TE>
<TE>   At San Francisco State University, administrator Matt Itelson says
the difference might be a combination of underdog mentality -- the
Giants have not won a World Series since arriving from New York in
1958 -- and civic pride.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe there's more to be proud about," Itelson said. "It's such a
wonderful, cosmopolitan city. Maybe that makes fans more passionate."</TE>
<TE>   By now, the Angels might have heard horror stories from their
manager, Mike Scioscia, and three of their coaches -- Hatcher,
Alfredo Griffin and Ron Roenicke -- who played for a team that always
felt San Francisco's wrath.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw it from the perspective of being a Dodger, which was an
incredible experience," Scioscia said. "We'd get pummeled with
oranges, everything you could imagine, on our way to the dugout and
back to the clubhouse after the game."</TE>
<TE>   Hatcher also recalled debris sailing onto the field. He played
alongside Reggie Smith who, in 1981, charged into the stands after a
fan threw a plastic batting helmet at him.</TE>
<TE>   No one agitated the San Francisco crowd more than Tom Lasorda, an
executive and former manager for the Dodgers, with his showmanship
and talk of bleeding blue. "None of my players would walk with me for
fear that someone was going to shoot at me and miss and get them," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Lasorda calls Giant rowdies "the worst fans I've seen," he
always kept a sense of humor about them. When he walked to the mound
for a pitching change, he sometimes doffed his cap and bowed, even
blew a kiss. Oddly enough, the Giants asked him to make a speech at
the last game in their former stadium, Candlestick Park, on Sept. 30,
1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I finally realized something about you people," Lasorda told
those in attendance. "I realize you don't really hate me. You hate
yourselves because you really love me."</TE>
<TE>   He chuckled at the memory: "They went crazy."</TE>
<TE>   With the Angels in San Francisco for a three-game stretch -- they
have visited only a few times since interleague play began in 1997 --
Hatcher agrees with the jocular approach. Some of his players, he
said, "get a kick out of the brutal things that are said to them....
[They] might even laugh and egg them on a bit."</TE>
<TE>   He also thinks San Franciscans have mellowed in the three seasons
since they switched stadiums.</TE>
<TE>   Candlestick was big and gray and infamous for its bitter winds,
even in summer, an environment Dodger announcer Vin Scully once
described as "having all the warmth of a graveyard." He said: "I
don't know if it was the cold, damp weather, but the fans there had a
meanness about them."</TE>
<TE>   The new ballpark is cozier, warmer, nestled by the bay. Angel
first baseman Scott Spiezio, who played at both venues, said the
crowds are "enthusiastic, but there aren't as many fanatics" at Pac
Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   So there is reason to expect tonight's game will go smoothly.</TE>
<TE>   The team has communicated with fans about unacceptable behavior.
Because this is the World Series, security will be tight and there
will be a high percentage of corporate types in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   Even the discord between Northern and Southern Californians --
Costa calls it "a lot of baggage" -- might be muted. The Angels are
not likely to trigger a Dodger-like response.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a different deal," said Paul Bliss, a 42-year-old
season-ticket holder from Sausalito. "With the Dodgers, that's such
an old rivalry and the Angels are so new."</TE>
<TE>   But, as recent history suggests, some Giant fans are always on the
verge of what season-ticket holder Keith Perry called "getting out of
hand."</TE>
<TE>   Though Perry agrees the new park and its higher ticket prices draw
a different demographic -- more wine than beer, more talking on cell
phones than screaming at opposing third basemen -- he says some of
the old guard remains. And Pac Bell Park's retro architecture, which
places seats nearer to the foul lines, offers new opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "The new ballpark puts fans so close to the field that when they
get on the players, it's so much more obvious," he said. "I have a
friend who sits near the visiting bullpen and I would say he's in the
verbal abusive category, especially when he has been imbibing."</TE>
<TE>   The outfield bleachers also remain a place where fans go, as
Itelson said, "to be around a bunch of people who are loud, who do a
little more taunting and talking smack."</TE>
<TE>   It seems Giant fans don't need much excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't get a sense of a rivalry, but who knows?" Dan Dawson of
Napa said of the series against the Angels. "Get into a couple of
fights, clear the benches ... then maybe we can work up a good
hatred."</TE>

<KH>GIANT NOTES</KH>
<HD>Aurilia Got Quick Look at Rodriguez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>When shortstop Rich Aurilia stepped to the plate against Angel
reliever Francisco Rodriguez to start the sixth inning Sunday night,
his thoughts were on a scouting report provided by teammate Jeff
Kent, who said Rodriguez sometimes has trouble with his control.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, I was the first guy to face him, so I thought I'd take the
first pitch to see what was going on," Aurilia said. "The next thing
I know, 21 seconds passed, and I'm walking back the dugout after
looking at three pitches. If that was the book on him, he had an off
night."</LD>
<LD>   Rodriguez, the 20-year-old phenom with the 95-mph fastball and
nasty slider, was dominant in Game 2, retiring nine straight batters,
four on strikeouts, to gain the win. Of his 26 pitches, 22 were
strikes.</LD>
<TE>   The Giants may have derived one benefit from their futile effort
against Rodriguez, though -- at least now they'll know what to expect
when they face him again.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is seeing a guy's release point, knowing what they
throw," first baseman J.T. Snow said. "When you haven't faced a guy
all year, the advantage goes to the pitcher. Now that we've seen his
fastball and slider, it won't make it any easier next time, but the
only way you get better at things is seeing them more and more.
Hopefully, we'll get the lead so we don't have to face him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Livan Hernandez, the Giants' right-hander who will start Game 3
tonight, is 69-69 with a 4.42 earned-run average in 180 regular
season starts, but he is 6-0 with a 2.84 ERA in eight playoff
appearances, winning most valuable player honors with the Florida
Marlins in the 1997 World Series and National League championship
series.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're from Cuba and you have to pitch to survive and feed
your family, then you're going to have a tendency to be good in big
games," Manager Dusty Baker said. "In Cuba, where he came from,
during the Pan Am Games and international competitions, it's about
survival, basically.</TE>
<TE>   "I think part of it is because he knows how to relax. The guys
that know how to relax the best but still concentrate with that fire
inside of them are usually the guys that do the best."</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia feels the shifting of the World Series to Pacific Bell
Park favors his team.</TE>
<TE>   "We gain the use of our pitchers in the lineup," he said, "and our
pitchers are used to hitting.</TE>
<TE>   "And they lose the DH and they have a pretty good one in Brad
Fullmer."</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, Giant pitchers hit .181 with two home
runs and 23 RBIs, hardly numbers that cause opposing pitchers to
shudder.</TE>
<TE>   But Giant pitchers were successful moving a runner over on a
sacrifice bunt 45 times, a skill Angel pitchers don't get a chance to
perfect in game conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia also figures the scoring has to come down in Pac Bell
Park.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't have a night like you had [in Game 2, won by the Angels
11-10] in this park," he said. "The ball doesn't carry that well here
in cold weather. You won't see 21 runs scored unless there are 50 to
60 singles."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A day after saying he was through talking to the media about the
future of his manager, guess what Giant managing general partner
Peter Magowan was talking about?</TE>
<TE>   That's right, the future of his manager.</TE>
<TE>   "When we went to spring training, there were certain things we
wanted to see out of Dusty and we've seen them," said Magowan, "It
should only take a few days to figure it out when this is over."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the last time Magowan is discussing the subject. At
least until the next person asks.</TE>

<HD>Helmets Are a Safety Issue</HD>
<DH>High school football players are adjusting air pressure of
their head gear, which has experts worried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With alarming regularity, and often with next to no supervision, high
school football players are changing the air pressure of their
football helmets -- a potentially dangerous practice, experts say.</LD>
<LD>   At football games across Southern California last weekend, Times
reporters witnessed players hurriedly asking trainers, coaches,
teammates, even student team managers, to either inflate or deflate
the air bladders that line the inside of their helmets and cushion
the impact of a hit to their head.</LD>
<LD>   Small hand pumps were used to add air and ball needles were used
to remove it, adjustments made quickly between plays on routinely
chaotic sidelines.</LD>
<TE>   "The trainers are busy, so I don't want to bother them," said
Alvaro Calderon, a lineman from Woodland Hills Taft High. "I ask the
water boy to pump it up."</TE>
<TE>   Nationally last year, five of the seven fatalities directly
related to high school football were from brain injuries, according
to information from the National Center for Catastrophic Sports
Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. Among them was
Matt Colby, a 17-year-old senior from Costa Mesa High who collapsed
after trudging to the sideline between plays of a game against
Huntington Beach Ocean View in September of last year. He never
regained consciousness and died the next day after being taken off
life support.</TE>
<TE>   A Gabrielino High lineman has been in a coma since Oct. 4, the
result of a head injury. Andrew Castillo collapsed on the sideline
during the fourth quarter of a game against Burbank, shortly after
complaining of blurry vision, dizziness and a headache.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of his injury has not been determined but earlier
Castillo had told teammates he "didn't have enough air in his helmet
during the game," fellow lineman Sam Dominguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Gabrielino Coach Vince Lopez said the team usually has an air pump
but could not locate it on the sideline that night.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say not enough research has been performed linking brain
trauma to under-inflated helmets, but they say improper inflation is
risky.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have no air, then if you get hit on the helmet, the helmet
transmits the full force to the head, and the head absorbs whatever
the impact might be," said Martin Holland, an assistant professor of
neurology at the University of California, San Francisco. "The role
of the bladders are to absorb the impact in the same way that air
bags do in cars."</TE>
<TE>   Holland said he attended a high school game in the Bay Area last
week and was distressed by the discrepancy in the quality of helmets
the players were wearing. "I don't know how much a school's budget
plays a part in it, but not everybody has a top-of-the-line helmet,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Air-fit helmet systems were introduced in the 1970s, replacing
models with padded cells and suspension straps. The next step could
be the Revolution -- a new, lighter model released this year by
helmet manufacturer Riddell to decrease the risk of concussions by
increasing protection to the jaw and side of the head.</TE>
<TE>   However, most high schools are unable to replace their helmet
stock at one time. A Revolution costs $160, about $60 more than a
standard model. High schools typically replace 20% to 25% of their
helmets each year.</TE>
<TE>   Riddell declined to comment for this story after conferring with
attorneys, a company spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   A properly fitted helmet is "of utmost importance" to a football
player, said Dr. Robert Huizenga, an internist and former L.A.
Raiders team doctor.</TE>
<TE>   With jarring contact, Huizenga said, "Your head gets jostled
around, and what happens is the brain, when it's suddenly stopped,
decelerated suddenly, it hits against sharp projections on the inside
of the skull. It bruises the brain. Even minor trauma can cause
smaller blood vessels to bleed.</TE>
<TE>   "A helmet can't protect you if it doesn't have the proper
dissipation-of-force properties ... The importance of air has been
factored in after years of research."</TE>
<TE>   Don Morrow, football coach at Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, said
players tinker with their helmets' air pressure for comfort. "There
is a proper inflation level, but at most schools kids are tweaking
that, putting more in or taking more out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A helmet that correctly fits a player at the start of a game or
practice might feel too tight as his head swells after exertion. "The
problem is when kids' heads will become so hot and they think they
have to take air out of the helmet," Los Altos Coach Greg Gano said.</TE>
<TE>   Players who purposely release air from their helmets to ease that
sensation could be endangering themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Football is not a game of comfort," said John Castillo, who
operates a helmet reconditioning business in San Antonio. "Some kids
don't like helmets because they're too tight. They don't need to be
comfortable -- they need to be safe. They need to have the helmet
tight on their head. If it's loose, a player's head is going to float
around that helmet when it shouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   Frederick O. Mueller, a University of North Carolina sports injury
researcher, said his studies indicate that it is common practice
among high school football players to adjust their own air pressure.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not a good idea," he said. "They're not getting that
protection."</TE>
<TE>   Helmets come in different sizes, but do not carry a numerical
reference for inflation -- such as is listed on the sidewall of a
tire, for example -- that offers premium protection.</TE>
<TE>   The fitting guidelines are basic: Eyebrows should be about one
inch below the front edge of the helmet; jaw pads should be flush on
the jaw; the chin strap should be snug and centered on the chin; you
should be able to put a finger through the ear hole directly into the
ear.</TE>
<TE>   Many high school coaches conduct a quick helmet test before the
season, when a player is issued equipment. The player puts on the
helmet and buckles the chin strap.</TE>
<TE>   A coach or trainer then checks around the helmet, grabbing the
facemask and checking to see if the helmet moves independently from
the head as the player cranes his head up and down and side to side.
If it does, air is added until a snug fit is achieved.</TE>
<TE>   One to three pumps of air is suggested. Beyond that, it goes by
feel.</TE>
<TE>   Several high school coaches admit they are unsure how much air is
supposed to go into a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Lutheran Coach Jim Kunau said it is "very difficult, if not
impossible" to gauge the actual amount of air in a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Said another coach: "Our guys are always pumping up and pumping
down. How do you know the proper amount [even] if you're a trainer?
This isn't like pumping up tires."</TE>

<LD>It was as intense as a regular-season practice can get for the Kings
Monday at their HealthSouth training facility in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Amid a two-game winless streak, they completed every drill with a
sense of urgency. There were no brawls but the players competed
against each other as if they were fighting for their jobs.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had two outstanding practices the last two days," Coach
Andy Murray said about the Kings, who leave today to start a
five-game trip at Detroit on Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "As a coach, you're always stepping on the ice every day looking
for your best-ever practice.... I don't know if this was the best
ever, but it was close to it."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kings are in second place in the Pacific Division
with seven points, they understand that they need to play better,
what with 13 of their next 15 games away from Staples Center. All the
Kings have to do is look back to last season, when one bad trip in
October adversely affected their playoff position in April.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kings will not practice today, and a decision on injured
winger Ziggy Palffy will not be made until after the team's morning
skate Wednesday. Palffy, on the injured-reserve list because of a
left groin strain, did not skate Monday and has sat out the last
three games.</TE>
<TE>   If Palffy is unable to play against the Red Wings, rookie
Alexander Frolov, who had his first NHL assist in the Kings' 2-2 tie
against Vancouver on Saturday, probably will continue on skate on the
No. 1 line with Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Aaron Miller, sidelined since the start of training
camp after undergoing abdominal surgery, has begun some light
skating. He is scheduled to return Nov. 13.</TE>

<HD>Elements at Pac Bell Present a New Challenge</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The World Series resumes tonight at chillier and quirkier Pacific
Bell Park, where the Giants are not as offensive as they are on the
road, where the game they play is more of the low-scoring type
associated with the National League and where Barry Bonds is just as
menacing but not as statistically prolific.</LD>
<LD>   "How should I say this diplomatically?" San Francisco second
baseman Jeff Kent said, maybe pondering his pending free agency and
the opportunity to play in a more advantageous hitter's environment,
"but this is a very pitcher-friendly park that can frustrate [a
hitter] at times if he's not patient."</LD>
<LD>   Said J.T. Snow, the Giant first baseman: "A lot of the league's
best hitters, especially the left-handers, come down to first base
shaking their heads at what they have to do to hit the ball out of
this park. I'm sure a lot of them would never consider playing here.
The atmosphere is great and the fans are terrific, but we're
definitely a better team on the road offensively."</LD>
<TE>   The series is tied in games, 1-1, and runs, 14-14, and it remains
to be seen what impact Pac Bell has on two torrid offenses -- the
Angels have set a postseason record with 21 home runs in 11 games
while the Giants slugged seven in two games at Edison Field -- but
they had one thing in common while working out Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams were still talking about that home run Bonds hit in the
ninth inning of Game 2, certain that the 485-foot estimate didn't do
it justice, certain that NASA could have provided a more accurate
orbital yardstick than any computerized tape measure, or as Snow
said: "I still haven't seen it come down."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia did and said: "I don't know where they
stopped measuring it, but that was 550 feet if it was an inch. A
little wind and it might have been clear out of the stadium. I'd like
to have seen him hit it in Yankee Stadium so it could have been
measured against some of the most historic home runs."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia could smile and reflect in awe Monday because Troy
Percival didn't injure his neck twisting suddenly to view the Bonds'
rocket and because his closer got a popup from the next batter,
Benito Santiago, to preserve an 11-10 victory.</TE>
<TE>   It was generally agreed, however, that Bonds' sixth homer of the
postseason was the longest in Anaheim history, one of the longest in
World Series history and rivaled a drive, ridiculously estimated at
482 feet, that hit the right-center-field scoreboard at Qualcomm
Stadium in San Diego on June 5.</TE>
<TE>   This one sailed through an entryway halfway up the
right-center-field bleachers, bounced off a concession stand and was
retrieved by a fan who may reap a financial reward if he doesn't
decide to sign a bonus deal with World Wrestling Entertainment for
having out-body slammed others for the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The Bonds blast may have come too late for viewers in the Eastern
and Central time zones, who are advised to wire Bud Selig in
Milwaukee with their complaints, but irrepressible Angel batting
coach Mickey Hatcher saw it clearly and just had to needle Percival.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Troy that Bonds hit it so far that the fans needed a relay
to throw it back on the field," Hatcher said.</TE>
<TE>   Percival could laugh as well and remained convinced he had
supplied at least some of the octane with his 97-mph fastball.</TE>
<TE>   "All of the years I've been doing this," he said, "not many have
turned around one of my fastballs like that. It was awesome."</TE>
<TE>   It was also not entirely unexpected in Percival's view. With two
out and a two-run lead, he was determined not to walk Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had a one-run lead, he wouldn't have got that pitch,"
Percival said. "He still would have got a fastball, but not belt
high, middle of the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I wanted to do was walk him and set a tone that
I'm scared of him. I don't care if he hits four more off me, I'm not
scared of him. I still pitch to [Cleveland nemesis] Jim Thome."</TE>
<TE>   Percival and Bonds are likely to meet again before the series
ends. Maybe tonight, when the Angels play at Pac Bell for the first
time since an interleague series in June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   They are ready for October by the bay, having been outfitted
Monday in red ski caps among other winter wear.</TE>
<TE>   China Basin may not compare to the numbing elements of Candlestick
Point, but it's still not Anaheim, nor are the Angels conditioned to
how balls carom off the 24-foot-high fence that protects McCovey Cove
or the sharp angle at the 404-foot mark in left-center or what Kent
calls the 421-foot "dead man's area" in right-center.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen a lot of guys start high stepping around the bases
thinking they've hit a home run in that area only to have it caught,"
Kent said.</TE>
<TE>   Teams playing at home have only a 15-13 advantage in this
postseason, but the difference in the Giants at home (50-31) compared
to the road (45-35) isn't reflected so much in their win/loss record
but by this:</TE>
<TE>   While their hitters feasted on the road (scoring 69 more runs and
hitting 54 more home runs), their pitchers were clearly more
comfortable at Pac Bell, compiling a 3.03 earned-run average that was
more than a run less than on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember when the Dodger shortstop [Kevin Elster] hit three
home runs in the first game here and everyone said that there were
going to be a lot of cheap homers hit here," said Peter Magowan, the
Giants' managing general partner. "This year, Pac Bell was the second
hardest park in the majors in which to hit homers, and that's the way
I like it. I don't want cheap."</TE>
<TE>   Said Snow: "It's a doubles park. It's a good-pitching,
good-defense, timely-hitting park. We go into a good hitter's park
like Anaheim and tend to relax, knowing we don't have to muscle up at
the plate. Here, unless you're Barry, you've got to hit it on the
nose to get it out. The flip side is that our pitchers have more
confidence here. They know they can make a mistake and not have it
leave the park all the time."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were 45-36 on the road this year and could find the
wide gaps of Pac Bell to their aggressive liking, considering they
are primarily a doubles team despite their postseason home run
record.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bonds hit eight fewer homers in Pac Bell than he did on the
road this year, and the one he hit in Anaheim on Sunday night was
still rattling around everyone's mind here Monday.</TE>

<HD>Favre Won't Miss Time Because of Injured Knee</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brett Favre won't need an operation on his sprained left knee, and
since Green Bay has a bye this week, the Packers' quarterback
shouldn't have to sit out any games.</LD>
<LD>   Favre has a string of 164 consecutive starts, an NFL record for a
quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he probably would have been able to play the game, but I
probably would have held him out," Coach Mike Sherman said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Sherman said he expects Favre to start against Miami on Nov. 4.</TE>
<TE>   An MRI exam confirmed the team's original diagnosis of a sprained
lateral collateral ligament, but the exam showed no structural
damage.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers ordered a knee brace for the three-time league most
valuable player, who was injured Sunday during the third quarter of
Green Bay's 30-9 victory over Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Favre, who owns the longest current starting streak in the league,
regardless of position, won't practice until the team returns from a
long weekend that starts Friday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quincy Carter is out and Chad Hutchinson is in as Dallas' starting
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys made the switch one day after Carter had four passes
intercepted in the Cowboys' 9-6 overtime loss at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson has not played a down in the NFL and last played as a
sophomore at Stanford. He returned to football last summer after
playing professional baseball for four years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson has a fractured left rib and is
doubtful for Sunday's game against Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was hurt during the first quarter of the Buccaneers' 20-10
loss to Philadelphia on Sunday, but he didn't come out until midway
through the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   If he is not ready to play Sunday, he will be replaced by backup
Rob Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say he's out, but it does look like he's doubtful
for this game," Coach Jon Gruden said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carolina quarterback Chris Weinke spent Sunday night in a hospital
in Charlotte, N.C., because of a concussion, leaving the Panthers
with rookie Randy Fasani as their only healthy option for their game
against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Weinke was knocked out of Carolina's loss to Atlanta. Coach John
Fox said he didn't know if Weinke would be able to face the
Buccaneers.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speak hypothetically, but right now he's not healthy,"
Fox said. "So Randy right now would be our starter going into the
week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington Coach Steve Spurrier switched starting quarterbacks for
the third time this season, promoting Shane Matthews and benching
rookie Patrick Ramsey for the Redskins' game against Indianapolis on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier said he expects Matthews to finish the season, although
he had said the same thing about Ramsey.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, we believe Shane Matthews gives our team the best chance
to win games," Spurrier said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee cornerback Samari Rolle was fined $7,500 by the NFL for
a helmet-to-helmet hit that left Jacksonville quarterback Mark
Brunell with a concussion Oct. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Brunell played one more series, then left with a headache.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland rookie cornerback and punt returner Phillip Buchanon, who
broke his left wrist against San Diego, had surgery and will be
sidelined eight weeks....Denver center Tom Nalen is out for the
season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee
against Kansas City....St. Louis cornerback Aeneas Williams had
surgery for torn ligaments in his left ankle and is out for the
season. He was injured against Seattle....Minnesota running back Doug
Chapman was hospitalized because of abdominal pain and internal
bleeding, and was to be kept overnight for observation.</TE>

<LD>The Tampa Bay Lightning is off to an outstanding start thanks to a
dangerous power play.</LD>
<LD>   Martin St. Louis scored twice and Tampa Bay got three power-play
goals Monday night in a 4-2 victory over the New York Rangers at
Madison Square Garden.</LD>
<LD>   Vaclav Prospal and Ben Clymer also scored for the surprising
Lightning, off to the best start in franchise history at 4-0-1.
Nikolai Khabibulin made 18 saves.</LD>
<TE>   The Lightning has scored on the power play in every game this

<TE>   "We just brought the puck to the net," St. Louis said. "You score
one and it gives you confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Mark Messier and Rem Murray scored for the Rangers, who had their
three-game unbeaten streak ended. They had only three power plays to
Tampa Bay's eight.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay's Vincent Lecavalier was scratched because of a knee
sprain and is expected to be sidelined 10 to 14 days. Lecavalier was
injured in Saturday night's tie at Pittsburgh. He has three goals and
four assists in four games.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Calgary 0 -- Curtis Joseph made 24 saves for his first
shutout with Detroit and the 37th of his career, and the host Red
Wings scored two short-handed goals in the second period.</TE>

<KH>Helene Elliott ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Sharks Don't Have Same Bite</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A not-so-funny thing has happened to the San Jose Sharks on their way
to the success widely predicted for them this season.</LD>
<LD>   Goaltender Evgeni Nabokov and defenseman Brad Stuart, cornerstones
of a team that has increased its point total each of the last six
seasons, haven't signed new contracts. Nor has Alexander Korolyuk, a
lesser but still useful forward.</LD>
<LD>   All three are restricted free agents, giving the Sharks the right
to match offers they receive. And there being few things more
restrictive than NHL restricted free agency, they received no offer
sheets.</LD>
<TE>   General Manager Dean Lombardi made new offers to Nabokov and
Stuart last week but there's no imminent end to this stalemate,
leaving the Sharks to scramble for reliable goaltending and to avoid
overburdening defensemen Mike Rathje, Marcus Ragnarsson, Bryan
Marchment and Scott Hannan.</TE>
<TE>   They resorted last week to starting rookie goalie Vesa Toskala,
who won his first start but soon came back down to earth. Miikka
Kiprusoff is their other option, but he gave up 11 goals in his first
two games and he's not the caliber of Nabokov, a Kazakhstan native
who was the NHL's rookie of the year in 2000-01 and won a team-record
37 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   Nabokov, 27, threatened last week to play in Russia, which would
complicate matters. If he did so and later wanted to return to San
Jose, he would have to clear waivers, and he would be grabbed off
long before the Sharks could claim him. However, he hadn't left the
San Jose area as of last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Others have done that before," Lombardi said on the team's Web
site about Nabokov's threat, "but is that the basis to start
allocating more dollars?"</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks had wanted to sign him beyond the next two seasons and
the end of the NHL's collective bargaining agreement with the
players' union. They're apparently anticipating that the age for
unrestricted free agency will be reduced from 31 during the next
labor talks. Lombardi said on the Web site he later had offered a
two-year deal but Nabokov rejected it.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart wants more than the minimum 10% raise the Sharks were
obligated to give him in a qualifying offer, which would have put his
salary at about $1.1 million. Lombardi said that would throw off the
team's economic structure.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, he is a solid contributor to our team but the qualifying
offer was the highest we've ever had," Lombardi said. "The way we go
about allocating our dollars has worked well and has been fair."</TE>
<TE>   Lombardi is in an unenviable position. Teemu Selanne, believing
the Sharks were on the brink of Stanley Cup contention, took less
money to stay in San Jose than he might have gotten on the open
market last summer. But the Sharks won't get far without Nabokov and
Stuart, and if the disputes linger, locker room morale could
deteriorate. It's easy to spend someone else's money, but Lombardi
will probably have to give in, and fairly soon.</TE>
<TE>   Guerin a Guaranteed Help</TE>
<TE>   Memo to King President Tim Leiweke: Being fiscally responsible is
fine, but responsibility to your fans is vital. The Dallas Stars get
it. They missed the playoffs last season and promptly began
rebuilding by signing free-agent winger Bill Guerin to a five-year
deal worth a reported $45 million.</TE>
<TE>   "My expectations are to win the Stanley Cup," said Guerin, who has
made an immediate impact with four goals and seven points in seven
games. "I think they should be everybody's expectations. I think
everybody on our team is thinking that way."</TE>
<TE>   Guerin said the Stars, who had previously emphasized defense,
haven't asked him to change his style. That's smart: it makes no
sense to ask him to change one of the NHL's most aggressive and
prolific games.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to do the things you've been doing for the last number
of years that made you successful, and I'm going to do those things,"
said Guerin, who has been playing on a line with Mike Modano and Ulf
Dahlen.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the Stars aren't concerned that owner Tom Hicks
recently hired an investment bank to look into selling the franchise.</TE>
<TE>   "I was a little surprised when I found out," Guerin said. "I'm
confident that he's going to find an owner that's going to uphold the
same high standards he has."</TE>
<TE>   What's in a name?</TE>
<TE>   When the Red Wings raised their Stanley Cup banner last week, they
also got to see their names on the Stanley Cup -- and goaltender
Manny Legace was dismayed to see that his name had been misspelled on
the plate affixed to the trophy.</TE>
<TE>   It was engraved as "Lagace," which will be corrected. He needn't
feel bad, though. Adam Deadmarsh, when he was with the 1995-96
Colorado Avalanche, became "Deadmarch," on the trophy. That too was
later fixed.</TE>
<TE>   Naked Truth</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to joke about the intrusion onto the ice of a streaker,
who was wearing nothing but red socks, last Thursday at Calgary's
Saddledome. And Eric Francis of the Calgary Sun took humorous note.</TE>
<TE>   "A drunk, naked, sweaty buffoon with red socks," Francis wrote. "I
mean, who wears red socks? Besides, any red-blooded Canadian knows
socks are a no-no if you're going streaking. It clashes with the
watch."</TE>
<TE>   But game security is a serious issue, especially after a father
and son at Chicago's Comiskey Park attacked Kansas City Royals' first
base coach Tom Gamboa last month. The NHL was lucky this time: This
jerk hurt only himself when he slipped and hit his head on the ice.
Next time, it could be a player or coach who is attacked and injured.</TE>
<TE>   Slap Shots</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's Patrick Roy tonight can tie Terry Sawchuk's record of
971 games played by a goaltender. The Avalanche will face the
Edmonton Oilers at Denver. Roy is 518-301-119 in a career that began
in the 1984-85 season. Sawchuk was 447-330-172 from 1949-50 through
1969-70. Roy is about eight games from tying Sawchuk's record for
regular-season minutes, 57,194.... Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux,
benefiting from the crackdown on obstruction, was chosen the NHL's
player of the week for collecting two goals and six assists in three
games last week. Overall, he leads the NHL with four goals and 11
points in five games, mostly skating with Aleksey Morozov and
Vladimir Kovalev. Lemieux, who turned 37 Oct. 5, returns to his
hometown of Montreal today to face the Canadiens.... Florida winger
Valeri Bure is the newest resident of Coach Mike Keenan's doghouse.
He was benched last week and singled out for criticism, a classic
Keenan pattern that inevitably leads to the culprit's being
traded.... Also feeling splinters is Calgary center Rob Niedermayer,
whose stock has plummeted. Flame Coach Greg Gilbert kept Niedermayer
out of the lineup twice last week, saying he needed to show more
consistency and production. It was the first time Niedermayer was a
healthy scratch since his rookie season, 1993-94.... The Boston
Bruins have been hit hard by injuries, and they don't have the depth
to compensate. Winger Martin Lapointe (broken foot), goalie John
Grahame (separated shoulder) and winger Sergei Samsonov (injured
wrist) were victims last week, just as Grahame appeared to be hitting
stride after a suspect start. Samsonov had been playing well with Joe
Thornton and Glen Murray.... Rumors out of Montreal say the Canadiens
are showcasing goalie Jeff Hackett because they don't want to pay him
$3.5 million a year to back up Jose Theodore. Hackett has played well
while Theodore has struggled to regain his MVP form.... Defenseman
Jordan Leopold, winner of the Hobey Baker Award last year as the top
player in college hockey, made his season debut with Calgary on
Saturday after recovering from a concussion. He was drafted by the
Mighty Ducks in 1999 but was dealt to the Flames for the
long-departed Andrei Nazarov. The Flames liked Leopold so much they
sent Derek Morris, considered one of the NHL's top young defensemen,
to Colorado in the Chris Drury trade. Leopold's debut was uneventful,
but he has immense promise.</TE>

<LD>   The Penguins' Mario Lemieux, who leads the league in scoring with
11 points, has had plenty of jump in his legs in leading the Penguins
to a 3-1-1 start. The defending Stanley Cup champion Red Wings will
rely on goaltender Curtis Joseph to slow down Lemieux.</LD>

<HD>Scioscia Is the Angels' Designated Driver</HD>
<DH>With him at the helm, players say being without a
designated hitter the next three games is not a handicap for their
team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- Brad Fullmer and Shawn Wooten would rather stay
busy, but the Angels can't change the World Series rules.</LD>
<LD>   The designated hitter has been eliminated at Pacific Bell Park
because pitchers hit at National League sites and Manager Mike
Scioscia plans to keep the defense intact instead of making room for
Fullmer or Wooten.</LD>
<LD>   Matchups will determine the roles of Fullmer and Wooten in the
next three games, though Scioscia believes they might get more
opportunities than some envision. The Angels aren't complaining as
the all-California World Series resumes tonight in Game 3, focusing
on making the best of the situation.</LD>
<TE>   "Of course you want to be out there playing every game but that's
just not the way it works," Fullmer said. "This is the way they do it
and I don't think anything is going to change for us.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew the pitchers were going to hit when we played up here, so
it's not like a surprise. They'll hit, we'll wait for a chance and be
ready if it comes."</TE>
<TE>   In nine games, Fullmer, who plays against right-handers, is
batting .360 with a home run and five runs batted in. Wooten, who
faces left-handers, is hitting .471 in seven games with a homer and
three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing you look at is you'll have a heck of a bench,"
Scioscia said. "Those guys are hopefully going to be a big part of it
because they're two big bats that we're going to count on and get 'em
in there whenever we can. You have to project matchups a little more
than just waiting for them in the American League where it's a little
easier to insert them at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "If you need some extra innings from your pitcher you're going to
consider a double-switch; if not you can pinch-hit. That's how you
have to approach it because the opportunities won't be as frequent
with the pitchers hitting."</TE>
<TE>   The pitchers on the Angels' World Series roster batted .063 in
interleague games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Jarrod Washburn, scheduled to start Game 5 on
Thursday, has a .357 career average in 14 at-bats and is easily the
best of the bunch for the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Ramon Ortiz is at the other end of the list, seeking
his first hit in 14 career at-bats. Kevin Appier tops the staff with
four RBIs. Giant starter Livan Hernandez brings a .242 career batting
average -- with 18 doubles, four homers and 39 RBIs -- into Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "But we'll be all right because I get to hit and I'm always good,"
Washburn said, jokingly. "Any time you take guys like [Fullmer and
Wooten] out of the lineup it hurts your team.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess you could say it's a disadvantage for the American League
team because [the NL] pitchers hit all year, but he [Scioscia] knows
the National League game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like we're not going to be prepared."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia was trained in that style of play, having spent most of
his career in the Dodger organization, and scouts said the Angels are
reflective of his background.</TE>
<TE>   "The reason we're at where we're at is because we have a lot of
National League in us," Wooten said.</TE>
<TE>   "Small ball -- moving the runner over, hit-and-runs, sac bunts --
is going to play to our advantage, or more to our advantage than
another American League team because of our manager.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pretty much spent his entire career in the National League.
He was a catcher, which is one of the toughest positions to play, and
he really knows that side of it.</TE>
<TE>   "The last two years, every time we played interleague series, he
was really on his game with double-switches and everything."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia downplayed his background, saying it doesn't take a
genius to adapt to the differences in the leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "There's different strategy involved, obviously, because there's
no DH, but it doesn't matter what you consider a manager's style, or
my style, it's what the team can do, and our team is very versatile,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have guys that can play some of the type of ball that might be
more prevalent in the National League because of a pitcher having to
hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is baserunning and we run the bases
extremely aggressively. That's why I really don't look at it as so
important as what [players] feel I know about the National League
style, it's about what they can do. They've played well against
National League clubs, we have a very balanced lineup and a versatile
club, so we can kind of get some of the offensive matchups we're
looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer and Wooten are counting on it.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>David Eckstein can feel it in his hands.</LD>
<LD>   His small grip usually requires three fingers to clutch a
baseball.</LD>
<LD>   He can grab the World Series ball with two.</LD>
<TE>   "It's smaller, it's harder, it's definitely different," said the
Angel shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Worrell can feel it with his eyes closed.</TE>
<TE>   After Monday's workout, the San Francisco Giant pitcher put his
hands behind his back and asked teammate Jason Schmidt to fill them
with a regular ball and a World Series ball, in no particular order.</TE>
<TE>   "I could pick out the World Series ball right away," Worrell said.
"It was harder."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival is worried he is going to feel it on his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to tarnish anything that is going on," said the
Angel reliever. "But we're talking about guys working 60 feet away
from the plate, and a ball like that flying back at you ... what
happened this year to [Kazuhisa] Ishii wasn't anything to what could
happen now."</TE>
<TE>   Just when you thought this World Series couldn't get any juicier,
players from both teams showed up Monday calling for drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   Of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Players claim the World Series ball is smaller and harder than the
regular-season ball, thus allowing it to fly farther.</TE>
<TE>   Players claim that the four homers hit in the sixth inning or
later in Edison Field's heavy night air -- with the exception of
Barry Bonds' blast -- might not be a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   Players could be paranoid after Sunday's 11-10 Angel victory. Or
weary after the teams tied a Series record by using 11 pitchers in
that game. Or just plain bored on their first day in Cold-And-Dirty
By The Bay.</TE>
<TE>   But most of them are convinced. And many of them are convincing.</TE>
<TE>   "Because my hands are small, the size of the ball is very
important to me, I notice even the slightest difference, and there is
a big difference here," said Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   He said the Angels use similar balls for infield drills, slightly
defective balls that are actually marked, "Practice."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always rooting my hands around in the bag, looking for the
game balls instead of the practice balls, so I can feel which is
which," he said. "We are playing with practice balls."</TE>
<TE>   Several Giants said they noticed the difference during a pregame
autograph session.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Series ball is definitely tighter, I can tell by just
signing it," said Giant pitcher Chad Zerbe.</TE>
<TE>   The players say they don't care, because the ball is the same for
both teams.</TE>
<TE>   But they quietly wonder if they haven't become pawns in baseball's
effort to pander to offensive-minded fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a big deal, it's just the way it is," said Angel
reliever Ben Weber. "People love offense, and maybe baseball just
wants to give them what they want."</TE>
<TE>   Baseball denied any hint of scandal, with Sandy Alderson,
executive vice president, explaining that the 500 dozen stamped World
Series balls underwent the same rigorous tests as other balls.</TE>
<TE>   "We might do a couple of spot checks, but we have no reason to
believe there is anything different about these balls," Alderson
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were so curious, they did their own spot check. Rather,
it was a spot dissection.</TE>
<TE>   During the middle of Sunday night's game, inactive reliever Al
Levine walked into the clubhouse and sliced up two balls with what he
said was a Ginsu knife.</TE>
<TE>   We're not making this up.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody on the team had been talking about it, so I just had to
see for myself," he said with a grin. "I had nothing else to do, and
I had gotten tired of yelling."</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels and Giants were pounding out 28 hits, Levine was
carving up one World Series ball and one regular ball and dumping
their insides on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "The World Series ball was harder to cut," Levine said. "And
inside, the core of the World Series ball was harder when you felt
it."</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the Angels stopped by the clubhouse table and felt the
insides of the balls.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, most of them agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask a simple question -- is the World Series ball harder?
The answer is yes," said Percival.</TE>
<TE>   This being a heavyweight title fight, with everyone wondering if
someone is trying to gain an emotional edge, not everyone agrees.</TE>
<TE>   Said Giant first baseman J.T. Snow: "Would they be saying that
stuff if the score hadn't been 11-10?"</TE>
<TE>   Added teammate Jeff Kent: "Maybe we should check and see if they
are corking that [Francisco] Rodriguez kid's arm."</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying Monday's accusations were some laughs and nudged ribs
and raised eyebrows, but the issue is larger than any inflated fly
ball.</TE>
<TE>   It's not about baseballs, it's about baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Even its own players, on its biggest stage, don't trust it
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine an NFL player slicing up a football at halftime of
the Super Bowl? Or an NBA team stopping a Finals game to announce the
results of an officiating investigation?</TE>
<TE>   Only in baseball, still reeling after a year of contraction and
labor problems, would the game's most charming moments be riddled
with conspiracy theories.</TE>
<TE>   Pssst. Bud Selig ruined memories of last year's classic World
Series with his quick contraction talk, so he's trying to create
another classic.</TE>
<TE>   Shhhh. Worried that nobody east of Las Vegas would watch two
California teams, baseball is trying to produce must-see TV.</TE>
<TE>   Alderson, the baseball boss, heard this and blanched.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'm just glad we're not talking about the umpiring," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Levine, the investigator, heard this and shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, whatever is good for baseball, that's fine with me," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Kent heard everything and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Excuse me," he said, leaving his locker. "I've got to run down
and get my steroids shot."</TE>
<TE>   To which hardened baseball fans, here in the middle of a
splendidly knotted series between two old-fashioned teams, would
undoubtedly respond:</TE>
<TE>   Really?</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>On the one hand, Jarrod Washburn says, it would be best for everybody
if his routine stayed the same, if he got all his rest between
starts, if he waited until Game 5 to pitch again for the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, Washburn says, he saw what Curt Schilling did
last year in the World Series, pitching three times, going as hard as
he could for as long as he could in Games 1, 4 and 7. That's what you
do if you're the ace, the man, the dude who wants to establish
himself as one of the game's elite pitchers.</LD>
<LD>   "I could go," Washburn says. "I'll do it if I'm asked. It's what
you should want at this point of the season, to be out there for a
Game 7 if it's necessary."</LD>
<TE>   The World Series can be a great proving ground or a big dumping
ground. It can make stars, it can wreck spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia knows that.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia has made so few wrong moves this season, it seems silly
to doubt him now.</TE>
<TE>   And Monday, Scioscia said quite emphatically that John Lackey
would be starting Game 4 against the Giants on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that Scioscia hasn't thought about changing his rotation.</TE>
<TE>   There is a big pro. And, of course, there's a con.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obvious," Scioscia said. "You have your best pitcher pitch
three games in the World Series. You have him on the mound if there's
a Game 7. It's certainly something we've looked at. But there is
another side. Do you have confidence in your other pitchers? We do."</TE>
<TE>   And there it is. The big question.</TE>
<TE>   Does it give you nightmares, Angel fans, to think about Kevin
Appier (playoff ERA, 6.23) pitching again in this World Series? Does
it make your stomach jump to picture Ben Weber (playoff ERA, 7.50)
coming in to relieve Appier again? Would you tremble a little if
Ramon Ortiz (playoff ERA, 10.13) started Sunday in Game 7?</TE>
<TE>   Do you want the fate of your team in the timid hands of Appier? Do
you want to see him nibbling around the plate, enticing hitters with
non-sinking sinkers, non-curving curves, non-sliding sliders,
frittering away five-run leads? Do you feel secure with Ortiz -- who
can be brilliant or awful, or both; who can be stoic or unfocused or
emotionally fragile, or all three in the same inning -- if this World
Series comes down to a Game 7?</TE>
<TE>   In the playoffs so far, Washburn (playoff ERA, 3.65) and rookie
Lackey (playoff ERA, 1.46) have been the most reliable Angel
starters, the most aggressive and fearless.</TE>
<TE>   If neither has always been brilliant, both have been at least
adequate and mostly more than that. Lackey was unfazed at being
called into emergency relief duty Sunday when Appier fell apart.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I can still start Wednesday," said Lackey, who made 32
pitches in his 2 1/3-inning relief stint Sunday. "Why wouldn't I? I'd
throw that much on the side anyway, so what's the difference if it's
in a game or not?"</TE>
<TE>   If Lackey does start Wednesday, one can rightfully expect he will
be nonchalantly tough, uncommonly serene and will relentlessly
challenge hitters with his best and hardest stuff, as he has done so
far in the playoffs. Even his Sunday experience, the unexpected
appearance, could benefit Lackey, reinforce his belief in himself.</TE>
<TE>   But then what? If Washburn sticks to his schedule, he'll start
Game 5 on Thursday and wouldn't be able to start Game 7 on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "I could do that," Washburn said. "And if I didn't start, I could
absolutely come out of the bullpen."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn is the Angel ace, the man who should want the ball as
often as possible, whenever possible. And he does. But he is
conflicted. He has pitched on three days' rest twice lately.</TE>
<TE>   Once, he was brilliant, beating Oakland, 1-0, Sept. 17, lasting
eight innings and displaying overpowering pace and control.</TE>
<TE>   The other time, he was tenacious and determined but also on the
edge of being knocked around. This was against the Yankees in Game 4
of the American League division series. Washburn went five innings,
gave up one earned run and six hits and said afterward that he was
"gassed."</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels won the game, the clincher of the series.</TE>
<TE>   "And I got through five innings and kept us in the game," Washburn
said. "So it's not like I was awful."</TE>
<TE>   Even while Scioscia was saying that Lackey would be pitching
Wednesday, he also said that no decisions were unchangeable.</TE>
<TE>   "Things could happen between Games 3 and 4," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, then, if Ortiz has the same kind of awful night tonight
that Appier had Sunday, things will be different.</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Bud Black said, "Look, the pros are that by
pitching him in Game 4, you get Wash out there two more times. The
cons are whether he's physically able to come back on three days'
rest at this point in the season. You just don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "How does his arm feel? Are we better off with a weaker Wash twice
or a strong Wash once? A lot of times, Wash needs his full complement
of rest."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he had confidence that Appier had one more good
start left in him and that Ortiz only needed to "channel his energy
into something positive that will keep him focused." And Ortiz might
be comfortable at hitter-unfriendly Pac Bell and very focused.</TE>
<TE>   But Appier hasn't had a really good start yet in the playoffs, and
whoever figures out how to get Ortiz to "channel his energy"
consistently should get a big World Series share.</TE>
<TE>   If there were a way to get an enthusiastic endorsement from
Washburn, if Washburn felt certain that his arm was up to the strain
and that his mind was too, maybe Black and Scioscia could be
persuaded to give their ace the ball as often as possible this week.</TE>
<TE>   This is only a suggestion, though, maybe a wish, not a demand.</TE>
<TE>   And whichever way it goes, the Angels have to make it work for
them even if they go with pitching by committee in a Game 7.</TE>

<KH>ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS THE WORLD SERIES</KH>
<HD>Room for Improvement</HD>
<DH>Ortiz has battled nerves, gopher balls, but Pac Bell Park's
vast outfield could work in his favor in Game 3 tonight.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN FRANCISCO -- The country was new, the language was new, the food
was new. Airplane travel was fairly new as well, to a minor league
pitcher from the Dominican Republic. So, four years ago, one Angel
pitching prospect asked his parents to look out for another.</LD>
<LD>   Ramon Ortiz was headed from Texas to California, so that doctors
could inspect an injured elbow. The parents of Matt Wise were booked
on the same flight, returning home after watching their son pitch.</LD>
<LD>   Command of a fastball is one thing, command of the English
language quite another. So, Wise told his parents, please make sure
Ortiz boards the correct flight.</LD>
<TE>   "Sure enough, they couldn't find him," Wise said. "He was in line
to get on a plane to Baltimore."</TE>
<TE>   The whole world will be checking in on him tonight, when he starts
Game 3 of the World Series against the San Francisco Giants. He is
thrilled to represent the Angels and happy to tell you so, in his
second language.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very excited," he said. "It will be a special day for me and
my team."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are keeping their fingers crossed that Ortiz can
contain his excitement. In his playoff debut, he was "absolutely too
amped up," in the words of Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, and he did
not survive the third inning against the Yankees. In the league
championship series, he took a deep breath and carried a shutout into
the sixth inning against the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   In the World Series, he has come to Pacific Bell Park, the major
league ballpark perhaps best suited to his game. No major league
pitcher gave up more home runs than Ortiz this season, but in no
ballpark were fewer homers hit than in this one.</TE>
<TE>   "You can make a mistake here," San Francisco first baseman J.T.
Snow said, "and get away with it."</TE>
<TE>   Home runs notwithstanding, Ortiz enjoyed a fine season. He went
15-9 with a 3.77 earned-run average, ranking among league leaders in
strikeouts and innings pitched. He held opponents to a .230 batting
average, bettered only by Pedro Martinez, Derek Lowe and Tim
Wakefield of the Boston Red Sox and 23-game winner Barry Zito of the
Oakland A's.</TE>
<TE>   And, in his second full season in the major leagues, he can answer
his manager in two languages.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm speaking less and less Spanish to him," Scioscia said. "At
first, I would talk to him in Spanish and he would respond in
English. Now he's very comfortable speaking English."</TE>
<TE>   In the clubhouse, and in a restaurant, and at the store.</TE>
<TE>   "He understands the culture," Wise said. "He got himself a
driver's license. I think it's made him more comfortable. And any
time you're more comfortable, it helps with your performance."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, the Angels assigned Ortiz to Class-A Cedar Rapids,
sending the Dominican kid into the heart of Iowa. He lived with an
English-speaking host family, gratefully but sadly.</TE>
<TE>   "The little girl and little boy would talk to me, and I didn't
understand," he said. "It was very hard."</TE>
<TE>   He ate almost daily at McDonald's, because he knew that he could
order a "hamburguesa." At other restaurants, he said, he would wait
to see someone else order a meal that looked good, then he would
point to it and say, "same thing."</TE>
<TE>   If he had ordered a combo meal, the person taking his order would
inevitably ask what he wanted to drink. He would repeat himself, not
knowing any better.</TE>
<TE>   "They would say, orange juice? Coke? What?" Ortiz said. "I didn't
understand. I said, same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, and painfully so at times, he expanded his English
vocabulary. He took language classes. He bought a Spanish-English
dictionary and tried his best to learn a word a day.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch a lot of movies," he said. "And I watch 'SportsCenter' a
lot. I learn a lot. They talk all about baseball."</TE>
<TE>   He eats out a lot too, with a wide vocabulary and major league
meal money too.</TE>
<TE>   "No more McDonald's," he said. "Now I can go anywhere and get
steak or whatever I want. The last three years, nothing like that.
For three years, I didn't eat a steak. It was only McDonald's or
Mexican food -- you know, burritos, and rice and beans.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I like everything -- T-bone steak, pasta, chicken, Caesar
salad. I had never eaten a Caesar salad."</TE>
<TE>   In March, after the Angels renewed his contract, Ortiz knew his
English well enough to ask coach and translator Bobby Ramos to step
aside. All by himself, Ortiz conducted an interview in which he
called his contract offer "very cheap" and wondered aloud whether the
Angels were "not liking me for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ramos: "I was happy that he took charge. He was not afraid.
He really wanted to try to talk directly to you and tell you his
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made strides all around, not only on the field but off the
field. He's more confident. He knows he belongs here. He's not afraid
of making mistakes. He knows he's here to stay. People correct him if
he says something wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels subsequently signed him to a four-year contract. In the
playoffs, during news conferences before the national media, Ramos or
coach Alfredo Griffin serves as a translator.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz understands the difficulty of speaking before television
cameras in a second language, and he appreciates having a coach handy
to explain a phrase or two he might not understand, but he wishes he
could get the chance to conduct a news conference by himself.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to see me try," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In one-on-one interviews, he is engaging, unfailingly patient as
he searches for the right words to describe his pitching or discuss
his family, particularly his father, who is seriously ill with
emphysema.</TE>
<TE>   By no means does English come easily to him. He has an
understandable tendency to repeat his favorite phrases. But, before
the season, he asked the Angels to let him conduct postgame
interviews without a translator.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it was very hard before," he said. "Every time somebody
did it for me, I never learned. This year, I'm not afraid to talk.
It's important for me to be able to talk to you, and everybody.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very good. Now I'm talking to everybody. Now it's more
easy, more comfortable. You say hello to somebody every day. You stay
happy. Sometimes when I wasn't pitching good last year, they didn't
talk to me. I still want everybody to talk to me."</TE>

<HD>MetroStars Get Bradley</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bob Bradley, the only coach the Chicago Fire has had and the man who
led the team to the championship of Major League Soccer and the U.S.
Open Cup title in 1998, will be named coach of the New York/New
Jersey MetroStars today.</LD>
<LD>   The Fire would not comment Monday on the move but the MetroStars
have called a news conference at Madison Square Garden this afternoon
amid widespread reports that Bradley, 44, will be returning to his
native New Jersey.</LD>
<LD>   The Newark Star-Ledger reported that Bradley would replace Octavio
Zambrano, who was fired earlier this month after a league-worst
11-15-2 season.</LD>
<TE>   Bradley, the former Princeton coach who was an assistant under
Bruce Arena at D.C. United in 1996 and '97 before being named
Chicago's coach, has an 82-54-15 record with the Fire and led the
team to the playoffs in each of his five seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Fire and the MetroStars are two of five MLS teams operated by
the Anschutz Entertainment Group.</TE>
<TE>   Nicol Worth Keeping</TE>
<TE>   Steve Nicol, the interim coach who took over the New England
Revolution in midseason and led the team to the MLS championship
game, is expected to be named coach later this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution lost the MLS title game to the Galaxy on Sunday,
1-0 in overtime, but the club's progress under Nicol, 40, has
virtually assured the former Liverpool and Scotland national team
player of the position, club officials said.</TE>
<TE>   A Mexican Record</TE>
<TE>   Jose Cardozo, the Paraguayan striker who has been tearing up the
Mexican league, broke the single-season record for goals when he
scored twice for Toluca in a 6-0 rout of UAG over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The twin strikes brought his total to 20 goals in 14 games,
bettering the mark of 19 set by Uruguayan striker Sebastian Abreu of
Cruz Azul.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy because I owe a lot to Mexican football and
Toluca," Cardozo said. "This team creates a lot of goal chances."</TE>
<TE>   In another league game of note, Chivas of Guadalajara suffered one
of the worst defeats in its history when it was pounded, 7-1, by
UNAM, which got a hat trick from Mariano Trujillo.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela Wins</TE>
<TE>   Goals by Jose Rey and Wilfredo Moreno gave Venezuela a 2-0 victory
over Ecuador in front of 28,000 at Olimpico stadium in Caracas,
Venezuela, Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The victory kept intact the team's 18-month record of not being
beaten at home under Coach Ricardo Paez, who has revived the
country's soccer fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   2006 Set in Stone</TE>
<TE>   The foundation stone was laid Monday in Munich, Germany, for
Allianz Arena, the 66,000-seat stadium that will be one of the
centerpieces of the 2006 World Cup and the site of its opening game.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium will be home to both of the city's Bundesliga teams,
Bayern Munich and TSV 1860, whose respective presidents, Franz
Beckenbauer and Karl-Heinz Wildmoser, were present at the ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "We have waited for this moment for a long time," said
Beckenbauer, who also is chairman of Germany's World Cup organizing
committee.</TE>
<TE>   One feature of the stadium, which will cost $275 million and is
expected to open in April of 2005, is that its walls will have
hundreds of inflatable plastic "cushions," whose colors can be
changed depending on which of Munich's teams is playing at home.</TE>
<TE>   Champions Crowned</TE>
<TE>   Rosenborg Trondheim, whose success has made it one of Norway's
richest clubs, won its 11th consecutive Norwegian league title.</TE>
<TE>   In Finland, meanwhile, HJK Helsinki clinched its first Finnish
league championship since 1997 and its 20th overall.</TE>

<HD>Colts Tamed by Steelers</HD>
<DH>Maddox throws for two touchdowns and Bettis runs for two
before getting injured in Pittsburgh's 28-10 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>PITTSBURGH -- The guy who was once a young man in a hurry is now ...
well, an older man, who looked like he had all the time in the world
on Monday night at Heinz Field. Pittsburgh's offensive line made that
happen for former insurance guy, former Arena Football Leaguer, and
ex-XFL'er Tommy Maddox.</LD>
<LD>   Maddox, 31, returned to the prime time of "Monday Night Football"
for the first time in more than 10 years, throwing for 188 yards and
two touchdowns in Pittsburgh's 28-10 victory against the Indianapolis
Colts. He defined the difference between being not urgent enough and
too urgent, using an example from his UCLA days.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe earlier in my career, maybe I was too urgent with
everything," said Maddox, who was making his first start at home.
"Maybe that's why I came out of school early. I try not to get into
too much of it. You start thinking about things you shouldn't and
start doing things you shouldn't."</LD>
<TE>   For the Steelers (3-3), this was a night of redemption and
reconciliation. Redemption as in pulling the season together,
reaching .500 and a tie atop the AFC North with Baltimore, and easing
some of the previous "Monday Night Football" embarrassment, the 30-14
loss at New England on Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's something about the Colts (4-2) coming to Pittsburgh.
They have not won a game at Pittsburgh since 1968, back when they
were the Baltimore Colts. At home, Pittsburgh has recorded 12
straight victories against the Colts, including the AFC title game in
1995.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it's Bill Cowher. The Steeler coach has a dominating
Monday Night record in home games (10-0).</TE>
<TE>   Reconciliation came in the form of Terry Bradshaw. The Hall of
Fame quarterback made his first appearance at a home game in
Pittsburgh since his retirement and was warmly pulled back into the
Steeler football family with an emotional half-time ceremony, a
montage of his career highlights. He was given a prolonged ovation by
the crowd of 62,800.</TE>
<TE>   You could say Terry handed off to Tommy on this night, but the
Steelers were already clearly in command by halftime, leading, 21-3.
Pittsburgh scored on its first three possessions, racking up a 21-0
lead on a 17-yard touchdown pass from Maddox to wide receiver Hines
Ward and two touchdown runs by Jerome Bettis.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers did not punt until their first drive of the third
quarter, and have not punted in the first half of either of their
last two games.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the fast start was really important," Cowher said.
"Our offense was very sharp, particularly in the first half. We've
got to sustain that level. We cannot be up and down. And that's the
biggest challenge we have right now."</TE>
<TE>   Said Indianapolis Coach Tony Dungy: "The biggest cause for concern
is that we're self-destructing a little bit. We've got to eliminate
that. It's tough. You can't turn the ball over. We didn't stop the
run well enough. Therefore, we put ourselves in a hole."</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis gradually chipped away, cutting the Steeler lead to
21-10 early in the third quarter with Peyton Manning's 41-yard
touchdown pass to Marcus Pollard. But the momentum shifted one last
time when Manning was intercepted by Mike Logan at the 35-yard line
with 6:36 remaining in the third. Logan returned it 46 yards to the
19, and three plays later, the Steelers led, 28-10, on a 14-yard
touchdown pass from Maddox to Ward.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just reading my man coverage," Logan said. "He was in the
backfield. I kind of stepped up there. The linemen were so tall, and
I was so deep in there, and he didn't see me and just threw it up. I
was able to stick these hands up there and grab it."</TE>
<TE>   Of future concern for the Steelers, of course, is the health of
Bettis. The star back suffered a sprained left knee in a pileup on
the second play of the third quarter. He had his knee examined on the
sideline and did not return. Cowher seemed to indicate the injury was
not serious, saying the knee injury to starting center Jeff Hartings
appeared worse.</TE>
<TE>   Bettis' understudy, Amos Zereoue filled in adequately. Maddox was
asked whether the running game is opening up because of his passing.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows? Who cares?" he said, smiling. "I think that's what
offensive football is about. It goes both ways, but I don't know
which one leads the way. Both sides are clicking right now.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel good with seeing the field, with the offense. I feel good
with the guys around me. With the guys we have, it's fun to spread
the ball around. Everything goes back to the offensive line. If we
control the line of scrimmage like we did tonight, we can do a lot of
things offensively."</TE>

<LD>San Francisco is beating Los Angeles in the ratings for the World
Series, but the Angels drew a higher rating in L.A. for Game 2 on
Sunday night than the Lakers did for Game 2 of the NBA Finals in
June.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco beat L.A. 30.9/55 (rating/share) to 26.9/50 for Game
1 on Saturday night, and 35.1/53 to 29.8/47 for Game 2.</LD>
<LD>   The 29.8/47 for Game 2 is better than the 27.8/46 the Lakers drew
in L.A. for Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the New Jersey Nets. But
the four-game NBA Finals averaged 31.8/51 in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   Nationally, the ratings rose 27% from Game 1 to Game 2 but the
overall ratings are down 16% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' dramatic 11-10 victory over the San Francisco Giants
on Sunday night earned a "fast" national rating of 11.9 with a 20%
share of the audience, which translates to 19.4 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 on Saturday night drew a fast national of 9.4/18 with 15.5
million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Final national ratings will not be available until today. If the
9.4/18 holds up it will set a record for lowest rating ever for a
World Series game. The previous low was a 10.4/19 for Game 1 last
year, when Arizona routed the New York Yankees, 9-1.</TE>
<TE>   The previous low rating before that was an 11.3 for the 1997
opener between Cleveland and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   For both games this year at Anaheim, ratings for the metered
markets in the Pacific time zone have increased over last year's but
have decreased in other time zones. The biggest drop-off, 25%, was in
the Eastern time zone.</TE>
<TE>   "After looking at the numbers, it's obvious that the regional
nature of the matchup is having an impact on viewership," said Ed
Goren, Fox Sports president. "But these numbers would be welcomed by
every sports league other than the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Other markets besides San Francisco and Los Angeles where Game 2
drew well were Sacramento (28.6 rating), Phoenix (19.3), San Diego
(19.2), Portland (17.1), Albuquerque (15.5), Las Vegas (15.2),
Memphis (15.2), Minneapolis (15.2), St. Louis (14.9), Seattle (14.5),
and Chicago (13.5).</TE>
<TE>   In New York, the rating was a 10.9.</TE>
