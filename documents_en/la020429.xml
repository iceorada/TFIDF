<HD>Researchers Seek to Trace the Mysterious Origins of
Alzheimer's</HD>
<DH>Aging: Much is known about the disease's devastating
finale. Now its beginnings are sought.</DH>

<LD>The end for the Alzheimer's patient is a horror: The person is mute,
bedridden, adrift from the thoughts and feelings that make up a life.
The brain undergoes an equally disturbing transformation, shrunken by
as much as half, mottled all over with hardened plaques. Where
neurons used to crackle with messages, all that is left are twisted
threads, fittingly referred to by scientists as tombstones.</LD>
<LD>   Now, after years of work detailing this devastating finale, many
scientists are turning to tracking the path of Alzheimer's back to
its roots.</LD>
<LD>   They are scrutinizing how certain proteins gum up the brain
mechanisms needed for memory. They're developing blood tests and
other ways to diagnose Alzheimer's early. Researchers are even
testing whether drugs such as painkillers and estrogen can prevent
the disease.</LD>
<TE>   For a society facing an epidemic of Alzheimer's--an estimated
360,000 new cases each year--getting at these early stages is
critical. But it's also significant because years and possibly even
decades before symptoms surface, subtle changes are already underway
in the brain.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like an iceberg building," said Dr. Dennis Selkoe, a
professor of neurologic diseases at Harvard Medical School. "It takes
a while until it breaks the water."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors want to find a way to intervene. But Alzheimer's raises
some of the most daunting questions in medicine because the condition
takes over the human body's most complex organ: the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years ago, physicians thought Alzheimer's was an inevitable
consequence of aging. But they came to see that only certain people
suffered from what is, in fact, a disease. Its hallmarks are sticky
protein deposits, or plaques, and abnormal tangles in nerve cells.</TE>
<TE>   By killing brain cells, Alzheimer's causes patients--who have
included Ronald Reagan, Iris Murdoch, E.B. White, Rita Hayworth and
Willem de Kooning--to deteriorate to an infant-like state. Their
thinking and memory erode, their personality changes and they
eventually forget to feed or bathe themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "We can tell you in horrifying detail all the later stages of the
disease," said Dr. Marcelle Morrison-Bogorad, associate director of
neuroscience and neuropsychology at the National Institute on Aging.
"Now we're beginning to get a handle on the earliest stages."</TE>
<TE>   Selkoe's study of rats in the April issue of the journal Nature
showed which form of the protein involved in Alzheimer's--beta
amyloid--builds up in the brain. The work proves that the protein
does its damage by interfering with memory circuits.</TE>
<TE>   Many scientists are trying to figure out ways to pick up these and
other brain changes. Researchers have already identified several
genes that can cause Alzheimer's. They have also discovered that some
neuropsychological tests can reveal deficits, such as visual memory
errors, in people who go on to develop the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Some physicians are enhancing imaging techniques so they can see
the microscopic deposits and tangles in the brains of living
patients. Right now there is no way to view this destruction until
autopsy.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow you have to look in there and see if the treatments are
working," said Dr. William Klunk, an associate professor of
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. He and
Dr. Chester Mathis are testing a dye that can penetrate the
blood-brain barrier and highlight the plaques during a PET scan.</TE>
<TE>   In another approach, a recent study suggests that a blood test
might be able to detect Alzheimer's pathology in the brain, even
before a person shows symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Holtzman, an associate professor of neurology at
Washington University School of Medicine, along with Dr. Steven Paul
at the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, reported that intravenously
injecting mice with an antibody to beta amyloid decreases the level
of the harmful protein. Apparently the antibody flushes it from the
brain to the bloodstream. There, the amyloid doesn't appear to cause
any problems--and can be measured.</TE>
<TE>   Other scientists are working their way back even earlier in the
progression of Alzheimer's by trying to prevent it.</TE>
<TE>   About 5% to 10% of people who develop the condition have the
inherited, or familial, form, which means they'll get Alzheimer's
early, between the ages of 40 and 60.</TE>
<TE>   But the bulk of patients with the disease develop it after age 65.
One in 10 adults over 65, and nearly half of those over age 85, have
Alzheimer's. These people's risk is probably influenced by factors
that can be changed, such as environment or diet.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more intriguing avenues scientists are exploring is the
complex relationship between Alzheimer's and heart disease. According
to several studies, lowered blood pressure in midlife seems to
correlate with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's later. At the same time,
other research has shown that the most common type of
cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, might also decrease one's risk
of Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   The findings hold out promise that treatments proved safe and
effective for one major disease could be tapped for another. But
experts aren't expecting easy answers.</TE>
<TE>   "We can describe things, but we can't say how they work. Quite
often our attempts to explain how they work is just sort of skating
over the surface of our ignorance--not because we're stupid but
because there's so much to know," said Morrison-Bogorad of the
National Institute on Aging. "There are huge questions."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists need to figure out why Alzheimer's starts, where it
starts, how it progresses and what can stop it. They have to decipher
why some neurons are vulnerable to the disease and, conversely, what
protective factors enable other nerve cells to survive.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, to help the rest of us ward off Alzheimer's, a
stream of studies suggests such steps as doing crossword puzzles,
taking vitamins and engaging in leisure activities such as watching
movies.</TE>

<LD>Scientists used to think that people have a certain number of fat
cells and, whatever they do, they're stuck with the blighters for
life. But science has marched on, for once with good news. Fat cells
do die after all.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing this, of course, doesn't instantly remove five pounds from
one's rump. And the fact needs qualifying: Fat cells die--but not
very easily, and often they're simply replaced.</LD>
<LD>   Fat cells, as many of us have suspected, are impressively
resilient. They're wonders of nature, a fact that I failed to
properly appreciate in the past. But now, after talking with fat
scientist Susan K. Fried (she studies fat, we mean), I am suitably
awed.</LD>
<TE>   Fried, a Rutgers University professor and a member of the North
American Assn. for the Study of Obesity, got hooked on the science of
fat as a grad student and is still probing the tissue's biology 25
years later. The human body, she informs us, contains 20 billion to
100 billion fat cells. And a gram of fat contains 1 million to 2
million fat cells. Fried knows these things because she's taken
samples of fat from all kinds of people, including herself, and
examined them under the microscope. She even knows what her own fat
cells weigh (0.3 to 0.5 microgram apiece).</TE>
<TE>   Fat cells, Fried explains, balloon when we consume excess calories
so that we have a savings account to draw on during lean times. The
cells slowly get bigger as we chomp on doughnuts and fries and pasta,
accumulating droplets of lipid like there's no tomorrow and inflating
to more than double their original volume. If we lose lard, they
shrink back down.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, any change in calorie intake is easily
accommodated by this concertina-like behavior.  But when people gain
serious weight (say, 50 to 100 pounds or more) and seriously overeat
for at least a month (more, even, than those wild few weeks prior to
Christmas), the fat cells fill up and refuse to swell any further.
They slam the lipid sluice gates shut. Then they send out for
reinforcements.</TE>
<TE>   Help is close at hand--right in the fat tissue, which is really a
medley of cells, Fried says. There are turgid, lipid-filled fat
cells; little round cells called stem cells; and another class of
innocent-looking round ones called "pre- adipocytes."</TE>
<TE>   Innocent they may look, but upon receiving an SOS from the
filled-up fat cells, the preadipocytes cease lolling about,
transmogrify into fat--and start swelling.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have detected no upper limit on the number of pre-
adipocytes that can be recruited this way. ("It's a--I won't say
infinite, but it is a big resource," Fried says.) If researchers can
figure out how that recruitment takes place, they might be able to
develop drugs to intercept the signal and block the formation of new
fat cells in people with serious obesity problems.</TE>
<TE>   Once recruited, fat cells tend to stick around--although they do
die and get replaced at a slow, steady rate. Under some circumstances
there's even a net loss of fat cells. For instance, the cells seem to
die off during the massive weight loss that follows surgery for
obesity.</TE>
<TE>   Fat cells are not merely picky about getting too porcine--they
also hate to get too small. Pick a fat cell, any fat cell, from a
person thin or stout, and it is very unlikely to weigh less than 0.3
to 0.4 microgram, says Fried. Weight loss tends to plateau when fat
cells reach that size. Dieters may still look larger than perpetually
skinny people--because they've got more numbers of fat cells clinging
to their frames. And while they strain to keep dieting, the fat cells
fight back--storing lipids with ever more zest, and stimulating their
owners' appetite via changes in the hormones they produce.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have also learned that not all fat is the same. A
cell's precise qualities vary according to which "fat depot" in the
body it resides in.</TE>
<TE>   Fat from the belly, for instance, is more metabolically active and
will lose and gain lipid more quickly than fat from the thigh. Fat
from viscera (the inside of the abdomen) is even more active than
belly fat. (Scientists would love to know why.)</TE>
<TE>   What's more, "if you transplant fat from one region to another, it
remembers who it is," Fried says. An early hint that this was so came
in the 1960s when a patient with a burned hand was given a graft from
his belly.</TE>
<TE>   When the man gained some weight, the patch of grafted tissue grew
a nifty padding of fat that hands do not normally sport.</TE>
<TE>   One wonders if aesthetic plastic surgeons are tapping into this
new learning. ("All our lip augmentations guaranteed 100%
long-lasting thigh fat!") And should the counterculture ever latch
onto fat grafting for 3-D body art, tongue piercings and tattoos are
going to look mighty tame.</TE>

<LD>Questionnaires are a staple of medical history taking, but
researchers and doctors have long dreamed of getting vital signs
directly from the source--the body itself, heartbeat by heartbeat,
breath by breath. That's the inspiration for a flurry of recent
health monitoring innovations, including pager-like devices that help
track calories, rings with pulse sensors, and high-tech vests wired
to monitor breathing.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Food and Drug Administration approved the LifeShirt
System, a zip-up undershirt and handheld computer made by VivoMetrics
Inc. of Ventura.</LD>
<LD>   The garment, which looks like a cross between a wetsuit top and a
fisherman's vest, monitors about 30 systems, from heart rate and
blood oxygen level to breathing and posture. The readings can be
downloaded into a computer, for use by doctors who want to monitor
patients' vital signs after they leave the office, for instance.</LD>
<TE>   The company expects the device to appeal to doctors studying the
interaction of the heart and lungs, researchers tracking the effect
of new drugs, and physicians tracking sleep problems in their
patients.</TE>
<TE>   Written diaries of sleep habits are not always reliable, and by
tracking respiration the LifeShirt can help diagnose the problem. It
shouldn't keep anyone awake: The vest weighs just 8 ounces,
VivoMetrics says, and you can even throw it in the washing machine.</TE>

<LD>When a mammogram reveals a highly suspicious area, a biopsy is done
quickly to determine if it's malignant. But when there's a subtle
abnormality, the doctor may say, "Come back in six months and we'll
take another look." If it is cancer, that six months may be too long
to wait.</LD>
<LD>   A study of 4,465 Canadian women with breast cancer found that
delaying diagnosis for more than 20 weeks after abnormal screening
tests worsens prognostic factors like tumor size and lymph node
involvement. The screening exams included a mammogram and a clinical
breast exam. In six months to a year, this study showed, a cancer is
likely to be larger than 10 millimeters. And the longer the wait, the
greater the risk that the cancer will have spread to the lymph nodes.</LD>
<LD>   In some cases there was as much as a three-year delay. That's the
kind of waiting game that women with breast cancer inevitably lose.
It's not necessary to do a biopsy on everyone with an abnormal
screening, but lead researcher Ivo A. Olivotto, of the Screening
Mammography Program at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in
Victoria, says, "If the radiologist is iffy, a biopsy is worthwhile.
A delay of six to 12 months can make a difference." (Cancer, 94: 8;
2,143-2,150)</LD>

<TE>   Inhaled Asthma Drug Is Cheaper, Effective Therapy</TE>
<TE>   It's good news when a study shows that the first choice in
treatment is also the least expensive. An analysis of insurance
claims for 781 people with asthma revealed that those taking
fluticasone propionate (Flovent), an inhaled corticosteroid, had
lower medical costs than those taking the oral leukotriene modifiers,
montelukast (Singulair) or zafirlukast (Accolate).</TE>
<TE>   The costs, tracked over a nine-month period, included the price of
the medication and all medical care associated with the illness. All
of the drugs work by decreasing inflammation in the lungs, but
inhaled corticosteroids were recommended as the first choice for mild
and moderate persistent asthma by the National Asthma Education and
Prevention Program in 1997. Since then several clinical trials have
shown that the inhaled drugs are more effective than leukotriene
modifiers, according to an editorial accompanying the study by
University of Florida Health Center authors.</TE>
<TE>   "This analysis of all the costs of care ... points in one
direction: [Flovent] is the most cost-effective in general," said Dev
Pathak, professor of pharmacy at Ohio State University.

<TE>   Exercise-Free Method of Building Muscle in the Works</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be nice to spend your evenings watching TV or reading
and still build fit muscles? That fantasy may one day be a reality
thanks to the recent discovery in animal studies that muscle fibers
can be transformed without exercise into the oxygen-burning,
energizing type that are the pride of marathon runners.</TE>
<TE>   For about 10 years scientists have been studying the chemical
signals that turn muscle fibers that tire easily into
fatigue-resistant ones. One signal that aerobic exercise triggers is
an enzyme that produces more mitochondria, which are cells' energy
factories. Now researchers have genetically engineered mice in which
the enzyme is always turned on. "We found that the muscles of these
animals were transformed. They had several changes that are the same
that you see with exercise," said Rhonda Bassel-Duby, associate
professor of internal medicine at the University of Texas
Southwestern in Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike these genetically engineered mice, people need to sustain
the muscle transforming signals to stay fit. "One reason you lose
your endurance when you stop an exercise program is that the genetic
programming in your muscles swings back," said Bassel-Duby.
Developing a drug that will override our programming is the ultimate
goal, but couch potatoes are not likely to be the first to benefit.
Rather, Bassel-Duby said, she hopes it will help people with serious
conditions like heart failure be able to get up and start walking.

<TE>   'Expectant Management' a Possible Option After Miscarriage</TE>
<TE>   About 15% of pregnancies end abruptly in the first 12 weeks. It's
a sad time, and women who have had an incomplete miscarriage often
have the remaining tissue from the pregnancy surgically removed
promptly. That's yet another trauma, and though complications of a
D&amp;C, or dilatation and curettage, are rare, they happen.</TE>
<TE>   Some obstetricians think women should be offered another choice,
called "expectant management," meaning the woman waits for a while to
see if the tissue will be lost naturally. A recent study of 478 women
in Great Britain who had early miscarriages but retained some of the
tissue found that 81% completed the miscarriage spontaneously, about
half of them within a week. Ultrasound was a valuable tool in
determining which women could undergo "expectant management" and
monitoring their progress. The St. George's Hospital research team in
London writes that more studies on the use of ultrasonography for
this purpose are needed. Expectant management is not unusual in the
United States, and women should be offered the option and informed
about the risks of bleeding and infection, said Alan DeCherney,
professor of obstetrics at UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   The results of this study are consistent with the U.S. experience,
DeCherney says. "Most women can be handled expectantly, but they
shouldn't wait more than two weeks because problems can occur."

<TE>   Hormone Shampoos May Contribute to Precocious Puberty</TE>
<TE>   Are parents inadvertently putting their children on hormone
therapy just by caring for their hair? According to a report in the
British science journal New Scientist, there are at least five
companies making hormone-containing hair care products, and questions
have been raised about whether exposure to the estrogen in them might
trigger premature sexual development in girls.</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, one pediatrician reported that long-term
exposure to estrogen-containing hair care products could be
responsible for precocious puberty. Chandra Tiwary, who was chief of
pediatric endocrinology at the Brooke Army Medical Center in Texas at
the time, found that when the estrogen-containing products were no
longer used in four young children with this condition, breast
development and pubic hair growth regressed in three of them.</TE>
<TE>   Medical causes of early puberty had already been ruled out. But an
anecdotal report like Tiwary's is not proof of an association, and
thus far no scientific studies have been published.</TE>
<TE>   Estrogen can be absorbed through the scalp easily, says Herbert
Burack, a pharmacist who specializes in dermatologic compounding at
Orentreich Medical Group in New York City. "The scalp has a large
surface area; it's like a sieve. From there estrogen can easily get
into the bloodstream," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, products like BB Super Gro are still sold. According to
a recent survey of 130 people at three Seattle clinics, one in five
used hormone-containing hair products, and 85% of them used the same
products on their children. Nearly half of the users were African
American.</TE>

<HD>Prostate Cancer Study Heartening</HD>
<DH>Analysis: Dr. Dean Ornish applies techniques used to
reverse heart disease. But critics are unimpressed.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five years ago Tom McMahon was diagnosed with prostate cancer. "I got
the news and basically withdrew from life," said McMahon, 73, a
retired psychotherapist who lives in San Jose. Nonetheless, McMahon
actively researched possible treatments for his cancer. He talked
with numerous men who had tried surgery (to remove the prostate
gland) or radiation therapy.</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed every one of them experienced something screwy,"
McMahon said. He decided to choose what doctors call "watchful
waiting," monitoring the tumor size through regular physical exams
and testing for prostatic-specific antigen, or PSA, in blood tests.
The concept is that prostate cancer spreads slowly in many men, while
treatments sometimes can result in impotence, incontinence or both.</LD>
<LD>   About a year after diagnosis, McMahon heard about a new study by
Dr. Dean Ornish, the Sausalito-based physician who has so
successfully demonstrated how lifestyle changes (diet, physical
activity, relaxation techniques, support groups) can prevent and
reverse heart disease. Ornish and his colleagues at UC San Francisco
were recruiting men who chose watchful waiting to see if his
program's benefits applied to prostate cancer.</LD>
<TE>   "We didn't have an ethical issue with not treating our
experimental group because these men had chosen non-intervention,"
Ornish said. For his part, McMahon saw his own perfect fit: "I went
to the program to get something. I didn't know what."</TE>
<TE>   Entering the Ornish program, McMahon's PSA reading was nearly 10;
4 or less is normal. PSA doesn't itself indicate cancer but
heightened activity in the prostate. McMahon's doctor found a
palpable tumor by a digital rectal exam and confirmed it with
ultrasound images.</TE>
<TE>   McMahon fervently followed the program, which most famously
requires a diet high in vegetables, fruits and grains and low in any
sorts of fat (less than 10% of daily calories). He takes a walk every
morning either around a lake or in a park, losing himself in the
"awesomeness of creation." He cooks low-fat meals for his wife, who
works at a local health club. Each Thursday, he takes a train to San
Francisco, then "long-hikes" the city to catch a ferry to Ornish's
Preventive Medicine Research Center in Sausalito for workouts,
support therapy and cooking/eating classes. Last May, McMahon
returned home from an extended trip to Europe with one of his two
sons. He went to see his doctor for a routine ultrasound. The news
was good, very good.</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor said, 'I cannot find any evidence that you have a
tumor,'" recalled McMahon, whose PSA has fallen to 7. "I got
reexamined in February this year. The doctor said the same thing. He
couldn't find any trace."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, Ornish presented the one-year data from the
study of 84 men at the International Scientific Conference on
Complementary, Alternative and Integrative Medicine Research at
Harvard University. The findings show a potential new option for men
worried about prostate health--provided they can follow Ornish's
guidelines for diet (soy products replace dairy, no alcohol),
exercise (three hours of aerobic workouts each week), meditation and
relaxation techniques (a daily hour) and weekly support group
meetings. Patients such as McMahon, who closely adhered to the
program (defined as following the program 88% of the time), decreased
PSA readings by 9% in the year. Those men in the experimental group
who had great trouble adhering (less than 58% of the time) observed
increases averaging 6%. Men who were evaluated as "medium adherers"
experienced no change in PSA.</TE>
<TE>   Individuals in the control group, including seven men who received
conventional treatment because their conditions worsened, scored
significantly higher PSAs than did members in the experimental group.
"The results are very much like the cardiac studies when I first
started doing them 25 years ago," Ornish said. "There is a strong
correlation between adherence and positive results."</TE>
<TE>   Some urologists have criticized the study. They say 9% decreases
are not impressive, that a 50% decline would catch their attention.
"You don't need to go down with PSA," Ornish said. "You just need it
not to go up."</TE>
<TE>   Ornish heard similar criticism before when he first introduced his
ideas about reversing heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   The criticism won't stop him from completing four years of
following each study participant. He emphasized that reversing heart
disease and now, perhaps, prostate cancer "takes bigger changes than
most people are recommending or doing."</TE>

<HD>Grapes and Their Juice May Offer Many Low-Calorie Benefits</HD>

<LD>Grapes have probably been around since prehistoric times. Native
Americans, for example, had wild grapes growing along the banks of
streams, but those grapes were very sour. When the Spanish settlers
arrived in California, they brought sweeter varieties with them, and
the offspring of those vines thrive to this day. Grapes are very
adaptable and will grow in many climates. In fact, they grow on six
continents.</LD>
<LD>   Individual varieties of table grapes, which include seedless and
seeded types, are harvested at different times of the year. Some of
the most familiar names include the Black Beauty (late May to early
July); Calmeria (January and February); Cardinal (May through
mid-August); Champagne (September and October); Emperor (August
through March); Flame Seedless (June through December); Thompson
Seedless (June through November). The availability of some seasonal
varieties is extended by imports from Mexico and Chile.</LD>
<LD>   Grapes sweeten as long as they're on the vine, but after they've
been picked, the ripening process stops, so the timing of the harvest
is very important. The process is still done largely by hand to
protect the clusters.</LD>
<TE>   Grapes haven't got much to offer in the way of vitamins, minerals
or even fiber, but they do contain a number of phytochemicals that
are currently the subject of much research into their
cholesterol-lowering effects and their overall heart-protective
qualities.</TE>
<TE>   It's not yet known whether the same positive effects of moderate
red-wine consumption can be obtained by drinking grape juice or
eating grapes. Nonetheless, grapes are fairly low in calories (114
calories in a cup of grapes) and make a great snack or dessert.
Though it might seem that red and purple grapes should be high in
beta carotene, their color actually comes from pigments, not from any
of the carotenoids. These pigments are also the subject of research
into their possible health effects.</TE>
<TE>   Grape juice is made by crushing the grapes (just as in the making
of wine). Also like wine, juice gets its color from the skin, which
is included in the processing. Concord grapes are the main variety
used to make juice, which has an extremely high sugar content and
therefore more calories than some other juices. For example, an
8-ounce glass of grape juice can have between 128 to 155 calories
(depending on whether it is made from concentrate), compared with 100
calories for grapefruit juice and 110 for orange juice.</TE>
<TE>   When you select grapes in the market, make sure that they are not
displayed more than two bunches deep and are kept under
refrigeration. They are easily damaged, and those packaged in plastic
bags or tissue paper are better protected but harder to check before
you buy them.</TE>
<TE>   Most grapes are not picked until they are ripe, but the color can
tell you a lot. Green grapes should be a kind of translucent
yellow-green rather than opaque green. Red grapes should be a nice
crimson color, and blue/black grapes should be almost black. Avoid
any bunches with wrinkled, sticky or off-color grapes.</TE>
<TE>   When you get grapes home, store them in the refrigerator in a
perforated plastic bag. They should keep for about a week. Don't wash
them until you're ready to serve them.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During my first year of medical school, I met an old friend whom I
hadn't seen for years. One of my first patients, she was to teach me
the most important lesson of my medical training: the magic of story.</LD>
<LD>   The first semester had been full of lengthy, regimented,
theory-laden lectures. The topics seemed irrelevant to the daily
practice of medicine or to people's lives. I labored under the
delusion that I could learn it all, or at least collapse valiantly
trying.</LD>
<LD>   As our training progressed, we inched closer to patients. Our
textbook assignments and lectures gave way to case scenarios
discussed in small groups. We met the patients only as anonymous
adults or children referenced by age and gender. We knew nothing
about their lives or who they were as people.</LD>
<TE>   One afternoon this all changed. Our small group was meeting for
our scheduled pathology rounds, looking at the clinical presentations
of diseases through microscopes or on slides of preserved specimens.
It was a beautiful, warm autumn day, and the wind was blowing the
last of the leaves from the trees. I was daydreaming of being
outside, perhaps going for a run, vaguely aware of the discussion
going on in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Then the class turned to the last case study in our handouts. The
patient was a 17-year-old female who had developed knee pain over a
few days to weeks. She was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the femur,
one of the most common bone cancers in teens and young adults. Her
leg was amputated at the hip in an attempt to save her life. Despite
aggressive treatment, she died.</TE>
<TE>   The story sounded familiar. In my thoughts I was suddenly back at
Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, Canada, during the autumn of 1979, my
senior year. In the distance I saw the silhouette of a girl at her
locker, sorting through her backpack and books. She turned, and I
recognized the beaming face of Jocelyn Hutton, a slender brunet with
an infectious smile and a magnetic personality. I had not thought of
her for years.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I had seen her was several months later, around
Christmastime. She had been diagnosed with osteosarcoma. Her leg was
gone. She was in a lot of pain, but her smile was just as
unforgettable. She had told her father that she believed her vocation
was to tell others that it's OK to die. She died a short time after
our last visit. The home she lived in is now a hospice known as
Jocelyn House, in a lovely, quiet neighborhood of Winnipeg.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the classroom, I opened my eyes, and my attention returned
to the slides.</TE>
<TE>   "What year did this case occur?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   The instructor didn't know. "It must have been years ago," she
replied.</TE>
<TE>   My classmates' banter quieted. A few glanced at me, then looked
away. I felt a growing unease in the pit of my stomach, and my heart
rate quickened.</TE>
<TE>   The patient's chest X-ray was displayed, showing lungs filled with
a tumor that had spread from the leg cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the date on the X-ray?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   The instructor looked carefully and said, "1979."</TE>
<TE>   The same year Jocelyn was struck by cancer.</TE>
<TE>   I looked up at the screen once again and stared. The instructor
advanced the slide projector, and a picture of Jocelyn's cancerous,
amputated femur appeared on the screen. Some of my classmates,
realizing that the images displayed on the screen had a connection
with my past, bowed their heads. I continued to see Jocelyn's face
before me as we filed out of the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   I soon found myself out in the concourse by the seminar rooms. I
sat by myself but wasn't alone.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes passed, and then a classmate approached me. "Joel,
who was she?"</TE>
<TE>   "She was a good friend with a beautiful smile," I said.</TE>
<TE>   The gift of Jocelyn's story opened my eyes to people's lives and
their enduring legacies in a way my medical studies never did or
could. Our chance meeting that afternoon, after so many years,
permanently shaped the way I practice medicine.</TE>

<LD>Hospital patients who speak little English face a much greater risk
of medical error or misdiagnosis if they are not provided with an
interpreter, a new study warns.</LD>
<LD>   The Brandeis University report, released Thursday, is based on a
survey of 4,161 uninsured people with limited English proficiency who
were treated between May and August of 2000 at 23 hospitals in 16
cities.</LD>
<LD>   Health researchers compared the experiences of 3,557 uninsured
patients who do not require an interpreter's help with those of 604
patients who do.</LD>
<TE>   The study, "What a Difference an Interpreter Can Make: Health Care
Experiences of Uninsured with Limited English Proficiency," found
that patients with limited English skills who are not supplied an
interpreter at the point of service are far more likely to
misunderstand instructions for the use of medications. The report
called that the most significant risk.</TE>

<LD>"Mastering Memory" (April 8) was an interesting and informative
article--good food for thought. At 28, I thought I was losing my mind
because my memory was not serving me well. Then a doctor suggested
that "the art of retention is attention."</LD>
<LD>   I won't question whether or not memory enhancers including
antioxidants will help in aiding the memory-impaired (I'm no doctor),
but I will continue to give full attention to what I hear, see and
read. At 49, this daily practice has served my memory well.</LD>

<LD>Sadly, "Go Easy on the Hot Dogs" (April 8) omitted some important and
relevant facts. First, using sodium nitrite to cure meats prevents
the deadly food-borne illness botulism. No case of botulism has been
associated with nitrite-cured meats, yet the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention continues to identify cases of
botulism from other foods.</LD>
<LD>   Consumers are wise to remember the advice of the vast majority of
the nutrition and health community: There are no good foods and bad
foods. Moderation is the key to good health.</LD>

<HD>In the Race to Save a Limb, There Isn't Always a Winner</HD>
<DH>Surgery:  Despite great technical advances, doctors must
still battle the blood's tendency to form dangerous clots in
replanted extremities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARRET CONDON</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL>HARTFORD, Conn.</DL>
<LD>Brandy Eddins, 14, lost her forearm in a wood-shop accident on Jan.
11. Later that day, in surgery at Hartford Hospital that went late
into the night, Dr. Andy Caputo reattached the forearm, which had
been cut midway between wrist and elbow.</LD>
<LD>   The difficult surgery was a technical success, and there was every
reason to be optimistic. But when it comes to reattaching upper
limbs--"replanting," in medical jargon--the body has evolved a
response that even sophisticated medicine can't always overcome.
Basically, the body does not want to let blood flow to what it
considers a wound. Physicians must fight to keep blood from clotting
in the replanted part until the blood supply returns to normal.</LD>
<LD>   "The body is trying to repair itself," Caputo said of the
clotting. "We're telling it not to."</LD>
<TE>   In Brandy's case, the replant did not take. Ten days after
surgery, the Meriden, Conn., girl's forearm had to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   Although Americans have become accustomed to medical miracles,
successfully reattaching arms, hands and fingers is part skill and
part luck. The kind of amputation and the location of the cut are
huge factors, as are the condition of the patient, the condition of
the severed part and the speed with which both get into the operating
room.</TE>
<TE>   Caputo, co-director of the hand surgery service at Hartford
Hospital and Connecticut Children's Medical Center, said the success
rate for fingers is about 80%, but it drops to about 60% for forearm
amputations and drops further as amputations get closer to the
shoulder. The more muscle involved, the harder it is to reestablish
blood flow and nerve connections and avoid infection.</TE>
<TE>   After an amputation, physicians first determine whether the
severed upper limb can be replanted. The cleaner the cut, the better.
Ideally, the severed part has been transported in saline-soaked
gauze, in a plastic bag, floating in ice, which helps the part stay
vital longer.</TE>
<TE>   Several early steps must be taken quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides of the sections that will be joined must be cleaned,
and dead tissue must be cut back to help prevent infection. Fresh
blood needs to be supplied to the amputated limb as soon as possible.
If the forearm bones--the radius and ulna--can be quickly reconnected
using screws and plates, this can be done before the ulnar and radial
arteries, which feed the hand, are re-linked. Otherwise a tube or
shunt may be used to infuse the severed part with fresh blood.</TE>
<TE>   What follows is the methodical reconnection of the vessels and
structures that provide blood, function and feeling to the replanted
hand or forearm. Such reconnections were first made possible in the
1960s by the introduction of the operating microscope and the
development of ultra-fine suture materials and needles. Although the
materials make it possible, there is no shortcut. Once the arteries
are connected, four veins must be linked for the outflow of blood. In
Brandy's case, Caputo said repairing the veins and arteries took
about half an hour each.</TE>
<TE>   The surgeon typically works from the deepest vessels to the
surface, connecting tendons that cross near repaired blood vessels so
that certain areas can be closed off quickly. Twenty-five tendons
cross the wrist, said Caputo, but depending on the injury, some may
not be repairable. Nerves in the forearm also are re-linked using
microsurgery.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the nature of the injury, the skin is sutured at the
end of the replant. The surgery is done, but the clock is still
ticking as doctors try to prevent clotting.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the procedure and during recovery, the patient is given
blood-thinning drugs. Caputo said that anything that causes blood
vessels to constrict has to be avoided, so patients are kept warm,
shielded from any source of excitement or worry and prevented from
consuming chocolate or caffeine. There is a ban on cigarette smoking,
which has been shown to significantly lower chances for success.</TE>
<TE>   In the hours and days after surgery, the medical staffers watch
for signs that blood flow is returning to the replanted limb. They
gently press on the replanted hand or finger to see how fast its pink
color returns--a sign that the blood supply is adequate. Withered,
wrinkled fingertips are a sign that arterial blood is blocked.
Doctors can reopen the site and redo the joining of the artery, but
Caputo said that the success rate drops dramatically if this is
attempted more than 24 hours after the original reconnection.</TE>
<TE>   Areas of purplish swelling suggest blocked veins. Physicians may
loosen some of the sutures to relieve pressure and improve blood
flow. If that doesn't work, 2-inch-long leeches may be applied--a
return to a once-discredited medical practice. As the leeches bite,
they inject the area with a natural blood-thinning chemical. Blood is
able to flow from the bite wounds for hours without clotting, taking
pressure off the area and allowing new circulation to be created.
Multiple leeches may be used for days.</TE>

<TE>   Overview: "Close to Home" premiered earlier this year at the
Sundance Film Festival, but the current child-sexual-abuse scandal
embroiling the Catholic Church should heighten interest in this
sobering documentary. The program includes personal accounts of child
sex abuse, including the story of former professional hockey player
Sheldon Kennedy, who was abused during his teenage years by his
hockey coach.</TE>
<TE>   What Works: The program drives home the point that children
usually know and trust their abusers. Children, however, are
reluctant to tell anyone about the abuse, a practice that must change
if child sexual abuse is to be reduced. And given how abuse often
occurs "close to home," the documentary should give parents and
anyone who works with children a reason to ask themselves whether
they are doing everything possible to protect kids.</TE>

<LD>Question: I've lost some weight, but I seem to have reached a
plateau. Is there anything I can do?</LD>
<LD>   JULIE REHNBECK</LD>
<LD>   Santa Fe, N.M.</LD>
<TE>   Answer: To press through your plateau, try training for a
competition. Find a 5-kilometer race or even a half-marathon, and
start training. Other suggestions:</TE>
<TE>   * Incorporate "intervals" into your aerobic exercise. Intervals
are brief periods (about one minute) of more intense exercise mixed
into your regular aerobic sessions. These intervals will increase
your basal metabolic rate, or BMR, causing you to burn more calories
24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   * Exercise daily, even if it's just a walk around the block. Some
people find this easier to do in the mornings; some prefer
afternoons. Regardless, just fit it in.</TE>
<TE>   * Get serious about healthful eating. Planning healthy meals and
snacks takes time, but it's especially important away from home. The
number of calories and fat grams you consume per day is critical to
weight loss. With daily exercise, most people will achieve a healthy
weight loss consuming 1,700 to 2,000 calories, and 25 to 35 fat grams
per day.</TE>

<HD>Late-Late Motherhood</HD>
<DH>The few women who have given birth in their 50s and
60s--with science's help--are making history and changing society.
But for them, the goal was simply to have a child.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her hometown of Highland, at the foot of the San Bernardino
Mountains, Arceli Keh feels she can hide the fact that, at age 63,
she became the oldest woman on record to have a baby.</LD>
<LD>   Keh says few townspeople seem aware of the controversy surrounding
5-year-old Cynthia's 1996 birth, and when people mistake her for
Cynthia's grandmother, she rarely bothers to correct them.</LD>
<LD>   "I just wanted to have a healthy baby and live a quiet life," Keh
says.</LD>
<TE>   But the normality of Keh's life and her desire to blend in belies
her extraordinary quest to have a child--and the resulting impact she
and similar women have had on society and the field of reproductive
medicine. While it appears that raising a child in one's 50s and 60s
is not a choice many women would make--fewer than 300 U.S. women age
50 and older give birth each year--this small group of mothers wields
enormous influence. Their well-publicized successes, Keh's chief
among them, have made pregnancy in one's 40s appear almost young.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there are women who saw Mrs. Keh and say, 'I'm only
51. She was 63,'" says Dr. Richard Paulson, the USC infertility
specialist who helped Keh become pregnant with the use of eggs
donated by a younger woman. "She's the one who makes it so much
easier for the women 15 years younger."</TE>
<TE>   The birth rate to women ages 40 to 44 rose 44% from 1990 to 2000
while the number of births to women ages 45 to 49 reached its highest
number in more than three decades. Among women ages 50 to 54, births
jumped from 174 in 1999 to 255 in 2000, according to the recently
released National Vital Statistics Report, which cites infertility
therapies as one factor behind the increases.</TE>
<TE>   Such births evoke both the nation's fascination with medical
miracles and its empathy for women who want children so badly they're
willing to undertake pregnancy at an advanced age. Reports that
actress Geena Davis gave birth earlier this month at age 46, and
Britain's first lady, Cherie Blair, had a son two years ago at age
45, generated intense interest.</TE>
<TE>   But such late-life pregnancies are not without criticism. Some
social critics and medical experts suggest that the births do not
always take into account the welfare of the child.</TE>
<TE>   And the effect on women is great as well, says Sylvia Ann Hewlett,
founder and president of the National Parenting Assn., which promotes
family-friendly policies in the workplace and communities. The
medical risks and emotional and financial costs of having a baby late
in life are enormous, she warns.</TE>
<TE>   In her new book, "Creating a Life: Professional Women and the
Quest for Children," Hewlett writes that post-50 moms "send a
dangerous message: that women can wait to have children because
technology will be there to save them when they are ready. But for
every 52-year-old woman who succeeds, thousands more waste an
inordinate amount of energy, time, and money."</TE>
<TE>   While in vitro fertilization success rates are 28% per attempt
(one cycle of treatment) for younger women, the success plunges to 8%
per attempt in women age 39 and to 3% for women age 44.</TE>
<TE>   Even the medical specialists who discovered a way for
post-menopausal women to get pregnant (by using a younger woman's
donated eggs) now urge younger women to be realistic about their
chance of bearing a child. Last year, the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine began a public education campaign to raise
awareness that peak fertility occurs in a woman's 20s and that trying
to become pregnant after age 35 can be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   But Keh couldn't care less about what kind of message she sends or
her place in history. Like other older mothers, she was driven by her
deep desire to have a baby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   She Thought She Still Had a Chance</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some women who delay bearing children until well past their
30s, Keh did not arrive at late-late motherhood because of career
demands. She and husband Isagani were married in 1980 in their native
Philippines when she was 47 and he 44. They immigrated to the United
States to be near relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I would still have a chance to have a baby then because
I was under 50," says Keh, granting a rare interview on a recent
afternoon in the couple's home. Keh kept her identity secret when
Cynthia was born and has revealed very little, publicly, about her
family's life until now.</TE>
<TE>   Like many women, Keh mistakenly thought she could still get
pregnant simply because she had not yet completed menopause. Years
passed with no pregnancy, and she came to think she'd never have a
child. But her hopes were renewed when she read about the use of
donor eggs. In 1993, scientists reported that even post-menopausal
women could have a baby through in vitro fertilization if a younger
woman's eggs were used.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought maybe I still had a chance," Keh says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Keh made an appointment at USC's infertility clinic,
which has a liberal policy on treating older women, taking qualified
patients until age 55. Most clinics turn down women older than 50.</TE>
<TE>   Keh arrived bearing medical records that she had altered to put
her age at 51. She was 61.</TE>
<TE>   "I lied," says Keh, who defends her actions by saying, "I felt
young."</TE>
<TE>   Keh retired from her job as a bank secretary and underwent five
cycles of IVF, exhausting the couple's $40,000 retirement savings,
before becoming pregnant.She delivered Cynthia--whom Keh named after
model Cindy Crawford--by Caesarean section on Nov. 7, 1996. Keh had
gained a scant 22 pounds and had navigated the pregnancy with no more
trouble than morning sickness and mild high blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   The Kehs' relatives and friends warmly accepted the couple's
choice. But the public response was not as kind. The remarks ranged
from fears about the unknown medical risks faced by an older woman
giving birth to doubts that a retirement-age parent could adequately
parent a teenager. Others wondered whether such desperation to have a
child was "healthy."</TE>
<TE>   And ethicists questioned the decision to have a baby that the
couple might not live to see graduate from high school. The Kehs
would be 81and 78 when Cynthia receives her diploma.</TE>
<TE>   Public attitudes about late-late motherhood have softened in the
five years since Cynthia's birth, Paulson says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's still controversial but not to the extent it was in
the beginning," he says. While sticking to an age-55 limit for
patients at his clinic, Paulson think it's wrong to deny a woman the
chance to become pregnant based on her age.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you want someone to tell you that you can't have a child
because you're in a particular age group or sexual orientation or
whatever? I don't think we want to do that," he says.</TE>
<TE>   There is also more information now about how such mothers and
their babies fare. And that news is relatively good, Paulson says.</TE>
<TE>   In a study awaiting publication, Paulson examined 78 women age 50
and older who sought treatment at USC from 1991 to 2000. Using donor
eggs, 56 women became pregnant, and 43 gave birth to a total of 58
babies."Besides the question of 'Should you be doing this and is this
the right thing to do?' the fact is that this works very well,"
Paulson says.</TE>
<TE>   The births to post-menopausal women confirm that a woman's uterus
and hormonal system can sustain a pregnancy even after menstruation
ceases and the ovaries stop producing eggs.</TE>
<TE>   The pregnancies are more complicated than those in younger women,
however. About 25% of the women had gestational diabetes, a
potentially serious complication that only about 7% of women in their
20s experience. And 32% of post-50 mothers had high blood pressure, a
rate that is double that of even pregnant women in their 40s.</TE>
<TE>   But because these maternity patients had access to expert medical
care and were considered high-risk because of their age, the problems
were identified promptly, Paulson says. Many of the older mothers
gave birth early (the average was 38 weeks), and most had C-sections.
But the babies averaged a healthy 6 pounds, 9 ounces. Cynthia weighed
6 pounds, 2 ounces.</TE>
<TE>   "The risks are present, but they are not prohibitive," Paulson
says. "Our study provides one more tidbit of information that we have
no scientific reason to oppose pregnancy in women in their 50s."</TE>
<TE>   But there is little known about the lives of these families after
the child's birth. Do much older parents have the energy to tend to a
toddler? Do children care if their parents look like grandparents?
How many children will experience the death of one or both parents
before graduating from high school?</TE>
<TE>   Keh and other older mothers say they have carefully weighed those
questions. The Kehs, who are both retired, will depend on their
extended family to care for Cynthia should they die or become
infirmed. In the meantime, they and Arceli's mother, 90-year-old
Liwayway Solis, dote on the cherubic and shy Cynthia.</TE>
<TE>   The child's crayon drawings are taped to the living room walls,
and the couple proudly show off her new bicycle and Barbie car.
Cynthia, who was crowned a little princess at a local Philippine club
event two years ago, has many friends in kindergarten and loves to
accompany her parents to Circus Circus in Las Vegas. She is obedient,
but silent and unsmiling, when visitors from the media arrive one
recent day after school. Out of the earshot of strangers, however,
she loves to sing, says Arceli Keh, tucking the little girl next to
her during an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a mother keeps you young," says Keh, who says she dyes her
hair to maintain a more youthful appearance. She says she knows that
Cynthia will someday quiz her parents about their age.</TE>
<TE>   "I will tell her that I wanted to have a baby--that 'I wanted
you,'" says Keh of the inevitable question.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For Other Couples, Different Challenges</TE>
<TE>   The Kehs downplay the rigors of late childrearing. But Judy
Bershak, who gave birth at age 50 to daughter Sarah, says it's tough.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had not married a much younger man, I would not have done
this," says Bershak, a Los Angeles teacher who married David Cook, a
lawyer, when she was 44 and he 24. Daughter Sarah is now 5.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt one of us had to have full-out energy," Bershak says. "I
do not roll around on the floor with her. My husband takes her out
and plays ball and rolls around on the floor with her."</TE>
<TE>   Bershak is planning to retire soon to devote her energies to child
rearing. That strategy is also something 57-year-old Marilyn Nolen
says she plans to rely on. The St. Louis woman gave birth to twin
boys two years ago after undergoing treatment at Paulson's clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "I have looked forward to the fact that, when the boys are in
school, I should be retired and can be very involved. I consider that
a blessing," says Nolen, who was a member of the 1968 U.S. Olympic
volleyball team. "Having a family has such a huge impact. People need
to have a lot of support lined up; the cleaning, cooking, shopping,
laundry. We realized we weren't prepared enough. But I think that has
more to do with having twins than my age."</TE>
<TE>   Nolen, now the women's volleyball coach at St. Louis University,
says she believes attitude matters more than age when it comes to
parenthood. She was 42 when she married Randy, who was 36. The couple
spent 12 years undergoing infertility treatments. They even tried to
adopt a child but were told they were too old.</TE>
<TE>   Like her Keh and Bershak, Nolen says her circumstances reflect
that "we just really wanted a family." The desire to have a baby
remains with many childless women long after the prime childbearing
years slip away, says Hewlett. In a 2001 survey of childless career
women ages 41 to 55, Hewlett found that only 14% said they were
childless by choice.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this shows the depth of the baby hunger," she says.</TE>
<TE>   But Hewlett argues that younger women shouldn't think that they
can ignore their prime fertility years and be guaranteed a baby later
in life. In her survey, she found that almost 90% of women ages 28 to
40 believed that assisted reproductive technologies would help them
to get pregnant into their 40s.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying [infertility treatments] don't open up wonderful
opportunities," she says. "I celebrate it. But if women are to make
smart choices they need to have all the information at their
fingertips. Failure is the norm among older women who seek
infertility treatment. And then there is the ordeal. There is a high
rate of miscarriage in older women. I think women should understand
what they might go through."</TE>
<TE>   Age, it seems, is a heartbreaking obstacle to older women who fail
infertility treatment and irrelevant to those who succeed.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense, in talking to them, anecdotally, is that they are all
very happy," Paulson says of his post-50 patients. "It is something
they wanted very much. It's a very select group. They thought about
it, planned it, went to a great deal of trouble for it. They are
motivated to be happy."</TE>
<TE>   Says Keh: "I feel like any other mother does when she calls me
Mom."</TE>

<HD>Roots of Violence May Lie in Damaged Brain Cells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDY FOREMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few weeks ago, two Vermont teenagers, Robert Tulloch and James
Parker, received long prison terms for the slayings of two Dartmouth
College professors. Last month, Andrea Yates, a mentally ill Houston
mother, was convicted of drowning her five children, and David
Westerfield, a self-employed engineer, was charged with the abduction
and murder of 7-year-old Danielle van Dam near San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   These killings, of course, were different in important ways. But
every time one human being kills another, the rest of us are left to
wonder why. For years, the prevailing assumption was that the roots
of violence lie in bad environments and abusive parents, and this
view is still scientifically supported--and politically correct.</LD>
<LD>   In the last several years, however, brain scans and other studies
of the minds of murderers show that there's often another factor:
damage or poor function of the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain
that lies just behind the forehead and eyes. Though brain scan
evidence is not yet widely used in courts, it may soon be. Perhaps
more important, understanding the biological roots of violence may
enable doctors to intervene with drugs, behavior modification or
other techniques to try to offset a person's violent tendencies.</LD>
<TE>   The current theory is that violent impulses originate in deep
regions of the limbic system, or emotional brain, and that it's then
the job of the higher brain regions, specifically the prefrontal
cortex, to decide whether to act on these impulses or not.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, violent impulses seem to arise in the amygdala,
hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray area, says Allan Siegel, a
neuroscientist at the New Jersey Medical School in Newark. In fact,
he says, different parts of the hypothalamus seem to be involved in
different types of violence--the cold, premeditated type (such as
stalking prey) and impulsive acts of rage.</TE>
<TE>   Exciting as the new studies are, several caveats are in order.</TE>
<TE>   First, while damage to the prefrontal cortex may help explain
impulsive violence--sudden rage attacks--it can't truly explain
violence that is premeditated, said Dr. Ronald Schouten, a lawyer and
psychiatrist who heads the law and psychiatry service at
Massachusetts General Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the job of prefrontal lobes is "executive
function," that is, planning, integrating information and generally
serving as a mechanism to control emotional impulses that originate
in deeper brain regions. In other words, if a burglar who
meticulously planned and executed a bank robbery tried to argue that
he was not responsible because of damage to his prefrontal cortex, he
probably would--and certainly should--be laughed out of court.</TE>
<TE>   Second, no matter how compelling brain scan data are, the fact of
brain injury or dysfunction by itself cannot explain violence, says
Dr. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, who teaches psychiatry at New York
University and Yale University.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who has studied hundreds of murderers, stresses that "most
brain-damaged people are not violent, and most people with serious
mental illness are not violent either." What does create a "cocktail
of violence" occurs when a child with brain damage is raised in an
abusive environment and is also prone to psychosis (loss of contact
with reality). Indeed, childhood abuse itself can lead to brain
damage, both from direct head injury and from the brain's emotional
response to abuse, researchers say. Exposure to trauma early in life
can result in a surge of the stress hormone cortisol, which can
affect the structure and function of nerve cells in the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Third, none of the new studies probes the most obvious feature of
violence: that, across cultures, men are far more likely to commit
violent crimes. Citing FBI data from 1998, Lewis notes that in the
U.S., men are eight times more likely than women to commit murder,
nine times more likely to commit armed robbery and four to five times
more likely to commit aggravated assault.</TE>
<TE>   A leading theory for the striking gender difference involves the
hormone testosterone, which is more abundant in men than in women.
Precisely how testosterone may trigger violence in the brain is a
mystery. In animals, considerable data show that aggression is linked
to high testosterone and that castration (surgical removal of the
testicles, which produce the male hormone) decreases aggression.</TE>
<TE>   Research shows that male sex offenders who are castrated are less
likely to repeat their crimes and that men who take body-building
steroids, which are chemically close to testosterone, can become
aggressive. Studies of prisoners--both male and female--also suggest
that aggression is linked to high testosterone levels. So far,
perhaps the most compelling visual evidence for the link between
brain damage and violence is the work of Adrian Raine, a clinical
neuroscientist at USC.</TE>
<TE>   Raine performed PET scans on 41 convicted murderers and 41 other
people of similar age who had no history of violence. In each group,
39 of the 41 people were male. (PET scans, which measure glucose
uptake by brain cells, show which brain regions are most active.) The
murderers had lower glucose metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, a
sign that this region was not functioning as it should to inhibit
aggressive impulses.</TE>
<TE>   The results support previous work by researchers at the University
of Iowa showing that healthy people who suffer damage to the
prefrontal cortex can become impulsive and antisocial. It is also
consistent with years of research by Lewis and Dr. Jonathan Pincus,
chief of neurology at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Washington, D.C., showing that prefrontal damage is linked to violent
behavior. Significantly, when Raine divided the murderers into those
who killed with premeditation and those who killed impulsively, it
was the impulsive killers who showed the poorest functioning in the
prefrontal cortex.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, in murderers' brains, the corpus callosum--a band of
tissue that links the right and left hemispheres--also functioned
poorly. This makes sense, Raine says, because it may mean that the
left hemisphere cannot communicate with the more emotional right
side, thus allowing aggressive impulses to go uncontrolled. Also, the
deep brain regions where scientists believe primitive emotions such
as fear and aggression originate were more active in the brains of
murderers than controls.</TE>
<TE>   In other studies, Raine used MRI technology to scan the brain--a
technique that looks at the structure, as opposed to the functioning,
of different brain regions--to compare people with antisocial
personality disorders with healthy people, others with substance
abuse problems and yet another group with other psychiatric problems.</TE>
<TE>   He found that brain cells within the prefrontal cortex regions of
people with antisocial personality disorder--who show a psychopathic
lack of remorse and a penchant for breaking rules and violent
crime--were on average 11% smaller than those in the other groups,
yet another clue that damage or dysfunction in this area may
predispose people to aggression.</TE>
<TE>   People with antisocial personalities also show other classic signs
of a predisposition to aggression. Research suggests that a low
resting heart rate at age 3 predicts aggression by age 11. In
general, men have lower resting heart rates than women, another
possible clue to the gender differences in aggression.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Raine's studies show that violent people, in general,
exhibit less physiological response to stimuli, including more
sluggish sweating and skin changes, than nonviolent people. This
raises the intriguing possibility that violence may serve as a kind
of rush that jolts the brain toward more normal functioning.</TE>
<TE>   At the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,
Dr. Jordan Grafman, chief of the cognitive neuroscience section, has
studied wounded Vietnam veterans. He found that those with
penetrating head injuries that caused damage to parts of the
prefrontal cortex, as shown on CT scans, were at increased risk for
violent behavior.</TE>
<TE>   After compiling recent studies of violence and the brain in more
than 500 people, University of Wisconsin psychologist Richard
Davidson concluded that violent people have diminished brain activity
in the prefrontal region, while activity in the amygdala is
increased. His findings were published last July in the journal
Science. Moreover, Davidson's compilation confirmed that violent
people may have disrupted functioning of a key brain chemical,
serotonin. The data on violence and serotonin, and especially on the
role of serotonin-boosting antidepressant drugs such as Prozac, is
complicated.</TE>
<TE>   Serotonin is clearly important for impulse control, says Yale
University's Lewis, and animal studies suggest that when serotonin
goes down, vicious behavior increases. The bottom line? Violence is a
complex behavior. The more researchers learn about the neurobiology
of this impulse to harm, the more human beings, with their huge
brains, may find ways to control it.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Horizon Fitness is recalling about 5,900 treadmills
because a malfunction in the electronic control panel can cause rapid
acceleration.</LD>
<LD>   The DeForest, Wis.-based company has received 15 reports of
consumers losing their balance and falling off treadmills, the
Consumer Product Safety Commission said last week.</LD>
<LD>   Horizon Fitness' voluntary recall involves these models: 2000/2001
Paragon, Quantum and Omega. The recall does not include any of the
company's 2002 treadmills.</LD>
<TE>   The safety commission urges consumers to stop using the treadmills
and call Horizon Fitness at (866) 864-3840 or (888) 993-3199 between
9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT Monday through Friday.</TE>

<LD>A recent unpublished but widely reported study found that women who

about the study, I found myself mentally tabulating my weight gain
during pregnancy and feeling dread about something now way beyond my

thought that having been pregnant lowered their risk of breast
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   But the study, presented earlier this month at a meeting of the
American Assn. for Cancer Research in San Francisco, is really an
example of how an interesting study should be seen as a spur to
further research, not as a definitive finding.</LD>
<TE>   In the study, Finnish researchers looked at the records of two
sets of women. First they looked at the weight gain during pregnancy
of 17,360 women who had been pregnant between 1990 and 1993 and found
98 who developed breast cancer before they reached menopause.</TE>
<TE>   Then they looked at weight gain in 4,090 women who had been
pregnant between 1954 and 1963. Of these, 185 went on to develop
breast cancer many years later, when they were post-menopausal. They
found that while there appeared to be no relationship between weight
gain and developing pre-menopausal breast cancer, that was not true
for post-menopausal cancer. Those older women in the second group who
had gained 38 or more pounds during pregnancy had a 40% increased
risk of developing breast cancer years later compared with those who
gained between 26 and 31 pounds, said the lead researcher, Leena
Hilakivi-Clarke, an associate professor of oncology at Georgetown
University in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   There are essentially two theories about why this may be the case,
neither of which can be "proved" in this study. Not just the ovaries
produce estrogen; so do fat cells. One theory is that greater weight
gain during pregnancy exposes already estrogen-drenched and rapidly
changing breast tissue to even more estrogen. This could alter breast
tissue during a time when it is particularly susceptible.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Marc Citron, a member of the steering committee of the Long
Island Breast Cancer Study Project, a federal study looking at the
possible relationship between pesticides and breast cancer, said the
onset of menstruation, pregnancy and menopause are three times in a
woman's life when breast tissue undergoes rapid change. "There may be
certain windows ... when women may be more susceptible to a
carcinogenic stimulus," said Citron, chief of oncology at ProHealth,
a medical group in Lake Success, N.Y. This may be a relatively minor
factor "within the whole totality of different exposures" that
doesn't come into play until a woman is older, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Another possibility is that it is being overweight per se, not the
pregnancy, that confers the risk. Experts have long observed that
overweight or obese women have a higher risk of developing breast
cancer after menopause. The theory is that fat releases
estrogen--even after the ovaries shut down--and more years of
estrogen exposure mean more chances for a genetic mistake that could
lead to cancer. In fact, one of the few known ways a woman can reduce
her risk of post-menopausal breast cancer is to keep a healthy
weight, experts say. The problem is that in this study it is
impossible to deduce which theory might be correct because most of
the women who developed breast cancer were still overweight years
after their pregnancy, Hilakivi-Clarke said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if women who gained at the highest rate and then
lost it all ... still have an increased risk," she said. "I can't
answer that." Others interviewed said that's a key question.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that [too much] weight is a risk for post-menopausal
breast cancer," said Dr. Harold Burstein, a breast oncologist at
Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston. While Burstein said too much
weight gained during pregnancy might prove to have a negative impact
on breast cells, the study should be seen as "suggestive and
interesting" only. Dr. Jeanne Petrek, a breast surgeon at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, agreed. "It could be that
what we're looking at is these women who gained a lot of weight at
pregnancy and stayed heavy," she said, adding that this is when many
women gain and do not lose excess weight.</TE>
<TE>   How does this balance out with the belief that being pregnant
lowers the risk of getting breast cancer? It appears that age is key.
According to one major study, women who had a first full-term
pregnancy before age 20 were half as likely to develop breast cancer
as women who never had a baby or those who had their first child at
age 35 or older. The bottom line, Petrek and others said, is that
women should strive to maintain a reasonable weight during pregnancy
and then take off excess pounds afterward.</TE>

<LD>There's a Malayan proverb that taunts the shortsighted by observing:
"He can see a louse as far away as China, but is unconscious of the
elephant on his nose." I fear, by that measure, that South Pasadena
can't see the elephant on its nose.</LD>
<LD>   I'm talking about a barrier that divides the white-majority city
from the predominantly Latino community of El Sereno. In a noisy
debate regarding the removal of that barrier, I emerged as the louse,
but cultural isolation is the elephant.</LD>
<LD>   If you missed the analogy, let me explain.</LD>
<TE>   In February, I wrote of a plot of land with low walls on either
side that separates Van Horne Avenue in El Sereno from Via del Rey in
South Pasadena. The barrier was created 27 years ago as a supposed
deterrent to heavy traffic, but it is perceived by some as a kind of
Berlin Wall erected to keep out Mexicans.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. City Councilman Nick Pacheco, in whose district El Sereno
falls, condemned the separation and said, "Whether the barrier was a
result of classism or racism, the bottom line is that it wasn't done
for positive reasons."</TE>
<TE>   South Pasadena City Councilman David Rose, who was mayor when the
column appeared, agreed that the barrier ought to be eliminated and
the streets rejoined. He called the perception of racism
"troublesome," adding: "In today's world, no one should keep
neighbors from melding."</TE>
<TE>   After the column appeared Feb. 25, to paraphrase an old Marine
saying, the spit hit the fan.</TE>
<TE>   Then, two weeks ago, when I was abed with the flu, the South
Pasadena City Council, with about 293 of the 300 people present
roaring approval, voted to keep the barrier that divides the two
communities.</TE>
<TE>   But as a token gesture to those on "the other side" who feel
unwanted in South Pasadena because of their brown skin and funny way
of speaking, the city is going to take down the walls and pretty up
the remaining dirt area. Maybe plant some daisies and a few cacti.</TE>
<TE>   But the streets won't be joined.</TE>
<TE>   About 100 people attended the council meeting, with 200 more
watching on closed-circuit television at an outdoor patio. The
meeting featured the kinds of boos and cheers one might expect at a
Laker game, instead of being a session that explored the feelings of
a people who feel unwanted. Even a perception of racism can be
painful, but that subject was hardly mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   I'm told I was called a bigot and a troublemaker at the council
meeting, and compared in more colorful language to the body parts of
humans and animals in messages that came via voicemail, e-mail and
letter mail.</TE>
<TE>   One woman wrote: "People like you make me sick to my stomach and
because of people like you, I want nothing to do with your people." A
man e-mailed: "You and your pals can shove it." He apologized in a
subsequent message and decided that while I need not shove it, I was
still irresponsible. Fair enough.</TE>
<TE>   But the major issue involved in the brouhaha over the barrier
isn't my credibility, my sanity or my ethnicity--even though all have
been called into question. I'm just the louse in China. It's that
elephant on the city's nose that's important.</TE>
<TE>   Two members of the South Pasadena City Council acknowledged the
beast in oblique terms. Dorothy Cohen, who introduced the motion to
take down the walls but keep the barrier, explained, "It's a
psychological thing." Mayor Harry Knapp said the council had to work
to improve the way South Pasadena is perceived.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's a psychological thing all right, Dorothy. There aren't
armed guards at the barrier keeping out anyone from the Other Side.
The perception, the "psychological thing," is in the heads and hearts
of those who feel demeaned by the barrier. And dressing it up with
flowers or park benches isn't going to do a lot to minimize that
feeling.</TE>
<TE>   Many who wrote me said that the walls were intended to prevent
crime. Before the barrier was created, they said, burglaries and
robberies were a frequent occurrence on the sweet side of the walls.
But once the barrier was in place, the crime rate went down because
there was no fast getaway route for the bad guys from El Sereno.</TE>
<TE>   I guess walling oneself in is a way to prevent crime and traffic
and all the attendant evils that accompany population shifts. We can
isolate ourselves with our own kind and feed off the angers that
isolation engenders.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, and maybe it's a dumb idea, joining together to
minimize crime and control traffic might be a better way to achieve
the same ends. I've never met anyone in any Latino community who
favors crime. A merging of goals and dreams could work. It's worth a
try.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time in this country when the Irish were considered
scum, when the Chinese couldn't vote and when blacks had to ride in
the back of the bus. America finally saw the elephant on its nose,
and we improved. But that vote in South Pasadena indicates that we
still have a few elephants to go.</TE>

<DH>Antique dealer helps seniors get a true evaluation of an
heirloom, but it's the tales behind the items she values.</DH>

<LD>The folding tables stretch almost the entire length of the room. The
only decoration is a nearly perfect bouquet of yellow and red roses.
Then, one by one, clutching Mother's silver butter dish or a small,
tattered Bible that once belonged to Great-great-grandfather, the
members of the Eagle Rock Valley Historical Society begin to fill the
table with their personal treasures.</LD>
<LD>   There are no television cameras or long lines waiting for an
expert's attention at this antiques road show, held at the Eagle Rock
Community Cultural Center earlier this month. It's no PBS event, but
people come anyway. They come hoping to discover that they own some
hidden national artifact, but more important, they come to share a
piece of their family's history.</LD>
<LD>   Guest speakers Sharon Hindson and Herman Schahuber of Turnabout,
an antiques consignment store and tearoom in La Canada Flintridge,
field questions about collectibles, from cut glass to kitchen clocks.
When Hindson bought the shop in 1996, she also inherited a road show
tradition that began about 25 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   The previous owners and originators of the Turnabout antiques
shows usually met with small groups in people's homes. Hindson, 47,
and her associate, Schahuber, who was easily coaxed out of his third
retirement to join the Turnabout staff six years ago, now reach a
much larger audience, speaking before church groups and civic
organizations, and find themselves forced to decline more invitations
than they accept.</TE>
<TE>   At this night's event, as the expert team approaches the last few
items on the table to be evaluated, they come to a painted metal
windup toy, a black porter carrying a suitcase in each hand. Barbara
Harsh, 80, brought the toy she had played with as a child, but now
thinks it looks insignificant compared to the Haviland place setting
and the portable writing desk sitting nearby. Politically incorrect,
yes, but the toy is in mint condition, very collectible, and worth
possibly as much as $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Harsh cannot believe it. She explains how she and her sisters
divided their mother's possessions after she was placed in a nursing
home years ago, how this toy was left on a closet shelf in her
mother's home because no one thought it important, how she took it
for sentimental reasons because she couldn't remember a time when it
wasn't part of her childhood.</TE>
<TE>   And Hindson listens. She takes the time to listen to every person,
giving value to what is said regardless of an item's worth. People
need an honest appraisal of their possessions, explains Hindson, but
sometimes all they really want is someone to hear their story.</TE>
<TE>   Her appraisals and road shows are free, a service to the
community, she says. But she is also quick to admit it's good for
business, acknowledging that people often later choose to consign
their items with Turnabout. But, for Hindson, it's never long before
the defining line between business and friendship begins to blur.</TE>
<TE>   Most of her clients are seniors. Some are alone and many have been
forced to make the difficult decision to leave their homes for some
type of assisted-living facility. She often meets them for the first
time as they are coping with the painful process of letting
go--rocking chairs and punch bowls, table linens and porcelain vases,
all the material things that hint at one's life journey. And at a
time when family members or doctors may be telling them what to do,
Hindson continues to listen.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, as people age, one of their greatest fears is
that they will be forced to leave their homes, thus losing touch with
their possessions, their environment and their friends. "Our
surroundings are our security blanket," says Forrest Hong, director
of training and education for LivHOME, an L.A.-based elder-care
company. "And as we become older and our health begins to fail, the
familiarity of our surroundings becomes even more important," he
says. "So when we have to let go of our possessions, it can be very
traumatic."</TE>
<TE>   Hindson has seen those attachments many times. She still speaks
emotionally of a 92-year-old woman whose eyes teared as she handled a
china cup she had painted as a young girl. As the woman prepared to
leave her home, she couldn't imagine anyone else finding value in
such a simple thing she had loved for so long. Hindson refused to
accept the cup, insisting that it was a treasure she needed to keep
for herself.</TE>
<TE>   What she does take on consignment Hindson promises to place in
good homes, understanding that even some cheap dime-store juice
glasses may have significance and need to be passed on to someone who
will appreciate them. The knowledge that even an old set of favorite
glasses will still be valued, says Hong, can be very helpful for
anyone faced with a life-changing transition. One woman mailed
Hindson a handwritten recipe for persimmon cookies, asking that she
pass it on to the person who now owns her kitchen mixer. Hindson did.</TE>
<TE>   A mother of three and an active member in her church, Hindson
approaches each day with a "pay it forward" attitude--delivering a
meal, sending a get-well card, making a phone call to check on the
client she now calls friend. "This is my passion, my mission in life,
to take care of seniors, to make sure that people are not taking
advantage of them," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Today's 70-plus generation often lived simple, frugal lives, and
it's sometimes not until dear Aunt Grace must leave her home that her
family discovers she has money in the bank and that black-and-white
photograph in her bedroom is an original Ansel Adams. Seniors, who
may also be dealing with some degree of memory, hearing or vision
loss, can find themselves extremely vulnerable at this time in their
lives, says Jennifer DeVoll, director of marketing and admissions at
Hollenbeck Home, one of the oldest continuing care-retirement
communities in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hindson has seen all types of people, including friends, family
and, yes, antiques dealers, take advantage of the elderly. She
remembers a phone call she received from a former client who was
concerned about a friend. "This poor woman was being swindled by
neighbors who were coming into her home and buying things well under
value," Hindson says. One neighbor walked away with three Oriental
rugs for $100.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, people don't realize the value of their long-held
possessions. "They don't know the lamp is Tiffany, the glass is
Stueben and the pottery is Rookwood," says Hindson.</TE>
<TE>   For Hindson, every day brings a new discovery. The green pottery
one woman stored in her kitchen cabinet for 50 years is worth
thousands, and the English tea service a man is certain is worth
thousands is not. Either way, Hindson is there to hear the family
story behind it.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Earlier this month, Web sites and some newspapers carried reports
about a German couple in the town of Porta Westfalica who hid in a
furniture store until closing time to put the store's waterbeds to
the sex test.</LD>
<LD>   According to reports, after four hours of lovemaking, the pair,
ages 21 and 17, were caught when they set off alarms while trying to
leave the store. The couple told police that they didn't want to
purchase such a pricey bed without trying it.</LD>
<LD>   Were the young man and woman just meticulous shoppers or were they
suffering from a severe bout of spring fever? Perhaps both, but the
amorous pair seem to have followed what psychologists call a
not-so-unusual human impulse to get physical in a strange, public or
semipublic place.</LD>
<TE>   In February, reports surfaced that some New York University
students were engaging in sexual activity on couches in dormitory
lounges, causing a stir among dorm residents who were trying to
study.</TE>
<TE>   Public sex is not only the province of the young. Last summer, the
retirement community of Sun City West, Ariz., was aflutter when
stories appeared in local newspapers about some retirees who were
seen engaging in sexual activity in public places, including at a
pool, in a park, on a bench, at a spa and in a parked car.</TE>
<TE>   Why leave the comfort of the bedroom? For some people, public sex
is charged with elements of irreverence and risk that can't be had
within the confines of the boudoir, said San Francisco sexologist
Isadora Alman, a licensed marriage and family therapist and author of
"Doing It: Real People Having Really Good Sex" (Conari Press; 2001).</TE>
<TE>   "It is certainly very common," Alman said.</TE>
<TE>   Exhibitionism, novelty and a desire to infuse dull sex with
excitement compel some people to pursue intimacy in unlikely places,
she added. "I knew a couple who kept a list of all the places they
had done it where they might have got caught, and they were all
places that were uncomfortable, but that wasn't the point," said
Alman, who added that the mechanics of such sexual activity are often
a huge obstacle. "The point was there was the possibility they would
get caught. They had done it on top of a speedboat, under the
bleachers during a major league baseball game and in a phone booth."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the publisher of Harlequin romance novels released the
results of an international survey that queried 6,600 people in 20
countries about sexual adventurism. Sixty-six percent of Norwegians
reported having had sexual encounters in public places. Australians
were second (64%), followed by Greeks (60%), Swedes and Argentines
(both 55%) and Germans (47%). Twenty-one percent of Americans
admitted to public frolics, while a mere 13% of French respondents
did.</TE>
<TE>   A 39-year-old Santa Monica woman recalls engaging in various
sexual activities with the man who is now her husband. They used the
bathroom of her mother's house while there for dinner, a theater
bathroom, and her office, where someone could have walked in. "I did
it because I liked shocking myself and him," said the woman, who
asked not to be named. "The sex has a charge to it and heightens the
senses."</TE>
<TE>   The unpredictability of sex in unlikely places may even increase
the pleasure payoff in the brain. Some recent brain-imaging research
suggests that parts of the brain associated with pleasure exhibit a
much stronger response to unexpected pleasure compared with
predictable pleasure.</TE>
<TE>   Research psychologists have also found that couples who engage in
activities that are both novel and "physiologically arousing" report
feeling more content.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing unusual things and things that are physiologically arousing
seems to increase couples' satisfaction and the love that couples
feel toward one another," said Arthur Aron, a professor of psychology
at State University of New York at Stonybrook, who is the author of
numerous studies and surveys examining how novelty and
physiologically arousing activities affect couples. Adventurous sex
he said, "would be an example of that, but there may be other things
going on as well."</TE>
<TE>   For instance, part of what makes public sex so thrilling for one
26-year-old West Hollywood woman is the exhibitionism inherent in the
act. She once had sex on the balcony of a friend's New York City
apartment where the point was to be seen by others. But to her
chagrin, no one noticed.</TE>
<TE>   She and her college boyfriend once had sex in her dorm room in New
York in front of a window that faced a building where a class was
being taught. "We wanted to be seen because my boyfriend thought it
would be really hot," she said. "Nobody saw us, but we left a body
print on the window."</TE>
<TE>   Adventurous sex of this sort is not really about romance,
according to behavior experts. "It is very arousing to have a certain
level of daring and risk," said Shirley Glass, a clinical
psychologist in Owings Mill, Md.</TE>
<TE>   "These couples are looking for the erotic versus the romantic.
They are not satisfied with the usual intimacy so they are
manufacturing it. There is a sense of being partners in crime, too.
There is compatibility there in spirit. The thrill has to do with
getting caught but you don't want to get caught."</TE>
<TE>   Especially in long-term relationships in which sex has become
predictable, sex outside the bedroom may introduce an element of fun
and outrageousness. "Many people who do this are rebelling against
the sameness of their marital duties," said Alman. "If you are trying
to have sex in the bathroom, you can't help but giggle."</TE>

<LD>A GARDEN FROM A</LD>
<LD>   HUNDRED PACKETS OF SEED</LD>
<LD>   By James Fenton</LD>
<TE>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux</TE>
<TE>   136 pages, $18</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Considering the fact that James Fenton is one of England's
better-known contemporary poets, having held the coveted position of
professor of poetry at Oxford from 1994 to 1999, one might perhaps
have imagined that a slim volume bearing his name titled "A Garden
From a Hundred Packets of Seed" would be a collection of his latest
verse. In fact, it's not. This book is literally what it says it is:
advice about growing a garden from a hundred packets of seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this should come as a total surprise to readers familiar
with Fenton's many interests, which include not only poetry and
criticism, but travel, theater, political journalism (he covered the
rise of Pol Pot and the fall of Saigon as a freelance correspondent
in Cambodia and Vietnam) and, yes, gardening. Here, as elsewhere,
Fenton wants to offer a different way of looking at things. Most
people, he believes, think of a garden as something to be designed: a
miniature landscape harmoniously combining features such as trees,
shrubs, hedges, borders, pathways, perhaps even a fountain or pool.</TE>
<TE>   All well and good, but Fenton has a different approach to offer:
Forget landscaping and just concentrate on what you want to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Fenton points to the example of allotment gardening in towns all
over Britain, where a person can rent a plot in a space set aside for
communal horticulture. Allotment gardeners generally plant their
favorite vegetables, herbs, fruits or flowers to enjoy each season,
with no thought of creating a traditional "garden." Fenton would like
to redefine "garden" to encompass anything from Versailles to a box
of morning glories on a fire escape or some Virginia stock in an old
crab shell.</TE>
<TE>   It's not necessary to have a lot of land, spend a lot of money or
worry about the overall design and structure to enjoy the pleasures
of gardening. Forget about trees, bushes and plants, focus on seeds
and flowers. Don't worry about creating something permanent that will
outlast the changing seasons, just sow whatever you'd like to see in
the next few months.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you are planning a more permanent garden on a substantial
plot of land, it might be wise to start with annuals, suggests
Fenton. Besides, for more and more people, the traditional garden is
no longer a real option anyway: "[N]ot every would-be gardener has
the prospect of owning or occupying the same plot of ground for a
large number of years," he notes.</TE>
<TE>   "One moves on. One moves up in the world. One moves down in the
world. One comes home and finds the locks changed and one's luggage
on the street." Fenton proceeds to discuss some of his favorite
flowers and why he likes them. He's a sucker for colors: the intense
blues of delphiniums, cornflowers, borage, gentian, the bright orange
of poppies, the vivid red of a "Pheasant's Eye" ranunculus. He also
likes herbs that can be used in omelets or salads: chives, chervil,
parsley. He loves annuals that behave like perennials, self-seeders,
"flowers that hop around," spreading themselves unpredictably all
over the garden.</TE>
<TE>   Brisk, lively, witty, occasionally a bit arch, Fenton's prose
style brightly conveys his knowledge and enthusiasm. Of a flower
called Venus' Navelwort he writes: "Gray-leaved and with spikes of
white flowers, this twelve-inch annual brings with it thoughts of
broderie anglaise, white needlework on white, the underwear of the
high-minded." Two caveats: For the countless flower-lovers who
delight in the many and wonderful scents of flowers such as jasmine,
rose, gardenia, lilac, violet, sweet pea or lily of the valley, this
book comes up short. "[S]cent is not my strong point," admits Fenton
rather dismissively. And, although Fenton provides a great deal of
specific advice on what, where and when to plant, all of it is geared
to readers living in England.</TE>
<TE>   On the whole, however, Fenton's flexible, pragmatic approach is
certainly one to be welcomed because it opens up the possibility of
gardening to many who might not have thought they had the resources
for it. Although filled with ideas that any gardener might find
helpful, his book is aimed at those who must make do with less, which
is to say, the average person living in our pared-down age, when a
cramped condo with a tiny balcony costs what a handsome house on half
an acre of land once did. Indeed, from this perspective, Fenton's
idea of a garden can be seen as a reflection of what's wrong with
modern life in general: the myriad conditions that prevent people
from putting down roots; the necessity--or sometimes the
preference--for quick gratification rather than long-term stability;
the inability to develop a sense of attachment to any one place. Or,
to quote Fenton, "One moves down in the world."</TE>

<HD>The President's Analyst</HD>
<DH>Robert A. Caro, who's on his third volume on LBJ, has stuck
to his subject and methods as a biographer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ROZZO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>"I'm not amenable to change, you know." Robert A. Caro, the tireless
author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of builder Robert
Moses, "The Power Broker," and now the third volume of his mammoth
"The Years of Lyndon Johnson," is talking on a morning of
record-breaking April heat in his private Manhattan office
overlooking 57th Street.</LD>
<LD>   Impeccably attired in a sharp navy suit offset with a deep-red
tie, and wearing his signature rectangular tortoise-shell glasses,
the 66-year-old, in this suitably low-key 22nd-floor aerie, appears
almost transcendentally oblivious to the murderous heat outside. He's
just as happy to have managed, somehow, to rise above the many
changes that have occurred in the merger-happy, increasingly
bottom-line driven business of publishing and journalism since he
began his 2,571-page-and-counting life of Johnson in 1976.</LD>
<LD>   The first two parts of "The Years of Lyndon Johnson"--"The Path to
Power" and "Means of Ascent"-- were published in 1982 and 1990, and
the long-anticipated third volume, subtitled "Master of the Senate,"
which takes the reader to Johnson's life in 1960, is published this
month by Knopf.</LD>
<TE>   "I consider myself truly blessed," Caro says, his
Manhattan-inflected voice rising from a reflective whisper to a
nearly giddy shout. "I've had the same editor for 30 years, the same
assistant editor for 30 years, and I've had the same woman doing the
ads at Knopf. And the same lawyer too." As Caro reaches into an
old-fashioned wooden in-box on his expansive, clutter-free desk (the
absence of a computer is conspicuous) and retrieves a manuscript page
from "Master of the Senate," he suddenly remembers, "And I've had the
same typist too! The same typist typed 'The Power Broker.' She's been
typing my stuff for 30 years!"</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years ago, as the legend goes, Caro gambled everything to
pursue a book on Moses, New York's imperious urban planner. Caro quit
his job as an investigative reporter at Newsday, and he and his wife,
Ina (who has been Caro's only researcher throughout his career),
mortgaged their Long Island home to supplement the advance on a
project that stretched on like a Triborough Bridge traffic jam and
yet seemed to have virtually no chance of attracting a popular
audience.</TE>
<TE>   Published in 1974, "The Power Broker" was hailed as the first book
to examine how a non-elected public official can wield tremendous
power in the United States. It went on to win the Pulitzer and
Francis Parkman prizes, was named one of the 100 great nonfiction
books of the 20th century by the Modern Library and now appears on
college syllabuses across the country. The book has also been the
target of perennial bids for film rights (which Caro continually
declines, reportedly for fear it won't be done to his liking) and it
continues to sell more and more copies every year. Caro's gamble paid
off.</TE>
<TE>   Now Caro is involved in another, more long-term gamble: whether he
will be able to complete the four-volume LBJ project (which was
originally projected at two volumes, and then three, and now four) in
his lifetime. As Caro talks in his office--a rare resource for the
independent writer and an indication of Caro's determination to be an
investigative historian at the highest professional level--there are
no signs of his slowing down. Indeed, with his courteous Clark Kent
aura, Caro is often described as the quiet superhero of presidential
biographers.</TE>
<TE>   It's fascinating to think of this fastidious Princetonian (friends
affectionately describe him as "still being at Princeton") spending
the bulk of his existence immersed in the life of the man who would
become the 36th president of the United States. The courtly Caro is
nothing like his brash, larger-than-life, mind-bogglingly
contradictory subject--he of the stentorian Texan drawl, piercing
black eyes and elephantine ears; of stolen elections, extramarital
affairs and defecatory exhibitionism; of ruthless arm-twisting, smear
campaigns and the dazzlingly ingratiating backslap; a devout Southern
segregationist who became a fierce civil rights warrior; a one-term
president who personally picked bombing targets in Vietnam while
envisioning a Great Society.</TE>
<TE>   "Master of the Senate" vividly shows how this outsized
character--the youngest and, in Caro's estimation, most powerful
Senate majority leader in history--walked through the Senate's
proverbial china shop like a Texas longhorn. Caro leafs through a
finished copy of the book to find a pertinent passage in which the
junior senator from Texas--who was elected in a 1948 race that was
clearly stolen and whose ignominious details Caro first detailed in
the second volume--is seen bursting through the Senate doors and
racing around the Chamber.</TE>
<TE>   As Caro reads, he stops to point out the proliferation of
participles--"roaming," "grabbing," "walking"--that help capture
Johnson at work. After meticulously building a stage set of staid
civility in the book, and after spending more than a hundred pages
recounting the history of the Senate, Caro begins the boisterous
drama of Johnson's Senate years. It's a drama that will climax, in
1957, with the passage of the first meaningful civil rights
legislation since Reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   This legislative feat, Caro says, would have been impossible
without Johnson's superhuman energy, his mastery of cloakroom power,
his ability to ruthlessly drive home a compromise, and his talent for
destroying opponents. "Certainly in this century, the only time the
Senate worked was the six years he was majority leader," Caro says.
"It was only great when Lyndon Johnson was majority leader."</TE>
<TE>   In Caro's view, had the civil rights bill failed, Johnson's
presidential hopes would have failed too. It was in the Senate that
the dark and bright threads of Johnson's political life--his
unstoppable ambition and his rising sense of compassion--became fully
entwined. "It was Lyndon Johnson," Caro writes, "among all the white
government officials in twentieth-century America, who did the most
to help America's black men and women in their fight for equality and
justice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Research Takes Him to Senate and Texas</TE>
<TE>   "Master of the Senate" is as much about the workings of
legislative power in the United States as it is about Johnson's
Senate tenure, which lasted from 1949 until he landed on the Kennedy
ticket in 1960. (John F. Kennedy, who appears in brief cameos, looks
like a political dilettante next to Johnson.) The Senate, Caro
writes, had traditionally been "a mighty dam standing athwart, and
stemming, the tides of social justice." When Johnson arrived, it was
a notorious redoubt of the segregationist South, where the battle of
Gettysburg was still being fought to filibustered stalemates over
such issues as black Americans' voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the '90s, Caro studied the Senate firsthand; he was, as
he puts it, "the nut in the gallery." Roosting above the chamber, day
after day, like a kid on a never-ending civics class field trip, Caro
watched the likes of Bob Dole and Ted Kennedy while trying to
envision Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John Calhoun, and, eventually,
Lyndon Johnson prowling the Senate floor, addressing the chamber from
the well, and leaning on the oddly Lilliputian mahogany desks that
are a recurring image throughout "Master of the Senate."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the sense of theater that fills the book--the final vote
on the civil rights bill resembles a dazzling premiere, with
Washingtonians arriving in formal evening dress--Caro jokes that the
place where he spent what "probably adds up to years" actually "looks
like a schoolroom--a badly decorated schoolroom."</TE>
<TE>   But this was before he conducted the kind of experiment that has
made him legendary as an obsessive and ingenious researcher: He had
the Senate historian, Richard A. Baker, track down the retired
electrician who lit the chamber in the '50s, well before the
light-saturated era of C-SPAN. With the chamber's lights restored to
their vintage wattage, Caro was blown away by the unexpected majesty
of the place, of its suddenly cavernous aspect, its shadowy nooks and
crannies.</TE>
<TE>   This is the kind of anecdote you hear all the time about Caro.
There's one about how he tracked down every person in Johnson's
grammar-school class, one about his moving to the Texas hill country
for years in order to understand Johnson's upbringing, another about
his trudging through the technical byways of rural electrification to
explain how Johnson, elected to Congress at age 31, brought power to
the Texas outback in the 1930s. (This is the subject of the first
volume, "The Path to Power.")</TE>
<TE>   It's the stuff that wins Caro obsessive fans on Internet message
boards and gets his tiny peer group talking. "Bob is a real,
old-fashioned artist," says Richard Reeves, the syndicated political
columnist and author of acclaimed presidential biographies of John F.
Kennedy and Richard Nixon. Reeves has known Caro for 25 years. "He is
uncompromising and impossible," Reeves adds. "And he's gone to
extraordinary lengths to try to understand things that are far, far
from his own experience."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, there are some who disagree with Caro's
understanding. His heroic portrait of Texas Gov. Coke Stevenson,
Johnson's gentleman-rancher opponent in the stolen 1948 Senate race,
stirred controversy for portraying the politician so glowingly when
it appeared as an excerpt in the New Yorker in 1990, forcing Caro to
issue a lengthy rebuttal in the paperback edition of "Means of
Ascent."</TE>
<TE>   Caro's reliance on his axiom that "power reveals" was recently
taken to task by Michael Wolff in New York magazine for being too
narrow a lens with which to view people. Various ardent Johnson
loyalists--including Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Assn.
of America, who was a special assistant in the Johnson White
House--still refuse to talk to him. And among certain biographers it
is said that members of the history department of his beloved alma
mater look askance at his work.</TE>
<TE>   Caro readily admits that "the academics just really dislike, say,
us," meaning the rarefied cadre of best-selling presidential
biographers that might include himself, Reeves, Edmund Morris and
David McCullough. "There's almost a view that if it's well written it
can't be good history. In my view, it's not good history unless it is
well written. History is a narrative. History is a story. If you're
not telling a story, you're not being faithful to history."</TE>
<TE>   To Caro, academic historians "just don't get" the importance of
good writing. "If you want to work in nonfiction," he insists, "the
prose must be written at the same level as a work of fiction."</TE>
<TE>   Caro's immaculate research is widely celebrated, but his
meticulousness as a stylist is often ignored. As his voice rises
again with boyish enthusiasm, he explains how he spent a recent
summer reading "War and Peace" and "Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire," going back and forth, chapter by chapter, between Tolstoy
and Edward Gibbon. The experiment, Caro says, confirmed a hunch.
"They're both writing at exactly the same level," Caro concluded.
"And that's why Gibbon endures."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Editor Is His Sparring Partner</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Caro's working methods aren't much different from
Tolstoy's or Gibbon's: He has written all of his books, including
"Master of the Senate," in longhand, with black pen on white legal
pads. There's always an outline tacked across the massive bulletin
board that runs along one of his office walls. A typical note to
himself, taped to a desk lamp whose base is a Roman chariot pulled by
two prancing horses, reads, "IS THERE DESPERATION ON THIS PAGE?"</TE>
<TE>   "His writing is very important to him," says Caro's steadfast
editor of 30 years, Robert Gottlieb. "He's a storyteller who's very
interested in character. And I think one of the things that has
helped his books prevail is the very energetic and alive prose."</TE>
<TE>   It might be suggested that Caro's enduring relationship with Gott-
lieb, the former chief editor of Knopf and former editor of the New
Yorker, has helped his work prevail too. Gottlieb is an editor's
editor, the kind of ink-stained workaholic who has become a rare
breed in this era of idea meetings, editorial-advertising collusion
and power lunches.</TE>
<TE>   Gottlieb was the man who convinced Joseph Heller to lose endless
pages from "Catch-22" (and even suggested the book's title), the man
whom Bill Clinton sought out to edit his in-progress presidential
history and the man who's been tussling with Caro over semicolons
ever since "The Power Broker."</TE>
<TE>   "We have these unbelievable angry exchanges, but it's always worth
it to me," Caro says of his relationship with Gottlieb. "Sometimes we
can spend two hours discussing whether to combine two paragraphs."
That's what happens, the 70-year-old Gottlieb says, "when you have
two fanatics in the same room." Reeves recalls that when Gottlieb
left Knopf in 1987 to take over the New Yorker, a reassuring
announcement was issued that Gottlieb would continue to edit Caro,
"as if," Reeves says, "that were a public trust, not a job."</TE>
<TE>   Caro's work has been untainted by the kinds of plagiarism
controversies that have recently hounded such esteemed academic
historians as Stephen E. Ambrose, Doris Kearns Goodwin and Joseph J.
Ellis. Reeves thinks this is because Caro's hard-nosed, unforgiving
background as an investigative reporter--a background that Reeves
also shares--has taught him hard lessons about the necessity of,
essentially, not screwing up.</TE>
<TE>   As for Caro, he declines to comment on other historians' woes,
reverting to his research credo: "If there's one thing I've learned,
it's that you don't know the truth about something until you look
into it for yourself. So I have no comment."</TE>
<TE>   So when can we expect the fourth volume? Caro
believes--optimistically, it might seem--that the conclusion of "The
Years of Lyndon Johnson" will appear in five years, after he and Ina
have moved from their Central Park West apartment to a small Southern
town to help understand the effects of Johnson's civil rights
legislation, and then on to Vietnam, to witness the legacy of the
bombing campaigns Johnson oversaw. With so much work ahead, isn't
there a possibility of a fifth volume? No way, says Gott- lieb,
adding that their working relationship has become considerably more
peaceful. "There's too much to be done," he says frankly. "And
there's less time in which to do it."</TE>
<TE>   When finally complete, "The Years of Lyndon Johnson" will be
nothing less than a sweeping history of politics in 20th century
America through the prism of one of its most notorious practitioners.
Paging through the three doorstop volumes, one finds each has
parallels to recent events: the Florida election fiasco, Enron,
Whitewater. It augurs well for the endurance of Caro's
lifetime-consuming work, and validates the unchanging rituals that
have sustained what Gott- lieb calls Caro's "amazing accomplishment."
Having spent 26 years in nearly daily communion with Johnson--a man
whose chicanery he has fearlessly exposed and whose greatness he has
unapologetically compared to Abraham Lincoln's--does Caro ever
fantasize about writing about something, anything, else?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," he replies, eyes lighting up. "I have another topic. But I
don't want to say what it is because I don't want to jinx myself."
There's a subtle pause. "Because you always wonder if you're going to
live long enough to do it."</TE>

<LD>Margays</LD>
<LD>   When you think of wild cats, you probably picture a lion or
tiger--something much larger than a house cat. But of the 36 species
of wild cats, many are smaller than house cats, including margays.</LD>
<LD>   Margays are found in forested regions. In South and Central
America, the smaller margays and ocelots share territory with the
larger jaguars. It is not unusual for several wild cat species to
share a common area so they can catch prey of different sizes.</LD>
<TE>   Margays eat rats, birds, frogs, insects and monkeys. They are more
arboreal (use trees more) than other cats. They hunt and sleep in
trees. One special adaptation they have for life in trees is that the
ankles of their back feet can rotate 180 degrees, allowing them to
climb down tree trunks head first, like squirrels. These felines
weigh only about 7 pounds on average. They are mostly active at
night. They have black-ringed rosettes and long black blotches on tan

<TE>   "Falling Up"</TE>
<TE>   by Shel Silverstein</TE>
<TE>   This book is a collection of poems. The one I like best is also
called "Falling Up." My favorite part is where the boy says, "I got
sick to my stomach and threw down." I liked the poem because
everything in it is backward.</TE>

<LD>Every day after school I walk exactly 43 steps from the bus stop to
my front door. Most days the things I see are exactly the same. I
always run my hand along the fence. Bump. Bump. Bump.</LD>
<LD>   Today is different. I run my hand along the fence, but instead of
hearing bump, bump, bump, I hear meow, meow, meow.</LD>
<LD>   I look down, and at my feet is a kitten. He is stuck, so I help
him wiggle free, carefully, so he won't scratch me. I see that he is
hurt, so I wrap him in my sweater. I think hard about what to do.
Then I remember that a veterinarian lives next door to me. She says
hello to my mother and me every morning when we leave the house.</LD>
<TE>   I bring the kitten to her door and tell her what happened. She
takes a look at the kitten.</TE>
<TE>   "You did the right thing," the vet tells me. "You saved this
kitten's life."</TE>
<TE>   "Mama will not let me have a kitten," I say sadly.</TE>
<TE>   "Meow!" the kitten says, licking its paw happily.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning before school, I go to the vet's porch and visit
the kitten. Mama is with me. The kitten jumps into my arms and purrs.
He looks just like a cinnamon roll.</TE>
<TE>   "What's this?" Mama says, surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Cinnamon!" I say, and since I've named him, she lets me
keep him.</TE>

<HD>His Faith in Peace Endures</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Nobelist Elie Wiesel worries where the escalating
violence will lead, but he's also convinced Palestinians and Israelis
can live as neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An optimist even in the worst of times, Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie
Wiesel is very pessimistic these days. "The world has never been in
such danger," he said last week during a visit to Los Angeles. "We
are on a train, running toward the abyss. All we can do is pull the
alarm to stop it."</LD>
<LD>   A peace activist, graduate of the Sorbonne and survivor of Nazi
concentration camps, Wiesel was in town last week for a dinner to
honor Rabbi Allen Freehling, who is changing roles from senior rabbi
to emeritus at the University Synagogue on the Westside.</LD>
<LD>   Moments after Wiesel arrived here from New York, where he lives
with his wife, Marion, he had already spread his notebooks and pens
across a desk in his hotel suite. With 30 books promoting peace and
tolerance to his credit, including "Night," his 1960 autobiographical
novel about life inside Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and with a lecture
schedule that could wear down a man half his 73 years, Wiesel is
often described as the most important Jew in America.</LD>
<TE>   He is a slight figure, hardly more than 5 feet 5, with delicate
features and the gracious manners of the Old World. Born in Romania,
he lived in France for many years and still writes his books in
French. Even when he is criticizing governments or predicting the eve
of destruction, he seems bemused or resigned more often than
hardened.</TE>
<TE>   His constant efforts to promote peace and tolerance have not made
him a pacifist, a fact that has been especially evident lately.
Wiesel supports the current Israeli military campaign, including the
recent incursion into the West Bank Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin
in response to a rash of suicide bombings by Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if [Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon's actions were too
much or not enough, I'm not a military person," he said. "If he asked
me what to do, I would not know what to advise him. I'd have to say,
'Go ahead. Do what you are doing.'" And, he added. "I think what he
is doing has made a difference. Since the invasion, there have been
fewer suicide killings."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians who turn themselves into human bombs have gone beyond
the rules of war or terrorism, Wiesel said. "Even terrorism has
limits. One cannot do certain things and still remain a human being."</TE>
<TE>   Focused, as always, on the larger issues, he worries about the
global impact of escalating violence in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "Suicide killings in Israel could start a chain reaction around
the world," he said. "There is nothing easier than to strap on a belt
of explosives, walk into a crowd and pull the detonating cord. The
first step toward peace talks is to stop the suicide killings."</TE>
<TE>   Government leaders haven't been able to stop these attacks. And
the international peacekeeping force that some experts have proposed
might keep the army from attacking, Wiesel said, but not the
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "The end of terrorism must come from the spiritual leaders of
Islam," he said. "A fatwa from Muslim spiritual leaders saying that
suicide killings can no longer take place would make a difference.
When the killing stops, negotiations for peace can begin."</TE>
<TE>   Wiesel calls his own proposal for the Middle East a utopian vision
worth taking seriously. He would create an exchange program for
students from kindergarten through professional school age. "Israeli
and Palestinian children should visit each other's schools once every
month, go back and forth," he said. "Start from the bottom up, the
youngest children first. It would be the beginning of human
relationships. They would get to know each other as human beings."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of politicians, he would ask a team of Nobel peace
laureates to host the next round of negotiations. The results would
be unlike anything that exists now. "There should be a new,
Palestinian state created," he said. "I think there will be one."</TE>
<TE>   Even after the current outbreak of violence, Wiesel believes Arabs
and Israelis are capable of living as neighbors. "If Israel could
make peace with Germany after World War II," he says, "it can make
peace with Palestine." Human limitations might help where high ideals
have failed. "People get tired," Wiesel said. "The Middle East will
get tired of fighting and killing. There will be peace."</TE>
<TE>   His outspoken support for Israel and mistrust of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat, whom he refers to as a terrorist,
has filled his mailbox with hate letters. Destruction of Jewish grave
sites in a cemetery in France this month, he said, confirm what the
letters tell him. Anti-Semitism is on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   The etiquette of hate has changed. "Today, people sign their names
and include their return address," he said. "They feel it is
perfectly all right to hate me because I am a Jew and I say what I
think about Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Wiesel was invited to speak at Freehling's retirement dinner, in
part because both have worked hard to promote dialogue and tolerance
between Arabs and Jews. Freehling has been the moderator of a
Muslim-Jewish dialogue group in Los Angeles that has persevered
despite several near-collapses since it was formed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Freehling agrees with Wiesel on some points. "I'm convinced that
both sides will conclude there's been enough bloodshed and death," he
said. But Freehling does not support either side's current tactics.
"The difficulty now is in finding negotiating partners who trust one
another. It may require new leadership on both sides. And that will
take time."</TE>
<TE>   As Wiesel stepped up to the podium at Freehling's tribute dinner,
an audience of close to 600 people rose to greet him. He seemed to
represent their highest ideals for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Hope is not something we can discard," he assured them. "The soul
cannot live without it. We don't see the way out in Israel right now.
But there will be peace. Simply because we cannot live without it.
And neither can they."</TE>

<HD>A Celebration of the 'Bandstand' Beat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Compiled by Times staff writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's got a good beat and you can dance to it--or at least you could
in the good old days. "American Bandstand" was the first network
television show devoted to rock 'n' roll, and its legacy will be
feted Friday with "American Bandstand's 50th ... A Celebration" on
ABC at 8 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The show that gave initial national exposure to Chuck Berry and
Buddy Holly and had memorable early-career visits by Madonna and
Prince will provide plenty of vintage footage, and there are some
quirky new performances as well, including an "all star" band with
Jim Belushi, Jerry Springer, Leif Garrett and others backing Little
Richard.</LD>
<LD>   Performances probably more meaningful to pop fans will be by
Stevie Wonder, Babyface, Alanis Morissette and Cher.</LD>
<TE>   The most intriguing performer is Michael Jackson, and not just for
the usual reasons. The self-styled King of Pop was a performance pawn
of sorts in a recent feud between the Grammys and the American Music
Awards, the latter the baby of "Bandstand's" Dick Clark. Clark filed
a lawsuit last year claiming that the Grammys leadership unfairly
pressured Jackson to skip out on the rival American Music Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Clark says the battle with the Grammys continues but adds that
Jackson "has been a friend for years, since his childhood" and that
his appearance on the "Bandstand" special is unrelated. While Clark
is usually eager to outline his animus toward the Grammys, it was
clear in an interview last week that the anniversary show was his
focus of the moment. "This old girl is special to me," he says. "A
lot of history."</TE>
<TE>   The show began in 1952 in Philadelphia, and Clark, a young radio
personality at the time, came on board in 1956 (the previous host was
ousted after a driving-under-the-influence charge) and soon became a
famous face among pop fans.</TE>
<TE>   Any regrets through the years? Clark says he agreed to ax the show
in late 1989 because it had become a sad shadow of itself. Now,
though, the man with an ear for history wishes he had hung on a few
months longer so the show would have aired through five decades. "Can
you imagine that? I've been really sorry I didn't think of that
then."</TE>

<LD>How's this for a mismatch: Woody Allen versus Spider-Man.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, that's the bizarre scenario Hollywood is conjuring up this
weekend as the chattering, bespectacled, reed-thin comedian goes
head-to-head against the comic book webslinger in a titanic battle of
the box office. Well, maybe not so titanic.</LD>
<LD>   On paper, it's the biggest mismatch since Lyndon B. Johnson versus
Barry Goldwater in 1964. "Spider-Man" opens Friday in more than 3,000
theaters; Allen's new comedy, "Hollywood Ending," premieres in about
750.</LD>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" is geared to excitable 14-year-old boys. "Hollywood
Ending" is geared to pseudo-intellectuals who like nothing better
than to engage in a debate over the last time a Woody Allen movie was
funny.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem odd that DreamWorks is releasing "Hollywood Ending"
the same weekend that "Spider-Man" spins his web, but the theory is
that moviegoers who aren't into Saturday matinee popcorn fare should
be offered something completely different.</TE>
<TE>   DreamWorks plans to do something similar around the time that
"Star Wars: Episode II--Attack of the Clones" comes out on May 16.
Because the George Lucas film is expected to appeal mainly to boys,
DreamWorks is planning to release "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron,"
a film expected to appeal mainly to girls, on May 24.</TE>
<TE>   As for Allen, even he would admit he's no Spider-Man. His last
film, "The Curse of the Jade Scorpion," grossed a meager $7.5
million. Before that, "Small Time Crooks" took in $17.3 million. But
Allen has his loyal fan base, the French are eagerly waiting for
"Hollywood Endings" to open this year's Cannes Film Festival, and
Allen hasn't yet completed his three-picture deal with DreamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   So, sit back and try to imagine Allen swinging on a web through
the concrete canyons of his beloved New York, zapping villains,
mesmerizing damsels, saving people in distress. Hey, Hollywood has
seen stranger sights.</TE>

<HD>Female Acts Tough to Beat on Fest's Day One</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>During the daylight hours on Day One of the Coachella Valley Music &amp;
Arts Festival on Saturday, the musical environments were as eclectic
as the lineup at the Empire Polo Field.</LD>
<LD>   The performances under the sun by singer-songwriter Pete Yorn, new
indie hero Jack Johnson, jam band-flavored G Love &amp; Special Sauce,
L.A.'s Forest for the Trees (with a sound that incorporated bagpipes,
strings and hip-hop) and a surprisingly jangly Cornershop gave the
late-afternoon main stage area a Sunday-in-the-park vibe.</LD>
<LD>   To the many that packed the Mojave Tent to see the Pharcyde or
earlier surrounded the main stage while New York rapper KRS-One
delivered his hip-hop rules in a gruff, authoritative voice, hip-hop
was the order of the day.</LD>
<TE>   And hundreds of electronic music enthusiasts turned the Sahara
Tent into an afternoon dance club while such DJs as Lee Burridge and
Miguel Migs filled the room with inviting female vocals and sunny
grooves.</TE>
<TE>   After the sun set, though, and the headliners began to take their
places, the day came more into focus. This one was about women and
the beat taking charge.</TE>
<TE>   Given the paucity of female acts on this year's package tours, the
fact that three slots on the main stage (Princess Superstar, Bjork
and the veteran English goth band Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees) went to
women is noteworthy.</TE>
<TE>   Siouxsie Sioux led her Banshees, reunited for a brief run of
shows, through a dark, guitar-rich set marked by Sioux's volatility.
She was captivating as she commanded the stage with dramatic and
forceful movements, but some angry comments, including two at the
corporate nature of the festival, seemed to come from out of nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Bjork, on the other hand, seemed genuinely pleased with the
adoration heaped on her by the fans, repeatedly thanking the throng,
which stretched as far as the eye could see. Given the intimate
nature of the Icelandic singer's music, it was a pleasant surprise
how well the drama and emotion of songs from last year's brilliant CD
"Vespertine," augmented by a string section and electronic
programming, carried in the large venue.</TE>
<TE>   Headlining the main stage were the Chemical Brothers, whose new
album, "Come With Us," was made for this setting. Full of large
beats, explosive synthesizers and intoxicating percussion, it's a
dance album made for arena rock, and as the grooves of "It Began in
Afrika" filled the night sky, Ed Simons and Tom Rowland pounded their
keyboards and computers like mad scientists.</TE>
<TE>   While the Chemical Brothers reveled in their role as headliners,
the always-inspired Sasha &amp; Digweed took the Sahara Tent to another
world with their own blend of rising trance segues and world-flavored
percussion. On another day, their two-hour-plus set would have
reigned supreme, but with women and beats holding Saturday's bragging
rights, it was only fitting that the day's zenith came from an act
that mixed the two.</TE>
<TE>   English drum-and-bass group Kosheen dazzled the Mojave Tent with
an hourlong set that obliterated the idea of what a live electronic
show can be. Mixing the showmanship and Chrissie Hynde-like attitude
of singer Sian Evans with infectious hooks, Kosheen had a blast on
stage, and insisted the audience do the same.</TE>
<TE>   What made the performance truly special, though, was the band's
daring. In a genre where stopping the beat is a no-no, Kosheen slowed
the tempo with great effectiveness at key points. If a festival can
deliver one truly great set and a series of strong performances
around it, the day is a success. With Kosheen at the center, and the
likes of touted newcomers the Vines, whose blistering punk ethos and
short but sweet power-rockers will make a lot of noise this summer,
on the periphery, Day One of Coachella 2002 was a memorable one.</TE>

<HD>In the Coachella Spirit</HD>
<DH>Two-day festival features mainstream stars performing
along with the obscure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFF BOUCHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIO</DL>
<LD>It was just one among dozens of singular musical moments at the third
Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, but the frenzied Saturday
night set by a turntable wizard named Z-Trip seemed to encapsulate
the defining ambitions of this massive music gathering in the desert.</LD>
<LD>   Weaving, grafting and scratching, Z-Trip created a vinyl collage
of disparate music (Who would expect Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean"
and Rage Against the Machine's "Testify" to lend themselves to
merger?) that had fans howling and bobbing. He closed his set with a
Beck song--and Beck himself. The singer, bearded and breakdancing
with a guitarist in tow, leaped on stage to sing over his own sample,
and send the crowd over the top.</LD>
<LD>   That slice of performance not only spoke to the festival's
aspirations to become an industrial-sized sampler of both rock and
electronic dance flavor, but also summed up the Coachella ideal of
placing stars with mainstream clout alongside obscure
experimentalists.</LD>
<TE>   The approach has won over fans--this year's edition appeared to be
on track to make its first profit, and the announced Saturday
attendance of 30,000 was a single-day record for the event--and made
the show one where artists come to check out other artists. "There's
one big pot out here, stirring it up," said Chaly 2na, the frontman
of acclaimed hip-hop collective Jurassic 5, one of the numerous Los
Angeles acts performing. "You want to see what everybody's doing,
too. I just checked out KRS-One and it was amazing."</TE>
<TE>   The first half of the two-day show unfolded under picture-perfect
weather, and despite some vicious early afternoon traffic snarls on
the overwhelmed surface streets of this small desert city, 125 miles
east of Los Angeles, the event proceeded without any major logistical
bumps or bruises.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 50 acts were scheduled to perform from noon to midnight on
five stages over the weekend, including major names such as Bjork,
Oasis, the Prodigy and the Foo Fighters. The fan favorite on Saturday
night seemed to be the show-closing set by the Chemical Brothers, who
returned to Coachella for their third visit.</TE>
<TE>   If the British duo looked out on the crowd, they saw the familiar
sights of nighttime Coachella: the friendly chaos of thousands of
fans dancing, kicking back on blankets or, most commonly, navigating
their way to the next stage to catch as many glimpses of different
performances as possible.</TE>
<TE>   After the crowd reached peak size under the amber full moon, it
was impossible in most areas to walk three paces in any direction
without colliding with someone. The mash of music from each stage
could be heard in the field's center, and squiggles of light from the
ubiquitous glow-sticks dotted the night.The crowd itself is part of
the pop culture collage, and totems from different eras abounded,
from tie-dyed shirts and disco outfits to Hacky Sacks and the
fanciful rave scene regalia. The quick currents and drifts of the pop
world could be seen not only on stages--Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees one
day, the Strokes the next--but in the crowd, with ghosts of MTV past
and present wandering by in the form of original VJ Mark Goodman and
"The Osbournes" family member Kelly Osbourne.</TE>
<TE>   The median age for the third edition of Coachella seemed to skew
older than in previous years, with more fans in their 20s and 30s who
came with eclectic allegiances. "You see the kids that are into rock,
then you see the emo kids or the rave kids and the hip-hop fans--this
is the ideal kind of concert, really, the kind of show I'd love to
see more of," said Mike Shinoda, MC/vocalist from Linkin Park,
playing the part of music fan for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Shinoda and his group finished 2001 with the year's best-selling
U.S. album and they are a powerhouse in radio--placing them in a pop
landscape far removed from most of the Coachella acts. More common
are "buzz" acts, such as Icelandic curiosity Sigur Ros last year or,
on Saturday night, the Vines, an Australian rock band that many
expect to fit nicely into the spare, no-frills guitar rock movement
spearheaded by the Strokes and the White Stripes.</TE>
<TE>   But Saturday night, despite the contortions and caterwauls of
charismatic singer Craig Nicholls, the crowd that packed into a tent
to see the group largely stood stiff-kneed and blank-faced. It was
late, and after a full day of music and sun, the hardiest Coachella
fans were off with the dance groups, and the rock explorers looked
spent. "They made an effort to come see us at least," Vines bassist
Patrick Matthews said with a shrug afterward. It was the group's
first festival show and only their second U.S. date.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Johnson, the Santa Barbara-based singer-songwriter, has more
performances under his belt than the young Vines, and he said that
festival advantages such as the size of the audience can be countered
by the crowd's divided attention.</TE>
<TE>   "You get spoiled playing your own shows, and you have to go into a
festival with an open mind and realize a lot of people are
positioning themselves for a band or two down the line," Johnson said
with a chuckle. "As long as you aren't getting booed, though, that's
cool. You do look out there and make eye contact with people, and you
know they're just waiting [for another act]. But I can't blame them.
There's a lot to see."</TE>

<HD>'Scorpion's' Days at No. 1 May Be Numbered</HD>
<DH>Box Office * The 'King' rules for the second consecutive
weekend, but the release of 'Spider-Man' on Friday figures to put an
end to the Rock's reign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID GERMAIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Scorpion King" ruled the box office for a second consecutive
weekend with $17.6 million, but its reign is likely to end with the
arrival of another hero that's part man, part bug.</LD>
<LD>   One of the most hotly awaited comic-book adaptations ever,
"Spider-Man" opens next weekend and is expected to put an early spin
on the summer blockbuster season. "It's a total summer movie," said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor
Relations.</LD>
<LD>   "Scorpion King" distributor Universal chose to slip its action
flick into the lineup two weeks ahead of "Spider-Man." Starring pro
wrestler the Rock in a spinoff of "The Mummy" franchise, "The
Scorpion King" premiered with $36.1 million last weekend, a record
for a film opening in April. The movie has taken in $60.8 million in
its first 10 days.</LD>
<TE>   "We gave ourselves two full weeks with a lot of visibility and no
real competition out there," said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution
for Universal. "It turns out to have been a very successful
strategy."</TE>
<TE>   The thriller "Changing Lanes" held the No. 2 spot for the second
consecutive weekend with $9 million, pushing its 17-day total to
$44.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's main new films had weak premieres.</TE>
<TE>   The romantic comedy "Life or Something Like It," starring Angelina
Jolie as a shallow TV journalist coping with a street soothsayer's
prediction that she's about to die, opened in third place with $6.65
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason X," a sci-fi update of the "Friday the 13th" horror
franchise, premiered at No. 4 with $6.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in 2,606 theaters, "Life or Something Like It" averaged an
anemic $2,552 per cinema, compared with $5,103 in 3,449 theaters for
"The Scorpion King." "Jason X" averaged $3,461 in 1,878 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Box-office receipts for slasher films tend to tumble steeply after
opening weekend because the hard-core horror crowd already has come
and gone. "Life or Something Like It" might hold up better because
its largely female audience liked it and competition is scarce for
movies about women, said Rick Myerson, general sales manager for 20th
Century Fox, which distributed the film.</TE>
<TE>   In limited release, Val Kilmer's thriller "The Salton Sea" opened
strongly, grossing $175,000 at 15 theaters for a healthy $11,667
average. Kilmer plays a jazz trumpeter on Los Angeles' mean streets
seeking revenge for his wife's murder.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys," a film-festival hit about
the birth of extreme skateboarding in the 1970s, premiered in 20
theaters with $111,170 for a $5,559 average.</TE>
<TE>   The overall box office rose for the 11th consecutive weekend. The
top 12 movies grossed $69.8 million, up 27% from the same weekend
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic movie revenues are running 15% to 16% ahead of the pace
last year, when Hollywood had a record annual total of $8.4 billion.</TE>

<HD>A Verdi Requiem With Thrills and Chills</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Though the Verdi centenary year has come and gone, the procession of
Verdi Requiems in Southern California continues, this time in Ventura
County.</LD>
<LD>   Conductor Boris Brott, the New West Symphony, a fine quartet of
vocal soloists and the combined forces of the Ventura Master Chorale
and the Los Robles Master Chorale put together a respectable
performance of the requiem at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza on
Saturday night. Better yet, they managed to create a few thrills and
chills with a piece that for all of its highly charged strokes of
apocalyptic theater does not necessarily come off automatically.</LD>
<LD>   It was not a performance for those who dote upon lingering tempos
and floating spiritual contemplation. Brott liked to keep things
moving, sometimes rushing passages, enforcing abrupt cutoffs and long
pauses, bringing the whole work in at just under 80 minutes--a fast
pace. The thunderous recurring outbreaks of the Dies Irae music
seemed underpowered and murky in texture from the perspective of the
right side of the orchestra seats. The choruses didn't coalesce
completely until the final Libera Me section, just in time to pull
off the tightly conducted fugue near the close.</LD>
<TE>   Still, listeners were able to get a decent idea of the emotional
impact of this work. And when Brott signaled the trumpets in the
balconies during the Tuba Mirum section, yes, the Day of Judgment was
upon us in full cry.</TE>
<TE>   The most consistently inspired moments came from the vocal
quartet, and in particular, the veteran basso, on loan from Los
Angeles Opera, Louis Lebherz. Lebherz was outstanding, his voice in
resonant, clearly etched form, rendering the Confutatis section of
the Dies Irae movement with spine-chilling eloquence. Tenor Steven
Harrison brought emotional fervor and steady legato phrasing to the
Ingemisco section. Soprano Sharon Azrieli soared sweetly or quaked
with fear and wrath on cue, blending quite well with mezzo-soprano
Wendy Hillhouse.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not quite appropriate to describe the appearance by the Razbar
Ensemble at the Wadsworth Theatre on Saturday night as a
"performance." Despite its entertaining aspects, the event is more
correctly identified as a devotional experience.</LD>
<LD>   The Razbar Ensemble, based in Germany since it was organized in
1997, consists of Kurdish members of the Ahl-e Haqq sect, a mystical
Sufi order founded in the 15th century. The makeup of the Razbar
Ensemble reflects the Ahl-e Haqq willingness--rare in such orders--to
permit men and women to take part together in devotional
celebrations.</LD>
<LD>   Their presentation consisted of two segments. The first was a
djamm, or gathering, focused around the chanting and ecstatic
expression of zekr--spiritual hymns and poetry.</LD>
<TE>   The second was a Tchuppi dance in which a line of colorfully
garbed female dancers, moving through the hopping and skipping steps
characteristic of the genre, combined with a group of males to
simulate a wedding party.</TE>
<TE>   It was the opening segment, however, that created the most impact.
The 20-plus members of the ensemble, dressed in white and seated on
the floor of the stage, were accompanied by players of the tanbur, a
long-necked, lute-like instrument; the kamancheh, or spiked fiddle;
and the daf, or frame drum. The music was trance-like, intended to
build spiritual ecstasy rather than display instrumental virtuosity.</TE>
<TE>   As the intensity of the music, rhythms and chanting built,
individual members entered their own realms of spirituality, bodies
moving, arms waving, heads turning. In the audience, the aisles
filled with people responding in similarly fervent fashion--a
remarkable display of the Razbar Ensemble's capacity to generate
transcendent powers of communal expression.</TE>

<HD>Introducing New Host, Minimizing Kids' Blues</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Goodbye, Steve. Hello, Joe.</LD>
<LD>   "Blue's Clues," the "think-along" educational show for
preschoolers and the pride of Nickelodeon's "Nick Jr." lineup, is
about to get a new host. To prepare young viewers, who might
understandably feel some concern if original host Steven Burns were
simply to disappear, the network is tenderly cushioning the big
change in three transitional episodes that air at 7 tonight as a
90-minute "Meet Joe" special.</LD>
<LD>   Make no mistake: It's a big change. With its premiere in 1996,
"Blue's Clues" won the hearts of critics and viewers alike, thanks to
the vision of its creators--designer Traci Paige Johnson (who gave
the show its innovative, 3-D cutout-art look), head writer Angela C.
Santomoro and then-executive producer Todd Kessler--a vision that
included the casting of a young actor named Steven Burns as host.</LD>
<TE>   Burns' remarkable sincerity in talking to viewers one on one,
"listening" to them and comfortably providing those all-important
"thinking time" silences, has been key to "Blue's" success.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge is greater than you might think. The host must work
extensively with blue screen, not props, puppets or other actors.
When I interviewed Burns in 1998, he said that "it looks like I'm at
the bottom of a swimming pool, talking to individual microns of air."</TE>
<TE>   So it's not surprising that after six years, despite his status as
a preschool entertainment icon, Burns has decided to move on. Taking
his place is Donovan Patton, a novice to TV but an experienced stage
actor and puppeteer. He's younger and a head taller than Burns, and
wears a variation of the green, striped "Steve" shirt.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's carefully crafted episodes, Steve invites viewers to
share his eager anticipation of a visit from his brother Joe. When
Joe arrives, viewers are asked to help teach him the "Blue's Clues"
ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout, Steve helps viewers get comfortable with Joe by
drawing him in to the center of the action, until by the third
episode, Joe is getting solo screen time while Steve prepares to go
away to college, packing his suitcase and "skiddooing" into a
cartoony college catalog to show viewers what he'll be studying
there. The goodbyes aren't rushed, and he assures everyone that he'll
keep in touch.</TE>
<TE>   Patton needs to cut back on those open-mouthed, wide-eyed
expressions of wonder, but he's close to getting Burns' quiet rhythms
down, and his lively, puppyish curiosity is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in a touching passing of the torch, Steve packs away the
"handy dandy notebook" that he used to record the dog Blue's
paw-print clues, and Blue presents Joe with his own notebook--and
gives Steve a phone for calling home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The "Meet Joe" episodes of "Blue's Clues" can be seen at 7 tonight
on Nickelodeon. They repeat on Nickelodeon at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday and
on CBS at 7 a.m. Saturday.</TE>

<LD>There's wood to be chopped, chores to be done, cows to be milked,
petticoats to be scrubbed and grudges to be held on "Frontier House."</LD>
<LD>   It's 1883, and three urban families from the 21st century--that's
right, this century--are trying to make it as homesteaders in the
rugged Montana Territory.</LD>
<LD>   Fat chance? We'll see.</LD>
<TE>   From Malibu come the Clunes: business owner Gordon, 41; his wife,
Adrienne, 40; daughter Aine, 15; sons Justin, 13, and Conor, 9; and
niece Tracy, 15.</TE>
<TE>   From Tennessee come the Glenns: community college teacher Mark,
45; Karen, a 36-year-old school nurse; daughter Erinn, 13, and son,
Logan, 9.</TE>
<TE>   From Massachusetts come the Brooks: 28-year-old Nate, a student,
and his father, Rudy, 68, who will be replaced by Nate's 28-year-old
fiancee, Kristen, a social worker, set to arrive for the wedding and
move in with her new husband.</TE>
<TE>   No cell phones for these time travelers. No electricity and, by
pre-agreement, no comforts from home during their scheduled five
months in the Old West. No indoor facilities, not one roll of toilet
paper. No junk food, not one potato chip. No modern toys, not one
Nintendo game. No modern dress, not one pair of jeans or sneakers.</TE>
<TE>   These families signed up to wear period clothes, live in drafty
log cabins and exist off the land, their animals and their wits,
while hoping to survive in this exquisite wilderness that soon will
turn snowy white.</TE>
<TE>   They rise early and tumble into bed at night exhausted, hungry,
cold and homesick.</TE>
<TE>   Are they out of their minds or merely out of their element?</TE>
<TE>   It's not really 1883, of course. Unlike the pioneers they're
imitating, "settlers" here are ringed by TV gear and crews, and they
won't be dying on the prairie. Although nearly on their own, they get
a bit of help. Wranglers and carpenters initially pitch in. Plus they
get a small stake they can spend, along with limited credit at a
general store, a milk cow, a calf, a dog, and permission to buy or
trade for other animals and items available in Montana in 1883. And
if things get really bad for this trio of families picked from 5,000
applicants, well, look, this is no prison camp. Any one of them can
pack it in and go home.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't make these six hours of "Frontier House" any less
seductive, however. Just try not watching, from close-ups of these
neo-adventurers awkwardly straddling Americas of different ages to
panoramic views of them as specks against the rolling green majesty
of their environment.</TE>
<TE>   And angst? There's a wagon crisis, a gun crisis, a hunting crisis.
There's a range crisis right out of an MGM western, as our
homesteaders scramble to erect fences to keep out cattle about to be
driven across their property.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a cheating crisis when one of the families (all
right, it's the Clunes) brazenly compromises the historical integrity
of the series by breaking rules it agreed to follow as a condition
for taking part. And yes, there's even a makeup crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In this prime-time era of "Survivor"-mania, it's tempting to stamp
"clone" on shows that are even vaguely similar to that glossy
prototype. Not so, however, with this new PBS three-parter, which
begins tonight and continues through Wednesday, whose roots are much
less in hokey tribal councils and tailored-for-TV misery than in "The
1900 House," an earlier PBS series that monitored a contemporary
family of Brits living as Victorians.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the same producers, Simon Shaw and Beth Hoppe, are behind
"Frontier House," along with Nicolas Roether Brown and Maro
Chermayeff. Like the earlier program, this heroically smart new one
is as educational as magnetic, using narration to impart western
history as it documents the conflicts and dramatic twists that come
with relocating to this beautiful but challenging new habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the big-bucks competition on greedy, cutthroat "Survivor"
and its copies, the only payoff here is the experience. You know,
just doing it.</TE>
<TE>   For better or for worse.</TE>
<TE>   You'd expect communal closeness to help these people through hard
times. And this tiny settlement does come together occasionally as a
unit. Nate, who is black, and Kristen, who is white, have themselves
a hoot of a wedding, for instance, as a factoid is delivered to
viewers about interracial couples moving west to escape prejudice in
the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Yet wide cracks swiftly appear in the group's good-neighbor
facade, as "Frontier House" becomes as much about behavior under
stress in 2001 (when this was taped) as about pioneers fighting the
elements in 1883.</TE>
<TE>   Disputes and personality clashes are far more intense here than in
"The 1900 House" because of the dynamic of having three families take
part instead of one. Although not quite the feuding Hatfields and
McCoys, the earthy Glenns and affluent Clunes--whose mansion above
the Pacific was under construction as they roughed it in
Montana--repeatedly clash.</TE>
<TE>   At least, that's how it appears from footage shaped by skillful
editing into a narrative designed to tell a captivating story. In
pursuing the conflict necessary for good drama, however, the
producers do appear to be injecting themselves into "Frontier House"
by appearing to play one family against another.</TE>
<TE>   When Adrienne, a talented cook and baker, tearfully complains to
the camera about the sameness of her family's diet, for example, it
doesn't end there. The show cuts immediately to Karen in her own
cabin. Somehow aware of what was said, she addresses the camera in a
huff as if it were Adrienne: "My animals are well fed, my children
are well fed. And honey, if you didn't understand [the challenges]
when you applied for this, then you are on some little glitz trip."</TE>
<TE>   You sense here class and regional antagonisms too bitter to remain
suppressed. Karen later calls the Clunes "West Coast cutie-pies," as
the combat grows worse.</TE>
<TE>   Quite amazingly, meanwhile, the marriage of Karen and Mark begins
fraying right before our eyes. "I'm ready to kick him out and do this
by myself," Karen tells the camera at one point. "I think my wife is
turning into some kind of Hitler," says Ken separately. Their
fighting, too, grows worse.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the camera's altering presence, TV doesn't get more candid
than "Frontier House," whose most heart-wrenching sequences arrive
late in the series when Karen's son, Logan, is crushed when first a
hen and then a pig he personally tended and adored are designated for
slaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We're nice, we're southern," he pleads. "We let things live, and
now we're killing something. That is so stupid."</TE>
<TE>   "You raise animals all spring and summer to kill them in the fall,
and that's how it is," explains Karen, who is tender but firm. As
Logan sobs, the family's pig that it kept as a pet and named is shot
in the head and promptly hung on a hook and butchered.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Jo-Jo would be proud that she's making such a
contribution and we're enjoying her so much," says Ken later over a
plate of pig being served at a harvest fair. He's serious.</TE>
<TE>   On the day the Glenns are to leave Montana and return to
Tennessee, Karen serves quiche as a going away meal. "Eggs from a
chicken, bacon from Jo-Jo," she says. The family, including Logan,
eats heartily.</TE>

<HD>News Divisions Reluctant to Drop Anchors</HD>
<DH>TV* Network execs worry that replacing old, familiar faces
with new ones could roil the ratings waters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Brian Williams has what you might call a Prince Charles problem. What
happens to a guy who trains his whole life for a job that just never
seems to open up?</LD>
<LD>   There's an anchor logjam in television news, and a whole class of
TV journalists, including NBC's Williams, CBS' John Roberts and
others, has been prepped for one of those prestigious posts and led
to believe that one day it might be theirs, along with the
commensurate riches and fame.</LD>
<LD>   But the men and women at the top don't appear to be going anywhere
anytime soon. CBS' Dan Rather has hit 70 and is still going strong.
Peter Jennings is widely expected to renew his expiring ABC contract,
assuming the two sides can work out suitable pay at a time when many
ABC on-air people have been asked to take salary cuts up to 25%.</LD>
<TE>   Katie Couric made noises about leaving NBC's "Today," then signed
a new deal that allows her to stay on for nearly five years if she
wants. Stone Phillips and Jane Pauley were feted last week in New
York for their 10 years anchoring NBC's "Dateline."</TE>
<TE>   ABC even turned to two existing prime-time anchors, Diane Sawyer
and Charlie Gibson, when it needed a quick fix for "Good Morning
America," but their temporary double-duty posts have now stretched
into three years.</TE>
<TE>   That has left many people vying for the few open positions,
including the slot being vacated by Bryant Gumbel at CBS' "The Early
Show," whose last day is expected to be May 17, according to CBS News
executives. And that job may not even go to a network news person,
but to game-show host Tom Bergeron, who is scheduled to substitute
this week as well as the week after Gumbel leaves, according to
executives there.</TE>
<TE>   The low turnover is due to reluctance by network
executives--worriedly eyeing declining viewer interest in network
news over the last decade as cable has blossomed--to start over with
anchors who aren't household names. ABC gambled unsuccessfully on
lesser-known morning anchors Lisa McRee and Kevin Newman before
turning to Sawyer and Gibson; any change in that time slot will again
mean a period of rebuilding, just as the program is gaining traction.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers tune in for established anchors, says talent agent Ken
Lindner, and losing them would invite viewers to surf. "It's
daunting, because you run the risk of losing part of your core
viewership," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom, Peter and Dan are called the Big Three for a reason," says
Williams of the three evening news anchors, one of whom he may
someday replace. "In this business, you don't earn your salary 364
days a year; you earn it one day a year, when America, 'the nation
turns its lonely eyes to you,'" he says, quoting Simon and Garfunkel.
"These guys are terrifically good at what they do, and the jobs are
too important for them to be handed out on a whim. It's important for
them to stay in them as long as they can."</TE>
<TE>   But if this strategy of stability has emerged for competitive
reasons, it has also benefited a broadcast competitor: cable news.
Tired of waiting for an anchor post at ABC, Aaron Brown jumped to
CNN, where he has a nightly program. Connie Chung, likewise, found
herself being paid an anchor's salary without an anchor job at ABC,
where Sawyer and Barbara Walters of "20/20" are firmly ensconced.
She, too, is now at CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest Sawyer went to MSNBC after a stint as a well-regarded ABC
substitute anchor, and Fox News Channel hired Brit Hume from ABC
News.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that now, if you want to be an anchor, you work for local
stations or for cable," says Marcy McGinnis, senior vice president of
news coverage at CBS News. In cable, she says, "the good news is
there are a lot more anchor jobs, and the bad news is, nobody's
watching."</TE>
<TE>   The three network evening newscasts combined draw an average of 30
million viewers. By contrast, the top-rated cable hour in prime time,
"The O'Reilly Factor," averaged an estimated 2.1 million during the
first quarter, according to Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the migration of talent with network experience has brought
more visibility to cable and been made possible as cable networks,
locked in their own competitive battle, have increased the amount
they are willing to pay. Chung is thought to be making just over $2
million annually at CNN, a far cry from CNN's early days when the
channel was notoriously cheap.</TE>
<TE>   Larry King, CNN's most-watched personality, makes close to $7
million a year, and Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly, who has cable
news' highest-rated show, takes home an estimated $4 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, most cable salaries aren't in the $5 million-to-$10 million
bracket that a top network anchor commands. Couric, whose "Today" is
the most profitable network news program, pulls in more than $15
million a year. With a few exceptions, those network salaries are
dropping, however, as networks try to rein in costs.</TE>
<TE>   The Holy Grail of anchor posts is still considered a network
evening newscast, whose anchors have been in place roughly two
decades each. NBC's Tom Brokaw gave hope to aspiring anchors in
recent years when he started musing about retiring at the end of this
summer, but he is still on the fence, at least publicly.</TE>
<TE>   If he stays, that would be a blow to Williams, who has been
groomed for the job and currently occupies prime real estate at
sister channel MSNBC, where he anchors an hourlong nightly newscast
in addition to being Brokaw's designated sub. Some NBC executives
worry that should Brokaw stay, NBC will lose Williams, who also has
CBS News interested, although Rather shows no sign of cutting back.
Williams declined to comment on his personal situation.</TE>
<TE>   Whether someone lands an anchor slot is "a lot about timing and
luck, when things come open," says Amy Entelis, senior vice president
of talent recruitment and business affairs for ABC News. Chung and
Brown, she says, "maybe didn't want to wait and saw a better
opportunity and grabbed it."</TE>
<TE>   But, she says, it can also "be a bad thing to get the label 'heir
apparent.' People in our business sit with bated breath and say,
'When, when, when,' and that can be undermining." Those who do well,
she says, are those who continue to report at the same time as they
anchor. "The direction of the business is you have to have
flexibility, to not be one thing."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, ABC has had its best year in some time for promoting new
anchors, Entelis says, and those have been strong correspondents,
including Robin Roberts, just named the news reader at "Good Morning
America." Some of the opportunity, she says, was created by the
year's news, "a series of stories bigger than we ever imagined, which
showed people in new light." That included John Miller, who, having
done several well-regarded reports on terrorism, was named Barbara
Walters' "20/20" co-anchor.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't get to replace a '20/20' anchor but every 10 or 15
years, but the timing was right," Entelis says.</TE>
<TE>   An anchor position at Sunday's "This Week" is also expected to
open up, with Cokie Roberts stepping down. ABC is discussing whether
to give Sam Donaldson another assignment and put George
Stephanopoulos in the job.</TE>
<TE>   Rather's job and the morning position aside, CBS has chosen to go
largely anchor-less, preferring to be known for a strong group of
correspondents.</TE>
<TE>   "There's less frustration here," as a result, says McGinnis.
"Everyone's not clamoring for Dan's chair; they're clamoring to be on
'60 Minutes' and '60 Minutes II' and there's a realistic expectation
to get there."</TE>

<LD>War rages. Terrorists conspire. Repression and abuse proliferate.
Economies shiver. The world is coming apart at the seams.</LD>
<LD>   Today the chaotic tumult of the 1960s seems less remote than it
has for some time. Internationally, our current social and political
landscape offers enough recognizable scenery to form an essential
context for the art in "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-1972,"
which opened Sunday at the Geffen Contemporary, the Museum of
Contemporary Art's warehouse facility in Little Tokyo. This is an
exceptionally good show--provocative, poetic, comprehensive and
unexpectedly timely. It focuses on 14 Italian artists working mostly
in Milan, Turin and Rome during an especially charged period.</LD>
<LD>   The show has been trimmed somewhat from its debut last year at
Minneapolis' Walker Art Center, which organized "Zero to Infinity."
The MOCA presentation was postponed (it was originally scheduled to
open in March).</LD>
<TE>   Trimmed or not, be grateful that it has arrived. MOCA's exhibition
is laid out as 14 solo shows, with an introductory gallery that
samples work by each artist. The salutary effect is to demonstrate
both similarities and individual differences among these important
artists, who never really worked as a single, coherent group. Arte
povera arrived in sequential waves with an expanding number of
artists throughout the decade.</TE>
<TE>   The name Arte povera says a lot. (It's pronounced "AR-tay
po-VAIR-uh.") Most cleanly translated as "poor art," it suggests
humility. For sculpture the durable elegance of bronze was out, the
dull inertia of lead was in. Domestic crafts such as knitting and
embroidery turn up far more often than the courtly medium of oil
paint and canvas.</TE>
<TE>   Marketable artistic commodities, such as traditional paintings and
sculptures, got replaced by ephemeral propositions, including
disposable art made from cardboard and consumable foodstuffs. The
shift was partly an effect of the postwar economic boom known as "the
Italian miracle," skittering to a halt in 1964. But stripping down to
non-art basics provides the "zero" of "Zero to Infinity."</TE>
<TE>   The term Arte povera isn't just a reference to modest means and
humble materials, though. It also implies a more fundamental sense of
the impoverishment of art as it was then known. What good was a
painting when the world was in collapse? Why bother with figures
carved from stone when social chaos reigned? Changing the way people
were used to thinking was one mandate of this art.</TE>
<TE>   Even the latest radical forms of American avant-garde art circa
1962 seem to have felt extravagant to these artists. The four sleek,
low-slung iron troughs in an untitled sculpture by Jannis Kounellis,
a Greek expatriate working in Rome, pointedly echo the then-new
Minimalist abstraction of sculptors like Donald Judd. But Kounellis
filled his industrial troughs with rich loam, then planted them with
a tenaciously elegant, ecologically spare cactus garden. A high-toned
Minimalist sculpture is cheekily transformed into a workmanlike
planter.</TE>
<TE>   It's important to note that Arte povera was one symptom of the
era's larger international youth movement. All the artists included
in "Zero to Infinity" were under 30 in 1962, with the exception of
Mario Merz (born 1925) and his wife, Marisa (born 1931 and the only
woman among the loosely configured group). The generation was mostly
born during World War II and--artistically--their youthfulness
collided head-on with Italy's ancient past.</TE>
<TE>   Luciano Fabro's six colossal sculptures of feet are emblematic.
Like fragments of monumental statues that are all that remains from
the antique reign of some obscure Roman emperor, they are carved from
sleek marble and deep maroon porphyry, or cast in glass with the
density of rock crystal or in eternal bronze. The huge, claw-like
feet imply mythological origins. Their legs rise up to the ceiling,
towering overhead but cloaked in dainty silk bloomers. A buffoonish
aura of Victorian modesty descends on these bird-like feet, which
suggest a gigantic serving of roast pheasant from some pretentious
bourgeois chef.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, Fabro's paper and glass maps of the boot of Italy wrapped
in lead give blunt form to the weight of history. Another map,
fashioned from gilded bronze, is strung up by its heel and suspended
from a chain overhead, like Mussolini lynched by the mob.</TE>
<TE>   The most beautiful map is by Alighiero Boetti (1940-1994). On a
commercially printed political map of the world, Boetti filled in
each country with the painted emblem of its modern national flag.
This served as the design template for a fabric wall hanging, which
he had embroidered by traditional Afghan and Pakistani weavers. As
political demarcations were made into aesthetic decisions, Boetti
transformed the isolating partitions of national boundaries into
colorful, luxurious visual abstractions.</TE>
<TE>   Italian Renaissance painting turns up in a sly conundrum by Giulio
Paolini. This simple work consists of a life-size black-and-white
photograph of an elegant, face-front portrait painting. Its title,
"Young Man Looking at Lorenzo Lotto," describes what the long-dead
portrait subject did when the 16th century Venetian artist painted
the picture reproduced in the photograph. Now, a photograph takes the
place of the painting, and we assume the position once held by the
artist. The photograph "looks" at us.</TE>
<TE>   Paolini's deft work shows how mass reproduction regards the
audience as its object. Ounce for ounce, this lucid, unassuming
facsimile may be the most eloquent work in the exhibition.</TE>
<TE>   For Italians, the experience of a world coming apart at the seams
is hardly new. (Pick a century; any century.) Unsurprisingly, ritual
repetition turns up as a leitmotif in Arte povera, especially in the
Merzes' very different sculptures.</TE>
<TE>   When Mario Merz rendered a medieval numerical system in neon
tubing, a natural pattern of spiral growth got advertised--just the
way beer or cigarettes might be on a supermarket storefront. When
Marisa Merz knitted the letters of her daughter's name from nylon
thread, she used the material of space-age plastic to repeat an
ancient domestic task. (Think of Homer's famous epic of family and
fate, "The Odyssey," with Penelope repeatedly knitting and then
unraveling her handiwork as she waits for Odysseus to return.) Ritual
repetition offers the infinity that follows zero.</TE>
<TE>   There is some weak work in the exhibition. The cannon, submachine
gun and jungle bridge made from steel wool and scrap metal by Pino
Pascali (1935-1968), who is little known today, is pretty corny.
Emilio Prini's printed paper declaring, "He confirms his
participation in the exhibition" is as thin and tedious as Conceptual
art gets. Michelangelo Pistoletto's sculptures that frame the
physical activity of looking at art have long been popular, although
they've always struck me as gimmicky. But works like these are in the
minority.</TE>
<TE>   In 1967 the Italian critic and curator Germano Celant, who
vigorously promoted the artists and coined the term by which they
came to be identified, published an essay called "Arte Povera: Notes
on a Guerrilla War." The idea that art could perform a kind of
underground combat might now seem unsound, not least because art has
moved from the margins to center stage.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the notion also recalls the faith of Italian political
philosopher Antonio Gramsci, imprisoned during the rise of European
fascism in the 1930s, who argued that social change could best be
fostered by capturing the culture. That proposition might be
arguable, but as "Zero to Infinity" makes more than plain, the art
produced in its spirit can be thrillingly ambitious.</TE>

<HD>'Chicanos' Moves in Two Directions</HD>
<DH>Activism and celebration are at odds in choreographer Gema
Sandoval's cultural epic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The conflict between what company director and choreographer Gema
Sandoval's program note called "my traditional self" and "my activist
self" made her ambitious, full-evening epic "Chicanos: The Spirit of
Aztlan" a fascinating failure in its premiere Saturday at the Japan
America Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   Divided into eight sections, with half the choreography newly
created and half recycled from Danza Floricanto/USA repertory, this
exploration of Mexican American cultural identity showcased
Sandoval's activism in a remarkably single-minded view of the Spanish
conquest. No tribute to Christianization here. Instead, we saw people
terrorized and subjugated in front of a church window, with the cross
less the key symbol than a conquistador with a whip.</LD>
<LD>   Such images led to an attempt to summarize cultural colonialism
through three duets showing the interaction of Spanish men and native
women, perhaps the most artful of Sandoval's new choreography.</LD>
<TE>   But as soon as she reached 1848, when, in the words of her program
note and narration, "Los Californios from the north became part of
the United States," Sandoval's "traditional self" took over, and the
performance became one long party. Energetic celebrations of the work
ethic, authoritative tributes to Chicano roots in different regions
of mother Mexico and uneven versions of the pop dances that Latinos
found once they got to U.S. cities dominated much of Act 2.</TE>
<TE>   A few glints of activism remained, but they seemed surprisingly
sugarcoated. "In 1848, the first wetbacks were born," Sandoval
informed us, but her depiction of their journey to California became
a kind of game: border agents dancing traditional percussive steps in
place while spirited, colorfully costumed dancers deftly eluded them.
Breaking a pinata couldn't have been more playful.</TE>
<TE>   In her somber "Las Tres Fridas" section, Sandoval depicted the
responsibility of the artist to learn from the past, and you could
argue that she evaded that responsibility by not taking more
seriously the dangers of coming to this country as a mojado and
working as a bracero. A celebration of survival such as Alvin Ailey's
solo "Cry" reminds you how hard-won that survival can be, but the
entertainer in Sandoval made it look far too easy.</TE>
<TE>   What seemed difficult--indeed, something of a struggle--was the
dancing. Performances of folklore from Nayarit, Huasteca, Veracruz
and Jalisco found the spirited Danza Floricanto soloists and ensemble
on familiar turf, but they often looked stiff and tentative in such
unfamiliar show-dance challenges as the strut and slink in the "Low
Rider" and "Pachuco" sections.</TE>
<TE>   Gema M. Sandoval (the choreographer's daughter) always delivered
the purest statement of a scene's style and mood, while Sergio Mora,
masked as the god Quetzalcoatl, managed to execute one-legged spins
and complex footwork in perfect unison with the women's ensemble.</TE>
<TE>   Although lighting designer Monique L'Heureux enforced considerable
variety, "Chicanos" needed a supportive production design--extensive
documentary projections, perhaps, that would have made the dancers
seem embedded in Mexican and Mexican American history rather than
appear as a small, isolated symbol of something much greater than
they could possibly represent unaided.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" was a key book for the Beat movement,
which was started half a century ago by a small group of writers and
artists who used their unfettered creativity to challenge the
literary and cultural status quo. So it makes perfect marketing sense
that the bicoastal celebration "Beatfest 2002" would be co-sponsored
by a car company, along with a giant bookstore chain and corporate
nightclub the Knitting Factory, which launched the event's eight-day
Los Angeles run on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Such Beat icons as Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs
certainly had an appreciation for ironic juxtapositions, so maybe
they would have been amused by how performers in the main room were
framed by a trio of logos on stage, as if appearing on a Fox TV
channel.</LD>
<LD>   Although the artists weren't always directly connected to the
Beats, most paid their respects somehow, with headlining
singer-songwriter Vic Chesnutt telling a particularly memorable tale
of once meeting Ginsberg, who reproached the paraplegic musician for
crashing his car while drunk.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Chesnutt's hourlong solo set only occasionally
featured such striking moments, like the wistful image of dancing
with Isadora Duncan in a cafe. The guitarist's squeaky voice and the
languid, bare-bones presentation proved less interesting than the
songs' underlying sense of melancholy and wit.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriter Michael Penn offered no commentary on the Beats,
but provided a more compelling batch of tunes about human foibles and
romantic fragility.</TE>
<TE>   Following sets by spoken-word artists Iris Lord and Jerry Quickly,
composer and multi-instrumentalist David Amram best reflected the
Beat spirit. An early associate of Kerouac et al, Amram, 71, offered
a freewheeling half-hour of music and talk. When he encouraged
listeners to act on their own impulses and perfect their art for
art's sake, he neatly underscored that despite whatever establishment
logo gets slapped on it, the true Beat Generation lives on.</TE>

<HD>A Festival for Fans and Musicians to Mingle</HD>
<DH>The second Fan Nation gives the audience face time with
Sheryl Crow, Goo Goo Dolls, Ryan Adams and others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Corporate sponsorship and product placement being what they are in
the rock world these days, the natural assumption Saturday at the
second Fan Nation festival at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Irvine
would have been that the lead tour sponsor was Levi's.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, the event--featuring performances and such close-contact
elements as autograph and question-and-answer sessions--is put on by
radio station Star 98.7 FM and the fan-friendly Web site
Artistdirect.com. But practically everyone on stage was outfitted in
faded jeans and T-shirts, and except for headliner Sheryl Crow, all
the singing was handled by scruffy guys with guitars.</LD>
<LD>   That added up to a show that was the antithesis of the slickly
produced, elaborately fashioned and choreographed music that
represents such a major slice of the pop pie nowadays.</LD>
<TE>   The fact that all the bands (Goo Goo Dolls, Five for Fighting,
Rubyhorse) and individual performers (Crow, Ryan Adams, John Mayer)
are rooted in the singer-songwriter tradition further put the focus
squarely on music, bypassing any production effects save for a bit of
stage fog and one big blast from a pair of confetti cannons.</TE>
<TE>   The mood during the six hours of music was celebratory but still
muted, the crowd offering up its strongest responses to such
heart-on-sleeve material as the Goo Goo Dolls' "Iris," Five for
Fighting's breakthrough hit "Superman (It's Not Easy)" and its
version of the Beatles' "Let It Be," most of Mayer's whispered-sung
songs and the title track from Crow's new "C'mon, C'mon" album.</TE>
<TE>   The format allowed an egalitarian 45 minutes per act, which seemed
to benefit the emerging artists most by giving new listeners enough
time to get to know them. That gave a giant career shot to Rubyhorse,
a little-known Irish quintet added to the lineup Friday after singer
Jewel canceled due to a horseback-riding accident. Its music combined
elements of U2's grand-scale rock with Creed's arms-wide-open
emotionalism.</TE>
<TE>   The value of the interactive portion of the day swung widely
depending on whether fans got what they were after.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really, really upset," said Christine Kearns, 26, of Costa
Mesa, one of dozens turned away when Crow's autograph-signing session
ended.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a big, big reason I came to this, and now the rest of
the day is ruined. I don't think I'll come back."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, 28-year-old Rebecca Coriaty of Long Beach said,
"Last year was great, and this year is great," as she emerged with
Crow's autograph from one of two tents where performers signed CD
covers, posters and even fans' bodies for 45 minutes at a time. "It
works," she added, noting she'd waited in line for two hours, "but it
can be difficult."</TE>

<LD>When "Spider-Man" credits roll on Friday, a name will appear
alongside Stan Lee's that may elicit wild cheering from a few
audience members and muted confusion from everyone else. The name is
Steve Ditko. And the people applauding are comic-book fans thrilled
that Ditko, the original artist and co-creator of Spider-Man, has
been given proper credit--at long last--on the occasion of Spidey's
big-screen debut.</LD>
<LD>   Ditko won't be anywhere in the vicinity of the movie's hype
machine, though. While Lee, Spider-Man's other, better known
co-creator, is pumping the film at media events and premiere parties,
Ditko will probably be at his cramped studio in midtown Manhattan,
hunched over a drawing board working on more comics.</LD>
<LD>   Then again, it's hard to know exactly what Ditko will be doing.
The first rule of Steve Ditko is you don't talk about Steve Ditko.
Not to the press, not even to friends or peers. Intensely private,
Ditko is an enigmatic figure--the J.D. Salinger of comics. He avoids
publicity and hasn't given an interview in more than 35 years. Only a
few published photographs of him are known to exist, and good luck
finding them.</LD>
<TE>   "He's the exact opposite of me," says Lee, who has spent the last
40 years as the public face of Spider-Man and the rest of Marvel
Comics' superhero pantheon.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know Ditko say he prefers to let his work speak for
itself. In a career spanning five decades, the 74-year-old artist has
produced hundreds of comic books in genres ranging from horror to
science fiction to erotica. But nothing in Ditko's oeuvre has matched
the popularity and success of his work on Spider-Man, which he and
Lee unleashed on the world in the early 1960s in "Amazing Fantasy"
No. 15 and the first 38 issues of "Amazing Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   With few exceptions, no comic-book series has been the source of
as much controversy among fans and historians. The debates include
such esoteric questions as who dreamed up Spider-Man's webbing or his
belt-mounted flashlight. Then there's the intriguing mystery of why
Ditko suddenly departed the title in 1966 and never drew a Spider-Man
story again.</TE>
<TE>   On their pioneering Spider-Man run, Lee and Ditko tweaked the
traditions of superhero-dom. Eschewing the tedious infallibility of
Superman, they saddled the webslinger with real-life dilemmas--money
troubles, a sick Aunt May--and somewhat bizarre superpowers. Lee
enlivened the action with snappy, humorous dialogue; Ditko's moody
and naturalistic line work brought Spider-Man down to earth,
emphasizing his humanity. In those formative years, the co-creators
established the mythology that has guided Spider-Man's development
ever since. The Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe in the movie, is
a Ditko-Lee creation.</TE>
<TE>   Ditko's ink prints are especially visible in the film. "You can
see a lot of Ditko's influence in the way Spidey moves on the big
screen--the classic poses and movements are all up there," says
"Spider-Man" producer Laura Ziskin.</TE>
<TE>   The film credit reads, "Based on the Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee
and Steve Ditko." That may not seem very significant, but to Ditko
fans it represents a long-awaited validation. In one of those
injustices for which the comics industry is famous, Ditko has not
received any royalties from the billion-dollar franchise based on
Spider-Man because he co-created the character on a work-for-hire
basis.</TE>
<TE>   More important to his fans, there has long been a public
misconception that Stan Lee was the sole creator of
Spider-Man--fostered by a combination of Lee's grandstanding, Ditko's
reclusiveness and Marvel's practice of not giving credit to the
original creators of its heroes. In the March issue of the
long-running "Amazing Spider-Man," Marvel listed Ditko's name on the
title page for the first time since 1966. Series editor Axel Alonso
says the credit was a "tip of the hat to Ditko" that may appear again
around the time of the movie, but not as a matter of company policy.</TE>
<TE>   Personal Details About Ditko Are Scarce</TE>
<TE>   The personal details that are known about Steve Ditko would fit on
one side of an index card. He was born Nov. 2, 1927, in Johnstown,
Pa., the son of Eastern European immigrants. As a child, he was a fan
of Batman and the Spirit. He has a brother named Patrick. In 1945, he
graduated from Greater Johnstown High School. Five years later, he
set off for New York and enrolled in the Cartoonists and Illustrators
School, where he studied under Golden Age Batman artist Jerry
Robinson. He is a lifelong bachelor, and he has no children.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Groth is editor in chief of the Comics Journal, an industry
publication noteworthy for its expansive, in-depth interviews. He has
known Ditko for more than 20 years and has been trying to land an
interview for at least as long. "I don't think we're going to get
one," Groth says.</TE>
<TE>   According to friends and former collaborators, Ditko's life has
been heavily influenced by Objectivism, the philosophy of rational
thought and individual free will sketched out in Ayn Rand's novels
"The Fountainhead" and "Atlas Shrugged." Ditko sees the world in
stark black and white, with no gray in between. As such, he does not
compromise on issues that contradict his artistic or ethical
sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Marv Wolfman, a comics writer and the creator of Blade, worked
with Ditko on the Marvel comic "Machine Man" in the late 1970s.
Wolfman remembers that Ditko was more than willing to discuss
Spider-Man and his supporting cast, but that the artist nixed any
attempts to incorporate the wallcrawler into the new series. "He
always felt that Spidey should never be older than 16, because that
was the last year a kid could totally screw up," Wolfman says.</TE>
<TE>   Affront to Artistic Principles Prompts Anger</TE>
<TE>   Subsequent efforts by Marvel editors and writers, including Lee,
to bring Ditko back to the Spider-Man fold were similarly rebuffed.
"He never wanted to do Spider-Man again," says Jack C. Harris, who
edited Ditko at DC Comics.</TE>
<TE>   Ditko's acquaintances describe him as polite, friendly and
soft-spoken. But Ditko also has a dark side, which emerges most
acutely when his principles are affronted. In one incident, he
stopped doing a series and furiously chastised the publisher because
of a slight color error on the cover of the first issue.</TE>
<TE>   Author Cat Yronwode, a former comics publisher, endured Ditko's
wrath when she tried to write a book about him in the mid-1980s. When
Ditko found out that Yronwode had interviewed his brother, he
exploded. "He felt that I had invaded his privacy."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Yronwode's manuscript for "The Art of Steve Ditko" and
all her notes were destroyed in a house flood. "That was the end of
it," she says. "I felt that for whatever reason, maybe it was God
speaking, I was not meant to do this."</TE>
<TE>   True to form, Ditko declined to be interviewed for this article,
as did his brother.</TE>
<TE>   Ditko's first published work, "Black Magic" No. 27, appeared in
1953. During the late '50s, he worked with Lee at Atlas, the
predecessor to Marvel Comics, on short horror and fantasy stories
with titles like "Zzutak: The Thing That Shouldn't Exist" and "Fear
in the Night." "He helped me out so many times when we had an
emergency and I needed an artist to do something quickly," Lee
recalls. "He was a joy and a pleasure to work with."</TE>
<TE>   Lee and Ditko's first Spider-Man story was actually an experiment.
In the early 1960s, Marvel had pulled out of a decade-long slump and
was flush with the success of its 1961 title "The Fantastic Four."
Editor Lee wanted to follow up with more heroes, beginning with a
nerdy high school student who gains the proportionate strength of a
spider in a freak lab accident. Lee's publisher, Martin Goodman,
hated the idea, particularly the insect theme and the fact that the
hero was a teenager. Lee compromised by slotting Spider-Man's
inaugural tale into the final issue of a canceled fantasy series.</TE>
<TE>   Spider-Man Co-Creators Begin to Disagree</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Lee assigned the art chores to legendary comics artist
Jack Kirby, with whom he had co-created the Fantastic Four. Kirby
returned with several pages of bombastic heroic renderings Lee didn't
think were quite right, so he turned to Ditko. "There was something
about the way he drew," Lee says. "It had a realistic style, it
wasn't too exaggerated or too over the top."</TE>
<TE>   "Amazing Fantasy" No. 15 hit newsstands in August 1962. When the
issue's staggering sales figures came back a few months later, Lee
gave the character his own series. "Amazing Spider-Man" debuted in
March 1963, and almost immediately became a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, though, the co-creators began to disagree on
the title's direction. After a few dozen issues, Ditko was plotting
the book himself and turning the penciled pages over to Lee, who
filled in the dialogue. "I didn't know what he'd be bringing me. It
was almost like doing a crossword puzzle," Lee says.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Roy Thomas joined the company as assistant editor in
1965, Ditko and Lee were no longer speaking to each other, using
intermediaries to communicate. "There wasn't a lot of anger, it was
just that they got to arguing so much over the plot lines," Thomas
recalls. Then, one day in early 1966, Ditko walked into Marvel's
offices on Madison Avenue, delivered a stack of pages, and quit. The
only person who knows for sure why Ditko left is Ditko.</TE>
<TE>   The lore repeated in comic book circles is that the final straw
was a dispute over the unmasking of the Green Goblin. Ditko wanted
him to turn out to be someone who hadn't been seen before; Lee argued
that he should be an established character so readers wouldn't feel
cheated.</TE>
<TE>   Lee says he remembers the disagreement over the Green Goblin but
doesn't think that's what prompted Ditko's resignation. "I really
don't know why he left to this day, and he's never told me," Lee
says.</TE>
<TE>   For many years, Ditko remained silent. Recently, however, he began
writing a series of essays in the Comics, a small-circulation
newsletter about the history of comic books. The reason he broke his
silence, Ditko writes, was due to a few public incidents, including a
1998 Time magazine article that credited Lee as the "creator" of
Spider-Man.</TE>
<TE>   Much of his writing is given over to odd Ayn Randian ramblings
like the following: "Too many people choose to be unjust takers in
their dealing, transactions with others. They want, demand, the
unearned and undeserved."</TE>
<TE>   But on the matter of why he gave up the series, he writes only, "I
know why I left Marvel but no one else in this universe knew or knows
why. It may be of a mild interest to realize that Stan Lee chose not
to know, to hear why, I left." Lee is aware of Ditko's resentment. A
few years ago, Lee tried to set the record straight by sending Ditko
a letter in which he said, "I have always considered Steve Ditko to
be Spider-Man's co-creator." Ditko's response appeared in the May
2001 issue of the Comics: "'Considered' means to ponder, look at
closely, examine, etc. and does not admit, or claim, or state that
Steve Ditko is Spider-Man's co-creator."</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, I don't know what to say," Lee says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want this to turn into a feud, because I love the guy.
But I don't know what to do to make him happy."</TE>

<HD>Strong Ensembles Step Up the Pace of 'Encounters'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her two-act dance-play "Encounters," Kelly Devine creates some of
the best group choreography on local stages, a distinctively personal
take on commercial pop dance style.</LD>
<LD>   At the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood on Friday, Devine's
ability to infuse hot ensembles with unexpected originality--adding a
feline stretch here, a sweet buoyancy there--even carried
"Encounters" through a formula finale in which members of her
14-dancer company took turns performing their favorite steps.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Devine proved clueless when it came to using
movement to coherently portray character or express emotion. In
intimate dramatic scenes--the crux of the "Encounters" plot--she
simply threw flashy steps at her leads like raw meat to lions. Nor
was she strong enough as a writer and director to keep Jenna Stewart,
Stacy Walker and Jason Yribar from turning a mundane love triangle
into an overwrought, wordless soap opera.</LD>
<TE>   In outline, her story resembled one of those dreadful Lifetime
cable movies in which the dream stud of the first reel always turns
into Mr. Monster by the fade-out.</TE>
<TE>   As mentioned, the ensembles looked terrific and, at the beginning
of Act 2, Devine briefly explored the three main characters' feelings
with a welcome simplicity. But soon after, "Encounters" ricocheted
into teary melodrama and crude comic relief, undermining any shred of
credibility.</TE>
<TE>   As the victimized single, Stewart needed greater vulnerability and
Walker more than a slew of gestural mannerisms as the betrayed wife.
But Yribar commanded enough authority as a dancing actor to make each
scene and solo impressive on its own terms.</TE>
<TE>   Danced to uncredited pop recordings, "Encounters" featured scenic
panels by David Weiss that suggested various locations but left
plenty of room for dancing.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gilda Radner won America's heart first as a ragamuffin comedian, then
as a warrior against cancer. Her life story should make for a
wonderfully inspirational TV movie, yet the version of it told
tonight in "Gilda Radner: It's Always Something" (9 p.m., ABC) is
surprisingly uninvolving.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the problem is that so many of the participants in
Radner's story are well-known television and film personalities, from
her colleagues in the original cast of "Saturday Night Live" to her
second husband, Gene Wilder. This means that the actors portraying
them have the doubly difficult task of perfecting impersonations,
then layering on the emotions.</LD>
<LD>   Jami Gertz as Radner and Tom Rooney as Wilder do a fair job of the
impersonations, but the emotion too rarely filters through. This
remoteness is still more pronounced among the supporting players.
It's like spending the entire movie among those roaming fake
celebrities at the Universal Studios theme park.</LD>
<TE>   As written by Janet Brownell and directed by Duane Clark, the
story also suffers from what you might call a checklist approach.
Beloved father dies of cancer? Check. Radner earns early acclaim at
Toronto's Second City comedy club? Check. Radner becomes part of a
cultural phenomenon on "SNL"? Check.</TE>
<TE>   And so on.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of fantasy moments help to perk things up. Every face in
an audience applauding one of Radner's "SNL" skits becomes her
father's. During the grueling days of chemotherapy for ovarian
cancer, she dreams of being interviewed by her Baba Wawa character.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of this packs the wallop of seeing the real Radner in
a vintage clip at the film's end. For more of this, tune in at 8 p.m.
for the clip compilation "Gilda Radner's Greatest Moments."</TE>

<HD>A Few Real-Life Shows to Rival 'Bachelor'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE YOUNG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's over. Thank, God! He's made his selection, and we men no longer
have to sit in front of the TV, alternating between salivating over
this bachelor's unbelievable luck and wanting to slap him across the
face for how lousy our own miserable dating lives now seem in
comparison (except when I met my lovely wife, right dear?).</LD>
<LD>   If you are one of the handful who are somehow unaware of ABC's
unscripted series "The Bachelor" (which aired its final episode last
Thursday), let me explain what you missed--and, speaking for the
guys, will never, ever be privy to.</LD>
<LD>   For one hour each week, a large part of America watched this guy,
31-year-old Alex, be courted by 25 women, each attempting to induce
him to banish the other 24, leaving just her to marry. Did I say
court? Throwing themselves at him was more like it. It just doesn't
seem fair. This guy lived the dream of every male east of West
Hollywood, while the winsome females would find a week in the West
Bank less volatile than the competition they had to deal with.</LD>
<TE>   The first week found Alex, a Stanford MBA, the only man at a
cocktail party with 25 women, where he had the daunting task of
selecting 15 who would move on to the next week while living in a
sprawling Pacific Coast mansion. The 10 losers each received a
consolation bachelor, 12 credits short of a Pierce College associates
degree.</TE>
<TE>   Each succeeding week found Alex and his new friends yachting,
horseback riding, Las Vegasing, New Yorking, Hawaiiing, visiting the
women's parents (I guess they stuck that one in to qualify as a real
reality series). Weekly he whittled the female contestants down to
eight, four, three, two, until a single lady remained--Amanda, 23, an
event planner from Kansas. And he's not even marrying her. It ended
up being an entire series to find out who he would date!</TE>
<TE>   But whom he picked is of much less consequence than the damage
done to some young guy who is thinking, "This is how it's gonna be,
dude." I don't know about you, but "The Bachelor" is so reminiscent
of my bachelor days ... right after I had my eighth 100-proof
Southern Comfort Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, any hour of "The Bachelor" reminded me of that one special
night when 25 women vied for my affection. And I didn't have to be
handsome or a millionaire to get that attention for an hour. All I
needed was $2,500. A hundred each may not sound like a lot, but
remember, we're talking the '90s, when things were crazy. Marie
Osmond had an ABC sitcom, and $100 could get you a woman with a
driver.</TE>
<TE>   As a television writer, what really drives me nuts today is that I
didn't think to pitch my "$2,500 Night With Steve" to ABC back then.
Or at least Fox. Another $50 to each girl and I know I could have
gotten them to sign a release.</TE>
<TE>   Just like all my good ideas, I thought it too obvious. At best, I
thought I had an amateur video I could sell to my friends. Who knew
that I could have been attracting upward of 10 million viewers a
week--and nearly double that for the final half an hour?</TE>
<TE>   We'll probably never be able to live out Alex's reality, but with
ABC ready to order a second edition of "The Bachelor," it's the
perfect time for us guys to take advantage of the dreams Alex
awakened. Even if you're not in the business, it's time to pull out
some of those great past, almost forgotten, events in your life (or
were they just fantasies?), put together a show of your own and set
up a meeting at every cable network you can think of. Here are some
to get you started:</TE>
<TE>   "You Can Have Anyone You Want" (Comedy Central): Each week Halle
Berry, Pamela Anderson and Katie Couric fight over you.</TE>
<TE>   "The Night I'm Pretty Sure She Returned My Glance at Church"
(PAX): Each week we select a woman from a completely different pew
who may (or may not) be looking at you.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends' Mothers" (Lifetime): Anne Bancroft, Kathleen Turner and
Florence Henderson ask if you're trying to seduce them</TE>
<TE>   "I Don't' Think So"(Oxygen): Ellen DeGeneres, Rosie O'Donnell and
the Indigo Girls almost show interest in you.</TE>
<TE>   "Hard News" (CNN): Ashley Banfield, Paula Zahn and Christiane
Amanpour go to any war-torn location you want.</TE>
<TE>   "Right Night" (Fox News Channel): Ann Coulter, Laura Ingraham and
Bill O'Reilly vie for your affections and your soul.</TE>
<TE>   "Fright Night" (SciFi): Tammy Faye Baker, Martha Stewart and Joan
Rivers keep jumping out from behind your bed.</TE>
<TE>   "He ... Could ... Go ... All ... the ... Way" (ESPN): Nude
volleyball, nude basketball, nude NASCAR....</TE>
<TE>   "SpongeBob No Pants" (Nickelodeon): Jessica Rabbit, Betty Rubble
and Olive Oyl vie for your toon. Sure, it's weird, but then again,
who ever thought "The Bachelor" would do these numbers?</TE>

<HD>SAG Calls for Guild Contracts Overseas</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To the Screen Actors Guild, all the world's a sound stage. Or at
least it wants producers and studios to think that way.</LD>
<LD>   So starting Wednesday, the 98,000-member union will pressure
producers and studios, mostly by using the clout of its major stars,
to offer SAG members the equivalent of a union contract whenever they
shoot films and TV shows in foreign countries.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign, called Global Rule One, seeks to require SAG members
to refuse to act in foreign productions if they aren't offered a SAG
contract. Members who violate it risk sanctions, fines or even
expulsion from the union.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, SAG has enforced its basic rule of conduct for actors
only in U.S. productions. But with the explosion in recent years of
film and TV shows shot in Canada, Australia and Mexico--as well as
such areas as Ireland, Morocco and Eastern Europe, which have seen
recent filming booms--SAG wants to make sure actors at least get
SAG-like contracts whenever they must travel.</TE>
<TE>   SAG contracts require such things as contributions by producers to
the union's health and pension fund, minimum guaranteed pay rates,
residual payments when work is rerun and an array of work rules
including safety measures, rest periods and what kind of penalty a
producer pays if an actor is required to work through a meal.</TE>
<TE>   Honoring a SAG contract overseas "shouldn't even be an issue,"
said Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, one of the leaders in the
campaign. The extra costs for movie studios would be tiny, "probably
less than 3% of the entire budget of a film," Spacey said.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. producers and studios and Canadian production companies
are gearing up to fight the campaign, complaining that the union
wants to exceed the reach of its contract without negotiating at the
bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a violation to adopt or promote a rule which would violate
the collective bargaining agreement," said J. Nicholas Counter,
president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers,
the labor-negotiating arm of major Hollywood studios and producers.</TE>
<TE>   SAG estimates that 1,500 of its actors work in foreign productions
in a typical year, and that producers avoid paying about $7 million
to the union's health and pension fund. Major stars probably won't
benefit from the campaign because they have the negotiating leverage
to get deals that far exceed the benefits of the guild contract.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, some of Hollywood's biggest actors have been
recruited to use their clout by insisting that producers who want
them in foreign productions cut a deal with SAG first. The growing
list of names includes Harrison Ford, Samuel L. Jackson, Clint
Eastwood, Sarah Michelle Gellar and cast members from such hit TV
shows as "The West Wing" and "The Sopranos."</TE>
<TE>   SAG estimates that about 40 TV series, 125 movies of the week and
60 feature films are shot annually in foreign countries.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those offer SAG contracts anyway. "Gladiator," which was
shot in Morocco, Italy, Malta and Britain, used 80 SAG members who
had guild contracts, the union said. Recent productions that didn't
have SAG contracts included "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of
the Ring," "The Mummy Returns" and George Lucas' latest "Star Wars"
films, although individual actors in those films may have negotiated
deals to give them SAG contracts, the union said. Actors who didn't
have SAG contracts won't be penalized because the films were shot
before the campaign started.</TE>
<TE>   Counter believes that some of SAG's criticism is unfair, noting
that SAG actors who work in Canada can have pension and health
contributions made to the union's fund on their behalf through an
arrangement with the Alliance of Canadian Television and Radio
Artists.</TE>
<TE>   SAG argues that studios frequently set up shell companies to
expressly avoid offering SAG contracts, which Counter denies. But SAG
Chief Executive Robert Pisano said he knows firsthand that it happens
because he helped set them up as an executive in the 1980s at
Paramount Pictures and in the 1990s at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.</TE>
<TE>   SAG officials argue that opposition from studios and producers is
disingenuous because they agreed in contract negotiations to a clause
that says they will "continue to use their best efforts to provide
the protection of the Screen Actors Guild contract for American
performers working outside of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Counter insists that studios and producers do that when possible.
He said that although his members must offer actors SAG contracts
because they signed the guild's collective bargaining agreement, they
also buy films and TV shows from foreign companies that will be
forced to raise prices if they are required to offer the union
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment lawyer Alan Brunswick of Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips
in Los Angeles believes the issue reflects the growing frustration
actors have in trying to stem the growth in runaway production, and
predicts that the issue may well end up being decided in court.</TE>
<TE>   Spacey said that the issue is one of fairness and that the debate
"unfortunately ... comes down to greed." He noted that studios and
producers allow members of the Directors Guild of America to be
covered by their guild's contract wherever they shoot in foreign
countries. He said actors should be extended the same rights.</TE>
<TE>   "An actor should never have to be put in a position where someone
can say, 'By the way, we're not going to pay your health benefits or
give you residuals, and you're not going to have a SAG contract,'"
Spacey said.</TE>

<HD>Saudis Weighing Partial Privatizing of Aramco</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>Saudi Arabia is considering privatizing some of the operations of
state-owned Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil-producing company in the
world, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said.</LD>
<LD>   Naimi, addressing Saudi Aramco staffers in Houston on Saturday,
did not elaborate. But Western and Saudi industry sources said they
believed he was referring to Saudi Aramco's ancillary operations and
not the kingdom's key oil and gas facilities.</LD>
<LD>   "We are also studying the possibility of privatizing some of Saudi
Aramco's operations," Naimi said in his speech.</LD>
<TE>   Oil industry sources said the kingdom has been considering the
idea of privatization at Saudi Aramco since the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Saudi Aramco, as with many state-run oil firms, has been
reviewing this concept for several years," said an industry source in
the region. "They are thinking of hiving off services in the medical,
housing, transport and educational sectors."</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Aramco was a joint venture with private oil companies until
the 1980s, when the Saudi government acquired a 100% interest in its
assets. The oil giant offers myriad staff benefits through service
units it owns.</TE>
<TE>   Naimi also spoke of the kingdom's decision--unveiled at an energy
conference in November in Riyadh, the capital--to set up a publicly
held energy services company.</TE>
<TE>   The holding company, which could draw initial investment of $160
million to $220 million, would be similar but not identical to giant
Saudi Basic Industries Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Naimi said Saudi Aramco outsources many support services to the
Saudi private sector to help spread the wealth generated by its oil
production.</TE>
<TE>   Majority ownership in the company would come courtesy of the Saudi
private sector, while the government would participate through two
existing oil services companies--Arabian Drilling and Arabian
Geophysical &amp; Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi corporate law prohibits foreign firms from investing in
joint stock companies, but they would be allowed to form joint
ventures with subsidiaries of the holding company.</TE>

<HD>Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac Face New Scrutiny Over Derivatives</HD>
<DH>Securities: Critics including Greenspan question the use of
such complex contracts by the two mortgage giants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EILEEN ALT POWELL</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s extensive use of derivatives has been widely blamed for
masking financial problems at the Texas energy trading company, which
collapsed late last year. Now some are criticizing the use of these
complex contracts in another business, the mortgage market.</LD>
<LD>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week took aim at the
use of derivatives by the two government-sponsored behemoths of
mortgages: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal National Mortgage Assn., created by Congress during
the Depression, and later the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. were
given access to emergency lines of credit from the government and
exemptions from some securities regulations. Their mission is to
create a secondary market in mortgages to make it easier for
Americans to buy homes.</LD>
<TE>   Though backed by the government, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are
private companies with shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
They have grown so large that they are involved in nearly half the
mortgages written in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan long has opposed government subsidies for private
business, arguing that they give the recipients unfair advantages and
distort the free market.</TE>
<TE>   He expanded on his concerns last week, saying in a video address
to the Institute of International Finance that even the perception of
government support might induce institutional investors in the
mortgage companies "to apply less vigorously some of the risk
controls that they apply to manage their over-the-counter derivatives
exposure."</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages written by banks, brokers
and mortgage companies. They then "package" them and sell investors
securities based on the mortgage packages. The process keeps money
flowing into the mortgage market.</TE>
<TE>   Derivatives come into play for mortgages that Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac purchase and hold in their own portfolios. Derivatives
are contracts--generally with money-center banks and large
institutional investors--whose value is based on the performance of
an underlying asset, and they are used to hedge, or reduce the risk
from, interest rate fluctuations.</TE>
<TE>   Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were quick to respond to
Greenspan's criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Jayne Shontell, Fannie Mae's senior vice president for investor
relations, said in a statement that the companies involved in the
hedges "are large, sophisticated, leading financial institutions."
She added that "we see no evidence that our derivatives
counterparties are applying anything less than careful credit
judgment in their transactions with us."</TE>
<TE>   Freddie Mac spokesman David Palombi emphasized that derivatives
were used to reduce interest rate risk, not for speculation. Big
investors "evaluate us very thoroughly--just as much as we evaluate
them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the issue of derivatives in the
mortgage market has arisen. In spring 1999, an alliance of banks,
brokerages and mortgage companies that were alarmed at the increasing
dominance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac came together as FM Watch.</TE>
<TE>   Its Web site, www.fmwatch.org, rails against what it sees as
"risky hedging in the derivatives market" by Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac and other activities it believes undercut competition in the
mortgage market.</TE>
<TE>   Charles A. Gabriel Jr., an analyst at Prudential Financial in
Washington, said critics would have a tough time getting Congress to
act because the companies have been so successful in helping millions
of families obtain mortgages. Two-thirds of Americans own their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Even the critics can't dispute the fact that Fannie and Freddie
have made the mortgage process more efficient and cut the cost of a
mortgage by at least a quarter of a percentage point for the average
American," Gabriel said. "This system is the envy of the world."</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the companies were able to do this with an
"implicit government subsidy," which requires no cash outlay. Take
away the credit lines and other concessions, he said, and the
government might have to support housing with cash
subsidies--something it would be loath to do at a time of deepening
budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also have good reputations for
financial soundness.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service, which long has rated the companies'
debt securities, earlier this year gave them each a "bank financial
strength" rating of A-minus, making them among the highest-rated
financial firms globally.</TE>

<HD>Hacker Key to Firm's Future</HD>
<DH>Security: Marc Maiffret turned a mischievous hobby into a
lucrative consulting enterprise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By his own account, Marc Maiffret had been up to no good. In and out
of several computer hacker groups, the high school dropout realized
his life had to change one morning shortly after he turned 17 when he
was awakened by an FBI agent holding a gun to his head.</LD>
<LD>   Today, at 21, Maiffret consults on computer matters with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and other federal agencies and earns
a six-figure salary at a privately held Aliso Viejo company he
co-founded, EEye Digital Security Inc.</LD>
<LD>   "I never thought I would have been where I am today. It's such an
amazing feeling," Maiffret (pronounced MAY-fray) said. "It's been
like a crazy, crazy, crazy journey."</LD>
<TE>   Although many hackers have turned up as security consultants, few
have helped put a new company on track for success. EEye has garnered
accolades both for its knack for finding major flaws in popular
software programs and for the cutting-edge products it develops to
help halt hacker attacks.</TE>
<TE>   And EEye is starting to flourish, with sales running at about $1
million a month and profit rolling in since midsummer, said Firas
Bushnaq, the company's co-chief executive. Industry experts say the
company is well-positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth in
what is expected to be a $6.6-billion industry this year.</TE>
<TE>   Since its start in 1998, EEye has uncovered a dozen problems with
Microsoft Corp. software--from the Windows XP operating system to
programs for Web servers, which manage access and interaction for
Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, the Redmond, Wash., behemoth came out with a
patch to fix an EEye-discovered flaw in Web server software that
could have given a hacker control of servers. And last fall, right
after Microsoft released its XP operating system as its most secure
ever, EEye found a gaping hole that could allow hackers to take
control of individual personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   "They do their homework," said Steven B. Lipner, director of
security assurance for Microsoft, which this year made security a top
priority. "The reports [on flaws] they send us have been
well-researched and are high-quality."</TE>
<TE>   Maiffret and his colleagues--20 engineers and 14 staff workers in
Orange County and 16 salespeople in Europe, mostly in their 20s--even
earned grudging praise from bigger competitor Internet Security
Systems Inc. in Atlanta, which itself had to fix flaws EEye found in
its products last month.</TE>
<TE>   "They're very skilled at what they do," said Chris Rouland,
director of Internet Security's X-Force research group.</TE>
<TE>   Security Initially Was a Sideline for Company</TE>
<TE>   The hacking work has helped EEye develop tools that now are used
by such major companies as Edison International, AT&amp;T Corp.,
Honeywell Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Microsoft, as well as by
federal agencies, which EEye wouldn't name.</TE>
<TE>   Its Retina network scanner is widely regarded as one of the better
tools at uncovering security vulnerabilities on a network. Its
SecureIIS network firewall for Microsoft Web servers uses a new
method of identifying attacks to block not only known viruses but
also new ones that follow hacking patterns. Its Iris program analyzes
network traffic for bugs as data comes in. A new product, Blink, due
out this summer, is a firewall for individual workstations.</TE>
<TE>   Bushnaq, 34, whose ECompany Inc. created EEye, credits Maiffret
for helping redirect operations. ECompany started out in the 1990s as
yet another electronic-commerce firm, offering several services to
online businesses. Security was a sideline until one employee asked
Bushnaq in early 1998 if his 17-year-old roommate could try hacking
into the firm's computers.</TE>
<TE>   "The next day, Marc walks in with a listing of all my workstations
and other information I thought was secure," said Bushnaq, a native
Jordanian who moved to the U.S. when he was 16 and earned a degree in
computer engineering. "I said, 'Would you like a job?' and he said,
'That's why I did this.'"</TE>
<TE>   After Maiffret joined ECompany, the sideline quickly took center
stage, and the baby-faced kid with spiked hair--colored green this
month--took the unique title of chief hacking officer. EEye has
picked up two rounds of venture financing totaling $7 million and is
looking for a partner to help it build the company. Bushnaq said EEye
has just signed a distribution contract with Ingram Micro Inc., the
world's largest distributor of computer products.</TE>
<TE>   For Maiffret, the job became a liberating experience after he'd
been engulfed by cyberspace for three years, learning to write codes
and hanging out with hacking groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I was up to no good, but it was more for research," he maintains.
"I never destroyed anything."</TE>
<TE>   After getting his first computer at the end of ninth grade,
Maiffret moved with his mother and his two sisters from Irvine to
Trabuco Canyon in south Orange County, where he had no friends and
all summer to devote to the computer. A tinkerer who had taken apart
televisions and radios to see how they worked, Maiffret was quickly
bored with computer games and began learning how to devise them and
other programs.</TE>
<TE>   By the time summer was over, he was starting to hack into computer
networks, and by the middle of 10th grade, he dropped out. "I knew
what I wanted to do in life, and I didn't see where high school would
help," he said. But he couldn't get a job in Internet security.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, from his computer in the garage, Maiffret traveled the
world, moving in and out of hacking groups under the name Chameleon,
which he took from a ninth-grader's remark about his computer skills.
He even managed to get onto some government Web sites, a far less
serious event than breaking into secure networks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the thrill of getting into systems. I didn't open any
files," he said. "I knew I shouldn't be doing it, but we weren't
malicious. For example, at a company that sold furs, we'd leave a
message saying something about not killing animals."</TE>
<TE>   His adventures came to a halt when some hacker acquaintances broke
into government computers and reportedly downloaded software that
controls the positioning of satellites. A man named Ibrahim wanted to
buy the software from Maiffret, who said he never saw or had the
program, and left $1,000 in money orders at a commercial post office
box. The teenager collected the money, using part of it to buy one of
his sisters a Nintendo game.</TE>
<TE>   Some security Web sites identified Ibrahim as a terrorist, but
Maiffret said that when he asked the FBI about it, he was told that
this wasn't true and not to worry about it. "He disappeared after the
raid," Maiffret said, leading security experts to believe that
Ibrahim was an FBI front.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, though, was monitoring Maiffret's activities. One morning
in spring 1998, while he was sleeping, nearly two dozen agents raided
the home, pulling his mother screaming from the shower and putting a
gun to Maiffret's head and handcuffing him. After hours of
questioning about satellite software, they left without arresting him
but took his computer.</TE>
<TE>   "That was my wake-up call," Maiffret said.</TE>
<TE>   A week after the raid, he said, he and his mother had dinner with
the lead FBI investigator and never heard from him again until last
summer--when the agency returned his outdated computer. As far as
Maiffret was concerned then, he had nothing to hide. Bushnaq agreed,
and kept the young hacker on staff.</TE>
<TE>   For EEye, it proved to be a good move.</TE>
<TE>   Maiffret has become a leading industry force in discovering areas
of software that are vulnerable to attacks, but his first foray was
nearly disastrous. In June 1999, he found a serious flaw in the
Internet, a hole that could give an attacker control of a server.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft, whose software runs 27% of about 14 million active
servers worldwide, didn't act quickly to fix the problem and, after a
few days, ignored EEye's e-mail messages. A week after uncovering the
flaw, EEye began issuing alerts on security Web sites, releasing
enough information to show that the teen and the upstart company knew
what they were talking about.</TE>
<TE>   The information, however, also was detailed enough for a good
hacker to figure out the flaw and exploit it. Microsoft then issued a
patch to cover the hole, but both sides came under heavy criticism by
the security community.</TE>
<TE>   Blamed by Some for Paving Way to Code Red</TE>
<TE>   With Maiffret only a year removed from the FBI raid, most of the
flak was aimed at EEye for disclosing the information. Others
contended that with so many servers open to attack, Microsoft dragged
its feet in fixing the problem and that EEye acted properly.</TE>
<TE>   Both firms now say they have developed a professional working
relationship, but EEye continued to suffer in the security world.</TE>
<TE>   "Releasing an exploit code, that is something you should not do.
It's like firemen who are arsonists," said John Pescatore, a Gartner
Group Inc. security analyst who worked at the National Security
Agency. "I think EEye has moved beyond that, and I don't think Marc
Maiffret being there is a negative. Having someone like him driving
the issue, finding the holes, is a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some critics blamed EEye's release last year of
information on how one hole worked for leading to the Code Red worm,
a devastating bug that quickly ripped through more than 750,000
servers worldwide and cost more than $2.5 billion in repairs,
according to industry estimates. EEye's products, the company said,
could have prevented it.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been finding vulnerabilities left and right--and they
have all the programs that could fix them," said John Vranesevich, a
Beaver, Pa., operator of Anti- Online.com, which tracks hackers.
Pescatore, who lauds EEye's technology and products, still notes that
the company is "tainted with the brush of ambulance chasing."</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft's Lipner said EEye acted properly. Microsoft had a
patch out a month before the bug hit, he said, and was "pretty
aggressive" about getting customers to install it. Too many, though,
failed to add the patch, he said.</TE>
<TE>   With attacks growing and getting more sophisticated, Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates said in a January e-mail to employees that
security now is the company's "highest priority." After Code Red and
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Lipner said, "we are seeing heavy
traffic in customers pulling down patches from our Web site."</TE>

<HD>An Urban Garden Nurtures Hope--and a Business Model</HD>
<DH>Entrepreneurship: A student-run food company thrives 10
years after arising from the L.A. riots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a verdant Westside sanctuary--a world away from the rocky soil of
South-Central Los Angeles--Dennis Fomond tills land that will yield
basil, peppers, string beans and other crops.</LD>
<LD>   Fomond, 26, is an O.G.--not an original gangster but one of half a
dozen "original gardeners" who planted a seed in a weed-choked lot
behind Crenshaw High School after the 1992 riots and helped launch
Food From the 'Hood.</LD>
<LD>   That seed has grown, 10 years later, into one of the most
successful student-run companies in the country, based on revenue and
longevity, experts on youth entrepreneurship said.</LD>
<TE>   The students began by selling vegetables locally and expanded to
sell salad dressing at supermarket chains nationwide including Kroger
Co.'s Ralphs and Safeway Inc.'s Vons and Safeway stores. Expected
revenue this year: $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although he graduated long ago, Fomond returns regularly to help
nurture a new crop of student managers.</TE>
<TE>   The garden--the symbolic heart of the program--moved this year to
a plot at the Veterans Administration complex in Westwood from its
longtime home at Crenshaw High, where the program was founded in
October 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the nonprofit organization maintains an office at a
business incubator about two miles from the high school in South Los
Angeles. The group contracts with local manufacturers to produce its
Straight Out 'the Garden salad dressing, which provides most of the
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Food From the 'Hood was among the first forays into what has
become a nationwide movement to deliver entrepreneurial training to
inner-city youths.</TE>
<TE>   The aims: to develop future business owners and show that, given
the opportunity, central-city teens can do more than riot and sell
something other than drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "Food From the 'Hood paved the way for getting people to think
about how to do a product that kids from an urban area could sell
nationally. And that's no easy task," said Steve Mariotti, president
of the New York-based National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of low-income people are never exposed to [business]
ownership principles," Mariotti said. "The ones who most need to know
are the least likely to have that exposure. Food From the 'Hood
showed what can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Participants receive adult guidance--initially by Tammy Bird, the
Crenshaw biology teacher whose vision helped launch the program, and
today by Monique Hunter, who joined as a board member in 2000 and
last year took over as the salaried executive director.</TE>
<TE>   But at Food From the 'Hood, the students call the shots.</TE>
<TE>   The Crenshaw High students, ages 14 to 18, handle everything from
negotiating with vendors to signing off on a new salad dressing
recipe, Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   Program Branches Into Retailing</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, the program expanded from the student-run garden to begin
producing Straight Out 'the Garden dressing, which has become the
true cash crop.</TE>
<TE>   Half the proceeds from dressing sales fund college scholarships,
which students earn by working in the program and accumulating points
that can be converted to dollars. As of June, 77 students had
graduated from the program, earning a collective $177,000 in
scholarships (about $2,300 on average).</TE>
<TE>   Hunter said she wishes it could be more. But when sales suffer--as
they have since 1998--so do scholarships.</TE>
<TE>   The program remains dependent on a fluctuating flow of government
and foundation grants to augment income and keep operating. Some
awards, such as a $150,000 grant announced this month by the Merrill
Lynch Foundation, fund specific goals, including the promotion of
financial education. Others help pay the salaries of Hunter and other
staffers.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the program relies on continuing input from Fomond
and fellow O.G.s.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent sun-drenched Saturday, gardening tools at the ready,
he walked the bumpy path from a rest area to the group's
15-by-30-foot plot at the Veterans Administration complex. The
students get to use the land in exchange for assisting VA gardening
projects.</TE>
<TE>   The yield from the efforts of Fomond and other gardeners is used
in taste-test demonstrations for the dressing or is donated to
homeless shelters. (Produce from the garden was never used in the
dressing but until recently was sold at farmers markets.)</TE>
<TE>   Fomond, a beefy and affable father of two young girls, studied for
two years at UC Berkeley after graduating from high school.</TE>
<TE>   He had always fancied himself a linebacker. But at Berkeley, his
emphasis shifted from the NFL toward learning more about African
American business.</TE>
<TE>   "Food From the 'Hood influenced that," said Fomond, a student
owner in the program from 1992 to 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually went into stores and talked to corporate buyers," he
said. "It just showed me that it's an attainable goal--that anything
is attainable if you put your mind to it."</TE>
<TE>   Paula Avalos, 18, began refocusing her career goals after working
with Food From the 'Hood for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "When I graduated from high school, I was thinking of majoring in
business because of this experience," said Avalos, a member of
Crenshaw's Class of 2001 who attends Santa Monica College. "It made
me want to focus on business."</TE>
<TE>   Today, she said, she is weighing whether to pursue business,
public administration or criminal justice.</TE>
<TE>   Student Gardeners Learn Lessons for Life</TE>
<TE>   Whichever paths they choose, Fomond and Avalos agree that the
program gave them skills that go beyond the garden: negotiating, team
building, moving forward despite setbacks--and there have been some.</TE>
<TE>   Take the poorly formulated dressing that virtually exploded out of
the bottles and had to be scrapped. Or the contractions within the
grocery industry that saw the number of chains available to carry the
product shrink on what felt like a weekly basis.</TE>
<TE>   A media blitz between the launch of the dressing and the five-year
anniversary of the riots, which included a visit by Britain's Prince
Charles, helped keep sales brisk, Hunter said. Charles' brother
Prince Edward is scheduled to visit Crenshaw today and receive a gift
basket from Food From the 'Hood.</TE>
<TE>   But since 1998, sales have slipped. This year, the student-managed
company is expected to gross nearly double last year's $150,000 but
still fall shy of the glory days.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to increase outlets, Hunter said, the group is in
discussions to sell its products at stores operated by Costco
Wholesale Corp. and Smart &amp; Final Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Food From the 'Hood also hopes to produce a guide to sell to
groups that want to learn how to launch similar operations, Hunter
said.</TE>
<TE>   But first, she said, she must pull the "weeds" from her own
garden.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we're looking at do we have the best business practices? How
can we make this more efficient?" Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing to start something like this," she said. "It's
another thing to see it continue on."</TE>

<HD>Grammy in Transition After Greene Resigns</HD>
<DH>Music: Trustees plan to take a close look at how the
organization was managed under former regime.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The music industry was abuzz Sunday over the sudden resignation of C.
Michael Greene as president of the Grammy organization and about the
future direction of the influential industry group.</LD>
<LD>   The controversial Grammy chief abruptly resigned Saturday in an
emergency board meeting at the Beverly Hilton Hotel attended by 38
trustees.</LD>
<LD>   The meeting was arranged by Grammy Chairman Garth Fundis to
present the findings of a sexual harassment investigation to the
group's board.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, the Grammy organization released a statement saying
that the investigation had cleared Greene of any wrongdoing and that
he would stay on as a consultant during the management transition.</TE>
<TE>   The statement did not explain why Greene resigned from the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the nonprofit
organization that he headed for 13 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We thank Mike for his years of service and the contributions he's
made to the organization and to the music community," Fundis said.</TE>
<TE>   "I also want to state that a full and fair investigation of
alleged misconduct by Mike was completed and it revealed no sexual
harassment, no sex discrimination and no hostile work environment at
the Recording Academy."</TE>
<TE>   Greene, 52, had three years left on his employment contract and
will be paid as much as $8 million as part of a severance package,
sources close to the Grammy negotiations said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Greene offered no explanation about why he resigned.
But he released the following statement: "I am so proud of what we've
been able to accomplish together over the past 13 years and am
gratified by the growth and success of the organization and our
mission.... " he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have built a spectacular senior management team, and I will
work with the senior staff to ensure a seamless, smooth and
successful transition."</TE>
<TE>   Music industry executives traded phone calls Sunday about Greene's
surprise exit--wondering why the Grammy veteran would step down if
the report exonerated him.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, senior Grammy executives gathered Sunday for meetings
at the Santa Monica-based academy with Fundis and other volunteer
trustees for the first in a series of staff evaluations, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fundis will serve as interim Grammy chief, but it is unclear who
will succeed Greene. Potential candidates were floated among the
board--Neil Portnow, a Los Angeles record executive at Jive Records,
and Bill Ivey, former Grammy official and head of the National
Endowment for Arts under President Clinton, Grammy sources said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday several Grammy trustees privately said the board viewed
Greene's resignation as the first step to make the organization more
democratic, with a clearer focus on its core mission to serve members
of the recording community.</TE>
<TE>   During Greene's tenure the influence of the Grammy organization
grew dramatically, and its awards show became a major television
event with a great effect on record sales.</TE>
<TE>   CBS pays the academy more than $20 million a year to broadcast the
Grammy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   But Greene also was viewed by many in the music industry as a
dominant executive whose influence carried throughout the Grammy
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Grammy trustees now intend to take a close look at how the
organization's 120 employees and its $50 million in assets were
managed under the Greene regime. Some board members want to bring in
an independent analyst to scrutinize how the Grammy organization and
its philanthropic arms, MusiCares and the Grammy Foundation, might
operate more efficiently and serve the music community more
effectively.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, some trustees privately questioned whether the academy
should continue sinking millions of dollars into projects such as
Encore Hall, a Greene-driven proposal to build a retirement home for
aging musicians with some government funding. Those trustees believe
the funds might be put to better use by exploring other ventures,
such as starting a health insurance program for artists and recording
technicians.</TE>
<TE>   Some Grammy employees and trustees also believe the nonprofit
group could do more to get the word out to indigent musicians about
existing academy programs to help them pay for rent, food and
clothing and to help with substance abuse problems. Academy funds,
they say, also could be used to help artists establish pensions and
better contracts with record companies.</TE>
<TE>   Greene was paid $2 million-plus in salary and bonuses each year.
But the next president will be paid less and will serve the interests
of the board--previously cut out from most policymaking decisions
under Greene, Grammy sources said.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the Grammy trustees are scheduled to meet in Hawaii to
discuss future plans for the academy.</TE>

<HD>Until Baldness Has a Better Cure, There's Hair Storage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL LIEDTKE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As entrepreneurs cast about Silicon Valley for lucrative new ideas,
Mike Blaylock thinks he has found a gold mine in an underground vault
filled with hair.</LD>
<LD>   The shorn tresses come from the heads of men and women who dread
the day they might go bald.</LD>
<LD>   Blaylock's San Francisco start-up, Hairogenics Inc., is offering
to preserve the strands until science finds a better cure for
baldness. He reasons that if sheep already can be cloned, it's only a
matter of time before some biotechnology firm finds a way to
duplicate real hair.</LD>
<TE>   When that day comes, Blaylock says, bald people will be glad they
paid Hairogenics to stash their hair in a climate- controlled vault
14 feet below a Portland, Ore., hair salon. The cost: $49.95 for the
initial hair-collection kit and a $10 annual storage fee after that.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a sensitive issue for a lot of men out there," said
Blaylock, 32, whose own locks are receding. "We definitely think
there is going to be plenty of demand for this kind of service."</TE>
<TE>   Hairogenics, funded with less than $100,000, can't accept just any
hair deposit. The company needs a dry sample so the tufts can be
placed in a vacuum-sealed, waterproof package.</TE>
<TE>   Hairogenics already has signed up nearly 200 customers, even
though the start-up isn't officially opening its doors until today.</TE>

<HD>John Wayne Airport Adds First International Flight</HD>
<DH>Travel: Alaska Airlines begins daily nonstop service to
Vancouver. Growing demand puts focus on capacity at regional hubs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although plans for an international airport at the former El Toro
Marine base were ceremoniously scrapped last week, nearby John Wayne
Airport in Orange County quietly became one on its own Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The addition of Alaska Airlines' nonstop daily service to
Vancouver, Canada, marked the first international flight from Orange
County in the airport's 60-year history, said Ann McCarley, airport
spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   McCarley said the new service is still within John Wayne's noise
and passenger limits and will not change airport operations. The
county limits to 73 the number of commercial flights allowed each day
by the loudest aircraft and a maximum 8.4 million passengers per
year.</LD>
<TE>   "Certainly we're happy we can now offer international service to
Canada," McCarley said. "But it's basically up to the individual
carriers where they want their services to be within those
restrictions, not us."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of regional airport capacities is of concern now that an
El Toro airport--which could have accommodated as many as 30 million
passengers by 2025--is no longer an option. The growing demand for
air travel in Southern California probably will be redistributed to
Los Angeles, San Diego, Ontario and, despite current restrictions,
John Wayne, or the region could lose lucrative international air
service to other states.</TE>
<TE>   Ontario has provided international service since 1993, even though
it carried the "international airport" title since 1946 due to cargo
flights it handled then to the South Pacific, a spokesman said.
AeroMexico is Ontario's only international carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaska Airlines is promoting its Vancouver
service from John Wayne with an inaugural fare of $107 each way for
travel completed by Aug. 30.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As the first-quarter earnings season recedes in the rearview mirror,
some are speeding ahead in reaction to data showing results beat Wall
Street forecasts by an average of 3.2% as strong consumer spending
helped underpin the economy, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call.</LD>
<LD>   Wrapping up the earnings season this week are some stragglers,
including consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., energy trader
Dynegy Inc. and Cigna Corp., the No. 3 U.S. health insurer.</LD>
<LD>   Financial road signs are pointing to even better results ahead.
Early indications suggest the second-quarter pre-announcement period,
when companies predict whether they will meet forecasts, may prove to
be the strongest on record.</LD>
<TE>   Of the 388 pre-announcements collected so far, 39% have been
positive and 43% have been negative. That's the strongest ratio since
First Call began collecting such data in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   But market watchers note the strength is mostly in small and
mid-size consumer-related companies, while larger firms that sell to
businesses are still struggling to meet earlier projections.</TE>

<HD>Reports Expected on Jobs, Manufacturing</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. businesses added workers and manufacturing expanded in April
after the economy grew in the first quarter at the strongest pace in
more than two years, reports this week are likely to show.</LD>
<LD>   About 60,000 jobs were added this month after an increase of
58,000 in March, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg
News. The Labor Department's report on Friday may show April's rise
in payrolls to be the biggest since February 2001, a month before the
economy slipped into recession.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturing grew for a third straight month, the Institute for
Supply Management is expected to report on Wednesday. Production is
picking up to meet demand at a time when businesses have reduced
inventories by record amounts.</LD>
<TE>   A lack of pent-up consumer demand may limit economic growth later
in the year after the first quarter's 5.8% rate of expansion. A
Commerce Department report today is expected to show that personal
spending increased 0.4% in March, the smallest rise since December.
Incomes probably increased 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics on Tuesday from the New York-based Conference Board are
likely to reinforce expectations that consumers won't increase their
spending in coming months.</TE>
<TE>   The group's consumer confidence index is expected to show a
decline to 107.5 in April from 110.2 in March, which was the highest
since August. Sentiment probably receded during the month because of
worries surrounding the crisis in the Middle East, higher energy
costs and a sluggish stock market, economists said.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Commerce Department probably will report a 0.1%
decline in March construction spending after a 1.1% surge in
February.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the Institute for Supply Management probably will report
that service and other business excluding manufacturing expanded in
April. The index of non-manufacturing activity probably held above
the break-even point of 50.</TE>

<HD>Baptists' Suit Against Andersen to Go to Trial</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Embattled accounting firm Arthur Andersen, fighting for survival
after a federal obstruction of justice charge, goes to an Arizona
court this week to face investors who claim it failed to flag fraud
that triggered the largest nonprofit bankruptcy in U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   Jury selection is set to begin today in the case brought by the
trust for the Baptist Foundation of Arizona, which alleges Andersen
failed to do its job as auditor of the organization, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in 1999, causing 11,000 mostly elderly
investors to lose $570 million.</LD>
<LD>   Chicago-based Andersen was indicted on charges of criminal
obstruction of justice after a federal probe into the destruction of
records from audits of Enron Corp., the Houston-based energy trader.</LD>
<TE>   The Phoenix case, which preceded the Enron debacle, was supposed
to have been dismissed after Andersen agreed to pay $217 million to
settle the class-action suit by former investors in the foundation as
well as a civil suit by state regulators and proceedings by the
Arizona Board of Accountancy.</TE>
<TE>   But the March 1 settlement deal fell apart just four weeks later
when Andersen's insurance company refused to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Opening statements could begin in Maricopa County Superior Court
as early as Tuesday.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. auto sales may slip less than 1% this month, the best
performance so far this year, as discounts draw shoppers into
showrooms and General Motors Corp.'s fleet sales to companies start
to recover.</LD>
<LD>   Car and light-truck sales probably fell 0.8% from April 2001,
based on the average forecast of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News.</LD>
<LD>   The analysts have underestimated sales every month this year, so
the actual figures may go into positive territory for the first time
since December when auto makers report results Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Auto makers are using discounts, no-interest loans and low-rate
leases to stoke demand. GM is forecast to have a 1.7% increase, while
sales fell about 1.6% at DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler and 10% at Ford
Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, GM is expected to sign a final agreement Tuesday to buy
assets of South Korea's bankrupt Daewoo Motor. The $2-billion deal,
capping more than a year of talks, would dramatically boost its
presence in one of Asia's fastest-growing car markets, where Daewoo
sold more than 170,000 automobiles last year and GM sold fewer than
300.</TE>

<HD>Argentine Peso to Float, Banks to Reopen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Argentina's new economy minister will allow banks to reopen and a
battered currency to float today, emphasizing his free market and
pro-IMF credentials and appeasing a cash-hungry public unable last
week to access ATMs or use credit cards.</LD>
<LD>   "The economy has to be oxygenated," Roberto Lavagna said in an
interview with Clarin newspaper on Sunday, a few days after his
predecessor resigned amid a mounting financial crisis that forced the
government to close banks for a week.</LD>
<LD>   The move to reopen banks and foreign exchange markets will give
some relief to Argentines, already hit by a currency devaluation and
a four-year recession. They were squeezed even more last week after
the government tightened a five-month-long deposit freeze to stop a
drain on a collapsing financial system.</LD>
<TE>   The decision to allow the peso to trade freely also will please
the International Monetary Fund and investors, worried after
President Eduardo Duhalde hinted he could fix the peso after it
slumped 70% against the dollar this year and sparked rising
inflation.</TE>

<LD>Question: I work in a small travel agency and am paid hourly. My
employer holds mandatory staff meetings every other week at noon and
orders take-out food.</LD>
<LD>   Shouldn't we be paid for these meetings?</LD>
<LD>   B.G., Redondo Beach</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Yes. As a penalty for denying you an uninterrupted
half-an-hour meal period, you are legally entitled to receive one
hour's pay.</TE>
<TE>   In general, hourly employees have a legal right to take a
half-an-hour lunch break and two 10-minute breaks during every
eight-hour shift. Unlike rest breaks, meal periods are unpaid and
taken on non-work time.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, if your lunch period or a rest break is
denied or interrupted by work, your employer must pay you one hour's
pay at your regular wage rate for each workday that the meal or rest
period was not provided. The meal-period violation is not excused
because your employer provided takeout food.</TE>
<TE>   If your employer will not give you the hour's pay you are owed for
each violation, you should file a complaint with the California Labor
Commissioner or consult an employment attorney.</TE>

<TE>   Bonus, Once Earned, Can't Be Withdrawn</TE>
<TE>   Q: After I gave my two-week notice and worked the two weeks, my
former employer created a new policy of not paying bonuses if the
employee is no longer employed on the date of distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Is that legal? I earned my quarterly bonus, working past the end
of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   --T.S., El Segundo</TE>
<TE>   A: Regardless of the distribution date, if the employer promises
in advance to pay a bonus and you have earned it, it can't be
withdrawn retroactively.</TE>
<TE>   You should review the wording of the prior bonus policy, including
the type of bonus that was promised. Bonuses that are announced to
employees to give them an incentive to work more steadily or
efficiently, or to remain with the company, are regarded as part of
the employees' regular pay.</TE>
<TE>   These bonuses are considered wages, and an employer who fails to
pay them upon an employee's termination is subject to "waiting time"
penalties of up to 30 days of daily wages from the time the bonus was
due.</TE>

<TE>   Forwarding Workers' 401(k) Contributions</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am paid biweekly. Until this year, my 401(k) deductions were
credited to my account a few days after each paycheck was received.</TE>
<TE>   After being acquired by a larger company, we have been told that
our 401(k) accounts will be credited monthly. This means that my
contributions from the first paycheck of the month are not credited
for five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, I am giving my employer an interest-free loan of my
retirement funds. This adds up to a substantial amount of money for a
large company with thousands of employees.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, how quickly must employers deposit contributions to
an employee's 401(k) account?</TE>
<TE>   K.C., Glendale</TE>
<TE>   A: The law requires that the employer forward employee
contributions to the plan as soon as those contributions can
reasonably be segregated from the employer's general assets. However,
this date can't be later than the 15th business day of the month
after the month in which such amounts would otherwise have been
payable to the employee in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Some employers have mistakenly assumed that, in all cases, they
need not forward the contributions until the 15th business day of the
following month.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department, which is responsible for enforcing this
rule, typically requires that contributions be forwarded at a much
earlier date. But the deadline depends on the facts and circumstances
of each employer.</TE>
<TE>   If you believe your employer is not forwarding the employee
contributions in a timely manner, you should contact the Labor
Department. The general phone number for the department's Pasadena
office is (626) 229-1000.</TE>

<HD>Overcoming the Single-Digit Blues</HD>
<DH>Investing: The telecom stocks that recently fell below $10
can bounce back, but it won't be easy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street's latest sell-off is dragging more well-known technology
and telecom shares into troubled territory: single-digit prices.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks that fall below $10 can bounce back, but it often isn't
easy, and the struggle can test the patience and fortitude of
investors.</LD>
<LD>   Numerous tech and telecom names have fallen well under $10 a share
in the latest phase of the 2-year-old market slump, which saw the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dive 7.4% last week to end at
1,663.89, the lowest since Oct. 18.</LD>
<TE>   Lucent Technologies Inc., for example, whose shares topped $70 in
late 1999, now trades at $4.65; WorldCom Group, another former
highflier, is at $3.27; Ericsson, the Swedish phone giant, fetches
just $2.43; and Qwest Communications International Inc., which traded
above $40 last spring, now is at $5.75.</TE>
<TE>   Though a company's nominal share price by itself may not provide
much help in judging the business' prospects, experts say several
forces begin to work against stocks at single-digit levels--including
investor psychology, the companies' inability to raise new equity
capital or make acquisitions using stock as currency, and limits on
institutional ownership and brokerage research coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Also, some brokerages discourage customers from buying low-priced
stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, the sheer downward momentum on already depressed
stocks can be hard to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes the market reacts to the economy and sometimes the
market reacts to the market," said Thomas Plumb, manager of the
Thompson Plumb Balanced mutual fund in Madison, Wis. "These days
people are selling a lot of stocks simply because they keep going
down. They say, 'I'd better sell it today before it goes down again
tomorrow.'"</TE>
<TE>   With a fundamental recovery in the underlying business, of course,
any stock can snap back.</TE>
<TE>   Amazon.com Inc., for instance, which traded as low as $5.51 in
October, has surged to $16.91 as the online retailer's losses have
shrunk; chip component maker Conexant Systems Inc., which fell to
$6.57 last fall, has risen to $10.14; computer services provider
Unisys Corp., which traded under $8 in September, has clawed back to
$12.33.</TE>
<TE>   However, history shows that stocks can languish in low single
digits for years once they fall to that range. And more than a few
that got there over the last two years have been wiped out in
bankruptcies.</TE>
<TE>   But for every seller there is a buyer, and some money managers say
they have eagerly scooped up stocks such as WorldCom and Qwest at
these prices. Buying low and selling high, they say, requires not
just a long-term outlook but also a strong stomach.</TE>
<TE>   One big hurdle facing single-digit stocks is the stigma of a low
share price.</TE>
<TE>   "Five bucks a share is kind of a first cut for a lot of investors
and Wall Street analysts," said Chuck Hill, research director at
earnings tracker Thomson Financial/First Call in Boston. "If the
stock is below $5 there may be a suspicion, justified or not, that
things have really tanked."</TE>
<TE>   Some institutional investors face guidelines restricting them from
buying stocks under $5. Some brokerages don't let investors buy
stocks under $5 on margin--that is, using borrowed funds for
leverage.</TE>
<TE>   Among the reasons for the restrictions on low-priced shares: They
can be extremely volatile, and lesser-known names with relatively few
shares trading can be susceptible to manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   At brokerage Edward Jones, brokers get no commission when a
customer buys a stock below $4 a share, and clients are prohibited
from purchasing shares under $1. At rival A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc.,
customers are warned of the "potential risks" associated with stocks
trading below designated levels, the firm says.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage analysts--whose "buy," "sell" and "hold" ratings still
can sway share prices even in the face of Wall Street's credibility
crisis--often drop coverage of low-priced companies, which they see
as unlikely prospects for lucrative investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   Internet business developer CMGI Inc., for example, was followed
by eight brokerage analysts when the stock traded north of $100 in
early 2000. Now, just one analyst covers the $1.24 stock.</TE>
<TE>   For many hard-hit tech and telecom companies, even if the business
improves, shell-shocked investors may be reluctant to bid up share
prices with the vigor of the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem feeds on itself. You can almost equate many of
today's telecom companies with the [crash of the] 'Nifty 50' growth
stocks of the early 1970s," said Dennis Ferro, chief investment
officer of Evergreen Funds in Charlotte, N.C. "Expecting these stocks
to return to premium valuations may be futile because it takes a long
time to rebuild your credibility with investors. Once burned,
investors won't be as generous."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the psychological factors that can keep investors away,
a low share price can have a negative fundamental effect on a
company, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   A low price inhibits a company's ability to make acquisitions that
might otherwise help the business, Ferro said, because management
doesn't have valuable shares to use as currency.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, single-digit status makes it tough to tap the
skeptical debt and equity markets with securities offerings to raise
capital, especially at a time like this--when telecom firms in
particular face a cash crunch. There also is a concern that even if a
new stock offering is completed, it might seriously dilute the
holdings of current shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a low price does not have to be permanently crippling,
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent still is a $15.9-billion company by market capitalization,
Hill noted (market cap equals share price times number of shares
outstanding). Some analysts believe the networking-equipment giant is
headed for a turnaround under its new chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom Group, meanwhile, still has $9.7 billion in market value.</TE>
<TE>   Investors with long time horizons say some of these stocks are too
much of a bargain to pass up.</TE>
<TE>   "There is tremendous value, but also tremendous risk," said John
Buckingham, manager of the Al Frank Fund in Laguna Beach. "We think
the risk/reward profile is favorable."</TE>
<TE>   Buckingham, whose fund is up 6.2% year-to-date, said he recently
has bought such stocks as WorldCom, WorldCom's MCI Group tracking
stock, Lucent, ADC Telecommunications Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp.</TE>
<TE>   He said he keeps each stake at or below a half-percentage point of
his total portfolio, however.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to have a broadly diversified portfolio of stocks
from different sectors," Buckingham said.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything can go kaput. When you buy it, you have to be prepared
for it to go to zero," he said, noting high-profile bankruptcies such
as Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd. in recent months. A record
143 publicly traded companies filed for Chapter 11 in 2001, according
to Moody's Investors Service.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Buckingham said he thinks WorldCom, which has no
significant debt maturing until 2003, will be a survivor, and he
called the stock a "worthwhile speculation."</TE>
<TE>   "It looks ugly now but if you wait for earnings visibility,
WorldCom is probably a $15 stock," Buckingham said. "That's not when
you want to be buying it. That's when I'm going to be selling it to
you."</TE>
<TE>   Plumb, whose fund is up 0.7% year-to-date, said he has been buying
shares of three telecom companies that generate "stable cash flow"
from local phone business: Qwest, SBC Communications Inc. and Verizon
Communications Inc.</TE>
<TE>   SBC and Verizon--whose shares have slumped but remain comfortably
in double digits--also pay dividends, Plumb noted.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Qwest, Plumb believes the firm's directory and
local service businesses combined are worth about $13 a share--more
than double the current share price.</TE>
<TE>   Many pros, however, have steered clear of telecom, noting the
industry's heavy debt loads and excess capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "We monitor the progress of the telecom stocks but generally we
have a 'we're from Missouri' attitude,'" Ferro said. "We want to see
management back in control of the revenue stream. We're not trying to
bet on turnarounds or pick the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Van Harte, manager of the Transamerica Premier Equity fund in
San Francisco, notes that if a company goes belly-up, holders of
common stock are likely to get wiped out while bondholders can get
paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "My advice with these imperiled companies would be: If you're
going to invest, buy the senior debt," Van Harte said. "You want to
get up the capital structure [ladder] as much as possible. In a
Chapter 11, the common shareholders are left holding the bag, and
that bag is empty."</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Online movie ticketing site Fandango.com has sued AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s rival service Moviefone, alleging that it interfered with a
ticketing deal with the Loews Cineplex theater chain in a way that
threatened the site's survival as a business.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed Thursday in Los Angeles, claims Moviefone
negotiated with Loews to abandon the theater chain's exclusive
agreement for advanced ticketing with Fandango in favor of a
competing deal with Moviefone.</LD>
<LD>   "The suit is baseless, and we plan to vigorously contest the
allegations in court," said Jim Whitney, an AOL spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   Fandango seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages, as
well as an order to prevent Moviefone from providing any ticketing
services to Loews during the term of Fandango's contract.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. Internet users looking for a star-spangled Web presence can now
sign up for domain names with a .us tag.</LD>
<LD>   Addresses in the United States' retooled Internet country code
were opened up last week to U.S. citizens and businesses after years
during which the domain was reserved primarily for local governments,
schools and libraries.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike better-known domains such as .com and .org, which fall
under the control of the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, country codes such as France's .fr and Japan's .jp are
assigned to each country to manage as they please. The United States
has until now reserved its .us domain for local governments, schools
and libraries, under a decentralized, nonprofit system that assigned
addresses based on locality.</LD>
<TE>   Washington-based NeuStar Inc., which won the right to manage the
domain in October, plans to preserve the existing system while also
opening it to commercial development.</TE>
<TE>   The privately held company also is working with the U.S.
government to set up a kids-only address that would bar violent
content, pornography or other inappropriate material. A bill that
would set up a .kids.us subdomain has cleared a House of
Representatives committee and next faces a vote in the full chamber.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Firm to Settle Domain-Name Charges</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Canadian company has agreed to pay $375,000 to settle charges that
it duped Internet domain-name holders into needlessly buying
similar-sounding names, federal regulators said.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Trade Commission said a Toronto firm doing business as
National Domain Name Registry sent unsolicited faxes to domain-name
holders claiming that an unidentified third party had applied for an
Internet domain name, such as "example.net," that was similar to the
one held by the owner, such as "example.com."</LD>
<LD>   The result could be confusion by customers and a loss of business,
the fax claimed, unless the recipient blocked the application and
bought the name for a $70 fee.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, nobody had applied for those names, the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   The company agreed to pay back $350,000 it had collected from
consumers, as well as an additional $25,000 in administrative costs,
the FTC said.</TE>
<TE>   Named as defendants in the settlement were Darren J. Morgenstern,
1268957 Ontario Inc. and 1371772 Ontario Inc., doing business as
National Domain Name Registry, Electronic Domain Name Monitoring and
Corporate Domain Name Monitoring.</TE>

<LD>After a strong showing in the U.S. video game sales charts for early
March, the fortunes of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox changed dramatically
and the console ended up barely registering in the top 20 for the
full month, according to data released last week.</LD>
<LD>   After registering six top-20 titles in the NPDFunworld report for
March 3-16, the Xbox ended up with only two top-20 games for the full
month, at Nos. 19 and 20.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft recently lowered its worldwide fiscal-year shipment
forecast for the console by as much as 40%.</LD>
<TE>   The top platform in the period was Sony Corp.'s PlayStation 2,
with nine of the top 20, including four of the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   The top-selling game in the period was Nintendo Co.'s "Super Mario

<HD>New Music Service to Allow CD Burning</HD>
<DH>Internet: Songs copied through BurnItFirst will not expire
when user's subscription ends, a unique feature.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EMI and Liquid Audio today are expected to roll out the first online
music service from a major record company that trusts consumers not
to share the music they buy with pirates.</LD>
<LD>   The service, called BurnItFirst, has two features unique among
major-label offerings online: The songs can be kept permanently, and
they all can be recorded onto a CD. Although the songs have
electronic locks to deter copying, those locks vanish as soon as the
music burns onto a disc.</LD>
<LD>   The catch is that the new service will offer songs only from EMI's
Christian music catalog, at least initially. But it offers a better
deal than most new CDs, enabling users to download 20 songs per month
for a little less than $10.</LD>
<TE>   The "unique demographic" of Christian music fans helped persuade
executives at the label to give BurnItFirst subscribers more latitude
than other services do, said Jay Samit, the company's senior vice
president of new media.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers have spoken loudly. They want to have the freedom to
burn music," Samit said. "We have no problem with that. We just want
to make sure our artists can make a living from music and are
compensated for that."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hughes, a senior vice president at EMI Christian Music
Group, said, "What we're trying to do is really provide a legal
[alternative] to stealing, to piracy. It's a real problem in the
overall music community."</TE>
<TE>   Along with a few other recent developments, the new service
suggests that the labels might be willing to take more risks to
compete with unauthorized free services on the Net.</TE>
<TE>   Music piracy has run rampant since the debut of Napster, a free
service that let users search for and copy songs from one another's
computers. Other than EMI, however, the major record companies have
been slow to support legitimate online subscription services.</TE>
<TE>   The labels also have insisted on distributing music with
electronic locks that make it difficult, if not impossible, for
consumers to move the songs out of their computers and into their
cars, living rooms and portable devices. Furthermore, the
subscription services did not allow consumers to keep playing music
after their subscriptions expired. In essence, they were renting
music.</TE>
<TE>   The one exception has been Pressplay, a joint venture of Universal
Music Group and Sony Music that lets subscribers burn 20% of the
songs they download. But only a portion of the songs in Pressplay's
catalog, which includes music from Universal, Sony and EMI, are
eligible for burning.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Smith, a vice president of marketing at Redwood City,
Calif.-based Liquid Audio, said his company was poised last year to
jump into the music-rental business. But it held off, he said,
because "we just didn't believe consumers were going to buy off on
that.... It's too big a leap for consumers to make."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he said, the company didn't want complex and
confusing rules for what subscribers could and couldn't do with the
music in their digital collections. So it sought licenses from the
major labels to offer songs that never expired, that could be burned
onto CDs and that could be downloaded as easily as the songs on the
unauthorized services.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Ryan, chief executive at Listen.com in San Francisco, agreed
that burning is a big factor in consumer acceptance. What's holding
the labels back, he said, is "the hope for a magical secure CD."</TE>
<TE>   Roxio plans to offer a premium version of its Rhapsody
music-on-demand service next month that will enable subscribers to
burn tracks from Naxos' classical music catalog. Ryan said other
labels are likely to support this approach--letting online music
subscribers burn songs onto CDs for an extra fee--although the price
and other terms are still subject to debate.</TE>
<TE>   While the major labels have been willing to let consumers rent a
hundred or more songs per month for the price of a single CD, they're
unwilling to back a high-volume, low-price approach to burning. Nor
are they willing to have online offers compete with brand new
releases--according to Hughes, new Christian titles probably will
wait 90 days before being available on BurnItFirst.</TE>
<TE>   Analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research firm, has
criticized the major labels for imposing restrictions on online music
services that make them unappealing to consumers. BurnItFirst, he
said, is "certainly a step in the right direction, and hopefully an
evolutionary step they'll follow with the rest of their catalog."</TE>
<TE>   Samit said EMI will see how consumers respond to BurnItFirst
before deciding whether to expand its offering. But what the company
really wants, he said, is a way to let consumers burn songs onto CDs
that cannot be copied.</TE>

<HD>Beyond the Slump</HD>
<DH>Cingular CEO Stephen Carter sees a continuing need for
wireless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A little more than a year ago, no one had heard of Cingular Wireless.
In fact, it didn't exist. But after cobbling together more than 11
brands nationwide--including Pacific Bell Wireless in California,
BellSouth Mobility and Cellular One--it has become the nation's
second-largest mobile phone carrier, and its quirky orange "X-man"
logo has been burned into the minds of an army of consumers.</LD>
<LD>   The company, a joint venture of SBC Communications Inc. and
BellSouth Corp., spent heavily to make its name known alongside the
newly named Verizon Wireless and longtime brands AT&amp;T Wireless,
Sprint PCS and Nextel Communications. Cingular's 21.8 million mobile
subscribers place it at No. 2, behind Verizon Wireless at 29.6
million.</LD>
<LD>   But after years of historic growth, the U.S. wireless industry no
longer is immune to the travails of its telecommunications brethren.
Wireless carriers' stock prices have fallen sharply, subscriber
growth is subsiding, and many major cities now have five or more
competitors vying for customers.</LD>
<TE>   Cingular and its rivals also are spending billions of dollars on
technology upgrades that will pay off in the short term only if
masses of people flock to new data services--a big if in this
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of industry mergers is rampant, with the most recent rumors
putting Cingular in discussions with both AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc.
and VoiceStream Wireless Corp.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the company marches on. Cingular recently filed
paperwork for its long-delayed initial public offering, and this
month it launched its always-on data service in California.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Carter, Cingular's president and chief executive, wouldn't
comment directly on the merger speculation, but he recently discussed
the range of issues concerning wireless today.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What's behind the downturn in wireless, and do you think
it will help spark consolidation?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: At the moment, the telecom sector is kind of down, and
there's a propensity to lump everyone together. But I think the
drivers of why things are down are very different for different
sectors.</TE>
<TE>   With a stand-alone long- distance company, it's very hard to see
where that goes in the long term. You pick your time frame: Two,
three, five years out, will anybody still be buying a certain
distance in telephone calls? I don't think so. I can see why there's
a downer in that area.</TE>
<TE>   When we come to wireless, though, here's a business that is
growing. Yes, the growth is tapering as maturity and penetration take
their course, but the business is growing to where pretty much
anybody that you ask--who can walk and talk--would like a cellular
phone or some sort of wireless device.</TE>
<TE>   [Companies] with strong business plans and the capability of
making a return on the investment will survive and prosper. Those
that don't, the economics are going to weed them out, and they'll
either be taken over or they'll sell to somebody or they'll go by the
wayside.</TE>
<TE>   Among the stronger players, I think it's entirely possible that
you would see some consolidation, just because as we make investments
in new- generation technology, there are incredible synergies that
could be gained.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation as to how that actually falls into place is beyond
where I can get to. But I certainly think that if you look medium
term, you'll see an environment with a smaller number of profitable
wireless companies.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How important will this summer's roll-outs be to the success of
wireless high-speed data services?</TE>
<TE>   A: I keep saying over and over that it's not going to be important
on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   We're going to look back in 12 months' or 18 months' time, and
we're going to notice this shift in the way people are doing business
or using their service.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, what's going to happen is that you're going to notice
a pretty significant increase in the [data] coverage nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers are going to notice a significant change, and
enterprises are getting more interested.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Many believe corporations will be the key to making wireless
data successful, but what about consumers?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you classify wireless data as non-voice, you shouldn't
discount the effect the consumer can have on non-voice, in more fun
or simplistic ways.</TE>
<TE>   An example might be our ring tones. In the first month that we
sold ring tones, I think we sold a few thousand. In December, 350,000
were downloaded, and that was just at Cingular. We never really
advertised that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why is short messaging service important to the industry?</TE>
<TE>   A: SMS is huge in Europe. My nieces almost never make phone calls.
But they know that for 10 pence or 5 pence, or whatever it is there,
they can send a message, and they all text-message.</TE>
<TE>   Here, we [recently] turned on the interoperability [with other
carriers]. The first morning, we turned it on more for testing than
anything else, and 100,000 messages popped over to other carriers.
The first week went by, and we were up to about a million, and it's
growing on a daily basis.</TE>
<TE>   From the point of view of Europe, that's nothing, but from the
point of view of a complete nation that's never done any of that
before, it's kind of amazing.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you think of hybrid phones, phones with Palm-like
functions built in? How popular or important will that segment be?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think that's going to be a very personal issue, and I'm sure
there are going to be strong advocates on all sides.</TE>
<TE>   One of the great things about [Cingular's Global System for Mobile
communications technology] is that we use SIM cards [that store your
account information].</TE>
<TE>   With SIM cards, you can take your identity and use it in multiple
devices. Today, I'm using a very businesslike phone with a color
display and all sorts of things. But if I'm out tonight for dinner,
if I want something more cool or lighter or smaller, I can put [the
SIM card] into a new phone.</TE>
<TE>   You'll see spots where a PDA-like device will be perfect for some
people to use during the day, and then they might want to use a
different device at night.</TE>
<TE>   There are others, and I think I'm one of them, who prefer to
separate the two. I don't believe that the hybrid is going to
dominate, but I think it will have a section or a niche in the
marketplace.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Probes Vote Tampering</HD>
<DH>Media: The firm seeks criminal charges for alleged hacking
during shareholders' vote on its stock-option plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal, the world's second-largest media company, said
Sunday it will seek criminal charges against hackers who allegedly
tampered with electronic votes at the company's shareholder assembly
last week.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi plans to convene a new meeting to allow shareholders to
vote again after suspecting fraud at Wednesday's assembly. The
company has called for a board meeting today to set a new date in
early June, Vivendi said.</LD>
<LD>   The company's stock-option plan was one of two resolutions
unexpectedly voted down at the meeting. Vivendi said it became
suspicious after an "unusual level" of abstaining votes from its
large shareholders were recorded.</LD>
<TE>   "We had been warned by several big shareholders that the results
of the votes sounded a little bit strange to them," Messier said in
an interview with Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said it polled some of these shareholders, including Cie.
Saint-Gobain, which owns 1.13% in the company, Societe Generale,
Credit Agricole and BNP Paribas. It found their votes had
systematically and wrongly been recorded as abstentions.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders at the meeting voted on 19 resolutions. They were
given electronic boxes with three switches, to vote yes, no or
abstain. Under French law, an abstention is counted as a vote against
a proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi said its "suspicion of a fraud on the votes could have
been done by a small team equipped with transmitters and who knew
well the details of procedures and technical protocols of electronic
votes."</TE>
<TE>   The company said it inspected the material used during its
assembly and found no evidence of wrongdoing. It has asked that the
material be sealed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi will transfer its dividend, about $900 million, to a
blocked bank account. The dividend must be approved during a
shareholder meeting. It was due to be paid on May 13, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Colette Neuville, a shareholder activist, said Saturday in an
interview that she will ask the Paris Court of Commerce to appoint an
expert to examine the computer hard drives storing the votes.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting, attended by about 5,000 investors in Paris' Zenith
concert hall, prompted considerable attention in the French press
after the ouster of Pierre Lescure, one of Canal Plus' founders and
its chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   It was Messier's toughest assembly since he took over the company
in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders rejected proposals to allow the board to grant
options on as many as 5% of Vivendi's shares and sell stock worth as
much as $2.7 billion.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi CEO Has Explaining to Do</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>It was a rocky week for Jean-Marie Messier, or "Master of the World,"
as the Vivendi Universal chief executive is known here. France's most
famous and controversial media mogul fended off a revolt by angry
Vivendi TV workers and emerged from a raucous meeting of shareholders
bruised but with his job intact and apparently the full support of
his board of directors.</LD>
<LD>   But Messier isn't out of the woods yet. Having survived a
potential coup in his homeland, the 45-year-old CEO faces an even
more daunting task: wooing skeptical investors and analysts on Wall
Street to his vision of fashioning a global entertainment leader out
of properties ranging from Eminem to Curious George.</LD>
<LD>   Messier seemed to acknowledge as much when he told shareholders at
the annual meeting last week that "the world at large still needs to
be convinced" that Vivendi's strategy can succeed.</LD>
<TE>   Although his challenge is clear, the solutions are not.</TE>
<TE>   There are no easy fixes to the problems--from debt reduction to
restructuring the company's struggling pay television unit--that
analysts and investors said must be addressed before the company's
languid stock can recover.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares continued to fall this week and are down 40% this
year. Vivendi's American depositary receipts on the New York Stock
Exchange declined 27 cents to $32.87 on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   A former investment banker who thrives on deal-making, Messier has
been on a buying spree during the last two years, spending more than
$50 billion in his quest to transform a 149-year-old French water
utility into one of the world's largest entertainment companies.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisitions include Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios, European
pay television and movie production company Canal Plus, U.S.
education publisher Houghton Mifflin, online music service MP3.com
and the film and television businesses of USA Networks--an
$11-billion deal was approved by USA shareholders last week.</TE>
<TE>   The mergers are aimed at making Vivendi a global leader in movies,
music and publishing and a rival to AOL Time Warner Inc. An apostle
of the convergence between new and old media, Messier also believes
that cell phones and the Internet will be key pipelines for movies,
music and games. But investors aren't sold on the vision.</TE>
<TE>   Their beef isn't that Messier has made bad choices. Universal
Music Group is the biggest player in the field and Universal Studios
is one of the top studios in Hollywood, known for such recent hits as
"The Mummy Returns" and the Oscar-winning "A Beautiful Mind." But
investors say they don't understand how all the various
businesses--including the water, sewage and telecom utilities--fit
together to form a coherent whole.</TE>
<TE>   Troubles at Other Giants Are Adding to Concern</TE>
<TE>   The struggles of other conglomerates, notably AOL Time Warner and
Tyco International Ltd., one of the world's largest industrial
companies, have only brought more skepticism toward Vivendi's complex
web of businesses. Tyco, facing a crisis in investor confidence,
scrapped plans to break itself in four parts last week. AOL Time
Warner reported a largely paper loss of $54 billion in the first
quarter as it wrote down the value of its assets.</TE>
<TE>   So Messier's biggest task in the near future is explaining his
strategy for integrating the companies and building synergies across
disparate businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to come to the market with a clear, consistent and
justified strategy," said Mark Harrington, a media analyst with J.P.
Morgan, who downgraded his rating on the Vivendi stock from "buy" to
"market perform" last week, citing concerns about the company's
strategy. "Vivendi is a very complex company, so the message has got
to be almost overly simplistic."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear, for example, what kind of synergies can be built
across such diverse businesses, Harrington said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why does it make sense to keep music and education in the same
portfolio?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   Investors said Messier hasn't clearly communicated what exactly
Vivendi is--and will be two to three years from now.</TE>
<TE>   "He sends a lot of mixed messages," said Michael Nathanson, an
analyst with Sanford Bernstein, though like other analysts, Nathanson
welcomes Messier's pledge to improve communication with analysts and
investors.</TE>
<TE>   Messier Takes Some Blame Over Confusion</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's annual meeting, Messier acknowledged having
"personally, involuntarily and clumsily contributed" to confusion
about Vivendi's corporate strategy by "trying to explain too much."</TE>
<TE>   Some aspects of the company may take more explaining.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said his strategy is to build a global media company, yet
half of Vivendi's income and revenue still come from its water and
waste utility, Vivendi Environnement.</TE>
<TE>   Messier has told analysts and company executives that he intends
to lower Vivendi's stake in Vivendi Environnement from 63% to less
than 50% while increasing the company's stake in Cegetel, the
profitable French telecommunications business. That would allow
Vivendi to lower its debt while also beefing up its image as a pure
media company, which is something analysts have been wanting.</TE>
<TE>   But at the shareholders meeting Wednesday, Messier downplayed such
plans as "not on the agenda" and a "nonissue."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts argue that Vivendi would make more sense if its
telecom, media and environment businesses were split in three.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know what the compelling story about the stock is,"
Nathanson said. "If you want a mobile phone company, you buy
Vodafone. If you want a music company, you buy EMI. What are you
buying into with Vivendi?"</TE>
<TE>   As Vivendi has bulked up, so has its debt, fueling criticism that
the company has grown too much, too fast.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi has a debt load of $26 billion, of which about $14.5
billion is from the media and communications businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Messier said reducing debt was a top priority and Vivendi would
make no "significant acquisitions" this year. In a move to reassure
investors, Vivendi earlier this month sold its professional and
health press unit, shaving its debt by $1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Selling the utility business may prove more challenging. Messier
has promised Vivendi Environnement shareholders not to sell to
another utility or sell any of the utility's shares on the stock
market. There are dicey political issues involved.</TE>
<TE>   President, Unions Warn About Selling Utility</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac and Vivendi's unions have warned
Messier not to sell the utility to foreign interests.</TE>
<TE>   And Messier, already having battled with the French establishment
over a controversial management overhaul at Canal Plus, is in no mood
for another battle with the French government.</TE>
<TE>   Messier also faces the task of turning around the division's
finances. Canal Plus is the worst-performing group in Vivendi. The
unit lost $57 million in the first quarter of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Restructuring Canal Plus, with its legal obligations to fund
French cinema, may prove difficult, as Messier already has learned
with the controversy he unleashed by sacking former Chairman Pierre
Lescure.</TE>
<TE>   Hostile market conditions make the prospect of a turnaround even
tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually all European pay-television operators are reeling from
high programming costs, mostly for sports broadcasts, and declines in
subscribers, analysts said. Earlier this month, the core business of
Germany's Kirch Group filed for bankruptcy amid huge losses at its
Premiere pay-television unit.</TE>
<TE>   The game plan for Canal Plus is just one of the topics that will
be on the table next month, when Messier makes his case to analysts
during a meeting hosted by Vivendi in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington is reserving judgment until then.</TE>
<TE>   "The past two weeks has put Messier in the hot seat," Harrington
said. "I don't think he's had the ability to relax and step back and
think about what just happened. Then he can determine what he needs
to do and the best way to communicate that to the market."</TE>

<LD>Some headaches may be linked to infection by a common bug, and daily
doses of friendly bacteria could ward them off, preliminary research
suggests.</LD>
<LD>   A study presented April 26 at the Milan infectious diseases
conference found that about 18% of chronic migraine sufferers were
infected with the stomach bug Helicobacter pylori and that
antibiotics appeared to clear the headaches.</LD>
<LD>   Adding the friendly bacteria Lactobacillus seemed to work even
better, leaving most people migraine-free for a year and lessening
the intensity and frequency of recurring headaches in the others, the
lead researcher said.</LD>
<TE>   H. pylori, the bug that causes gut ulcers, has been linked to a
growing list of diseases, including heart disease, autoimmune
diseases and skin conditions.</TE>

<LD>Sudden infant death syndrome may be linked to an infection caused by
a common intestinal bacterium called Escherichia coli, preliminary
research suggests.</LD>
<LD>   Australian researchers told a Milan conference on infectious
diseases April 25 that a shock-producing byproduct of E. coli was
found in the blood of 68 SIDS babies tested, but in none of the 60
infants used for comparison.</LD>
<LD>   The toxin that the Australian researchers suspect is a protein
called curlin. Scientists suspect the bacteria may produce the toxin
to help it compete in the germ environment in the intestines.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Scientists at the University of Georgia report that they have cloned
a calf from a piece of meat. En route to the supermarket, the side of
fresh beef was sampled for cells from the kidney area, and the cells
supplied genes from which a calf was cloned. It was born April 22 at
the university in Athens.</LD>
<LD>   The cloners--biologist Steve Stice and colleagues at the
university and at a biotechnology company, ProLinia Inc.--touted the
value of cloning for the meat industry. After much more research and
pending government approval, it one day may enable them to identify,
and then re-create, animals to supply the best meats.</LD>
<LD>   Critics said using fresh meat as the source of genetic material is
no different from using a biopsied sample from a live animal.</LD>

<HD>Oldest Fossil of Placental Mammal Is Discovered</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was about six inches long from head to tail, a furry, shrew-like
tree-climber that ate insects and maybe worms, and probably hid out
during the day to stay away from marauding dinosaurs.</LD>
<LD>   This small creature lived 125 million years ago in northeast
China. It is the oldest fossil of a placental mammal yet discovered.
Scientists from Pittsburgh's Carnegie Museum of Natural History who
made the find have dubbed the creature Eomaia scansoria, or "climbing
dawn mother."</LD>
<LD>   "This is a time period where we had not found any mammals at all,"
said paleontologist John R. Wible, who led the Chinese/American team.
"Until now, the oldest we had lived 115 million years ago, and all
there was were jaws or teeth. This is an almost intact skeleton in
articulation."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Q: Why do golf balls have dimples?</LD>
<LD>   A: Their purpose is to reduce air resistance, and thus help the
balls fly longer distances.</LD>
<LD>   A well-hit golf ball leaves the tee at a speed of about 120 mph.</LD>
<TE>   At that speed, a spinning ball with a smooth surface has a thick
layer of air around it, called a boundary layer. That air, in effect,
makes the ball bigger, increasing resistance and slowing the ball.</TE>
<TE>   The dimples increase turbulence in the boundary layer, reducing
its size and making the ball travel faster and farther.</TE>

<HD>Physicist Lived for Beethoven, Quantum Mechanics</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some people have such a presence that their sudden absence leaves a
palpable hole in the universe.</LD>
<LD>   So it is with the death last week of Viki Weisskopf of MIT--not
merely a great physicist, but a man colleagues referred to as
everything from "the conscience of the physics community" to "the
ultimate civilized man."</LD>
<LD>   Viki played chamber music with Einstein ("I've played with
better," he said, "but he was very enthusiastic.") He taught quantum
mechanics to Pope John Paul II, and loved the idea that a Viennese
Jew would advise the pontiff. (They worked together on disarmament
issues.) At Europe's CERN particle accelerator, where he brought
about the first truly international physics lab, he was known as "the
Grey Eminence."</LD>
<TE>   To a novice stumbling through the confusing maze of modern
physics, he was a steady comfort, an eager guide. I was introduced to
Victor Weisskopf through his book "Knowledge and Wonder," the only
book other than "The Exorcist" that I ever stayed up all night to
read. Early on, I borrowed his example of how an extra lousy little
electron changes the nonreactive gas neon into the highly reactive
metal sodium. A fact-checker at Discover magazine objected that the
example I used wasn't technically correct because sodium also has an
extra proton.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked Viki about it, he said: "You always have to lie a
little to tell the truth." Years later, when I confessed to feeling
guilty because I stole so many of his ideas, he said: "The only sin
is if you hear a good idea and you don't steal it."</TE>
<TE>   Wrong ideas, he often said, were as important in their own ways as
right ones. He told me the story of an impatient German tourist who
asked why the Austrians bothered to publish train schedules when the
trains were never on time. "If we didn't have timetables," the
conductor answered, "we wouldn't be able to tell how late we are."</TE>
<TE>   When I was frustrated trying to understand gravity as the
curvature of space-time, Viki told me he often felt the same way. He
shared the story of the peasant who asked the engineer how a steam
engine works. The engineer gave a detailed explanation, drawing
diagrams, showing where the fuel goes in, how heat is transformed
into motion and so forth. When the engineer was done, the peasant
said he understood perfectly. Just one question, the peasant added:
"Where is the horse?"</TE>
<TE>   Viki said that's how he still felt about Einstein's theory of
gravity. "I understand it perfectly. But I don't know where the horse
is." He said the theory of relativity should be called the "theory of
absolutism," and helped me see that Einstein's genius came from his
insight into the unvarying nature of fundamental law. "Relativity
says that the laws of nature are absolute and do not depend on the
motion of the system," Viki said. "The only things that become
relative are old-fashioned concepts like space and time."</TE>
<TE>   He renamed the notorious "uncertainty principle" the "definiteness
principle," and passionately defended quantum mechanics against
charges that it somehow implied nature was not concrete. On the
contrary, he explained, quantum mechanics showed why atoms had only a
few stable configurations, like musical chords. All the regularities
of nature spring from this astonishing fact--the permanence of genes
through generations, the sameness of gold atoms everywhere in the
cosmos, the fact that the same flowers bloom again every spring.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, he loved the principle of complementarity, developed by
his mentor, Niels Bohr, the Danish physicist. Complementary truths
are seemingly irreconcilable opposites that are both required for
deep understanding. "We cannot at the same time experience the
artistic content of a Beethoven sonata and also worry about the
neurophysiological processes in our brains," he said. "But we can
shift from one to another."</TE>
<TE>   He told a story about a conversation that took place between Nobel
laureates Felix Bloch and Werner Heisenberg during a walk on the
beach. Bloch was expounding to Heisenberg some new theories about the
mathematical structure of space. Heisenberg responded: "Space is
blue, and birds fly in it."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever one way of thinking dominated, Viki warned, it spelled
disaster for society--whether it was the dominance of religion in the
Middle Ages or the dominance of technology today.</TE>
<TE>   He liked to say he lived for Beethoven and quantum mechanics.
"What's beautiful in science is the same thing that's beautiful in
Beethoven," he once told me. "It connects things that were always in
you that were never put together before....There's a scientific truth
and an emotional truth. If you are completely immersed in one, many
important aspects of life are missed."</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for me and everyone who knew him, Viki didn't miss a
thing.</TE>

<HD>Weather Forecast: Wait</HD>
<DH>Scientists say we are due for the global effect known as El
Nino, but no one can say when one is coming or how strong it will be.</DH>

<LD>Will it be an El Nino? Or an El No Show?</LD>
<LD>   The country's top weather predictors--scientists at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration--have said since February that
an El Nino is on the way. But they can't say when it will arrive or
how strong it will be.</LD>
<LD>   Longer-range experimental forecasts that attempt to predict El
Ninos up to one year in advance disagree on what's ahead. And some of
those who closely monitor ocean temperatures say there's not much to
report from the tropical Pacific waters that spawn the global weather
phenomenon.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not happening yet," said Bill Patzert, an oceanographer at
JPL. "It could be an El No Show."</TE>
<TE>   El Nino is a temporary disruption in the waters of the tropical
Pacific and the atmosphere above it that can alter weather patterns
around the world. The massive El Nino of 1997-1998 brought torrential
rains to California and drought to Indonesia and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Because of these widespread effects, scientists and government
officials are anxious to predict the phenomenon well in advance. Many
groups--from energy traders to roofers--await any El Nino news.</TE>
<TE>   Phenomenon Is Linked to Ocean Temperatures</TE>
<TE>   It is about time for an El Nino. They generally occur every three
to seven years. But forecasting long-term weather and climate
patterns is never an easy game. This year is turning out to be more
challenging than usual.</TE>
<TE>   El Ninos are closely linked to ocean temperatures and tropical
trade winds.</TE>
<TE>   Warm water generally pools in the western Pacific because trade
winds blow from east to west. Every few years, a brief period of
weakening trade winds or warming ocean temperatures in the eastern
Pacific leads to a yearlong period of warm temperatures in the
eastern part of the ocean and weak tropical trade winds.</TE>
<TE>   These interactions, a natural positive feedback loop, crank up to
produce an El Nino or its cold, windy cousin, La Nina. Both patterns
influence the atmosphere and can disrupt weather around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   The El Nino of 1997-1998 was much easier to get a handle on. Huge
pools of warm water quickly spread across the ocean and then warmed
the atmosphere. "You saw it coming, then it hit," said Wayne Higgins,
a lead El Nino forecaster at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center. "This
year, the evolution has been really slow. We're being very cautious."</TE>
<TE>   Higgins said there was about a 70% chance an El Nino would
develop. He was unable to say how weak or strong it might be, but
said that it would be unusual to have another strong event after the
El Nino of 1997-1998. Major El Nino events occur every two to three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look in the historical record, you don't find
back-to-back El Ninos," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Mantua, an atmospheric scientist at the University of
Washington who monitors conditions in the tropical Pacific, said he
sees what looks like weak El Nino conditions developing.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if this cranked up into a major event," he said.
"It might be among the weakest El Ninos we can classify."</TE>
<TE>   Surges of warm water similar to those seen in 1997-1998 have been
reported by South American fishermen, and they have coincided with
major changes in coastal fisheries and regional flooding in Peru and
Ecuador. But these "coastal El Ninos," Mantua said, are not always
linked to the larger-scale atmospheric changes that yield global El
Nino events.</TE>
<TE>   While talk of El Nino often prompts fears of massive floods and
houses tumbling down rain-soaked cliffs, the net effect of the wet
and warm El Nino generally is considered positive for the United
States. Because of lowered winter heating bills in the northern parts
of the country and fewer Atlantic hurricanes, the weather pattern
results in savings estimated to be billions of dollars and hundreds
of lives.</TE>
<TE>   Weak El Nino Could Be Bad News for California</TE>
<TE>   In California, the lack of a strong El Nino may actually be bad
news. The state has been drier than average for the last four years,
and a weak El Nino is unlikely to change that. "People shouldn't dis
El Nino," Patzert said. (The current drought on the East Coast is not
thought to be linked to El Nino or to the drier La Nina pattern.)</TE>
<TE>   Several groups are trying to predict El Nino events six months to
a year in advance, using models of how the oceans and atmosphere
behave.</TE>
<TE>   A group at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography is predicting a
mild El Nino for the coming winter and next spring, said David
Pierce, an analyst at the Climate Research division at Scripps.</TE>
<TE>   But the forecasts of various groups using different ocean and
atmosphere models do not agree as well as they did in 1997-1998.
"It's been a little uncertain this year," Pierce said. "This time
around, I guess we'll find out which models are better."</TE>
<TE>   Forecasting El Nino remains a challenge. Some aspects of the
system--like the slow-moving waves that carry heat across the
ocean--can be predicted. But other aspects, like small-scale weather
patterns, remain random. "We don't know how much will ultimately be
predictable," Pierce said.</TE>
<TE>   The fickle trade winds add to the difficulty. When they stop, or
reverse, they allow massive shifts in the distribution of warm water
in the Pacific. They can change from week to week.</TE>
<TE>   An early indication that an El Nino event may be developing came
in January, after the trade winds relaxed for 10 days and allowed
waters to warm by 4 degrees to 6 degrees off the South American
coast. But the winds soon returned to normal; the water then cooled
to just 2 degrees to 4 degrees above normal, NOAA's Higgins said.</TE>
<TE>   "No one really knows the timing of these big relaxations of trade
winds, which really are the key," said Patzert, who helps monitor the
winds at JPL using an orbiting microwave radar called SeaWinds.</TE>
<TE>   NOAA's Higgins said his group would have a better indication about
the current El Nino pattern by May or June, when there are fewer
weather vagaries than in spring.</TE>
<TE>   That should still be plenty of warning, since the effects of El
Nino on the Northern Hemisphere would not hit until next winter.</TE>
<TE>   "People should just calm down," Patzert said. "If it does happen,
our satellites will definitely give us a heads up and tell us how
strong it is."</TE>

<HD>Oversee the Power to the People</HD>
<DH>Deregulation has exposed residential consumers to price
volatility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL AHERN and MICHAEL McCAULEY</AU>
<BD>Bill Ahern is an energy analyst and Michael McCauley
is the media director for the West Coast regional office of Consumers
Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California faces a series of critical decisions this year on how best
to reconfigure its electricity market now that the state's experiment
with deregulation has resulted in disaster for consumers. Industry
groups are pushing for full development of truly competitive retail
and wholesale power markets. Some consumer and labor groups are
advocating a return to utility franchises and cost-of-service
regulation.</LD>
<LD>   There is a middle ground: Protect residential consumers and small
businesses and let large industrial electricity users, who were the
driving force behind deregulation in the first place, navigate
competitive markets.</LD>
<LD>   California's attempt to restructure its electricity market was a
disaster. Consumers were promised lower electricity rates and the
opportunity to choose their own energy provider in a competitive
marketplace. They got neither.</LD>
<TE>   According to the California Public Utilities Commission, 2% of
residential customers chose alternative providers. And when wholesale
rates went through the roof last year and the rate freeze suddenly
turned out to be a bad deal for the utilities, the state was forced
to begin purchasing power. Consumers were socked with an average 40%
rate hike.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever happened to lower rates and the magic of the competitive
marketplace? Retail competition simply failed to materialize in
California, and there is little evidence from other states that
deregulated their electricity markets that energy providers are
clamoring to serve individual consumers. Consumers are ill-equipped
to evaluate complicated pricing information on electricity choices,
especially when they are forced to rely on questionable marketing
materials offered by energy providers.</TE>
<TE>   Given the volatility of the market and the essential nature of
this commodity, residential consumers and small businesses would be
better served by a return to electricity service more strictly
overseen by the PUC. Under PUC regulation, the state's utilities
should offer consumers a standard service constructed from a mix of
short- and long-term power supplies that provides stability and
reliability.</TE>
<TE>   The retail power rates should be based on the cost of supply to
the utility. Under this plan, the utilities would use their own power
generation sources and obtain any additional supplies they needed
through competitive bidding overseen by the PUC. The utilities would
be required to maintain a 15% energy reserve to avoid emergency
shortages and blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   Also, utilities could offer choices for consumers who wanted such
things as environmentally friendly resources by using a bidding
process to select the providers of these alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   Large businesses, on the other hand, can protect themselves and
should have the option of buying power in an unregulated marketplace
as long as the remaining utility customers are not unfairly burdened
as a result.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the PUC voted to give businesses that signed
contracts before Sept. 20, 2002, direct access to a range of energy
providers. But the agency still needs to make sure that businesses
that pursue direct access pay off their share of the state's
short-term power purchases from last year and long-term energy
contracts. These businesses should shoulder a significant part of the
ratepayer costs associated with PG&amp;E's bankruptcy and the PUC's
bailout of Southern California Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Deregulation has exposed small consumers to price volatility and
the boom-and-bust cycles of the market without providing the benefits
promised by its proponents. Let's scrap California's misguided
attempt to deregulate the electricity market and give consumers the
protection they need to enjoy an affordable, reliable power supply.</TE>

<AU>ALEXANDER COCKBURN</AU>
<BD>Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other
publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Late in the evening in back-road America you tend to pick the motels
with cars parked in front. There's nothing less appealing than an
empty courtyard, with maybe Norman Bates waiting to greet you in the
office. The all-night clerk at the Lincoln Motel (three cars out
front) in Austin, Nev., who checked me in at 11:30 a few nights ago
told me she was 81 and working two part-time jobs to help pay her
heating bills because she couldn't make it on Social Security.</LD>
<LD>   She imparted this information without self-pity, saying that
business last fall had been brisk. The 57 motel beds available in the
old mining town had been filled with crews laying fiber-optic cable,
which in the case of Austin meant putting it 20 feet under the
graveyard.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier that day, driving from Utah through the Great Basin along
U.S. 50, billed as "the loneliest road," I'd seen these cables
sticking out of the ground on the outskirts of Ely.</LD>
<TE>   So we can run fiber-optic cable through the Western deserts but
not put enough money in the hands of 81-year-olds so they don't have
to pull all-night shifts clerking in motels. What else is new?</TE>
<TE>   People who drive or lecture their way through the American
interior usually notice that you can have rational conversations with
people about the Middle East, about George W. Bush and other topics
certain to arouse unreasoning passion among sophisticates on either
coast.</TE>
<TE>   Newsman and commentator Robert Fisk describes this experience in a
recent piece for the Independent in Britain. Fisk claims on the basis
of a sympathetic hearing for his Mideast analyses--unsparing of Ariel
Sharon's current rampages--on campuses in Iowa and elsewhere in the
Midwest that things are changing in Middle America.</TE>
<TE>   After 25 years of zigzagging my way across the States I can't say
I agree. It's always been like that. Even though polls purport to
establish that 90% of Middle Americans claim to have had personal
exchanges with Jesus and reckon George W. to be the reincarnation of
Abe Lincoln, the reality is otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   Some attitudes do change. White people are more afraid of cops
than they used to be. A good old boy in South Carolina, whom I've
known for a quarter of a century, was a proud special constable in
the early 1980s. These days if a police cruiser passes him, he'll
turn off at the next intersection. The reason? A few years ago a
couple of state cops stopped him late at night, frisked him and
accused him of being drunk.</TE>
<TE>   This profoundly religious Baptist told them truthfully he'd never
consumed alcohol in his life. Then they said he must be a drug
dealer. He reckons the only reason they didn't plant cocaine in his
car was that he told them to check him out with the local police
chief, an old friend.</TE>
<TE>   I know from the stats that a lot of Americans are poor. So why am
I often the only fellow on the road or in town in an old car, aside
from some of the Mexican field workers in California for whom such
cars are home? Most everyone seems to be in a late-model pickup or a
nice new Honda Civic. I know, I know. The poor are out there, lots of
them, but the whole place just doesn't seem to feel as poor as it
often did in the early '90s in the Senior Bush recession. You could
drive through towns that felt like graveyards, with no prospect of
fiber-optic cable running under them.</TE>
<TE>   Take Grants on Interstate 40 in New Mexico, which became the
nation's self-proclaimed "uranium capital" in the 1950s after Paddy
Martinez heard descriptions of what uranium ore looked like and led
the mining prospectors to the yellow rocks he'd been looking at
through the years. The mines closed and I recall from the early 1980s
Grants looking sadly becalmed, with its Uranium Cafe and souvenir
motels from the great days of Route 66.</TE>
<TE>   Well, nostalgia is still strong in Grants, but aside from the Lee
Ranch coal mine, the juice in Grants' economy now comes in large part
from three prisons, one federal, one state and one private.</TE>
<TE>   As I was driving through Lake Valley in eastern Nevada along
Highway 93, listening to the radio, I thought, "Why not relocate the
whole West Bank to this bit of Nevada where the Palestinians could
have their state at last, financed by a modest tax on the gambling
industry." The spaces are so vast you wouldn't even need a fence.
Then reality returned in the form of the usual sign heralding a
prison 'round the next bend.</TE>
<TE>   West along U.S. 50 from Austin, I came to Grimes' Point, the site
of fine petroglyphs. A sign informed me that "the act of making a
petroglyph was a ritual performed by a group leader. Evidence
suggests that there existed a powerful taboo against doodling."</TE>
<TE>   Some things never change. On the other hand, they do.</TE>

<HD>State Should Pay Its Debt to Our Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAY HIGUCHI, ROY ROMER and CAPRICE YOUNG</AU>
<BD>Day Higuchi is the president of United Teachers-Los
Angeles. Roy Romer is the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified
School District. Caprice Young is the president of the LAUSD Board of
Education.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three of us may not agree on everything, but there is one issue
on which we are all in alignment: The state, which ranks dead last in
K-12 school funding nationally as a percentage of wealth per person,
needs to live up to its education funding commitments. It now owes
the Los Angeles school district more than $500 million in arrears and
$100 million in constitutionally mandated funds.</LD>
<LD>   A lot of attention has been focused on the Los Angeles Unified
School District as it struggles to close a budget gap of more than
$425 million. The shortfall is $500 million-plus, if you include at
least reasonable cost-of-living adjustments for school faculty and
staff.</LD>
<LD>   Extraordinarily difficult decisions are on the table. They include
the following: increasing class size from 38 to more than 40 students
in the fourth through the 12th grades; reducing the number of
counselors and nurses; cutting library hours by half; postponing
long-needed computer systems that would reduce the paperwork load on
school principals; putting off restoration of arts programs; cutting
back building maintenance and after-school programs and more.</LD>
<TE>   These changes would be devastating, especially when we are just
beginning to make major gains. Test scores are going up, technology
now reaches nearly every classroom, arts programs have begun to be
restored, teachers' salaries have risen and, for the first time in 30
years, we are successfully building and opening new schools.</TE>
<TE>   But so much more needs to be done. The services that support
schools must be made more efficient, middle and high school programs
need to be improved to address a serious achievement gap, teacher and
staff salaries must be kept competitive, parent programs should be
expanded, new principals must be recruited and trained to lead the 85
new schools opening by 2007 and after-school programs must be
expanded to all school sites.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1978, when Proposition 13 passed, more than 90% of the
school funding has come from or through the state. During fiscal year
2001-2002, the state slashed the education budget midyear by $845
million, with Los Angeles taking the hardest hit.</TE>
<TE>   Now the state legislative analyst is projecting the state
2002-2003 budget deficit to be more than $20 billion.</TE>
<TE>   We understand that asking for money for education can seem like
asking for water from a stone, but it is reasonable for the Los
Angeles schools to receive what has been promised by the state and
what is required in the California Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   The state has accumulated more than $509 million in unpaid debts
to the Los Angeles schools during the last five years. This money is
owed to the school district to pay for state mandates related to
special education and school overcrowding.</TE>
<TE>   The state should pay up. That alone would solve this year's school
district budget crisis and allow the district to set aside a small
reserve for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the state needs to live up to the state constitutional
requirement to keep the education budget whole on a year-to-year
basis. That's $800 million statewide that would help not only Los
Angeles students (to the tune of nearly $100 million) but all of the
state's school districts, every one of which is facing the same dire
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, and most important, when the voters gave the power of the
education purse to the state 30 years ago, a profound responsibility
went with it. The state needs to live up to the challenge of
adequately funding California's education system.</TE>

and are more likely than their husbands' earnings to go toward
improving the nutrition, housing and education of their children.</TE>
<TE>   This type of bottom-up approach is essential for meeting the
immediate needs of families whose lives are devastated by poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Take Khursheed Baji, a widow living in a poor area of Pakistan.
Three years ago her husband died, and her eight-member family could
barely meet its daily needs through her sons' meager income from
factory labor. With a loan of about $70 from Kashf Foundation, a
nonprofit organization providing microcredit services in Lahore, Baji
was able to open a tiny, home-based business selling sweets and other
small items to children in her community.</TE>
<TE>   With the remainder of her loan, she purchased a sewing machine for
making doll clothes and stitching embroidery.</TE>
<TE>   She earns a 30% profit from her sweets shop, and orders continue
to flow in for her sewing business. Now, even when times are tough,
she says, there is never the worry of going hungry.</TE>
<TE>   Microcredit programs often provide a variety of nonfinancial
services as well, such as basic business training and the opportunity
for women to gather together for mutual support.</TE>
<TE>   The simple act of meeting with other women once a week for loan
repayment and sharing of experiences begins the process of developing
confidence and skills to move out of the trap of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, where women have been all but shut out of the
public arena, the need to include women in development, particularly
the very poorest women, should be obvious.</TE>
<TE>   What may not be as obvious is the impact that the empowerment of
women can have on entire societies.</TE>
<TE>   Empowered women are more likely to seek medical attention for
their ill children, to participate in local government and to send
their daughters to school.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, a World Bank study on the Grameen Bank, which has been
providing microcredit services in Bangladesh since the 1970s, found
that in a typical year 5% of their borrowers (or 125,000 families)
rise above the poverty line.</TE>
<TE>   Another important finding of the study shows that for every 1%
increase in borrowing by a female Grameen member, the probability of
her daughter enrolling in school was increased by 1.9%. An increase
in borrowing by male members had no significant impact on their
daughters' schooling.</TE>
<TE>   From 1997 to 2000, the number of very poor microcredit clients
worldwide has grown from 7.6 million to 19.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Women microcredit clients report feeling more prosperous and more
hopeful about their lives and the lives of their children and better
able to deal with crises that may arise.</TE>
<TE>   This is the sort of hope and steady progress toward a better
future that fosters peace, freedom and stability.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about throwing good money after bad. Five years ago, Congress
appropriated $250 million to teach teenagers about sex. But the money
could be spent only to teach them to say no. A study released last
week found that this federal gag rule on realistic sex education may
be doing nothing to cut teenage pregnancies.</LD>
<LD>   That means young women's lives needlessly stunted by motherhood or
the trauma of abortion or even HIV, young men not learning to be
equally responsible for preventing pregnancy--and disease. And more
children raised by single parents.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, a House committee voted last week to renew the
program for another five years. Amendments that would have allowed
states to decide whether to include information about birth control
methods as well were rejected. As the kids say, how dumb is this?</LD>
<TE>   Many parents would prefer not to think of their teenagers as
sexually active. But wishing that they stay chaste won't make them
so.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are split over how to protect teenagers. Some believe
that teens should be encouraged to postpone sexual relations but also
should be taught about birth control and how to prevent diseases,
including HIV. Others say that's a confusing message--like telling
teens not to smoke, but if they do anyway to smoke filtered
cigarettes. They argue that the only thing teens should be taught
about sex is not to have it.</TE>
<TE>   This argument has carried Congress since 1996, when, as part of
the original welfare reform bill, the legislators appropriated money
for school-based sex education. To receive funds, states had to agree
to teach that abstinence "outside of marriage [is] the expected
standard" and that sexual activity outside of marriage may have
harmful effects. So, for example, health teachers can warn teens that
condoms may break but not that condoms can help prevent pregnancy.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from being disingenuous, there's no reliable evidence that
this straitjacket is helping to reduce teen sex or even is
responsible for a mild drop in teen pregnancies over the last decade.
That was the conclusion of the new study, a preliminary independent
evaluation of the federal sex education program contracted by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. California has long
refused this federal money, preferring to teach teenagers about
abstinence and birth control.</TE>
<TE>   The full House will take up the abstinence-only renewal in coming
months. Maybe this time House members will recall their own heated
adolescent urges and support a more realistic set of guidelines for
sex education.</TE>

<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Small investors raked by the Enron collapse are still licking their
wounds, and here comes Wall Street with more scandal--investment
companies accused of giving misleading advice to investors in order
to bolster their own portfolios. Investor confidence can't be
restored without regulatory reform. As made clear by the Enron case,
that must include assurance that auditors will be honest watchdogs of
corporate finance.</LD>
<LD>   Legislation passed by the House Wednesday does not go far enough,
but the Democratic-led Senate should resist the temptation to respond
with virtuous legislation that has no chance of becoming law. Unless
there is a reasonable compromise, nothing will get passed in this
election year, and the next round of abuses will brew unseen.</LD>
<TE>   The auditing industry has succeeded so far in muffling new
regulations. No wonder; the nonpartisan Center on Responsive Politics
reports that in 2000 the industry shelled out $12.3 million in
lobbying fees and $14.7 million in campaign contributions. The
industry is sponsoring a nationwide advertising campaign to resist
reform, even though Enron's sudden collapse showed in gruesome detail
the conflicts of interest that plague accounting firms. The
accounting firm Andersen, accused of helping to conceal Enron's
financial woes, earned $52 million in consulting fees in 2000 from
Enron that had nothing to do with auditing. Probes into Merrill Lynch
and Citigroup over their stock analysts' recommendations may well
uncover other auditing abuses.</TE>
<TE>   What's needed is not a cosmetic tuck but major surgery. The
GOP-backed House legislation, which President Bush has endorsed, is
only a start. It would create a board under Securities and Exchange
Commission oversight and force companies to disclose transactions
that did not appear on balance sheets, but it would not directly
attack accounting abuses.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats want to prohibit accountants from carrying out
consulting work for auditing clients, a step that is critical to
reform. Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), the Banking Committee
chairman, would provide a new board more power to investigate
auditing companies. Democrats hope to ban stock analysts from trading
in companies that they tout to investors, and, in a related measure,
Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) is sponsoring a bill that would
increase criminal penalties for security fraud and require auditing
companies to retain all documents for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Where Democrats are likely to have to make concessions is on the
power of a new auditing board. In any case, the board's effectiveness
comes down to the willingness of SEC Chairman Harvey L. Pitt to use
new regulations to police the industry aggressively.</TE>
<TE>   None of this will matter if no reforms are passed. House
Democratic Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt has already made it
clear he will use the flawed GOP bill as an election-year club to
bash Republicans as corporate lackeys. He should first seek an honest
compromise. As with campaign finance reform, Enron created an
opportunity. Shame on lawmakers if they don't seize it.</TE>

<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp.'s hostile bid to acquire TRW Corp. eventually
will sort itself out. If not Northrop, some other giant defense
contractor will probably gobble up TRW, which holds fast to its hope
of selling divisions, reducing debt and staying independent. No
matter how the story plays out, Northrop's run at TRW underscores the
revival of cutting-edge space and defense research and manufacturing
in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   A successful acquisition of TRW would complete Los Angeles-based
Northrop's unlikely transformation from bit player in the aerospace
industry to one of the country's largest defense contractors. It
would also bode well for the local economy.</LD>
<LD>   Merged companies don't need two corporate headquarters, so some
lucky northern Ohioans would throw down their snow shovels and join
300 executives and corporate staffers at Northrop's Century City
headquarters. It's a good thing for the economy when moving vans
stuffed with StairMasters and big-screen televisions are heading into
town.</LD>
<TE>   TRW's reorganization plan is designed to keep Northrop away, but
it also shows where TRW believes it can grow. TRW would sell its
debt-laden automotive parts business and spin off a business that
manufactures aircraft parts. That leaves El Segundo-based aerospace
and defense, the division that Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los
Angeles County Economic Development Corp., describes as TRW's "crown
jewel."</TE>
<TE>   Northrop has 12,000 employees scattered from San Diego to
Palmdale, working on such key defense projects as the B-2 bomber, the
Joint Strike Fighter and the unmanned Global Hawk reconnaissance
aircraft. Northrop could solidify its status as a major local
employer by adopting all 10,000 TRW employees in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's TRW bid is part of a continuing defense industry
consolidation that has produced such giants as Boeing, Lockheed
Martin Aeronautics Co. and Raytheon Corp. The big fish got that way
by swallowing smaller competitors and eliminating duplicate
divisions--often at the acquired company's expense. TRW's space and
electronics operation wouldn't feel such pain because, as Kyser
notes, "the talent base is here in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's bright lights tend to blind Angelenos to the economic
importance of the defense industry. California lost as many as
300,000 jobs in the 1990s as the state's share of national defense
contracts dwindled from 20% to 15%. At stake now are 21st century
defense contracting jobs linked to some of the military's growing
space-based and high-tech battlefield initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop and TRW are a good fit. Given the antitrust scrutiny that
other potential buyers would attract, it's unlikely TRW would come
across a better suitor.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I disagree with Marte Amato's assertion that labeling French
presidential candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen an "extremist" while not
also calling Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin an "extremist" is
a sign of The Times' bias (letter, April 25). Whereas in the U.S. a
Socialist running for president may be called extremist, Europeans
have had and continue to have Socialist rulers. However, with his
notorious remarks about the Holocaust, AIDS sufferers, immigrants and
other groups, Le Pen has shown that he is outside of mainstream
France.</LD>
<LD>   Before Le Pen's surprise advancement to the second round, most
people expected a rehash of 1995's presidential elections, which
Jospin lost narrowly. Now, if instant polls are to be believed,
Jacques Chirac could win by the greatest landslide ever.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Saudi Prince Warns Bush to Rein In Israel," April 26: It's
unfortunate that President Bush entertained that Saudi bandit at his
ranch in Texas. He should have had Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia escorted back to his plane with instructions to beat it back
to his sand pit. I don't think the Saudis have any moral or other
ground to stand on when it comes to events in the Middle East;
there's too much blood and dirty dealing on their hands to allow them
any credibility.</LD>
<LD>   Many people I know agree with me that we should pull all our
military and other people out of Saudi Arabia immediately and let the
Saudis fend for themselves. All we are really doing there is propping
up a corrupt dictatorship little better than that in Iraq. The way
they have mutated the Muslim religion to suit themselves is bad
enough, but the way they treat their own people, particularly their
women, is shameful. The result of their involvement with the
Palestinians over the past 50 years is sinful.</LD>
<LD>   We no longer need Saudi oil; there is plenty available in other
places. Let them try to irrigate the desert with their sudden
petroleum surplus.</LD>
<TE>   Joe Doremire</TE>
<TE>   Bakersfield</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah had better get his priorities in line before lecturing
the U.S. about how to conduct foreign policy. When Saudi Arabia (and
all the other Islamic states) abandon the sanctioning of
indiscriminate mass murder as state policy they can lecture the U.S.
on Israel (or anything). Maybe the next time Saddam Hussein gets
feisty, Abdullah may find himself without a state to set policy for.</TE>
<TE>   Paul J. Burke</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If President Bush had the guts of former New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, he would have told the Saudi prince that Israel is
defending itself against terrorism, specifically targets terrorist
forces and desires true peace more than any other nation in the
region. There is no need to rein in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, he would have told his highness, in an echo of
Giuliani's statements to another member of the royal family, that his
highness' thinking is exactly the mind-set that leads to events like
Sept. 11. Giuliani sent back a check; Bush should ship back barrels
of oil. He should also add a note inquiring as to why medieval
monarchies are still tolerated in the 21st century.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Broaden U.N. Jenin Inquiry to Include Palestinians,"
Commentary, April 25: Walter Reich's suggestion of broadening the
U.N.'s Jenin inquiry must be commended. However, the investigation
should not only include the alleged role of the Palestinian Authority
in the suicide bombings that killed Israeli civilians but also the
role of Israel's military in the killing of hundreds of defenseless
Palestinian civilians since September 2000, including over 200
children.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying out such a "parallel investigation" could indeed lead to
peace, but only when Arab and Jewish lives are treated with equal
respect and thoughtfulness.</TE>

<TE>   Cairo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Israelis have uncovered hard evidence linking Yasser Arafat
and some of his closest advisors to the terrorist suicide bombings.
Why are so many Europeans and leftists dismissive of hard evidence
connecting the Palestinian leadership to terrorism while they
unceasingly report unverified "massacres" in which there is no
supporting evidence? Could they have become "terrorist rights
activists" instead of human rights activists?</TE>

and the private sector, Matt Miller said, in part, "Conservatively,
we're closing in on $1 million a year. Now let's be clear: There is
nothing wrong with this'' ("Hughes Has It All--and More,''
Commentary, April 25). Nothing wrong? While it is true that there is
nothing illegal about the speaking fees and directorships he
outlined, "wrong" is another matter altogether. At its core, this is
just another form of influence-peddling.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes will not be asked to speak because of her charming wit or
to serve as a director for her great insight into a particular
industry. People will pay her big bucks only to get the ear of
President Bush. And they are not the people who want to advance "good
policy,'' they are the ones who have "special interests.'' So, I say
there is plenty wrong for her to collect 30 times the salary of a
teacher or a social worker who will work much harder and contribute a
lot more to the general welfare.</LD>

<TE>   What did Miller read that I didn't? All that I could see is that a
person chose living in her home state of Texas over living in
Washington. I didn't see that she considered it a sacrifice to leave
a powerful position, simply that she could do nicely without it. As
one who has declined better opportunities necessitating leaving the
paradise that is Los Angeles, I can only applaud her decision (April
24).</TE>

<TE>   It's such a big deal that Hughes gives up her position of power
because her husband and son whine about being homesick--like that
would ever happen if the tables were turned. The issue not covered is
that employers of all sorts could accommodate men and women balancing
their professional and personal obligations if they would get over
their control issues. Technology is such that many people could do at
least part of their job--and for many most of their job--from home or
at hours that would suit their other obligations. Hughes can do most
of her job from her home with computer, fax, video conferencing and
maybe one day a week in Washington--there's no reason for her to
quit.</TE>

<LD>Re "Rising Pedestrian Death Toll Studied," April 24: It seems that
the only way to reduce pedestrian deaths is to add a pedestrian cycle
to the traffic signals at intersections. During this pedestrian
cycle, only pedestrians are allowed into the intersection. They can
cross the street in any direction, including diagonally. Sufficient
time must be provided for them to complete the crossing, even for the
handicapped.</LD>
<LD>   The traffic lights for cars in all directions are red, and no cars
are allowed into the intersection. The penalty for violators is a
heavy fine and mandatory imprisonment. Critics may argue that the
pedestrian cycle will add cost and increase travel time. But if it
saves lives, isn't it worth the cost and time?</LD>

<LD>Katherine Rotherham (letter, April 25) thinks that a drift to the
right led by Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft of the Republican Party should
be a wake-up call for our democracy. I think she's got it backward.
The definition of "conservative" is a strict adherence to an original
principle or philosophy. The definition of "liberal" is a moving away
from an original principle or philosophy.</LD>
<LD>   What conservatives in America want is a return to the original
principles of our Constitution, which severely limits government's
role in our lives. The truth is that the wake-up call to our
democracy is the continual meddling and taking away of our freedoms
that liberals are thrusting upon us.</LD>

<LD>Re "Is Democracy Always Worth the Trouble?" Commentary, April 24:
Just like the financial analysts who recommended Enron stock right up
to the crash, Rand policy analyst Angel Rabasa has put out a "buy"
recommendation on the Bush administration assertion that it did not
encourage or support the Venezuela coup.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps reading the newspaper should be included in the job
description of policy analyst; there he would have read that U.S.
officials met with coup plotters many times in the months preceding
the coup and noticed that our government formed ties with the new
government. Those alone are credible indications of U.S. aid in
unseating the elected leaders of Venezuela.</LD>
<LD>   History teaches that we will not learn the truth behind the coup
until it leaks or until it is too late to make a difference.
Plausible deniability is a big industry both in and out of
government, and we must question the motives of those who pretend not
to know it.</LD>
<TE>   Bill Pilling</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rabasa wrote, "There are no credible indications of U.S.
encouragement or support of [Hugo] Chavez's overthrow. That would
have been inconsistent with U.S. international obligations." Maybe
it's not credible to Rabasa, but it's very credible to anyone even
vaguely familiar with U.S. machinations in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   There's a long and ignoble record of U.S. interference in the
internal affairs of Latin American countries, notably in Chile, where
the U.S. engineered a bloody coup that brought the fascist dictator
Augusto Pinochet to power. The U.S. is notorious for its underhanded
dealings in Latin America; the war on the so-called narco-terrorists
in Colombia is the most recent example.</TE>

<LD>"A Quiet Broker of the Wild," your April 24 article regarding the
Wildlands Conservancy, didn't cover one of the major benefits that
Wildlands provides to Southern California. In addition to purchasing
vacant land, Wildlands is also dedicated to enhancing the lives of
disadvantaged, at-risk urban youth through profound, yet fun, outdoor
camping and outdoor education programs.</LD>
<LD>   To date, Wildlands has provided funding for over 140,000 children.
These less-fortunate youths experience the wondrous world beyond
their neighborhoods when they participate, at no cost, in a Wildlands
program. Many of them have never been out of their own, often
dangerous, neighborhoods. In the outdoor environment, they learn
there are other worlds, options and choices available to them.
Children who participate in the programs are encouraged to return and
hopefully advance to camp counselor positions.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was glad to see that Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) helped to
introduce the bipartisan Endangered Species Recovery Act on April 24.
This legislation would help return a species to its natural
population and habitat, not just keep it on the endangered species
list in perpetuity.</LD>
<LD>   The bill would provide for good scientific analysis and creation
of recovery plans for species so that their populations would start
to grow. The bill would also benefit landowners who commit to
conservation by providing them with incentives.</LD>
<LD>   The Endangered Species Act was created in 1973 to protect
threatened and endangered species and their habitat. It has been
instrumental in preventing certain species from becoming extinct,
such as the California condor. It is time to take this a step further
and revive species populations, which is what the Endangered Species
Recovery Act would do through multiple landowner, multi-species
conservation plans.</LD>

<HD>It Wasn't Wrigleyville That Gummed This Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>There's a big, ugly screen around the edges of Wrigley Field, the
kind usually found around tennis courts to keep the balls in and nosy
spectators out.</LD>
<LD>   Call it the spite screen, put up by team ownership to get back at
a neighborhood that balked at Wrigley expansion plans.</LD>
<LD>   Wrigley Field was the place where I watched my first baseball
game. It was a rite-of-passage place for us in the Chicago suburbs.
When your parents let you go to Wrigley by yourself, taking the train
and the El, trusting you to find your way to and from the game, it
was as big as the day you got your driver's license.</LD>
<TE>   Ernie Banks and Ron Santo were the sporting heroes of my
childhood. Who needed championships when you had Mr. Cub and Santo
doing his goofy sideways kick after a big play?</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who got our baseball education at Wrigley, change
is hard to accept.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a happy day in 1988 when lights went up. In fact my
first night game at Wrigley came earlier this week. Say this for
progress--the lights weren't important. The screen was the horror.
And it hurts to say this, but my bosses, the Tribune Company, put up
the screen.</TE>
<TE>   There is a big, long, politically inspired story about Wrigley,
the Tribune, the screen, Mayor Daley, Soldier Field and why it might
not be the best idea for a big media company to own a sports team and
a ballpark that an entire city feels is its own.</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs, a.k.a. Tribune Company, would like to add another 1,900
or so bleacher seats to Wrigley, which has the fourth-smallest
capacity among major league ballparks. Surrounding Wrigley are old,
brick apartment buildings. Once upon a time, the apartment dwellers
would lug grills, lawn chairs and a cooler with some cold Old Style
beer up to the roof and watch the Cubbies.</TE>
<TE>   Now the apartment building owners have put bleachers on the roofs
and sell tickets for up to $125. When the Cubs announced a desire to
add more bleachers, the neighborhood dwellers, most particularly the
apartment owners of the lucrative rooftops, weren't happy. These new
bleachers, they say, will block rooftop views.</TE>
<TE>   The city, which would need to issue building permits and zoning
variances, is having a little fun with the Tribune. The city is
siding with the neighbors. The city, especially the mayor, is unhappy
because the Chicago Tribune editorial board has been critical of the
city's renovation of Soldier Field, home of the Bears.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the criticism and the laggardly pace of the
approval process for its bleachers, the Tribune Company put up the
screen.</TE>
<TE>   According to a story in the Tribune, the dark green mesh screen is
a security response to Sept. 11. More than 1,000 people who don't get
their bags scanned coming into the park are up on those rooftops and
could throw anything they wanted onto the field, according to Tribune
Company officials. That's disingenuous, bordering on a slimy use of
the Sept. 11 tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The screen is for spite.</TE>
<TE>   All those people paying for the roof seats aren't paying the
Tribune for box seats or luxury box seats. They aren't buying
ballpark franks or popcorn or frosted malts or beer or soda. About
the lost revenue, the Tribune Company has a point.</TE>
<TE>   But the point the Tribune Company misses is that there is no
sports stadium that is more a part of the community around it than
Wrigley Field. Wrigley doesn't just happen to be in Chicago. It is
Chicago. It is this symbiosis that is so special.</TE>
<TE>   From the seats inside Wrigley, you hear the clattering El train
and smell dozens of restaurants of all ethnicities. You walk outside
and your shoes stick to ballpark beer that has spilled onto the
sidewalks.</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood around Wrigley and the ballpark have grown up
together into a place known simply as "Wrigleyville."</TE>
<TE>   The screen is more than spiteful. It is symbolic. It is walling
off Wrigley from Wrigleyville.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate Cubs are cutting off their community nose to spite
their face.</TE>
<TE>   If the Tribune wants to be part of the Chicago community, the
voice of the people, it is doing a terrible job. Whatever unseemly
profiteering is happening outside that screen is small potatoes.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the restaurants that have set up shop to serve Cub
fans? Should the Tribune put up fences so that baseball patrons can't
get to those restaurants? Because if those restaurants weren't there,
hungry fans would have to buy Wrigley food. Should the Tribune sic
armed guards on the souvenir hunters who patrol the streets in hopes
of nabbing a home run ball? Shouldn't the money from those balls go
to the Cubs after all? Shouldn't a valuable piece of memorabilia go
to a suit in Tribune Tower? Where do you draw the line?</TE>
<TE>   It is Wrigley Field and the neighborhood that keep the park nearly
sold out every year. It is those bleachers on the apartment tops and
the vendors and the restaurants. It is the game of finding parking or
the fun of taking the El.</TE>
<TE>   It surely isn't the baseball. The actual product the Tribune
Company has put on the field is still awful.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I've been asked, but here, for free, are some
common-sense commandments for anyone who owns the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   * Thou shalt not separate Wrigley from Wrigleyville. Not with
noxious screens and not with self-righteous statements about who owns
what. Being right but being haughty does more harm than good.</TE>
<TE>   * Thou shalt do nothing to remind anyone that Mr. Wrigley doesn't
own the Cubs and the Tribune Company does. Perception is reality. Too
many people (helped by the harping from the other newspaper in town)
believe the Trib treats the Cubs with kid gloves and the White Sox
with spiked tongue.</TE>
<TE>   * If in doubt, do nothing. The place was working pretty well the
way it was. Boardrooms and baseball may work together sometimes. This
isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   * Before adding extra seats, add a championship trophy. With a
World Series trophy, or even a National League title, what's good for
Tribune Tower will be good for Wrigley and vice versa. Win a World
Series and you could put a giant bag over the place and everyone
would cheer.</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The strangest sight in the Portland locker room was Scottie Pippen
and Steve Kerr, two guys who ended every season hoisting the Larry
O'Brien trophy in June not too long ago, getting dressed next to each
other with their season done in April.</LD>
<LD>   The two former Chicago Bulls were swept out of the first round of
the playoffs Sunday when the Lakers wiped out a five-point deficit in
the last 39 seconds to snatch Game 3 from the Portland Trail Blazers,
92-91.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't remember a tougher loss," Kerr said.</LD>
<TE>   Pippen seemed strangely at peace with this defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm never happy to lose," Pippen said. "But losing and
understanding why you lost makes a difference."</TE>
<TE>   Pippen would understand all right. He had much better knowledge
than any other Trail Blazer, because he was intimately involved with
everything that went wrong in the final 10.8 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   First, he missed a free throw that could have given the Trail
Blazers a three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Then he made the wrong choice on defense and left to help on Kobe
Bryant, allowing Robert Horry an open look for the winning
three-point shot. Then he threw a bad inbounds pass for a turnover on
Portland's last chance for a shot.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if Pippen's career has taken a reversal from the normal
path of progression. Usually players bang against a wall before
finally breaking through to glory. Pippen enjoyed all the success
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Call him Michael Jordan's sidekick if you will, but his defense on
Magic Johnson and his speed in the transition game were big reasons
the Bulls beat the Lakers in 1991 to win their first championship.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Pippen and his six rings keep getting kicked to the
curb by the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   This is the fourth consecutive season Pippen has lost to the
Lakers in the playoffs; once with the Houston Rockets and the last
three years in Portland.</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow we have to figure out a way to get past this team,"
Pippen said. "Or get around them."</TE>
<TE>   With Houston in 1999, the Rockets coughed up a one-point lead in
the final 28 seconds when Pippen lost control of the ball and Derek
Fisher went to the floor to grab it and help the Lakers take Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Pippen was a member of the cast of culprits in the Trail Blazers'
fourth-quarter collapse in Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference
finals.</TE>
<TE>   And he missed 14 of his 17 three-pointers and had a team-high 12
turnovers in the Lakers' three-game sweep of the Trail Blazers last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The most unusual thing about Sunday was that Pippen's miscues came
on defense and passing, two elements of his game that separated him
from the rest of the large flock of 6-foot-7 players in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   He might not lock up guys individually anymore, but his team
defense and court knowledge remain unsurpassed in the league. His
roaming defense and long arms played a large role in Portland's
ability to contain Shaquille O'Neal throughout the first half of Game
1 and most of Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   He did what came naturally when he saw Bryant driving past Ruben
Patterson in the waning seconds. He left Horry and stepped in to draw
the charge. But Bryant's body control helped him avoid contact as he
passed out to Horry.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Bryant] had got the step on Ruben," Pippen said. "I
was hoping that he had committed himself in the air, and I was going
to cut him off from the basket."</TE>
<TE>   Instead it was Pippen who committed. He treated Bryant as a bigger
threat than Horry. It all happened so fast that other Portland
players and Coach Maurice Cheeks couldn't even identify the player
involved.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe had the ball and he penetrated the lane and instincts took
over," Cheeks said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure who was in the corner, but his instincts took over.
He stepped in and Horry got a wide-open shot."</TE>
<TE>   But Pippen knew.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't get out to [Horry], basically," Pippen said. "And it
cost us the ballgame."</TE>
<TE>   They had one last chance, with the ball and 2.1 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers tried to run a play to post up Rasheed Wallace
and set a screen for Kerr. It took a while to unfold, and with the
five-second count drawing closer Pippen sent his inbounds pass for
Wallace too high. Horry came down with it.</TE>
<TE>   The team with the most expensive roster in the league, the only
squad with a self-proclaimed "Kobe Stopper," couldn't get a game off
the Lakers for the second consecutive playoff series, settling for
satisfaction at coming close at least once.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave them a run," Pippen said. "That's what we wanted to do."</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been great if we could have won the game, but I'm
very proud of the way that we came out and competed. Everybody in the
world knows that we were undermanned with Shaq and his dominance, but
we came out today and put it on the line and gave ourselves an
opportunity to win the game."</TE>
<TE>   An opportunity that Pippen squandered.</TE>

<HD>White Sox Can't Handle Hudson</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Hudson knew right away he had something special going.</LD>
<LD>   Hudson allowed three hits in eight innings and the Oakland
Athletics defeated the Chicago White Sox, 10-0, Sunday at Oakland to
complete a three-game sweep.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt good when I was spotting my two-seamer in the first
inning," Hudson said. "I realized I could throw it anywhere I
wanted."</LD>
<TE>   Hudson, who also threw his regular fastball, changeup and sinker
for strikes, helped the A's win a season-high fourth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Chavez homered and had four runs batted in and the A's took
advantage of three errors to score four unearned runs. Oakland
outscored Chicago, 32-5, in the series and extended its winning
streak against the White Sox to 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Hudson (3-2), who lost his previous two starts, got 16 groundouts,
struck out five and walked one. Billy Koch finished with a perfect
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Konerko singled with one out in the second to extend his
career-high hitting streak to 16 games, then Hudson retired 16 of the
next 17 batters before Konerko doubled with two out in the seventh.
Only two White Sox runners got as far as second base.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland (15-10) is off to its best start in nine years. Chicago
lost its third in a row after winning nine of 11.</TE>
<TE>   New York 4, Seattle 3--In their first trip west this season, the
Yankees repeated their success from last year's playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Nick Johnson's two-out run-scoring double in the ninth
inning enabled the Yankees to win two of three in Seattle to complete
a 4-2 trip that began at Oakland. The Yankees beat the A's and
Mariners in the last two postseasons en route to winning four
consecutive AL pennants.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando Hernandez and three relievers limited the Mariners to five
hits. Mariano Rivera hit a batter and walked another with one out in
the ninth before striking out pinch-hitter Ichiro Suzuki and retiring
Mark McLemore on a groundout for his eighth save in 10 chances.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees held the Mariners to five runs and a .140 batting
average (12 for 86) in the three games. The Yankees lead the AL with
a 3.45 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Minnesota 4--Bobby Higginson singled home the winning
run with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning, enabling the
Tigers to complete their first series sweep in 34 tries since July.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota trailed, 4-1, before Corey Koskie's two-run homer
against Jose Paniagua in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty tripled against Juan Acevedo leading off
the ninth and scored on Cristian Guzman's groundout against Jamie
Walker. With runners at the corners, Julio Santana retired Torii
Hunter on a groundout.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 13, Kansas City 0--Scott Erickson pitched a four-hitter
for his first shutout in three years and the Orioles completed their
first three-game sweep since September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Marty Cordova had four hits, scored three runs and drove in two.
Geronimo Gil had three hits and three runs batted in, including a
two-run double in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   After Carlos Beltran's infield single in the first, Erickson (3-2)
didn't give up another hit until Mike Sweeney's double in the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   It was Erickson's 12th shutout, his first since a three-hit, 5-0
victory over Minnesota on Sept. 7, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 2, Cleveland 1--Ismael Valdes (2-3) pitched six strong
innings and Rusty Greer drove in the go-ahead run at Arlington,
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Texas' John Rocker got out of a jam in the seventh. He walked Matt
Lawton with one out and gave up a single to Omar Vizquel. But Lawton
was thrown out trying to steal third and Jim Thome struck out to end
the inning.</TE>

<HD>Eckstein Makes a Grand Exit</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Shortstop's second slam in two games powers
Angels past Blue Jays, 8-5, in 14 innings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Somewhere under the mob of Angel humanity at the plate was 5-foot-8
David Eckstein.</LD>
<LD>   A long day's journey into evening ended in the 14th inning, when
Eckstein was more Punch than Judy as a hitter for the second
consecutive game. His grand slam brought the Angels back for an 8-5
victory Sunday and came a day after he hit his first career grand
slam in another Angel victory.</LD>
<LD>   Waiting for him this time was a wild reception committee of
teammates. Eckstein disappeared into that mass, which was as taxing
as the 5 hours 6 minutes of baseball he had played--the longest game
in the major leagues this season.</LD>
<TE>   "I got out of that pile as fast as I could," Eckstein said. "I was
thinking it was about time I did something."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, it had been, like, nearly 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   As was the case Saturday, Eckstein was a bit reluctant in the
glare. His teammates were manhandling him again in the dugout moments
later, shoving him out, as what was left of the 25,073 at Edison
Field demanded a curtain call after the Angels' fourth consecutive
victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Eck is the man," said center fielder Darin Erstad, who returned
to the lineup after sitting out seven games because of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein didn't feel that way until the end. He was hitless in six
previous at-bats. His weak flyout had stranded Adam Kennedy at second
in the 12th inning.</TE>
<TE>   He was placed in harm's way again in the 14th. The Angels fell
behind in the top of the inning, when Tom Wilson's check-swing single
landed fair, 10 feet behind first base, to score Jose Cruz for a 5-4
Toronto lead.</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus led off the bottom of the 14th with a single. Tim
Salmon, who had tied the score in the ninth with a home run, doubled.
Two outs and an intentional walk later, Eckstein was on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd had horrible at-bats," Eckstein said. "I'd left Adam on
second base with two outs and could have ended the game there. I
didn't. I was fortunate to get another opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The unfortunate one was Pedro Borbon (1-2), who had given up
Eckstein's grand slam Saturday. This time, Eckstein golfed a 1-and-1
pitch, his drive just clearing the fence in the left-field corner,
about three feet from where his grand slam had landed Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein said he has worked on getting around on inside pitches
with hitting coach Mickey Hatcher in recent days.</TE>
<TE>   The cramming paid off with two big moments, although Eckstein said
this was not about to become habit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'll go back to hitting ground balls and getting base
hits," Eckstein said. "The nice thing is we got the win."</TE>
<TE>   It took work, as the Angels trailed three times. The Blue Jays
capitalized on opportunities, scoring four of their runs with two
out. Each time, the Angels responded.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who was batting .158 before Sunday's game, had a big part
in the three rallies. He began the game on the bench. Erstad returned
and Manager Mike Scioscia wanted to keep the hot-hitting Orlando
Palmeiro in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was sent to pinch-hit for designated hitter Brad Fullmer in
the seventh and singled, advancing Garret Anderson to third. Scott
Spiezio grounded out to score Anderson and Bengie Molina's pinch-hit
single drove in Salmon, tying the score, 3-3.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, who remained in the game as designated hitter, tied the
score in the ninth with a leadoff home run, his second this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim is expecting to have a day at the ballpark and watch,"
Scioscia said. "Then Tim has to go in and has a big part in the win."</TE>
<TE>   Including mobbing Eckstein at the plate.</TE>

<LD>Lost in the drama Sunday was the mad dash by Angel second baseman
Adam Kennedy, who was thrown out at home while attempting an
inside-the-park home run in the fifth inning.</LD>
<LD>   Kennedy skied a ball into the right-field corner that had Toronto
Blue Jay right fielder Raul Mondesi turning in circles. The ball
bounced off the top of the low wall in the corner, then caromed away
from Mondesi and Kennedy was off.</LD>
<LD>   "When I saw where the ball went, I thought I had a chance,"
Kennedy said.</LD>
<TE>   He sprinted toward third base and was waved home by third base
coach Ron Roenicke.</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi retrieved the ball and fired a perfect one-bounce throw to
catcher Tom Wilson, who had to wait for Kennedy to arrive before
tagging him out.</TE>
<TE>   "That was just Mondesi being 300 feet from home plate and making
the perfect throw," Roenicke said. "What are you going to do?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Everything was as Darin Erstad expected Sunday, as he played in
his first game since April 19.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I hadn't played in a week," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was rusty, my timing was off. It's going to take a little
time."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad hadn't played since suffering a concussion while trying to
make a diving catch against Oakland. He was taken to the hospital and
sat out seven games.</TE>
<TE>   He was hitless in six at-bats but made two running catches in
center field.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, if I didn't feel well on the first day of spring training,
I certainly wasn't going to feel too good today," Erstad said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After the game, the Angels put reliever Donne Wall on the 15-day
disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Wall had tightness in his right arm.
Wall retired all four batters he faced Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are expected to fill Wall's spot today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Eckstein's grand slam in the 14th inning was the first
walk-off grand slam by an Angel since Tim Salmon hit one to beat
Cleveland on April 4, 1997.... Garret Anderson had four hits,
including two doubles and a triple, and scored two runs Sunday....
The two teams used 38 players--14 pitchers and 24 position
players.... Angel starter Scott Schoeneweis went seven innings,
giving up three runs.... The Angels begin a six-game trip to
Cleveland and Toronto. The first stop is Tuesday against the Indians
at Jacobs Field.</TE>

<HD>Pettitte Will Have Left Elbow Examined</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Left-hander Andy Pettitte of the New York Yankees cut short a
throwing session Sunday and flew to Birmingham, Ala., to have his
left elbow checked by a doctor.</LD>
<LD>   Pettitte threw 15 pitches in the Yankee bullpen at Seattle, his
first stint off a mound since being put on the disabled list April
21. He will be examined today by Dr. James Andrews.</LD>
<LD>   Pettitte, 29, said his elbow was not 100% and he wanted to get the
opinion of Andrews.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just not right," he said. "I have to find out if it's
something I can throw through or something that is more serious."</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre said Andrews hopefully would be able to
come up with some answers for Pettitte's elbow problems, which began
March 3 in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to try to find out what's wrong," Torre said. "If
it's anything, we'll address it."</TE>
<TE>   Pettitte, a 15-game winner for the Yankees last season, is 1-1
with a 3.09 earned-run average in three starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Chipper Jones of the Atlanta Braves left Sunday's
game at Turner Field against the Houston Astros after seven innings
because of a sprained right thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was injured as he collided with catcher Brad Ausmus on a
play at the plate that ended the third inning. Jones was trying to
score from second when Orlando Merced fielded Vinny Castilla's single
and threw out Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Jones was replaced by rookie Ryan Langerhans, called up from
double-A Greenville of the Southern League when the Braves put right
fielder B.J. Surhoff on the 15-day disabled list with a severely
sprained right knee. Jones is listed as day to day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Montreal Expos made room for Fernando Tatis' imminent return
by optioning second baseman Henry Mateo to Ottawa, their affiliate in
the triple-A International League.</TE>
<TE>   Tatis, limited to 41 games with Montreal last season because of
injuries, will be recalled today from a rehabilitation assignment
with Brevard County of the Class-A Florida State League and activated
from the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like this move makes us a better ballclub," Expo Manager
Frank Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   The power-hitting third baseman was on the disabled list twice
last season, his first with the Expos after he was acquired in a
trade with the St. Louis Cardinals on Dec. 14, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After going on the disabled list from May 11-25 with a right
shoulder strain, Tatis went back on the disabled list June 3 before
having season-ending surgery on his left knee. He batted .255 with
two homers and 11 runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   Tatis will start at Houston on Tuesday in place of Chris Truby,
who was acquired from the Astros on March 12 after the Expos realized
Tatis wouldn't be ready to begin the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite seemingly endless rain delays and two postponements so far
this season, something remains on schedule for the Pittsburgh
Pirates--Kris Benson's recovery from reconstructive elbow surgery.</TE>
<TE>   After going 17 days between starts because of tendinitis in his
right triceps, Benson made his third consecutive effective
rehabilitation start for Nashville of the triple-A Pacific Coast
League on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he lost to Memphis, 6-0, Benson threw 75 pitches and
gave up two hits and one run. He struck out five and walked two in
five innings.</TE>
<TE>   In his three starts for Nashville, Benson is 0-1 with a 2.13 ERA,
striking out 12 and walking seven, and giving up five hits and three
earned runs--one per start--in 121/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "From all reports, it sounds like he did very well," Pirate
General Manager Dave Littlefield said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City Royals recalled right-hander Brad Voyles from
Omaha and optioned right-hander Nate Field to Omaha, their affiliate
in the Pacific Coast League.</TE>
<TE>   Voyles was 1-0 with four saves in eight appearances at Omaha.
Field appeared in three games with the Royals and gave up five runs
and seven hits in three innings.</TE>

<HD>Stern Wants Longer First-Round Series</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>NBA Commissioner David Stern visited Portland on Sunday on his usual
tour of playoff sites and watched the Trail Blazers and Lakers play
their third game in eight days. There could be more action in the
same amount of time if the league adopts a best-of-seven format for
the first round.</LD>
<LD>   A change from the best-of-five first-round format, which has been
in place since 1984, is a collective bargaining issue that would
require agreement from the players' union.</LD>
<LD>   "We have asked the players association, but we haven't gotten a
positive response from them yet," Stern said. "Remember, the players
get 55% of every dollar we bring in, guaranteed. We estimate that
this could probably bring in over the course of the new deal $100
million.</LD>
<TE>   "That would the total basketball-related income, which would allow
for a higher salary cap."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stern on the difficulties and complaints--from both the Lakers and
the rest of the league--about the officiating on Shaquille O'Neal:</TE>
<TE>   "We used to get the same calls on Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar] and on
every other center that we've had that's been as good or great as
Shaq is. That just emphasizes how difficult it is to ref Shaq. We've
sat and we've watched tape and ... it's hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I think his enormous combination of strength and speed and trying
to find out where the contact is [makes it hard]. He's very difficult
because this is not a completely non-contact sport, and referees can
be thrown off sometimes by what appears to be happening as opposed
[to what is]."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another topic of discussion with Stern was the incident in the
Charlotte-Orlando game Saturday, when the referees nullified a
three-pointer by Charlotte's Baron Davis after he caught the ball
with seven-tenths of a second remaining in regulation. He clearly
beat the buzzer, but the referees got together and decided it wasn't
humanly possible to catch and shoot in that time.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said the issue will be brought up at the competition
committee meeting next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to satisfy our fans that they can understand what our
rules are," Stern said. "And we have to re-evaluate what human beings
can do. Basically you wind up having a standard that says it isn't
humanly possible to do things in less than 0.7 seconds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Dale Davis heard about the Lakers imitating his shirtless
walk off the court after he was ejected for kicking the ball in Game
2.</TE>
<TE>   "That's cool," he said before Game 3. "If they're going to write a
check, I hope they're big enough to cash it."</TE>

<LD>Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer was disgusted by the Flyers'
being eliminated from the NHL playoffs in five games by Ottawa.</LD>
<LD>   "The disintegration is now complete," he wrote. "Along with the
humiliation.</LD>
<LD>   "In one of the most ignominious and inglorious performances in the
mottled history of sports in Philadelphia, the Flyers permitted
themselves to be evicted, forcibly and with pathetic little
resistance, from the playoffs, the very same playoffs in which they
were expected to contend strongly for the Stanley Cup ...</LD>
<TE>   "Of all the galling eliminations the Flyers have sustained of
late, this was the most inexcusable and embarrassing."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA playoff record for most minutes
played in a game without a turnover?</TE>
<TE>   What a bargain! Jon Saraceno in USA Today: "In Memphis, 'The
Disagreement at Disgraceland,' Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson, already
is boxing's all-time blockbuster gate with a record gate of $20
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's how crazy things are getting: EBay is auctioning four
fight tickets, airfare and hotel, all for only $50,000."</TE>
<TE>   Big deal: Washington State President V. Lane Rawlins wants the
word "Wazzu" purged from T-shirts, coffee mugs and other
university-related products on the grounds it is vaguely derogatory
and plays to the perception that WSU is a place where booze trumps
books.</TE>
<TE>   Come on, Mr. Rawlins, don't you have more important matters on
your agenda?</TE>
<TE>   He'll be busy: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle writes
that the Oakland Raiders drafted with a plan: "In the sixth round,
for example, they picked a criminal justice major, San Diego State
running back Larry Ned.</TE>
<TE>   "Smart move, draft someone who can help you deal with your
previous years' draft picks."</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "The Masters passes a rule that goes into effect in
2004, that former champions can't play once they turn 65.</TE>
<TE>   "Blatantly racist! An obvious ploy to stop Tiger Woods from
dominating the tournament 39 years from now."</TE>
<TE>   Says it all: Headline in the New York Post after Met pitcher Shawn
Estes had a one-hitter against Milwaukee on Friday night: "Mr.
One-Derful."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1969, Wilt Chamberlain set a Laker
playoff record with 31 rebounds against Boston. He would improve the
record to 33 two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1986, Boston's Roger Clemens
broke a long-standing major league record when he struck out 20
Seattle Mariners in a 3-1 victory at Fenway Park.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Dan Majerle of the Phoenix Suns, 59 minutes against
Chicago in a three-overtime game on June 13, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: For years, Detroit fans have thrown an octopus onto
the ice after goals scored during the Stanley Cup playoff games. It
will be difficult now.</TE>
<TE>   A Joe Louis Arena spokeswoman said security will confiscate any
item they feel fans will throw on the ice. Anyone throwing anything
on the ice--including the popular octopi--will be hauled off,
reported the Macomb Daily in Mount Clemens, Mich.</TE>

<LD>   What: Distant Thunder, When Midgets Were Mighty</LD>
<LD>   Author: Dick Wallen</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Racing Classics, P.O. Box 10561, Glendale, Ariz. 85318</TE>
<TE>   Price: $125, plus $10 shipping</TE>
<TE>   If books were classified by weight, Dick Wallen's thorough history
of the midget car racing craze from 1914 to 1950 would be on
everyone's best-seller list. It is nearly 400 pages crammed with more
than 1,000 photographs, original color paintings and detailed
information about the cars that captivated Californians from 1945
through 1950.</TE>
<TE>   Races were held seven nights a week, attracting as many as 65,000
at the Coliseum and Rose Bowl, plus jam-packed Gilmore Stadium. The
track, date, winner, car owner, car number and winner's payoff for
every West Coast race during that period is chronicled.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, midget racing wore itself out as anything that goes
seven nights a week gets tiresome," said Gordon Betz, one of racing's
leading officials.</TE>
<TE>   The midgets were a training ground for the Indianapolis 500. Many
of the drivers, such as Bill Vukovich, Troy Ruttman, Rodger Ward, Sam
Hanks, Jimmy Bryan and Parnelli Jones later went on to win at Indy.
But not forgotten were popular favorites such as Herk Hurtubise,
Manny Ayulo, Walt Faulkner, Duke Nalon and the irrepressible Dominic
Distarce.</TE>
<TE>   There is a chapter by Danny Oakes in which he covers his career
from 1933-1975, and there are also segments on the car builders and
equipment suppliers who made Southern California the center of
racing.</TE>
<TE>   Featured too is Rajo Jack, who won so many "all-black drivers"
races at White Sox Speedway in 1936 that he was accepted into the
big-time races--where he continued to win.</TE>

<HD>Reid Putting Together Nice Package Deals</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Three horses sold by bloodstock agent have
paid off big for owner Gann and trainer Frankel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LOUISVILLE, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Bobby Frankel and Edmund Gann wouldn't know Mark Reid if they
stumbled over him. But almost every time Gann calls Frankel to
discuss their horses, the Rancho Santa Fe businessman asks: "How
about that guy Reid? Has he got any more to sell?"</LD>
<LD>   Reid, a 51-year-old former leading trainer on the Philadelphia-New
Jersey circuit, is a bloodstock agent now, and the three horses he
has sold Gann and his trainer Frankel in the last eight months all
have hit home runs. You, a 3-year-old filly, is a Grade I winner
who'll be one of the favorites at Churchill Downs Friday in the
$500,000 Kentucky Oaks; Labamta Babe was a stakes-winning colt before
a minor leg injury derailed him from the Triple Crown trail; and
Medaglia d'Oro, winner of the San Felipe at Santa Anita and second in
the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, probably will be the second or third
betting choice in Saturday's Kentucky Derby here.</LD>
<LD>   Interviewed on the phone from his New Jersey home, Reid said he'd
be traveling to Kentucky in time for the Derby. When he shows up at
Frankel's barn at Churchill, he'll probably get a rousing cheer
instead of the perfunctory handshake. He did sell Frankel one horse
that never won a race, but the three Frankel trains for Gann would be
a bargain at any price.</LD>
<TE>   Frankel won't say how much Medaglia d'Oro, You and Labamta Babe
cost, but he will concede that all three were bought for less than $1
million. Many horsemen seek out quality by spending freely at rich
public auctions, but Frankel prefers the prepackaged route.</TE>
<TE>   "There's less risk this way," the 60-year-old Hall of Fame trainer
said. "But let's face it, we've been lucky. What's going to happen
happens. But it's sure nice to have three of the top 3-year-olds in
the country."</TE>
<TE>   Labamta Babe's injury, not serious enough to prevent him from
returning to training last week in California, came after he beat
Siphonic, one of the early Derby favorites before he was sidelined,
at Santa Anita. That sent Frankel back into the 3-year-old market for
the 78-year-old Gann, whose only Derby starter, Burnt Hills, finished
next to last in 1990, when Unbridled won the race.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Reid had been tipped off by an old training
friend, David Vance, that Medaglia d'Oro's owners were entertaining
offers for their colt. In two races for Vance, Medaglia d'Oro had
finished second as a 2-year-old and broken his maiden in February
with a convincing win at Oaklawn Park. After Reid called Frankel,
Gann's trainer watched Medaglia d'Oro's win on tape.</TE>
<TE>   Frankel, as he usually does with his owners, waited until Medaglia
d'Oro had been thoroughly examined before he contacted Gann. There
was a little back and forth with the colt's owners and breeders,
Albert and Joyce Bell of Great Falls, Mont., but Gann's second offer
was accepted and the horse was sent from Arkansas to Frankel's barn
at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Desormeaux, who won the Derby with Real Quiet in 1998 and
Fusaichi Pegasus in 2000 (and who's one of the jockey nominees this
year for the Racing Hall of Fame, with the announcement due here
Tuesday), rides a lot of Frankel's horses, but he was unavailable,
being tied up with U S S Tinosa, another leading 3-year-old. So when
Medaglia d'Oro was ready to run for the first time with Gann's red,
white and blue colors, Frankel tapped Laffit Pincay, the ageless
veteran.</TE>
<TE>   On March 17 in the San Felipe at Santa Anita, Pincay gave the colt
a vintage daredevil ride, not unlike the heroics that produced a
Belmont Stakes win with Caveat 19 years ago. Cutting a wicked corner,
Pincay just missed bouncing off the fence, got through and beat U S S
Tinosa by 21/2 lengths. Siphonic, the 2-5 favorite, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Anita Derby, on April 6, might have been next for
Medaglia d'Oro, but instead Frankel flew him across the country to
run a week later in the Wood in New York. Medaglia d'Oro would have
had to beat Came Home, the eventual winner at Santa Anita, but
actually Frankel chose a spot against a field that top to bottom was
more fully packed.</TE>
<TE>   It would have cost Gann a $15,000 penalty to run at Santa Anita.
Medaglia d'Oro could have been nominated for $2,500 by Feb. 28, a
week after Gann bought him, but because of an oversight, the payment
wasn't made.</TE>
<TE>   "The rules for the Santa Anita Derby are a joke," Frankel said.
"For the Wood you can nominate as late as a couple of weeks before
the race. It wasn't the extra money that stopped us from running at
Santa Anita. I sent the colt to New York to make a statement to the
Santa Anita racing office more than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   With Pincay aboard again, Medaglia d'Oro was outfinished by Buddha
after a long stretch drive, losing the Wood by a head. That was only
Medaglia d'Oro's fourth career race, a reality that concerns Frankel
going into the 11/4-mile Derby. A horse with only four starts hasn't
won the Derby since Exterminator in 1918.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had been training him earlier, I probably would have tried
putting one more race into him," said Frankel, whose best Derby
finish from three starters has been Aptitude's second to Fusaichi
Pegasus two years ago. "Medaglia d'Oro's a big, strong horse, but
it's hard to say if he would have needed that one more race."</TE>
<TE>   Pincay, 55, will be riding in his 21st Derby, which will tie the
late Eddie Arcaro for second place on the appearance list. Bill
Shoemaker, who won four Derbys, rode in 26. Pincay, whose only Derby
win came with Swale in 1984, hadn't ridden in the race in six years
when he finished 11th with Millennium Wind last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a sloppy Belmont Park track, Buddha worked six furlongs in
1:133/5. The Wood Memorial winner will be taken from New York to
Louisville today.... It'sallinthechase worked five furlongs in
1:013/5 on a packed-down but muddy track at Churchill Downs. Wild
Horses also worked there in 1:011/5.... The forecast includes a
chance of showers Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Friday and
Saturday are expected to be partly cloudy, with no rain and
temperatures in the low 70s.... The last off track for a Derby was
when Go For Gin won in sloppy going in 1994.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Are Twice the Team Cubs Are</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers are about 10 straight division titles and seven Cy Young
Awards away from being compared to the Atlanta Braves and their
rotation of Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and Co., but they have to like
how they match up in the arms race so far this season.</LD>
<LD>   One superb start seems to beget another for the Dodgers, who threw
two more gems at the hapless Chicago Cubs on Sunday to sweep a
doubleheader, 5-4 and 4-1, before 35,527 in frigid Wrigley Field.</LD>
<LD>   Braving 40-degree temperatures and 22-mph winds on a gloomy,
overcast day, left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii limited the Cubs to one run
and three hits in seven innings of the opener, striking out eight and
walking three to improve to 5-0, the best start for a Dodger starting
pitcher since Orel Hershiser began 1985 with a 5-0 mark.</LD>
<TE>   Right-hander Andy Ashby then blanked the Cubs on one hit for eight
innings in the nightcap, striking out eight and walking none to give
the Dodgers a sweep of the three-game series, a 5-1 trip through
Pittsburgh and Chicago and a share of first place with Arizona in the
National League West.</TE>
<TE>   With Odalis Perez's one-hit shutout of Chicago on Friday, Dodger
starters combined to give up one run and five hits in 24 innings of
the series, striking out 22 and walking three, for a 3-0 record and
0.38 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, this came against a struggling Cub team that has scored
the fewest runs in the league and is off to an 8-15 start. But Dodger
starters have combined for a 15-7 record and 2.51 ERA on the season,
and that includes only three starts by their ace, Kevin Brown, who
will return from the disabled list Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they're feeding off each other," pitching coach Jim
Colborn said. "They have pride, they have high standards that are
realizable, and their expectations are higher. Once they do it, they
see what's possible."</TE>
<TE>   Left fielder Brian Jordan, who played the last three seasons in
Atlanta, wouldn't go so far as to compare the Dodger and Brave
rotations, but he is not shocked by what his new teammates have
accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not amazing because the expectations are so high," Jordan
said. "We have six starters who expect to go out and win every night,
and we expect them to keep us in the game. That's what they've been
doing.</TE>
<TE>   "And now the offense is starting to come around and put pressure
on the other team, and that's a good thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan hit a three-run homer in the ninth inning of the first game
and doubled and scored the Dodgers' first run of the nightcap. The
Dodgers got contributions from their bench--reserve catcher Chad
Kreuter had two hits, including a run-scoring single, in the first
game; reserve infielder Alex Cora had a run-scoring single and
tripled and scored in the second game, and utility infielder Dave
Hansen had an RBI double in the nightcap.</TE>
<TE>   The second game was never in doubt. Ashby's sinkers and cut
fastballs had good life, and only one Cub reached second base against
him. Hansen (double) and Cora (single) knocked in runs in the fourth,
and Cora (triple), Cesar Izturis (RBI double) and Paul Lo Duca (RBI
single) keyed a two-run rally in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers almost blew the opener, a game they appeared to
lock up when Jordan, who has reached base in 20 consecutive games,
lined a three-run home run into the left-field bleachers off reliever
Jeff Fassero in the ninth, turning a tight 2-1 game into a 5-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Closer Eric Gagne was warming up during the rally, which included
pinch-hitter Marquis Grissom's leadoff single and Shawn Green's RBI
single, and as soon as Jordan's homer cleared the wall, Tracy ordered
Gagne to sit and set-up man Giovanni Carrara to resume throwing.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, after Sammy Sosa led off the bottom of the ninth
with a single and Moises Alou hammered a two-run homer off Carrara,
pulling the Cubs within 5-3, Tracy summoned Gagne.</TE>
<TE>   Gagne struck out Alex Gonzalez, but Mark Bellhorn walked.
Pinch-hitter Roosevelt Brown doubled off the right-center-field wall
to score Bellhorn and make it 5-4, the first run Gagne has yielded
this season.</TE>
<TE>   But Gagne recovered to strike out pinch-hitters Todd Hundley and
Fred McGriff for his ninth save in nine opportunities,, one behind
major league leader Mike Williams of Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "We had another taste of his poise as a young closer," Tracy said.
"He knew he made a bad pitch [on a high changeup] to Brown and
regrouped very nicely and pitched tremendously well to Hundley and
McGriff."</TE>
<TE>   If Gagne is giving Tracy a taste of his poise, the Dodger rotation
is giving the manager a heaping portion of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's neat to watch them feed off each other," Tracy said. "It's a
wonderful competition, and it's healthy for the club. It's a
can-you-top-this situation, and that's OK."</TE>

<HD>Ishii Has Opposition Buckling at the Knees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii said in spring training he'd be happy to
win 12 games this season, his first in the big leagues after 10 years
in Japan. At his current pace, he'll have 12 wins before the All-Star
break.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii became the second pitcher to post five wins without a loss
this season--Arizona's Randy Johnson is 6-0--when he gave up one run
and three hits in seven innings of the Dodgers' 5-4 Game 1 victory
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   With that kind of start, it wouldn't be a stretch to think Ishii
could win 15 or more. Especially if he keeps pitching as well out of
the stretch as he did Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Continuing a pattern from his previous two starts, Ishii struggled
early Sunday, giving up Corey Patterson's home run to lead off the
first and walking three and hitting a batter in the first three
innings.</TE>
<TE>   But Ishii scrapped his windup to start the fourth, pitching
exclusively from the stretch, and struck out six of the next 12
batters before being pulled for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. He
gave up one hit and did not walk a batter in his last four innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my idea," Ishii, whose Dodger tenure has been marked by
his seemingly endless tinkering with his delivery and mechanics, said
through an interpreter. "I felt I had better control and command in
that position. The main reason was to control my rhythm."</TE>
<TE>   Most indicative of Ishii's quick transformation Sunday was a
fifth-inning strikeout of Patterson, who froze on a sharp inside
slider and swung meekly as the ball popped into catcher Chad
Kreuter's mitt. The pitch so baffled Patterson, his at-bat could have
been scored a strikeout looking and swinging.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how Nolan Ryan used to throw the breaking ball, by making
guys buckle," Kreuter said. "That pitch started right at [Patterson]
and then froze him."</TE>
<TE>   Kreuter also helped Ishii escape trouble in the seventh. With the
Cubs trailing, 2-1, Mark Bellhorn led off with a double, and Robert
Machado squared to bunt and missed. Bellhorn strayed too far off
second, Kreuter gunned a throw to the bag, and Bellhorn was tagged
out in a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago slugger Sammy Sosa had a .457 lifetime average with three
homers and eight runs batted in against right-hander Andy Ashby
before Sunday, but Ashby held him hitless in three at-bats in the
nightcap. Ashby struck out Sosa looking at a fastball in the fourth
inning.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a matter of making pitches," said Ashby, who gave up one
hit in eight shutout innings. "I was ahead in the count more than
I've been in the past few starts. I felt great, my rhythm was a lot
better, and I mixed my pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby, who has struggled at times in his return from elbow
surgery, said Sunday was the best he's felt all season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to get too overconfident, but my timing felt a lot
better today," he said. "I felt good. And not walking six guys [as he
did in his last start against San Diego last Sunday] helped."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown showed no stiffness, soreness or swelling from
Saturday's 90-pitch workout in Los Angeles and will be activated from
the disabled list to start Tuesday night against Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Omar Daal, who went 2-0 with an 0.73 ERA in two starts
in place of Brown, will return to the bullpen, and reliever Guillermo
Mota will probably be sent to triple-A Las Vegas. The Dodgers plan to
monitor Brown closely, looking for signs that he might be putting too
much stress on his surgically repaired elbow.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's right, he's not inclined to throw a lot of balls,"
Manager Jim Tracy said. "When [fatigue] happens, it happens very
quickly. If he starts to fatigue and if you're not on top of that,
you can get caught off guard."</TE>

<LD>That's it, I've had it up to Shaq's ears, my jukebox's blown a fuse.</LD>
<LD>   Welcome to Operation Overload, the story of my brain in the
Information Age.</LD>
<LD>   This onset comes as a result of recently being assigned another
computer-related "password" which, at last count, brings the running
total to, oh, 25 or 30.</LD>
<TE>   "Password" was a fine game show hosted by Allen Ludden, yet now I
can't even watch reruns because the very word triggers anger knowing
some tool bar-tender in tech resources is about to cause another
noggin logjam.</TE>
<TE>   Once, "Open Sesame" served as a perfectly respectable password--it
was a favorite of genies and gentiles--while a "PIN" number applied
specifically to bowling, for example, the dreaded 7-10 split.</TE>
<TE>   Now, you can't pick up a phone or log on to a computer or go about
your daily business without having to cull from the cobwebs of
memory.</TE>
<TE>   A number of these passwords must be at least six characters and
include one numeral and a lowercase letter.</TE>
<TE>   For security reasons, in many cases, you must commit these codes
to memory and destroy the physical evidence.</TE>
<TE>   So, I ask: Did my life need to become the opening of "Mission
Impossible?"</TE>
<TE>   Recently, my company converted to an electronic expense reporting
system, which required--bingo--more codes, only adding to the digital
pile. I now need a password to withdraw money from the bank, review
my 401K, log on to the Internet, click onto my favorite Web sites,
review my frequent flier account, sign on to my e-mail, sign on to
our newspaper's archive system and intra-office system.</TE>
<TE>   Passwords are required for my office voice mail, home business
voice mail and cell phone voice mail.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure the Amazing Kreskin, even in his prime, could keep a
handle on so many figures.</TE>
<TE>   Should I lock keys in my SUV, of course, there's a secret code
that will open the door. (I don't know it.) At home, we have codes to
reprogram the television remote control and one to turn off our fire
alarm. (I'm batting .500 on this frontal lobe front.)</TE>
<TE>   Not long back, a man in tech support flashed me an Albert Belle
dagger stare after noticing I had Scotch-taped my top-secret
passwords onto my laptop computer.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice security," he snapped.</TE>
<TE>   It was either that or taping codes to a wristband like a
quarterback on game day. That's the problem with high tech, it has
become as bloated as Paul Hackett's playbook.</TE>
<TE>   A brain crash was inevitable. My synapses snapped recently at the
local ATM.</TE>
<TE>   You know the drill: Stick left arm out car window, extract quick
cash from dispenser. Except, when I went to punch in the PIN, my
brain froze like a left-hander standing in the batter's box against
Randy Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   I had to pull away from the kiosk--embarrassed and strapped for
cash.</TE>
<TE>   What does this have to do with sports?</TE>
<TE>   Plenty.</TE>
<TE>   In simpler times, sports helped keep my figures straight.</TE>
<TE>   I can still remember my high school locker combination, 44-17-8,
because I attached a sporting face to it. My combination was not a
sequence of abstract numbers but a series of uniform numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Hence, 44-17-8 was Henry Aaron-Jim Hart-Carl Yastrzemski.</TE>
<TE>   I can remember my high school locker number was 717 because it was
Babe Ruth's career home run total plus three.</TE>
<TE>   You say stupid and sophomoric?</TE>
<TE>   Hey, I was a stupid sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, this system worked brilliantly for years. In the 1980s, I
could commit to memory a gym locker combination because to me it was
Joe Montana (16), Nolan Ryan with the Angels (30) and former Ram
cornerback Jerry Gray (25).</TE>
<TE>   What could be simpler? Go to Montana, twist right to Ryan and then
left to Gray.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, I owed a debt of gratitude to the New York Yankees
because, prior to 1929, baseball players didn't wear uniform numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, this meant an early 20th century fan of the Chicago Cubs
could not take advantage of Tinker to Evers to Chance as a way of
unlocking a bike chain.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees revolutionized the numbers-game game when, for
purposes of making players more recognizable to fans, they affixed
numbers to their men based on the team's batting order.</TE>
<TE>   Earle Combs batted first, so he was No. 1. And so it followed.
Mark Koenig was No. 2, Babe Ruth was No. 3, Lou Gehrig was No. 4, Bob
Meusel was No. 5, Tony Lazzeri wore No. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers became synonymous with players allowing a future kid to
remember combinations by simply remembering pictures on trading
cards: Willie Mays (24), Jim Brown (32), Wayne Gretzky (99).</TE>
<TE>   Then it went haywire. Players grew weary of indentured servitude.
A labor boss named Marvin Miller helped forge free agency, which led
to player movement and a Dizzy Dean-dizzying era of uniform changes.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Gates complicated the matter irrevocably by launching that
"Windows" ship.</TE>
<TE>   My system started taking a beating. Ryan went from No. 30 with the
Angels to No. 34 with Houston. Montana, always the No. 16 in
combination code, ended up a No. 19 with the Kansas City Chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jordan, a No. 23 you could always count on, retired, then
came back as a No. 45. Then he retired again, only to return as a No.
23.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr. was No. 24 in Seattle. He could never replace Mays
as the Say Hey Code Kid, but it didn't help when Griffey left Seattle
and became a No. 30 for the Cincinnati Reds.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder this confounding confluence of password and number swaps
came to a head at the ATM. I couldn't remember if my PIN number was
Ripken (8), Johnson (51), Don Drysdale (53), or some combination of
Ryan with the Rangers (34), Deacon Jones (75) or Ted Williams (9).</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps I was confusing my ATM number with an old college lock
combination. Joe DiMaggio (5), Roman Gabriel (18), Gordie Howe (9).</TE>
<TE>   No doubt, this not-so-beautiful mind is teetering on the
technology brink.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Buffalo Bills recently acquire quarterback Drew Bledsoe
in trade from New England.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: if he doesn't get to keep uniform No. 11, I may
have to call a locksmith.</TE>

<HD>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Highlight reel: Well, the Mavericks sure looked good polishing off
the Timberwolves in three games, which makes you wonder: Why couldn't
NBC put the Lakers and Trail Blazers in a little box in the corner
while sticking with the conclusion of the Dallas-Minnesota game? It's
called a lack of imagination, boys and girls. Meanwhile, in Portland,
the Lakers and Trail Blazers toss bricks at the basket in a
lackluster opening six minutes. Or so we're told by NBC's announcing
crew in Minneapolis. By the time we get to Portland, it's 9-6, Trail
Blazers, and 5:56 remains in the quarter. Nice work.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: A sense of urgency. Where's the passion?
Where's the emotion? Perhaps both teams know what's to come and feel
powerless to change the inevitable.</LD>
<LD>   Winning number: The Trail Blazers forced the Lakers to miss six of
their first seven shots.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong number: 19-19. After defending well enough to keep the
Lakers off balance, the best Portland can do is a tie after the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Kobe Bryant 6, Derek Fisher 5, Shaquille
O'Neal 4; Trail Blazers--Scottie Pippen 6, Rasheed Wallace 5, Bonzi
Wells and Derek Anderson 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Samaki Walker 4, Rick Fox 3; Trail
Blazers--Wallace and Pippen 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: With the Lakers finally showing some life, Fox cut
to the basket and Robert Horry slipped him the ball on a textbook
backdoor play for a basket and a 46-39 lead late in the quarter. It's
the most eye-catching play during a 16-4 Laker run to end the half,
although it probably will be overlooked in every TV highlight
package. No flash, all substance. It's a sign of the many ways the
versatile Lakers can subdue an opponent. They don't always need
Bryant's flair or O'Neal's thunder to win.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The Lakers' resilience can't be measured by
statistics. They excelled in the quarter at taking the Trail Blazers'
best shots and moving forward without missing a beat. They looked
poised and that's why they held a nine-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: O'Neal had 10 points, five rebounds and six
assists by halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: Trail Blazer guard Damon Stoudamire played only
seven minutes by halftime and contributed nothing of note, a grim
reminder of his team's lack of offensive depth.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 8, O'Neal 6, Horry and Devean
George 5; Trail Blazers--Steve Kerr 7, Pippen, Wallace and Anderson
4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 4, Fisher 2 ; Trail
Blazers--Dale Davis 4, Pippen 3 .</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The most important lap of a mile run is the third.
The most important quarter of a basketball game isn't always the
third, but often it sets the tone for what's to come. The Lakers lost
their lead, trailed, 59-53, after an 18-3 Trail Blazer run and looked
as if they had no interest in ending this thing here and now.
Wallace's driving dunk followed by Wells' slam got the Trail Blazers
and the sellout crowd at the Rose Garden going at long last.
Stoudamire even responded with a short-range jumper and a
three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Momentum is often fleeting in the NBA, but
the Lakers took it to extremes. They looked content to start the
second half, and instead of pressing ahead, building a lead that
might have broken the Trail Blazers' spirit, the Lakers' poor play
inspired Portland into perhaps its best quarter of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Trail Blazers forced the Lakers to miss their
first 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Trail Blazers should have done better than
merely a tie score after such an impressive start to the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Fox 6, Bryant 5, Fisher 3; Trail
Blazers--Pippen 7, Stoudamire, Wallace and Wells 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry 3; Trail Blazers--Wells and
Wallace 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fourth Quarter</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Bryant dribbled into a double-team of Ruben
Patterson and Pippen. Instead of forcing a shot over them, Bryant
spied an open Horry beyond the three-point arc in the right corner.
Bryant passed to Horry and Horry stuck a dagger into the hearts of
the Trail Blazers, making the go-ahead three-pointer with 2.1 seconds
remaining. At the other end, Horry intercepted Pippen's atrocious
inbounds pass, which was intended for Wallace. The Lakers would have
been in trouble had the pass connected because Fisher was forced into
a switch on Wallace.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: A reason for Pippen's blooper with the game
on the line. Moments earlier, he missed the second of two free
throws, setting up Horry's go-ahead three-pointer. He capped that
with a horrid throw-in. It's the final example of why the Trail
Blazers cannot defeat the Lakers in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers have won seven consecutive playoff
games over the Trail Blazers, sweeping them in the first round the
last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Davis has fouled out three times and been ejected
twice in five playoff games for the Trail Blazers against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 8, Bryant and Fox 6; Trail
Blazers--Wells 9, Wallace 5, Anderson 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 5, Horry 2; Trail
Blazers--Wallace 3, Wells 2.</TE>

<HD>Calkins Road Proves to Be Smooth Ride</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BOB MIESZERSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although none of the participants Sunday reminded anyone of the horse
the race was named for, the $250,000 Snow Chief Stakes, the richest
event on Hollywood Park's third Gold Rush Day, was at least exciting.</LD>
<LD>   Calkins Road, the 4-1 third choice whose only victory had come in
a maiden race Feb. 7, wore down a weary Menacing Dennis, the 7-2
second choice, to give trainer John Shirreffs his second Snow Chief
victory in four years.</LD>
<LD>   Ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., Calkins Road, who won by a head,
completed the 11/8 miles in 1:51, the slowest time for the race since
it was lengthened to nine furlongs in 1999. The final eighth of a
mile took nearly 14 seconds to negotiate.</LD>
<TE>   "He's a trier and he is getting better all the time," Pincay said.
"In his last race, he had some trouble in the stretch. He is a nice
colt. I think he has a good future."</TE>
<TE>   During the 10-race program restricted to California-breds, Pincay
was one of three jockeys to have more than one stakes victory. The
world's winningest rider scored a $65.40 shocker aboard Ladylore, a
$32,000 claim by trainer Bill Spawr for owner Tom Wafer on March 16,
in the $200,000 Melair Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   The longest shot in the field of eight 3-year-old fillies,
Ladylore won by 11/2 lengths over 7-5 favorite Super High in 1:444/5
for the 11/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Delahoussaye also had two victories, taking the $100,000
Quicken Tree Stakes with favored Adminniestrator and the $175,000
Khaled Stakes with the ageless Native Desert.</TE>
<TE>   In beating stubborn pacesetter Hugh Hefner by a head in 1:414/5
for the 11/16 miles on turf, Native Desert became only the second
9-year-old to win a stakes at Hollywood Park. The other was John
Henry, who captured the 1984 Hollywood Invitational Turf Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   It was the 20th career victory for Native Desert, who has earned
$1,705,586.</TE>
<TE>   Victor Espinoza, Hollywood Park's leading rider after the first
five days, had three winners, taking the $60,000 Pepper Oaks Farms
Stakes with favored Public Domain, the $150,000 B. Thoughtful with
Favorite Funtime and the $175,000 Fran's Valentine with Smokin'
Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   Favorite Funtime had sentiment on her side in her 11/2-length
victory over 14-1 shot Song Of Summer in the seven-furlong B.
Thoughtful.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old Seeking The Gold mare is owned and was bred by John
and Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm.</TE>
<TE>   John Mabee died Wednesday night, 10 days after suffering his third
stroke in two years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The other Gold Rush winners were Theresa's Year, who took the
$70,000 Lakeview Thoroughbred Farms; Affairintheforest, who posted a
$50.40 surprise in the $70,000 Big Jag and Bear Fan, a 10-1 shot who
made a successful debut in the $60,000 Gourmet Girl.</TE>

<KH>KINGS VS. COLORADO Game 7</KH>
<HD>Rewriting History</HD>
<DH>This Year, Kings Hope Game 7 in Colorado Is Beginning, Not
End</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Last year, in the backs of their minds, it might have been good
enough for the Kings to push the Colorado Avalanche to the brink of
elimination.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, after overcoming a 2-0 deficit to upset the Detroit Red
Wings in the first round, it might have been good enough for the
Kings to erase a 3-1 deficit against the Avalanche and necessitate a
Game 7, only to lose it.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, it might have been good enough to come so close.</LD>
<TE>   But this year, "We're trying to write our own story," defenseman
Aaron Miller said. "We've worked so hard just to get an opportunity
to play in Game 7, and now we've got to take another step and go out
there and win it."</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Kings want a happier ending against the Avalanche.</TE>
<TE>   They again have wiped out a 3-1 deficit, and Game 7 of their
first-round Stanley Cup playoff series will be played tonight in the
Pepsi Center.</TE>
<TE>   Center Bryan Smolinski called it "gut-wrenching" to watch on
television as the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup championship last
June, only a few weeks after the Kings had lost in Game 7 of the
Western Conference semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   This year, almost for the Kings will count for nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't believe in ourselves last year, I don't think, as much
as we do this year," defenseman Mathieu Schneider said. "I think we
were trying to slay a giant last year. This year, we feel that we're
on equal ground....</TE>
<TE>   "This year, we played well against them all season long. And with
the playoff series we had against them last year and the way this
series has gone, we feel that we're just as good a club as they are."</TE>
<TE>   Only 16 of the 190 teams that have lost three of the first four
games of a best-of-seven NHL playoff series, or about 8%, have
rallied to win the series. The other three teams that faced that
situation this month--the Philadelphia Flyers, Phoenix Coyotes and
Chicago Blackhawks--all were eliminated in Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, meanwhile, are trying to repeat their feat of 1989,
when they rallied from a 3-1 deficit to upset the defending Stanley
Cup champions, the Edmonton Oilers, in Wayne Gretzky's first playoff
series with the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   They have won only one of their last nine road games but it was
the most important, their 1-0 overtime victory Thursday night in Game
5.</TE>
<TE>   They won Game 6 on Saturday at Staples Center, 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up nine goals in the first two games, 4-3 and 5-3
losses, they've given up only three in winning three of the last
four, their only loss a 1-0 setback in Game 4. They've killed 16
consecutive penalties, last giving up a power-play goal in the first
period of Game 2. Felix Potvin's goals-against average over the last
four games is 0.75, his save percentage is .972.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy with the way we've played defensively," said center
Jason Allison, whose first-period goal off his right leg sparked
Saturday's victory. "We feel that if we can keep playing the way
we're playing and shut them down, we have a great chance of winning."</TE>
<TE>   Allison suffered hand and leg injuries on the same second-period
play Saturday, getting slashed by Mike Keane a split-second before
behind crunched along the boards by Rob Blake, but he returned and
will be in the lineup tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be able to play," he said. "It's Game 7, the most fun game
of the year."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, however, again will be without injured regulars Adam
Deadmarsh and Philippe Boucher, neither of whom made the trip.</TE>
<TE>   Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley was noncommittal when asked about the
status of Peter Forsberg, who sat out Game 6 because of a leg injury,
but when teammate Joe Sakic was asked if Forsberg would play, he
said, "I believe so."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, the Avalanche broke open a 1-1 game by scoring four
goals in the third period of a 5-1 victory in Game 7 against the
Kings.</TE>
<TE>   This is a new day, however, with a different, more confident King
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think last year we didn't really kind of believe that we
deserved to be where we were," Miller said. "We were playing well,
but it was almost like it was a fluke or a one-time thing, whereas
this year we've focused on where we are all year.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be extremely disappointed if we don't win this game,
whereas last year ... I thought maybe everyone felt that what we'd
done was good enough. This year, we think we deserve to win this
series."</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Since his Chicago Bulls lost in the second round of the 1995
playoffs, Phil Jackson has won 21 consecutive playoff series, the
latest a three-game sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers.</LD>
<LD>   His postseason record since then is 78-22, beginning with the 1996
Bulls, and after Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic finished off
Jackson and Co. the season before.</LD>
<LD>   That's five championship seasons, plus three games.</LD>
<TE>   "It says something about the remarkable teams I've been able to
coach," Jackson said Sunday. "And the successive years that I was
fortunate to pick up a team that was on the verge of winning, to help
them win a championship right away in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Other than that, it's been about players being able to focus,
make adjustments, have some poise and see the final prize, yet keep
their minds on what the present goals are."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker has a sore left knee that has bothered him slightly
for the last two weeks. He said Sunday he will be examined today in
Los Angeles, and that he expected to undergo an MRI exam.</TE>
<TE>   Walker did not play after coming out early in the third quarter,
though he said he was available.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally that time of game we go to Robert [Horry] anyway,"
Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant, at 23, has continued to find places to lead, even for
a veteran team already manned by O'Neal, Rick Fox and Derek Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant often seeks out teammates to be sure they are clear on
concepts and strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing a lot of encouragement, direction, picking up the
responsibility on the court to help players wend their way through
their videotape mistakes ... and telling them how to get through this
thing in the best order," Jackson said. "It's markedly different than
last season, and an acceleration of what he did in the regular
season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If reports that Chris Mullin is soon to become general manager of
the Golden State Warriors prove true, don't be surprised if Mitch
Richmond finishes his career there.</TE>
<TE>   Richmond and Mullin, two-thirds of the memorable Run TMC era in
Golden State, remain close. Richmond, who came to Los Angeles last
summer with the intention of winning a title, probably will leave
after the season, when he becomes a free agent.</TE>
<TE>   By all appearances, the Warriors could use some veteran direction,
and the symmetry of Richmond returning to Golden State would generate
positive publicity for an organization that could use it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 27 of 28 first-round series after taking a
two-games-to-none lead.... Sign in the crowd, held by a 60-ish woman
with short, curly hair: "Shaq is fat."</TE>

<DH>Game 3: Lakers shut down the Trail Blazers' season, 92-91,
and sweep series with Horry's three-point shot from corner in final
seconds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Robert Horry from the corner, again.</LD>
<LD>   If nothing else, on a Sunday afternoon when they felt the first
significant tug of the postseason, when the Portland Trail Blazers
worked up the courage to shove back after two years of cowering and
infighting, the Lakers had Robert Horry.</LD>
<LD>   From the corner.</LD>
<TE>   Again.</TE>
<TE>   Horry's three-point shot fell with 2.1 seconds remaining in the
Trail Blazers' season, his open 22-footer eliminating the Trail
Blazers in three games and continuing the lopsided recent playoff
history between Pacific Division foes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers were 92-91 winners at the Rose Garden, where they came
back from a five-point deficit in the final 39 seconds, and so will
play the winner of the San Antonio-Seattle series, which the Spurs
lead, two games to one.</TE>
<TE>   Horry raised his hand and Shaquille O'Neal pounced on his neck and
Kobe Bryant gleefully shook his fist in an arena that went silent
around them, its basketball team having been swept by the despised
Lakers in consecutive first-round series.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won 19 of 20 playoff games, and few--if any--have
demanded more of them at the end.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked kind of scary there for a moment," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   Horry, the role player who buffs up his game for the playoffs,
stood at the middle of a frantic finish that could have the Trail
Blazers talking to themselves for months.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cash," Bryant said. "He's done it so many times. It is
cash."</TE>
<TE>   Horry shrugged thin shoulders unbecoming of a Western Conference
power forward. Ten days before, he was diagnosed with a hematoma--a
pooling of blood--beneath his abdominal muscles. There was some fear
he would be unable to play. He played 89 minutes in the series. He
made two of eight three-point shots over three games, and was one for
one when they absolutely needed it to avoid Game 4, at this same
arena, on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys on the bench were yelling and then all of a sudden
everything slows down for you," said Horry, who made a similar late
three-point shot from the left side in Game 3 of the NBA Finals last
season, and who routinely makes such shots. "I shot it and made it."</TE>
<TE>   He scored eight points, making only one of four three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine that you forget a guy in the corner who's
done that time and time again," Laker guard Derek Fisher said. "What
makes Robert so valuable is the fact he doesn't care about shots like
that. Today was just another Robert Horry-type day. You don't really
notice him on the stat sheet, and you don't really notice him during
the game. But at the end of the game, he steps up and bites you."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' championship three-peat effort pushed onward when
Bryant drove the right side of the lane as the clock ran down, the
Trail Blazers ahead, 91-89, the Lakers thinking tie, thinking
survival. Ruben Patterson blocked Bryant's path, and Scottie Pippen
drifted off Horry, and Bryant flicked a pass to the right, and Horry
rose up in front of the Trail Blazers' bench.</TE>
<TE>   He leaped and shot at the tail end of an unlikely final minute,
when Rick Fox made a layup, Bryant made a three-point shot and Pippen
made three critical misplays.</TE>
<TE>   In the first 47 minutes leading to their victory, the Lakers
played without the verve of the series' first two games. The Trail
Blazers, so lacking in emotional strength in the early part of the
series, seemed intent on making one last statement, playing one more
game, and perhaps pushing the series back to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 21 points, 11 of them from the free-throw line, and
took only 11 shots. Bryant scored 25 points, but the Trail Blazers
often forced him from the ball. So Fox scored 16 points, and Fisher
scored 11, and Horry did what he does.</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers had 53 rebounds, 16 more than the Lakers, and
had 17 offensive rebounds and 14 more field-goal attempts. They
played to win, and looked the part until Rasheed Wallace missed the
first of two free throws with 17.1 seconds left, and Bryant made his
three-pointer from the top, and Pippen missed the second of two free
throws with 10.8 seconds left, and Horry made his three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   Portland had one final chance, and Wallace got free on the low
block against the 6-foot-1 Fisher, only to have Pippen throw the
inbounds pass away.</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, Bryant laughed and Horry laughed with him, and
the Lakers hugged, because they had done just enough, and the Trail
Blazers had fallen just far enough.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a critical-time player," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said. "We
have to gauge his moments so that he's there on the floor at the end
of halves and end of games so that he can do that."</TE>
<TE>   Tough as it was for Jackson to watch at times, when the Trail
Blazers appeared to be making the plays down the stretch that would
force Game 4, at the end he marveled at what O'Neal, Bryant, Fox,
Horry and Fisher were able to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The symbiotic relationship that those five have on the court
after playing a couple of championships now showed its difference in
there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned about it because they didn't demonstrate that
with three minutes to go or with two minutes to go. It took the
pressure of the game-ending situation to step it up and play the way
they should play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Talk Is Cheap</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have won the last five playoff series against Portland,
though you would never know it by comments the Trail Blazers have
made over the years:</TE>
<TE>   2002</TE>
<TE>   Popping Off: Ruben Patterson, a.k.a "Kobe Stopper," after the
Lakers' 91-79 victory over the Trail Blazers March 29 at Staples
Center: "We should have won the game. We can beat the Lakers. I would
rather meet them in the first round. They are not that good."</TE>
<TE>   Talk Is Cheap: The Lakers were good enough to sweep the Trail
Blazers in the playoffs for a second consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, expect Patterson to proclaim himself as an "Horry
Stopper."</TE>
<TE>   2001</TE>
<TE>   Popping Off: Scottie Pippen, accusing Bryant of exaggerating a rib
injury in a 28-point performance in the Lakers' 106-93 win in Game 1:
"He's trying to be like Mike," said Pippen, alluding to Michael
Jordan leading the Chicago Bulls to a Game 5 victory over the Utah
Jazz in the 1997 NBA Finals despite stomach flu. "He wants to have a
heroic performance. It didn't look to me like he had bruised ribs."</TE>
<TE>   Talk Is Cheap: If Pippen didn't think Bryant had bruised ribs,
then why did he spend more time poking at them than trying to defend
him in Game 2? All that Pippen was left with was a bruised ego after
Bryant scored 25 in a 106-88 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Popping Off II: Pippen, when asked in a TV interview before Game 3
about the prospect of getting swept, remarked, "I'm not ready for it
to be over."</TE>
<TE>   Talk Is Cheap II: Bryant, upon seeing Pippen's big head filling up
the television in the Laker locker room, shouted at the screen:
"You're ... crazy, man. Today's your last day of work." Bryant also
responded with an in-your-face 22-point performance in the Lakers'
series-clinching 99-86 victory.</TE>
<TE>   2000</TE>
<TE>   Popping Off: Pippen, after the Trail Blazers battled back from a
3-1 deficit to force a Game 7 in the Western Conference finals: "The
Lakers are a fragile team right now."</TE>
<TE>   Talk Is Cheap: The Trail Blazers proved fragile in the fourth
quarter, failing to handle a 15-point lead in an 89-84 loss. Their
glass jaw was shattered by Shaquille O'Neal's bring-down-the-house
dunk off a lob from Bryant with less than a minute left. Pippen's
reaction to the biggest collapse in NBA Game 7 history: "I realize
that we sort of made cowards of ourselves in the fourth quarter."</TE>

<HD>Mavericks' Sweep Is Team Effort</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Dallas Mavericks can score, and it doesn't matter where they play
or who's taking the shots.</LD>
<LD>   Dirk Nowitzki scored 28 of his 39 points before halftime and lent
his hot hand to Michael Finley in the second half Sunday, helping the
Mavericks hold off the Minnesota Timberwolves and finish a three-game
sweep with a 115-102 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Finley had 13 of his 30 points in the third quarter and Steve Nash
had 25 points and 11 assists for Dallas, which made 13 of 24
three-point attempts and advanced to the second round for the second
consecutive season and will meet the winner of the Utah-Sacramento
series.</LD>
<TE>   "We're always confident down the stretch," Nash said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got so many shooters, we're bound to make a couple."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks, after winning the first two in Dallas, continued
their impressive play away from home by withstanding a 22-7 run by
Minnesota to start the fourth quarter behind a boisterous Target
Center crowd of 18,795.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas has a league-leading 27-14 record on the road this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just the best thing in the world for us to go through this
kind of atmosphere," Maverick Coach Don Nelson said. "It makes you
mature as a player. The more of these we can get, the better."</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Garnett had 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Wally Szczerbiak
and Anthony Peeler each scored 20 points for the Timberwolves, who
made their sixth consecutive first-round exit from the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota had the league's second-best record at the halfway point
this year but wasted a chance at home-court advantage in the first
round by losing 22 of its last 42.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a good team," Minnesota Coach Flip Saunders said of the
Mavericks. "Everybody was saying you've got to slow the game down,
but what are you going to do--tell Nash, Nowitzki and Finley they're
not allowed to shoot?"</TE>
<TE>   Leading by 18 starting the fourth, Dallas suddenly went cold as
Minnesota pulled within three, 104-101, on a free throw by Garnett
with under three minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Eduardo Najera's rebound and putback after a timeout put the
Mavericks ahead by five, and Szczerbiak missed a three-pointer with
two minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   Nash made a three-point basket on the other end to make it
109-101, and Peeler's pass went right to Finley in the lane on the
next possession.</TE>

<HD>Johnson's First Win Is a Genuine Gasser</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Thanks to a gutsy call by crew chief, he holds
off Busch to win at California Speedway.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kurt Busch showed everybody else that the place to run Sunday in the
Winston Cup stock car race at California Speedway was out front.</LD>
<LD>   Then rookie Chevy driver Jimmie Johnson took that knowledge,
turned it against Busch as two of NASCAR's hottest young guns turned
the NAPA Auto Parts 500-miler into a 28-mile trophy dash, and stole
the victory--his first in only 13 tries--right out from under the
spoiler on Busch's Ford.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, an El Cajon native now living in Mooresville, N.C., beat
Busch out of the pits on the last stop of the race after taking on
gasoline only--Busch's crew changed his right-side tires besides
refueling--then beat the Las Vegas driver on the track as well,
holding off Busch in a gripping finish to what had been largely a
follow-the-leader race before a crowd estimated at 120,000.</LD>
<TE>   "We got caught by taking two tires," a surprised and disappointed
Busch said. "I never would have thought I'd be beaten by gas only."</TE>
<TE>   It hadn't occurred to Johnson, either, but once he got the word
from his crew chief, Chad Knaus, that that was the plan, he fell in
love with it.</TE>
<TE>   "I remembered a pit stop earlier in the race when a few cars had
done that and it worked out great for them," he said. "They got some
track position and were able to do something. So when Chad made the
decision, I smiled because I knew what it was going to do for us. It
was going to get us out in front. I was just hoping that Kurt wasn't
going to do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   No chance.</TE>
<TE>   "We had never taken gas only," Busch said. "We never did think of
the factor of taking gas only. It's tough to swallow, but we're gonna
learn from it."</TE>
<TE>   Even Knaus wasn't sure of his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "Our spotter on the other side of the track was telling us that
everybody else was taking two tires," he said. "Jimmie was coming
down pit road and asking what we were going to do. I made a snap
decision and said, 'Fuel only.'</TE>
<TE>   "As soon as I did, I said to [team owner Rick Hendrick], 'Let me
out of here. I'm going to throw up.'"</TE>
<TE>   Busch, who drives for Jack Rousch, the Ford guru who nearly was
killed in a light-plane crash last weekend in Alabama, had hoped to
present his recuperating car owner a victory and worked hard at
catching the fleeing Johnson, but....</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult to pick up ground on a race car with 30 laps
to go for the win," he said. "When I passed [Ricky Rudd, moving into
second place with three laps left] I found something on the track....
I wish I would have found it four laps earlier. We might have been
able to mess with [Johnson]."</TE>
<TE>   Had it not been for a late-race accident involving the Chevrolets
of Kevin Harvick and Dale Earnhardt Jr., it might well have been
Busch, who led for 102 laps, holding off Johnson for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   They were dueling for the lead, with Busch getting the better of
it, when Harvick's car blew a tire coming out of Turn 4 on Lap 229 of
the 250-lap race over the two-mile, D-shaped track. Harvick's car
piled into the rear of Earnhardt's, which spun, then climbed the
track and hit hard against the outside wall.</TE>
<TE>   Neither driver was seriously injured--Earnhardt was taken to the
infield emergency unit, then left, saying he had a sore ankle--but
the caution flag came out and the pace of the race changed.</TE>
<TE>   When the pits opened, five laps later, the leaders all ducked in,
leaving Bill Elliott's Dodge on the track and in the lead. Busch was
first in but third out, behind Johnson and Rudd, who also had put
right-side rubber on his Ford.</TE>
<TE>   They all fell in behind Elliott, then Johnson and Rudd blew by him
when the green flag flew on Lap 237.</TE>
<TE>   Busch needed two laps to get by Elliott, then needed eight more to
get past Rudd, and by then, there were only four left. Not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a dominant car but we just didn't have a lucky enough pit
strategy at the end," Busch said. "It's .... tough to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   Not for Johnson, who celebrated by doing doughnuts afterward,
blowing his car's engine and transmission in the process.</TE>
<TE>   "There was an awful lot of oil in Victory Lane," he said,
sheepishly.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an incredible day for us," he added. "It's amazing how
long these races are and how much can go on. We had the car to beat
and led for a while and I thought maybe this was going to be our day.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the next set of tires we put on, we were extremely loose. It
took two or three tries to get the car tightened back up. During that
time, my emotions were a little low and I thought, OK, we'd maybe get
a top-five finish.</TE>
<TE>   "The [second-to-last] pit stop, we tightened the car up and [it]
came to life. I ran down the pack in front of us and was racing Kurt
real hard before the caution came out."</TE>
<TE>   Although the victory was Johnson's first, the former motocross and
off-road racer already had enjoyed remarkable success as four-time
champion Jeff Gordon's protege. He sat on the pole for the Daytona
500 in February, only his fourth Winston Cup race, then did it again
last weekend at Talladega, NASCAR's other high-banked superspeedway.
In nine previous races this season, he had finished in the top 10 six
times, and his victory here moved him from sixth to fifth in the
season standings.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, co-owner with Hendrick, engulfed Johnson in a bear hug at
Victory Lane and said, "You rock! I guess we hired the right guy."</TE>
<TE>   Later he said, "I never doubted him. I drove against him in the
Busch series and ... it looked to me that he was getting an awful lot
out of the cars he was driving. So I knew if you put him in good race
cars in Winston Cup, he'd do a great job over here too. You've got to
have the right people behind you and the right car underneath you
[but you've also] got to have the right driver in the seat, and he's
certainly the right guy. This is just the first step."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, defending Winston Cup champion, finished 16th and said he
didn't know until after he'd finished that Johnson had won.</TE>
<TE>   "I had enough guys running over me those last laps to keep me very
busy," he said.</TE>

<HD>Thorpe Beats His Buddy in a Playoff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Thorpe rolled in a five-foot birdie putt on the first playoff
hole Sunday to win the Countrywide Tradition at Superstition
Mountain, Ariz., over his cigar-smoking buddy John Jacobs, who missed
a three-footer that would have forced another hole of play.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a wonderful finish," Thorpe said. "If this doesn't help
the golf ratings, I don't know what will."</LD>
<LD>   Thorpe, 53, won his first major on the Senior PGA Tour, and he can
thank the par-five, 553-yard 18th hole on the Prospector course at
Superstition Mountain Golf &amp; Country Club.</LD>
<TE>   Thorpe chipped in from the bunker for an eagle to pull within a
shot of Jacobs for the third-round lead Saturday, then forced the
playoff with a birdie on the 18th Sunday after an approach shot that
landed 18 inches from the pin.</TE>
<TE>   "That hole was very kind to me," Thorpe said. "They should put my
name someplace out there."</TE>
<TE>   The two outgoing players, who often chat with people in the crowd
and joke with each other, finished at 11-under-par 277. Thorpe
finished with a 70, and Jacobs had a 71.</TE>
<TE>   "We both have plenty of money, but we had fun out there," Jacobs
said. "That's what this tour should be about."</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Summerhays shot a 68, but missed a five-foot birdie putt
that would have tied him for the lead on the 18th. He tied for third
with Bob Gilder at 10-under 278.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rocco Mediate, battling 30 mph wind gusts, shot a one-under 71 for
a three-stroke victory over Mark Calcavecchia in the Greater
Greensboro Chrysler Classic at Greensboro, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Mediate finished with a 16-under 272 total for his fifth victory
on the PGA Tour and first since the 2000 Buick Open. He also won at
Forest Oaks Country Club in 1993, beating Steve Elkington in a
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   The $684,000 top prize boosts Mediate's 2002 earnings to $1.487
million and moves him from 21st to sixth on the money list. His total
is a career high, topping last year's $1.474 million.</TE>
<TE>   Calcavecchia, who shot a 72, finished second despite matching the
tour record for fewest putts in a 72-hole event. Kenny Knox also had
93 in the 1989 MCI Heritage Classic.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Byrd shot a final-round 66 to tie for third with Chad
Campbell at 10 under. It was Byrd's best showing in 14 career events.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Michael Schumacher's 57th career Formula One victory was among his
easiest.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher led from start to finish, pulling away at one second
per lap on the high-speed turns of the Circuit de Catalunya in
Barcelona, Spain, to win his second consecutive Spanish Grand Prix.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the fourth in five races this season for
Schumacher, who seemingly could have lapped the field. It also was
his 16th win in the last 25 races and moved him close to clinching a
fifth title before the season is half over.</TE>
<TE>   He already has 44 points, nearly double that of Juan Pablo Montoya
(23). Montoya's BMW-Williams teammate, Ralf Schumacher, is third with
20 points, and McLaren's David Coulthard (9) is fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, closing in on Juan Manuel Fangio's record of five
season titles, slowed after his pit stop on the 47th lap to avoid
tangling with traffic over the final 18 laps.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya was second, 35.6 seconds behind Schumacher, and was
followed by Coulthard (42.6 seconds), Nick Heidfeld of Sauber, Felipe
Massa of Sauber and Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Arrows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whit Bazemore raced to his first Funny Car victory of the year,
beating Gary Densham in the NHRA Mac Tools Nationals at Bristol,
Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Bazemore picked up the 11th win of his career, driving a Pontiac
Firebird to a 4.936-second run at 310.27 mph. Densham finished in
6.400 at 141.67 in a Ford Mustang.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon beat Darrell Russell for his fourth Top Fuel victory
of the season. Dixon had a run of 4.644 at 317.87 to beat Russell
(4.977, 268.01). Warren Johnson won the Pro Stock division with a
6.986 run at 198.41 to beat Ron Krisher (6.975, 198.15).</TE>
<TE>   Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Sweden and the Czech Republic bounced back from early 1-0 deficits
against huge underdogs to remain unbeaten at the World Hockey
Championships.</TE>
<TE>   Sweden fell behind with only 1:41 gone when Solvenia's Marcel
Rodman converted a power-play goal but came back to win, 8-2, at
Karlstad, Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   The Czechs, winner of three consecutive world titles, rallied to
beat Japan, 5-3, at Jonkoping, Sweden, as Jaromir Jagr scored two
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Jagr, of the Washington Capitals, also had an assist, setting up
Jaroslav Spacek at 7:10 in the third period to break a 3-3 tie. Jagr
then put the game out of reach with his second goal at 14:43.</TE>

<HD>Guerrero Does His Share for Expos</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vladimir Guerrero isn't reading too much into the Montreal Expos'
strong start.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero had his second multihomer game and 15th of his career,
leading the Expos over the St. Louis Cardinals, 5-2, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "I can't pinpoint anything, but we're just playing well and I hope
we continue to do it," Guerrero said.</LD>
<TE>   Guerrero and Lee Stevens hit consecutive homers against Matt
Morris (4-2) during a four-run fourth inning. Guerrero homered again
in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still early," Guerrero said. "There are a lot of games left
with five months to go, and we just have to keep on going out there
and doing the good job we've been doing so far."</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 9,780 came to Olympic Stadium despite a storm that
dropped at least five inches of snow in Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Expos, who lost their previous two games, went 9-4 on their
season-high 13-game home stand, raising their record to 15-10. They
retained a share of the NL East lead with the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero, who homered twice against the Chicago Cubs on April 16,
has 28 runs batted in, one more than the team's previous April
record, which he shared with Henry Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   Tomo Ohka (3-2) gave up two runs and seven hits in 71/3 innings,
matching the longest outing of his career. He struck out a
career-high seven and walked none.</TE>
<TE>   New York 9, Milwaukee 6--After two days of pitching duels at Shea
Stadium, the Mets and Brewers got offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Mo Vaughn's run-scoring double highlighted a six-run rally in the
sixth inning and Jeromy Burnitz homered against his former club,
helping the Mets complete a sweep of the three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   The Brewers finished 0-6 on their trip. They lost the first two
games against the Mets, 1-0 and 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 5, Cincinnati 4--Reggie Sanders and Benito Santiago
homered through a gusting wind at Cinergy Field and the Giants ended
the Reds' seven-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco went 5-7 on its longest trip in three years,
dropping out of first place in the NL West.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Bonds, who was bothered by a sore hamstring and managed only
one homer on the trip, singled, grounded out and walked twice Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds' longest winning streak this season ended with a flash of
anger that emptied the benches.</TE>
<TE>   With the Giants ahead, 4-1, reliever Felix Rodriguez hit Sean
Casey in the back of an arm with his first pitch in the eighth
inning. Casey slammed down his helmet and yelled at Rodriguez,
clearing both dugouts and bullpens. No punches were thrown.</TE>
<TE>   Six pitches later, Adam Dunn homered, cutting the lead to 4-3.
Dunn hit a homer in the ninth against Robb Nen.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Florida 4--Curt Schilling struck out 13 in seven
innings, and Steve Finley, Damian Miller and Mark Grace hit
consecutive home runs in the sixth inning at Miami, helping the
Diamondbacks win their fifth consecutive series.</TE>
<TE>   In a span of nine pitches, Finley, Miller and Grace hit two-out
home runs against rookie Josh Beckett (0-2). The homers turned a 3-2
deficit into a 5-3 lead for the NL West co-leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (5-1) gave up four runs and six hits, including home
runs by Cliff Floyd and Kevin Millar.</TE>
<TE>   Holding on to a one-run lead, he struck out Millar with the bases
loaded to end the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 3-2, San Diego 2-7--The Padres split the doubleheader
at Pittsburgh mostly because Ryan Klesko didn't strand many
runners--and, for a change, because Brian Tollberg didn't put many
runners on.</TE>
<TE>   Tollberg, in danger of being demoted to the minors, held
Pittsburgh to two runs in six-plus innings and the Padres turned a
five-run third inning in the second game into a doubleheader split.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Giles hit a go-ahead triple in the seventh and the
Pirates--held to a run by Ben Howard in his major league
debut--rallied against San Diego's bullpen to win the first game.</TE>
<TE>   Klesko drove in five runs in the second game.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Philadelphia 2--The Rockies remained undefeated under
new Manager Clint Hurdle.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Jennings pitched seven shutout innings and Todd Helton hit a
two-run homer at Coors Field for the Rockies, who had lost five in a
row and were 6-16 before Buddy Bell was fired. Hurdle has won three
in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Atlanta 1--Carlos Hernandez pitched seven shutout
innings and the Astros broke the game open with a four-run eighth
inning at Turner Field.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez (2-0), facing the Braves for the first time, gave up
four hits and one walk, and struck out six. The 22-year-old
left-hander has a 2.28 earned-run average in four starts this season.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Serves Up Four-Star Dish Worth Savoring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>It was a sting of beauty, a burst of wonder, a
leap-off-the-couch-and-</LD>
<LD>   dance-on-the-peanut-shells moment.</LD>
<LD>   Not the shot, silly.</LD>
<TE>   The pass.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry has been making that corner three-pointer for years.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe Bryant has been making that penetrating assist for, what,
weeks?</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers won a mere first-round playoff series against the
Portland Trail Blazers here Sunday with that jumper.</TE>
<TE>   They will win a third consecutive championship with that dish.</TE>
<TE>   While today all of Los Angeles understandably wants to hug
Horry--although we hope not in such a life-threatening manner as
Shaquille O'Neal did--we should save a little love for Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   It's official now, you know.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-three years old, and all grown up.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the inbounds pass from Rick Fox with 10.3 seconds remaining
and his team trailing by two points.</TE>
<TE>   Dribbling down the right side against nemesis Ruben Patterson, the
self-proclaimed "Kobe Stopper."</TE>
<TE>   Dribbling into what becomes a double-team with one of the best
defensive players in league history, Scottie Pippen.</TE>
<TE>   Dribbling into a big moment, a heroic moment, a Kobe moment.</TE>
<TE>   Then passing that moment to the open man.</TE>
<TE>   The amazing thing wasn't that Horry made the jumper with 2.1
seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The amazing thing was that he didn't faint first.</TE>
<TE>   Said Horry: "Last year Kobe wouldn't have made that pass. He
believed in himself more than his team. But all this year, he's
changed."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bryant: "Just maturity. Just growth."</TE>
<TE>   Said Horry, laughing: "I still hoped I would get it. I mean,
sometimes Kobe gets that extra jumping ability and just jumps over
people."</TE>
<TE>   Not this season. Not this series.</TE>
<TE>   In leading the Lakers to a three-game sweep despite shooting only
35%, Bryant leaped only over the belief that if he's not scoring,
he's not contributing.</TE>
<TE>   He either led the team, or was tied for the lead, in
three-pointers, free throws, assists, steals and blocked shots.</TE>
<TE>   In the old news department, tales of Bryant's selfishness are now
matched by descriptions of his afro.</TE>
<TE>   He's simply not that guy anymore.</TE>
<TE>   He now understands the pleasures of watching someone else present
his handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an incredible feeling, watching that ball in the air," he
said of Horry's shot. "I was like, 'Go in! Go in!' ... It was like it
was in slow motion."</TE>
<TE>   He now appreciates how his teammates gladly pay him back, witness
O'Neal's monster pick that set him free for the three-pointer that
set up that final play.</TE>
<TE>   "A beautiful pick," he said, as if describing a painting. "I was
wide open."</TE>
<TE>   He now understands that only by sacrificing himself can he find
himself.</TE>
<TE>   And all that other Phil Jackson gobbledygook.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, I realized I had to try to make my teammates better,
that was a weakness," Bryant said. "Like any weakness, I worked on
it."</TE>
<TE>   And now that weakness has become a strength, one that the Lakers
are admiring and displaying like a shiny new trinket.</TE>
<TE>   "This shows his maturity, it's been like this all year," Brian
Shaw said. "He doesn't force things anymore. He trusts us now. You
saw today, he trusted Robert."</TE>
<TE>   Something Pippen will never forget.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe is a great player, and great players make great plays, and
that's what he did," acknowledged the suckered star. "He believed in
his teammates."</TE>
<TE>   And, wouldn't you know it, the kid is finally achieving the
results he sought all along.</TE>
<TE>   He is not this team's most dominant player but, slowly, carefully,
particularly now, he has become its leader.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson talked about it before the game, noting how Bryant helps
the other players decipher the video, work the practice floor, find
their game faces.</TE>
<TE>   "It's markedly different from last year, but an acceleration from
what he was doing this season," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   And to watch him make the game-winning pass when he could have
forced up a game-tying shot?</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he had already seen it in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "During the course of the game, we made eye contact, and I told
him I thought he was pushing it," Jackson said. "He said he would be
all right. I told him his decisions were not all right.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'll get better.'"</TE>
<TE>   So he did. And so did the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   And so when it was finished Sunday, nobody shouted louder or
pumped his fist higher than a guy who did not make the winning shot,
Kobe Bryant running off the cluttered floor, glaring into the stunned
crowd, the two-time defending champions following him.</TE>

<HD>Youngsters Stick Their Necks Out</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Veteran drivers are being passed by brash
newcomers, who aren't afraid to try something different.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is how powerfully the youth wave is cresting in NASCAR: Sunday,
a second-year team dominated the NAPA 500, but then was beaten by the
fresher, more aggressive thinking of a first-year team.</LD>
<LD>   Kurt Busch is 23, with not quite one and a half Winston Cup
seasons under his belt. But he said this as if several decades' worth
of savvy had been swept out from under him: "I never would have
thought I'd be beaten by gas only."</LD>
<LD>   He meant the split-second judgment in Jimmie Johnson's pits, by a
crew chief too new on his job to mull for a moment, to take no tires
on the final stop.</LD>
<TE>   Busch had thought his two-tire stop was an aggressive-enough
gamble to win. "I believed in my heart that the strategy [his
teammate Matt] Kenseth used to win Texas would work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But that was three weeks ago. Only in the computer industry is
three-week-old wisdom more archaic than it is in today's NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   Busch was stunned at what he saw: Johnson had gotten out of the
pits first. That two veterans were intermingled with the young
duelists was irrelevant. They were sitting ducks. Bill Elliott led,
Johnson was second, Ricky Rudd third and Busch fourth.</TE>
<TE>   That the fearless youths would blow off the old guys was a given
in today's NASCAR. Rudd delayed Busch's move into second just long
enough for Johnson, 26, to get away clean.</TE>
<TE>   Rudd, 45, was less than gracious about it afterward.</TE>
<TE>   As for just what it is about these kids, he said, "I think you've
got to look at the equipment they're sitting in.... They're jumping
into the race cars with great people [engineers and crewmen] around
them."</TE>
<TE>   "I get real tired of hearing that," said a co-owner of Johnson's
team, one Jeff Gordon, who at 30 is now the elder statesman of the
complete makeover of NASCAR racing into a high-tech, more polished,
far less southern realm. "Everyone's got good equipment these days."</TE>
<TE>   Sponsorships that allow drivers to run on $20 million to $30
million a year, each, have assured that.</TE>
<TE>   So, money and engineering being equal, Rudd and others in the old
guard remain in denial that the kids are very, very good, and
thoroughly fearless.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't know any better," Gordon cracked. "They haven't hit
things as hard as the rest of us have."</TE>
<TE>   While it is true that Johnson's team is an arm of the Hendrick
Motorsports armada, and Busch's part of the Roush Racing stable,
their units are still in the formative stages.</TE>
<TE>   In Johnson's pits, Chad Knaus had knocked about as a crew chief
with lesser teams previously, but this is his first year running a
top-flight team. So Sunday he was new to the crucial call, for all or
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Under the final caution, "I watched the others coming in, watched
what they were doing," he said. "Seemed like most were taking two
tires, so I just blurted out 'gas only' [on the team's radio
channel.]</TE>
<TE>   "After I made the call and we made the stop, I felt like I needed
to go somewhere and throw up."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson himself was in fact a major gamble on the part of Gordon
and team patriarch Rick Hendrick, who saw raw talent and played a
hunch. He's reached a ripe old 26 because he had to struggle up
through the Busch series, NASCAR's answer to triple-A baseball, until
Gordon noticed last year that "he seemed to be getting more out of
his car than it was capable of."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's lack of record didn't equate with lack of talent, so
Gordon and Hendrick signed him last summer. "We didn't have a
sponsor, didn't even have a team for him, didn't have anything,"
Gordon said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon's role was wooing a sponsor by convincing corporate brass
that Johnson could win, and quickly. Executives of the Lowe's home
improvement chain figured if Jeff Gordon, NASCAR's winningest active
driver, believed in Johnson, that was good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson responded right out of the box, winning the pole for this
year's Daytona 500. But the intricacies of restrictor-plate racing,
and the fickle draft at Daytona, were beyond his experience.</TE>
<TE>   But as the season has settled into what drivers call the "real
racing," on the tracks where plates aren't used, Johnson has looked
better and better, until....</TE>
<TE>   His victory Sunday was no surprise at all, just the next logical
step for him. The only effervescent thing about it was that it came
at his "home track," California Speedway. He's from El Cajon, a San
Diego suburb.</TE>
<TE>   After Gordon finished 16th with an ill-handling car Sunday, his
own crew chief, Robbie Loomis, considered switching to the sort of
chassis setup the fresh thinking of the Johnson-Knaus unit has
produced.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you get set in your old ways," Gordon said. "You get
comfortable with a certain spring or shock, and you don't want to
change. That's why I wanted Jimmie on our team. I knew I'd be able to
learn from him, as well as him learning from me."</TE>
<TE>   Does Johnson remind Gordon of anyone else a few years ago? Gordon
wouldn't bite. "To say he reminds me of me," Gordon said, "would be a
compliment to me."</TE>

<LD>King Coach Andy Murray was contrite Sunday about his late-game and
postgame verbal sparring with Colorado Avalanche Coach Bob Hartley on
Saturday. Not that it happened, but that it distracted from the
Kings' 3-1 victory.</LD>
<LD>   "I told our team this morning," he said, "that if the exchange did
anything to decrease the spotlight on their efforts or the courage
they showed in the hockey game, then I felt bad about it."</LD>
<LD>   He also said that, in the same situation again, he'd react the
same way. He objected to Hartley's insertion of a thuggish lineup
into the closing seconds of a game that already had been decided.</LD>
<TE>   "I've always believed that the three most important things in the
game are, you always respect the game, you always respect your own
players and you always respect your opponent," Murray said. "And I
felt that was twice in this series that that scenario had come up and
those things had been disregarded."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray may have gone out on a limb and guaranteed a Game 6 victory
for the Kings, but he wasn't the only one feeling confident.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like we were definitely going to win," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said Sunday. "We got off to a great start [by scoring two
goals in the first 6 minutes 44 seconds]. That's what we have to do
tomorrow night.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a much better team when we play with the lead. Against that
team in particular, you have to get the lead. It's very important to
get the lead and make them take chances, make them make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   In 13 playoff games between the Kings and Avalanche over the last
two seasons, the team that has scored first has won every time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   King veteran Kelly Buchberger played on the Edmonton Oiler team
that squandered a 3-1 series lead and lost a first-round series
against the Kings in 1989. In 1998, he was on the winning side as the
Oilers overcame a 3-1 deficit to eliminate the Avalanche in the first
round.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that we were done after we were down, 3-1, but we knew
that we were still in every game and we found a way to win," he said.
"It was just one of those things where we kept believing we could do
it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same mind-set here. Guys really believe we can beat
them, and when you have that focus and that mind-set, you're going to
have a good result. But then again, we're playing the Stanley Cup
champions and they know how to win."</TE>

<HD>Crash Shakes Up Earnhardt</HD>

<LD>Banged and bruised, Dale Earnhardt Jr. left California Speedway on
crutches after the nastiest accident of the NAPA Auto Parts 500 on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The race's only two-car crash also involved Kevin Harvick.</LD>
<LD>   "I hit hard as hell, and you know about as much as I do about the
rest of it," Earnhardt said after Harvick blew a tire while running
on the outside and veered into Earnhardt in Turn 4. The contact spun
Earnhardt in front of Harvick and both hit the outside retaining wall
with the front of their Chevrolets.</LD>
<TE>   The left front of Earnhardt's car slammed into the wall. He had
the wind knocked out of him and his right ankle was "swollen and
bruised," he said. "It's as hard as I've ever hit the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Harvick, who completed 226 of 250 laps, finished 35th and
Earnhardt, who completed 225, finished 36th.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Gordon the owner had the winning driver of the race, Jimmie
Johnson, but Gordon the driver had some rotten luck.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time Winston Cup champion started 17th, but spent most of
the day in the top 10 trying for his first win of the season. He was
in fifth place when he pitted under green on Lap 188 and exited in
12th place, one lap behind Kurt Busch.</TE>
<TE>   No problem, except on Lap 189, Jeremy Mayfield blew an engine,
bringing out a caution flag. The leaders pitted under yellow, and
Gordon was unable to get back on the lead lap.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon, who has won twice at California Speedway, still wound up
at the post-race news conference alongside his driver, Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time I've ever been in this room after finishing
16th," Gordon said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For the sixth year in a row, the pole-sitter failed to win. Rookie
Ryan Newman, who set a Winston Cup track record in qualifying, led
only three laps, 2 through 4. By Lap 16, he dropped to 10th, and he
finished 14th, a lap behind the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we had a really good car," Newman said, "but at times we
were the worst car on the track."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ken Schrader finished last when his Pontiac blew an engine after
four laps.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a great car for eight of the 10 races this year, but
the best we have to show for it is 22nd," Schrader said.</TE>
<TE>   "Every now and then, a piece of metal is going to break."</TE>
<TE>   Which piece?</TE>
<TE>   "One of those important pieces that goes real fast."</TE>

<LD>   Questionable hits by the Maple Leafs in Game 5 left Kenny Jonsson
sidelined indefinitely with a concussion and Michael Peca out at
least six months with a torn ligament in his knee.</LD>

<HD>Grilli Wins Pac-10 Singles Title</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rodrigo Grilli didn't draw any hearts on the tennis court, but he had
a large, boisterous rooting section and won some more fans with his
play in the Pacific 10 Conference individual championships.</LD>
<LD>   Grilli, a UCLA junior from Sao Paulo, Brazil, did a fair imitation
of his countryman and favorite player, Gustavo Kuerten, in an
artistic 6-4, 6-3 victory over Washington freshman Alex Vlaski in the
men's singles championship match played Sunday in conjunction with
the 102nd Ojai Valley tennis tournament at Libbey Park in Ojai.</LD>
<LD>   Grilli, ranked No. 48 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Assn., showed
excellent quickness, good court coverage and an array of passing
shots, soft volleys and serves with power and precision. His
supporters in the crowd of about 2,500 even referred to him by
Kuerten's nickname, urging Grilli on with shouts of "Go, Guga!"
Grilli appreciated the support.</LD>
<TE>   "I love it here. It has been an amazing experience, a great week,"
said Grilli, who has had a couple other ones in Ojai. He won the
community college men's singles division the last two years while
playing for College of the Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "Rodrigo never has the same game plan two games in a row, and just
when you think you've got him figured out, he does something else,"
said UCLA Coach Billy Martin.</TE>
<TE>   USC junior Jewel Peterson, ranked seventh, struggled with her
groundstrokes and lost to Stanford senior Gabriela Lastra, 6-3, 6-3,
in the Pac-10 women's singles title match.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Jean-Julien Rojer and Marcin Matkowski defeated Scott
Lipsky and David Martin of Stanford, 9-7, to win the men's doubles.
California's Raquel Kops-Jones and Christina Fusano beat UCLA's Megan
Bradley and Lauren Fisher, 8-6, to win the women's doubles.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Jeschke of Montecito beat Mark Ellis of Ventura, 6-3, 5-7,
6-4, to win his second consecutive men's open singles title and Dina
McBride of Woodland Hills won the women's open division for the
second year in a row. She and Tracie Currie won the doubles title for
the third consecutive time.</TE>

<LD>As the United States prepares for the 2002 World Cup, its fourth
appearance in a row after an absence of 40 years, it is clear our
soccer media still are woefully behind the times, hopelessly
unsophisticated.</LD>
<LD>   Here, the media concerns are mundane: Who will Coach Bruce Arena
start at goalkeeper? Is there a competent left back in the house?
Will we win a game this time?</LD>
<LD>   As opposed to the World Cup buildup in England, Home of Football,
where newspapers, television and radio are focused precisely where
they should be, covering the stories and issues that absolutely need
to be covered.</LD>
<TE>   They would be, in no particular order of significance:</TE>
<TE>   Did England captain David Beckham conceive his soon-to-be
second-born child during a goal celebration, or something like it,
with wife Posh Spice on the field inside Manchester United's home
stadium, Old Trafford?</TE>
<TE>   (Posh strongly denies this rumor, as well as the one that had the
Beckhams naming the child young Trafford.)</TE>
<TE>   How much of the country will use the front page of the Sun as a
prayer mat and enlist the help of the Great Physio In The Sky to heal
Beckham's broken foot in time for England's June 2 World Cup opener?</TE>
<TE>   (According to reliable media reports, Beckham did not break his
foot while conceiving his soon-to-be second-born child at Old
Trafford.)</TE>
<TE>   When will England Manager Sven Goran Eriksson, in obvious need of
stress release while his best player sits idly on the disabled list,
make his final and most crucial selection: longtime girlfriend Nancy
Dell'Olio, the proven Italian veteran, or BBC-TV presenter Ulrika
Jonsson, the dangerous newcomer from Sweden?</TE>
<TE>   And what do Tony Blair and the queen have to say about the squad's
preparations for the big tournament?</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the London tabloid the Sun printed a near life-size
photo of Beckham's left foot on its cover and asked readers to "rub
the photo at high noon on Sunday and pray" that the injury would heal
before the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   That's an essential difference between the media here and in
England. Shaquille O'Neal has a nagging foot injury that is no less
important to the Lakers than Beckham's broken foot is to England. But
have you seen a life-size photo of Shaq's foot plastered across the
front page of this section? Of course you haven't. Shaq's foot is way
too big.</TE>
<TE>   Last week at a media reception at Buckingham Palace, the editor of
the Daily Mirror asked Queen Elizabeth II about the Beckham crisis.
The queen said she realized the midfielder's recovery was "very
important for the country," while adding she was distressed about the
news that Beckham had crashed his Mercedes while attempting to drive
with the broken foot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know enough about stress fractures to go into any
detail," the queen said, "but I do know he is not doing the right
things to get it fixed."</TE>
<TE>   This was two weeks after Prime Minister Blair first addressed the
Beckham crisis in a statement that read: "Nothing [is] more important
to England's arrangements for the World Cup than the state of David
Beckham's foot."</TE>
<TE>   Beckham was not hurt in the crash, which was promptly and
thoroughly investigated by the papers. It was quickly divulged that
the Mercedes was indeed an automatic, meaning Beckham hadn't been
using his left foot, meaning Beckham hadn't been foolishly toying
with England's chances of qualifying for the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the queen offered Beckham advice, and some help, suggesting
that her granddaughter Zara, a physical therapist, might be able to
help speed the player's rehab.</TE>
<TE>   "I very much hope he is fit enough for the World Cup," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Beckham affair would have ground the entire country to a
paralytic halt, were it not for the Eriksson affair.</TE>
<TE>   "SVENSATIONAL" cried the Mirror as it weighed in with the latest
about Eriksson, the first non-Englishman to coach England's national
soccer team. That in itself was considered sacrilege throughout the
country--until Eriksson salvaged a struggling qualification campaign
with five consecutive victories, including 5-1 over Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a different Eriksson debate began to rage: knighthood ... or
sainthood?</TE>
<TE>   This just in: Scratch sainthood. Or, as the News of the World
delicately worded it:</TE>
<TE>   "NANNY CAUGHT SVEN AT IT WITH ULRIKA."</TE>
<TE>   Well, well. And what were our papers reporting about our soccer
coach at precisely the same time?</TE>
<TE>   "ARENA NAMES MEOLA NO. 3 KEEPER."</TE>
<TE>   Soccer and sex are national obsessions in England, and the
Eriksson-Ulrika-Nancy story, as they say in the newsroom, had it all:
Eriksson, the Swedish import who saved English soccer, indulging in
the fruits of victory with Jonsson, the host of a BBC game show
called (no kidding) "Dog Eat Dog," much to the dismay of Dell'Olio,
who is Eriksson's live-in girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   "They were romping naked in the middle of the day," the News of
the World announced, basing its report on an interview with the
boyfriend of Jonsson's nanny--a source close to a source who makes
lunch for the kids of a source close to the source of all this
tabloid hysteria, in other words. The paper quoted the nanny's
boyfriend saying Eriksson had devised a do-not-disturb "code" during
visits to Jonsson's home that involved placing his shoes outside the
closed bedroom door.</TE>
<TE>   This made sense, seeing as how Eriksson probably wouldn't want
anyone barging in while he was explaining to Jonsson the merits of
the flat back four defense over the sweeper system. Nevertheless, the
revelation that Eriksson's shoes had "thick soles to make him look
taller" was embarrassing.</TE>
<TE>   With England's World Cup future at stake, Jonsson decided to take
one for the team, issuing a statement late in the week that she had
ended her relationship with Eriksson. Eriksson faced the media
barrage in a news conference where he dismissed rumors he would
resign after the World Cup because of the controversy, and smoothly
disarmed the mob by flattering them.</TE>
<TE>   "I was used to [media scrutiny] in Italy," Eriksson told his
audience. "I thought I had a very good school there."</TE>
<TE>   Eriksson smiled, looked the room over and divulged what he now
knows. Italy was tough, he said, but compared to the education he has
received the last few weeks, "it was just kindergarten."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Lovett's classroom-based efforts brings success
to Walnut Southlands Christian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wayne Lovett has transformed the Walnut Southlands Christian High
baseball team from laughingstock to league leader in only two seasons
by instructing his players to talk hitting in Algebra and pitching in
U.S. history.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that Lovett wants his players to disrupt their classes;
he just wants them to locate a few more prospective teammates.</LD>
<LD>   When Lovett took over the Southlands program before the 2001
season, only two students attended tryouts for a team that went 1-12
the previous year and would have made an excellent candidate for
contraction. Lovett considered canceling the season. Instead, he had
his players scour every classroom at the coed school of about 75
students in search of anyone who might possess an interest in joining
the team. The Eagles ended up with 11 players, eight of whom had
never played the sport.</LD>
<TE>   "When they heard 'varsity baseball,' they're like, 'We can't play
baseball, we're not very good,'" Lovett said. "We told them we would
teach them. That's how we got our kids."</TE>
<TE>   And thanks to Lovett's tutelage, the kids have been all right.</TE>
<TE>   They finished last season 7-6, going 6-4 in the Express League,
and made a rare playoff appearance. The Eagles (11-5, 8-0) could be
headed for even greater heights this season with a roster of 14
players as they prepare for the Southern Section Division VI
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the increased confidence level of the boys has really
helped them," Lovett said. "They know they can compete, and they have
higher expectations of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Lovett, who works in law enforcement, was drawn to Southlands by
the presence of his stepson, infielder Steven Sanchez, and an
opportunity to "take something that was kind of misshapen and mold it
like a little piece of art."</TE>
<TE>   The coach doesn't stress winning with his players.</TE>
<TE>   "We work on the little things, the fundamentals. Like basically
working on how to catch right, throw right," said sophomore pitcher
Nick Roark, who improved to 7-0 Friday by striking out 11 batters
over five innings in a victory over Silverado St. Michael's Prep.</TE>
<TE>   "He tries to minimize our strikeouts and errors. We just focus on
that and have been doing wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Southlands' improvement has been evident in more ways than its
won-loss record. Last year, Lovett had to simplify the game by
instituting only two or three signs. Now they use more than 20.</TE>
<TE>   But Lovett's true genius may be in the way he builds his roster.</TE>
<TE>   "We tell [students] to come check it out," senior center fielder
Ronnie Rivera said. "But we want people to play because they have a
love for the game, not because we tell them to."</TE>

<HD>Iverson Has All the Answers for 76ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Allen Iverson was a franchise player on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   After being challenged by his coach to take responsibility for
winning and losing, Iverson scored 42 points, including 11 of
Philadelphia's last 15, as the 76ers avoided elimination with a
108-103 victory over the Boston Celtics.</LD>
<LD>   Game 4 of the best-of-five first-round series is Wednesday night
at Philadelphia. Boston leads the defending Eastern Conference
champions, 2-1.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not about being a franchise player. All of my teammates are
franchise players. Why not? I don't want to put myself above nobody
on my squad," Iverson said two days after he deflected blame for
Philadelphia's two losses by insisting he isn't a franchise player
and shouldn't be singled out.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a teammate, I'm a player on the 76ers team and that's that.
But I do feel like I'm the best player and I'm the captain, so
responsibility does come with that."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce had 29 points for Boston and Antoine Walker added 27,
including seven three-pointers in the first half. The Celtics made 15
of 30 three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Derrick Coleman blocked a three-pointer by Rodney Rogers and
Pierce missed one in the final seconds, before Coleman got the
rebound and clinched the victory with two free throws with 44.5
seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he wasn't the whole team and I laughed," 76er Coach Larry
Brown said of Iverson. "I talked to him and I knew he didn't mean
it."</TE>

<HD>Americans Still Kicking in Europe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven players on the United States' World Cup team have been--and in
four cases still are--involved in frantic championship or relegation
fights in England, France, Germany and the Netherlands as the
European season draws to a close.</LD>
<LD>   In England, U.S. goalkeepers Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel,
battling for the starting spot at Korea/Japan '02, both made an
impact over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Keller shut out Liverpool, 1-0, in his sixth consecutive start for
Tottenham Hotspur to all but end Liverpool's hopes of winning the
Premier League title.</LD>
<TE>   Friedel, meanwhile, helped the Blackburn Rovers celebrate their
survival at the top level of English soccer with a 2-1 victory Sunday
over Everton, the home team of another U.S. World Cup player, Joe-Max
Moore. Blackburn and Everton, which both had been flirting with
relegation most of the season, managed to avoid the drop when other
results went their way Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Friedel has started all 36 of Blackburn's league games this season
and also was a key to Rovers' League Cup triumph.</TE>
<TE>   For U.S. captain Claudio Reyna, however, the fight goes on. Reyna
will not be able to join the American team when it opens camp in
Cary, N.C., on Wednesday because his English club, Sunderland, was
held to a 2-2 tie at Charlton Athletic on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   That means Sunderland has to at least tie its final game, at home
against Derby County on May 11, or hope that Ipswich ties or loses
its final match, to avoid being one of three Premier League teams
demoted to the first division.</TE>
<TE>   Because of that, Reyna, signed by Sunderland from Rangers of
Scotland for more than $6 million, probably will not be playing for
the U.S. against Uruguay in Washington May 12.</TE>
<TE>   Also battling relegation, this time in France, is U.S. defender
David Regis, whose FC Metz team lost, 2-0, to Paris St Germain on
Saturday and is engaged in a desperately close contest with Guingamp
and Lorient to see which two of the three teams drop from the French
first division to the second division. All three have one game left.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, Bayer Leverkusen, the home of U.S. defender Frankie
Hejduk, was poised to win the Bundesliga title, but consecutive
losses to Werder Bremen and FC Nurnberg have all but scuttled that
hope.</TE>
<TE>   Leverkusen, which has finished as Bundesliga runner-up three times
in the last five seasons, was knocked out of first place by Borussia
Dortmund over the weekend and no longer controls its future. If
Dortmund wins Saturday, it will win the championship.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Leverkusen still has a chance to win the European Champions
League, however. It tied Manchester United, 2-2, in the first game of
a home-and-home semifinal series last week and the second game is in
Germany on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The only American World Cup player almost assured a championship
this European season is midfielder John O'Brien, whose Ajax Amsterdam
team needs only a tie in its final game Saturday to win the Dutch
title for the 28th time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stephane Guivarc'h, a forward on France's 1998 World Cup-winning
team, announced his retirement because of a lingering knee injury.
"My knee cartilage has suffered a lot and I haven't touched a ball
for four months,'' Guivarc'h, 31, said. "Even with time, I won't make
it, so it is better to stop."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 56,000 in Athens on Saturday saw AEK Athens defeat
rival Olympiakos, 2-1, to win the Greek Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Injured England captain David Beckham is confident of being fit
for the World Cup, and British newspapers Sunday quoted his father,
Ted, as saying that the Manchester United midfielder could even be
ready to play in the European Champions League final on May 15 if
United beats Bayer Leverkusen in Tuesday's semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Goals from defender Ivan Cordoba of Colombia and forwards Alvaro
Recoba of Uruguay and Ronaldo of Brazil earned Inter Milan a 3-1
victory over Piacenza at Milan's San Siro stadium Sunday and left it
within one victory of its first Italian Serie A championship in 13
years.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Eliminated From Fed Cup</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kicking Jennifer Capriati off the Fed Cup team probably cost the
United States a chance at the title and led to an embarrassing
first-round defeat to Austria.</LD>
<LD>   The Americans, winners of a record 17 titles, were eliminated
Sunday when Barbara Schwartz upset Fed Cup rookie Meghann
Shaughnessy, the fill-in at No. 1 singles following Capriati's ouster
for not agreeing to a team rule that prohibited her from practicing
on her own.</LD>
<LD>   "They were obviously the underdogs here and a lot of things went
their way from the beginning with Capriati," Shaughnessy said. "I'm
disappointed it came to this, there's no reason why we shouldn't have
had four people here with the same goal in mind."</LD>
<TE>   Schwartz, ranked 75th in the world, followed Saturday's victory
over Monica Seles with a 4-6, 7-6 (7), 9-7 win over Shaughnessy to
give Austria its clinching third win in the best-of-five match.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Roddick outslugged Pete Sampras to defend his title in the
U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship at Houston, rolling to a 7-6 (9),
6-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   The 19-year-old Roddick had 13 aces to 12 for Sampras, who was
trying to win a tournament for the first time since his seventh
Wimbledon title in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Roddick teamed with Mardy Fish to beat Jan-Michael Gambill
and Graydon Oliver, 6-4, 6-4, for the doubles title. Roddick is the
only player on the tour this year to win singles and doubles titles
in the same tournament.</TE>

<LD>Another move toward development of a tennis television package and a
unified summer series of tournaments leading to the U.S. Open was
taken Sunday when it was announced that the U.S. Tennis Assn. and the
Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) signed an agreement toward that
effort.</LD>
<LD>   The new partnership will explore the development of high-profile
U.S. summer events--with a preference of combined tournaments.</LD>
<LD>   AEG, according to the announcement, will look into "the
development and construction of state-of-the-art tennis facilities."</LD>
<TE>   Said Arlen Kantarian, the USTA's chief executive of professional
tennis: "Our partnership with AEG, along with our initiative to
secure a summer-wide television package, will hopefully provide new
resources to help lift the entire sport."</TE>
<TE>   AEG already has started construction on one major facility, in
Carson, which will feature a 13,000-seat tennis stadium. AEG also has
been attempting to lure the men's event at UCLA and the women's event
at Manhattan Beach to its Carson site.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how the new partnership would impact existing U.S.
tournaments, partnership officials characterized the move as "a first
step." No specifics were offered.</TE>
<TE>   "There are clearly next steps to bring, whether it's combined
events or solo events, to these state-of-the art complexes, starting
with Carson," Kantarian said. "It's going to be a new breakthrough
for tennis that will be built brick by brick."</TE>

<HD>Quake Damage Is History at State Park</HD>
<DH>Los Encinos: With building repairs nearly done, Valley site
reopens after 18 months.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loyal Bruno used to cut across what is now Los Encinos State Historic
Park when he attended the nearby elementary school, and swim in the
warm lake fed by a natural spring.</LD>
<LD>   He remembers the weathered adobe that graced the grounds and the
two-story building that looked like it belonged in France, not the
middle of Encino.</LD>
<LD>   Bruno, 66, and other residents were unable to enjoy the park for
18 months while it was closed for repairs and restoration of
buildings damaged in the Northridge earthquake. But the park at 16756
Moorpark St. was reopened Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   Franciscan missionary and explorer Juan Crespi and his party set
up camp by the lakeside in 1769--near what is now Ventura Boulevard
and Balboa Avenue--and met with members of the local 200-strong
Tongva tribe.</TE>
<TE>   The native people were "very fine, well-behaved and very
friendly," Crespi wrote in his journal, noting that all but the chief
were monogamous--he had two wives.</TE>
<TE>   By the time young Bruno splashed in the lake, it had been
reconstructed in the shape of a Spanish guitar and lined with
limestone blocks quarried in the Santa Monica Mountains in the 1870s,
said park Ranger Russell M. Kimura.</TE>
<TE>   Kimura said work on the park's two-story Garnier building and De
la Osa adobe was delayed while state officials negotiated with the
federal government for $1.2 million to restore the buildings and make
them safe.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by an ancestral home in the south of France, the Garnier
building was constructed by the Garnier family, Basque ranchers who
also designed the guitar-shaped lake. Kimura has a makeshift office
in the building, which has served as everything from a bunkhouse to a
brothel.</TE>
<TE>   "This building is made out of small pieces of limestone," Kimura
said. "It's even worse than brickwork [in its vulnerability in a
quake]. It had three gaping holes in it. It looked like somebody had
shot it with a cannon."</TE>
<TE>   Nels Roselund, the Rosemead-based structural engineer who restored
the building, said the job was formidable.</TE>
<TE>   "The north wall was close to collapsing," he said. "It was kind of
scary even getting close to it to start working on it. The way it was
built, it was just a stack of stones mortared together."</TE>
<TE>   He and his crew clamped what remained of the wall together, taking
care to anchor the corners.</TE>
<TE>   For the reopening, Kimura reinstalled a hands-on exhibit in the
Garnier building on the history of the park. It provides a look back
to the site's incarnation in the 1850s as a longhorn cattle ranch and
later as a place where Basque immigrants tended Merino sheep, whose
wool was sold in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Grapevines have been planted next to the building like those that
once grew above the veranda of the De la Osa adobe.</TE>
<TE>   "We were doing tremendous business in the park before the quake,"
said Kimura, a ranger at Los Encinos from 1987 until the park closed.
(He currently recruits rangers for state parks in Southern
California). The shady venue was booked for weddings, film shoots and
other events.</TE>
<TE>   Encino residents were frequent visitors. "Most of them were
mothers, with their kids, feeding the ducks," Kimura said.</TE>
<TE>   Now reduced to five acres, the park is the last remnant of a
4,460-acre rancho given to local Indians in the 1830s. The land was
bought in 1849 by rancher Vicente de la Osa, who built the adobe and
lived in it with his wife and 12 children.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, locals saved the site from development.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration of the adobe is substantially complete, Kimura said,
but it will remain closed until furniture and other damaged artifacts
are restored and a new interpretive program is installed.</TE>
<TE>   After the earthquake, the park staff discovered the remains of
unusual wall decorations from the Garnier period in one room of the
adobe. Frank Preusser, a conservation scientist and consultant in
West Hills, said the painted decorations resemble lozenge-like
picture frames.</TE>
<TE>   Done in black, gray and ocher, the frame-like shapes surround
areas painted to resemble yellow marble. The decorations have been
removed from the walls for restoration and possible reinstallation,
Preusser said.</TE>
<TE>   The adobe is of great historical interest, according to Edna E.
Kimbro, an architectural conservator and historian with the state
Department of Parks and Recreation.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few surviving adobes," Kimbro said. California
once had more than 1,000, but only about 350 remain.</TE>
<TE>   "Any building that survives from that period is enormously
significant," she said, especially given the growing number of
Latinos interested in the state's roots.</TE>
<TE>   William Ginell, a senior conservation scientist at the Getty
Conservation Institute, described the De la Osa adobe's restoration
as a balancing act.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to maintain the authenticity of historic
buildings," he said. "You should do as little as possible that's
required to stabilize the structure and prevent damage."</TE>

<HD>Showcasing the Very Young at Art</HD>
<DH>Education: Thousand Oaks preschool 'commissions' kids to
provide works for a fund-raising auction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget about bringing home messy finger-paintings for parents to
proudly post on the refrigerator.</LD>
<LD>   At Roots and Wings preschool in Thousand Oaks, toddlers intend to
get top dollar for their works of art.</LD>
<LD>   But the little ones won't be making a profit from the "abstract"
paintings and sculptures they have spent the last several weeks
creating.</LD>
<TE>   The money raised in the school's first-ever children's art show
and silent auction next weekend will go back into the center, the
only place in the affluent east county community offering free
preschool for low-income families. Using professional art
supplies--not the newsprint and washable paint of standard preschool
art projects--the youngsters have made colorful paintings, jewelry
boxes and ceramic ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to give children the opportunity to experiment with
real, authentic art media," said Sherri Laboon, executive director of
Roots and Wings City Center. "By putting things on display and
selling them, it really elevates the importance of what they've
done."</TE>
<TE>   At the preschool last week, 4-year-old Savanah Andersen sat at a
pint-sized easel, delicately spreading acrylic paint on stretched
canvas.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the red," she said, admiring her work.</TE>
<TE>   In another room, 2-year-old Brendan Hirano practiced "spin art."
Clutching a purple marker in one tiny hand and pushing a Lazy Susan
with the other, he made a design of concentric circles.</TE>
<TE>   Though art at this age mostly is for fun, it is also critical for
early development, Laboon said.</TE>
<TE>   In handling thin-stemmed paintbrushes, children are learning motor
skills and hand-eye coordination--important precursors to writing.</TE>
<TE>   And no one has been excluded. Even infants, too young to hold a
brush, created art by crawling around a canvas in paint-drenched
mittens, Laboon said.</TE>
<TE>   The preschool serves 111 children, from infants to 4-year-olds,
five days a week.</TE>
<TE>   About 51% of the students are from low- or moderate-income
families, their $650-per-month tuition subsidized by the California
Department of Education. To qualify, a family of four has to earn
less than $36,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The program also is supported by the city of Thousand Oaks, which
provides the school's building on Conejo School Road rent-free and
pays nearly 90% of maintenance costs, said Carol Williams, the city's
director of special projects.</TE>
<TE>   But with rising utility bills and teachers' health insurance
costs, the school's budget for materials has decreased, Laboon said.
Parents helped raise money in the fall to buy art supplies and plan
the show and auction, which Laboon hopes will yield the center at
least $5,000.</TE>
<TE>   The silent auction will include about 100 donated gifts from local
businesses and residents, including a week's vacation in Mammoth and
rounds of golf at local courses.</TE>
<TE>   The children's artwork, priced according to the cost of the
school's materials, will be displayed on the lawn in front of the
Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Parents are eager to help the center by purchasing the
preschoolers' creations.</TE>
<TE>   "I could frame anything my daughter brings home, but do I? No,"
said Jillene Stevenson, whose 3-year-old, Gwynne, has been at Roots
and Wings since she was 4 months old. "I usually put it on the
bulletin board, and then after three months, it probably goes in the
trash. This is going to be special."</TE>

<HD>Helping the Poor in Nicaragua Is 80-Year-Old Activist's Bag</HD>
<DH>Philanthropy: She sends plastic sacks to Central America to
be woven into colorful purses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID KELLY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruth Smith is no mere bag lady--she's a connoisseur of the plastic
sack.</LD>
<LD>   The white-and-blue ones from Wal-Mart and the pink from Mary Kay
cosmetics top her list while the duller, brown bags from chain
grocery stores bring up the rear.</LD>
<LD>   When she collects enough bags, the 80-year-old Camarillo woman
begins snipping them into strips. Weeks later, hands and wrists sore,
she packs them into boxes and sends them to Nicaragua. Local woman
there weave the strips into colorful, heavy-duty purses with zig-zag
designs and intricate patterns.</LD>
<TE>   The purses are returned to Smith, who carts them around in the
trunk of her car, selling them to anyone expressing the remotest
interest. Her hairdresser, exercise classmates and members of her
church have all forked over $15 to $20 for a purse. Smith sends all
the money back to the weavers and, while none have gone from bags to
riches, the extra cash substantially boosts their meager incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "I mailed 12 pounds this week and there were at least a thousand
bags inside," said the energetic Smith, a former Marine, retired
schoolteacher and activist who has been involved in peace movements
around the world for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Smith toured the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War,
visited Hiroshima, attended peace conferences in Honduras and taught
at a coffee cooperative in Nicaragua while the American-supported
Contra rebels were trying to overthrow the Marxist Sandinista
government.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Nicaragua partly because I was so distressed by our
government policy of backing the Contras," she said. "I figured if
there was anything I could do to make up for the problems my country
caused, I would."</TE>
<TE>   Nicaragua's war ended, but Smith's interest in the nation hasn't
waned. She has taught sewing, weaving and crocheting to Nicaraguan
women to help them supplement their incomes.</TE>
<TE>   "Each time I go down, I fall in love with the country all over
again," Smith said. "The men are very macho and the women are often
left to raise the children."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Smith heard of a program in Huntington Beach to
send plastic bags to Nicaragua, and she immediately got involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured if they were given a skill, they could buy, sell and
barter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bags are used because plastic bags in Nicaragua are often
thin and disintegrate easily, Smith said. The weavers make everything
from small purses to large bags with cloth linings. Those made with
red, blue or white plastic bags fetch higher prices than the ones
made with standard light brown grocery bags. When complete, it's hard
to tell that the sturdy purses are gussied-up plastic.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of a $20 purse, said Smith, provides enough to buy
groceries for a weaver and her family for a month.</TE>
<TE>   The women who make the bags live in the mountain city of Jinotega.
Smith, who has been to Nicaragua five times, said they have no
running water or sewers. Their houses are mere shacks jutting
precariously from green hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Smith keeps a box at her church where many of the 150 members have
deposited bags. For her 80th birthday party, she talked people into
purchasing the bags instead of buying her presents.</TE>
<TE>   "She is wonderful, and the project is so important," said Susan
Bronn, chairwoman of the social concerns committee of the Unitarian
Universalist Church in Ventura, which Smith attends.</TE>
<TE>   "The committee and congregation collect the bags she needs and we
give her money to cover the shipping," Bronn said. "I think what she
does is great because all the money she raises goes directly to the
people."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, divorced with four grown children, is originally from
Missouri and came to California after joining the Marines. She ran
the female mess hall at Camp Pendleton during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After getting married she moved to Camarillo, where she taught
reading in the local schools for 27 years. She also traveled the
world as a member of Educators for Social Responsibility, a peace and
social justice activist group.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's home is full of books and artifacts from her travels. Her
walls are covered with pictures of women and children she has met
from Peru to Japan. Nicaragua, however, remains special to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to Nicaragua in 1983 to check out the revolution and I was
so impressed," she said. "They raised the literacy rate, everyone was
getting health care. But the Sandinistas had their problems, because
power tends to corrupt."</TE>
<TE>   She says she will continue collecting bags and trying to make
whatever difference she can.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so satisfying and such a big part of my life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And she may have found some new customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The people at the post office have asked me what I'm selling,"
she said. "They don't have any bags--yet."</TE>

again," Smith said. "The men are very macho and the women are often
left to raise the children."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Smith heard of a program in Huntington Beach to
send plastic bags to Nicaragua, and she immediately got involved.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured if they were given a skill, they could buy, sell and
barter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. bags are used because plastic bags in Nicaragua are often
thin and disintegrate easily, Smith said. The weavers make everything
from small purses to large bags with cloth linings. Some have buttons
and flaps. Those made with red, blue or white plastic bags fetch
higher prices than the ones made with standard light brown grocery
bags. When complete, it's hard to tell that the sturdy purses are
gussied-up plastic.</TE>
<TE>   The sale of a $20 purse, said Smith, provides enough to buy
groceries for a weaver and her family for a month.</TE>
<TE>   The women who make the bags live in the mountain city of Jinotega.
Smith, who has been to Nicaragua five times, said they have no
running water or sewers. Their houses are shacks jutting precariously
from green hillsides.</TE>
<TE>   Smith keeps a box at her church where many of the 150 members have
deposited bags. For her 80th birthday party, she talked people into
purchasing purses instead of buying her presents.</TE>
<TE>   "She is wonderful, and the project is so important," said Susan
Bronn, chairwoman of the social concerns committee of the Unitarian
Universalist Church in Ventura, which Smith attends.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, divorced with four grown children, is originally from
Missouri and came to California after joining the Marines. She ran
the female mess hall at Camp Pendleton during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After getting married she moved to Camarillo, where she taught
reading in the local schools for 27 years. She also traveled the
world as a member of Educators for Social Responsibility, a peace and
social justice activist group.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's home is full of books and artifacts from her travels. Her
walls are covered with pictures of women and children she has met
from Peru to Japan. Nicaragua, however, remains special to her.</TE>
<TE>   She says she will continue collecting bags and trying to make
whatever difference she can.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so satisfying and such a big part of my life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   And she may have found some new customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The people at the post office have asked me what I'm selling,"
she said. "They don't have any bags--yet."</TE>

<HD>Baron Hans Thyssen, 81; Billionaire Art Collector</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza, billionaire industrialist and
man about the world who amassed the finest private art collection
second only to that of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, has died. He was
81.</LD>
<LD>   Thyssen died early Saturday of a heart attack at his home in Sant
Feliu de Guixols north of Barcelona, Spain, according to an
announcement by the Thyssen Museum in Madrid.</LD>
<LD>   The custodian of a three-generation fortune and two-generation
title, Thyssen seemed to enjoy the notoriety that his far-flung
interests generated.</LD>
<TE>   A bona fide jet-setter in the 1960s and '70s, he crisscrossed the
Atlantic to sit on the boards of about 30 corporations, buy art and
court world beauties.</TE>
<TE>   Born to a German father and Hungarian mother, he was a native of
the Netherlands, became a Swiss citizen in 1950, and for tax
advantages lived primarily in Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   He married five women and divorced four--German Princess Teresa of
Lippe, model Nina Dyer of England, model Fiona Campbell-Walker of
Scotland and heiress Liliane Denise Shorto of Brazil. His fifth wife,
the former Miss Spain, Maria del Carmen Rosario "Tita" Cervera
Fernandez, survives and was with him when he died.</TE>
<TE>   The fortune began with Thyssen's grandfather, August Thyssen, the
son of a German pharmacist and founder of a steel mill in the
industrial Ruhr district that made chicken wire and other staples of
the 19th century.</TE>
<TE>   Although August didn't begin the fabled art collection, he enjoyed
art and befriended sculptor Auguste Rodin.</TE>
<TE>   Thyssen's father, also named Heinrich, began the nomadic
meandering, the diversification of business interests and the buying
of Old Masters, which Thyssen would perfect.</TE>
<TE>   The third of August Thyssen's sons, Heinrich immigrated to Hungary
in 1905 and married Baroness Margit Bornemisza de Kaszon, the
daughter of the king's chamberlain. With no sons of his own, the
chamberlain passed his title to his son-in-law, who added Bornemisza
(meaning "doesn't drink wine," a description that never fit Thyssen's
father or son) to his name.</TE>
<TE>   Fleeing communism in Hungary after World War I, he moved the
family to the Netherlands, where Hans Heinrich, or "Heini" as he was
known, was born on April 13, 1921.</TE>
<TE>   Fleeing Nazi influences and the approach of World War II, the
family moved to Switzerland, where the elder Thyssen bought an
18th-century villa near Lugano and named it Villa Favorita. There the
growing art collection would hang for several decades.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, August Thyssen's oldest son and Heini's uncle, Fritz,
who remained in Germany and in the family steel business, became one
of Hitler's earliest and most ardent supporters, providing funds for
the Nazi cause.</TE>
<TE>   He later denounced Hitler and was imprisoned by the Nazis and,
after the war, by the Allies for his changing allegiances.</TE>
<TE>   At his father's death in 1947, Heini Thyssen inherited the title
of baron and his father's love and lust for art, money and women--in
no certain order.</TE>
<TE>   As his father had diversified from steel into banking and
shipping, Thyssen further diversified family business interests to
include glass, plastics, automobile parts and container leasing.</TE>
<TE>   He gradually began to diversify the art collection to include
20th-century works, which his father had famously called "rubbish."
The original collection of more than 400 works, however, had been
divided with Thyssen's two siblings, and he spent 15 years or so
buying it back to keep the collection intact.</TE>
<TE>   Heini Thyssen vastly increased the art collection, adding German
and French Impressionists, fauvists, Russian avant-garde, and
American early art, including works by John Singer Sargent and
Winslow Homer and modern and pop art by such artists as Roy
Lichtenstein and David Hockney. Opening Villa Favorita to the public,
he also lent his paintings generously for exhibits around the world.</TE>
<TE>   "You can lock paintings in a bedroom or on a shelf, but they are
not painted for that purpose," Thyssen told The Times in 1980, when
the nine-city tour of 57 "Old Master Paintings from the Collection of
Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza" stopped at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art.</TE>
<TE>   Annemarie H. Pope, president and founder of the Washington-based
International Exhibitions Foundation, which organized and circulated
the show, described it for The Times then as "about the best of the
100 [exhibitions] we have sent in our 15-year history."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Thyssen's "American Masters: The Thyssen-Bornemisza
Collection," featuring works by John Singleton Copley, Sargent,
Edward Hopper and Georgia O'Keeffe, was exhibited at the San Diego
Museum of Art. In 1985, his "20th Century Masters: The
Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection," featuring works by Picasso and
Kandinsky, was presented at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</TE>
<TE>   Thyssen's $2-billion art trove was sought by governments and
museums around the world, prompting him to joke: "I keep a list of
countries from Albania to Zululand that want my collection."</TE>
<TE>   He was courted locally by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and
the Getty Museum, which reportedly once offered $3.5 billion to buy
his paintings, sculptures and tapestries for its new $1-billion
showcase facility.</TE>
<TE>   Approaching art much as he did business--and angered by
Switzerland's refusal to help pay for displaying the collection at
Lugano--Thyssen ended speculation in 1988 by turning to Spain. He
leased much of his collection to the government of Spain for about $6
million a year with an option to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Despite controversy and anger from art aficionados who felt
Thyssen should donate rather than sell the art, the Spanish
Parliament approved the transaction in 1990 and bought 775 works in
1993 for a bargain-basement price of $350 million.</TE>
<TE>   Thyssen's fifth wife has been credited with persuading him to move
the priceless collection to her native country.</TE>
<TE>   Spain gained further favor by spending $45 million to renovate the
early 19th-century Villahermosa Palace near the Prado Museum in
central Madrid to house most of the works. The remainder of the
purchased art is displayed in a restored monastery outside Barcelona.</TE>
<TE>   John Walsh, the Getty Museum's director at the time Spain acquired
the art, was philosophical about Thyssen's selling rather than giving
away his collection, noting for The Times: "He had to settle [his
financial affairs] with his children, and the largest part of his
assets were tied up with works of art. He is a good businessman who
knows his collection has a large value and that it is not legally
tied to Lugano.... He explored many possibilities to come to an
arrangement with his heirs and to put the collection in a place that
pleased him."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Thyssen settled lengthy and expensive
litigation in Bermuda with his eldest son, Georg, over control of the
$2.7-billion family empire. He had claimed the son, who controls the
Thyssen-Bornemisza Group, failed to pay him about $232 million in
proceeds from the Bermuda-based family trust. The yearlong litigation
cost about $100 million in legal fees.</TE>
<TE>   Thyssen, whose body will be buried in the family mausoleum at
Schloss Landsberg in Germany, is survived by his wife; her son Borja,
whom he adopted; and four children from his first four marriages:
Francesca, Georg, Lorne and Wilfred.</TE>

<HD>Starting to Think Outside the Big Box</HD>
<DH>Government: Regional planning has suffered as cities
compete for mega retail stores and the sales tax revenue they bring.
But a shift is afoot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's how a budget analyst for San Juan Capistrano describes the
Home Depot proposed for a site near downtown:</LD>
<LD>   It's like a big bowl of spinach. The city might not like the
taste, but it's good for them.</LD>
<LD>   Much about the proposal for the home-improvement store has
residents turning up their noses--traffic, pollution and the harm a
city report shows it will cause to small businesses downtown.</LD>
<TE>   Yet City Council members say the windfall in sales taxes that the
mega-size retailer will bring is too enticing to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   It's another case of "cash-box zoning," an unintended side effect
of 1978's landmark Proposition 13 that has become entrenched
statewide. Despite what most planners agree is a glut of "big boxes,"
malls and other retail projects in Southern California, local
officials continue to court mega-stores, seeing them as the only
viable opportunity to generate new revenue when it's extremely
difficult to raise property taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Cities have taken to setting aside as much land as they can for
large retail projects, often at the expense of desperately needed
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Municipalities fight with each other for stores, and approve new
retail centers just across city lines from existing ones, even when
indications are that there will not be enough business for both to
thrive.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created an incentive to chase these big boxes to the
detriment of everything else," said Marlon Boarnet, professor of
regional planning at UC Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get smarter about how we grow as a region."</TE>
<TE>   There is a move in Sacramento to shift sales taxes from cities and
replace the revenue with a regional pool communities would share. The
hope is that by taking away the financial incentive for mega-stores,
cities and counties will practice better planning.</TE>
<TE>   A law approved by the Assembly in January would launch the first
test case in a group of counties around the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Long spurned as an intrusion on home rule, this kind of lawmaking
to address issues regionally is gaining momentum.</TE>
<TE>   Among the loudest advocates is the Speaker's Commission on
Regionalism, a group organized by Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) to identify ways cities can work together to tackle
growth issues.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's final report, released this year, urges a series
of reforms that would "reduce the fiscal incentive for retail."</TE>
<TE>   They include shifting a bigger share of property taxes away from
the state and to the cities, in exchange for cities giving some of
their sales tax revenue to the state.</TE>
<TE>   That would at least provide an incentive to cities to add more
residential zoning, which would bring some relief to the regional
housing crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Many real estate analysts say it's about time.</TE>
<TE>   "Cities are addicted to sales tax," said Larry Kosmont, a Los
Angeles-based real estate consultant. "We have such a convoluted tax
system that it is rational for a city official to say, 'Let's get
this into our community, because if we don't, we lose out,' as
opposed to asking what is the highest and best use for a site.</TE>
<TE>   "Cash-box zoning has driven us into a dry spell when it comes to
housing productivity."</TE>
<TE>   Kosmont said one Home Depot can generate more revenue for a city
than thousands of homes, thanks to Proposition 13's limits on
property taxes. The upshot is that city officials view homes as added
expenses and big-box retailers as new cash streams.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just housing that loses out to the big boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster was so worried about the prospect of losing a Costco
that it gave up some prime parkland to keep the store in town. After
the retailer threatened to flee to neighboring Palmdale--and take the
sales tax revenue with it--Lancaster handed over 4.5 acres inside its
71-acre city park, where the company will remove about 100 trees to
build a 148,000-square-foot store.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress city officials are moving to seize an 18-acre parcel owned
by Cottonwood Christian Church for a Costco--despite parishioners'
protests. Cottonwood bought the land in 1999 to build a sanctuary and
auditorium for its 4,000 members, but the city says a retail center
anchored by Costco is a better use for the busy neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the rush to generate sales tax also has resulted in
the overbuilding of smaller retail centers in many cities. Santa Ana
planners reported in a recent study that they have 40% more strip
malls than traffic can justify on the city's west side.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim planners also are grappling with an overabundance of
stores in parts of their city and are trying to replace some with
affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed state law for the six-county region around Sacramento
would establish the kind of tax-sharing many planners support. Future
growth in local sales taxes would be pooled for cities to share.</TE>
<TE>   The bill has sparked heated opposition from critics who argue that
it's an effort to steer funds away from wealthy suburbs and
redistribute them to less-affluent areas. Even some advocates of
regionalism question whether cities will find the approach too
unpalatable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm skeptical of having the state swooping up a locally levied
tax and redistributing it," said Fred Silva, senior advisor at the
Public Policy Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that it may take a new tax to launch an effective
regional land-use system--be it a regional sales tax, a new motor
vehicle fee or even an income tax--something not a lot of lawmakers
are ready to line up behind.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, he said, "you are taking revenue away from local
governments. I don't think you can get past the tension that will
cause."</TE>

regionalism question whether cities will find the approach too
unpalatable.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm skeptical of having the state swooping up a locally levied
tax and redistributing it," said Fred Silva, senior advisor at the
Public Policy Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that it may take a new tax to launch an effective
regional land-use system--be it a regional sales tax, a new motor
vehicle fee or even an income tax--something not a lot of lawmakers
are ready to line up behind.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, he said, "You are taking revenue away from local
governments. I don't think you can get past the tension that will
cause."</TE>

<HD>Politician or Not, Tax Return Is Private, Not for the
Needlessly Nosy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Rose King started all this business about governors releasing their
tax returns. That was 31 years ago when she revealed that Gov. Ronald
Reagan had not paid a state income tax. Now she has two more
revelations.</LD>
<LD>   * She's ready to fess up how, as a college journalism student, she
got one of the biggest Capitol scoops ever: that the millionaire
governor who contended "taxes should hurt," so people wouldn't get
too comfortable paying them, had himself avoided paying any state
income tax for 1970.</LD>
<LD>   * Nevertheless, she doesn't think that a politician--whether a
candidate or officeholder--should have to release a personal tax
return. It's an unwarranted invasion of privacy, she says.</LD>
<TE>   I agree.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody's tax return--even a governor's or president's--should be
solely the business of the taxpayer and tax collector. Or a lender or
a court. It should not be trivia for the needlessly nosy.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the public can learn what it needs to about
politicians' investments and potential conflicts from statements of
economic interest they are required to file in Sacramento or
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, governors and presidents have been</TE>
<TE>   cowed by rivals and reporters into releasing their tax returns.
Those who refuse may pay a political penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The latest victim is Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill
Simon, who has wasted two weeks of campaigning trying to explain why
he won't share his returns with the planet.</TE>
<TE>   Says Stu Spencer, Reagan's political strategist: "There are two
basic things in modern politics. You've got to debate. And you've got
to disclose your income taxes. Those are the basics whether you like
them or not."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks in no small part to Rose King.</TE>
<TE>   In 1971, she was a single mom journalism student at Cal State
Sacramento with a campus FM radio show. She reported on the air that
Reagan had paid no state tax. Her listenership was small, however,
and the news did not spread far.</TE>
<TE>   But she also interned for Senate Democratic Caucus Chairman Mervyn
Dymally of Los Angeles. King informed her boss about the radio
report, a Capitol TV reporter was tipped and Reagan was queried at
his weekly news conference.</TE>
<TE>   The startled governor-- unReaganlike--hemmed and hawed: "You know
something, I don't actually know whether I did [pay taxes] or not."</TE>
<TE>   But minutes after the testy news conference ended, Reagan's office
confirmed that "because of business reverses" he had owed no state
tax. He did pay a federal tax. The "business reverses" turned out to
be a loophole cattle herd.</TE>
<TE>   The story dogged Reagan for months. It probably was the most
aggravating, embarrassing and damaging of his governorship.</TE>
<TE>   How did King get it? Speculation was that it leaked from the
Franchise Tax Board, but the attorney general never could find
evidence and King wouldn't talk.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never told anybody," she says, "but the statute of
limitations has run."</TE>
<TE>   A tax board employee did open Reagan's mailed return, King says,
and couldn't keep the secret. Who could? The woman told a salesclerk
she'd gotten to know at a clothing store one block from the Capitol.
The salesclerk was King's mother. Mom told daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Daughter called the state worker to hear her story firsthand, but
never personally saw Reagan's return. "I took a chance," she says,
"but told myself 'I just can't sit on this.'</TE>
<TE>   " ... I had my 15 minutes of fame."</TE>
<TE>   The Sac State student was accepted into journalism grad school at
UC Berkeley. King's sure it was because she'd nailed Reagan, the
devil incarnate at Berkeley. But she never did go into professional
journalism. King became a professional Democrat as a legislative
staffer and campaign consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan reluctantly began releasing his tax returns in 1980 while
running for president. He did every year as president, as have other
presidents. And governors. (Richard Nixon probably was the first
president to release his taxes, in 1973 while drowning in Watergate.)</TE>
<TE>   It's nonsense, King has concluded, although she does enjoy
watching Simon squirm.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a tax return is that revealing," she says. "It
really doesn't have a lot to do with the ability to govern or
policies. They already have to report their investments and that's
appropriate. But what they contribute to charity? That's really none
of my business."</TE>
<TE>   Right.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis is wrong when he asserts that Simon should release
his taxes so voters will "know whether he paid his fair share."
That's the role of the IRS and Franchise Tax Board. And what's with
"fair"? The only legitimate question is whether what is paid is what
is owed.</TE>
<TE>   After King's scoop, however, Reagan instructed his lawyer--future
U.S. Atty. Gen. William French Smith--to make sure from then on that
he always pay some income tax. Whether owed or not.</TE>

<LD>A 42-year-old man suspected of spousal abuse led police on a
high-speed chase Sunday night that ended when he rammed his van into
a truck on the northbound Golden State Freeway in Castaic.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the suspect died at the scene. They said they believe
the man intentionally crashed his Chevrolet Astro about 10:20 p.m.
after vowing to commit suicide rather than go to jail. He was alone
in the van. The crash tied up traffic along the interstate for miles.</LD>

<HD>Vote for Secession Won't Split Up L.A. Unified</HD>
<DH>Regulations: Many voters are unaware that creating a new
Valley city wouldn't automatically break up the giant school
district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If voters are asked on the November ballot to decide on San Fernando
Valley secession, Vered Samocha says she will vote yes so the region
can break away from the Los Angeles Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is, the Valley cityhood proposal has nothing to do
with schools.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought we'd get our own district," Samocha said while picking
up her three children at Woodlake Avenue Elementary School in
Woodland Hills. "That was my only consideration for voting."</LD>
<TE>   Samocha is not alone. Parents around the Valley confuse the two
entirely separate issues of Valley secession and the creation of a
new school district, mistakenly thinking that one will lead to the
other.</TE>
<TE>   But in the last year, as Valley secession gained momentum, a
movement to break up the school district died when the California
Board of Education in December rejected a proposal to put the issue
on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The school district has nothing to do with Valley secession, said
L.A. Unified Supt. Roy Romer, noting the state board voted 10 to 0
against putting the school district breakup proposal on the ballot.
"It was a very strong vote and that was the right decision," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But, if cityhood is realized, secessionists say schools as well as
a separate transit system are the next steps. The clout of a new
Valley city, which would be the sixth-largest in the country, may
give area residents their best chance for a separate school district,
proponents say.</TE>
<TE>   When the school breakup movement began in 1999, city secessionists
watched closely, hoping that success with the school district would
give their cityhood campaign momentum.</TE>
<TE>   School district secessionists have long complained that L.A.
Unified, the nation's second-largest school district with more than
700,000 students, is too big. Some Valley parents oppose their local
schools being filled with students from outside their neighborhoods;
others say there are too few board members to represent the
222-square-mile Valley area of the district.</TE>
<TE>   But for many, the distinction between the fates of the city and
school district is blurred.</TE>
<TE>   "I assumed the school district would go too," said Ken Clay,
outside Germain Elementary School in Chatsworth. "If they're going
through the trouble to split the city, they should give control of
the schools over too."</TE>
<TE>   June Halper of Woodland Hills agreed. "The only reason I'd vote
for [secession] is if we can pull away from LAUSD," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of Valley VOTE, the group pushing to split
the Valley from Los Angeles, said people are confused because the
issues are similar.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen a tremendous amount of concern about a need to
reorganize city government as well as the schools," Close said. If
the Valley becomes a separate city, "it's a fair assumption that
having a separate school district and transit [system are] not far
behind," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Close said Valley VOTE has no intention of misleading voters by
associating city secession with school breakup.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeff Daar of the anti-secession group One Los Angeles said he
thinks it would work to Valley VOTE's advantage to have parents think
a vote for city secession was a vote for school district breakup.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect them to do anything they can to mislead people," Daar
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stephanie Carter, who led the failed campaign for a Valley school
district, said she worked hard to keep the two issues separate
because not all who favor school district breakup are in favor of
city secession.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems logical to think that if you have your own city, you
would get your own school district," Carter said.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood separatists confronted similar confusion.</TE>
<TE>   Gene LaPietra, a Hollywood secessionist and president of Hollywood
Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, said he made it a point to
explain that L.A. Unified would still run Hollywood schools if a city
breakup occurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We dealt with that very early on," LaPietra said. "We put fliers
together. We had town hall meetings. It was always a question. Now
it's never a question."</TE>
<TE>   Forming a new city may not necessarily signal change for the
school system. In addition to Los Angeles, L.A. Unified serves 27
other cities, although all are substantially smaller than the
proposed Valley city, which would have a population of 1.35 million.</TE>
<TE>   Recent bids in Carson and Lomita to break off from L.A. Unified
failed. The issue was on the ballot in Carson in November, but it
lost resoundingly after a fierce campaign by the teachers union to
defeat it. The last city to successfully break away from L.A. Unified
was Torrance in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   State Board of Education member Suzanne Tacheny said a city's size
has little to do with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   "The law on what we may consider as a board is very specific,"
Tacheny said. "We must consider criteria like the effect on
education, ethnic distribution, economic impact and how do the
facilities divide up with the rest of the city."</TE>
<TE>   Of the district's 947 schools and centers, 230 are in the Valley,
serving 200,000 students. The Valley is home to 47 of the district's
155 magnet programs as well as some of its highest-achieving
campuses: El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills with its
celebrated academic decathlon program, Granada Hills High School,
Nobel Middle School in Northridge and Carpenter Avenue Elementary
School in Studio City, all of which have solid academic test scores.</TE>
<TE>   Another school secession campaign would face the same obstacles as
the previous movement. It would again require thousands of signatures
to be presented to the Los Angeles County Office of Education, which
would study the proposal before making a recommendation to the State
Board of Education. The state board rarely contradicts a county's
recommendation, board member Tacheny said, and it did not with last
year's petition for a Valley breakaway vote.</TE>
<TE>   Carter said she knows of no new campaign for a Valley school
district. Still, few believe the issue will remain dormant.</TE>

<HD>Bonuses Paid for Canceled Events</HD>
<DH>Tourism: L.A. convention bureau staff got $225,000 for
goals that went unmet when 20 bookings were lost. City finances
suffered and hotel operators were angered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles convention bureau paid $225,000 in bonuses to its
sales staff and executives for booking events at the city-owned
convention center although 20 of the events cited to justify the
payments were later canceled, angering local hotel owners and raising
questions about the bureau's accounting and management practices.</LD>
<LD>   Overall, 42 conventions once listed as "definite" have been
canceled in the last three years--but only after bureau staff were
allowed to count all but five of those conventions toward their
annual goals and bonuses.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers for at least 12 of those 42 conventions said in
interviews that they thought they had never made a definite
commitment to come to Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The cancellation rate, which bureau officials acknowledge is
higher than ever before, has strained the city treasury, triggered a
city review of bureau operations and led some downtown hotel owners
to complain that the booking practices have forced them to fill empty
rooms caused by false expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems clear to me there were a lot of bookings that simply
were not true bookings," said Uno Thimansson, operator of the Hotel
Figueroa. "It's devastating to the hotels, because if you block space
for future years thinking it's definite, you end up turning down
business."</TE>
<TE>   Bureau President George Kirk- land, who shared in the bonuses,
said that a lack of hotels near the convention center and the
sluggish economy are the main culprits for what he admitted was a
rash of cancellations higher than the bureau has ever experienced
before. He said the bureau's booking practices were not to blame but
has nonetheless taken steps to tighten the process.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland said the bureau considers a booking "definite" once an
organization sends a letter indicating that it plans to hold a
convention in Los Angeles, although such letters of intent are not
legally binding. Anaheim and San Francisco also follow this practice.</TE>
<TE>   Other cities, including Long Beach and Phoenix, require signed
contracts and deposits before a booking is designated as definite.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reviewed four years of bookings and bonuses for the Los
Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, which is responsible, under a
city contract, for soliciting major conventions that are booked more
than two years in advance. The contract, which last year resulted in
the city paying $17.5 million to the bureau, also calls on the
nonprofit organization to boost the number of tourists and visitors
to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The peak time for bonuses was a two-year period ending June 30,
2000, when the bureau paid $225,000 to its convention salespeople, a
manager overseeing them and Kirkland, for achieving either individual
or bureauwide convention sales goals.</TE>
<TE>   The bonuses for convention sales averaged $34,600 per person for
the two-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland, who receives a $285,000 annual salary, got a total bonus
of $155,000 in the fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, and a $199,000
bonus in the fiscal year ending June 2000. Kirkland said $55,720 of
his total bonus in the year ending June 2000 came from convention
sales, with the rest for his successes in tourism and management.</TE>
<TE>   No bonuses were paid last year because the bureau fell far short
of its goal of booking 51 conventions. Kirkland said it is unlikely
that bonuses will be paid for the current fiscal year ending in June
because the bureau has booked only six conventions toward a goal of
35.</TE>
<TE>   In the fiscal year that ended in June 2000, when the biggest
bonuses were paid, the bureau set a goal for its salespeople of 62
major convention bookings with 810,000 room nights. After subtracting
cancellations in the same fiscal year, it reported net bookings of 63
events with 845,711 room nights. Because it met the goal, bureau
staff and management executives were entitled to bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   However, since the fiscal year ended and after the bonuses were
paid, 11 of the "definite" events representing 144,900 room nights
were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Some convention organizers said in interviews that despite being
listed as definite, they never committed to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not announce a convention until it is definite, and we
never announced going to Los Angeles," said Nancy Elder, meetings
director for the American Society for Microbiology, which the bureau
listed as a definite booking in late 1999. The convention, to be held
in 2004, is set for New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   She said her group never signed a contract. The group only sent a
letter to the bureau saying that "it is the intention" to go to Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the event and its 30,875 room nights were counted by the
bureau toward its goals for that year.</TE>
<TE>   In the fiscal year ending June 1999, the bureau said it met its
sales goal of booking 55 events with 750,000 hotel room nights. The
bureau reported that it booked 59 conventions with 755,684 room
nights.</TE>
<TE>   However, nine of the events have since been canceled, representing
86,325 hotel room nights.</TE>
<TE>   In interviews with The Times, organizers of a dozen conventions
listed as definite in the last few years said that, from their
perspective, they had never committed to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Los Angeles booking was never definite," said Michelle
Kirkwood of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which was
listed by the bureau as definite for 2001, 2004 and 2007, all of
which were later canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The group had sent a letter to the bureau saying that it "has
decided on a firm rotation" that included Los Angeles, but Kirkwood
said subsequent talks never reached fruition.</TE>
<TE>   The group met last year in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Other groups have faced delays in being taken off the bureau
booking lists.</TE>
<TE>   In a July 2001 letter to the bureau, Kati Quigley of the Assn. for
Financial Professionals said her group was frustrated by attempts to
have the bureau acknowledge that the group would not meet in Los
Angeles in 2006.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley said that she told Dan Herbers, a former bureau senior
vice president, after a problem-plagued 1999 conference that the
group would not return to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The executive, Quigley wrote, "at the time asked me to delay
writing the [cancellation] letter as a favor. I did so...."</TE>
<TE>   "The [cancellation] request was made a few more times, but again
we were asked to delay the formal cancellation," she wrote, adding
that she finally had lunch with another top bureau official and made
it clear "that we had no intentions of meeting in L.A. in the near
future."</TE>
<TE>   Only after she sent the letter was the event taken off the bureau
books, two years after bureau officials were first notified.</TE>
<TE>   Herbers said he was only doing what any good salesman does, trying
to keep the booking alive so he could change their minds and get them
to come to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't just shut the door on them," he said, noting that there
have been occasions when groups that canceled changed their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Even when conventions are held in Los Angeles, hotel owners
complain that the bureau frequently overestimates the number of hotel
room nights that would be booked.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, for purposes of getting a bonus and meeting the city
goals, the bureau said it booked an event by PeopleSoft for the year
2000 that would result in 57,920 hotel room nights. But after the
event was held, the bureau reported that only 30,726 room nights were
actually booked.</TE>
<TE>   For the year 2000, the bureau estimated that there would be
502,968 hotel room nights, but only 390,564 were booked, according to
PKF, a bureau consultant. The 112,404 lost bookings cost the hotels
$19.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   In reaction to the complaints of hotel owners, an internal audit
was done by the bureau's regular accountant, Arthur Andersen LLP. It
found no fraudulent inflation of bookings but identified some flaws
in the booking practices that Kirk- land said he is addressing.</TE>
<TE>   The audit said that of 35 conventions that canceled between June
1, 1999, and Feb. 28, 2001, only 11 were "confirmed definite" in
writing, based on the content of letters.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty others were listed by the bureau as definite although they
only submitted "letters of intent," three were contingent on actions
including the construction of a new downtown hotel, and one event was
listed accidentally, the audit found.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears to me the bookings were inflated," said Brian
Fitzgerald, general manager of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel. "We
certainly had a lot of bonuses paid out."</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland said there are safeguards against inflating bookings to
boost bonuses. If a booking cancels in a future year, the booking and
hotel room nights are counted against the goal for that subsequent
year, so in theory salespeople have to book that many more events to
earn a bonus, he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, some salespeople responsible for canceled bookings have
left the bureau in the last few years. Also, the bureau has actually
reduced its convention sales goals, from 62 two years ago to 35 this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland has made some changes: Convention organizers are now
asked to sign a letter to confirm their booking.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Zen, owner of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and president of
the city Convention Center Commission, said Kirkland's changes do not
go far enough. He contends that the bureau's "phantom" bookings have
misled the city, which pays the nonprofit organization up to $17.5
million a year to book conventions and promote tourism.</TE>
<TE>   The large number of cancellations since 1999 has depressed
convention center profits and hotel bed tax money, which are used to
pay the $42-million annual debt on the 1993 expansion of the
convention center. As a result, the city next year will have to
increase general fund payments toward the debt by $6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some downtown business owners want the bureau to adopt the tougher
Long Beach policy requiring a contract to be signed before an event
is considered definite.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to differentiate between the conventions that are
shopping around and those that are actually coming," said Linda
Griego, a downtown restaurant owner who until recently was a member
of the bureau board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, 'definite' means they are definitely coming, not they are
definitely not sure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Thimansson, owner of the Figueroa Hotel, would go further. Bonuses
should not be awarded until the convention is held and the estimated
hotel bookings are verified, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau Vice President Michael Collins said convention organizers
might be scared off if they were asked to sign a contract too soon.</TE>
<TE>   "If we say you have to sign a contract, they will say, 'Bye,'"
Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   Responded Griego: "There was always a reluctance to push for a
definite answer for fear someone would back out, but if it's that
fragile, it's not definite."</TE>

<HD>Festivals Play Up Varied Aspects of Diverse City</HD>
<DH>Culture: Thousands flock to a Latino- oriented fiesta and a
celebration of books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly a quarter-million Los Angeles-area residents chose taquitos
and ranchera music on Broadway downtown. Miles west, another large
crowd, an estimated 150,000 over two days, feted the written word at
the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books on the lawns of UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   The juxtaposition was enough to make writer Luis Rodriguez, an
East L.A. native, a little uncomfortable as he prepared to speak at a
panel at the book festival.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not saying we shouldn't be here," he said to fellow panelists
Yxta Maya Murray, Gregory Rodriguez and Victor Villasenor. "But we
should be over there too. There's no literary element to Fiesta
Broadway at all."</LD>
<TE>   On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, the
city that helped define ethnic and social division offered a glimpse
of two fiestas.</TE>
<TE>   With the sun hot off the asphalt and the overlapping sound of
competing vendors, Luis Remache huffed on an Andean reed pipe in
front of an appliance store below the old Cameo Theater marquee on
Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   A Dodgers game on a $99 television provided a backdrop for him, as
he faced the line of vendors giving away everything from AARP sun
visors to diapers, Listerine, Pepcid and Maggi bullion cubes.</TE>
<TE>   On a once-grand boulevard brought back from the dead by
bargain-basement, mom-and-pop businesses catering to Latino shoppers,
Sunday's Fiesta Broadway was a carnival of commercialism.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, it seems, now realizes there is a Spanish-speaking
market, Remache figured.</TE>
<TE>   "Ten years ago, it wasn't something you talked about," the
Ecuadoran immigrant said. "Now, you do."</TE>
<TE>   Banks, remittance services, cell phone vendors, weight-loss
schemes, make-up miracles and your-name-on-rice souvenirs (in
Spanish) were all vying for attention and money. Even Remache paused
to hawk his own CDs to a crowd that by midafternoon was ankle-deep in
pamphlets and arm-weary with giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   Broadway was redolent with the smells of carne asada and taquitos,
while the bouncy rhythms of ranchera music battled with urban rap and
old-school mariachis.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the crowds that endured the long lines at merchants'
booths complained that some of the emotion and flair of the festival,
now in its 13th year, had vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Though violence marred its early years, the fiesta has long since
settled into family carnival fare, including a dollar-a-peek display
of a "two-headed baby."</TE>
<TE>   Police reported no serious problems Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Before there was too much emotion; now there's too much
promotion," said Mario Lopez, 32, a Canoga Park resident lending
unintended poetry to his review.</TE>
<TE>   Across town at UCLA, a more classical-music-and-Chardonnay crowd
surrounded Caroline Navarro, an eighth-grader from South-Central who
chose the book fair over Fiesta Broadway. The 14-year-old said she
felt as if she stood out until she saw and heard Villasenor, her
favorite Chicano author.</TE>
<TE>   "He acted very Mexican," she said of Villasenor, who spiced his
panel discussion with Spanish colloquialisms and swear words. "He's
very proud of it," Navarro said. "When I was in there, I felt right
at home."</TE>
<TE>   Historian and state Librarian Kevin Starr said the two festivals
speak more of the unity of Los Angeles than of its lingering
differences.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not two different worlds at all," Starr said before
speaking at a separate book festival panel on inventing Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's contrasting at all. Like everything in L.A.,
come back in 15 years and you'll see how many Latino writers are
here, especially as this generation gets its voice. The two worlds
are helping each other come into being."</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Murray said she found the city's thirst for Latino
culture strong.</TE>
<TE>   But when she writes, she said, "I feel like an archeologist. Any
Latino or Latina writer is dealing with the past that has been in
large part stolen or destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   Outside at the vending booths--the element both festivals held
most in common--Lilly Sunn searched for Spanish-language authors. She
found them at Martinez Books and Art.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more comfortable here," Sunn, a native of Peru, said of
the book fair.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's because I'm melting into the American culture. I
feel comfortable if I'm surrounded like this. If I go to a Mexican
festival, I don't feel at home."</TE>

<HD>Redondo Beach Debates 'Heart of the City'</HD>
<DH>Land use: A massive redevelopment plan for underused
beachfront, old power plant would again create a town center for
community.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Redondo Beach, a debate has raged for almost three years between
those who see change as inevitable and positive and those who see it
as a threat to their relatively peaceful lifestyle.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a massive redevelopment plan for an underutilized
beachfront and an aging power plant.</LD>
<LD>   The plan is called the Heart of the City because, proponents say,
it would once again create a town center in the community,
revitalizing the harbor area with new housing and commercial
development.</LD>
<TE>   But some residents say that by fighting the plan, they are
defending the very soul of their city.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't do anything, this is going to turn us into just
another one of those cities where you don't know your next-door
neighbor from anyone else," said Redondo Beach resident Erika
Robinson. "This is our last stand, our last opportunity to say enough
is enough."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials say that once the area is redeveloped, Redondo
Beach will still be Redondo Beach, albeit a bit more polished.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this feeling of wanting to keep this place for ourselves
because here, in a way, we have a little enclave away from the hustle
and bustle of our everyday lives," said Mayor Greg Hill. "None of
that will change with Heart of the City."</TE>
<TE>   Stretching from Herondo Street on the north to Torrance Boulevard
on the south, the plan would turn most of Catalina Avenue into a
residential neighborhood and transform the harbor into a seaside
village.</TE>
<TE>   Acres of parking lots would become a pedestrian-friendly shopping
district, and a large portion of the power plant would be gutted and
replaced with new offices and homes.</TE>
<TE>   The plan would cost an estimated $1 billion in private sector
investments and $49 million for infrastructure repairs and
improvements. Virginia-based AES Corp., which owns the power plant,
would pay about $90 million for cleanup, demolition and electrical
costs. After the work was done, the plant would be about a third of
its current 52-acre size.</TE>
<TE>   The plan allows for 2,998 new housing units and 657,000 square
feet of commercial space, though AES envisions only 1,100 residential
units, said General Manager C.J. Thompson. Commercial space would
occupy 100,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Staunch supporters applaud efforts to rebuild the downtown area
that an earlier city administration tore down in the 1960s. But
Robinson is not alone in her dismay.</TE>
<TE>   School board members say the extra housing would bring
more children into already crowded schools. Bicyclists and boaters
complain that the plan ignores their needs.</TE>
<TE>   And some very vocal residents of Redondo Beach and neighboring
Hermosa Beach worry about traffic. If built to its maximum capacity,
the project would produce an estimated 3,500 extra vehicle trips
during the evening rush hour--too many for the area to handle, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   But after years of revisions, public hearings, workshops and a
lengthy two-night meeting that ended after midnight last month, the
City Council unanimously passed the Heart of the City specific plan
and certified the environmental impact report.</TE>
<TE>   The plan will go to the California Coastal Commission for final
approval unless Robinson and other volunteers belonging to a newly
formed group, Citizens for a Vote on Heart of the City, can get the
4,000 signatures needed to force the issue onto the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The group circulated two petitions against the project--one
challenging the zoning, the other the specific plan--and on April 18
submitted more than 6,000 signatures for each initiative. City Hall
has 30 days to count and certify the signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Hill and his City Council colleagues insist that the plan is
merely a broad guide for development, not a definitive blueprint.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not what we're bound to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said that neither he nor other city officials have any
intention of building to capacity, but that in order to attract more
developers and be eligible for federal funds, the plan has to be
flexible and allow for some areas of higher density and affordable
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said he hopes residents can trust that their elected
officials are doing what's right for the city. But in Redondo
Beach--a community still haunted by past development mistakes--that
might be easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in the 1960s, the city's historic but dilapidated
downtown was torn down in favor of condos, offices and off-street
parking. So many condominiums were built south of the pier in the
1970s that some locals dubbed the city Recondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But despite millions spent in redevelopment dollars, Redondo Beach
has never achieved the success of similar beachfront commercial
districts in nearby Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way, we're almost paying for the sins of the father--they
tore it out," Hill said of the old downtown. "We're trying in any way
we can to recapture that." Even so, critics have "aligned us with the
same process we're trying to fix," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Heart of the City proponents want to make the area more inviting,
but not as a tourist destination like the Third Street Promenade in
Santa Monica. They hope to create an area where locals will want to
dine, shop or simply enjoy the water.</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity for change came in 1998, when AES announced that
it would downsize the plant and use the remaining land to build
townhomes and offices.</TE>
<TE>   City leaders would have preferred to see the facility shut down,
but state officials decided that the plant could not be closed
because it was needed during emergencies or when other electrical
sources failed, a point driven home last year during the state's
power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, AES' plans to redevelop provided the city an
opportunity to design a master plan that would revitalize North
Catalina Avenue and the harbor area. What followed was years of
debate on exactly what the new vision should entail.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Lesser, 61, president of Body Glove in Redondo Beach, said he
is all for Heart of the City, even though his business might have to
relocate under the new zoning for the area.</TE>
<TE>   But some people will take some convincing.</TE>
<TE>   Neighboring Hermosa Beach filed a lawsuit April 19 against Redondo
Beach, saying that mitigation measures in the plan's environmental
impact report don't do enough to alleviate potential increases in
traffic and congestion along Hermosa's southern border.</TE>
<TE>   Hill has said he will support anything his constituents decide to
do, but warns that zoning and planning are not issues that should be
decided through referendums.</TE>
<TE>   If residents vote against the Heart of the City plan, he said,
they might end up reverting to the current zoning, which allows for
even more development and so-called big-box retailers.</TE>
<TE>   "I urge people to take the time to educate themselves about this
before they sign anything," Hill said. "You can't just vote yes or no
on something this complex."</TE>

<HD>Maverick Teacher Gives Aspiring Jockeys a Leg Up</HD>
<DH>Somis: Frank Garza, who learned his craft the hard way,
runs one of the few schools for thoroughbred riders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chunky at 55, Frank Garza makes clicking noises with his mouth as a
determined young woman atop a thoroughbred named Uncle Bob lopes
circles around him.</LD>
<LD>   "Squeeze those knees!" Garza commands from the center of the sand
ring.</LD>
<LD>   Sweat cascades down the face of Xochi Flores, the sister of a
jockey who has won million-dollar purses and raced in places as
far-flung as Dubai. At 28, she wants to get into the game herself and
has picked retired jockey Garza to help her.</LD>
<TE>   "Turn that left foot in! Keep your hands down!" he barks. "Both
hands! This is a racehorse, not a pony--you can't control him with
one hand!"</TE>
<TE>   Set on a tranquil farm in the orange groves of Somis, Garza's
operation is part outdoor classroom and part equine boot camp. It's
light years from the turf of longshots and sure things, but it's one
of the few places in the U.S. where aspiring jockeys can go for
instruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm gonna wear you out today, OK?" Garza tells his student. "I
told you it wouldn't be easy just because you're David Flores'
sister."</TE>
<TE>   "It's not," she pants.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Tijuana, Xochi (pronounced "ZO-shee") Flores just
moved to tiny Somis from Pasadena. She found a room and took a job at
a local grocery so she could undergo Garza's grueling regimen a
couple of hours each day.</TE>
<TE>   Such commitment isn't unusual among Garza's students.</TE>
<TE>   Now an apprentice jockey at Bay Meadows in San Mateo, Francisco
Duran worked days as a busboy at a Camarillo country club and nights
as a janitor. At 5 a.m., he'd show up at Garza's place to shovel
manure out of stalls and go through his mentor's ceaseless drills.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Oxnard, Duran never rode a horse. Even after he
declared that his life's purpose was jockeying, he'd jump when a
horse nearby whinnied. But he was strong for his 5-foot-2 frame and
he burned with ambition.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wanted it so bad," he says. "That's why I stuck with it."</TE>
<TE>   Years ago, Garza wanted it just as passionately.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up poor, the son of a Texas ranch manager who bounced from
town to town. He remembers his dad tying him to a saddle when he was
a toddler. At 10, he won his first race, taking home $150. Soon he
was hopping buses to tracks all over Texas, a lonely, 78-pound high
school dropout seeking his fortune from Bandera to Beeville.</TE>
<TE>   He worked nights at a cotton gin, slept in cold tack rooms, did
odd jobs around stables. Eventually, he joined the pros at tracks
like Santa Anita and Hollywood Park. He made a nice living and once
beat his idol, the legendary Willie Shoemaker. He also broke more
bones than he can remember. When a stallion reared back and stomped
the daylights out of his back and shoulder in 1980, he retired.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't regret leaving," he says. "I mean, if you've been at it
since you were 5, you get kind of tired."</TE>
<TE>   Garza lives a quiet suburban life in Newbury Park. He and his wife
just celebrated their 30th wedding anniversary. He dotes on his three
children and his grandson. He says his greatest thrills have come not
on the track but from watching his sons score points for Newbury Park
High School's basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't seem like a maverick, but for eight years, Garza has
broken with racing tradition and offered to train anyone who dreams
of piloting a thundering, 1,200-pound thoroughbred into the
homestretch. While jockey schools have taken root in Japan and the
United Kingdom, most jockeys in the U.S. pick up their skills
informally, working as hired hands at horse farms and then as
exercise riders at racetracks.</TE>
<TE>   The system frustrates would-be jockeys who don't have family
connections.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost everyone I know has a dad who was a trainer or used to be
a jockey," says Kevin Mangold, a former student of Garza's who has
been riding at Santa Anita since August. "A couple of years ago I
went down to the track and said, 'I want to be a jockey. Can any of
you guys put me on as an exercise rider?' They all kind of laughed at
me."</TE>
<TE>   A 5-foot-tall actor who had tired of playing children and elves,
Mangold commuted six days a week from Hollywood to Garza's school,
leaving his apartment before dawn. For eight months, he rode in the
mornings, worked as a computer consultant afternoons and evenings,
and squeezed in auditions when he could.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been tough, but it's a dream," says Mangold. "It's as if I
were a tall guy who had been working a conveyor belt somewhere and
now I'm in the NBA. I wouldn't be riding races at Santa Anita if it
weren't for Frank."</TE>
<TE>   Garza teaches jockeying from the ground up, generally working with
just one student at a time. He shows his charges how to muck out
stalls, how to groom horses, how to be comfortable around skittish
thoroughbreds. After months of drills, he teaches them things that
separate a jockey from a mere rider: how to explode out of a starting
gate, how to take turns on a half-mile track, how to slow a horse
without breaking its rhythm, how to make your move through a knot of
jockeys thirsty to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Trust me," Garza says. "They don't make room for you."</TE>
<TE>   It's not for everyone. Garza's full-time students ante up about
$1,000 monthly for six or seven months. After 30 days, he boots
students who are less than committed.</TE>
<TE>   "I tell them up front they've got to show me what they've got," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Students range from teenage girls who are crazy about horses to an
architectural draftsman who had a revelation about his true calling.
About 15 of the 70 he's tutored over the years now work at
racetracks, he says. Most are exercise riders, who can earn up to
$40,000 a year, and a few are jockeys, whose earning potential can
be--but usually isn't--in the millions.</TE>
<TE>   One of Garza's most accomplished students, J.C. Gonzalez, was
killed in a fall during a 1999 race at Los Angeles' Fairplex Park.</TE>
<TE>   "I was devastated," Garza says. "He was like a member of the
family. I kept asking myself: What could I have done?"</TE>
<TE>   As an exhausted Xochi Flores blazes around the ring again,
standing in her stirrups, Garza gives her a thumbs-up and she
responds with a smile as broad as the backstretch at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   "OK!" Garza shouts. "That's what I want to see! Get out of the
way, David Flores--we're coming on!"</TE>

<HD>An Anniversary of Anger, Sadness and Pride</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Community groups and churches spent the weekend commemorating today's
10th anniversary of the Los Angeles riots, with pointed differences
in historical interpretation. Where some mourned three days of random
anarchy and some praised economic development, others celebrated
rebellion or remembered reasons they thought justified the deadly
rage.</LD>
<LD>   On Saturday, a group of Koreans, Latinos and whites assembled for
a candlelight vigil and march at the First AME Church and called for
interracial unity, love and healing.</LD>
<LD>   First AME was where Los Angeles' black establishment gathered
during the riots in an attempt to quell the violence. It also will be
the one stop President Bush makes in deference to the riot
anniversary today when he visits Los Angeles on a political
fund-raising trip.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, First AME leaders began their three-day commemoration
of the riots by leading the media on a tour of sites that had been
rebuilt or renovated in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Mark Whitlock, executive director of the church's
economic-development wing, FAME Renaissance, narrated as the church
bus wove through a network of neighborhood economic projects,
business initiatives and employment training services that he said
has generated nearly 6,700 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   South-Central still contains a disproportionate number of desolate
parcels whose businesses were burned down during the riots. But
Whitlock cited a variety of properties the church has reclaimed in
the last 10 years from drug dealers, gangs and prostitutes. It also
has built affordable housing units for families as well as for people
with AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   The church handed reporters its 2002 printed analysis of the
riots, which broke out after a predominantly white jury acquitted
four white police officers accused of beating black motorist Rodney
G. King: "Feeling the pinch of a depressed economy and the insulting
slap of discrimination, the trial's outcome pushed residents past
their boiling point," it read in part. "Torching neighborhoods,
looting businesses and assaulting passersby, the community found
solace in a senseless bout of self-destruction."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday morning at First AME, politicians and celebrities who
had joined in the original cleanup effort were greeted by television
cameras and reporters. The first hour of the service was a
celebration, religious as usual, but also civic. Continuing with the
church's theme of rebirth and renaissance, the congregation and
leadership thanked those who had taken the first steps to clean and
heal the city.</TE>
<TE>   Actors Edward James Olmos and Lindsay Wagner received standing
ovations and gifts from the church, an African mask for Olmos and a
silken scarf for Wagner. Also present were two dozen civic leaders or
their representatives, including former mayoral candidate Antonio
Villaraigosa, county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo, City Council President Alex Padilla and Councilman
Nate Holden.</TE>
<TE>   "April 29th, the not-guilty verdicts sparked pain and anger, and
the fires that devastated L.A. also devastated hopes and dreams,"
said the Rev. Cecil Murray, the church's pastor. "But out of the
ashes came a renaissance, a revival."</TE>
<TE>   A different riot was remembered Saturday on a parched grass field
behind the gym of a Watts housing project. Activists, church leaders,
poets, rappers and residents paid tribute to the people who took to
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   To this gathering at Nickerson Gardens, what happened that April
29 was not a riot, but political action born of outrage. Some wore
black T-shirts warning "Police nearby." Others wore shirts with the
face of Gonzalo Martinez, shot and killed by police last February
after a car chase in Downey. In Spanish, shirts said: Se Justifica La
Rebellion!</TE>
<TE>   About 50 African Americans, Latinos and a few white people
gathered. A police car pulled into the field to watch the
demonstration, then another and another. It was a politically radical
crowd that included the Revolutionary Communist Party and a coalition
against police brutality.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, six squad cars parked a few hundred feet from the
demonstrators and the crowd began to chant "Oink! Oink!" and "No
justice, no peace, no murdering police."</TE>
<TE>   "Are all police bad? No," said the Rev. Richard Byrd of KRST Unity
Center, who also calls himself Meri Ka Ra. "Are there some bad ones?
Yes. And we are here to speak out against their brutality."</TE>
<TE>   Nickerson Gardens was chosen as the site for the event because the
economic boom of the late '90s brought no economic boom to Watts,
Byrd said. The same poverty that existed in 1965 and in 1992 still
exists today. "Where is the infrastructure? Where is the beauty?
Where are the trees?" Byrd asked.</TE>
<TE>   On a nearby cinder-block wall, the coalition has erected a
makeshift gallery of images from April 29, 1992, and events leading
up to the city's explosion: There is a portrait of a thoughtful
Rodney King, hand to his chin; the Rev. Murray weeps at the verdicts
acquitting the four officers; an angry man with dreadlocks yells at a
line of impassive police officers; and a young woman gingerly walks
through debris in a store, carrying out bags of groceries.</TE>
<TE>   "This rebellion was the most beautiful, the most heroic" civil
action in the history of the United States, said Joe Veale, a
spokesman for the Revolutionary Communist Party.</TE>
<TE>   Rappers and poets likened blacks and Latinos to Palestinians,
calling them besieged and oppressed peoples living in police states.</TE>
<TE>   Mistakes were made in 1992, many said, alluding to hundreds of
millions of dollars in damage to Korean-owned stores, much of it from
bitterness over the killing of a black teenage girl by a Korean
grocer during an altercation. Koreans are not the enemy, they said,
and neither are white people. "The system" is.</TE>
<TE>   At Chesterfield Square on Sunday afternoon, "the system" was given
a pat on the back: The square, a large retail development in
South-Central that opened last year, was formally dedicated, as
developers took symbolic advantage of the riot anniversary, and civic
dignitaries turned out.</TE>
<TE>   At Faith United Methodist Community Church about 50 blocks south,
no politicians or actors visited the chapel that was home to the
committee supporting the six black men charged with beating white
trucker Reginald Denny on the first day of the riots.</TE>
<TE>   A burning building was on the church program cover with the words
"Lest We Forget." The six defendants were dubbed the L.A. Four+.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not condone what happened," Dorothy Freeman, a committee
member, told the congregation, "but we felt like the crime didn't
meet the time" the defendants served in prison.</TE>
<TE>   One of the six charged in the Denny assault, Lance Jerome Parker,
36, briefly took the podium and along with his mother, thanked the
church for its support after he was arrested in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, a former semiprofessional football player whose family
owns a nightclub, was charged with two counts of discharging a
firearm with gross negligence and faced a 15-year prison term. He was
given three years' probation and said the intervening 10 years have
softened his heart and firmed his political resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're a black man you know why it happened, you were beaten,
you were ridiculed and you were told you were nothing," he said to a
chorus of "Amens."</TE>
<TE>   Post-riot progress was acknowledged in this chapel, but in
grass-roots terms. Nana Gwamfi, a civil-rights attorney, put it this
way: The Crips and Bloods gang truce in Watts, forged after the
riots, has largely held to this day, participants said. Local
organizations that did not exist are now active and people who once
thought the city ran on its own have become politically involved.</TE>
<TE>   There are new housing and new job training programs, but the
state's three-strikes law has produced higher rates of incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   Parker, who spent six months in jail before being placed on
probation, still believes the riot was necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd do it all over the same way," he said.</TE>

<HD>War on a Tree Killer Shifts</HD>
<DH>Environment: An injected poison looks promising against an
insect that drains the life from eucalyptus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years after arriving from Australia, the psyllids are still
snacking their way through eucalyptus groves from San Clemente to the
San Fernando Valley. And as the tiny pests continue to suck the life
out of thousands of the trees, the battle to save the victims has
grown increasingly desperate.</LD>
<LD>   Arborists have attacked the red gum and spotted gum lerp psyllids
with a variety of weapons, including imported psyllid-eating wasps
also from Australia. But the wasps failed to reproduce enough to
overwhelm the growing psyllid population.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the infestation enters its fifth year, homeowners,
community associations and state park officials are having trees
injected with a pesticide called Imicide in a last-ditch attempt to
save the eucalyptus.</LD>
<TE>   In Lake Forest, considered by many to be on the front line in the
battle, homeowners are reporting moderate success with the
injections. The treatment involves drilling small holes around the
trunk of the tree and inserting a capsule that works the pesticide
into the tree's root system. In a matter of weeks, the chemical works
its way into the sap and is ingested by the psyllid, killing it.</TE>
<TE>   "The chemicals are working," said Patty Martinez, who has lost 30
of her 40 eucalyptus trees to the psyllid and has paid $3,000 to have
the withered trees removed. "I know there's always some controversy
about using chemicals, but they've saved some of our trees."</TE>
<TE>   The injections are the latest tactic in the war against the
psyllid, which has ravaged trees up and down the state since turning
up in El Monte four years ago. In Los Angeles alone, officials with
the Department of Recreation and Parks estimate that more than 30,000
trees have been infested and most will have to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cutting Them Down Is Reluctant Choice</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like cutting trees, but if they prove to be a hazard, we
have to remove them," said Teresa Proscewicz, principal forester for
the Parks Department. "We are in the process of removing over 1,000
trees right now in our parks."</TE>
<TE>   At the Arboretum of Los Angeles County in Arcadia, which has the
most extensive eucalyptus grove outside Australia with about 200
species and 1,000 trees, about a third of those trees have been
attacked by the psyllid.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Dahlsten, a professor with the UC Berkeley Center for
Biological Control who leads the wasp offensive, said it is still too
early to tell how effective the wasps can be.</TE>
<TE>   The psyllid population appears to have thinned, but Dahlsten said
he is uncertain whether it's the climate, the wasps or the fewer
numbers of eucalyptus left standing.</TE>
<TE>   Tired of waiting for nature to take its course, some have turned
to pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've saved about 1,500 trees in Lake Forest alone," said
Tim Wilkes, whose San Clemente-based company, Greenscapes, has been
administering the $50 injections to trees across Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes injected a stand of 70 trees at Doheny State Beach in Dana
Point last month and will soon hit San Clemente State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the latest damage is being done by the spotted lerp
psyllid, first discovered in Southern California two years ago by the
Center for Biological Control. The spotted variety prefers the lemon
gum eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see the new guy, the spotted lerp, in town everywhere,"
Wilkes said. "The red gum lerp psyllid has done its damage. It's hard
to find a red gum eucalyptus in Orange County that hasn't been
infested."</TE>
<TE>   The psyllid begins its attack on the eucalyptus by draining the
fluid from the long, finger-like leaves, laying eggs and covering
them with a sticky white wax--the lerp. On any given leaf, there can
be 20 or 30 lerps.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Smith, chairwoman of the Lake Forest Community Assn.'s tree
committee, knows the psyllid lifestyle all too well. Smith has lost
200 of her 265 trees. Her association has removed more than 2,700
trees from common areas and 1,000 more have been identified as
lifeless. Smith's neighbor on Woodglen Circle has 100 dead trees that
are ready for the chainsaw.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Now It's Just a Meadow of Stumps'</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved in here, I felt like I was nesting in the woods,"
said Smith, who has spent $7,000 removing and replanting trees,
spraying them with horticulture oil and Orothane, and re-landscaping
her yard. "I had sliding glass doors and no curtains. Now I've had to
make adjustments inside and outside because, suddenly, there's
constant sunshine."</TE>
<TE>   The scene across the street is even worse, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a common area between two houses that was basically a
forest of 400 trees," she said. "Now it's just a meadow of stumps."</TE>
<TE>   Nine homeowner associations in Lake Forest have asked for a
$275,000 state grant to help with the next phase: replanting.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, eucalyptus trees in the city's parks, greenbelts,
streetscapes and trails have also taken a hit. But city officials say
they are fortunate compared with the rest of the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost about 700 trees and we're replanting them one-to-one,"
said city forester Steve Bourke, who estimates that Irvine has spent
about $100,000 on the psyllid battle. "It's a problem, but it's not
catastrophic. It's not like it's decimating our urban forest."</TE>
<TE>   Bourke said the city kept waiting for the wasps to take care of
business. But 18 months after they were released in the Irvine-Tustin
area by the Center for Biological Control at UC Berkeley, no relief
is in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they didn't survive, migrate or reproduce," Bourke said.
"So we're turning to the Imicide injections."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Lake Forest residents say something had better be done
soon or their town will lose the "Forest" in its name.</TE>

<HD>Operation Eucalyptus Switches to Injections Against Killer
Pest</HD>
<DH>Environment: Wasps fail to curb the psyllid, but the new
pesticide assault shows results already.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years after arriving from Australia, the psyllids are still
snacking their way through eucalyptus groves from San Clemente to the
San Fernando Valley. And as the tiny pests continue to suck the life
out of thousands of the trees, the battle to save the victims has
grown increasingly desperate.</LD>
<LD>   Arborists have attacked the red gum and spotted gum lerp psyllids
with a variety of weapons, including imported psyllid-eating wasps,
also from Australia. But the wasps failed to reproduce enough to
overwhelm the growing psyllid population.</LD>
<LD>   Now, as the infestation enters its fifth year, homeowners,
community associations and state park officials are having trees
injected with a pesticide called Imicide in a last-ditch attempt to
save the eucalyptus.</LD>
<TE>   In Lake Forest, considered by many to be on the front line in the
battle, homeowners are reporting moderate success with the
injections. The treatment involves drilling small holes around the
trunk of the tree and inserting a capsule that works the pesticide
into the tree's root system. In a matter of weeks, the chemical works
its way into the sap and is ingested by the psyllid, killing it.</TE>
<TE>   "The chemicals are working," said Patty Martinez, who has lost 30
of her 40 eucalyptus trees to the psyllid and has paid $3,000 to have
the withered trees removed. "I know there's always some controversy
about using chemicals, but they've saved some of our trees."</TE>
<TE>   The injections are the latest tactic in the war against the
psyllid, which has ravaged trees up and down the state since turning
up in El Monte four years ago. In Los Angeles alone, officials with
the Department of Recreation and Parks estimate that more than 30,000
trees have been infested and most will have to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't like cutting trees, but if they prove to be a hazard, we
have to remove them," said Teresa Proscewicz, principal forester for
the Parks Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in the process of removing over 1,000 trees right now in
our parks."</TE>
<TE>   At the Arboretum of Los Angeles County in Arcadia, which has the
most extensive eucalyptus grove outside Australia with about 200
species and 1,000 trees, about a third of those trees have been
attacked by the psyllid.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Dahlsten, a professor with the UC Berkeley Center for
Biological Control who leads the wasp offensive, said it is still too
early to tell how effective the wasps can be.</TE>
<TE>   The psyllid population appears to have thinned, but Dahlsten said
he is uncertain whether it's the climate, the wasps or the fewer
numbers of eucalyptus left standing.</TE>
<TE>   Tired of waiting for nature to take its course, some have turned
to pesticides.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've saved about 1,500 trees in Lake Forest alone," said
Tim Wilkes, whose San Clemente-based company, Greenscapes, has been
administering the $50 injections to trees across Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkes injected a stand of 70 trees at Doheny State Beach in Dana
Point last month and will soon hit San Clemente State Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the latest damage is being done by the spotted lerp
psyllid, first discovered in Southern California two years ago by the
Center for Biological Control. The spotted variety prefers the lemon
gum eucalyptus.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll see the new guy, the spotted lerp, in town everywhere,"
Wilkes said. "The red gum lerp psyllid has done its damage. It's hard
to find a red gum eucalyptus in Orange County that hasn't been
infested."</TE>
<TE>   The psyllid begins its attack on the eucalyptus by draining the
fluid from the long, finger-like leaves, laying eggs and covering
them with a sticky white wax--the lerp. On any given leaf, there can
be 20 or 30 lerps.</TE>
<TE>   Laurie Smith, chairwoman of the Lake Forest Community Assn.'s tree
committee, knows the psyllid lifestyle all too well. Smith has lost
200 of her 265 trees. Her association has removed more than 2,700
trees from common areas and 1,000 more have been identified as
lifeless. Smith's neighbor on Woodglen Circle has 100 dead trees that
are ready for the chainsaw.</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved in here, I felt like I was nesting in the woods,"
said Smith, who has spent $7,000 removing and replanting trees,
spraying them with horticulture oil and Orothane, and re-landscaping
her yard.</TE>
<TE>   "I had sliding glass doors and no curtains. Now I've had to make
adjustments inside and outside because, suddenly, there's constant
sunshine."</TE>
<TE>   The scene across the street is worse, Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a common area between two houses that was basically a
forest of 400 trees," she said. "Now it's just a meadow of stumps."</TE>
<TE>   Nine homeowner associations in Lake Forest have asked for a
$275,000 state grant to help with the next phase: replanting.</TE>
<TE>   In Irvine, eucalyptus trees in the city's parks, greenbelts,
streetscapes and trails have also taken a hit. But city officials say
they are fortunate compared with the rest of the region.</TE>
<TE>   "We've lost about 700 trees and we're replanting them one-to-one,"
said city forester Steve Bourke, who estimates that Irvine has spent
about $100,000 on the psyllid battle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a problem, but it's not catastrophic. It's not like it's
decimating our urban forest."</TE>
<TE>   Bourke said the city kept waiting for the wasps to take care of
business. But 18 months after they were released in the Irvine-Tustin
area by the Center for Biological Control at UC Berkeley, no relief
is in sight.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess they didn't survive, migrate or reproduce," Bourke said.
"So we're turning to the Imicide injections."</TE>

<HD>Rep. Lee Could Outdo Davis Just by Showing Up</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The only member of Congress to vote against military retaliation for
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks gets a hearing this evening from the
Valley Democrats United group in Los Angeles, and will probably get
some contributions too.</LD>
<LD>   Oakland Democrat Barbara Lee's minority-of-one vote has brought
her death threats, but it also has brought her about twice as much in
campaign contributions as she usually pulls in.</LD>
<LD>   And it just earned her the Wayne Morse Integrity in Government
Award, named for the late maverick Oregon senator.</LD>
<TE>   Lee is a solid booking, which is more than the same Democratic
group could say of Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   On Earth Day, the group braved the heat and the Green Partiers to
set up a booth at Lake Balboa to register voters and woo them to the
Democratic side of the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   A half-hour before Davis showed up, says a Valley Dem, his advance
man told volunteers to "spread the word" that Davis was coming, and
the group told the advance man to ask the gov to please stop by.</TE>
<TE>   An excited knot of volunteers waited ... and waited. A half-hour
later, after Davis made a speech "not 200 yards from our booth," he
sped off "without even a 30-second hello."</TE>

<TE>   Political Workers Campaign for Back Pay</TE>
<TE>   Muewhilestreles el dinero--show them the money.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two months after Yolanda Fuentes lost her Democratic
primary campaign to choose a Democratic candidate in the San Fernando
Valley's 39th Assembly District, some of her campaign
workers--students and workers, not party volunteers--are still
waiting to be paid.</TE>
<TE>   They've written letters--not only to Fuentes but to a couple of
her supporters, Los Angeles City Council President Alex Padilla and
Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City). And they've picketed
Cardenas' office, where Fuentes works as district director.</TE>
<TE>   (Here's the political food chain of this: Fuentes wanted to
replace her boss, Cardenas, who is termed out and who lost his try at
the L.A. City Council to Wendy Greuel. In turn, Fuentes was beaten in
the primary by San Fernando Mayor Cindy Montanez. Now, back to our
program....)</TE>
<TE>   Joaquin Meneses says the 40 or so workers, who started walking
precincts and working phone banks in January, have been paid
something but are still owed more than $1,000 each, and they really,
really need it. They've written and faxed letters, and they've tried
to set up meetings, he says.</TE>
<TE>   At one meeting that did come off, he says, "They told us they have
no money. Yolanda said she had only $10,000 and was going to divide
it accordingly. She said she didn't know when she could pay the rest,
six weeks or six months."</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes--who had the presence of mind to escape a carjacker as she
left Cardenas' office one night last summer--said, "I'm doing what I
can to raise the money to pay the debt I have. I understand their
frustration; I wasn't aware of the financial debt until after the
campaign.... I will honor those contracts."</TE>
<TE>   But exactly when, she can't say--maybe six weeks, maybe three
months.</TE>
<TE>   Montanez raised more than twice as much money and got twice as
many votes as Fuentes, and now, said Fuentes, "I do have some events
planned trying to raise money from family and friends. Want to come?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No One Will Know What Parks Had to Say</TE>
<TE>   Police reform was what departing Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard
C. Parks said he did well; the Police Commission begged to differ.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, in a set of interrogatories--that's Q&amp;A to you
and me--in a lawsuit against the city and the police, attorney
Stephen Yagman asked Parks, "Set forth separately, distinctly, and
fully, in descending order of importance to you, each thing that in
your view needs to be undertaken to reform the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   A deputy city attorney interjected: "Objection. Assumes facts not
in evidence. Nothing needs to be undertaken to reform the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever Parks might have wanted to answer is not on the record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Send in the Clones: Harry and Louise Redux</TE>
<TE>   Remember Harry and Louise, the cranky TV-commercial couple you
wouldn't want to live next door to because they were always
complaining about health-care coverage? The same ad firm that
produced those spots to help sink the Clinton health-care package is
bringing the couple back for an encore, for an ad campaign promoting
"therapeutic" cloning for medical research.</TE>
<TE>   The sponsor is CuresNow, a group founded by Hollywood figures
whose daughters have juvenile diabetes, one of the diseases that some
researchers think could benefit from human cloning study.</TE>
<TE>   Janet Zucker is producer of the comedy "Rat Race." Her husband,
Jerry, who directed "Ghost" and produced "The Naked Gun," directed
the ads--as a counterpunch, she says, to spots "placed by the far
right." Lucy Fisher, a former vice chairwoman of Sony Entertainment
("Gladiator," "Spy Game") said, "How can we explain to our children
that our government is now the greatest obstacle to a cure for their
disease?"</TE>
<TE>   An official at the National Right to Life Committee, which is
running its own anti-cloning spots in several states, denounced the
ads as a "brazen deception" and "these Hollywood manipulators know
it."</TE>
<TE>   Word is that the same political ad firm will be handling the
commercials for the secession movement to split the Valley from L.A.,
so watch for them--Harry vs. Louise.</TE>

<TE>   Congressional CPAs' Plan Went Down PDQ</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't wear a blue leotard with a huge "A" on his chest, but
Sherman Oaks' Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman is a proud member of the
accounting trade.</TE>
<TE>   In a lawyer-larded Congress, Sherman is one of only four CPAs, and
the only one on the House Financial Services Committee. His big
on-camera moment came in a House debate on an accounting and
corporate reform bill, when he put forth an amendment requiring the
Big Five accounting firms--maybe soon to be the Big Four--to carry
"malpractice insurance" against the sort of liability claims that
Andersen now faces.</TE>
<TE>   "A minimum amount of liability insurance is required in most
states to register a car," Sherman said. "A lot is riding on
accountants auditing publicly traded companies. They too should have
insurance."</TE>
<TE>   The amendment went down on a voice vote before the House passed a
GOP-made bill that some Democrats say went too easy on the Big Five.
All of the CPAs voted for the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Of his bread-and-butter trade before he got to Congress in 1996,
Sherman says, "Look, every profession has made mistakes. The Enron
mistakes were massive."</TE>
<TE>   Also in a past life, Sherman was a member of the state Board of
Equalization, making him an official tax collector, who ran for
Congress with the line, "Send Brad to Washington or he may come visit
you." Nowadays, the balding legislator hands out combs with the
suggestion, "You need them more than I do."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Clinton, who's landed a Los Angeles consulting job with his
pal and patron Ron Burkle, will make a trip to L.A. on May 9 for a
black-tie dinner ($125 to $2,000) honoring longtime African Methodist
Episcopal Bishop H.H. Brookins. The dinner chairman is the recently
politically invigorated Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   * Term-limits season is here when local politics look good.
Ex-Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle has held two fund-raisers on his old
Sacramento turf to run for mayor of Anaheim, where his family ran a
drapery biz for a quarter-century.</TE>
<TE>   * A Salinas fund-raiser for a candidate for sheriff fed supporters
22 pounds of tri-tip beef and other food that was the property of
Monterey County, according to a sheriff's investigation. A campaign
volunteer who was also the jail's food administrator has resigned in
the wake of Beef-Gate.</TE>
<TE>   * The L.A. Central City Assn.'s "treasure of the city" awards went
to, among others, the Dodgers, two Rays (Bradbury and Charles), and
Cardinal Roger Mahony, who is slogging through the priest-molestation
scandal and must feel more like sunken treasure.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "For California to pass a law to say, gee, you have to take a test
to get your diploma but you don't have to pass it, frankly will make
our state a laughingstock."</TE>
<TE>   --Villa Park Republican Assemblyman Bill Campbell, speaking of
legislation dismantling the state's system for testing students, a
part of which would have stopped requiring high school students to
pass an exit exam before they can graduate. That bit was dropped.</TE>

<HD>Priest Accused of Molesting 4 Retires Early</HD>
<DH>Religion: Cardinal Mahony says the allegations were made
long before his 'zero tolerance' policy took effect, and he expresses
sympathy for the cleric.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and BETH SHUSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 69-year-old Catholic priest assigned to the new cathedral in
downtown Los Angeles has been reported to police and forced to retire
by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony because of allegations that the priest
sexually abused four boys in the 1960s and 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   The retirement earlier this year of the Rev. Carl Sutphin came
more than a decade after a man said he notified officials of the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles that Sutphin had molested him and his
brother as children.</LD>
<LD>   The man, now 46, said he told church officials in 1989 that he and
one of his brothers were molested by Sutphin in the 1960s when the
priest worked at Maywood's St. Rosa of Lima church. Two years later,
he said, he wrote a letter to Cardinal Mahony making the same
allegations. "They promised me he'd retire and not be allowed to wear
a collar," the man said. The Times has a policy of not identifying
alleged sex crime victims unless they step forward publicly.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, in 1994, a Ventura County Catholic school teacher
reported to the archdiocese that her sons were molested on a 1976
fishing trip by Sutphin, then an Oxnard priest, said Jeffrey R.
Anderson, the family's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   "Cardinal Mahony talks about zero tolerance for priests who abuse
now. Well, where was zero tolerance when this mother went to the
church?" said Anderson, who also represents the brothers, who live in
Arizona and Texas. "For years he did nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said the allegations against Sutphin were made long before
implementation of his zero tolerance policy. The policy, adopted last
year, requires the removal of any priest involved in a single
instance of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Sutphin was one of seven priests who were forced to leave the
archdiocese this year because of allegations of sex abuse that
occurred prior to 1997, Mahony said. Sutphin's name was given to the
Los Angeles Police Department's Sexually Exploited Child Unit, an
archdiocese attorney said in a letter last week to the alleged
victims' lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he required Sutphin to retire several months before
his planned July retirement after reviewing sex abuse cases reported
to the L.A. archdiocese. Sutphin, who Mahony said is living outside
of Los Angeles, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt badly for all of [the priests forced to retire early], but
particularly for him because if this had been a few months from now,
he would have been gone anyway," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   But Mahony said Sutphin "understood what he had to do for the good
of the church."</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal said he had sent Sutphin for psychological treatment
years ago, after learning of abuse allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those cases where I felt he had followed the
treatment program successfully, honestly, and was rehabilitated to
the extent anyone can be rehabilitated," Mahony said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony transferred him to work in a Catholic retirement home as
chaplain before moving him to St. Vibiana's Cathedral to live and
work.</TE>
<TE>   "He was probably in the safest supervised situation," said Mahony,
who lived with Sutphin at St. Vibiana's before moving into the new
cathedral. "In some ways you couldn't have a safer place."</TE>
<TE>   Church records show Sutphin was assigned to the new Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels last March as associate pastor.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said Sutphin was bilingual, personable and "very good" with
the homeless, who often came to St. Vibiana's. Sutphin also
celebrated Mass at County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the attorney, said Mahony's handling of Sutphin is
similar to a case in the Stockton diocese when Mahony was in charge
there. Anderson in 1998 won a $30-million jury verdict for two
brothers molested by a priest, an amount later negotiated to $7
million.</TE>
<TE>   During the trial, records were produced that showed the priest,
Oliver O'Grady, was accused of molestation and then moved to another
parish, where he continued to molest.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was the bishop who moved O'Grady. The cardinal testified in
the civil trial that he was unaware of certain allegations against
the priest when he transferred him.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said Sutphin's alleged victims stepped forward because
they feared that Sutphin, like O'Grady, would target others.</TE>
<TE>   The 46-year-old Arizona man said he was molested by Sutphin
numerous times from 1964 through 1970. "The first time we were on
vacation with him," he said. "I think it was June Lake near Mammoth."
Sometimes, he said, it would be at Sutphin's parents' home in the
Santa Barbara area.</TE>
<TE>   The man's younger brother, 44, said he was molested in 1968 and
1969 by the priest. "I couldn't believe when I saw him in a photo
with a collar still on," said the man, who lives near Houston. "It
was mother's 80th birthday and someone had a recent picture of him."</TE>
<TE>   Another brother, now a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant, said
he recalled his brother revealing the molestation to the family in
the late 1980s, and later writing to archdiocese officials. "The
diocese promised he wouldn't wear a collar again," said the sergeant.
He added that Sutphin had helped preside at his 1984 wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he sent a letter to Mahony on April 11, detailing
the Ventura County allegations and asking that other accusations of
sexual misconduct against Sutphin be immediately given to police. He
also demanded Mahony answer a personal letter from the mother of the
Ventura County brothers.</TE>
<TE>   John McNicholas, an archdiocese attorney, replied in an April 22
letter that he advised Mahony not to write her.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, the mother, who said she spent 20 years teaching
religion in Catholic high schools, said she has been waiting years
for a "suitable response" from church officials.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote that in January 1994 one of her sons alleged he had been
sexually abused by Sutphin. Soon she learned that both of her sons
recalled being molested in 1976 when they spent the night with him
before a fishing trip. One boy, she alleged, was taken into the
priest's room--and then the other. "The one who went first till this
day feels he let his brother down for not telling him to stay put,"
she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   She said the next morning in 1994 she called Msgr. Terrance
Fleming to report the alleged abuse. Msgr. Timothy J. Dyer, who then
oversaw priests, called her back and took names. He called her sons
and invited them to Los Angeles. "Needless to say, they never made
the trip," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Dyer declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   At Thanksgiving that year, Sutphin "arrived at our door like
nothing had ever happened," she wrote. Her husband escorted him to
his car. The next day, she said, she reported his visit to church
officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I have heard the cardinal saying that he believes the church has
responded appropriately. I have to disagree," she wrote. "Any teacher
with those accusations made against them would have the police at
their doorsteps.... Father Carl took away the most precious gift we
had. The innocence of our children."</TE>
<TE>   The mother said she wonders why zero tolerance for sexual abuse by
priests was not imposed long ago. "I'd like to ask Cardinal Mahony,
does he know what this priest took away from us?" she said in an
interview.</TE>
<TE>   Jail is the place for such priests, she said. "If I committed this
crime that's where I'd be."</TE>
<TE>   One of her sons said he never told a soul until 1994. "I am going
to pursue it now," he said. "Changes have got to be made. There might
be another kid like me out there."</TE>

<HD>18 Razor Blades Are Found in Play Area</HD>
<DH>Crime: The discovery on Main Beach in Laguna follows a
phone tip that young people were planning to do harm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eighteen single-edged razor blades were found partly buried in the
sand at a playground in Laguna Beach on Sunday, just hours after
police received a tip that a group of youths were headed to that area
to "hurt people."</LD>
<LD>   An unidentified young woman who called police about 4 a.m. Sunday
said some of her friends--eight males and possibly a female--told her
they were going to Main Beach.</LD>
<LD>   She said the friends did not say exactly what they planned to do
when they got there, only that it involved injuring people, according
to police Sgt. Greg Bartz.</LD>
<TE>   A patrol officer was immediately sent there, but a search turned
up no signs of foul play.</TE>
<TE>   But at 8 a.m., a resident told a city worker at the beach that he
had found 17 razor blades partially buried in the sand near the
playground.</TE>
<TE>   Officers sent to the scene found one more blade, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The popular playground, on the south end of the beach, was secured
while the sand was raked and scanned with a metal detector. It was
reopened after authorities deemed it safe.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they do not believe that this discovery "is in any way
related" to similar ones in other Orange County playgrounds over the
past year.</TE>
<TE>   In those cases, razor blades were placed on swings, in sandboxes
and on slides at several parks in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured, but the culprit or culprits were never found.
The discoveries frayed the communities' nerves and sense of safety.
For a while, patrols were beefed up as some parents restricted their
children to playing in their own yards.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna police are asking that anyone with information call them at
(949) 497-0701.</TE>

<LD>The acquittals of four LAPD officers in the Rodney G. King beating
case 10 years ago today left the city stunned. Crowds gathered
angrily on street corners across the city, while thousands more
turned to their televisions to watch events unfold. The flash point
was a single gritty intersection in South-Central Los Angeles, but it
was a scene eerily repeated in many parts of Los Angeles in the hours
that followed.</LD>
<LD>   Here is a chronology of events between the verdicts and the end of
curfew five days later.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday</TE>
<TE>   April 29, 1992</TE>
<TE>   3:15 p.m.: Three LAPD officers are acquitted and one is partially
acquitted in the videotaped beating of motorist Rodney G. King,
setting off a powerful chain reaction.</TE>
<TE>   3:30 to 3:45 p.m.: The crowd outside the Simi Valley courthouse in
Ventura County swells to more than 300, most of them protesting the
verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   3:30 to 5 p.m.: Community activists and leaders meet to urge calm.</TE>
<TE>   5 to 6 p.m.: More than two dozen officers confront a growing crowd
near Florence and Normandie avenues in South-Central Los Angeles.
Outnumbered, police back off and do not return. The crowd vents its
anger on passing motorists.</TE>
<TE>   About 6:30 p.m.: Several hundred demonstrators gather outside
Parker Center, the police headquarters, in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   About 6:45 p.m.: In one of the most startling images of the riots,
truck driver Reginald O. Denny is pulled from his cab and severely
beaten. Four people, some of whom saw the beating on TV, come to his
aid.</TE>
<TE>   6 to 7 p.m.: Police begin arriving at a command post at a bus
depot at 54th Street and Arlington Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   6 to 8 p.m.: More than 2,000 gather for a peaceful rally at the

<TE>   6 to 8 p.m.: Looting and rioting begin in earnest. One of the
first targets: Tom's Liquor and Deli at Florence and Normandie.

National Guard to activate 2,000 reserve soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   About 9 p.m.: Bus service is shut down in portions of
South-Central Los Angeles at the request of the LAPD. The
restrictions eventually affect 27 bus lines throughout the area.</TE>
<TE>   About 9 p.m.: The demonstration outside Parker Center turns
violent as the crowd throws rocks, smashes windows and torches a
kiosk. Other demonstrators vandalize several downtown buildings and
snarl traffic on the Hollywood Freeway (101).</TE>
<TE>   9:05 p.m.: The California Highway Patrol closes exit ramps off the
Harbor Freeway (110) from the Santa Monica Freeway (10) junction to
Century Boulevard to keep unsuspecting motorists from wandering into
the path of violence. Eventually the closure is moved south,
stretching from Martin Luther King Boulevard to Imperial Highway.</TE>
<TE>   9:05 p.m.: The Federal Aviation Administration shifts the landing
pattern of jetliners approaching LAX for safety reasons, after the
LAPD notifies the FAA that a police helicopter was fired upon.</TE>
<TE>   About 9:15 p.m.: About 200 to 300 demonstrators gathered at Hansen
Dam Recreation Center in Lake View Terrace march to the nearby LAPD

enforcement to bring the trouble under control.</TE>
<TE>   About 6:30 p.m.: Long Beach declares a state of emergency and
imposes a 7 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew. But the move is not enough to protect
a Department of Motor Vehicles office that is burned to the ground.
Curfews are imposed in Carson, Culver City, Hawthorne, Hermosa Beach,
Huntington Park, Inglewood, Pomona, San Fernando, Torrance and West
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   A countywide curfew is imposed from the Long Beach Freeway (710)

<HD>Drivers OK Contract and End Walkout</HD>
<DH>Education: Workers are expected to return to school bus
routes today. Pact includes 3.5% raise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Striking Los Angeles school bus drivers are expected to be back at
work today after members of Teamsters Local 572 voted Sunday to end
their 26-day walkout and approve a contract that gives them pay
raises but leaves some health-care issues unresolved.</LD>
<LD>   The three-year contract with Laidlaw Education Services gives the
drivers a 3.5% annual wage increase--retroactive to August--and a
week of paid vacation each year. The union had sought a 5% annual
increase.</LD>
<LD>   Before the raise, Laidlaw drivers made $8 to $15 an hour.
District-employed drivers earn $13 to $24 an hour.</LD>
<TE>   During the strike, which affected nearly 20,000 students, the Los
Angeles Unified School District relied on smaller contractors and its
own buses and drivers to cover Laidlaw routes.</TE>
<TE>   Medical benefits, the final sticking point in the negotiations,
will be written into the contract after an arbitrator decides in
coming weeks whether to accept the union's medical plan or Laidlaw's
current plan.</TE>
<TE>   The union said its plan would provide coverage for every employee,
while the company's is so expensive that many drivers are forced to
rely on public assistance for their medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Only 35% of Laidlaw bus drivers are currently enrolled in the
medical program, according to union officials.</TE>
<TE>   Union negotiators agreed to leave the matter to arbitration after
obtaining a compromise that will allow for the creation of a fund to
help defray the drivers' medical insurance costs, said Rick
Middleton, the head of the union.</TE>
<TE>   Laidlaw representatives could not be reached for comment Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The bus drivers who gathered at Alexander Hamilton High School in
West Los Angeles voted 339 to 58 to end the strike, as the union
urged, despite some confusion over details of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I voted yes, because this is the best we could do," said Paul
Michels, 34, who has been with Laidlaw for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Cornejo, 24, said he voted against the contract because he
was extremely disappointed with the outcome of the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   "We stood in the picket lines for four weeks, and we didn't get
nothing," Cornejo said.</TE>
<TE>   Many drivers said that, although they didn't get everything they
asked for, the playing field has been leveled because the union
successfully flexed its muscle by making good on the threat to
strike.</TE>
<TE>   Some said the strike had hit them hard financially, and they were
eager to get back to work. Carmen Villezcas, who drives routes in
Tujunga, said she had been forced to cut corners by walking instead
of using her car.</TE>
<TE>   Strikers lost about 8% of their yearly income during the walkout,
according to union officials. They each received $55 a week in
compensation from the union's strike fund.</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, 842 drivers were on strike, but many crossed the
picket line in the final days of the strike and, by the end, there
were about 600 holdouts, union officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Gene Carnes, 61, said that the company has a long way to go to
make drivers happy.</TE>
<TE>   Morale is low, he said, partly because management treats the
drivers badly. "I've been here seven years, and morale has never been
high," Carnes said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, the agreement represents some progress. And Carnes
was all smiles as he thought about getting back to his routes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to be out there Monday and I'm going to do a lot of
apologizing," he said. "I really miss my kids."</TE>

<HD>Santa Ana Standoff Ends With Arrest</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man wanted on assault, abuse charges surrenders
quietly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a 4 1/2-hour standoff with SWAT officers, a Santa Ana man
facing charges of assaulting a police officer and spousal abuse
surrendered peacefully to authorities Sunday evening.</LD>
<LD>   Carlos Alberto Nuno, 22, walked out of his apartment wearing
shoes, pants and a baseball cap after police spent the afternoon
negotiating his surrender.</LD>
<LD>   The standoff began after officers knocked on Nuno's door about
1:15 p.m. Police had received an anonymous tip alleging a domestic
disturbance at Nuno's apartment in the 1500 block of Sycamore Street,
Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said.</LD>
<TE>   Nuno refused to open his door, cursing at officers and ordering
them to leave, De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   When police had responded to a similar report of domestic abuse a
year earlier, Nuno allegedly struck an officer with a lamp and fled,
De La Riva said. Authorities had an arrest warrant for Nuno alleging
assault with a deadly weapon on an officer, resisting arrest and
spousal abuse, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of Nuno's history, and because he refused to come out,
police evacuated the building and called in the department's SWAT
team.</TE>
<TE>   Nuno finally surrendered about 5:40 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Antoinette Ruiz, 28, who lives with Nuno, their 10-month-old
daughter, Felicia, and Ruiz's two other children, said Nuno did not
strike her Sunday. Neither she nor her children were home during the
standoff.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he was yelling loudly or just rapping to a song on the
radio or something," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "This whole thing could have been avoided if he had only just
opened the door and told them I wasn't home," Ruiz said.</TE>

California in order to construct a "primo" residence in West Los
Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Wesson's 500-bed proposal, planned for a site near the U.S.
Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the UCLA Medical School, is the
latest entry in the Legislature's long-running pork-barrel battle to
serve the state's expanding population of aging and ailing veterans.</LD>
<LD>   "This could be the biggest thing to happen in the veterans
community in I don't know how long," Wesson said last week, adding
that it would include a critically needed specialized care unit for
veterans suffering from Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<TE>   But what he calls the "primo of primo veterans facilities" in West
L.A. is causing political problems for some of his fellow Democrats
and drawing criticism from some Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   And lawmakers from both parties express concern that Wesson's
first major initiative as speaker would put a coveted project in his
own Culver City-based district at the expense of their own pet
veterans projects.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is Los Angeles put ahead in this bill?" Democratic
Assemblywoman Sarah Reyes of Fresno demanded at a hearing on the
measure (AB 2559) last week. She and other San Joaquin Valley
legislators have long lobbied for a vets' home in their region.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to get left in the dust again," said another San
Joaquin Valley Democrat, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Merced.</TE>
<TE>   California voters overwhelmingly approved a $50-million bond issue
in 2000 to finance veterans homes in Lancaster and the Ventura County
community of Saticoy. It also included $24 million for construction
of other vets' homes in the future. In addition, the federal
Department of Veterans Affairs pays 65% of the cost of building and
rehabilitating state-run veterans homes. State officials expect to
receive as much as $55 million next year from the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   It is uncertain now how much each of the homes at Lancaster,
Saticoy and West L.A. would cost. The bond issue authorized $26
million for two 400-bed facilities at Lancaster and Saticoy and
remodeling of the 114-year-old state home at Yountville, originally
built to shelter Civil War and Spanish American War vets.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Wesson bill, beds at both Lancaster and Saticoy would be
reduced to about 100 each, but the West L.A. facility would get 500.
The project has not been fully scrutinized by the Legislature,
including the budget committees.</TE>
<TE>   In advance of legislative action, the Davis administration quietly
sought federal approval of the West L.A. project as a mere "change in
scope" in plans for the Lancaster home. It was rejected this month by
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs on grounds that the change
was "so different" that the L.A. home would require an entirely new
application of its own.</TE>
<TE>   A high-level advisory committee strongly recommended the West L.A.
facility to Davis last year, noting that about 30% of the state's
veterans live in Los Angeles and Orange counties and that some will
soon need residential and medical facilities close by.</TE>
<TE>   Wesson said these vets would receive medical care from UCLA
physicians, whom he called "the best docs in the world." The
residents also could play golf on a nine-hole course, watch UCLA
baseball games at an adjacent ball field, worship at three on-campus
churches and have access to a public bus system.</TE>
<TE>   But Wesson's plan raised the suspicions of Sen. William "Pete"
Knight (R-Palmdale), a retired Air Force pilot who overcame eight
years of political and bureaucratic setbacks before getting a vets'
home approved for Lancaster.</TE>
<TE>   At a hearing of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee last week,
Knight said he feared the Lancaster home would fall victim to a power
grab.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said he shared Knight's fears and
deplored what he saw as "gamesmanship" surrounding the Wesson bill.</TE>
<TE>   The committee approved a companion bill (SB 1234) by Sen. Maurice
Johannessen (R-Redding) that would commit the state to financing one
veterans home at Redding and another at Fresno with lease-revenue
bonds at some time in the future. This bill is aimed at placating
lawmakers such as Reyes and Cardoza and creating a hometown legacy
for the retiring Johannessen.</TE>
<TE>   The committee also approved a separate bill (SB 1773) by Sen. Wes
Chesbro (D-Arcata) that would earmark $15 million for completion of
the remodeling of the Yountville home.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, there are three state-operated veterans homes in
California: at Yountville, Barstow and Chula Vista. Two expandable
facilities have been approved for Lancaster and Saticoy, while the
West L.A. project would become the sixth. The Fresno and Redding
homes would become the seventh and eighth.</TE>

<LD>A 64-year-old man who got lost when he wandered from his Ojai
residential care facility was found Sunday in a wooded ravine after
spending a chilly night outdoors, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis "Steve" Gertsman sustained a minor head injury and was
"cold and lethargic" when he was found about 8:30 a.m. by a Ventura
County Sheriff's Department search-and-rescue team, said Senior
Deputy Julie Smith. Fifty rescue workers took part in the search.</LD>
<LD>   Gertsman, wearing a purple jogging suit and an identification tag,
walked out of the Casa Blanca Residential Care Facility on Rockaway
Road about 6 p.m. Saturday, Smith said. Overnight temperatures had
dipped into the high 40s.</LD>
<TE>   He was taken to Ojai Valley Community Hospital, where he was
treated and released.</TE>
<TE>   The facility has a locked gate, but employees told investigators
it does not always close properly, Smith said.</TE>

<HD>Pulling Rug Out From Recession</HD>
<DH>Economy: From factory to showroom to living room, spending on home
furnishings is boosting many companies and helping fuel the recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SIOBHAN HUGHES</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Abrahams smiled as he pointed out the chrome curves of his
new leather chair, the latest addition to the Brooklyn, N.Y., apartment
he and his wife bought in January.</LD>
<LD>  "We're doing our little part for the economy," Abrahams said,
describing recent purchases from IKEA, the world's largest retailer of
home furnishings, and Rico, a local store that specializes in lamps,
chairs and sofas.</LD>
<LD>  The example of the 33-year-old public relations executive and his
living room shows how the U.S. benefits from a strong housing market as
the economy emerges from recession.</LD>
<TE>  After low mortgage rates led to record sales of 6.21 million houses and
738,000 previously owned condominiums last year, Americans are busy
spending on furniture, fixtures and decorative items to fill them. And
that is helping to fuel the next phase of recovery.</TE>
<TE>  "There is a clear acceleration in purchases of these items," said Dan
Seto, senior economist at Sumitomo Life Investment Co. in New York.
"Things are really beginning to get hopping."</TE>
<TE>  The effect is evident from factory to showroom to living room.
Production of appliances, furniture and carpeting rose at a 6.3% annual
rate in the first quarter, the first quarterly increase in at least a
year, the Federal Reserve said.</TE>
<TE>  Leggett &amp; Platt Inc., the world's largest maker of springs, wires and
fabric for furniture, said earlier this month that first-quarter profit
rose 22% andsecond-quarter profit would be better than forecast.</TE>
<TE>  "We're well-positioned to take advantage of a sustained recovery," said
Felix Wright, the company's president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>  To keep up with orders, Hooker Furniture Inc. of Martinsville, Va., is
running overtime at two factories.</TE>
<TE>  "Demand has certainly picked up," said Larry Ryder, executive vice
president of the maker of home entertainment centers. "We look forward to
a pretty good year."</TE>
<TE>  Sales at home furnishings stores rose at a 10.9% annual pace during the
first quarter, up from a 10.1% rate in the last three months of 2001 and
a 2.5% rate of decline in the quarter before that, the Commerce
Department said.</TE>
<TE>  That has bolstered the outlook for some companies. Williams-Sonoma
Inc., owner of the Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma chains, this month
raised earnings estimates for the quarter and the year. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
Inc., the largest U.S. household goods retailer, also raised its earnings
forecasts this month.</TE>
<TE>  Home improvement stores also are seeing sales pick up.</TE>
<TE>  "The housing industry has been the one bright spot in the U.S.
economy," said James Hopwood, chief financial officer at Wickes Inc.
"Combining low interest rates, historical lows in the inventory of unsold
homes and a reasonable demand for housing over the next several years,
Wickes should benefit."</TE>
<TE>  Sales of new homes fell last month to an annual rate of 878,000 from
906,000 in February, the Commerce Department said last week. And the
National Assn. of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes
fell to an annual rate of 5.4 million in March from 5.88 million in
February.</TE>
<TE>  Still, resales had the best two months on record in January and
February, and some builders remain optimistic that sales will meet or
exceed last year's levels, even if interest rates do rise.</TE>
<TE>  That would mean that spending on home furniture may have room to keep
growing.</TE>
<TE>  "It ought to turn out to be another record year," said Timothy Eller,
chairman of Centex Corp.'s primary home building operation. "Job
formation will begin to return as the economy recovers and with that
consumer confidence, and we think that will offset the rise in interest
rates."</TE>

<HD>A Changed Landscape Lies Outside Arafat's Door</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>When Yasser Arafat steps out of his ravaged base in the West Bank
for the first time in months, he may not recognize what he sees.</LD>
<LD>   Assuming a U.S.-brokered deal takes effect and the siege on Arafat's
compound is lifted, the Palestinian Authority president will tread into a
physical and political wasteland, a West Bank devastated by three weeks
of assault by the most powerful army in the Middle East.</LD>
<LD>   Israel says it launched the offensive to root out terrorists
responsible for a horrific wave of suicide bombings. In its wake, the
Israeli army left the ruins of government buildings, private homes,
schoolrooms, police stations and electrical grids. In addition to
rounding up suspected militants and confiscating caches of weapons, the
army seized or destroyed payrolls, school records, computers and cars.</LD>
<TE>   How Arafat will begin to rebuild any part of the quasi-state he
governed not long ago is a mystery. Despite assurances to the contrary
from negotiators, his movements are likely to remain tightly restricted.
Israel also destroyed his helicopters and dug up the runway of the only
Palestinian airport.</TE>
<TE>   Mounds of rubble and debris line the roads leading to his compound in
Ramallah, where the outer walls have been pulverized by Israeli armor.
More important, his political and security apparatuses are in utter
disarray, with key aides hobbled or jailed and most police forces
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, Arafat has endured extreme humiliation and been forced to
rely on the Israelis for food and to seek their permission for his rare
visitors. He has been confined to a few rooms inside one aging building,
where electricity was sporadic and the toilets regularly backed up.</TE>
<TE>   However, from Arafat's perspective, that he is emerging at all from
this punishment is a victory.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's confinement pitted him against his historical enemy, Ariel
Sharon. Two decades ago, Sharon enforced a siege on Arafat and his
cronies from the Palestine Liberation Organization in Beirut, where they
ran a "state within a state" to launch cross-border attacks into Israel.
Under U.S. auspices, Arafat emerged after 88 days and went into exile in
Tunisia, where he resurrected his nationalist movement.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, he is going to have enormous problems," said one U.S.
official. "But he has a few things going for him. That he survived at all
is something of a miracle."</TE>
<TE>   Arafat's stature among his own people--where his popularity had
plummeted last year--has been enhanced by his confinement. And that's
despite his inability to visit stricken areas or to communicate widely
with the population.</TE>
<TE>   The compromise to end the siege provides for the Palestinians
convicted of killing right-wing Israeli Cabinet minister Rehavam Zeevi to
be transferred to a Palestinian prison and placed under U.S. and British
guard. The same fate would await Arafat's top financial aide, Fuad
Shubaki, who Israel alleges is the Palestinians' top weapons smuggler.</TE>
<TE>   The men had been holed up in the Ramallah compound with Arafat; Israel
refused to leave without them, and Arafat refused to give them up.</TE>
<TE>   By accepting the compromise, both Arafat and Sharon submitted to
considerable U.S. and British pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon, especially, gave ground, perhaps to balance the hard line he
and his government are taking to prevent a United Nations probe into its
military operations in the Jenin refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commentators Sunday night portrayed Sharon as the capitulator
in the Ramallah standoff. Just days ago, he was so adamant about
demanding the extradition of Zeevi's killers that he told Secretary of
State Colin L. Powell that he was willing to hold new elections over the
matter.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said he did not trust Arafat--whom he accuses of promoting
terrorism--to punish the killers or even to jail them for any period of
time, since criminals who go into Palestinian cells often get out rather
quickly. An ad hoc Palestinian military court, convening inside Arafat's
compound last week, sentenced the men to prison terms ranging from one to
18 years, but Israelis branded the proceedings a sham.</TE>
<TE>   With President Bush literally on the telephone, however, Sharon
relented Sunday. In recent weeks, Sharon had repeatedly ignored Bush's
pleas to withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank. Sharon may have
decided that another refusal would be one too many.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon pushed the decision through a long and torturous session of his
Cabinet on Sunday. Hard-line hawk Avigdor Lieberman was among those who
complained.</TE>
<TE>   "The moment we let in foreign troops," Lieberman said, referring to
the proposed American and British guards, "we're lost."</TE>
<TE>   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Sharon's archrival within
the right-wing Likud Party, took to the evening television newscasts to
denounce the prime minister's compromise.</TE>
<TE>   "The one question I find hardest to answer," he said, "is, 'Why don't
you exile Arafat?' . . . Now Arafat will return to Gaza and be treated
like a hero."</TE>
<TE>   But Ephraim Sneh, a Cabinet minister from the more moderate Labor
Party, said it made sense to grant Bush's request and to "keep America on
our side."</TE>

<DH>Surrounded by armed guards and high walls, the San Quentin Giants,
an inmate baseball team, always have the home-field advantage.</DH>

<DL>SAN QUENTIN, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>They're a ragtag baseball team that plays all home games, 20 men
with criminal records and donated uniforms. They gallop around a gut-ugly
dirt diamond where foul balls bounce off guard towers and umpires take
the heckles of unruly fans dead seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Theirs is a home-field advantage so imposing that opponents sometimes
fail to show up. Their own coach can't fill out his lineup card until
game time because he never knows which starters have been sent to the
hole or confined to lock-down.</LD>
<LD>   Forget Ruth and Gehrig: This team lines up as a real "Murderer's Row,"
the killers, thieves and con men who make up San Quentin prison's inmate
baseball team.</LD>
<TE>   This month, as the national pastime eases into full swing from
neighborhood sandlots to Major League Baseball parks, the San Quentin
Giants begin their ninth season competing in a walled-off league of their
own. In 25 games, they will take on college teams and senior leaguers
brave enough to submit to pregame equipment searches and play under the
gaze of guards armed with high-powered rifles.</TE>
<TE>   The KC Monarchs, an over-40 Bay Area squad, faced the Giants in the
season opener last week. Before entering San Quentin's penned-in lower
yard, they were warned that authorities will cut no deals to negotiate
for visiting players' lives should they be taken hostage. Once inside,
catcalls and animal noises rained down from the leering all-inmate fans.</TE>
<TE>   As the visitors stretched before the game, Monarch infielder Tim
Knittle said the Giants know how to play. Then he glanced toward the
turreted prison towers. "But those fans. They'll eat you alive."</TE>
<TE>   For the Giants, the games provide more than just a release of pent-up
prison tension. Team coach and prison minister Kent Philpott says they're
an opportunity for his players to compete against "free men," to show not
only athletic prowess but demonstrate that they can, for a while at
least, again play a game as if they were still boys.</TE>
<TE>   "After so many years behind bars, these players wonder if they can
even relate to people from the outside--they worry they'll be rejected
because they're convicts," Philpott says. "These games give them a chance
to walk among free men. Even if it's just for nine innings."</TE>
<TE>   On opening night, inmate Vernis Brown, in for second-degree burglary,
blows the national anthem on a borrowed trumpet, hitting a few sour notes
that nobody seems to hear.</TE>
<TE>   Standing along the third-base line, their backs to the three-story
cellblocks that also house California's death row, the bad boys of summer
mouth the words to "The Star-Spangled Banner." They hold "SQ" logo caps
over their chests.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is big Tony Gonzales, the Giants' ace pitcher, who can
throw a 90-mph fastball and who once tried out for the minor leagues
before trouble that he won't now discuss entered his life. Larry "Popeye"
Faison, at 51 the oldest Giants player, is a veteran of eight seasons
while he does time for second-degree murder. And reliever Andrew Zingler,
a three-strikes offender with a wild John Rocker glint, can fire heat
from the mound.</TE>
<TE>Shaking Off Claims of Over-Aggressiveness</TE>
<TE>   Mustachioed David Marshall, a utility infielder serving a first-degree
murder sentence, shrugs his shoulders at claims of over-aggressive Giants
pitching. "Hey, a brushback is a brushback, whether it's Kevin Brown or
some prison inmate throwing the ball."</TE>
<TE>   There's shortstop Eugene Carlisle, a compact man Philpott calls
"simply the best baseball player I have ever shared a field with." This
is Carlisle's second stint with the Giants. In 1996, in his "rookie"
year--he won't say what landed him behind bars then--he set a team home
run record with 13 blasts in just half a season, with a natural swing
that had Giants coaches telephoning minor league scouts.</TE>
<TE>   But soon after Carlisle's parole, he returned to San Quentin on an
involuntary-manslaughter conviction. Now 30, he believes he still has a
major-league future, but teammates sadly shake their heads about his
missed chances. "They don't send baseball scouts to San Quentin," one
says. "Just U.S. marshals."</TE>
<TE>   Giants third baseman Jesse Reed, serving time on a murder conviction,
describes the feeling of changing from his prison blues into a real-life
baseball uniform.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nights in your cell when you dream about moments like this,"
he says. "We're not locked up when we're out here. No matter if you're a
prisoner, a cop or some suburban husband, we all love this game like
there's no tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Zingler: "Nobody will ever say they're having fun in prison. But
these games are truly something positive in a negative world." He looks
at his teammates. "I'm proud to play alongside these guys, no matter what
crimes they've committed."</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs, a veteran group of Bay Area professionals, wonder how
many bad San Quentin bounces are in store for them tonight. Inmate umps
call the action, and at San Quentin, there are no lights or scoreboard,
and orange cones serve as a virtual outfield wall, which leaves room for
interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're winning and the sun starts to set, we have to play until the
very last ray," says Monarch pitcher Rick Maida. "But if the inmates are
up, that game gets called faster than a three-card monte game."</TE>
<TE>   As the game gets underway, the home crowd goes right to work on
46-year-old Monarch starter Johnny Ball, who quickly loads the bases. One
inmate implores Brown to blow taps on his trumpet "because this pitcher's
a goner."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as it often does at San Quentin, controversy strikes.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants' Carlisle hits a towering drive, which is caught by the
Monarchs center fielder. But as Carlisle trots toward the bench, an ump
signals a home run, declaring that the drive cleared one of the outfield
cones.</TE>
<TE>   Monarchs third baseman Nick Knowles kicks the dirt in disgust, evoking
jeers from the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, many of California's 33 prisons have also fielded
inmate teams, but San Quentin is one of only two that play outside
opponents. The team's present incarnation began in 1994 when Earl Smith,
another San Quentin prison chaplain, noticed an inmate carrying a
catcher's mitt and asked him if he knew how to use it.</TE>
<TE>   That meeting eventually produced a team nicknamed the Pirates. But
when Smith, who also works as a chaplain with the San Francisco Giants,
convinced the professional team to donate its practice uniforms to the
prison, the new San Quentin Giants were born.</TE>
<TE>   Composed of both "lifers" and short-timers, the team's 2002 version
was winnowed from 60 hopefuls, some of whom lost interest when they
learned that making the squad meant having to keep up the baseball
diamond.</TE>
<TE>   Philpott is proud of his team: "Most of these guys did something
stupid to rob themselves of their early manhood. But when they step onto
that field, they're baseball players, not prisoners."</TE>
<TE>   While the Giants have never had a losing season, their worst loss was
a 25-4 shellacking that came when several starters could not make the
game because their cellblock was locked down.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Philpott has rallied his team by appealing to their baser
natures. "We'll be losing to some young team and I'll tell them to start
playing like convicts and intimidate their opponents."</TE>
<TE>   Most visitors are already menaced. "It's sobering when that iron gate
closes behind you," says Jim Meehan, an Oakland attorney whose team, the
Oaks, plays annual games at the prison. "When the game is over, we
cherish our visitor status."</TE>
<TE>   Meehan recalls the time an alarm sounded during a game and everyone
immediately hit the turf. "People started yelling at us to get down. We
didn't know that the alarm meant the guards in the towers could use their
guns to quell some disturbance."</TE>
<TE>   Once, two visiting players got into a fistfight with each other until
they were warned off by a gun-toting guard.</TE>
<TE>   But it is the fans, not the guards, who command the most attention.</TE>
<TE>   Inmates wearing blue denim uniforms and knit skull caps peer through
the chain-link fence within a few feet of visiting players. And they make
their presence felt.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our guys who carries a few extra pounds was greeted by a
chorus of farm animal noises," Meehan says. "It got to him."</TE>
<TE>   The prison doesn't allow huge crowds, just the 100 or so men scheduled
to use the adjacent exercise yard on game nights.</TE>
<TE>   In pregame warmups, Zingler says fan wrath cuts both ways: "It's a
no-mercy crowd. But they get on us, too. If we mess up, they know where
to find us after the game."</TE>
<TE>   As the evening wears on, the lack of a scoreboard becomes a factor.
Few observers, umpires included, seem sure of the inning, or the score.
Some fans shout that the Giants lead by six runs.</TE>
<TE>   The Monarchs believe that they score a run, but an umpire waves it
off, saying the base runner crossed home on the third out.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the Monarchs pull to within a run. As the sun dips below
the west wall, a few Giants players scurry to pack up equipment.</TE>
<TE>   They must soon return to their cell blocks. More hard time awaits.</TE>
<TE>   One Monarch cruelly goads a silent Giants bench: "Man, I can't wait to
go out and party tonight!"</TE>
<TE>   When the game is finally called with the Giants leading 5-4, both
teams meet at home plate for the traditional handshakes.</TE>
<TE>   Giants supporter Wolf Stipe, a convicted first-degree murderer who
co-founded the team, basks in the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "We showed these other players our human side," he says. "Now we can
go back inside our cages and feel good about ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow, a sense of pride inside San Quentin. Go figure."</TE>

<HD>State GOP Sought Donations From Enron</HD>
<DH>Politics: Requests brought in $50,000 during probe of the energy
firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIRGINIA ELLIS</AU>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO
</DL>
<LD>Republican legislative leaders solicited tens of thousands of
dollars in campaign donations from Enron Corp. even as the state
government was investigating the company and other producers suspected of
price gouging and market manipulation during last year's energy crisis,
according to internal Enron documents.</LD>
<LD>   As state investigators probed Enron's business dealings, Sen. Jim
Brulte and Assemblyman Dave Cox, the two GOP floor leaders, appealed to
the company for contributions and were rewarded with checks, said the
confidential company records obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   "Enron gave $50K to the Rep party at Brulte and Cox's request," wrote
Enron's Sacramento lobbyist in an October 2001 memo. State records
disclose that the funds arrived in August as lawmakers were wrapping up
their energy legislation.</LD>
<TE>   Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, denied Friday that he solicited money
from Enron on the party's behalf. A spokesman for Cox, of Fair Oaks,
defended the assemblyman's appeal for contributions as nothing out of the
ordinary. Neither the contributions nor the solicitation of them is a
violation of campaign-finance law.</TE>
<TE>   Although the party reported the contributions as required by law, the
documents detail a relationship between Republican leaders and the
now-failed energy giant that neither the company nor the state GOP has
ever publicly acknowledged. Indeed, during this spring's primary
campaign, the Republican candidates for governor all criticized Gov. Gray
Davis for accepting nearly $120,000 from Enron.</TE>
<TE>   A memo to managers at Enron's landmark skyscraper headquarters in
Houston said the donations given at Cox and Brulte's request would
entitle company executives to a place at the table of an Oct. 29 luncheon
that the generator industry planned for the two Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "Expect Brulte and Cox to push us for another 75K," the internal Enron
memo warned.</TE>
<TE>   Enron executives in Texas were urged to attend because the political
picture in California was changing rapidly. GOP gubernatorial contender
Richard Riordan, the former mayor of Los Angeles, appeared to be on the
rise in opinion polls while Democrat Davis was in trouble over his
management of the energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent
announcement and potential, and the fact that the R's [Republicans in the
Legislature] have played it about as well as could be expected under the
circumstances . . . this could be a useful gathering," said the memo by
Jeff Dasovich, an Enron government relations executive.</TE>
<TE>   Dasovich said the only Republican to speak out against the energy
producers during the energy crunch was Sen. Bill Morrow of Oceanside. "We
may want to bring [that] up with Brulte," he advised Enron colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   The unpublicized private luncheon would have the added advantage of
occurring far from Sacramento, he said. "And it doesn't require crossing
the border into California, to boot."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) has alleged that Enron influenced GOP
lawmakers, but they have denied it.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, now in bankruptcy but once so powerful that its influence
reached around the globe, played a pivotal role in California's
calamitous 1996 decision to deregulate its energy market. The company's
aggressive campaign to assert itself as a leader in the deregulated
environment last year brought accusations from consumer advocates, Davis
and other Democrats that Enron and others had "gamed" the newly
deregulated market and gouged Californians with astronomical prices.</TE>
<TE>   By soliciting contributions for their party rather than their own
campaigns, legislators and other officeholders are able to obtain
donations from unpopular interests without ever having to disclose their
role in raising the money.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Denne, an Enron corporate spokeswoman, said Saturday that she
was unfamiliar with specifics of the $50,000 contribution and internal
memos but she knew the company was being solicited for contributions as
the Legislature and Davis wound up action on energy crisis bills.</TE>
<TE>   She said she believed the appeals for funds by Brulte and Cox were no
more "aggressive than those of other members of the Senate and Assembly."</TE>
<TE>   A Republican Party spokesman confirmed that Cox and Sen. Ray Haynes
(R-Riverside) traveled to Houston for the lunch. Brulte did not attend
because of illness.</TE>
<TE>   The affair was hosted by R. Steven Letbetter, chairman of Reliant
Energy, another Texas-based producer, and was aimed at giving industry
executives a political update on California. Enron officials, who by then
were coping with the financial collapse of their company, did not attend.</TE>
<TE>   "The event in Houston was not a fund-raiser per se," said GOP
spokesman Rob Stutzman, "[but] we want to be clear that the hope was that
the companies would contribute money."</TE>
<TE>   He defended the decision to seek donations from energy companies, then
a highly unpopular industry, saying that if any violated laws during the
power crisis, state and federal investigators would take the appropriate
action.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the laws are changed, generators are still part of the solution
to keeping our lights on," Stutzman said. "We think it would be foolish
to treat them as pariahs."</TE>
<TE>   Brulte said in an interview Friday that he never solicited
contributions specifically from Enron. He said it was a party aide who
approached the company for donations.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was part of his duties as a party leader to raise money for
the GOP. He and Cox regularly appear at fund-raising events staged by the
party and have so far raised about $3 million, Brulte said.</TE>
<TE>   Cox was reported unavailable for comment on this story. His spokesman,
Peter DeMarco, said he was unaware of the details of the timing of the
Enron contribution, but defended Cox's role.</TE>
<TE>   "The generators are doing business in California. Part of the world of
the leaders is to go and secure funds for their candidates," DeMarco
said. He denied as "mischaracterization" the notion that Cox pressured
Enron for donations.</TE>
<TE>   At their state convention in February, Republicans assailed Davis for
accepting $119,500 in Enron contributions over the last five years. They
demanded that he return it. Davis refused, saying that he took his last
contribution of $10,000 from Enron in May 2000, a few months before the
power crisis began.</TE>
<TE>   Asked at the time about the $50,000 donation to the California GOP,
Party Chairman Shawn Steel said he would strongly recommend that the
money be returned. "I don't think we should keep their money at all," he
told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The party has never returned the money.</TE>
<TE>   "To do so requires an action by the board of directors of the party
and the board has not taken such action at this time and I do not believe
intends to at this time," spokesman Stutzman said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   One consumer advocate who lobbied during the energy crisis, Douglas
Heller, recalled that Republican lawmakers pushed for legislation
embraced by energy producers, including relaxing environmental
regulations to encourage more power plant construction, a move Davis
later agreed to.</TE>
<TE>   Heller said he believed at the time it was a political mistake for the
Republicans not to put more distance between themselves and the energy
producers.</TE>
<TE>   "They pointed fingers at Davis while continuing to present Enron's
policy argument as their own," said Heller, who represented the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "The Republicans were given
a free ticket to escape culpability for the deregulation debacle because
it fell on Davis' watch and he bumbled his way through it. They refused,
however, to stand with consumers and fight the energy companies."</TE>
<TE>   In testimony to Congress earlier this month, Dunn, who heads a
committee investigating alleged price gouging, said confidential records
from Enron's governmental affairs department suggested a "very close"
relationship between the company and unnamed leaders of the Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   "On the one hand, California's legislative leaders appealed directly
to Enron for contributions and on the other received explicit instruction
about specific legislation," Dunn testified.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to elaborate Saturday, citing confidentiality restrictions.
But he said the legislative leaders he had in mind were "primarily from
the Republican side of the aisle. I'm not aware of any Democrats that
made such an appeal to Enron."</TE>
<TE>   Dunn refused to discuss his allegation that Enron issued orders to
lawmakers on bills. He said he hopes to reach agreement with Enron soon
on resolving confidentiality conflicts and intends to publicly disclose
evidence to substantiate his allegation.</TE>

<HD>A Decade Later, Residents More Upbeat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>One in a series about the 1992 riots
</SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The passage of time has smoothed some of the edges that the 1992
Los Angeles riots carved into citizens' psyches.</LD>
<LD>   During the decade that has passed since the city endured three days of
looting and burning and 54 deaths, residents gradually have come to view
their city more positively, a Los Angeles Times poll has found.</LD>
<LD>   Angelenos express more satisfaction with their communities and the
Police Department, and see the city as less racially divided than in the
months and first few years after the rioting. Fewer are inclined to view
the riots as unjustified.</LD>
<TE>   Blacks continue to have a grimmer outlook on the city than other
groups, a historical tendency attributed to a legacy of discrimination.
But in this poll, their views generally were less negative than
previously.</TE>
<TE>   "People are feeling better about their city than at any time since the
riots," said Susan Pinkus, director of the Times Poll.</TE>
<TE>   The riots, America's deadliest in the 20th century, broke out 10 years
ago today after a jury did not return guilty verdicts against any of the
four Los Angeles Police Department officers whose videotaped beating of
Rodney G. King stunned the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The violence destroyed businesses and other property in largely poor
and minority neighborhoods, and set off a years-long conversation about
the consequences of Los Angeles' diversity and the gulf between affluent
and poor residents.</TE>
<TE>   A solid majority--69%--now feels the city has made at least some
progress toward the question King posed at his first public appearance on
the third day of the rioting: "Can we all get along?" Twenty-six percent
said they saw little or no progress, while 5% said they did not know.
Five years ago, however, 53% said the city had made progress toward its
different racial groups getting along with one another, while 41% said
little or none.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the sense that progress has been made cuts across all three
major racial groups and registers throughout the city: 74% of whites, 70%
of blacks (contrasted with just 45% five years ago) and 60% of Latinos
reported progress. Geographically, that sentiment was voiced by 75% of
those living in the San Fernando Valley, 69% each of Westsiders and
residents of the southern part of the city and 61% of those living in the
central neighborhoods of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "People have become a little more conscious that you need to be a
little more patient, a little more observant, that [a member of a
different racial group] is a human being," Laurie Dowling, 45, a San
Fernando Valley resident, said in a follow-up interview. Dowling said she
attends a multicultural, multiracial church on the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   But a more specific question on the quality of race relations drew
less effusiveness.</TE>
<TE>46% Call Relations Good</TE>
<TE>   Only 46% described race relations as good, while 51% said not good.
Among whites, 51% said race relations were good, but only 30% of blacks
and 45% of Latinos agreed with that assessment. Still, that is a much
rosier view than the prevailing outlook six months after the riots, when
82% of Angelenos felt race relations were not good; five years later,
that number, while still a strong majority, had slid to 67%.</TE>
<TE>   A solid majority, 78%, feel Los Angeles has recovered emotionally at
least somewhat from the riots, although fewer blacks, 67%, hold that view
than do Latinos, 85%, and whites, 77%.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has kind of settled down and [is] trying to get along with
everybody else, trying to adjust themselves to whatever is going on,"
said Shirley Washington, 63, a housewife who lives in one of the
South-Central Los Angeles neighborhoods where the rioting was intense.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people are quite as frustrated as they were then," said
Pamela Williams, 68, who lives in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Today, slightly more people than previously say the term "riot" best
describes the events. Overall, a small majority, 54%, of residents chose
"riot" while 33% preferred "rebellion." Among racial groups, however,
whites chose "riot" over "rebellion" 71% to 19%, while blacks favored
"rebellion" 55% to 35%--a division that also was reflected in news
accounts years after the 1965 Watts riots. Latinos were more narrowly
divided: 45% said "rebellion" while just 38% chose "riot."</TE>
<TE>   People are divided in their opinions on the root causes of the
riots--nearly one-third of those surveyed blamed a small criminal element
for the looting and burning. Eighteen percent said the rioting was
primarily to protest the verdicts in the King beating case.</TE>
<TE>   "Police people did too much to black people, and the black people
fought back in the same way," said Albert Ibaraki, 69, who has lived near
downtown Los Angeles for 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Polly Stevens, 73, a retired teacher who lives on the Westside, said
she watched Court TV coverage of the trial of the four officers who beat
King and was stunned when none was convicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Many of the rioters were people who would not ordinarily do that sort
of thing, but they felt they were entitled" because of the verdicts,
Stevens said. "It was a very sorry thing."</TE>
<TE>   One-fifth cited economic injustice as the root cause, while another
one-fifth said it was a combination of all three factors. About
three-fourths agreed that the riots were not just about the verdicts, but
reflected the culmination of injustices felt then by most blacks every
day living in the city.</TE>
<TE>   While two-thirds of all residents--and 88% of blacks--disapproved of
the verdicts, a majority, 58%, said the riots were unjustified, and the
responses for each of the three racial groups were about the same as
residents as a whole. Five years earlier, a significantly larger
proportion of residents--71%--felt the riots were unjustified.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't condone the crimes that were committed," said Valley resident
Ernest Fuentes, 77, "but most of the people who did these bad things had
no other way of expressing their frustration."</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes, an ambulance driver for the city during the 1950s and '60s,
said he witnessed many incidents of police brutality and discrimination
against blacks in those days and does not believe racism has been
overcome within the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of residents who lived in or near the riot zone said there
were businesses in their neighborhoods that still have not reopened. In
the southern quadrant of the city, which includes many of the hardest hit
neighborhoods, 55% reported unreplaced businesses, as did 65% of blacks.</TE>
<TE>LAPD Comes Under Fire</TE>
<TE>   The rioting was a watershed event for the Police Department as much as
for the city as a whole because it brought to the surface long-smoldering
resentment and accusations of police racism. The rioting--and the LAPD's
slow initial response to it--cost a longtime police chief his job,
tarnished the department's image and spawned an ongoing drive to reform
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, a Times poll taken shortly after the riots showed
only 40% of residents--and only 23% of blacks--approved of how the LAPD
was doing its job.</TE>
<TE>   In the current poll, however, the LAPD's performance got a thumbs up
from 62% of Angelenos, including a narrow majority, 51%, of blacks and
from 65% of whites and 60% of Latinos. Moreover, 81% said they had a
favorable impression of the department's efforts to hold down crime in
their communities. Police got high marks throughout the city. But among
racial groups, somewhat fewer blacks (69%) rated the department's
activities favorably than did Latinos (85%) and whites (84%).</TE>
<TE>   Blacks also expressed a different experience with the LAPD's community
outreach efforts. Only 48% said they viewed the department's activities
favorably, while the department's efforts got favorable marks from 74% of
Latinos and 62% of whites.</TE>
<TE>   But a majority--57%--of Angelenos believe racist feelings are at least
somewhat common among LAPD officers. Not surprisingly in the wake of the
Rampart Division corruption scandal and intense debate over "racial
profiling" in traffic stops and arrests, that view is most strongly held
by Latinos (68%) and blacks (65%), while 48% of whites agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also revealed wide differences in how the various groups
perceive the incidence of police brutality. Roughly two-thirds of blacks
and Latinos said police brutality was either fairly or very common, while
only 28% of whites thought so.</TE>
<TE>   As for the King beating's long-term impact on the LAPD, nearly half
(45%) of Angelenos felt the department had become a better institution
because of it, while 11% felt it had made the department worse and 33%
said it had no impact. That is very similar to findings of a Times poll
taken in spring 1997, the fifth anniversary of the riots.</TE>
<TE>   If Angelenos have mixed feelings about their Police Department, their
views of their own communities and circumstances are more positive than
at any time since the riots--84% said they were at least somewhat
satisfied with their communities. Shortly after the riots, 59% said they
were satisfied and, five years later, 73%.</TE>
<TE>Jobs Are Still a Concern</TE>
<TE>   Jobs and the economy continue to be a concern for nearly half of
Angelenos, however: 49% said the availability of jobs and economic
opportunities in their communities was not good, while 43% thought it
was. But views varied widely among racial groups--nearly two-thirds of
blacks and Latinos rated economic opportunities poor while only one-third
of whites did so.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just very difficult to get a job," said Gloria Atkins, 66, who
lives in the city's harbor area. "There needs to be more training and
more facilities for people to get the training for these jobs."</TE>
<TE>   Atkins said she learned firsthand about job scarcity when she was laid
off more than a year ago as a manager for a high-tech firm and could not
find another job. She reluctantly went to work for her brother's firm.</TE>
<TE>   Residents continue to put crime near the top of their list of problems
facing the city--33% said it was the most important and 17% said gangs</TE>
<TE>were; traffic and education were the No. 1 concerns for 15% and 14%,
respectively, of those interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   The poll of 1,163 Los Angeles city residents was conducted April 18
through 22, and has a margin of sampling error of three percentage points
in either direction.</TE>

<TE>How the Poll Was Conducted</TE>
<TE>The Times Poll contacted 1,163 adults in the city of Los Angeles
by telephone April 18-22. The main sample was supplemented with
an additional sample of 125 African Americans, increasing that
subgroup to 262, which was then weighted to its proportionate
share in the city. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of
all exchanges in the city. Random-digit dialing techniques were
used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. The
entire sample was weighted slightly to conform with census
figures for sex, race, age, education and area of city. The
margin of sampling error for the city of Los Angeles is plus or
minus 3 percentage points; for African Americans it is 6 points.
For certain subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher.
Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as
question wording and the order in which questions are presented.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Asians were
interviewed as part of the entire sample, but there were not
enough to break out as a separate subgroup.</TE>

<DH></DH>

<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD
</DL>
<LD>His excellency, great uncle to all, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
celebrated turning 65 on Sunday, and his wish seemed to be for the U.S.
to hear loud and clear that his people love him dearly.</LD>
<LD>   Iraqis are edgy, especially since President Bush called their country
part of an "axis of evil." They don't want any more bombing. And they
chose their leader's birthday to pour into the streets--maybe not exactly
spontaneously, but in any case in great volume--to say, in effect, "Back
off."</LD>
<LD>   Of course, it is hard to know in a land like Iraq what is really in
people's hearts. Self-expression is not generally part of the landscape.
But there was 11-year-old Lukman Abid pumping his fist in the air,
marching in a crowd tens of thousands strong while chanting, "With our
soul, with our blood, we sacrifice ourselves for Saddam Hussein."</LD>
<TE>   There was also an entire boys elementary school, the students in neat
red vests and crisp white shirts, marching and shouting: "Bush, Bush,
hear very well! We love our Saddam Hussein!"</TE>
<TE>   True, men in dark green military uniforms--members of Hussein's ruling
Arab Baath Socialist Party, each armed with a Kalashnikov rifle--lined
the parade route, and snipers stared down from rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   But whether the participants marched out of love or devotion,
obligation or fear, the birthday bash Iraq threw for its president--or
its president threw for Iraq--made at least one point very clear: After
launching two disastrous wars, enduring the antipathy of the world and
suffering through 12 years of crushing economic sanctions, Saddam Hussein
still has a firm grip on his people and his country. He may not be
stronger than ever, but he is strong enough.</TE>
<TE>   There was another point being made as well: Iraqis feel that, perhaps
for the first time in years, they have the upper hand in their diplomatic
arm-wrestle with America. They believe that a combination of clever
diplomacy and good luck has made it nearly impossible for the U.S. to
strike them right now, and they plan to keep the pressure on. There is a
sense here that Iraq will very soon move to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
to return, a key demand of the international community and one that would
further undermine any American attack plans, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The regime is doing all it can to exploit the Palestinian crisis,"
said Saad Jawad, a political scientist and author. "They are trying to
make it harder for America to attack. . . . They are trying to be
diplomatic."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has not only held on to power since his military was driven
from Kuwait in 1991--he has grown stronger. Analysts, diplomats and
ordinary citizens here all say the West has helped him hold on, largely
by keeping in place economic sanctions imposed after the invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind the sanctions was to weaken the regime, and for a
time, they did. But these days, when Iraqis can't get medicine, they
don't blame their president. When they have to carry bagfuls of their
devalued currency to pay for a small meal, they don't blame their
president. When their electricity shuts off or sewage runs into their
streets, they don't blame their president.</TE>
<TE>   They blame America.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they forgot who is responsible for all this," said one
European diplomat here, who said the best way to oust Hussein might be to
lift the sanctions. That, he said, would focus the spotlight back on the
leadership and its decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Even me, I started to forget what is the cause, what is the real
problem," said the diplomat, who has been based in Baghdad for several
years. "I had to reorient myself."</TE>
<TE>   Baghdad is a sprawling capital, very flat, very rundown. Sidewalks are
crumbled. In some spots, goats pick through heaps of trash.</TE>
<TE>   But this is not a city in decline. In fact, it feels like one on its
way back up. New luxury cars cruise the streets. Stores are filled with
everything from Gillette razors to Pentium-processor computers. Not
everyone has the money to buy these goods. Most don't. But they take
comfort in the merchandise being there, as another sign that their
country has prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   "We know very well it is the American evil which has been working
against our country," said Whalid Sabir, 29, who runs a small nut shop in
the capital. "The celebration of the birthday of the president is
happiness for everyone. He is a symbol, a brave man who stood up against
the evil will of America and Israel."</TE>
<TE>   That's how most people here talk, as if they were quoting a
poster--which they often are. "We are renewing our absolute loyalty for
President Saddam Hussein," read one hand-lettered sign held high over the
crowd at the birthday parade.</TE>
<TE>   The national celebration, though an annual event, was designed this
year to be one more element in a carefully crafted strategy aimed at
insulating Iraq from the possibility of an American attack--and at
preserving Hussein's hold on power. That is why Iraqi authorities invited
Western journalists to cover the event.</TE>
<TE>   For a long time after the 1991 Persian Gulf War, Hussein in effect
used a rope-a-dope strategy against the U.S. policy of containment, much
as Muhammad Ali let opponents flail away at him. And it was working.
Sanctions started to crumble as countries from Russia to Egypt began
flights into Baghdad and others turned a blind eye and allowed all kinds
of goods to be smuggled from their ports.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the election of Bush and then the Sept. 11 attacks.
Suddenly, there were people in Washington gunning for the Iraqi leader,
along with an American appetite for revenge. As the U.S. fired rhetorical
shots at Iraq, Hussein was determined not to wait for bombs to fall. Not
again.</TE>
<TE>   He went on the diplomatic offensive--an offensive that went into
overdrive after Bush made his "axis of evil" remark this year in his
State of the Union address. Bush was referring to North Korea, Iran and
Iraq. But the way the Iraqis see it, only Baghdad was in imminent danger.
Washington at least had some dialogue with the other two.</TE>
<TE>   So Hussein sent his emissaries around the Arab world. When Vice
President Dick Cheney visited the Middle East to drum up support for
action against Iraq, Hussein's men were not far behind. The culmination
of the Iraqi strongman's diplomatic efforts came at the Arab League
summit in Beirut last month, when Iraq and its Gulf neighbors, Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia, agreed publicly to begin to reconcile.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as people here see it, the country got really lucky. The
Israeli-Palestinian conflict flared with a string of Palestinian suicide
bombings, followed by Israel's military invasion of the West Bank.
Hussein looked to rally the Arab street behind him, and he did it well,
halting oil exports and promising $25,000 to every family that lost a
house in the Palestinian refugee camp of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Those tactics did little to help Palestinians, but they elevated
Hussein in the eyes of angry and dispirited Arabs, frustrated by their
own leaders' reluctance to do anything.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who stands up to America and the West will be championed in
the Arab world," said Saadalla Fathi, a recently retired advisor to the
Oil Ministry. "Whatever is achieved does not matter. Iraq is standing on
principle. Iraq has support in the Arab countries and among a large
majority of the Arabs."</TE>
<TE>   Hussein has also managed to retain control of the true levers of power
in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a regime, its main power. its strength, springs not from what
you see," said Jawad, the political scientist. "The real power comes from
the military, security and the [Baath] party."</TE>
<TE>   In Baghdad on Sunday, 18-wheel trucks loaded with people ferried their
cargoes around the city for the two main marches. On 14th of Ramadan
Street, huge crowds walked past the reviewing stand, most seemingly
unaware that they were stepping on two flags painted on the ground. One
was Israel's, the other the United States'. The marchers were too busy
shouting and waving at the president's proxy on the stage, a member of
the Revolutionary Command Council. Hussein's only appearance of the day
was on television.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here in order to show loyalty to President Saddam Hussein,"
said Nagham Shaker, 24, repeating the same line spoken by others along
the parade route. "No one forced us. We came by our own will."</TE>
<TE>   When they had passed the reviewing stand and were out of sight of the
rifle-wielding party members, many of the marchers drifted off. For them,
the celebrating was over.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lieutenant told John McKillop, "Chief wants to see us."</LD>
<LD>   McKillop was the sergeant of robbery-homicide. He hated "friend of
chief" cases. They never did you any good.</LD>
<LD>   There were three visitors in Chief Russell Siverling's office, led by
a man nervously rubbing his head. The visitors were executives from
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. The nervous one, Dave Nelson, had
taken a call two weeks earlier from a man who identified himself only as
"Grant." The caller said a "lady friend" at the hospital knew a
respiratory therapist who had "helped a patient die fast."</LD>
<TE>   Maybe it was patients. Grant had been sketchy. He refused to name his
lady friend, and he could not identify the killer. He suggested someone
read him a list of the respiratory therapists--perhaps he'd recall the
name. He left a pager number.</TE>
<TE>   A hospital official beeped Grant the next day and read him the ledger
of RTs, all 38 of them. He thought "Efren" sounded familiar.</TE>
<TE>   Under other circumstances, the hospital might have written off the
flaky caller. He admitted that he hoped to make money off his tip, even
though his sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous warned him that "smacks of
blackmail." During other calls, about the only new tidbit he gave them
was his last name, Brossus.</TE>
<TE>   But hospital officials could not dismiss him. The year before, one of
their own employees had alerted a supervisor to a rumor that a
respiratory therapist on the graveyard shift, Efren Saldivar, was
wielding a "magic syringe."</TE>
<TE>   McKillop wanted to ask, "Why didn't you call us then?" Instead he
said, "Here's what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, he was back at his desk, dialing a pager--and it did
not belong to Grant Brossus.</TE>
<TE>   On that afternoon--March 2, 1998--McKillop was about to get an
education in a distinct breed of medical killer. "Angels of Death," they
were called. People often saw them as agents of mercy. But McKillop would
learn that there was nothing heavenly about these quiet executioners or
how they often got away with murder for so long. It would take luck,
nightmares and four years for him to get his "angel."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A PAGER VIBRATED on the hip of Glendale's top detective, Will Currie.
He was on a witness stand. He peeked down and saw that the call was from
his former partner. McKillop was his sergeant now, but he'd have to wait.</TE>
<TE>   They'd always been an odd pairing.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop, 36, carried himself with the swagger of a former basketball
point guard used to controlling the action, or trying to. He wore his
dark hair slicked back and had piercing eyes with an edge of impatience.
Raised by a single mother in Queens, N.Y., he saved his Halloween candy
as a kid so he could sell it. By the time he switched coasts and joined
the Glendale Police Department, he was still an operator. While other
cops scrounged guard jobs on the side, McKillop started his own special
events business, providing security, tents and red carpets for movie
premieres.</TE>
<TE>   Currie, on the other hand, was a sad-eyed man of 40 who spoke
haltingly in an accent that was hard to place. He was from South Africa,
where he had been a ranger at a game reserve, showing tourists lions and
rhinos, until he followed one guest, a long-legged blond, to California.
Their marriage didn't last, but Currie found a career when he bought a
"how-to" book the day before a police civil service exam.</TE>
<TE>   Now his Glendale colleagues marveled at how he used the play-dumb
demeanor of TV's Columbo. Currie once told a Pizza Hut robber it was "too
bad" how those newfangled security cameras could see through a ski mask.
The fellow went for it and said, "OK, I was there. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Currie finished testifying against a Brand Boulevard slasher and
called from the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "Get your ass in here," McKillop said.</TE>
<TE>   Next, they enlisted Investigator Tony Futia, who was 6 foot 3,
bench-pressed 400 pounds and had a night law degree. Futia couldn't
understand why his colleagues seemed so excited. When he ran a background
check on Grant Brossus, he found arrests going back 15 years for
burglary, grand theft and transporting cocaine. The hospital's tipster
had done time at Folsom and Corcoran state prisons.</TE>
<TE>   They tracked him down at his father's house. Brossus did not invite
them in. The whole business about patients being killed had been a
misunderstanding, he said. He'd heard wrong. "No disrespect," he said,
and shut the door.</TE>
<TE>   Next was Brossus' "lady friend," who supposedly knew the killer.
Administrators at Glendale Adventist had guessed she was Ursula Anderson,
who often worked graveyard shifts with Saldivar. Currie and Futia found
her at the hospital, which overlooks the Ventura Freeway at the base of
the Verdugo Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "Grant made it up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A few nights later, they returned to see Bob Baker, the respiratory
therapist who had reported the "magic syringe" rumor to a supervisor a
year before. Baker insisted they meet outside in the dark. He kept
looking side to side. Did he want to talk in the car? No, he said, "I'm a
little claustrophobic."</TE>
<TE>   Baker told them the "magic syringe" gossip was not the only thing that
made him suspicious of Saldivar. He'd once glimpsed vials of morphine and
succinylcholine chloride, a paralyzer, in Saldivar's locker.</TE>
<TE>   Currie felt himself flush. It's true. It all happened.</TE>
<TE>   Then he had second thoughts. Baker seemed so conspiratorial. And what
did policemen know about drugs like that, or respiratory therapy, or
hospitals?</TE>
<TE>   That night, the two detectives also talked to John Bechthold,
technical director of the hospital's respiratory department, to whom
Baker had originally passed along the "magic syringe" rumor. He said
Baker and Saldivar hated each other. Besides, hospital officials had kept
an eye on Saldivar after learning of the rumor and seen "nothing
unusual."</TE>
<TE>   Bechthold told them, "I don't think it's happening."</TE>
<TE>   The cops settled on a theory: This wasn't serial murder, but a love
triangle. Efren, Grant, Ursula. Grant had called the hospital to get rid
of Efren.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's panning out," McKillop said when the chief phoned him for
an update. Siverling was getting calls himself, from Glendale Adventist.
At McKillop's request, the hospital had used a ruse--a schedule
change--to keep Saldivar off the job. But how much longer could they do
that? And the administrators wanted to question him, right away, if the
police didn't.</TE>
<TE>   It was March 11, 1998. McKillop summoned Currie. "You're going to have
to pull in Efren."</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing. How do I pull a guy in?"</TE>
<TE>   "We got to."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AT 3:30 P.M. THAT afternoon, Currie phoned the house in Tujunga where
Saldivar had lived since he was a baby and where his parents, Mexican
immigrants, still kept chickens out back. Efren answered. He wanted to
come in immediately. He'd been "sweating for a whole week" about why the
hospital was keeping him away from work.</TE>
<TE>   "Can you come in at 6?" Currie asked. He didn't want to sound too
eager. And he wanted to find Ervin Youngblood, a polygraph examiner for
the Los Angeles Police Department who moonlighted for Glendale. Sometimes
suspects said things you didn't expect when they saw Erv and his box.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop left about 5 for a hockey game in the Santa Clarita Valley.
That was his new sport, roller hockey. Why miss a game for an interview
that was certain to be a bunch of denials? Besides, Tony Futia would be
there to back up Currie.</TE>
<TE>   Except that he wasn't. Minutes after McKillop left, Futia's wife
called. She needed Tony to baby-sit their 2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't worry," Currie told Futia. He would handle Saldivar himself.</TE>
<TE>   He would explain to the hospital worker why he'd been called in, then
turn him over to Youngblood, who was already setting up in an interview
cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   The desk officer buzzed from downstairs. Currie's visitor had arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Where's that one-way mirror," Saldivar asked when he sat down in the
6-by-8-foot cubicle. He was wearing a blue T-shirt, baggy jeans, shorts
and sneakers. He was 250 pounds but soft, his face round, almost puffy.
He sipped a Mountain Dew.</TE>
<TE>   "You've been watching too much television," Youngblood said. His
machine was on a square faux wood table between them, a tangle of wires
coming out, none hooked up yet.</TE>
<TE>   "Efren, do you understand why you're here today?"</TE>
<TE>   "To clear me up."</TE>
<TE>   "To clear you up about what?"</TE>
<TE>   "What he told me is that a--a anonymous call came in saying that I'm
walking around injecting people for the purpose of killing them. Like an
Angel of Death kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Are you an Angel of Death, Efren?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   "Have you done anything like that?"</TE>
<TE>   "This is my reservation--there's been a lot of times where I've not
actually done it, but kind of assisted in either directly or indirectly.
That's why I know it's gonna say, yeah, that I'm lying."</TE>
<TE>   "The only way you would fail my test tonight is if you deliberately
lie," Youngblood said. "Why don't you tell me about the times that you
help--assisted?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, God. All right. I'll start with the very first time. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Youngblood had told the truth--there was no one-way mirror. There was
a microphone, though. It was hidden in what looked like a thermostat. It
carried every word to a tape recorder in the Bug Room at the far end of
the detective bureau. That's where Currie was sitting, headphones on,
listening to Saldivar talk about 1989, his first year at Glendale
Adventist.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 19 years old. Fresh out of school. . . . At about 11 o'clock,
one of the ICU nurses tells me that there's a patient on life support
that was assigned to me."</TE>
<TE>   The patient had cancer, "spread out to the whole body." The family was
"saying their goodbyes," and the doctors were planning to turn off the
breathing machine. But when he peeked through the curtains, it "was still
on. . . . I see the patient doing, like, you know, mild breathing
motions. . . . And I told the nurse. She goes, 'Oh, we can't have that.'
. . . She says, 'The patient's going to die.'</TE>
<TE>   "I go in there. I get both tubes and I connect them."</TE>
<TE>   Youngblood asked, "What did that do?"</TE>
<TE>   "The patient basically suffocated."</TE>
<TE>   "When was the second time?"</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Saldivar said, "Now, the other times. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Currie had planned his night: He'd be done by 9, pick up a California
roll, feed the dogs, sit in front of the tube, fall asleep. But now he
wondered if he'd be making the sushi run.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was speaking of patients who were "super-elderly" and
suffering, most classified "no code," or DNR, "Do Not Resuscitate." He
had rarely done anything overt, like disconnecting tubes, he said. It was
"more of lack of doing something," not giving oxygen, or administering
inadequate CPR, and it happened both at Glendale Adventist and at
hospitals where he moonlighted.</TE>
<TE>   "About how many occasions can you recall . . . where you just didn't
do anything?" Youngblood asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, geez, in the nine years . . . and it's not just me--the nurses do
it too."</TE>
<TE>   "Um-hum."</TE>
<TE>   "I'd have to say at least 100."</TE>
<TE>   In the Bug Room, Currie wondered: Was this a confession, or was it
less than it seemed? Not "doing something" special to save a dying
patient sounded a lot like the hard decisions doctors make every day.</TE>
<TE>   "OK. When is the last time?"</TE>
<TE>   "Last week."</TE>
<TE>   Youngblood needed to confer with Currie, so he asked Saldivar if he
wanted another soda. When he left, Saldivar muttered to himself, as if
trying to make up his mind. "OK. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Maybe. Yes.
Yes."</TE>
<TE>   After the polygraph examiner returned, Saldivar asked, "What if,
hypothetically . . . what would happen to me if, say, I tried something
in the past and I found that it was such a wrong thing that I never did
it again?"</TE>
<TE>   "What did you hypothetically do?"</TE>
<TE>   "Gave him something--something to paralyze him."</TE>
<TE>   In the Bug Room, Currie tried the wall phone. Dead. He went searching
for a phone to call McKillop at the hockey rink.</TE>
<TE>   Youngblood was asking, "Why is it so hard for you to tell me that?"</TE>
<TE>   " 'Cause I'm scared. . . . 'OK, lock him up,' you know."</TE>
<TE>   "Has anybody kicked the door down?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   ". . . What was the medication that you gave?"</TE>
<TE>   "It was Pavulon. . . . I went in . . . and just shot it in."</TE>
<TE>   "Did you put it through the IV or--"</TE>
<TE>   "Right."</TE>
<TE>   "Was that a male or female patient?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember," Saldivar replied. "It was lights off and quiet."</TE>
<TE>   When Currie walked in, Saldivar seemed to know what was coming. "I got
a lot of things to take care of," he said. "I got to get my money out,
give it to my folks."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's deal with one thing at a time," Currie said. "You have the
right to remain silent. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar didn't. He talked--for two hours more.</TE>
<TE>   He had to spell the drug's name for them. "P-A-V-U-L-O-N." He said he
had come across a single bottle improperly discarded, and later carried
it from room to room, looking at the old people with cancer or liver
failure, feeling guilt at his thoughts but also "anger for why these
patients are kept alive." He said he gave his first lethal injection the
previous August, in 1997, then rushed out of the room, petrified. "About
two hours later, I just walked by the nurses station and saw on the board
that the patient expired. And they were expecting it. They didn't think
anything."</TE>
<TE>   He did it again days later--but that was it, he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes little difference whether you helped out two patients or 20
or 100," Currie said. "Are there more than two?"</TE>
<TE>   "No."</TE>
<TE>   When joking around with other RTs, Saldivar said, "I took credit for a
lot more." He had gotten the idea of helping people die from a TV report
on a hospital killer in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   "Approximately when?" Currie asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Six, seven years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The detective had his opening--Saldivar's suggestion that he waited so
long to start. "I'm gonna have to dig a lot deeper," Currie said.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't the only one," Saldivar said.</TE>
<TE>   Currie and Youngblood were not about to get sidetracked. They could
talk about others later. Youngblood asked, "Is it more than 500?"</TE>
<TE>   "No. No. No. No. No. Less than 50. Like I said, I took a lot of credit
for stuff that I didn't do."</TE>
<TE>   "Even if it is more than 50, be truthful."</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be 40-something. I can't believe it's more than 50."</TE>
<TE>   They were at a number: 40 to 50.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to break here," Saldivar said.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you want to do?" Currie asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Take care of my stuff and turn myself in?"</TE>
<TE>   "We can take care of your stuff, yeah. I've got help on the way."</TE>
<TE>   Futia reached headquarters first. Then McKillop. He knew what to do:
Call the chief. Call the captain. Get the brass in. That night.</TE>
<TE>   Youngblood left without ever hooking up his machine. The questioning
continued. "Did you have anything at your house, any mementos?" Currie
asked. "A diary?'</TE>
<TE>   "No. I try to forget."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar worried about his family. "I'm going to shame them," he said.
Would they get stuck with a towing bill for his '87 Volvo, parked across
the street? He worried about his room. Could he go clean it out? He had
videotapes he didn't want his mom to see.</TE>
<TE>   He worried about himself. "I'm going to be some guy's girlfriend," he
said, thinking ahead to prison. "I just know it."</TE>
<TE>   He wondered if he should have gotten a lawyer. He wondered what his
4-year-old nephew would think. " 'Efren--bad uncle.' Damn it."</TE>
<TE>   Then he said, "I have a strict criteria. Not like those other
ones--those other angels. My criteria was strict. They had to be
unresponsive. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Would he mind talking on videotape?</TE>
<TE>   "I've already said enough," he said. "I think that's enough to lock me
away."</TE>
<TE>   Efren Saldivar, 28, was placed under arrest at 11:25 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   But not for long.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NEXT MORNING, they searched his home. They discovered 101
pornographic videos, but no Pavulon or other killing drugs. Nor were
there any in his hospital locker, though Currie did find the printout of
a lung test. The patient was listed as "SALDIVAR, EFREN HEY YOU." The
doctor was given as "KEVORKIAN, JACK."</TE>
<TE>   It was provocative, but nothing you could hold him on.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Kelberg told them so. Kelberg headed the medico-legal unit of
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. In the O.J. Simpson
trial, he kept the coroner on the stand for eight days. "I am thorough,"
he explained.</TE>
<TE>   He met with the cops March 13 and laid down the law: Just because a
man said he killed someone, or lots of people, didn't make it so. They
needed evidence. They had 48 hours from the time of the arrest to charge
Saldivar or let him go.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Siverling said there had to be "some way" to keep him in jail.
What if he fled to Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   "Have a nice trip," Kelberg replied and waved.</TE>
<TE>   Currie prepared the 849B papers, "Release From Custody."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was confused. He started sobbing as he was given back his
wallet and small black flashlight. "Thank you," he said. "Thank you."</TE>
<TE>   With that, the hard work began.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop assembled a task force with Currie, Futia and four others.
They needed a place close to hospital records and witnesses. So McKillop,
the born operator, went into a meeting with Glendale Adventist officials
and came out with a 1920s house across the street, hidden in a grove of
fruit trees, with a fireplace in the living room and a barbecue terrace.
Others called McKillop's hideaway "Club Adventist" or "Club Med."</TE>
<TE>   That's where he brought in a series of experts to tell them what they
were up against.</TE>
<TE>   An LAPD psychologist produced lists of notorious serial killers,
loaded with medical murderers, from Boston nurse Jane Toppan, who gave at
least 31 patients poison cocktails in the 1800s, to the roving Dr.
Michael Swango, then in the news, who relished the "close smell of indoor
homicide." Another popped up every year, a Genene Jones killing up to 20
infants in Texas with an anticoagulant, or a Donald Harvey, pleading
guilty to 37 patient murders in Ohio and Kentucky, and killing a neighbor
too, with an arsenic-laced pie.</TE>
<TE>   Compassion rarely was a motive. Some killed for money, others to look
like heroes, trying to revive their victims. And their drugs rarely eased
anyone into a merciful death. Take Pavulon. It kept patients from gagging
when doctors inserted breathing tubes down their throats. It temporarily
paralyzed them. Without the breathing tubes, they suffocated--conceivably
while fully aware of their inability to move, breathe, even scream. All
they could do was panic and die.</TE>
<TE>   Another guest at "Club Med" was forensic scientist Henry Lee, the star
defense witness at the Simpson trial. He said this was the easiest kind
of serial killing to get away with. You had to figure out who the victims
were long after they were buried. "You have to dig up [bodies]. You are
going to have a difficult time finding true trace drug or elements in
there. The next issue is how to link to the suspect. Why him? What's the
proof?</TE>
<TE>   "Prepare to fail."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON THE DAY Efren Saldivar was released, he was fired. Then a judge
suspended his state RT's license.</TE>
<TE>   The public still did not know he had confessed to killing up to 50
patients. Glendale Adventist wanted to announce it right away, but
McKillop asked the hospital to hold off so his detectives could work out
of the spotlight. In two weeks the news leaked, and Saldivar recanted.</TE>
<TE>   First, his brother, Eddie, told reporters: "He knows this is going to
blow over. . . . He's not an 'Angel of Death.' He's just an angel."</TE>
<TE>   Then Saldivar himself appeared on two TV magazine shows. On one, the
host said: "If his confession is true, Efren Saldivar has murdered more
people than Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy or John Wayne Gacy."</TE>
<TE>   But Saldivar said it wasn't true, that he had told the police what he
did because "I wanted to die." People were making allegations, he was
depressed, a detective claimed they had him cold. "I started to
embellish. . . . I lied."</TE>
<TE>   Days later, Saldivar phoned Glendale Adventist to apologize about what
he had done to its reputation and to its other RTs. All had been
suspended pending an internal investigation, and four were fired,
apparently for not sharing their suspicions about him. He acknowledged
telling the police that others had killed as well, but now said they
"were clean."</TE>
<TE>   Then he telephoned the task force to complain about Currie. "He's out
to get me." He also wanted his property back, his videotapes. Did they
think the porn would show him having sex with dead patients?</TE>
<TE>   "I had over 100 porno movies, and they had nothing to do with this,"
he griped. "They think I'm a necrophiliac. Do you believe that?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE DETECTIVES BEGAN with a number: 1,050.</TE>
<TE>   That was how many patients had died while Saldivar was on duty, or
within an hour of his shifts, during his nine years at Glendale
Adventist.</TE>
<TE>   The next number was 171. That was how many deaths were left after they
decided to ignore his first seven years--figuring the more recent cases
offered a better chance of finding traces of paralyzing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Then 117. That was how many remained after they eliminated the bodies
that were cremated. If he'd killed those people, he'd gotten away with
it.</TE>
<TE>   That left a daunting challenge: picking which of the 117 to exhume and
test. Doctors had declared that every one of those deaths was due to
natural causes. McKillop and his detectives had to prove the doctors
wrong. Otherwise, no case.</TE>
<TE>   They'd hoped to get help, first from Saldivar himself. But during his
confession, he had recalled no names or specific dates.</TE>
<TE>   His co-workers also were of little help, even after limited grants of
immunity--anything they said couldn't be used against them. Ursula
Anderson was brought back time and again for questioning. She finally
admitted seeing Saldivar in a hospital room with a syringe in his hand,
the plunger back--and "I just hollered . . . 'Efren!' " But she said she
did not know who the patient was, or whether the patient died.</TE>
<TE>   The detectives hoped that some patients' family members might have a
lead. More than 500 called police or hospital hotlines. But most had not
been the least bit suspicious about their loved ones' deaths. Other
callers stunned the cops: people who said that Saldivar had done the old
folks a favor. One doctor said, "Let them rest in peace."</TE>
<TE>   There were no shortcuts. The cops and medical consultants had to sift
through more than 100,000 pages of records. It took them until March 12,
1999, one year and a day after Saldivar confessed.</TE>
<TE>   The new number was 20. That was how many bodies the higher-ups decided
were realistic to exhume.</TE>
<TE>   It was guesswork of sorts. The death of Salbi Asatryan, 75, had
inspired the "magic syringe" talk. A nurse recalled seeing Saldivar with
Luina Schidlowski, 87, minutes before she died. And Eleanora Schlegel,
77, had fed herself the night before and was talking of going home after
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   They and 17 others would be dug up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   EXHUMATION DAYS BEGAN at 6 a.m. Groundskeepers erected tents for
privacy at that day's cemetery and a lab worker took soil samples, in
case a defense attorney tried to argue that chemicals found in the bodies
had seeped in. By 7:45, a van was taking the casket to the coroner's
office. Currie discovered rosemary by the entrance, and the detectives
stuffed handfuls into their masks to counteract the stench inside.</TE>
<TE>   There was a checklist of tissues to be removed: liver, bladder, thigh
muscle, etc. Wearing smocks, booties and gloves, the detectives carried
jars containing pieces of heart or brain. By 11:30 a.m., the bodies had
been sewn up and put back into the caskets for reburial.</TE>
<TE>   They began in April and examined the first four bodies in six days,
then exhumed one a week through the summer of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop and Currie personally took the first batch of samples to the
lab--and not a local police lab, whose work defense lawyers would love to
pick apart. For this case, they would make the 334-mile drive to Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory outside Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   A highway patrolman spotted their unmarked car going 100 mph up
Interstate 5. McKillop flashed his lights over the back seat, but the
officer pulled them over anyway.</TE>
<TE>   He walked to the passenger window, so Currie did some fast talking.
"We got frozen body parts in the trunk. We've got to get them to the lab
before they melt."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, really?"</TE>
<TE>   Not really. The tissue had been preserved in jars and boxed. But who
would check to see if pieces of a lung were frozen?</TE>
<TE>   "You got any ID?"</TE>
<TE>   Currie flashed his badge. The fellow thought about it.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, then. See you later."</TE>
<TE>   On every trip after that, they kept a dummy box on the back seat. It
was empty, but if another cop stopped them for speeding, he'd see the big
sticker: "CAUTION BIOHAZARD."</TE>
<TE>   It could be a lark, an investigation like this. Except for the
nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   In McKillop's, he was in a morgue, and bodies were moving, getting up
off their gurneys. Or one of his four sons was on a gurney, and McKillop
was trying to stop the autopsy, but couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   And that was not the only way he felt powerless.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BRIAN ANDRESEN GAVE them the bad news upfront. The head of forensic
science at Livermore did not think he could find even a trace of one of
the drugs Saldivar may have used. Succinylcholine chloride--the drug
glimpsed in his locker--broke down too quickly. If he killed with
"Succs," investigators were sunk.</TE>
<TE>   Andresen felt confident testing only for Pavulon, which left a
distinct chemical fingerprint and had been detected in some cases years
after burial.</TE>
<TE>   But after six weeks of preliminary testing, there was no evidence of
that drug either.</TE>
<TE>   Then, finally, the "first unusual finding." The catch was that it was
on tissue from Balbino Castro, 87, who had gotten Pavulon nine days
before he died as part of his regular medical care. Any defense attorney
might argue that this was why traces were in his system.</TE>
<TE>   The brass began thinking of pulling the plug on the investigation,
maybe if there were no clean "hits" after 10 exhumations. The lab work
alone cost $150,000 to start, and Capt. Jerry Stolze, who supervised all
detective units, had to dismantle his gang squad because of the manpower
drain.</TE>
<TE>   Even if they thought the guy did it, Stolze wondered, "When do I say,
'Enough is enough? We couldn't prove it. It's over.' "</TE>
<TE>   McKillop quickly set up a conference call between Andresen and their
bosses. McKillop asked the lab director, "In your opinion, should we
continue with the testing, or should we cease it?"</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion," Andresen replied, "you should continue."</TE>
<TE>   He revealed why on Aug. 21, when he came down to "Club Med" for a
presentation. Exhumations were not finished, but he had "hits" on three
patients: Castro, Asatryan and Schidlowski. He found Pavulon in their
lungs, kidney, bladder, chest fluid, pericardial fluid, heart tissue,
liver and brain.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks following, he reported three more hits: on Jose Alfaro,
82, a Filipino who had come to the United States to accept citizenship
for soldiers who risked their lives for the Allies; on Eleanora Schlegel;
then on Myrtle Brower, 84, a mentally retarded woman cared for by her
family for decades.</TE>
<TE>   Now the number was six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN HE WAS first set free, Saldivar dyed his hair red and hid out for
a while in the Woodland Hills apartment of some fellow respiratory
therapists. But then he got on with his life. He went to work for Budget
Rent a Car, cleaning and gassing cars. Evenings, he delivered pizza.</TE>
<TE>   He held the Budget job for eight months, into the spring of 1999. Then
he signed on as a customer service agent with TeleChat, a telephone
dating service in Spanish and English. Customers could post voice-mail
ads seeking "long-term relationships," "casual dating," etc. Saldivar
chose the night shift, 6 p.m. until 2 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Co-workers loved him. If their computers weren't working, he fixed
them. When pregnant Carmen Lozano needed a ride home, he waited two hours
until she got off. When Lizbeth Bolanus won a TV as a bonus, he carted it
to her house.</TE>
<TE>   He asked Lizbeth to the movies. They shared their hopes, and she
mentioned having children.</TE>
<TE>   He did not want any, she recalled him saying. "He said, 'What if my
sons are born, and what if something happens to me? What if I'm not all
great as a father? . . . What if my children become criminals?' "</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'You haven't killed anyone.' . . .</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I don't want to bring them into the world.' "</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar passed his 30th birthday at TeleChat and stayed through the
end of 1999. Then he told his boss that he had omitted a detail about his
past when applying for the job. A few civil suits had been filed by
families of former patients at Glendale Adventist, and the name and photo
of the suspected "Angel of Death" might surface again. "That was me," he
said. "Now I'm going to leave."</TE>
<TE>   The employees took a vote. They would take him back, if ever that were
possible. A weeping Carmen Lozano phoned to tell him. "Efren, we miss
you," she said. She assured him that he was still invited to her child's
baptism in the spring of 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The remarkable thing was, he would be free to make it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KELBERG WANTED THE cops to do a few more things.</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor tried to imagine how a defense attorney would attack
their evidence. Those "hits," for instance: They already knew that one
patient, Castro, had gotten Pavulon legitimately at Glendale Adventist.
What if some of the other five had received the drug sometime in the
past? Could that be why it was in their bodies?</TE>
<TE>   Before long, the cops were chasing down years of medical files, going
back to 1978 in one case.</TE>
<TE>   To McKillop, it was like investigating a drunk driver and being asked
to document every drink the man had had in his life. But he had faith in
Kelberg, the purest soul he had ever met in law enforcement. Kelberg kept
saying their job was not to win but to "find the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Soon the Livermore lab was injecting Pavulon into pig tissue to
determine how long it remained detectable.</TE>
<TE>   By the summer of 2000, the delays were driving Capt. Stolze nuts. It
was two years-plus since the confession. Saldivar was still on the loose,
the police budget was paying for pig studies, and McKillop and his boys
were barbecuing rib-eye steaks on the patio at "Club Med."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his detectives thought of Kelberg, Stolze was becoming fed up
with their prosecutor's "thorough" approach. He very quietly sought the
opinion of another. Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie had helped Glendale
win a murder conviction in an earlier medical case. His take on Saldivar:
The man should be in prison. Today.</TE>
<TE>   But MacKenzie was on the outs in the district attorney's office. He
thought it had become way too cautious after its Simpson case fiasco. He
was backing challenger Steve Cooley against incumbent Gil Garcetti in
November. If MacKenzie's guy won, and they still hadn't arrested their
"angel," Stolze knew where to find him.</TE>
<TE>   That summer, McKillop began dreading trips to headquarters. It wasn't
only Stolze asking, "When? When? When?" Other guys would spot him and
say, "You still work here?" "Let's see your ID." "You still riding that
gravy train?"</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, Glendale Adventist officials would drop by "Club Med."
One time, McKillop thought they were suggesting that the public might not
be so outraged if Saldivar's victims were old and arguably on their
deathbeds.</TE>
<TE>   That's when McKillop blew up.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't convinced that all of Saldivar's targets were so sick. One
woman he was suspected of injecting, Jean Coyle, had survived and was
still alive three years later.</TE>
<TE>   And so what if some victims had been failing? "There are two stages of
life when you're the most vulnerable--when you're an infant, and when
you're elderly in the hospital," McKillop said. "In both, you're totally
dependent on other people to take care of you. Are we going to trivialize
their lives?"</TE>
<TE>   By summer's end, Kelberg had another request. He wanted the charts of
every patient in the hospital at the times their six had died. What if
the defense found a chart showing Saldivar was treating someone at the
far side of the hospital when he was supposedly killing elsewhere?</TE>
<TE>   But every patient? Did he know how long that would take?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SALDIVAR SPENT THAT summer of 2000 working as an electrician's
apprentice.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, his bosses trusted him. They gave him keys and the job of
opening up a San Fernando Valley work site where Electra-Cal Contractors
was helping to build an assisted-living condominium complex. He also
found a protector, Edward Journet, 53, a journeyman electrician from
Cajun country.</TE>
<TE>   The hard hats might get on Saldivar because he was fat and hardly
macho, but nobody picked on Journet. By his own account, he had spent 17
years on heroin and two years in prison, and had gone through four
marriages. He was amazed by the apprentice's expensive new tools.
Saldivar had more of them than most old pros. He was buying tools as if
he were sure he'd be working as an electrician for 20 more years.</TE>
<TE>   The two men grew closer as Saldivar went to Journet's home to install
a new hard drive in his computer and play with Taco, his pet Chihuahua.
When Saldivar confided who he was, Journet told him he had been stupid to
confess if he didn't do it.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar wasn't worried. "They don't have any evidence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't pay much attention in November 2000 when Steve Cooley was
elected district attorney. How could he know what that might mean for
him?</TE>
<TE>   "What case?" Saldivar said dismissively when asked if his was still
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Near Christmas, he and his new friend took a trip to Tijuana to pick
up some cheap medicine. Journet remembered Saldivar explaining, "You mix
this and this together, you gonna get this kind of reaction."</TE>
<TE>   The trip was largely to boost Journet's spirits. He had grown almost
suicidal over a breakup with his girlfriend. "I told him, 'I don't feel
like I can go on.' "</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar reacted casually.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't try to talk me out of it or anything," Journet recalled.
"He said, 'I'll help you.' "</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ON JAN. 9, 2001, Saldivar was up two hours before sunrise. The cops
had risen earlier. They assembled at "Club Med" at 3 a.m. The brass all
wanted in on the action, to be part of the caravan. Chief Siverling
brought his camera. Their new prosecutor, Al MacKenzie, was a phone call
away.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop and Currie would stay behind and put on their suits. That's
what you wore when you interrogated a suspect under arrest.</TE>
<TE>   For three years, it had been a case of the night. That was when the
victims died. That was when Saldivar first confessed. That was when
McKillop dreamed of bodies coming alive.</TE>
<TE>   Now, before sunup, Saldivar made a quick breakfast: oatmeal and
coffee. The construction site was 13 miles away, and he had to be out the
door by 5:30 so he could open up.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he reached the 118 Freeway, then eased onto the Balboa
Boulevard exit, a procession of unmarked cars was behind him.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop and Currie got the news at 5:45 a.m. They took their time
going to headquarters. They wanted Saldivar to undergo the full ritual:
the drive in, hands cuffed behind him, the fingerprinting at the jail,
the change into a blue paper jumpsuit. This wasn't like the last time,
when he strolled in on his own.</TE>
<TE>   At 6:42 a.m., Tony Futia led the suspect through the heavy brown door
of another windowless cubicle.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very cooperative," Saldivar said. "I may be a big guy, but . . .
hey, I'm a pushover."</TE>
<TE>   "You gotta get to the gym," Futia said.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim's Burgers, I think," Saldivar quipped.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop stuck his head in and said, "Remember me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yep."</TE>
<TE>   Currie was grim-faced.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Efren."</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, smiley."</TE>
<TE>   Currie said, "Let me take your handcuffs off."</TE>
<TE>   "You know how it works," McKillop said. "You have the right to remain
silent."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar asked, "Well, are we talking in private?"</TE>
<TE>   The last time, there had been a mike in the thermostat. This time
there was a camera hidden in a bookcase, in a three-ring binder. The two
cops ignored the question.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no point in jacking us around," Currie said. "Obviously, if
we didn't have positive hits, you wouldn't be sitting here."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar asked, "How many counts?"</TE>
<TE>   McKillop said, "How many do you think we have?"</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have any."</TE>
<TE>   "You're only kidding, right?" Currie asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   Currie took offense at Saldivar's public statements about the first
confession being "false, coerced."</TE>
<TE>   "What I said to you in here and what I said out there are two
different things," Saldivar replied. "Go by what's in here. Everything
out there was BS. That was for public relations--"</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I understand."</TE>
<TE>   "--to keep the hospital in a good position, for public morale."</TE>
<TE>   McKillop asked, "Why aren't you concerned about yourself? You're
worried about the hospital looking bad, but you're not looking too good."</TE>
<TE>   "You don't understand self-destructive people."</TE>
<TE>   McKillop said, "So we've established the ground--the deal here. We
know people were injected with drugs that they weren't supposed to get. .
. . What's your feeling? You know. Why? Are you sorry?"</TE>
<TE>   It was out of the textbook--inviting the suspect to explain the "why,"
while hoping he might, in the process, admit serial murder.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar said, "So can I get my lawyer? He wanted to be here."</TE>
<TE>   "These are your decisions to make," McKillop said.</TE>
<TE>   The cops were walking in a legal minefield. The U.S. Supreme Court has
ruled that when a suspect invokes his right to remain silent,
"questioning must stop."</TE>
<TE>   McKillop gave Saldivar incentive to continue. He asked, "Do you want
to ask the next question?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sure. . . . What's the number?"</TE>
<TE>   Instead of answering, McKillop pulled out charts from the tests for
Pavulon. "Every one of those indicates a positive, OK, for the drugs.
It's just inundated throughout the body."</TE>
<TE>   "Let's go back to '97," Currie said.</TE>
<TE>   "OK."</TE>
<TE>   "How many people do you think you personally--for lack of a better
term--killed?"</TE>
<TE>   "In '97, seriously slowed down," Saldivar said. " '97 was like a new
leaf."</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar was starting down a path of no return. He said, "The
motivation is so flippant. I'm--I'm shameful to even say. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   "How flippant can it be, Efren?"</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, God, you can't believe how flippant. It was not for personal
pleasure. It was not a rush. It was not--it wasn't any of your typical
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, what was it?" McKillop asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Can we barter?"</TE>
<TE>   "Like what? You want me to wash your car for you?"</TE>
<TE>   "No. I want--I want to make my phone calls."</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely."</TE>
<TE>   " 'Cause I want to call work. . . . People are out there standing.
'Where's Efren?' I've never missed a day."</TE>
<TE>   "I understand."</TE>
<TE>   "Now, as for my lawyer, it's not that I want him in here to stop you
guys, but I want him to know that I'm in here."</TE>
<TE>   "Is that what you were bartering with?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   They led him to a room with a phone, then stayed by the door, out of
earshot. If he reached his lawyer, the message would be "Stop! NOW!" But
it was early, when most people, lawyers included, were still at home,
having their coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere at headquarters, other detectives were also on the phone,
calling the 20 families that had been living with uncertainty since their
loved ones' bodies were exhumed. The cops wanted to notify them of
Saldivar's arrest before it hit the news.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanora Schlegel's son, Larry, was in Chicago on a consulting job for
the federal government. He had been with his mother two nights before her
death, offering a New Year's Eve toast: "Hopefully, next year will be
better." Now, his cell phone rang. Investigator Dan Hinojosa told him
that Saldivar was being charged with six counts of murder. Hinojosa
wanted to wait and tell him the rest in person.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Just tell me," recalled Schlegel. "He said that my mom was
one of the six. Then I went back to the meeting."</TE>
<TE>   In Glendale, when Saldivar was brought back to the cubicle, he was in
a joking mood. He said into the thermostat, "Testing, testing."</TE>
<TE>   He had not reached his lawyer. He was ready to talk about motive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not ethical or humane," he said. "I--I, in addition to others .
. . had the role--responsibility--of staffing. We had too much work. We
can't find nobody to come in."</TE>
<TE>   "Just basically workload, too much work," McKillop said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not something that gave me joy," Saldivar said. "Only when I
was only at my wits' end on the staffing, I'd look on the board. 'Who do
we gotta get rid of?' "</TE>
<TE>   It reminded McKillop how people clung to the belief that these
"angels" killed to relieve suffering. A VA nurse in Massachusetts had
just been convicted of murdering a patient so she could leave for a date.
Saldivar might have talked of compassion in his first confession, but now
it was about trimming his workload.</TE>
<TE>   "What do you think was your highest year?" McKillop asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't just at Glendale."</TE>
<TE>   "What were the other hospitals?"</TE>
<TE>   "Arcadia Methodist. Glendale Memorial."</TE>
<TE>   In the first confession, he had spoken of letting patients die at
other hospitals by not doing all he could to save them, "passive stuff."
Now he was talking about killing with injections.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe two or three" at Arcadia Methodist, he said, where he
moonlighted near the start of his career. "It has to be less than five."</TE>
<TE>   He moonlighted at Glendale Memorial for three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Over at Memorial, maybe 10."</TE>
<TE>   McKillop asked for the "total in all the hospitals."</TE>
<TE>   "I lost count after 60," Saldivar said. "And that was back in '94."</TE>
<TE>   For so long, they had lived with the 40-some estimate in his earlier
confession. Now he was saying the total was higher, much higher.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's over a hundred," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Currie wanted to get more specific. How many more patients had he
injected after he stopped counting at 60? Currie asked Saldivar to think
backward from 1997, the year he had slowed down. "What about '96?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it was 20, 30 or 40."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, how about in '95?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah. '95, same thing--30, 40."</TE>
<TE>   " '94?"</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar took off on a tangent. "It was a gradual thing. . . . I did
it without thinking. I don't know if you ever shoplifted a piece of gum
or something. You don't plan it. After that moment, you don't think about
it for the rest of the day, or ever."</TE>
<TE>   They had spent months analyzing the records of patients who died
during one of his nine years, 1997, groping to pick names off a big board
in "Club Med," deciding which to exhume. Now McKillop believed there
might have been an easier way.</TE>
<TE>   "If we went into '96, '95, '94," he said, "you could have thrown a
dart."</TE>
<TE>   "Uh-huh," Saldivar said.</TE>
<TE>   The rest was mopping up. Why had he slowed in '97?</TE>
<TE>   In part because he was happy being around Ursula Anderson on those
long night shifts. "I would be with her and I wasn't worried about the
patients."</TE>
<TE>   What about Coyle, the pesky woman who had gone Code Blue but survived?</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, her. Yeah. I did try. . . . I gave her, I think, a half dose. . .
. Something in me just held back."</TE>
<TE>   He now said, yes, two other RTs did it also.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be a lookout. . . . I don't know if they stopped, if they
held back, or if it was a rush for them, or it was an experiment. . . .
You only need to teach a person how to fish once. . . . I didn't have to
hold their hands after that."</TE>
<TE>   McKillop started to tell him, "They said--"</TE>
<TE>   "That they participated?" Saldivar asked.</TE>
<TE>   To the contrary. The others admitted no wrongdoing, and his word alone
would not get anyone prosecuted. All still held their licenses.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar too might still be a respiratory therapist somewhere had he
kept his mouth shut.</TE>
<TE>   After 2 1/2 hours, other detectives got their turns with him, bringing
in charts from the cases they investigated. He could recall none of their
dead. "It is a blur," he said. "Because I knew that it would haunt me. .
. . I made a conscious effort not to remember. . . . I'm not denying
anything."</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to make sure they still had his tools, especially his
cordless circular saw.</TE>
<TE>   Futia asked him, "You done with your Coke there?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes."</TE>
<TE>   "Come on, Efren."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY WOULD NEVER know for sure why he did it. The last motive he
offered--killing to ease his workload--appealed to their practiced
cynicism as cops. But it was hard to ignore what he'd said years earlier,
when he suggested that killing was his secret revenge on a world that saw
him, all his life, as a "goody-goody." No one would call him that
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop figured they'd at least get to find out how many people their
"angel" had killed. Saldivar's own account placed him near the top of any
list of serial killers. McKillop was sure the brass would let the task
force keep digging up bodies. His detectives had only checked the year
Saldivar called his slowest, after all. They would have to go back to
deaths in '96, then '95, and keep on going until they couldn't find
Pavulon in any bodies. How else would they learn the truth?</TE>
<TE>   How could he have been so wrong?</TE>
<TE>   At news conferences after the arrest, Cooley and Chief Siverling said
they saw no need for more exhumations, or for any investigation of
earlier deaths, whether at Glendale Adventist or other hospitals. With
the six "hits," they had enough evidence to put Saldivar away for life,
if not get him executed.</TE>
<TE>   There was no public outcry, no great demand to learn how many more
lives he had taken.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't even a flood of lawsuits. Just a dozen or so. Glendale
Adventist had begun offering settlements even before the arrest and a few
families accepted, one getting $60,000. Others waited to see what the
task force came up with, and were out of luck. A judge said they'd waited
too long, past the statute of limitations. Business was up at Glendale
Adventist--the hospital was filling more beds than it had before the
world ever heard of Efren Saldivar.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, McKillop's men were sent back to routine assignments. They
had a barbecue at "Club Med" when Futia returned to robbery-homicide.
Currie began bringing in his sheep dog for company while he assembled the
files for trial. Soon even he began helping out at headquarters, called
in when robbers got $400 from a Taco Bell. Currie didn't object--he
welcomed a case where there was no doubt a crime had been committed and
where you got the bad guys in two days.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop's old job was taken. There was talk of him filling an opening
in the substation at the Glendale Galleria. He might have become sergeant
of the shopping mall had rain not intervened. It seeped into the basement
of "Club Med," soaking boxes of records. As McKillop helped carry them
upstairs, he yelped, "My back!"</TE>
<TE>   It was crazy--jock around all your life, then hurt your back pushing
paper. Disability retirement wasn't a bad deal for a 40-year-old, though.
Half pay for life, tax free. Maybe "friend of chief" cases weren't all
bad.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop was at home when Saldivar, now 32, pleaded guilty last month,
four years and a day after his first confession. The cops had been
expecting him to contest everything: the validity of the confessions, the
lab tests, the circumstantial evidence linking him to the six patients.
But he didn't, deciding that the best he could do was save his own life.
Though he would never get out of prison, the plea bargain spared him
execution with the same drug he had used to kill others.</TE>
<TE>   McKillop bounced from room to room, watching the news on four TVs. He
couldn't help but notice how Saldivar's plea drew less attention than the
dog-mauling murder trial at the same L.A. courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   He wondered whether it was because the public did not know, even then,
of the chilling second confession, in which Saldivar gave his 100-plus
body count and compared killing to shoplifting gum. It had been sealed by
a judge on grounds that it might prejudice jurors, and was not unsealed
until this month, when the case was over.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it was because people didn't want to think of themselves in
the position of Saldivar's victims, old and ailing and alone in a
hospital bed. It was much easier to trust the strangers who roamed the
floors than to think that you might be at their mercy, especially at
night.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe it was because Saldivar gave up so quietly. He bowed his head
at his sentencing two weeks ago and asked forgiveness, "though I don't
expect any," he said. His lawyer said he wished to "make peace with God."</TE>
<TE>   The self-described "Angel of Death" already had made peace with
prison.</TE>
<TE>   Saldivar wrote Ed Journet, his friend from the construction job, that
he was managing well behind bars, though he had one complaint, "the
rats." They came out at night.</TE>
<TE>   But the guards treated him well, and the other inmates did too.</TE>
<TE>   "He's comfortable. It's relaxed," said his brother, Eddie. "When it
comes to the pecking order, he's now reached the top."</TE>

<HD>Deal Struck to End Israel's Siege of Arafat Compound</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The proposal, put forth by the U.S., calls for six men
holed up at the site to serve time in a Palestinian prison. Bush says
Arafat is now 'free to lead.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel and the Palestinians on Sunday accepted a U.S. proposal
aimed at lifting the Israeli army's monthlong siege of Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat inside his West Bank headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, based on a proposal by President Bush, would release Arafat
from weeks spent trapped on two floors of his shattered offices in
Ramallah and defuse one of the most contentious issues dividing the two
sides.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinian officials said they expected the siege to be lifted as
early as today.</LD>
<TE>   At his ranch in Crawford, Texas, Bush praised the Israeli and
Palestinian decisions as "important steps along the path to peace."</TE>
<TE>   However, the president, who was originally reluctant to involve his
administration in the Middle East conflict, said Arafat must act
decisively "in word and in deed against terror directed at Israeli
citizens."</TE>
<TE>   "Chairman Arafat is now free to move around and free to lead," Bush
said. "And we expect him to do so."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the apparent breakthrough, Israeli tanks and troops invaded
the divided West Bank city of Hebron early today. The incursion, which
the army said was limited, was in response to Saturday's attack on the
Jewish settlement of Adora, in which four Israelis were killed and seven
wounded.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian areas of Hebron were under curfew early today as Israeli
troops conducted house-to-house searches for militants and weapons, an
army spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Seven Palestinians were reported killed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal accepted Sunday came amid a flurry of developments,
as the Cabinet of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon also announced that
it would bar a United Nations team from investigating Israel's recent
assault on a West Bank refugee camp. A Cabinet minister said the
government rejected the inquiry because it feared that the U.N. was "out
to get us."</TE>
<TE>   The mission, led by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, also
includes former International Committee of the Red Cross chief Cornelio
Sommaruga and Sadako Ogata, a former head of the U.N. refugee agency.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal, approved overwhelmingly by the Sharon Cabinet,
centers on a group of six men, wanted by Israel, who have been holed up
with Arafat and about 100 others in the besieged headquarters. Under the
terms accepted Sunday, the men would be allowed to serve their sentences
in a Palestinian prison, under the control of American and British
guards.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange, Arafat would be allowed to travel freely in Palestinian
areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and perhaps even abroad, for the
first time since December.</TE>
<TE>   Until the proposal, which Bush made Saturday in telephone calls to
Sharon, Israel had insisted that the Palestinians surrender the wanted
men before it would agree to withdraw the tanks and troops that have
encircled Arafat's offices since March 29. As part of a sweeping West
Bank offensive, Israel had demanded that Arafat act forcefully to rein in
militants who have targeted Israelis this year in a devastating series of
suicide bombings and other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the six men are wanted by the Israelis in connection with the
assassination in October of Rehavam Zeevi, Israel's tourism minister. The
sixth, Arafat aide Fuad Shubaki, is accused of involvement in a large
shipment of arms for the Palestinian Authority, allegedly from Iran, that
was intercepted by Israel on Jan. 3.</TE>
<TE>   Gideon Meir, deputy director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry,
said Israel had not given up on its demand that the men be extradited but
had accepted U.S. and British assurances that they would remain in
prison, albeit in Palestinian territory.</TE>
<TE>   "In every agreement, there is compromise," Meir said. "At this point,
this seemed like the right one to make."</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said Sharon, who spoke with Bush several times
Saturday and at least twice more Sunday, had accepted an invitation from
the president to visit Washington next week.</TE>
<TE>   After Sharon's Cabinet voted Sunday afternoon to accept the plan, the
proposal was conveyed to Arafat in Ramallah by U.S. and British consular
officials. A few hours later, Palestinian representatives announced that
Arafat also had agreed to it.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Cabinet minister Saeb Erekat said U.S. and British
security experts were expected to arrive in the region today to settle
the "technical details" of the transfer of the six men. When those are
resolved, he said, the siege will be lifted, perhaps late today or
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet voted to prevent the U.N. team
from investigating allegations surrounding actions by the Israeli army
during its recent eight-day occupation of the Jenin refugee camp in the
West Bank. Palestinians have accused the army of killing hundreds of
civilians during the assault on the camp, a militant stronghold that was
the scene of the most bitter fighting of the Israeli offensive.</TE>
<TE>   Israel originally agreed to cooperate with the U.N. effort, but in the
last week it has expressed increasing objections about the composition of
the team and the scope of its mission. It has sought several delays in
the team's arrival and sent representatives to New York to clarify the
investigators' mandate and try to add military and counter-terrorism
experts to their number.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, after seven hours of Cabinet discussion, Israeli
Communications Minister Reuven Rivlin told reporters that the U.N. had
reneged on commitments made to Israel about the inquiry, making injustice
in its conclusions almost inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   "This awful United Nations committee is out to get us and is likely to
smear Israel," Rivlin said. "No country in the world would agree to such
a thing."</TE>
<TE>   Meir, the Foreign Ministry official, said that although Israel was
continuing to negotiate with the U.N. over the mission, conditions for
the team's arrival were not yet "ripe." When they are, he said, the
government will cooperate fully.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians have objected to Israel's postponements of the mission
and did so again Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking the secretary-general to send the team and let Sharon
turn them back from the airport if he wants to do that," Erekat said.
"Let the world see what they are trying to hide."</TE>
<TE>   Also Sunday, negotiators made no progress on efforts to end the
26-day-old standoff at the Church of the Nativity in the West Bank city
of Bethlehem, traditionally held to be the site of Jesus' birth.</TE>
<TE>   About 200 Palestinians and 40 clerics, their supplies of food and
water limited, have remained trapped inside the 4th century basilica
since the beginning of the Israeli incursion into Bethlehem on April 2.</TE>
<TE>   Israel now believes that at least 10 wanted men are holed up with the
Palestinians, and it has demanded their exile or trial. The Palestinians
have proposed sending the men to Gaza for trial by Palestinian
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Palestinian negotiators asked to talk with the men inside
and bring them food, saying permission for them to do so would be a
good-faith gesture by Israel. Israeli military officials said that they
were considering the request and that negotiations would continue.</TE>
<TE>   The military "is taking every possible measure to ensure that both the
hostages and the terrorists are released in a quick and safe manner,"
said Capt. Sharon Feingold, an Israeli army spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   But previously upbeat negotiators on the Palestinian side were more
reserved Sunday, predicting up to a week more of talks. Bethlehem Mayor
Hanna Nasser said there had been "no advancement" since face-to-face
talks began April 23.</TE>
<TE>   A key sticking point emerged on how the Israelis would deal with the
Palestinians in the church who are not on the wanted list.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser said the Israeli government was insisting that each Palestinian
in the church undergo interrogation. But the Palestinians are afraid that
could result in additional expulsions or prison terms beyond the 10
wanted men.</TE>
<TE>   "The Israelis are adamant that they interrogate each" man, Nasser
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military declined to discuss negotiation details.</TE>
<TE>   Nasser also said he had spoken to Arafat about the possibility of
arranging a deal similar to the one the Israeli Cabinet endorsed to end
the siege of the Palestinian leader's compound in Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Under that scenario, U.S. or U.N. troops would oversee the transfer of
the wanted men to Gaza for trial.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nasser, Arafat said, "Let's keep in touch and see what
happens."</TE>

<HD>Discord Is Drumbeat at Afghan Parade</HD>
<DH>Asia: Event marking victory over the Soviets exposes national
divisions ahead of a meeting to select a new government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>The tanks were squeaky and spewed clouds of smoke. The soldiers
marched out of step. Some of the trucks had bullet holes in their
windows. The helicopters, though freshly painted, were mostly antiques.
And one MIG warplane had crashed the day before, killing the pilot.</LD>
<LD>   But despite the flaws, a military parade Sunday here in the Afghan
capital conveyed a strong message about the power of Northern Alliance
figures in the interim government.</LD>
<LD>   It also exposed the divisions in Afghan society in the run-up to a
grand council meeting in June to choose a new government, and the likely
reluctance of the Northern Alliance leaders--such as Defense Minister
Mohammed Qassim Fahim, just promoted to the rank of marshal--to surrender
the powerful posts they have in the interim administration.</LD>
<TE>   The recently returned Afghan king, Mohammad Zaher Shah, popular among
ordinary people and particularly the Pushtuns--the country's largest
ethnic group--was not present, suggesting that he either is irrelevant to
Afghan politics or has been shut out by the ethnic-Tajik-dominated
Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The military units marching at the head of the parade were from
Northern Alliance strongholds, with no units from cities such as Kandahar
or Herat, illustrating the distance Afghanistan has to cover before it
can hope to establish a united national army.</TE>
<TE>   The event seemed sure to reinforce doubts among ethnic Pushtuns in
Afghanistan about the degree of power held by the Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The parade, held annually, celebrates the defeat of the country's
Soviet occupiers by moujahedeen fighters in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses to last year's version, under the now-deposed Taliban
regime, said there were fewer tanks then and no military uniforms. The
parade consisted mainly of Taliban fighters in their favorite military
vehicles: pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sunday's parade, new boots were issued to the soldiers, who
marched along with portraits of Hamid Karzai, the interim prime minister.</TE>
<TE>   The parade also further entrenched the cult of assassinated Northern
Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Masoud. A giant portrait of him was carried at
the front, and tanks bore his picture along with colorful paper flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Just behind Masoud's portrait came veteran fighters in wheelchairs and
on crutches, a sight that seemed to underscore the irony of organizing
the gigantic military parade. Though the parade was a celebration of the
withdrawal of the Soviet forces, that event actually marked the beginning
of more than a decade of bloody civil war, when the moujahedeen who
defeated the Soviets started fighting one another for control of Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's procession lacked the clockwork precision and stirring
military music of a Soviet or Russian military march in Red Square, but
clearly much of the ceremony was borrowed from the Russians.</TE>
<TE>   Afghan television broadcast the event--and Karzai's participation--at
length Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   One Kabul resident, Sultan Ali, 45, who watched the coverage, was
confused as to the parade's meaning: He thought it was a "celebration on
the actions of the president," meaning Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of Karzai, there was a celebration today. People wanted to
show their happiness because of his leadership," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The first two military units were from the Panjshir Valley--an area
never captured by the Taliban. They were followed by others from the
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, Jabal os Saraj, Bagram, Kapisa and
elsewhere. All are Northern Alliance strongholds.</TE>
<TE>   There was one group from Khowst in eastern Afghanistan, but its
members were traditional dancers, not warriors. Toward the end, there
were firefighters and airport security guards.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the soldiers who marched waved flowers as they passed Karzai
or had blossoms affixed to their guns.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech launching the parade, interim Defense Minister Fahim spoke
at length about how Afghans are so strong and brave that they could
defeat any invader.</TE>
<TE>   He did not mention the U.S. help Afghanistan received to defeat the
Soviets in the 1980s, during the Cold War, or in the recent fight against
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "Again these moujahedeen beat Al Qaeda and the Taliban too. All the
countries of the world forgot us. We beat them," Fahim said.</TE>
<TE>   He promised that there would be no more war and pledged to build a
national army.</TE>
<TE>   One Kabul resident, Abdul Ghafar, 35, said that even though the
military hardware on show was rather old, it still sent a signal to
Afghanistan's neighbors not to interfere in the country's affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a sign to them that we are strong and we can defend ourselves,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Reunions Kindle Hope for More Dialogue</HD>
<DH>Asia: Koreans bridge the divide of time and borders. The rush of
emotions is televised.</DH>

<LD>As TV cameras zoomed in to catch their every word, elderly Koreans
traded half a century's worth of endearments and recriminations at family
reunions Sunday in the North Korean resort of Mount Kumgang.</LD>
<LD>   "Mother! I can't believe you are alive!" exclaimed a North Korean
woman, Kim Young Hee, as she embraced the 81-year-old parent who she had
thought was killed during the Korean War.</LD>
<LD>   "What happened? Did you run off with your girlfriend?" demanded Jeong
Gwi Yeop, 75, a South Korean woman berating a husband who disappeared in
1951. She was so angry that her wounds seemed as fresh as though they had
been inflicted the day before.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's reunions were the first to take place since February of last
year and a hopeful sign that the two Koreas are restarting their
dialogue. The leaders of the estranged countries pledged at a historic
summit in 2000 to hold regular such reunions, but after three rounds, the
agreement broke down amid bickering over timing and location. The North
Koreans abruptly canceled a fourth round, which had been scheduled for
October, complaining about security measures imposed in South Korea after
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea eventually agreed to allow the weekend reunions to take
place at Mount Kumgang, a tightly controlled tourist enclave, instead of
in the capitals of Seoul and Pyongyang, where the earlier gatherings took
place. For Sunday's event, 99 elderly South Koreans selected by lottery
from thousands of applicants got the opportunity to meet with 184 North
Korean relatives. They will spend three days together, after which 100
North Koreans will have the chance to meet with 474 of their South Korean
relatives, also at Mount Kumgang.</TE>
<TE>   In what has become virtually the Korean version of reality
programming, the reunions were broadcast live on South Korean cable
television--affording the participants little privacy and giving viewers
here a close-up of some wrenching emotional moments.</TE>
<TE>   There was less joy than sorrow, as many relatives told one another
about loved ones who had died. One North Korean woman, Lee Shin Ho, who
had expected to meet her 93-year-old mother, learned instead that she had
died Friday. A son fell to his knees, bowing to a father he had not seen
since he was a baby. Elderly sisters sobbed and embraced as they
recounted the heartbreak of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "When shall we meet again?" asked Ju Oak Hee, 78, reunited with a
sister she hadn't seen in half a century and most likely won't see again
after this week.</TE>
<TE>   North Korean leader Kim Jong Il agreed to resume the reunions during a
summit this month with Lim Dong Won, a special envoy of the South Korean
president. Also at that meeting, a deal was reached to resume work on
road and rail lines between the Koreas, along with other kinds of
economic cooperation. The Communist North, with its failing economy, is
desperate for financial help from the prosperous South, and its latest
concessions are widely viewed as bids for money.</TE>
<TE>   Today, North Korea kicks off a two-month festival known as Arirang,
which features mass gymnastics and parades in honor of the 90th birthday
of the country's late founder, Kim Il Sung.</TE>
<TE>   Although the event was originally planned to bring in revenue from
tourism, North Korea said at the last minute that it would not invite
South Koreans--leaving events such as the highly restricted reunions at
Mount Kumgang the only opportunity for ordinary people from the two
halves of the peninsula to interact.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers believe that the North Korean leadership is worried
that its people might grow unruly if they become aware of the far greater
wealth of South Korea. In the last few days, three North Koreans have
defected to the South through embassies in Beijing--bringing to 162 the
total number of North Korean defectors to arrive here this year.</TE>
<TE>   The North Koreans also used the occasion of the reunions for a little
propaganda pitch. Participants from the North wore Kim Il Sung buttons,
and they took pains to dispel on camera their relatives' worries about
famines and hardships in North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in the embrace of the great leader. I was well cared for
and well educated," a man in his 70s, Lee Kwang Chol, said sternly. His
older sister from South Korea looked on skeptically.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Soldiers Hunt Taliban in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Military: Covert operation expands to northwestern tribal areas on
the border with Afghanistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. ground troops have taken the war against terrorism to unruly
tribal areas in northwestern Pakistan, local residents and government
officials confirmed Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The expanding covert operation is a potential problem for President
Pervez Musharraf, whose opponents in a broad spectrum of political and
religious parties charge that he is surrendering Pakistan's sovereignty
to the U.S. military and CIA operatives.</LD>
<LD>   Twelve to 15 U.S. soldiers joined about 200 soldiers from Pakistan's
Frontier Corps on Friday night in searching an abandoned school for
Jalaluddin Haqqani, the former top commander in Afghanistan's Taliban
regime, local resident Abdul Samaad said by telephone Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Haqqani was among thousands of Taliban troops and officials who fled
Kabul, the Afghan capital, last fall as opposition Northern Alliance
forces advanced to the city's outskirts.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. soldiers were in uniform and carrying weapons and other
equipment, but they did not fire any shots during a four-hour operation
in the North Waziristan tribal agency, Samaad added, quoting the school's
watchman, Mir Akbar.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's government has refused to discuss details of the operation
publicly, just as it did after a joint U.S.-Pakistani mission led to the
arrest last month of Abu Zubeida, a suspected senior lieutenant of Osama
bin Laden's.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Sunday in Karachi, the country's commercial capital,
Musharraf said that the U.S. forces were simply providing communications
support and that they numbered no more than 10.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have been similarly close-mouthed. During a visit
Saturday to Kabul, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld would say only
that the U.S. has been pleased with the cooperation it has had from
Pakistan in the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>U.S. Involvement a Sensitive Issue</TE>
<TE>   The people living in the affected region resent U.S. involvement in
the mission so strongly that they protested by shutting down the local
market for three days, Samaad said.</TE>
<TE>   Maulana Mohammed Din Dar, a local leader of the
Jamiat-ul-Ulema-e-Islam group, issued a statement Friday that offered
cooperation with local forces but not the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Two helicopters brought the U.S. troops to the village of Dandi Durpa
Khel, less than two miles west of the town of Miram Shah, about 6:30 p.m.
Friday, Samaad said. He said they searched an abandoned Koranic school,
or madrasa, founded by Haqqani. One or two of the Americans spoke Pashto,
the dominant language of northwestern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan.
The Pakistani soldiers were members of the Tochi Scouts, a unit of the
Frontier Corps, which is made up of local Pathans and dates to 19th
century British rule.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Pakistani Interior Ministry source confirmed that Friday's
raid had taken place but said no one was arrested and claimed that U.S.
personnel were civilians who were not in uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Samaad said the Americans had left the area, but a man who recently
returned from the area, Mahmood Khattak, said an official had told him
the U.S. forces were continuing their search mission in the agencies of
South and North Waziristan.</TE>
<TE>   Khattak added that he had heard that the forces might be planning a
raid in Angur Hada, a small town in South Waziristan near the
Pakistani-Afghan border.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of U.S. soldiers carrying out covert operations on Pakistani
soil provide ammunition for the political enemies of Musharraf, who hopes
to legitimize his 1999 bloodless coup through a referendum Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are concerned that Gen. Pervez Musharraf has not taken the nation
into confidence on the latest developments taking place," said
Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for former Pakistani Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto.</TE>
<TE>   "The general might be bending over backward in order to secure the
support of the [anti-terrorism] coalition, and international community,
for his unconstitutional acts in Pakistan and suppression of democracy,"
Babar said. Bhutto, who faces corruption charges in Pakistan, is living
in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   For Musharraf, the biggest risk of allowing U.S. troops to operate in
Pakistan is that they might end up in a firefight and injure or kill
Pakistanis. The public outrage would be fierce, Babar said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt about that," he said. "If the foreign troops are seen
patrolling in Pakistani territory, and also start shooting with impunity,
it will create a serious backlash and great resentment."</TE>
<TE>   The search for Haqqani in a barren, mountainous region of Pakistan
near the Afghan border is believed to be linked to the arrest of Abu
Zubeida.</TE>
<TE>   Any attempt to arrest Haqqani is likely to be risky because he is
known as a cunning guerrilla commander who was once a U.S. ally in the
Aghan war against Soviet occupation in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Haqqani was a leader of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami faction,
the top recipient of covert aid from the U.S. during the war against the
Soviets. Hekmatyar, now closely allied with Iran, is reportedly back in
Afghanistan and has been accused of plotting to overthrow the pro-Western
interim government headed by Hamid Karzai.</TE>
<TE>   The tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan are notoriously difficult to
rule, and its people have a long tradition of armed resistance against
outsiders. The Wazir people, who may be sheltering Haqqani and other
suspected Bin Laden supporters, are known as tough and sly fighters,
according to Pakistani military historian Mohammed Nawaz.</TE>
<TE>   "They are armed with age-long savagery and cunning, and aided by
modern rifles," Nawaz wrote in his 1994 book "The Guardians of the
Frontier." "They seldom allow a tactical error to go unpunished.</TE>
<TE>   "History has countless examples with excellent descriptions to
illustrate their exceptional cruelty, murder, lust, double dealing and
other similar traits," Nawaz continued. "On the other hand, many examples
can be found to prove their bravery, ingenuity, hospitality and martial
arts."</TE>
<TE>   The rugged, mountainous terrain is similar to the region across the
border in Afghanistan, where U.S. military leaders fighting the Taliban
and Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network relied on massive airstrikes
by B-52 bombers, which Musharraf could never allow in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "A peculiarity of many Wazir villages is their close proximity to
large caves, to which the tribesmen have access as dwelling places in
winter for the sake of obtaining warmth," Nawaz wrote. "These caves are
also admirable air raid shelters."</TE>
<TE>Commander Is Known as a Vicious Fighter</TE>
<TE>   Haqqani is believed to have survived several U.S. bombing attacks in
Afghanistan and has proved himself an uncanny survivor after more than
two decades as a warrior against first the Soviets, then fellow Afghans
and now Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar made Haqqani, an ethnic Pushtun,
his top commander after Sept. 11, but Haqqani earned a reputation as a
vicious fighter long before that.</TE>
<TE>   He led the Taliban attacks on the plains north of the capital, Kabul,
in 1996 and 1997, during which thousands of people were driven from their
homes and whole villages were burned. On Nov. 12, as the Taliban regime
was crumbling, U.S. bombers and at least one helicopter attacked a home
and guardhouse next to Haqqani's house in Kabul's Wazir Akhbar Khan
neighborhood, a comfortable district in an otherwise ruined city.</TE>
<TE>   A guided missile blasted a four-wheel-drive Toyota pickup, the
Taliban's favorite vehicle, into a twisted and burned wreck in the street
outside Haqqani's walled compound. But the commander escaped.</TE>
<TE>   An unconfirmed report in December said Haqqani had been wounded in a
U.S. bombing raid on Nov. 16 near Khowst, a longtime Al Qaeda stronghold.
Haqqani's bodyguards and several of his relatives were among 62 people
killed in those airstrikes, according to the Afghan Islamic Press, based
in Peshawar, Pakistan.</TE>

<HD>A Venerable Voice in Israel Is Muted After Questioning Army's
Actions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>To generations of Israeli fans, Yaffa Yarkoni has been "the Singer
of the Wars." Whenever troops marched into battle, they could be sure
Yarkoni would follow. Clad in fatigues, she raised spirits at the front
with her rousing renditions of patriotic songs.</LD>
<LD>   So it seemed natural for Army Radio to interview the iconic singer in
her home a few days before Israel's Independence Day this month. Once
again, Israeli troops were at war, this time in the West Bank, where they
were sweeping through Palestinian towns and refugee camps in Israel's
largest military operation there since the 1967 Middle East War.</LD>
<LD>   But this time, Yarkoni offered no words of encouragement. Instead, she
bitterly criticized the troops, the government and Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon in an anguished tirade that shocked her interviewer and enraged
many Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   "When I saw the Palestinians with their hands tied behind their backs,
young men, I said, 'It is like what they did to us in the Holocaust,' "
Yarkoni said. "We are a people who have been through the Holocaust. How
are we capable of doing these things?"</TE>
<TE>   Her words were deemed so offensive that the union representing the
nation's performing artists called off a planned tribute to Yarkoni that
had been in the works for two years. The head of the union said it was
forced to make the move after members of the public flooded its offices
with complaints and returned tickets purchased for the event, and after
sponsors canceled their financial support.</TE>
<TE>   Government ministers denounced Yarkoni. The town of Kfar Yona canceled
her performance at a Memorial Day event to honor Israeli soldiers who
have fallen in battle. Youth movements declared a boycott of her music.
The septuagenarian received so many hate calls, her daughter said, that
she is now too frightened to appear in public.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when many Israelis believe that they are locked in a battle
for their existence with the Palestinians, Yarkoni's remarks, and the
backlash against her, have stirred a debate here about freedom of speech
and the nature of patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened to Yaffa Yarkoni," said Naomi Chazan, a left-wing
member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, "exemplifies the fact that in
the current climate in Israel, anything that is not the official line is
considered treachery or betrayal."</TE>
<TE>   Yarkoni is not the only public figure who has come under attack
recently. Yossi Beilin, the dovish former justice minister, found himself
the target of a boycott effort this month. A group of 43 professors and
instructors at Ben Gurion University in Beersheba signed a letter
protesting Beilin's scheduled appearance to lecture on Jews in the 21st
century.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of being invited to lecture, said Dr. Arieh Zaritsky, a
geneticist who was one of the signatories, the former Cabinet member
should be standing trial in Israel for helping draft the 1993 Oslo peace
accords between Israel and the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he is a criminal," Zaritsky said.</TE>
<TE>   Beilin did deliver his lecture, and a stream of university professors
took to Israeli radio and television talk shows to denounce what they
said was an attempt to stifle academic freedom.</TE>
<TE>   But Zaritsky denies that those who opposed Beilin's appearance are
against free speech.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to save Ben Gurion University from the shameful appearance
of a person who has demonstrated, to say the least, a lack of judgment,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll published Friday, the Israeli daily Maariv found that at a
time of threat, large segments of the Israeli public are more interested
in unity than free speech.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether journalists who criticize the army's current operation
in the West Bank and the government's policies in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip harm national security or strengthen democracy and the country, 58%
of those polled said they harm national security. Asked whether it was
appropriate to cancel the performance honoring Yarkoni after she spoke
against Israel's policies in the territories, 55% said it was.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only Yaffa Yarkoni or Yossi Beilin," wrote Maariv analyst
Hemi Shalev of the poll's results. "Fifty-eight percent of the public, a
stable and definite majority, believes that journalists who criticize
[army] operations or government policy 'harm state security.' No more and
no less, and very, very scary."</TE>
<TE>   It is one thing, Shalev wrote "to believe in the colossal failure of
Oslo or the need to take measures against the Palestinians with a strong
hand and powerful arm, and another thing entirely to accuse anyone who
thinks otherwise of something akin to treason. This is a slippery slope."</TE>
<TE>   Yarkoni declined to be interviewed for this story. Her daughter, Orit
Shohat, said her 77-year-old mother is too distressed to speak. But
Shohat said Yarkoni, who has not previously made political statements,
has no regrets about the comments she made.</TE>
<TE>   "They interviewed her just after she saw the pictures from the Jenin
refugee camp," Shohat said. Her mother was shocked by footage of the
large-scale destruction carried out inside the camp during a battle there
between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen, Shohat said.</TE>
<TE>   "She spoke from the heart. And she says she would say it all again.
But there is a patriotic mood now, and nobody is supposed to say anything
except how well we did in Jenin, how wonderful we are and how we are the
most moral army in the world. If you say something else, you are an
outcast."</TE>
<TE>   Writing in the mass-circulation daily Yediot Aharonot, commentator
Eitan Haber pleaded with his countrymen to come to their senses.</TE>
<TE>   "Yaffa Yarkoni tripped over her tongue," Haber wrote. "She spoke words
of terrible folly . . . but the ganging up on her says more about us than
it does about her. We are a hysterical country. We have lost our brakes
and run off the rails."</TE>
<TE>   Yarkoni served as a radio operator in Israel's War of Independence in
1948 and began her career singing the songs adopted as anthems by the
Palmach, the Jewish underground militia that fought the British and the
Palestinians in the pre-state days. In 1967, after Israel captured
Jerusalem's Old City, it was Yarkoni who sang "Jerusalem of Gold" in
front of the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. And on Israel's 50th
Independence Day, in 1998, she was awarded the prestigious Israel Prize
for her contribution to the nation's music.</TE>
<TE>   But in the Army Radio interview, Yarkoni said this was "the worst Yom
Hatzmaut [Independence Day] I can remember. I have never seen things more
dismal or black. I feel we are at the edge of the abyss."</TE>
<TE>   She still remembers, Yarkoni said, how soldiers would clamor to board
trucks headed for the front in previous wars "because we knew it was a
war of existence. Today, what are we fighting for? Are we fighting for
territories? For what?"</TE>
<TE>   She said she understood the Israeli reserve soldiers who have refused
to serve in the West Bank and Gaza, and revealed that one of her
sons-in-law is among them. If the situation in Israel continues to
deteriorate, she said, she might think of sending her grandchildren
abroad to live.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to put them through what we have been through, what my
children have gone through. These are traumas," she said. "And until
when? How long? What can you explain to them? That these are our enemies?
To create more hate?"</TE>
<TE>   What Yarkoni said was nothing less than "blasphemy," said Reuven
Rivlin, the minister of communications and a member of Sharon's rightist
Likud Party. Rivlin said he will no longer attend her performances but
does not believe in organizing boycotts against her.</TE>
<TE>   And the minister said the boycott of Beilin by the Beersheba
University professors and lecturers was wrongheaded.</TE>
<TE>   "The professors went too far," he said. "I believe that Beilin is
wrong, I disagree with him, but both of us are ready to give our soul and
body to the existence of Israel. Each believes that the other is bringing
the country to disaster, but Beilin is not doing what he is doing to go
against his country. I respect him and I respect his ideas."</TE>
<TE>   Rivlin worries, he said, "that the gap is becoming unbridgeable"
between the Israeli right and left. "It takes a lot of nerves, a strong
spirit to continue the debate even though the other side sometimes annoys
me."</TE>
<TE>   Shohat said she is disappointed that few Israeli artists have risen to
her mother's defense. Gidi Gov, a well-known pop singer, announced that
he was quitting the Israeli Union of Performing Artists, the group that
canceled its evening of tribute to Yarkoni. Moshe Tene, manager of the
Tzavta Theater in Tel Aviv, announced that the theater would hold its own
tribute to Yarkoni on May 15. But few others have spoken out publicly in
her support.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm already receiving phone calls from artists who want to perform,"
Tene said. "But I'm also receiving phone calls from people who say they
will never set foot in my theater again. People are growing less and less
tolerant. This happened to Yaffa last week, to Beilin the week before.
People and their opinions are being boycotted. Artists are afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Gov said that he was not scheduled to sing at Yarkoni's tribute but
that he will certainly attend the Tzavta evening to show support for the
singer.</TE>
<TE>   "She sang to the soldiers in every war," he said. "Her songs are the
songs from my childhood. She is an elderly woman now, and she said what
she thinks. Maybe many Israelis think the same way, although they would
not say it in these ways. But it doesn't matter to me what she said, it
matters to me that she had no protection."</TE>

<HD>U.N. Delays Its Response to Israel on Jenin Impasse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Sunday after
Israel refused to let a U.N. mission begin investigating the past month's
battles at the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, but it agreed to
defer any official response until after the Israeli Cabinet held a
planned second day of debate on the matter today.</LD>
<LD>   Arab nations had secured support from several council members for a
resolution that would call on Israel to cooperate with the investigation
"without any hindrance or conditions."</LD>
<LD>   But U.S. diplomats said they told a closed-door council meeting that
immediate U.N. intervention could jeopardize an agreement reached with
Israel on Sunday to end its siege of Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat's West Bank headquarters--another key demand of the
Arab-backed resolution.</LD>
<TE>   The council should refrain from acting until the Israeli Cabinet
concluded its deliberations, the Americans argued, implicitly threatening
to use the United States' veto power if the resolution's sponsors forced
a vote.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli diplomats resumed discussions with the U.N. on Sunday
concerning the membership and agenda of the fact-finding mission, U.N.
officials told the council.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we ought to give them a chance to work this out with the
United Nations," U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte said shortly before
the council meeting began.</TE>
<TE>   When the council session adjourned, members said they still hoped that
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan would be able to resolve the impasse
with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect a positive report by tomorrow," said Sergei V. Lavrov, the
ambassador to the U.N. from Russia, which holds the rotating council
presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Annan's aides had informed the council Friday after two days of
negotiations with an Israeli delegation here that they thought they had
satisfied most substantive Israeli objections--a belief shared by Western
diplomats monitoring the talks and by at least some Israeli officials,
according to participants in the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, however, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon reportedly told his
ministers that he remained flatly opposed to the mission, and there were
no signals from Jerusalem that Israel would soften its stance when the
Cabinet took up the issue today.</TE>
<TE>   There was no indication Sunday that the Bush administration has
altered its position on the investigation, which it first backed in a
Security Council vote 10 days ago. Although U.S. officials have urged
Annan to address Israel's specific concerns about the inquiry, they have
also said they expected Israel to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   The fact-finding team, led by former Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, remained in Geneva on Sunday, awaiting instructions from U.N.
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Though council members say the mission does not require Israeli
approval as a legal matter, in practical terms it would be difficult to
conduct the inquiry unless the Israeli army allowed the team access to
the camp and let it interview Israeli soldiers and others who
participated in the battle there.</TE>

<HD>Time for Explanations Not Yet Here, Stunned German City Told</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ERFURT, Germany
</DL>
<LD>Churchgoers crowded into services here Sunday as residents mourned
their losses from a school massacre by a teenage gunman that left 17
people dead last week, including the shooter.</LD>
<LD>   Preaching at the city's main cathedral, Claus-Peter Maerz, a local
priest and theology professor, told the congregation that now is a time
for grieving for those killed in Friday's rampage, not for expecting
answers.</LD>
<LD>   "The time for explanations hasn't come yet, and it will never fully
come," Maerz said. "There will be a time for talking. One will have to
talk about schools and about security, about violence in our society. . .
. But first of all, we will have to listen, to be silent. We will have to
open ourselves up to the pain, and we will have to confront the pain."</LD>
<TE>   In an apparent act of revenge for having been expelled this year,
Robert Steinhaeuser, 19, walked into Johann Gutenberg secondary school
Friday morning and in a 15-minute blood bath killed 13 school employees,
two students and a policeman. The dead included about one-quarter of the
school's teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Shocked education authorities had no plans Sunday for when and where
students could resume classes. Proposals were made to have them return to
the school this week or to divide students among other schools, but the
ideas were dropped or postponed.</TE>
<TE>   After meeting at City Hall on Sunday with students, parents and
teachers, Mayor Manfred Ruge offered them use of space at the building
this week, but for meetings with one another and psychologists rather
than for classroom instruction. Ruge said those at the gathering had
resolved to reopen the school as quickly as possible and "make a new
beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, politicians and other public figures across Germany engaged
in a growing debate over issues highlighted by the incident, including
gun control, violence in entertainment, and the degree to which schools
should enforce high standards through final exams and graduation rules.</TE>
<TE>   Steinhaeuser's expulsion, which was for forging excuse notes for
absences, came while he was repeating his final year of school. Under
particularly strict education rules in the state of Thuringia, of which
Erfurt is the capital, that meant the only diploma he could receive was
one equivalent to finishing ninth grade. That would block him from
attending university and make it difficult for him to get a good job.</TE>
<TE>   "Until 11 a.m. Friday, there was a loud demand in this society for
performance-oriented schools," said Michael Krapp, the state government
minister in charge of education. "Now because of this tragic event,
exactly the opposite is demanded. . . . We have to find the right middle
way."</TE>
<TE>   Erfurt Police Chief Rainer Grube told a news conference Sunday that
investigators searching Steinhaeuser's home found violence-laden comics
and videos as well as several computer games featuring "intensive weapons
usage."</TE>
<TE>   Compact discs confiscated at his home, according to German media
reports, included a song with the English lyrics "Shoot down your naughty
teachers with a pump gun."</TE>
<TE>   Edmund Stoiber, the conservative challenger to Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in national elections set for this year, has reacted to the
killings with a call for a ban on violent video and computer games. His
party said Stoiber would visit Erfurt today. Schroeder came Saturday, and
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer visited Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Sigmar Gabriel, the prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony and a
leading figure in Schroeder's Social Democratic Party, said Sunday that
he too favors tight restrictions on violent video and computer games, but
he charged that Stoiber's call was hypocritical because "it is stated now
very suddenly."</TE>
<TE>   "Most politicians who claim this now," Gabriel said, "have allowed it
for years that night after night, private TV is exclusively showing films
glorifying violence, where young people, especially young men, learn only
about violence as a means for solving conflicts."</TE>
<TE>   A new gun law passed by the lower house of Parliament on Friday--about
the time the school massacre was unfolding--requires licensing of air
pistols, not just regular guns, and imposes stiffer penalties for those
found to possess guns for which they have no permits.</TE>
<TE>   The school killings have prompted calls for further tightening of the
law.</TE>
<TE>   "We propose the government, states and coalition parties sit down next
week to look again at the law in the light of the events in Erfurt," said
Cem Ozdemir, domestic affairs spokesman for the Greens, the junior
partner in government.</TE>
<TE>   There are 10 million legally held weapons in the nation of 83 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Grube said Steinhaeuser's parents had not known of his
expulsion. Education officials said that because Steinhaeuser was older
than 18, school authorities were not responsible for informing them.</TE>

<HD>Russian Politician Lebed Killed in Crash</HD>
<DH>Siberia: At least six others die when helicopter carrying the war
hero goes down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>Alexander I. Lebed, a rough-hewn, gravel-voiced general who once
seemed bound for Russia's highest office until he overreached and found
himself instead in the political wilderness, died Sunday in a helicopter
crash in Siberia. He was 52.</LD>
<LD>   Known for helping to defend the Russian parliament building during a
1991 coup attempt by Communist hard-liners and for ending Russia's first
war in Chechnya in 1996, the blunt yet charismatic combat veteran had
been serving since 1998 as governor of the vast and sparsely populated
Krasnoyarsk territory.</LD>
<LD>   At least six other people were killed and about a dozen seriously
injured when Lebed's chartered M-8 helicopter reportedly snagged a power
line while approaching the party's destination near Yermakovo. Lebed was
in the area to attend a ceremony dedicating a new ski area in the Sayan
Mountains.</LD>
<TE>   According to colleagues, Lebed's decision to set off Sunday morning
despite poor visibility was typical of his restless spirit and lifelong
disregard for his safety.</TE>
<TE>   "He said many times that taking risks was in his blood--as a
paratrooper he made 368 jumps, all of them successful," recalled Lyudmila
V. Selivanova, the former first deputy head of the Krasnoyarsk
territorial administration, who had worked with Lebed since 1998. "He
always treated fate and security concerns lightly."</TE>
<TE>   But because Lebed had recently been involved in intense power
struggles over control of his territory's lucrative nickel and aluminum
industries, questions were raised by some politicians that the fatal
flight might have been sabotaged. Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
promised a thorough investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Lebed, a native of southern Russia whose ancestors included Cossacks
of the Don River region, had a penchant for pithy utterances--delivered
in his trademark basso growl--that stayed in the public mind. "He who
shoots first laughs last," he once observed. Another time, to show
disdain of critics, he noted, "The dogs bark, but the caravan passes."</TE>
<TE>   A hero of Russia's war in Afghanistan during the 1980s, he rocketed to
political superstardom in Russia in 1995 after being relieved of his army
command in the Trans-Dniester region. The dismissal followed years of
bickering with then-Defense Minister Gen. Pavel S. Grachev over what
Lebed viewed as misguided army reforms--and what Grachev considered to be
Lebed's habitual insubordination.</TE>
<TE>   During three years as the head of Russia's 14th Army in
Trans-Dniester, Lebed imposed peace in the troubled breakaway section of
the former Soviet republic of Moldova and gave the army's protection to
ethnic Russians there who said they were under threat.</TE>
<TE>   Lebed's tough-guy stances, unvarnished patriotism and apparent freedom
from any hint of corruption won public approval. He entered the Duma, the
lower house of parliament, after leaving the army. The following year, he
was popular enough to challenge incumbent Boris N. Yeltsin for the
presidency. A frank militarist, Lebed made no secret of his admiration
for strong leaders such as France's Charles de Gaulle or Chile's Gen.
Augusto Pinochet. He once argued that "preserving the army is the basis
for preserving the government."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, Lebed came in third in the 1996 election, behind
Yeltsin and the Communist standard-bearer, Gennady A. Zyuganov. To win
Lebed's crucial endorsement for the second round of voting, Yeltsin
promised him a significant say in the next administration. After the
election, Lebed was named the president's national security
advisor--charged with resolving the war against separatists in the
Russian republic of Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Handed a seemingly impossible task, Lebed went to Chechnya to
negotiate with the rebels, engineered a cease-fire and agreed to withdraw
Russian troops.</TE>
<TE>   At the height of his popularity, with Yeltsin ailing and preparing for
open-heart surgery, Lebed went too far. He hinted that it was time for
the president to cede power to him.</TE>
<TE>   After Yeltin's operation, the revitalized president quickly fired the
retired general.</TE>
<TE>   Driven from government, Lebed could only chafe from a distance. He
finally ran for governor of Krasnoyarsk in 1998--backed by wealthy
business interests--presumably to establish a base from which to run for
the presidency in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   But Yeltsin trumped Lebed by unexpectedly resigning Dec. 31, 1999, and
handing the presidency to Putin, who was then prime minister. The new
president rapidly eclipsed his rivals in popularity, in part by pursuing
a new war in Chechnya, and Lebed found himself more sidelined than ever.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Lebed had been much more a regional player
than an important figure on the national stage. Yet the eulogies that
poured in Sunday reflected the lingering fascination felt for him. For
all his faults and blunders, he remained for many a figure of romance and
daring.</TE>
<TE>   "Alexander Ivanovich did not allow death to take him when he was
either sick or old. Nor did he die in retirement. He died like a true
combat general--unexpectedly, while still in his prime, right at work. He
died like a true soldier--with his boots on," said his erstwhile
colleague, Selivanova.</TE>
<TE>   "To a large extent Lebed has helped create the image of a new type of
officer in Russia--a type for a democratic Russia," noted Oleg Morozov, a
Duma deputy. "He was valiant, disobedient, proud and independent, [a
person] who was willing to relinquish all posts and start everything over
from scratch" for what he believed.</TE>

<HD>Privatizing Schools: The Philadelphia Experiment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA
</DL>
<LD>Kenny Gamble spent the 1960s and '70s spinning out silky
rhythm-and-blues hits as a chart-topping songwriter and producer. Lately
he's been trying to chart a new direction for his boyhood neighborhood in
South Philadelphia. On streets pockmarked with decay, his Universal Cos.
has built homes, developed new shops and sponsored job training. Progress
has often been grudging, but the group has gained enough of a foothold to
dramatically raise its sights: It is hoping to construct 2,000 homes in
the next half decade.</LD>
<LD>   The crime rate, the local job market and willingness of banks to
invest in a troubled neighborhood will help determine whether the group
can even approach that goal. But ask Gamble to isolate the key factor in
success and his answer is unequivocal: Fix the local public schools. "You
have to straighten out the education in order to get people to purchase
homes in this area," he says.</LD>
<LD>   Gamble has his finger on a central challenge to the fledging
renaissance of urban America. With crime down and unemployment still
modest, poorly performing public schools now may be the biggest factor
driving out upwardly mobile working families from big cities. It probably
won't ever be possible to stabilize struggling urban neighborhoods if
parents flee for better suburban schools as soon as they can set aside
enough money for the U-Haul.</LD>
<TE>   Recognizing that is easy. The hard part is improving urban schools
enough so parents with an option want to stay. Nowhere is the need for
improvement greater than in Philadelphia. And now, under a sweeping plan
approved this month by a state panel, nowhere are school officials
pursuing a bolder, or riskier, reform strategy. Amid a firestorm of local
controversy, the city is becoming the test case of whether it's possible
to significantly improve public schools by placing them under the control
of new managers--including neighborhood groups like Gamble's and private,
for-profit companies.</TE>
<TE>   To put it mildly, city officials didn't volunteer for this test. But,
after the Philadelphia schools suffered persistent budget shortfalls, the
state seized them last year and invested control in a new School Reform
Commission. Republican Gov. Mark Schweiker appointed three of the
commission's five members; Philadelphia's Democratic Mayor John Street
named the other two.</TE>
<TE>   This month, the new commission voted, precisely along those 3-2 lines,
to undertake the nation's largest experiment in the privatization of
public schools. The commission placed 42 of the city's most poorly
performing 264 public schools under the control of six outside managers,
starting next September. Gamble's Universal Cos. will take control of two
neighborhood schools. Edison Schools, the largest private company
operating public schools, was given 20, more than double the number it
operates in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the commission wasn't through. It restructured the
management of an additional 28 schools. Some will become independent and
charter schools largely free from district control, while the rest will
turn over their entire staffs in a process known as "reconstitution." No
city this big has ever revamped so many of its schools at once.</TE>
<TE>   James Nevels, an African American businessman who Schweiker appointed
to chair the commission, calls these "serious measures" for a system in
"serious trouble." Like other urban school districts, Philadelphia has
its islands of excellence. Thousands of teachers, principals and
counselors provide caring support for students every day. But as a
system, the Philadelphia schools are failing. The dropout rate is high
and achievement is low--more than half of the students are scoring below
basic levels of competence on state reading and math tests.</TE>
<TE>   The school commission's response is built on the same logic as the
education reform legislation President Bush steered through Congress last
year: It trades greater flexibility for tougher accountability. While the
new managers of Philadelphia schools will operate with increased freedom
from the central school district, they will also face demanding
performance standards; under the plan, they can lose their contract for
any school where a majority of students fails to reach the average score
on state tests after three years. Charles Zogby, the state education
secretary, says the goal is "to introduce a more market-based reform into
public education . . . where you have a diverse set of providers . . .
but everybody is under the same accountability measures."</TE>
<TE>   Such logic hasn't diminished resistance to the changes from the local
teacher union and some civil rights groups. Edison, which operates 136
public schools in 53 cities, has been the flash point, with critics
denouncing the idea of a private firm profiting from public education.
Yet, as Gamble notes, people have always made money by working for public
schools or providing them services. "The right question is whether those
people are doing a good job."</TE>
<TE>   Gamble's insight offers the best framework for assessing the
Philadelphia plan. The test shouldn't be whether the reforms
inconvenience adults but whether they help kids. Likewise, Edison
shouldn't be judged on whether it profits from its association with
schoolchildren but whether the kids profit from their association with
Edison. The company has posted intriguing but uneven results elsewhere;
Philadelphia will be its most revealing test yet.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest threat here may be unrealistic expectations. Fractured
families and chaotic neighborhoods explain the problems in big-city
schools at least as much as failures by teachers or administrators. No
one has yet demonstrated that any set of educational reforms can entirely
overcome those corrosive social forces.</TE>
<TE>   These initiatives aren't likely to prove a silver bullet either. When
Gamble's group takes control of its neighborhood schools, it may find
that it too is unable to fully reverse the grinding effects of poverty or
overcome the years lost for children whose parents never read them a
bedtime story. But it's hard to see how Philadelphia can lose by letting
Gamble, Edison and the other new managers try new approaches. In a system
that fails to educate so many of its students, the status quo seems
infinitely riskier than change.</TE>

<HD>Biker Charged in Shootings at Casino</HD>
<DH>Crime: Police in Nevada say a hotel surveillance tape shows a man
affiliated with the Hells Angels killing a member of the rival Mongols.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>LAUGHLIN, Nev.
</DL>
<LD>As motorcycle enthusiasts rode out of town Sunday, a 33-year-old
affiliate of the Hells Angels bike gang faced a murder charge related to
the shooting deaths of three bikers at the Laughlin River Run.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas police would not release details on the jailed suspect,
Calvin Brett Schaefer. A jail clerk said he was being held on a charge of
murder with a deadly weapon with intent to promote/assist a criminal
gang. A person answering the phone at Schaefer's residence in Chandler,
Ariz., declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   Lt. Vincent Cannito said about 500 people were detained for
questioning after the shooting early Saturday, and others were arrested
on minor unrelated charges. Dozens of motorcycles were confiscated, as
well as guns, knives, hammers and other weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Motorcycle gang experts said the shootout is the latest in an
increasingly violent power struggle among biker gangs.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel surveillance tapes reviewed by police show the deadly chain of
events at Harrah's Casino &amp; Hotel about 2:15 a.m. Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   At first, several members of the Hells Angels gang surrounded two
members of the rival Mongols. A fistfight broke out and quickly
escalated. The tape then shows one of the Mongols being shot.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the Hells Angels guys pulls out a gun and pops him in the
head, and after that, it's just pandemonium," said Sgt. Chuck Jones of
the Las Vegas Police Department. The department has jurisdiction over the
casino town, 100 miles southeast of Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   At least 12 people were taken to hospitals, mostly for gunshot or
knife wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Neither the Clark County coroner nor police would release the names of
the three dead.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said
investigators still do not know whether the melee was related to the
death of a 28-year-old San Diego man found on Interstate 40, the artery
linking Southern California and Laughlin. Police said Christian Tate was
probably shot as he rode his motorcycle. His bike and some shell casings
were found.</TE>
<TE>   Tate's aunt, Cindi Tate Cirone, said her nephew loved motorcycles and
had been in the Coast Guard. She said her family is in shock and has
heard little about what happened or why.</TE>
<TE>   Similar gang shootouts have been occurring across the nation in
increasing numbers this year.</TE>
<TE>   In February, police arrested 23 members of the Outlaw gang outside a
club in Revere, Mass., where they were heavily armed and ready for battle
with Hells Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The same month, 73 members of the Pagan Motorcycle Club were arrested
and charged with federal racketeering in New York after a fight at a
motorcycle and tattoo expo sponsored by the Hells Angels on Long Island.
A member of the Hells Angels from New York was charged with the killing
of a Pagan. Five other gang members were shot, five were stabbed and two
suffered heart attacks during the melee.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Terry Katz, a gang expert with the Maryland State Police, said
motorcycle gangs are growing and encroaching on each other's turf. "Too
many people, too much territory. Something's going to pop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Charles T. Mathews, a Pasadena lawyer who has represented Mongol
bikers, said he doubts the group provoked the Laughlin fight. The group
has tamed its ways since May 2000, when federal agents arrested at least
42 members in Southern California and seized dozens of illegal guns,
cocaine and stolen motorcycles.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hells Angels have had several instances in which they have gone
out of their way to cause trouble or start problems with the Mongols,"
Mathews said. "I know for a fact that the Mongols have tried very, very
hard since the series of busts . . . to stay out of trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Hells Angels leader George Christie Jr. could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, bikers attending the River Run said they are not afraid to
return next year. The four-day event, in its 20th year, is one of the
nation's largest motorcycle festivals, drawing as many as 80,000
visitors.</TE>
<TE>   A steady stream of riders gathered Sunday at the Texaco station on the
edge of town, filling up on gas for their journeys home.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Dix, who drove 600 miles from Grand Junction, Colo., said bike
clubs typically don't let tension escalate at large rallies. "It does
reflect badly on us," said Dix, who said he's not affiliated with any of
the clubs. "Most people are just like me. They weren't involved in it.
They didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be back next year," said Robert Torres of Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, Lorenzo, added: "Harrah's just has to keep it a little
bit more secure next time."</TE>
<TE>   Others left with more negative feelings. Mark Scheidecker of
Albuquerque said he was handcuffed and held in a banquet room with
members of the Hells Angels because he was outside of Harrah's after the
melee. Scheidecker said he is not a gang member.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not coming back--ever," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Don Laughlin, the town's namesake who owns a hotel there, said he
doesn't think the River Run should be canceled because of the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of keeping the gangs out of town," he said. ". . .
Just because you get two bad groups, you don't shut down the town."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Laughlin said the altercation may increase knowledge of the
town, home to nine casinos and about 11,000 hotel rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Since the incident, he has received calls from associates as far away
as Mongolia and Ireland asking about events.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the world knows where Laughlin is now," said Laughlin,
who has done business there for 36 years. "They always say any kind of
news is good news. It's very unfortunate that someone had to get hurt and
killed over it."</TE>

<LD>Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel was once suspended from a private
school in Vermont after threatening a teacher's wife with a ski pole said
Richard Wright, founder of The Vershire School.</LD>
<LD>   Skakel, a nephew of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is charged in the
beating death of Martha Moxley, who was killed in their wealthy Greenwich
neighborhood in 1975. Both were 15 at the time.</LD>
<LD>   Wright said Skakel was sent home after threatening to strike Jane
Taupier during a 1978 confrontation in a dormitory staircase. Taupier and
her husband lived in a dorm with Skakel and 25 other students, Wright
said.</LD>

<LD>The Federal Railroad Administration has instituted a special safety
watch on financially ailing Amtrak, and Amtrak operating officials have
begun a series of "safety blitzes" to caution all train crews,
maintenance forces and shop workers to remain alert.</LD>
<LD>   No recent major accidents or passenger injuries have been attributed
to Amtrak employees distracted by the company's financial problems or
their own job prospects. The number of serious rules violations, however,
has soared this month, and the 20 violations so far in April ties the
worst month in recent years.</LD>

<HD>No Abuse Rule Yet, Boston Prelate Says</HD>
<DH>Church: Cardinal Law tells worshipers that bishops will discuss a
policy for priests in June.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON
</DL>
<LD>Making his first public address since his return from an emergency
Vatican summit, Cardinal Bernard Law told Sunday worshipers here that a
national policy about clerical sexual abuse will not be established
before a U.S. bishops meeting in June.</LD>
<LD>   Celebrating Mass at Holy Cross cathedral, Law said: "The focus of that
meeting will be the whole question of sexual abuse of minors by clergy,
and how the church can respond to that issue."</LD>
<LD>   He stressed that no matter what comes out of the June gathering in
Dallas of about 400 U.S. bishops, "we have to have the concurrence of the
Holy See," the Vatican.</LD>
<TE>   Law's remarks preceded the liturgical portion of a service that filled
fewer than half of the pews in the cavernous cathedral in Boston's South
End. Many in the audience had been bused in from local Latino
communities; a contingent of nuns and monks also was present. Law's
official spokeswoman, Donna M. Morrissey, stood by the door as worshipers
using wheelchairs were escorted into the sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal made no reference to the recent disclosure that Father
Paul Shanley, a Boston priest charged with abusing young boys for
decades, had tried to blackmail the church. Nor did Law touch on rumors
that his future in Boston may be tenuous.</TE>
<TE>   He used businesslike terms to describe an unprecedented meeting in
Rome last week between Pope John Paul II and the cardinals of the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "What we were able to do was to express our opinions, individually,"
Law said. "This past week we were not there to make decisions."</TE>
<TE>   He said the cardinals endorsed the goal of "a national set of
guidelines for these cases which would have a more binding force."</TE>
<TE>   A similar idea proposed in the early 1980s by a committee of priests
and canon lawyers was not pursued by church leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Law made no direct reference to victims in his comments. But in coming
forth to offer "prayers for the faithful," Joseph Doolin, head of the
diocese's Catholic Charities, focused on men and women who have been
molested by priests.</TE>
<TE>   The steady ritual of Mass inside the cathedral contrasted with the
scene on the street outside. Since January, when reports in the Boston
Globe showed that church officials knew about abuse allegations against
former priest John J. Geoghan--yet moved him from parish to parish
anyway--the number of protesters has grown each Sunday. Their messages
also have become increasingly more pointed.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in an icy rain, several of the more than 60 protesters said
they have amassed small collections of signs customized to reflect the
newest developments in the church scandal.</TE>
<TE>   "I try to make them appropriate in keeping with the latest statement
or faux pas the cardinal makes," said Joyce Cannon, a 57-year-old nurse
who said she has missed only one Sunday on the church steps since
January. Her placard Sunday read: "Lies, Deception, Manipulation,
Control=CULT=Catholic Church."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the youngest protesters were 6-year-old twins from Hopkinton,
west of Boston. Carolyn Monahan's sign read: "Law, You Made a Bad
Decision--Jesus is Mad At You." Her sister Allison wrote "Mean Priest,
Cardinal Law" on her sign.</TE>
<TE>   Allison said she picked the message because "I am a kid. If I was one
of those kids who got really hurt by a priest, I would be really sad."</TE>

<HD>Skeptics Wary of Impending INS Split</HD>
<DH>Restructuring: Details are sketchy about how the two new bureaus
would be organized.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL</AU>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It took a national calamity, but it now seems inevitable that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service--long the target of derision, even
contempt, from the borderlands to the corridors of Congress--will be
replaced.</LD>
<LD>   An overwhelming House vote on Thursday probably ensures that the INS
will be eliminated, its duties shifted to new bureaus in the Justice
Department.</LD>
<LD>   Concluded Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), architect of the
House plan: "We must practice tough love and abolish the INS."</LD>
<TE>   Yet the question lingers: What will emerge in its place?</TE>
<TE>   The Senate also has a plan to do away with the INS. Both proposals
would split the agency's two core missions--serving the immigrant
population, while watching borders and enforcing immigration
laws--between a pair of new bureaus, each with its own budget. Under both
plans, the title of INS commissioner would be changed, although a single
official would remain at the helm of immigration policy.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the plans offer varying prescriptions with sketchy
details. Nitty-gritty decisions about where to open enforcement and
service offices or how personnel might be redeployed probably will be
made down the line.</TE>
<TE>   Such changes, lawmakers predict, will pay off in a newly efficient
immigration bureaucracy, one that can do a better job of keeping out
terrorists and other criminals while also reducing illegal immigration
and improving the INS' woeful service record.</TE>
<TE>   For all the political momentum, some wonder: Is this a well-reasoned
response to a long-recognized dilemma? Or a flailing act of frustration
and political expediency? Will redrawing the organizational chart solve
the seemingly intractable problems in U.S. immigration policy?</TE>
<TE>   "It could make things somewhat better--or considerably worse," said
former INS Commissioner Doris Meissner, whose Clinton administration
reign included one of several internal agency reorganizations in recent
years. "It by no means is going to solve all the problems in the
immigration area."</TE>
<TE>   On the near horizon, some skeptics already perceive the glimmer of
folly.</TE>
<TE>   "You have got one inefficient, unproductive INS now," said Rep. Melvin
L. Watt (D-N.C.), one of the few opponents of the House measure to split
up the service. "It seems to me that what you are going to end up with is
two inefficient agencies."</TE>
<TE>Reorganization Won't Cure All Agency Ills</TE>
<TE>   Critics are quick to note what the breakup of the INS, in and of
itself, is not likely to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   It does not alter U.S. immigration policy, which continues to struggle
with competing aims of facilitating legitimate arrivals and closing the
door to those barred from entry--a struggle that has become even more
difficult since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It does not modernize the service's inefficient technology or
transform its hodgepodge of uncoordinated information systems and lax
internal discipline.</TE>
<TE>   It does not address the powerful pressures behind unlawful
immigration. Nor does the INS' demise mean that the agency's heirs
suddenly will be magnets for talented managers.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, the architects of reform are placing enormous faith in the
notion that improvements can arise from a more efficient chain of
command, and what they view as a more logical division of work
responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Few argue seriously that the INS alone could have averted the attacks
of Sept. 11, which were carried out by 19 Middle Eastern men who had
entered the country on legal visas.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Sept. 11 strikes transformed immigration from a back-burner
discussion centering on possible amnesty for illegal immigrants from
Mexico into a high-stakes debate about national security. And the INS'
sluggish response only reinforced its image as a lumbering behemoth
lurching from one crisis to the next.</TE>
<TE>   In the charged aftermath of Sept. 11, the INS acknowledged that it had
no idea where to find multitudes of foreign students and other short-term
visitors--not to mention 300,000 people already ordered deported, many
with criminal records. The illegal immigrant population, meantime, is
believed to have surged past 8 million--approximately the population of
Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers pounced on an agency that, by one estimate, generates six
times as many complaints to congressional staffs as the Internal Revenue
Service. The disastrous mailing of visa approvals to a pair of dead
hijackers last month sealed the service's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "The INS is going into the wastebasket of history," declared Rep. Bob
Barr (R-Ga.). "We need to shred it, gather the shreds, burn them, gather
the ashes and distribute them among the four corners of this world so
this agency . . . can never . . . endanger our security and be a disgrace
to this country."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional and White House efforts to retool the INS share a common
diagnosis: Many of the agency's woes can be traced to its two very
different missions.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, the enforcement side, especially the politically
popular Border Patrol, has attracted the bulk of agency funding. Some
doubt that long-entrenched pattern will change in the new
configuration--and there is fear of a stealth agenda to slash service
budgets.</TE>
<TE>   Backlogs and mismanagement have left legitimate applicants waiting in
line for years. The queue now exceeds 5 million pending applications and
petitions--a fourfold increase since 1994. As one step to addressing such
frustrations, the congressional plans would create an ombudsman's office
to monitor and improve the service side of the equation.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while enthusiasts of an INS breakup maintain that it would usher
in a more user-friendly era, some immigration experts say there are
dangers in separating the enforcement and service functions. The two
areas inevitably overlap, such as when adjudicators processing claims for
citizenship or permanent resident status find evidence of fraud or other
criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   "We need very close linkages between immigration enforcement and
benefits," said David Martin, former INS general counsel, now a law
professor at the University of Virginia. "The problems of the agency have
not primarily been problems of organization."</TE>
<TE>   The projected INS abolition, Martin noted, does not resolve a
fundamental policy conundrum: "Sometimes the American people want
enforcement," he said, "but at other times we wonder, 'Why is the INS
hassling my friend?' "</TE>
<TE>   That the INS is suffering from "mission overload" while terminally at
cross-purposes with itself seems beyond dispute. Border Patrol agents
track down illegal immigrants but also scramble to rescue those trapped
in desert and mountain terrain.</TE>
<TE>   INS investigators in places such as Los Angeles and New York seek out
certain illegal immigrants--while virtually ignoring many others who live
largely without fear of detection.</TE>
<TE>   In February, INS inspectors at Los Angeles International Airport were
appalled to receive a memo from management directing them "not to
respond" to concerns from airlines about illegal immigrants boarding
planes.</TE>
<TE>   "With all respect, . . . our management's approach to the problem is
to tell us what we cannot do to stop this illegal entry," one officer
wrote in a widely distributed e-mail response. "God help the American
public."</TE>
<TE>Policies Differ Around the Country</TE>
<TE>   Congressional reformers are also hoping that the overhaul will shift
power to Washington from regional immigration offices, where influential
district directors issue broad policy proclamations sometimes at variance
with national guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, decisions regarding detention of people facing
deportation may vary greatly from one district to another. Likewise,
emphasis on citizenship services and assisting immigrants with
adjudication matters may be different from city to city.</TE>
<TE>   "The culture and the focus of the INS have to change, whether it's one
agency or many," said Carl Shusterman, a lawyer in Los Angeles who
formerly worked as an INS attorney. "Benefits need to be expedited and
not begrudged. . . ."</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, much of the debate will center on how much power is
vested in the chief of the realigned agency. Critics of the House
legislation say the job description of the proposed boss--a new associate
attorney general who would oversee the bureaus--sounds too much like a
caretaker, thus opening the door to further snafus in communication and
lack of coordination.</TE>
<TE>   "We need the dean or the principal--not the guidance counselor," said
Larry Gonzalez, Washington director of the National Assn. of Latino
Elected and Appointed Officials.</TE>
<TE>   All agree that potential improvements in the INS and border security
go beyond the fine points of competing reorganization charts. A separate
congressional bill would tighten visa procedures, bolster inspections at
borders and ports of entry, and institute a system to track all foreign
students and visitors from entry until departure.</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that current high immigration levels--with about 1
million new arrivals each year, along with many more short-term
visitors--overwhelm the system. Historically, Congress has heaped new
tasks upon the INS without sufficient funding or political backing.</TE>
<TE>   "They're unwilling to face the fact that INS is broken because
immigration policy is broken--not because bureaucrats have the wrong
titles on their business cards," said Mark Krikorian, executive director
of the Center for Immigration Reform, a group that favors fewer
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the INS, the painful buildup toward the dissolution of the
agency has been as uplifting as hearing the executioner's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "You can imagine how incredibly demoralized the agency is, how
difficult this is in terms of people staying focused on their work and
moving ahead," said former commissioner Meissner, adding: "The single
most important thing, I would argue, is to get this settled one way or
another."</TE>

<HD>Tax Cut Clouds Bush's Urban Agenda</HD>
<DH>Policy: Critics say the government won't have enough money to give
big cities needed help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush will arrive in Los Angeles today bearing a more
ambitious urban agenda than his father offered after the city's riots 10
years ago--but still facing charges that his tax cut has made it
impossible for Washington to meaningfully confront the most pressing
problems facing big cities.</LD>
<LD>   Bush has spent much more time in urban settings than his father,
former President Bush, whose failure to respond more aggressively to the
1992 Los Angeles riots may have been a turning point in his defeat that
year by Bill Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   And compared to his father, Bush has offered more comprehensive
proposals to reform schools and the welfare system, to invigorate
government partnerships with religious charities, and to encourage
homeownership in the cities.</LD>
<TE>   These initiatives generally have won Bush more praise from Democrats
than almost anything else in his domestic agenda. Yet Bush continues to
draw criticism from Democrats and some urban experts not so much for what
he is doing in the cities as for what he isn't.</TE>
<TE>   Many critics argue that the $1.3-trillion tax cut Bush pushed through
Congress last year--coupled with the unexpected costs of the war against
terrorism--has denied government the funds to make significant
investments in urban problems from schools to public safety. "The tax cut
. . . will probably crowd out the ability to make the kind of investments
that are needed," says Bruce Katz, a former Clinton administration
official who now directs the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at
the Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials reject that analysis, pointing to increased
funding for federal programs aimed at high-poverty public schools and a
tax credit Bush has proposed to encourage urban homeownership. "Critics
of the administration are always going to talk about the tax cut," one
White House aide said, "but I don't think it is going to affect our
ability to put money into good programs."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, these arguments echo the campaign debate over the cities
between Clinton and former President Bush that flashed after the 1992
riots.</TE>
<TE>   Though policy affecting the cities did not remain a central issue in
that campaign, the Los Angeles riots still may have been a pivotal
moment. When they erupted, Clinton was badly bruised by a Democratic
primary victory that had raised questions about his honesty and
integrity.</TE>
<TE>   But Clinton reacted quickly to the riots. In a series of speeches and
a dramatic visit to South-Central Los Angeles, he offered an extensive
series of policies that blended new government spending in areas such as
education, calls for personal responsibility and efforts to encourage
greater private investment in the cities.</TE>
<TE>   Former President Bush, meanwhile, appeared hesitant. Initially he
emphasized law-and-order themes in denouncing the rioters. He didn't tour
Los Angeles until a week after the violence began--three days after
Clinton. And, rather than offering new ideas, the president repeated
initiatives he already had proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Kemp, Bush's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who
accompanied the president on the trip, says the charge that he was not
interested in the cities was unfair. But some believe Bush's failure to
respond more aggressively helped cement the image that he lacked an
agenda for, or even much interest in, domestic problems.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, during his presidential campaign, the younger Bush
visited urban neighborhoods more frequently than most Republican
candidates to highlight his ideas for reforming schools and increasing
government partnerships with faith-based charities.</TE>
<TE>   Tellingly, in Los Angeles today, Bush will visit the community
development arm of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church--the same
church that was Clinton's first stop when he toured Los Angeles after the
riots.</TE>
<TE>   "Bush is uncommonly at home," says Kemp, who for many years has urged
the GOP to court minorities. "He's very much at ease in an urban
setting."</TE>
<TE>   In substance, Bush's approach to urban issues lands somewhere between
his father's agenda (which was heavily influenced by Kemp's ideas) and
Clinton's. Bush's agenda shares several common themes with
Clinton's--such as rewarding work, encouraging homeownership and spurring
community action. But Bush generally supports a government role much more
limited than Clinton preferred, and more expansive than his father would
accept.</TE>
<TE>   Education is one example. The elder Bush built his education reform
agenda around vouchers that parents could use to send their children to
private schools.</TE>
<TE>   Though the younger Bush also supports vouchers, he constructed the
education reform bill he steered through Congress last year around a
federal mandate that states annually test students in reading and
math--and undertake corrective actions in schools that persistently fail
to improve student performance. That was a more intrusive federal role
than conservatives usually prefer, but the bill passed with broad
Democratic support.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, though, has opposed Clinton-era ideas popular among Democrats to
increase federal spending on education. Among those ideas are reducing
class sizes, expanding the availability of preschool, and subsidizing new
school construction. Some Democratic allies on the reform bill are now
accusing him of failing to adequately fund it.</TE>
<TE>   Homeownership issues show a similar pattern.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Bush's agenda was limited to a modest plan of helping
tenants in public housing buy their units. Clinton emphasized a series of
federal regulatory actions--including tougher enforcement of fair lending
and community reinvestment laws--meant to prod banks to offer more urban
mortgages. That pressure helped raise homeownership among blacks and
Latinos to the highest level ever recorded.</TE>
<TE>   The younger Bush hasn't fully signaled his attitude toward those
regulatory efforts. But he has proposed a tax credit for developers who
build homes in low-income neighborhoods, and aides say the White House is
finalizing additional proposals to encourage more private investment in
urban areas.</TE>
<TE>   That's likely to draw support from at least some Democrats. Many urban
Democrats, such as former HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, also praise
Bush for supporting high levels of immigration--which has provided a
vital source of energy and population for cities that had been losing
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   But, echoing a common Democratic complaint, Cisneros argues that these
efforts may be "overshadowed" by the disappearance of the government's
budget surplus.</TE>
<TE>   "The future effects of the tax cut could undo a lot of the good of
what [he's done] . . . because there just won't be the resources," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Counters Ronald Utt, a senior research fellow at the conservative
Heritage Foundation: "The real question is whether any of these programs
make any difference in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, urban issues have attracted relatively little
attention--partly because the 1990s boom improved conditions in most
cities, and partly because both parties have been focused primarily on
suburban swing voters.</TE>
<TE>   But the Democratic criticism suggests that another big-city explosion
would present this President Bush with a debate similar to the one his
father faced. Though even most critics acknowledge that the younger Bush
has demonstrated more concern about urban problems, they say the tax cut
has enfeebled his ability to respond--leaving him, in effect, with more
will than wallet, as his father once said.</TE>

<HD>The Voice of Hollywood Shows Signs of Cracking</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Media companies' competing interests threaten a
lobbying alliance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>When an influential U.S. senator introduced legislation last month
to help entertainment companies block unauthorized downloading of movies
and music, the Motion Picture Assn. of America--the official voice of
major Hollywood studios--dutifully presented a united front and endorsed
the bill.</LD>
<LD>   Behind the scenes, however, the carefully crafted statement of support
was the subject of painstaking negotiations, bickering and a flurry of
tense meetings and conference calls by the companies' chief Washington
lobbyists, who were anything but united.</LD>
<LD>   The internal jostling over the copyright bill is the latest sign that
the traditional Hollywood alliance in Washington is starting to fray.
Major studios, once unified on Capitol Hill, are increasingly at odds
over legislative strategies and government regulation and, occasionally,
with one another.</LD>
<TE>   "I keep telling everyone that no matter how powerful they are as a
company, no one is powerful enough to face the government alone," MPAA
President Jack Valenti said.</TE>
<TE>   The divergent viewpoints reflect the new realities of the
entertainment business. Gone are the days when the studios simply made
movies. During the last few years, MPAA members have evolved into mammoth
media conglomerates with international operations and competing interests
beyond their filmmaking operations.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc., for example, not only makes movies but is the
country's largest Internet company and the second-biggest cable operator.
Sony Pictures' parent also is an electronics giant. Walt Disney Co.,
Viacom Inc. and News Corp. have substantial broadcast operations. Vivendi
Universal is the world's largest music company.</TE>
<TE>   During his decades-long tenure as the industry's leading voice in
Washington, Valenti never has confronted such fractiousness. His strong
personality and stature often have kept the studios from splintering.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's getting harder," he said. "No question about it."</TE>
<TE>   The clashes in Washington are becoming more frequent and public.</TE>
<TE>   Disney, for example, actively lobbied government regulators to kill or
modify the AOL merger with Time Warner two years ago, saying the combined
company's cable and Internet operations would give it an unfair
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp., meanwhile, is fighting to kill the attempt by satellite
broadcaster EchoStar Communications Corp. to acquire DirecTV, which News
Corp. wants to buy itself. That has been painful to Vivendi, now an
investor in EchoStar.</TE>
<TE>   When the Federal Trade Commission blasted the industry for marketing
R-rated movies to teens, the studios were unable to agree on a unified
response and Disney was accused of trying to upstage the others by
rushing out with a separate set of marketing guidelines. The disagreement
among the companies prompted a scolding from lawmakers during Senate
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "They were all over the map," recalled one congressional staffer.</TE>
<TE>   The strong personalities of the key entertainment lobbyists--a mix of
attorneys and former political aides--also have complicated relations
among the entertainment companies.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a family that can have dysfunctional moments, though I wouldn't
call us a dysfunctional family," said Matt Gerson, head of Vivendi
Universal's Washington office, who increasingly finds himself mediating
among the different factions. Lately that means smoothing clashes between
AOL and Disney.</TE>
<TE>   Gerson said many of the companies, including his own, are rethinking
old policies and positions as their businesses grow and diversify,
leading to some disharmony.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's recent acquisitions of MP3.com and EMusic, for instance,
have made the company more sympathetic to calls by other online music
providers to streamline music licensing.</TE>
<TE>   "As we get into these online services ourselves," Gerson said, "it
causes a different perspective in how we look at these issues."</TE>
<TE>   Gerson, a former aide to Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), often uses his
old skills as a political strategist, working behind the scenes, nudging
one side or another toward compromise. He also has a special bond with
Valenti, thanks to a stint at the MPAA in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack's role isn't so much to be a Michael Corleone. It's more like
Michael Brady," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Frequently joining Gerson in the role of MPAA centrist is Viacom
lobbyist Carol Melton. It may be no coincidence that she and Gerson have
sat at the MPAA table the longest.</TE>
<TE>   Melton, who spent a decade at Time Warner before taking the helm of
Viacom's Washington office in 1997, is seen as a focused pragmatist.</TE>
<TE>   "To fight each other on Capitol Hill or any other forum does not
increase your chance of success," she said. "I've seen the importance of
staying balanced and levelheaded. You rarely accomplish your objectives
without building a consensus."</TE>
<TE>   To help keep peace among the players, Valenti referees a weekly
conference call and insists that the entertainment companies come
together at least once a month for a face-to-face meeting at the motion
picture association's headquarters. Serving as an inspiration for
teamwork, the second-floor conference room is decorated with
black-and-white photos of famous Hollywood couples.</TE>
<TE>   Discussions are lively and occasionally heated.</TE>
<TE>   "They're awful sometimes," said chief Disney lobbyist Preston Padden,
whose combative style frequently puts him at odds with the others. "No
apologies," Padden said when asked about his take-no-prisoners approach.</TE>
<TE>   Some MPAA members were miffed that Padden effectively forced the group
to choose sides and confront the sensitive copyright issue by prodding
Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) to introduce the anti-piracy
legislation. Others, however, privately expressed appreciation for
Padden's willingness to take on the dirty work.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would require technology firms and entertainment companies to
agree upon anti-piracy protections for television set-top boxes and other
devices within 18 months. Otherwise, the government could step in and
settle the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Disney wants the law passed because the Burbank-based company would be
devastated by the loss of its exclusive copyrights to such lucrative
characters as Mickey Mouse. Padden urged a quick MPAA endorsement of the
legislation.</TE>
<TE>   But AOL Time Warner and Sony Pictures balked, fearing that the measure
would give the government too much power to set technological standards
better left to the private sector. AOL lobbyists began circulating a
rival proposal, which called for a narrower government role.</TE>
<TE>   Disney argued that AOL and Sony could not be objective because of
their vast technology businesses, which benefit from the increasing
number of people who download movies and music.</TE>
<TE>   But Susan Brophy, a former Clinton administration aide who took the
helm of AOL Time Warner's domestic lobbying office last fall, said her
company's stance was driven not by the technology side of the business
but by its studio arm, Warner Bros. She said Warner Bros. has a history
of embracing new technologies, advocating DVDs long before other studios,
for example.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not growing pains from the merger," she said. "It's growing with
the world and trying to break new ground."</TE>
<TE>   Straddling the middle ground in the dispute were Viacom and Vivendi.
News Corp. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. sided with Disney.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Valenti who carried the day with some straight political
talk. He argued that it would be unwise to alienate Hollings, chairman of
the powerful Senate Commerce Committee. Six of the seven MPAA members
fell into line. AOL Time Warner refused to go along, setting up a rare
split vote, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "It was painful for us to do this," said AOL lobbyist Brophy.</TE>
<TE>   The turmoil also forced the MPAA into an embarrassing predicament: The
group endorsed the Hollings bill without reading it.</TE>
<TE>   When Hollings drafted the copyright bill last fall, his office
provided the industry representatives with a courtesy copy, which was
promptly leaked to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Unsure whom they could trust among the jockeying lobbyists, Hollings
staffers refused to release the final bill to most association members
until after it was formally introduced in late March. But Disney and
others were pushing hard for an MPAA endorsement to be included with the
bill's introduction.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept saying, 'Wait. How can we endorse this? I don't have a copy of
the bill,' " recalled Sony Pictures' Hope Boonshaft, who heads lobbying
from Los Angeles. "We weren't allowed to see it."</TE>
<TE>   Some now regret their haste. The final version included some strong
language allowing consumers to make personal copies of movies and music,
a provision most lobbyists had not seen before and did not necessarily
support.</TE>
<TE>   Valenti, who also did not see the final bill, argued that it was
crucial to demonstrate support for Hollings.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't turn your back on someone who is trying to help you," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the growing differences among the major entertainment
companies in his organization, Valenti insists that they still have much
in common, and he takes pride in the motion picture association's track
record of unanimity.</TE>
<TE>   Before the copyright endorsement, the only other split vote he can
recall occurred in the 1990s, when Fox fought other studios to relax
government restrictions on television broadcasters entering programming.
Valenti's "rule of two"--which permits any two MPAA members to veto an
official action--has never been invoked, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining that record will be a challenge, he acknowledges.</TE>
<TE>   "We're much more powerful together than separately," Valenti said. "I
have to work hard to smooth out the lacerations so everyone can sign on."</TE>
